He is perhaps best known for his role in the 1998 film \"Ronin\" and his lead in the TV drama \"Third Watch\".\n\nBorn in Wareham, Massachusetts, the son of an engineer and a nurse, Sudduth attended George Washington High School in Danville, Virginia. Sudduth then earned a Bachelor of Science degree in biology from Hampden-Sydney College (H-SC). He is the older brother of actor Kohl Sudduth.\n\nHe worked for a year as Director of Alumni Relations at his alma mater in the administration of the college's then-new president Josiah Bunting III, author of \"The Lionheads\" and future commandant of Virginia Military Institute in Lexington.\n\nSudduth then worked for a year as apprentice to the winemaker with poet and vintner Tom O'Grady at Rose Bower Vineyard and Winery. At that time, Rose Bower was only the seventh Estate Vineyard to be licensed in Virginia since the time of Thomas Jefferson. During this period, Sudduth was acting in community and campus theater and writing original comedy and directing and producing the annual comedy review, \"Parting Shots\", at H-SC.\n\nThe following year, he returned to school entering the acting program in the Department of Drama at the University of Virginia. At UVA he met and worked with his first and most dynamic acting teacher, Spencer Golub, who would go on to head the Drama Department at Brown University. Golub's emphasis on physically liberating the imagination through extensive guided improvisation became the foundation for Sudduth's approach to acting. Sudduth acted extensively during his time at UVA playing leading roles in Anton Chekhov's \"The Cherry Orchard\", Sam Shepard's \"Curse of the Starving Class\" (opposite \"Nip/Tuck\"'s Dylan Walsh), and Peter Shaffer's \"Equus\", which featured the first full male and female nudity ever allowed on stage in a production at UVA. Sudduth received his Masters of Fine Arts degree in acting from UVA in 1985.\n\nSudduth moved to Chicago in December 1985 aspiring to work with the acclaimed Steppenwolf Theater Company. During his four and a half years in Chicago, Sudduth played in many stage productions including Samuel Beckett's \"Waiting for Godot\", Emily Mann's \"Execution of Justice\", and \"Nebraska\" (by screenwriter John Logan, who penned \"The Aviator\"). He has appeared in stage adaptations of \"The Grapes of Wrath\", \"On the Waterfront\" and \"\", and acted in the 1999 Broadway production of \"The Iceman Cometh\" (alongside Kevin Spacey) and the 2003 debut performance of Woody Allen's play \"Riverside Drive\" (starring with Paul Reiser). He also appeared in \"Twelfth Night\" at Lincoln Center (with Helen Hunt).\n\nSudduth's movie career has seen him play numerous small parts in \"54\" (1998), \"A Cool, Dry Place\" (1998), and Spike Lee's \"Clockers\" (1995), as well larger roles with Robert De Niro in \"Ronin\" (1998) and \"Flawless\" (1999). Sudduth, who is a keen amateur racing/stunt driver, performed nearly all of the driving his character does in \"Ronin\".\n\nSkipp Sudduth had a recurring role in the TV soap opera \"One Life to Live\", but is better known for his portrayal of NYPD officer John \"Sully\" Sullivan in the NBC drama \"Third Watch\". Sudduth appeared in all six seasons of the show and his character is one of the leading ensemble of eight around whom the underlying story arc revolves. He earned his Directors Guild of America card directing the episode \"Collateral Damage, Part II\" in season 4. Sudduth has also made guest appearances in \"\", \"Law & Order\", \"Oz\", \"Trinity\", \"Cosby\", and \"Mad About You\". \n\nThe multi-talented Sudduth is also a singer-songwriter; his acoustic-rock band Minus Ted has released three albums: \"Hope and Damage\" (1994), \"Really Really\" (1999) and \"Hope and Damage Revisited\" (2005). The last two are available on iTunes. He was a member of New York's Rumble in the Redroom comedy troupe (1996–99) and has recorded several notable audio books including one short story in the acclaimed Stephen King collection, \"Just After Sunset\" and Peter Canellos's biography of Ted Kennedy, \"\", both for Simon & Schuster.\n\nIn 2008, Sudduth created the role of Captain George Brackett in the Tony-Award-winning revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein's \"South Pacific\" at Lincoln Center. Sudduth finished the year appearing in the New York premiere of \"Prayer for My Enemy\", a play by Craig Lucas. The play was the second time Sudduth worked with director Bartlett Sher who had also directed \"South Pacific\". The production ran at the off-Broadway theater Playwright's Horizons from November 14 to December 21 and also featured Victoria Clark, Michele Pawk, and Jonathan Groff. In the play, Sudduth played a recovering alcoholic coping with his son's return from the Iraq War.\n\nSudduth officially began his career as a director during his years in the cast of \"Third Watch\" by directing one episode in each of the last three years of the series. Since then, Sudduth has directed episodes of \"ER\", \"Criminal Minds\", \"Women's Murder Club\", CSI: Cyber, and multiple episodes of CSI: NY. He is currently at work developing projects for film, television, and theater. He has recently starred on the short lived police drama \"NYC 22\" as NYPD Detective Tommy Luster.\n\n"}

Ternary fission into three fragments also produces products in the cluster size. The loss of protons from the parent nucleus changes it to the nucleus of a different element, the daughter, with a mass number \"A\" = \"A\" − \"A\" and atomic number \"Z\" = \"Z\" − \"Z\", where \"A\" = \"N\" + \"Z\".\nFor example:\nThis type of rare decay mode was observed in radioisotopes that decay predominantly by alpha emission, and it occurs only in a small percentage of the decays for all such isotopes.\n\nThe branching ratio with respect to alpha decay is rather small (see the Table below).\n\nT and T are the half-lives of the parent nucleus relative to alpha decay and cluster radioactivity, respectively.\n\nCluster decay, like alpha decay, is a quantum tunneling process: in order to be emitted, the cluster must penetrate a potential barrier. This is a different process than the more random nuclear disintegration that precedes light fragment emission in ternary fission, which may be a result of a nuclear reaction, but can also be a type of spontaneous radioactive decay in certain nuclides, demonstrating that input energy is not necessarily needed for fission, which remains a fundamentally different process mechanistically.\n\nTheoretically, any nucleus with \"Z\" > 40 for which the released energy (Q value) is a positive quantity, can be a cluster-emitter. In practice, observations are severely restricted to limitations imposed by currently available experimental techniques which require a sufficiently short half-life, T < 10 s, and a sufficiently large branching ratio B > 10.\n\nIn the absence of any energy loss for fragment deformation and excitation, as in cold fission phenomena or in alpha decay, the total kinetic energy is equal to the Q-value and is divided between the particles in inverse proportion with their masses, as required by conservation of linear momentum\n\nwhere \"A\" is the mass number of the daughter, \"A\" = \"A\" − \"A\".\n\nCluster decay exists in an intermediate position between alpha decay (in which a nucleus spits out a He nucleus), and spontaneous fission, in which a heavy nucleus splits into two (or more) large fragments and an assorted number of neutrons. Spontaneous fission ends up with a probabilistic distribution of daughter products, which sets it apart from cluster decay. In cluster decay for a given radioisotope, the emitted particle is a light nucleus and the decay method always emits this same particle. For heavier emitted clusters, there is otherwise practically no qualitative difference between cluster decay and spontaneous cold fission.\n\nThe first information about the atomic nucleus was obtained at the beginning of the 20th century by studying radioactivity. For a long period of time only three kinds of nuclear decay modes (alpha, beta, and gamma) were known. They illustrate three of the fundamental interactions in nature: strong, weak, and electromagnetic. Spontaneous fission became better studied soon after its discovery in 1940 by Konstantin Petrzhak and Georgy Flyorov because of both the military and the peaceful applications induced fission. This was discovered in about 1939 by Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner, and Fritz Strassmann.\n\nThere are many other kinds of radioactivity, e.g. cluster decay, proton decay, various beta-delayed decay modes (p, 2p, 3p, n, 2n, 3n, 4n, d, t, alpha, f), fission isomers, particle accompanied (ternary) fission, etc. The height of the potential barrier, mainly of Coulomb nature, for emission of the charged particles is much higher than the observed kinetic energy of the emitted particles. The spontaneous decay can only be explained by quantum tunneling in a similar way to the first application of the Quantum Mechanics to Nuclei given by G. Gamow for alpha decay.\n\nUsually the theory explains an already experimentally observed phenomenon. Cluster decay is one of the rare examples of phenomena predicted before experimental discovery. Theoretical predictions were made in 1980,\nfour years before experimental discovery.\n\nFour theoretical approaches were used: fragmentation theory by solving a Schrödinger equation with mass asymmetry as a variable to obtain the mass distributions of fragments; penetrability calculations similar to those used in traditional theory of alpha decay, and superasymmetric fission models, numerical (NuSAF) and analytical (ASAF). Superasymmetric fission models are based on the macroscopic-microscopic approach\nusing the asymmetrical two-center shell model\nlevel energies as input data for the shell and pairing corrections. Either the liquid drop model\nor the Yukawa-plus-exponential model\nextended to different charge-to-mass ratios\nhave been used to calculate the macroscopic deformation energy.\n\nPenetrability theory predicted eight decay modes: C, Ne, Mg, Si, Ar, and Ca from the following parent nuclei: Ra, Th, U, Pu, Cm, Cf, Fm, and No.\n\nThe first experimental report was published in 1984, when physicists at Oxford University discovered that Ra emits one C nucleus among every billion (10) decays by alpha emission.\n\nThe quantum tunneling may be calculated either by extending fission theory to a larger mass asymmetry or by heavier emitted particle from alpha decay theory.\n\nBoth fission-like and alpha-like approaches are able to express the decay constant formula_3 = ln 2 / T, as a product of three model-dependent quantities\n\nwhere formula_5 is the frequency of assaults on the barrier per second, S is the preformation probability of the cluster at the nuclear surface, and P is the penetrability of the external barrier. In alpha-like theories S is an overlap integral of the wave function of the three partners (parent, daughter, and emitted cluster). In a fission theory the preformation probability is the penetrability of the internal part of the barrier from the initial turning point R to the touching point R.\nVery frequently it is calculated by using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation.\n\nA very large number, of the order 10, of parent-emitted cluster combinations were considered in a systematic search for new decay modes. The large amount of computations could be performed in a reasonable time by using the ASAF model developed by Dorin N Poenaru, Walter Greiner, et al. The model was the first to be used to predict measurable quantities in cluster decay. More than 150 cluster decay modes have been predicted before any other kind of half-lives calculations have been reported. Comprehensive tables of half-lives, branching ratios, and kinetic energies have been published, e.g.\nPotential barrier shapes similar to that considered within the ASAF model have been calculated by using the macroscopic-microscopic method.\n\nPreviously\nit was shown that even alpha decay may be considered a particular case of cold fission. The ASAF model may be used to describe in a unified manner cold alpha decay, cluster decay, and cold fission (see figure 6.7, p. 287 of the Ref. [2]).\n\nOne can obtain with good approximation one universal curve (UNIV) for any kind of cluster decay mode with a mass number Ae, including alpha decay\n\nIn a logarithmic scale the equation log T = f(log P) represents a single straight line which can be conveniently used to estimate the half-life. A single universal curve for alpha decay and cluster decay modes results by expressing log T + log S = f(log P).\nThe experimental data on cluster decay in three groups of even-even, even-odd, and odd-even parent nuclei are reproduced with comparable accuracy by both types of universal curves, fission-like UNIV and UDL\nderived using alpha-like R-matrix theory.\n\nIn order to find the released energy\n\none can use the compilation of measured masses\nM, M, and M of the parent, daughter, and emitted nuclei, c is the light velocity. The mass excess is transformed into energy according to the Einstein's formula E = mc.\n\nThe main experimental difficulty in observing cluster decay comes from the need to identify a few rare events among an enormous number of background alpha particle. The quantities experimentally determined are the partial half life, T, and the kinetic energy of the emitted cluster E. There is also a need to identify the emitted particle.\n\nDetection of radiations is based on their interactions with matter, leading mainly to ionizations. Using a semiconductor telescope and conventional electronics to identify the C ions, the Rose and Jones's experiment was running for about six months in order to get 11 useful events.\n\nWith modern magnetic spectrometers (SOLENO and Enge-split pole), at Orsay and Argonne National Laboratory (see ch. 7 in Ref. [2] pp. 188–204), a very strong source could be used, so that results were obtained in a run of few hours.\n\nSolid state nuclear track detectors (SSNTD) insensitive to alpha particles and magnetic spectrometers in which alpha particles are deflected by a strong magnetic field have been used to overcome this difficulty. SSNTD are cheap and handy but they need chemical etching and microscope scanning.\n\nA key role in experiments on cluster decay modes performed in Berkeley, Orsay, Dubna, and Milano was played by P. Buford Price, Eid Hourany, Michel Hussonnois, Svetlana Tretyakova, A. A. Ogloblin, Roberto Bonetti, and their coworkers.\n\nThe main region of 20 emitters experimentally observed until 2010 is above Z=86: Fr, Ra, Ac, Th, Pa, U, Pu, and Cm. Only upper limits could be detected in the following cases: C decay of Ba, N decay of Ac, O decay of Th, Ne decays of Th and of U, Mg decays of U, Mg decay of Np, and Si decay of Pu and of Am.\n\nSome of the cluster emitters are members of the three natural radioactive families. Others should be produced by nuclear reactions. Up to now no odd-odd emitter has been observed.\n\nFrom many decay modes with half-lives and branching ratios relative to alpha decay predicted with the analytical superasymmetric fission (ASAF) model, the following 11 have been experimentally confirmed: C, O, F, Ne, Mg, and Si. The experimental data are in good agreement with predicted values. A strong shell effect can be seen: as a rule the shortest value of the half-life is obtained when the daughter nucleus has a magic number of neutrons (N = 126) and/or protons (Z = 82).\n\nThe known cluster emissions as of 2010 are as follows:\n\nThe fine structure in C radioactivity of Ra was discussed for the\nfirst time by M. Greiner and W. Scheid in 1986.\nThe superconducting spectrometer SOLENO of IPN Orsay has been used since 1984 to identify C clusters emitted from Ra nuclei. Moreover, it was used to discover\nthe fine structure observing transitions to excited states of the daughter. A transition with an excited state of C predicted in Ref. was not yet observed.\n\nSurprisingly, the experimentalists had seen a transition to the first excited state of the daughter stronger than that to the ground state. The transition is favoured if the uncoupled nucleon is left in the same state in both parent and daughter nuclei. Otherwise the difference in nuclear structure leads to a large hindrance.\n\nThe interpretation\nwas confirmed: the main spherical component of the deformed parent wave function has an i character, i.e. the main component is spherical.\n\n"}

In May 2016, a strategic decision was made to sell all of the Ontario cinemas to Imagine Cinemas, except for the Cobourg location. With Magic Lantern and Rainbow operate 43 screens, it is the fourth largest movie chain across Canada behind Cineplex Entertainment, Landmark Cinemas and Imagine Cinemas.\n\nThe chain currently operates Rainbow Cinemas theatres in Regina, Saskatoon, and Magic Lantern Theatres in Camrose, Peace River, St. Paul, Whitecourt, and Fort Saskatchewan. Magic Lantern was responsible for restoring the interior of the formerly derelict Garneau Theatre, near the University of Alberta in Edmonton. It managed this location until June 2011, when its exterior was restored and the theatre was taken over by Metro Cinema Edmonton, a local nonprofit.\n\nIn 2010, the company acquired the Carlton Cinemas theatre in downtown Toronto, a historic venue for independent and arthouse films which was closed by Cineplex Odeon in fall 2009.

The fruit is an ovoid capsule, about 6 mm long containing several seeds that ripen underwater. The seeds are 4–5 mm long, fusiform, glabrous (round), and narrowly cylindrical. It flowers from May to October.\n\nIt grows rapidly in favorable conditions and can choke shallow ponds, canals, and the margins of some slow-flowing rivers. It requires summer water temperatures of 10–25 °C and moderate to bright lighting.\n\nIt is closely related to \"Elodea nuttallii\", which generally has narrower leaves under 2 mm broad. It is usually fairly easy to distinguish from its relatives, like the Brazilian \"Egeria densa\" and \"Hydrilla verticillata\". These all have leaves in whorls around the stem; however, \"Elodea\" usually has three leaves per whorl, whereas \"Egeria\" and \"Hydrilla\" usually have four or more leaves per whorl. \"Egeria densa\" is also a larger, bushier plant with longer leaves.\n\nIt is frequently used as an aquarium plant. Propagation is by cuttings.\n\nIt is an invasive species in Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia. It was introduced into County Down, Ireland in about 1836, and appeared in Great Britain in 1841, spreading through both countries in ponds, ditches and streams, which were often choked with its rank growth.\n\nOther common names for this plant include \"Anacharis\" (an older name for the genus \"Elodea\"), water thyme, common elodea, and ditch moss.\n"}

{"id": "2094506", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2094506", "title": "Mexicools", "text": "Mexicools\n\nThe Mexicools are a professional wrestling stable and tag team, that were signed to World Wrestling Entertainment's SmackDown! brand. The team consisted of three well-known Mexican wrestlers of the late 1990s: Super Crazy, Psicosis and Juventud. The stable became a tag team when their unofficial leader Juventud was released from WWE on January 6, 2006. The team's gimmick was that of a group of Mexican wrestlers who were fed up with the stereotypical portrayals of Mexicans in the United States as laborers for the \"gringos.\" They frequently parodied this view of Mexicans with their interviews and skits. Following their release from WWE, the group has reformed on the independent circuit in various promotions.\n\nThe Mexicools made their debut as villains on June 23, 2005, when all three members rode to the ring on a John Deere lawn mower, with the sticker saying the more Hispanic-sounding name Juan Deere, and wearing matching coveralls. They attacked both Chavo Guerrero and Paul London during a WWE Cruiserweight Championship match.\n\nJuventud cut a promo questioning the lack of \"true Mexican Luchadores\" in WWE's cruiserweight division, before going on to deride the current state of Mexican Americans in general. Psicosis dubbed the lawnmower they arrived on a \"Mexican Limo 2005\" and the group claimed that even Mexico's President mocks Mexicans in the United States (referring to Vicente Fox's controversial remark that Mexican immigrants do the jobs \"not even the blacks want to do\"). Juventud then stated that they were \"no longer there to clean toilets and work for \"them\" (the \"gringos\") but \"they\" were going to be working for \"us\" (The Mexicools)\", before dubbing the team \"not Mexi\"cans\" but Mexi\"cools\"!\" In the following weeks, they would continue to interfere in matches and mock the stereotypical image of Mexicans in the United States, even coming to the ring each with their own riding lawnmower.\n\nThey had their debut match on the July 14 episode of \"SmackDown!\", a victory over Paul London, Funaki and Scotty 2 Hotty. They made their pay-per-view debut at The Great American Bash, defeating the reunited Blue World Order. In the following weeks, they would interfere in matches involving William Regal and in Christian's \"Peep Show\" interview segment.\n\nThe Mexicools next feuded with the heel Full Blooded Italians on Velocity, and this saw the group turn into fan favorites. Juventud won a Cruiserweight Battle Royal that included all three Mexicools, thus earning a match for the Cruiserweight Title at the 2005 No Mercy event. Juventud would win the match at No Mercy and the title.\n\nThe Mexicools would then turn their attention to winning the WWE Tag Team Championship. Juventud lost the Cruiserweight Title at a house show in Italy. That week, on the \"SmackDown!\" Tribute Show to Eddie Guerrero all three Mexicools participated in an interpromotional battle royal, which Juventud won. On the November 25 \"SmackDown!\", Juventud defeated Nunzio to become the Cruiserweight Champion once more. On the December 2 \"SmackDown!\", Psicosis and Super Crazy won a number one contenders battle royal to face tag champions MNM at Armageddon 2005. This became just a regular tag match after MNM lost the WWE Tag Team Championship on the last \"SmackDown!\" before Armageddon to Rey Mysterio and Batista. At Armageddon Juventud lost his Cruiserweight Title to Kid Kash, and MNM defeated Super Crazy and Psicosis with help from Melina.\nAfter repeated backstage problems, Juventud was released from WWE on January 6, 2006, leaving Psicosis and Super Crazy as the only remaining team members. On February 3, 2006, Super Crazy and Psicosis bounced back by nearly defeating MNM in a tag title defense. They appeared to have the gold in the grasp, but their dreams of winning the titles went up in smoke when Melina hit Super Crazy with her boot as he went for a moonsault. MNM capitalized and retained.\n\nFollowing Juventud's departure from WWE, Psicosis and Super Crazy slowly started to diminish as a tag team. Crazy would see success as a singles superstar, winning most of his major matches, including a triple threat number one contendership match for the Cruiserweight title against Nunzio and Kid Kash. Psicosis failed to appear on WWE television for several weeks. Following Super Crazy's loss to Gregory Helms for the title at Judgment Day 2006, he and Psicosis reunited.\n\nSeeds of a split seemed to appear in mid-2006 around the same time as the redevelopment of the ECW brand. During a tag-team match on \"Velocity\" the Mexicools faced the reigning tag champions Paul London and Brian Kendrick. Although both teams respected each other during the match, Psicosis used the ropes to pick up an illegal pinfall to win the match. This led to Super Crazy questioning Psicosis' actions. Next, during a \"SmackDown!\" broadcast, Psicosis left Crazy to be attacked by The Great Khali after a match, saving his own skin and leaving his tag team partner to fend for himself. Psicosis would later abandon Crazy during a handicap match against Khali. On the June 23 edition of \"SmackDown!\", Super Crazy and Psicosis got into a fist-fight after various miscommunications throughout the match, marking the split of the team. The two were still billed as members of the faction in the following weeks, even though they were interfering in each other's matches, until they had a match on an episode of \"SmackDown!\" which was won by Super Crazy. After the split, Super Crazy was moved to the Raw brand, while Psicosis stayed on SmackDown. On November 1, 2006, Psicosis' WWE contract was officially terminated by WWE because of his arrest in Mexico for stealing a car.\n\nThe group has regularly teamed together on the independent circuit in Mexico and the United States following their WWE stint.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2094518", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2094518", "title": "Connotation (semiotics)", "text": "Connotation (semiotics)\n\nIn semiotics, connotation arises when the denotative relationship between a signifier and its signified is inadequate to serve the needs of the community. A second level of meanings is termed connotative. These meanings are not objective representations of the \"thing\", but new usages produced by the language group.\n\nDrawing from the original definition proposed by Saussure (1857–1913), a sign has two parts:\nConnotative meanings are developed by the community and do not represent the inherent qualities of the thing or concept originally signified as the meaning. The addition of such meanings introduces complexity into the coding system. If a signifier has only a single denotational meaning, the use of the sign will always be unambiguously decoded by the audience. But connotative meanings are context-dependent, i.e. the addresser must learn how to match the meaning intended by the addresser to one of the various possible meanings held in memory. \n\nThe power of connotation is that it enables the addresser to more easily consider abstract concepts and to introduce subtlety into the discourse. For example, a digital thermometer produces a numerical value that indicates the current state of a specific operational parameter. This technology provides an \"indexical\" sign of heat (adopting the classification of Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914), an indexical sign by real connection between the signifier and the signified). The number is a denotative value, i.e. it speaks only for itself. The doctor, nurse or patient will relate to the number as a visual trope, in this case a metaphor, for the health of the body. Such information adds to other data forming a symptomology for the patient, a summation that takes place at a connotative cognitive level. Hence, the meanings as to health or illness are selected from the connotational framework which the interpreter has constructed through training and experience given that each possible state of well-being is represented by a cluster of symbolic attributes, one of which is the patient's temperature.\n\nConnotation is concerned with how the sign system is used in each message. The semantic content is selected by the addresser and represents that individual's values and intentions. Limiting an analysis purely to the sign system comprised by paradigms and syntagms excludes key elements in the interpretive process. Thus, subjective tests such as the commutation test have been developed to map connotations and so decode more of the addresser's intentions. This is achieved by changing the form of the signifiers, by substituting signifiers to assess what the alternative connotations would be and by considering what signifiers are absent and why their absences might be significant. Changes of form would require substituting different fonts for the same text, or different colours or designs for the same visual content. The use of synonyms and antonyms clarifies connotational choices as between, say, pejorative and euphemistic usages. As to absences, if a modern image of a group of people employed in a major public enterprise only contains individuals of the same gender and ethnicity, the analyst would enquire into the significance of the exclusion of those of the opposite gender and a different ethnicity. The editorial decision may be supporting social values, attitudes and beliefs that are embedded into the culture—for example, that nations ought to conscript only men to serve on the front-lines of a war. Other explanations of different contexts may expose cultural myths and prejudices which are less reasonable.\n\n\n"}

MFS is also a member of the New Jersey Association of Independent Schools and the Association of Delaware Valley Independent Schools.\n\nDuring the 1991-92 school year, Moorestown Friends School was awarded the Blue Ribbon School Award of Excellence by the United States Department of Education, the highest award an American school can receive.\n\nIn 2007, Barbara Quinn Kreider, chair of the science department and chemistry teacher, was recognized as the New Jersey parochial school teacher of the year, after her successful freshmen science program was rated number one in the country.\n\nHistorian James C. Scott dedicated his 1990 book \"Domination and the Arts of Resistance\" to Moorestown Friends School.\n\nIn 1781, a two-acre lot, located near the intersection of Chester Avenue and Main Street, was purchased. In 1785, a stone schoolhouse was erected and Joshua Hunt was the first teacher. In 1784, a lot at the western side of the community was purchased and a brick schoolhouse was erected.\n\nIn 1827, the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting, which the Moorestown Monthly Meeting is a part of, split into the Orthodox and Hicksite meetings. The Orthodox school stayed on the current site under the name \"Moorestown Friends Academy\", while a Hicksite school called \"Moorestown Friends High School\" a block away. The two schools recombined under the name \"Moorestown Friends School\" in 1920 at the current site.\n\nUpper school at MFS includes grades 9 through 12.\n\nThe total average SAT score for the Class of 2013 was 1886, made up of Critical Reading 630, Math 628 and Writing 628.\n\nAll Upper School students must complete 50 hours of community service, and many participate in service trips to places like New Orleans, the Florida Everglades, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Tanzania.

Technology is an important component of education at MFS. Faculty advisors meet with middle school students daily to help them develop effective study skills.\n\nMiddle school extracurricular activities include choir, band, theater, student government, robotics, architecture, web design, and newspaper. The students also have a variety of sports to choose from. Each Middle School grade level has a unique outdoor educational experience.\n\nLower school at MFS includes preschool through grade 4.\n\nDuring the 2012-2013 school year, the early childhood program at Moorestown Friends School rebranded itself as \"Beginnings at MFS\" to stress the importance of preschool, prekindergarten, and kindergarten in a child's development.\n\"We consider the education of young children to be work of enormous importance.

MFS has a Camden Scholars Coordinator who serves as a liaison to help participants adjust to their new learning environment and sustain a healthy and successful academic and extracurricular schedule. The school's Diversity Coordinator oversees student, employee and curricular diversity efforts throughout the entire school with the aid of a faculty/staff sub-committee.\n\nEach week, the MFS community gathers in the Meetinghouse, built in 1802, for Meeting for Worship. There are separate Meetings for each school division.\n\nFriends believe that each person has within him/herself, with God's help, the ability to discern truth. Participants use this time to pray, or worship or simply reflect deeply on the world around them, according to their own faith traditions.\n\nSince Friends believe that each person, no matter their age, is able to discern truth, all are welcome to speak from their hearts if so moved. It is expected that their words will be listened to from the same deep connection to the Spirit and provide insight for the listeners.

{"id": "2094535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2094535", "title": "Baltimore News-American", "text": "Baltimore News-American\n\nThe Baltimore News-American was a broadsheet newspaper published in downtown Baltimore, Maryland until May 27, 1986. It had a continuous lineage (in various forms) of more than 200 years. For much of the mid-20th Century, it had the largest circulation in the city.\n\nThe entity known as the \"News American\" was formed by a final merger of two papers, the \"Baltimore News-Post\" and \"The Baltimore Sunday American\", in 1964, after a 191-year history and weaning process. Those newspapers each had a long history before the merger, in particular the \"Baltimore American\" which could trace its lineage unbroken to at least 1796, and, traditionally, it claimed even earlier antecedents to 1773. Other precursor newspapers \"The News\" and the \"Baltimore Post\" were founded in 1873 and 1922, respectively, and broke new ground in graphics, technology, journalistic style, and quality of writing and reporting.\n\nFor most of the last two-thirds of the 19th Century, the buildings of the two main newspapers of the city faced each other across South Street along East Baltimore Street, with \"The Sun\"'s \"Iron Building\" of revolutionary cast iron front design reflecting the earliest \"skyscraper\" construction technique of 1851. Built opposite later in 1873, was \"The News\" office/printing establishment featured a mansard roof and a corner clock tower. Longtime owner/editor Charles H. Grasty, who bought the \"Evening News\" in 1892, directed the newspaper's coverage of the burgeoning, gritty late-19th Century city, using advanced presses and techniques of graphics, line drawings. and larger headlines in the short days before the advent of printed page photographs.\n\nCompeting with \"the other paper\" across the street, bulletin boards, chalk boards across the second floor front of the building and hawking \"newsies\" (newspaper delivery boys) with the latest news, telegraphed election results made the intersection the hottest place to be in the Victorian downtown central district.\n\nAll this perished in smoke with the \"Great Baltimore Fire\" of February 1904, which burned out both buildings. Publication was temporarily shifted to other neighboring cities such as Washington, D.C. \n\nCharles and Baltimore Streets, at the geographic center of Baltimore, became the site of a new marble Beaux Arts classicalstyle publishing offices for \"The Sunpapers\" for the next 45 years. The corner was nicknamed \"Sun Square.\" The \"Baltimore American\" had a towering office skyscraper, the American Building, quickly rebuilt on the same site with a distinctive elaborate green ground floor with gold lettering showing the newspaper's logo and masthead and the dates 1773 and 1904 over the doorways. An additional printing plant several blocks south was located on East Pratt between South and Commerce streets, facing what then was called \"The Basin\" and its wharves, and today is known as the Inner Harbor. It, too, was built after the 1904 Great Fire, which devastated most of downtown Baltimore. \n\nAn additional office building a block north, facing East Lombard Street, was built later in 1924 and supplemented with a more modern printing plant between the two buildings along the South Street side in 1965 after the final merger of the \"News-Post\" and \"the American\". The South Street complex was torn down several years after the newspaper's closing in 1986, and remained a parking lot and a source of controversy for Inner Harbor area redevelopment. With the construction of a massive tower initially named Commerce Place (which later became headquarters, and renamed for the longtime local investment/financial/banking firm Alex. Brown & Sons following take-over by Germany's Deutsche Bank) on the block between South and Commerce streets in 1991, the intersection and battleground of Baltimore and South Streets (and intersecting North Street [later Guilford Avenue]) today are now relatively unknown for the \"Newspaper Wars\" that ebbed and flowed there through most of the 1800s.\n\nAlso one of the casualties of \"The Great Fire\" was the \"Baltimore Morning Herald\" which had been founded in February 1900 and combined with the \"Baltimore Evening Herald\" on August 31, 1904, six months after sustaining the damage from having its headquarters building at the northwestern corner of St. Paul and East Fayette Streets consumed by the blaze although the new massive City Circuit Courthouse (now the Clarence Mitchell, Jr. Courthouse) just to the east across the street, recently completed four years earlier, was unharmed. The new editor, employed for only four years so far since graduating from Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, young Henry Louis Mencken was thrown out of his office and arrangements had to be made to print the paper in another city and ship them back into Baltimore.\n\nSeveral years later, in June 1906, \"The Herald\" was bought out by competitors Grasty and his \"News\" joined with Gen. Felix Agnus, owner/publisher of the venerable \"The Baltimore American\" and the staff, assets and resources divided between the two older papers that were now the largest in the city. Mencken described his early reporting years in the second volume of his autobiographical trilogy \"Newspaper Days\" published in 1941.\n\nThe \"Baltimore American\", claimed to be a direct descendant of the original \"Maryland Journal and Baltimore Advertiser\" was founded in 1773 and had a long-time editor/publisher with C.C. Fulton during the middle 19th Century. After the American Civil War, Felix Agnus, returned from the war and settled in Baltimore and became manager of the \"American\" and eventually married the Fulton's daughter. Within a decade, he became the editor and publisher following the death of Fulton. Agnus, who was born in Paris and having earlier served in the Imperial French Army of Napoleon III, was a major with the 165th New York Regiment and late in the war he was breveted a brigadier general in March 1865, and he continued using the title after retiring. He became very active in a variety of civic, social and political affairs of the city, including heading up the Centre Market Commission, which was responsible for rebuilding the Market Place after the devastation caused by the Great Baltimore Fire of February 1904. He was also very proud that his new skyscraper for the \"American\" was the first to be completed in early 1905 in the \"burnt district.\" He died in October 1925 at 86, several years after selling the paper to a very controversial and often hated man in America.\n\nWilliam Randolph Hearst's Hearst Company newspaper empire acquired the morning \"American\" from Agnus and the afternoon \"News\" from Grasty in 1923 from another newspaper mogul Frank A. Munsey (who also owned the \"New York Herald\", \"New York Sun\", \"New York Telegraph\" and \"Washington Times\"). Known as the \"Dealer in Dailies\" and the \"Undertaker of Journalism\", Munsey purchased \"The News\" in 1908, just two years after the paper had been forced out from its burned-out headquarters across from \"The Sun\" into a new skyscraper and publishing tower at the southeast corner of North Calvert Street and East Fayette Street (across from the Battle Monument Square, which had survived untouched on the northern edge of the \"Burnt District\"). As the first non-resident owner of \"The American\" in its already long history, but not satisfied with this new property of \"The News\" headquarters, Munsey promptly tore it down just a few years later and rebuilt it in 1911 in larger and grander style as the then briefly tallest building in Baltimore, designed by the famed architectural firms of Baldwin & Pennington of Baltimore and McKim, Mead and White of New York City and named it The Munsey Building, with large ground-floor windows so passers-by could see the massive printing presses which printed the day's papers.\n\nMumsey also became the owner of a new large local bank known as The Munsey Trust Company, founded in 1913 and later reorganized in 1915 into The Equitable Trust Company with Munsey as chairman of the board. It became one of the city and state's largest financial empires into the 1990s. However, by 1924, when \"The News\" moved to new offices and printing presses at East Pratt and Commerce Streets facing the waterfront's wharves, the building was again renovated into the bank's headquarters for the next seventy years until another transformation after a series of bank mergers and out-of-town ownership take-overs in the early 2000s made it into apartments and condos. The Scripps-Howard \"Baltimore Post\", a late-comer to the local newspaper scene, founded 1922 was later acquired and merged with \"The News\" by the Hearst Company in 1936 to create the \"Baltimore News-Post\" under the Hearst banner along with the old ancient \"The Baltimore American\", which was published now only on Sundays.\n\nIn 1964, the \"News-Post\" and \"American\" became published as \"The News American\" with a newly designed masthead logo and vignette (sketch) and was now the largest circulation daily in Baltimore, especially prominent in the working-class and blue-collar districts until the early 1970s. A series of format changes and staff realignments alienated many readers under a new editing regime in 1977, along with new problems delivering an afternoon paper through the after-work day traffic congestion (\"drive time\") to the outer suburbs and changing evening leisure habits of the middle classes not allowing much time for paper reading so circulation slowly declined after it had been the largest in the metro area. After the paper's last edition was published on May 27, 1986 with the headline: \"So Long, Baltimore\", its demise left \"The Baltimore Sun\" (founded 1837, it had just coincidentally been sold several weeks earlier by the longtime family publishers A.S. Abell Company to the national syndicate and newspaper chain Times-Mirror Company of the \"Los Angeles Times\") as the sole broad-circulation daily in Baltimore, but it was not announced publicly until after the surprise folding of its main competitor.\n\nThe stunning news of the multimillion-dollar sale was just announced several days after equally stunning closure of \"News American\", leaving \"The Sun\" published in the morning and \"The Evening Sun\" (founded 1910) in the afternoon as the only papers left. Separate staffs and content were maintained until the early 1990s when the editions became similar until September 15, 1995, when the evening paper was finally dis-continued with a sad banner \"Good Night, Hon\" and many of its features and staff combined with the morning paper, which eventually was renamed and publicized as \"The Baltimore Sun\" by 2005. \n\nIn 2000, Times-Mirror Company merged with the Tribune Company of the \"Chicago Tribune\" to form a larger syndicate including \"The Baltimore Sun\", which later entered into bankruptcy in 2009 for four years after being acquired by billionaire investor Sam Zell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the newly revamped \"News American\" is published seven days a week with the usually thick special Sunday edition of many sections. Masthead is redesigned with new vignette with old Phoenix Shot Tower in center and city skyline buildings behind, surmounted by the traditional Hearst stylized eagle. For the first time, paper is referred to without city name on masthead. A new prprinting presses plant structure constructed in the center of block between East Pratt and East Lombard Streets, joining previous structures facing opposite directions with loading docks on east side facing Commerce Street and large brick wall facing on South Street side on the west where huge anodized aluminum name plate is attached, visible from both streets and passing traffic next to new entrance lobby (with exhibits and display boards with history of newspapers) . Entrances on Pratt and Lombard are closed. Paper uses postal new address on South Street.\n\n\n"}

She operated in the Mediterranean Sea, Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean during the Second World War. She was later used as a barracks ship and then a prison ship in Northern Ireland.\n\nShe was built to support the increasing number of submarines, especially on distant stations, such as the Mediterranean Sea and the Pacific Far East. Her equipment included a foundry, coppersmith's, plumber's and carpenter's shops, heavy and light machine shops, electrical and torpedo repair shops and plants for charging submarine batteries. She was designed to look after nine operational submarines, supplying over 100 torpedoes and a similar number of mines. Besides large workshops, there were repair facilities for all material in the attached submarines and extensive diving and salvage equipment was carried. There were steam laundries, a cinema, hospital, chapel, two canteens, a bakery, barber's shop, and a fully equipped operating theatre and dental surgery.\n\nIn September 1939 \"Maidstone\" was depot ship to the ten submarines of the 1st Submarine Flotilla. In March 1941 she went to Gibraltar. From November 1942, \"Maidstone\" was based at Algiers Harbour, the main Allied base in the Mediterranean. In November 1943 she was assigned to the Eastern Fleet. In September 1944 \"Maidstone\" and the 8th Submarine Flotilla were transferred from Ceylon to Fremantle in Western Australia to operate in the Pacific.\n\nIn late 1945 \"Maidstone\" left Fremantle, and en route to the UK, docked in the Selborne dry dock at Simonstown, South Africa. While on passage, she was diverted to Macassar to pick up 400 British naval prisoners of war from , HMS \"Encounter\" and HMS \"Stronghold\". In November 1945 she arrived at Portsmouth.\n\nDuring the war \"Maidstone\" was adopted by the Borough of Maidstone as part of \"Warship Week\". The plaque from this adoption is held by the National Museum of the Royal Navy in Portsmouth.\n\nIn 1946 \"Maidstone\" became mother ship to the 2nd and 7th Submarine Flotillas. The 2nd Flotilla comprised operational boats, the latter a trials and training squadron. \"Maidstone\" had a semi-permanent mooring off Monkey Island (Portland) but often put to sea with her brood. In 1951 \"Maidstone\" called briefly at Corunna to land a sick crewman. This was not classified an official visit, although it was the first time a British warship had entered a Spanish harbour since the end of the Spanish Civil War. In 1953 she took part in the Fleet Review to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nOn 16 June 1955 the submarine sank in Portland harbour alongside \"Maidstone\" 20 minutes after an explosion in the forward torpedo compartment. A rescue party from \"Maidstone\" saved a number of the \"Sidon\"s crew, but 13 died. A week later, the submarine was raised and the accident was found to be caused by the high-test peroxide fuel in a torpedo. Surgeon Lieutenant Charles Rhodes was posthumously awarded the Albert Medal for his part in the rescue.\n\nIn 1956 \"Maidstone\" was the flagship of the Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet. In September 1957, the Soviet Union protested when \"Maidstone\" accompanied the training aircraft carrier on a visit to Helsinki. In 1959 \"Maidstone\" received an extensive refit to accommodate nuclear submarines and the 2nd Flotilla was then moved to Devonport. In 1961 \"Maidstone\" sailed to Faslane, on Gareloch, where she was the depot ship to the 3rd and 10th Submarine Squadrons. In 1965 she undertook a trip to Liverpool, and she visited the same port one year later. She also undertook a trip to Rothesay during this period and then in 1968 she sailed to Rosyth Dockyard to undertake preparations to \"mothball\" her. The Norwegian navy considered buying her, as did HM Prison Service, who decided the facilities onboard, used by hundreds of sailors, were only suitable for 50 or so prisoners.\n\nIn October 1969 \"Maidstone\" was refitted and re-commissioned as accommodation for 2,000 troops and sent to Belfast. In 1969 she arrived under tow at Belfast to serve as barracks for the increased security forces in the area. In 1971, she was used as a prison ship in Operation Demetrius as a place to hold internees without trial, including Gerry Adams. The holding area itself was at the stern and consisted of two bunkhouses, one up, one down, and two messrooms. Above these were the rooms of the governor and his staff (previously the captain's cabin) and above this was the deck, used twice a day for exercise. The deck was surrounded by -high barbed wire. She was moored in Belfast harbour from the land, entry to the jetty being guarded by sand-bagged army emplacements. \"Maidstone\" was also notable for a successful escape by seven Provisional IRA members on 17January 1972. The men swam close to through icy water and evaded army and police. They later held a press conference.\n\nOn 23 May 1978 \"Maidstone\" was broken up for scrap at the Thos W Ward scrapyard in Inverkeithing. Her bell is now located at Maidstone Grammar School, where it is rung to signify the start of assemblies.\n\n"}

It was designed as a lower-cost replacement for the Austin Champ, to compete directly with Rover's Land Rover. Like the Land Rover, it was aimed at both the civilian and military markets.\n\nPost-war, the FV1800 Nuffield \"Mudlark\", later to become the FV1801 Austin Champ, had been designed as the first of the new CT series of soft-skin military vehicles for the British Army. The Mudlark used the new Rolls-Royce B40 engine, all-independent suspension based on Tracta joints and a 24V electrical system with a two-speed high-capacity generator capable of powering a FFW version. Despite these technical features, the resultant vehicle was not popular or successful, being seen as over-complicated, and a maintenance and repair nightmare. The Champ was also expensive, compared to simpler vehicles. The later Gipsy was a reaction to both the failure of the Champ, and the success of the Land Rover.\n\nBoth the Champ and the Gipsy were significantly different from the American Jeep, the Gipsy being much closer in design, appearance and price to the Land Rover. \n\nUnlike the Land Rover, the Gipsy's bodywork was steel. The suspension was sophisticated, independent suspension all round using \"Flexitor\" rubber springs developed by Alex Moulton, giving the Gipsy the ability to travel at high speeds over rough terrain. In due course, later models offered leaf springs as an option on the front and rear. It used a BMC 2199 cc petrol engine based on the one in the Austin A70; the compression ratio was 6.8:1, making the petrol-powered vehicle tolerant of low octane fuel. A 2178 cc diesel-engined version was also offered. The Gipsy was first available with a 90-inch (2286 mm) short wheelbase (SWB). A 111-inch (2819 mm) long wheelbase (LWB) version became available from Series II.\n\nWhen BMC merged with Leyland to form British Leyland, the Austin Gipsy and the Land Rover were being produced by the same company. Production of the Gipsy was stopped after some 21,208 vehicles had been sold.\n\nThe Austin Gipsy was assembled from CKD packs in New Zealand at the Austin distributor's Petone factory which was directly opposite Todd Motor's assembly plant for Rootes Group and Chrysler Australia's products.\nAustin Maxis were later assembled in the same factory.\n\n\n"}

Nineteen-year-old Gutierrez tipped police off when he speculated he thought someone had killed her and stuffed her body in the building's crawlspace. He was working at the funeral parlor and had recently been laid off and was being evicted. Area 5 Cmdr. Lee Epplen of the Chicago Police stated that Stachowicz and Gutierrez got into an argument after the woman tried to persuade him to change his lifestyle, police and prosecutors said. Gutierrez told police he became enraged after Stachowicz questioned him, said Cook County Assistant State's Atty. Nancy Galassini during a bond hearing. Gutierrez claimed that she proceeded to ask him \"Why do you sleep with boys?\", after which he became even more angry and Nancy Galassini said \"The defendant punched and kicked and stabbed the victim until he was tired.

Pennsylvania's first female lieutenant governor, Catherine Baker Knoll, was also running for re-election.\n\nRendell and Knoll had the advantage of incumbency, important in the swing state of Pennsylvania. Rendell's approval rating as of May 2006 was 62%.\n\nIn the 2000 Presidential election, then Vice President Al Gore won the state 51%-47% over then Texas Governor George W. Bush. In 2004, Senator John Kerry carried the state 51%-49% over incumbent President Bush.\n\nAlthough the state had voted Democratic in eight of the past 12 presidential elections, its Congressional delegation had been majority Republican for years. The counties of Philadelphia and Allegheny are the Democratic strongholds (Philadelphia: 75% Democrat, Allegheny: 60% Democrat), while the central part of the state is where the Republican Party fares best. The 2005 statewide party registration had Democrats out-numbering Republicans in the state 3,841,429 to 3,292,656, with 939,252 registered independent voters.\n\nMichael Morrill, the Green Party's nominee for governor in 2002, considered challenging Rendell on a progressive liberal platform. On February 13, 2006, Morrill however stated that he would not run, citing the toll his 2002 race took on his family. Rendell thus ran unopposed.\n\nLynn Swann, Jeff Piccola, Jim Panyard and Bill Scranton III all announced their intention to run in the Republican primary for governor in 2006. Scranton, who served two terms as lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania, is the son of popular former Governor William Scranton, and a member of the wealthy and politically influential Scranton family, was the early front-runner. However, a series of blunders by his campaign, and a lack of momentum from the Piccola and Panyard campaigns moved Swann into presumptive nominee status. The state Republican party then endorsed Swann, leading the three other candidates to drop out ahead of the March deadline to file for the primary.\n\n\n\n\nFour candidates were campaigning for governor, but only two went on to appear on the ballot in November. Rendell and Swann both were unopposed for their respective major party nominations. Constitution candidate Hagan Smith and Independent candidate Russ Diamond were unable to secure the necessary signatures to appear on the ballot. On August 11, Green Party candidate Marakay Rogers withdrew her nominating papers, following a challenge by Pennsylvania Democrats, who alleged more than 69,000 signatures on the petitions were fake names, unregistered voters or illegible.\nThe challenge followed Republican Senator Rick Santorum's drive to collect signatures to put Green candidate Carl Romanelli on the ballot.\n\nRogers continued to campaign, hopeful that a federal appeals court would rule favorably in a lawsuit seeking to overturn the state's signature requirement for third party candidates. \n\n\nChallenging Rendell was former Pittsburgh Steelers Hall of Famer, Lynn Swann (R). His running mate was businessman Jim Matthews, Montgomery County Commisoner and the brother of MSNBC's Chris Matthews.\nIn July 2005, a Zogby Poll showed Rendell with only a 47% to 41% lead over Lynn Swann. Some speculated that controversy over Act 72, proposed Medicaid cuts, and possibly even a legislative pay increase that was signed into law had reduced the Governor's popularity. Also, when compared to other polls, the six percent lead was an outlier. Rendell has led in other recent polls by significantly higher margins.\n\nFollowing that poll, Rendell's supporters pointed out that he has raised more money than his opponents, which they felt would help him spread his message. They also pointed out that no Pennsylvania governor had lost re-election since the 1950s, [until the PA Constitutional Convention of 1968, Pennsylvania governors were limited to one consecutive term—therefore a correct statement would be \"no PA governor has lost a bid for re-election since 1970\"] and that, as a sitting governor, Rendell had all of the traditional advantages of an incumbent.\n\nSwann hoped to perform strongly in the conservative \"T\" section of the state (the central and northern regions) and in his native western Pennsylvania area. On 7 February 2006 Swann served as master of ceremonies for the Pittsburgh Steelers's Super Bowl XL victory parade before 250,000 people. Swann canvassed for votes among tailgating voters in Philadelphia before the Steelers game against the Eagles. Polls in early February showed Swann and Rendell in a statistical tie.\n\nHowever, Swann's momentum did not survive an effective barrage of advertising from Rendell in early spring and had trouble keeping up with Rendell's effective fundraising. Swann's focus on \"reforming\" Harrisburg never caught traction, possibly as a result of his vocal support for Chip Brightbill and Robert Jubelirer, two legislative leaders who were defeated in the May 2006 primary election.\n\n\n"}

The improved service was due to go live in the December 2018 timetable change, but the units could not be cascaded from other lines at that time.\n\nThere was also two morning and return services a day to Walsall. These operated in the early morning from Monday to Friday only. They were operated as extensions of the Shrewsbury to Birmingham Line. This replaced the former Liverpool Lime Street service. However in December 2019, following problems with services and disruptions. The Walsall service was once again withdrawn. Replaced by a through Rugeley Trent Valley to Wolverhampton service.\n\nSince December 2014, Virgin Trains (now Avanti West Coast) have run two daily services between Shrewsbury and London Euston.\n\nAs of the May 2019 timetable change, West Midlands Trains operates an hourly service on this line on Sundays. This was previously run as a two-hourly service by Arriva Trains Wales. Virgin Trains services only operate one of their direct trains in each direction on Sundays.\n\nThe Coalbrookdale line, which served Ironbridge Power Station to the south of Telford near Ironbridge, joined the Wolverhampton–Shrewsbury line at Madeley Junction, which is between Telford Central and Shifnal stations. Coal trains ran by EWS up to 2012 and by Fastline up to 2010 used the route, supplying the power station. Between 2012 and 2015, the power station was converted to run on biomass which was supplied mostly via Liverpool Docks by GBRf trains until closure of the plant in November 2015.\n\nIn 2008 the former Wellington to Stafford line was rebuilt as far as Donnington, for freight use. Telford International Railfreight Park is located at a site just off the Hortonwood Roundabout near Donnington which opened in 2009. The reopened line is single track and runs for from the junction with the Wolverhampton–Shrewsbury line at Wellington ( east of Wellington station). Currently the only rail business to and from the site is Ministry of Defence traffic which runs down from Warrington so only uses a brief portion of the line between Shrewsbury and Wellington.\n\n\n"}

His time as a shooting guard with the Mavericks was rather unremarkable as he played scant minutes and was often relegated to sitting on the bench.\n\nEllis' fortunes changed dramatically after he found himself traded to the Seattle SuperSonics for Al Wood on July 23, 1986. His playing time increased significantly, and his regular season scoring average reflected this as it jumped from 7.1 points per game with the Mavericks to 24.9 points per game with the SuperSonics. Ellis' rise with the SuperSonics was recognized around the league, which awarded him the NBA Most Improved Player Award in 1987.\n\nEllis continued to star for the SuperSonics in the late 1980s, with his scoring average topping out at 27.5 point per game during the 1988–89 season. The 2,253 points he scored that season broke Spencer Haywood's franchise record of 2,251 and remained the SuperSonics/Thunder record until Kevin Durant broke it in 2009–10. Ellis was selected to the NBA All-Star Game during the same season, and scored 27 points for the West. In all, Ellis spent four and a half seasons with the SuperSonics before once again being traded, this time to the Milwaukee Bucks for Ricky Pierce. Ellis made four-point plays in a win against the Sacramento Kings on January 26, 1988, becoming the first player in NBA history to complete two four point plays in one game.\n\nWhile he was again a bench player with the Bucks, his minutes still remained relatively high and Ellis still made large contributions to the team with his scoring ability. Following the conclusion of the 91-92 season, he found himself traded to the San Antonio Spurs for Tracy Murray. As a member of the Spurs, Ellis once again found himself in the starting lineup playing slightly more minutes than he did as a Buck. Although his production largely remained the same, he was doing it much more efficiently, shooting nearly 50% from the field as opposed to 46% with Milwaukee.\n\nAfter signing with the Denver Nuggets, and then later in his career traded to the SuperSonics once again, the Orlando Magic (for whom he never played), again to the Bucks, and the Charlotte Hornets, he saw a more reduced playing role. The Hornets traded him to the Miami Heat after the 1999–2000 season; but was waived prior to the start of the next season.\n\nEllis played in 1,209 games and had career averages of 15.7 points per game, 3.5 rebounds per game, a .479 field goal percentage, and a .403 three point field goal percentage. He set the NBA record for most minutes played in a single game when he scored 53 points in 69 minutes (out of a possible 73) for the SuperSonics in a 155-154 quintuple-overtime loss to the Bucks on November 9, 1989. His 1,719 career made three-pointers ranked second in NBA history at the time of his retirement.\n\n"}

They have been having financial problems so he is grateful for the gift. He explores it with his friend Lothar Gelt (nicknamed Loaf) and their acquaintance Merle Stone, where they discover it is a piece of alien technology. Once turned on, it enables them to communicate with a stray dog around the base named \"Bitz\", who tells them he is actually code-named Sirius (a pun on the \"Dog Star\" of the same name). He and Merle's apparent cat (named Googie, code-name Vega), are both members of the \"Friends\", a group dedicated to resistance of The Tyrant, who leads the FOEs (Forces of Evil). Specifically, they are shape-shifters who have become permanently trapped in these Earth creature forms. They explain how The Tyrant has captured all of the servers in the Galaxy except for the one that Sirius and his companion Janus brought to Earth and disguised as the computer. The Server's \"Help\" program, which activates whenever its name is said, is sardonic and fails to live up to its name. Jack receives further proof of the truth of these odd revelations when he is teleported (called t-mailed) to meet Janus on another planet (teleportation through \"N-Space\" enables the characters to travel faster-than-light).\n\nLoaf exploits this and gallavants around the Galaxy (it is always capitalised in the series) irresponsibly enough for the FOEs to imprison some of the Earth resistance. Janus rescues them, but a Bug (an extraterrestrial resembling a rhinoceros, in The Tyrant's employ) follows them to Earth when Tracer, The Tyrant's right-hand man, sends a \"western\" virus into the Server. Merle fends it off with her chess skill and Loaf resists it with an arcade-style simulation, but when Jack is playing Battleship, Bitz leaps onto the keyboard, over-ruling Merle's advice, and hits the wrong button. This allows the Bug to arrive on Earth; however, Janus arrives shortly thereafter. In the battle that ensues, Janus and the Bug both fall into N-Space, presumably dead, Janus sacrificing himself for the Server's safety. A message to them sent on time-delay reveals them they can either remain safe on Earth for Friends agents to find them, or search for the enigmatic Weaver, founder of the Outernet.\n\nWith his personal agenda foremost, Loaf cons Jack into giving him The Server in an attempt to make money, which requires him to take out a loan from aliens. His greed causes the seemingly impregnable Chain protecting Earth from the FOEs to be broken, so the Tyrant sends another of the Bugs to get The Server back. As a result, Jack and his friends are stranded on Deadrock, a dangerous planet, crawling with FOEs, and Loaf runs into several representatives of the nastiest loan sharks in the Galaxy. Loaf owes them money and they'd like a word with him. Back on Earth, the Bug poses as an agent of the US government and gains control of Merle's father, Colonel Stone, commander of a USAF base in England. Jack and Merle find allies- but the Deadrock Freedom Fighters face terrible odds, and all they have on their side are primitive weapons and the cranky Help application. As revolution rages on Deadrock, Jack and his Friends return to Earth in an attempt to rescue Colonel Stone and keep The Server from the FOEs. They eventually destroy the Deadrock Server, which FOEs had set up to monitor all information passed through it electronically (speech was forbidden) and reintroduce the residents to talking. At the end, Janus contacts them from N-space and directs them to the planet Helios to meet Tiresias, the \"sightless one who sees all things\" (a reference to the Greek myth of Tiresias).\n\nFollowing Janus's instructions, Jack, Merle, Loaf, Bitz, and Googie attempt to teleport to Helios. However, they are intercepted and detained on a planet populated by spiders. Each time they attempt to leave, they are returned to their original location and time, with no memory of their original arrival. Eventually the Help program is able to break the vicious circle. This leads them to Googie's home planet, Kippo VI. She is arrested as a traitor, but the humans find themselves able to shapeshift due to parasitic natives of the planet that endow all residents or visitors with the ability. They fight off FOE attacks, helped by Loaf, who is being controlled by a chip that Tracer implanted in him.\n\nUnable to teleport to Helios, they look for affordable spaceship transportation and find it in the form of hippie Zodiac Hobo and his anonymous ship, which complains about its status as such until Merle names it \"Trigger\". They arrive safely and are accosted by the Collectors of Helios, a parody of Earth monks. They are led to the Sightless One, who promises to input the Weaver's coordinates if he is given the Server. He is revealed as Tracer, however. It's not long before the Friends find the true Tiresias, a monstrous life-form bound to a computer that collects knowledge but can do nothing with it. After meeting Janus in N-space (he removes Loaf from Tracer's control), they serve as eyes for Tiresias, letting him see the universe before dying in peace.\n\nAs the title might indicate, the third book of the series contains several allusions to the Odyssey of Homer. When Jack sees one-eyed extraterrestrial guards, he is reminded of Cyclops, and suggests disguising themselves, as Odysseus and his crew disguised themselves by hiding under sheep.\n\nThis is successful, and Jack and his friends eventually escape on \"Trigger\". Once in space, they hear a message claiming to be from a woman named Molpe, a refugee from the fictional planet of \"Ligeia\". After some debate, Jack orders the refugees' rescue, only to find that the humanoids have metamorphosed into dangerous asteroids. After escaping them, \"Trigger\" lands on what appears to be an asteroid. One of the characters, however, identifies it as a silla, a creature that traps spaceships. \"Trigger\" escapes this threat as well, only to fall into a black hole that parallels the mythological Charybdis.\n\nIn the first chapter of the book, the protagonists are involuntarily teleported to a planet occupied by arachnid extraterrestrials (and, indeed, named \"Arachnius III\"). A \"reverse Chain\" of teleportation allows them to be repeatedly teleported from the teleportation station where they arrive back to that same station, with no memory of the previous times they've arrived there. The Arachnians analyse the protagonists' saliva to produce food perfectly catered to their tastes: both of these facets allude to the mythological Lotophagi. At the end of the book, they are indeed successful in meeting Tiresias.\n\nJack, Merle, Loaf and their companions Googie and Bitz travel back in time to Vered II, homeworld of tree-dwelling computer genius Selenity Dreeb, a member of a group of computer fanatics called the Weavers. Merle attempts to return to her own time, but winds up in an alternate universe in which the Outernet was never created: Tracer is invading Earth, and she is a rebel on the opposite side of the war from Jack. Lothar, Loaf's alternative self, tells her that the alternate version of her was killed but that they had had a relationship. She brings him back with her to Selenity's time, where Jack gives Selenity the information needed to start the Outernet. A jealous Loaf leaves the alternate Lothar behind when they try to return to Earth, but in that timeline Janus and Sirius/Bitz were captured by FOEs on Vered. They go to a recent version of Vered and wind up having to create three copies of themselves to allow Janus and Sirius to escape. It is revealed that Help was previously helpful, but months of being carried across the countryside by Bitz corrupted his memory. When they return to Earth, the time-traveling capability is disabled.\n\nThe Tyrant has retired the Bugs for their repeated failures and recruited Bounty Hunters, the ruthless, self-serving scum of the universe. Their task is to hunt down The Server along with Jack and his Friends. Mad Moxie, the Thing With No Name and Tingkat Bumbag (the most feared Hunter in the Galaxy) are bad enough, but when The Tyrant's renegade ex-Communications Chief and Zodiac Hobo, space adventurer extraordinaire (not forgetting Zodiac's ship Trigger) lend a hand (or in Tracer's case, six hands), things get seriously out of hand. What follows is a roller-coaster ride around the Earth as Jack and his companions try to stay one step ahead of the Bounty Hunters and activate the planet's ancient defences against alien invasion. They use a low-tech form of teleportation, travelling to Stonehenge (where Janus and Sirius originally landed), the Great Pyramid of Giza, Machu Picchu, Uluru, and Shangri-La to complete a chain that will defend Earth. The Tyrant, however, takes advantage of their absence to capture Jack's parents.\n\nJack and his companions have foiled The Tyrant, leader of the FOEs and Most Evil Being in the Galaxy, time after time. However, the Tyrant has kidnapped Jack's parents. And now Merle, Loaf, Googie and Bitz have to help Jack take the fight to the Dread Lord himself, to the depths of the Dark Pyramid. The final struggle to save The Server, and with it the Outernet, the Pan-Galactic Web itself, is about to begin.\n\nJanus gives Help access to a startling secret: the Bugs, believed to be genetically engineered, were in fact a thriving species before The Tyrant annihilated all but one and cloned it. With this knowledge, the Bugs willingly come to Jack's side for the showdown. The Tyrant is revealed to be Lothar, who grew bitter on Vered. The Weaver turns out to be Tracer, who has contained Selenity's consciousness as well through a mind-meld. The Tyrant disappears into N-Space, and Tracer/Selenity/Weaver is physically killed but able to survive consciously through the Outernet. Jack takes on the title of Weaver but Loaf and Merle move to the U. S., promising to keep in touch with Jack through the Outernet.\n"}
{"id": "2094675", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2094675", "title": "The Public Enemy (professional wrestling)", "text": "The Public Enemy (professional wrestling)\n\nThe Public Enemy was a professional wrestling tag team consisting of Rocco Rock and Johnny Grunge. The duo competed in many promotions, including Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), World Championship Wrestling (WCW), National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), and the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). They won the World Tag Team Championships in each company except WWF.\n\nTheir name was taken from a black and white gangster film, and prior to becoming a team, Rocco Rock and Johnny Grunge had a long-standing feud on the independent circuit. In addition, the two wrestled each other under their former ring names the Cheetah Kid and Johnny Rotten in a dark match at the first TV tapings for \"WWF Monday Night Raw\" on January 11, 1993, eight months before they would debut as a tag team in ECW. In September 2002, Rocco Rock died after a heart attack. Johnny Grunge died almost four years later, in February 2006, from sleep apnea complications.\n\nThe Public Enemy made their ECW debut in September 1993 at \"UltraClash\", as booker Paul Heyman gave them the gimmick of white guys who embraced and loved the growing hip hop culture of America. Heyman has stated that he got the inspiration to create The Public Enemy from a \"Newsweek\" article about the cultural changes occurring in America and the difficulty for young men living in places like Los Angeles during the early 1990s, with a quote that stated \"The generation of today is more afraid of living than dying\".\n\nThe team quickly became one of the more popular acts in the company; their wild brawling style, complete with a myriad of foreign objects and the inclusion of tables, made them one of the most feared teams in the company and it wasn't long before they won their first ECW Tag Team Championship. They regularly danced their way to the ring, waving their arms to the their theme song (Ini Kamoze's \"Here Comes The Hotstepper\") and inviting fans into the ring for impromptu dance parties after won matches. As The Public Enemy was embraced by the majority of fans, Heyman was inspired to bring in The Gangstas (New Jack and Mustafa Saed, from Smoky Mountain Wrestling) to feud with TPE. The Gangstas immediately began a long and bloody feud with The Public Enemy, which pitted The Gangstas' \"harsh, gritty West Coast gangsta\" lifestyle against The Public Enemy's \"East Coast feel good\" style. Their feud is among the feuds most often cited as \"classic ECW\".\n\nThe Public Enemy was also involved in some of ECW's most memorable moments. On one occasion, during a singles match between Cactus Jack and Terry Funk at Hardcore Heaven 1994, the Public Enemy interfered and attacked both wrestlers. Terry Funk turned to the crowd and asked the fans if he could have a chair to use. A fan immediately threw a chair into the ring, and not long after many other fans followed suit. Eventually the ring was filled with chairs with both members of The Public Enemy buried underneath.\n\nIn another incident in Tampa, Florida, towards the end of their run with ECW, during the Sunshine State Slaughter event in 1995, The Public Enemy asked the fans to come into the ring to dance with them one last time. As more and more fans piled in and onto the ring, all dancing and celebrating, the ring actually collapsed.\n\nAt ECW's House Party 1999 on January 16, The Public Enemy made a long-awaited and much-hyped return to the ECW Arena, in order to answer the challenge of the Dudley Boyz. At the time, they were still under contract to WCW, but they successfully brawled (with assistance from New Jack) with the Dudleys. Following the showdown, Johnny Grunge grabbed the microphone and claimed that the past three years had been a \"rollercoaster ride\" for the team, and that \"if you opened up our chest and looked at our hearts, there's only one thing stamped on it, and that's ECW!\" Grunge further thanked the Dudleys for house-sitting \"the house that the Public Enemy built\" while they were gone, and then invited everyone in attendance to join them in the ring for a post-show celebration.\n\nOn November 19, 1995 The Public Enemy received a tryout with the WWF, wrestling a dark match against then WWF Tag-Team Champions The Smokin' Gunns. The team would receive an offer to sign with the company, but instead elected to go with a competing overture from World Championship Wrestling. In January 1996, after their success in ECW, The Public Enemy signed on to work for World Championship Wrestling (WCW). When they arrived in WCW, they continued acting as they did in the manner that made them so popular with fans. Although the majority of the WCW fanbase was unfamiliar with the ECW product at the time, they still carried tables to the ring. During their three-year stint, they won their only WCW World Tag Team Championship with a victory over Harlem Heat in September 1996, though their reign lasted only eight days. The team wrestled through September 1998 and was mostly victorious in their final year with the company, concluding their run with a win over Villanos IV and V on a Worldwide episode.\n\nThe Public Enemy made a brief return to ECW at the House Party '99 show on January 16, 1999, battling the Dudley Boys to a double countout. Their next scheduled appearance was at Crossing the Line '99 on February 12 in Queens, New York against the Dudleys, which they cancelled due to negotiating with the WWF. The team was buried on the February 20 edition of ECW \"Hardcore TV\" as being cowards who ran from a fight. Footage of the Dudleys hitting big moves on the team at an event in Detroit was shown, with a headline stating \"Breaking News: The Dudleys Destroy Public Enemy.\" Two days later, the team would make their WWF debut.\n\nThe Public Enemy signed with the World Wrestling Federation in early 1999. They were not accepted \"backstage\" by veteran WWF wrestlers and backstage personnel due to animosity over the fact that The Public Enemy chose WCW over the WWF when the two companies were pursuing the tag team in late 1995. Rocco Rock was also forced to change his name and go by the shortened name \"Flyboy\" Rocco, in order not to \"cause confusion\" with The Rock. They made their WWF debut on the February 22, 1999, episode of \"Raw is War\", defeating The Brood by disqualification. In the two months they lasted in the WWF, their most notable appearance was losing a squash match against the Acolytes on \"Sunday Night Heat\" in Pittsburgh; following a brief feud with APA and The Public Enemy's subsequent release, the APA claimed that they \"ran The Public Enemy out\" of the WWF. They said they could do the same to another famous ECW tag team (the Dudley Boyz); after the Dudley Boyz succeeded in the feud, it was commonly referred to as \"Passing the Acolyte Test\" since the Dudley Boyz did get over after a feud with the APA while The Public Enemy failed. In 2013, John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield elaborated that much of the animosity was due to them being brought into the company by Terry Taylor, who had his own backstage issues with much of the wrestlers, including the Acolytes. They had also desired to change the planned finish of the squash match, which involved them being driven through tables by the Acolytes. The Acolytes were instructed only to ensure that they go through with the planned finish of the match, leading to the match to be turned into a legitimate shoot. Public Enemy would wrestle a final time on March 30, 1999 in a match taped for \"Shotgun Saturday Night\", losing to the Hardy Boys via disqualification. The match was aired on television on April 10, 1999. Shortly after airing, both members of Public Enemy were released in mid-April, along with \"Dr Death.\" Steve Williams (who main-evented that same episode), Bart Gunn, and LOD 2000.\n\nThe Public Enemy briefly returned to WCW after leaving the WWF, with both men involved in the WCW Hardcore Junkyard Invitational. They then made an appearance on the August 4, 1999, episode of \"WCW Thunder\" in a squash match loss against Bill Goldberg and again on August 9 in a losing effort against the West Texas Rednecks. Their final appearance came in a house show on August 18, and neither made an appearance in WCW again afterwards.\n\nThe Public Enemy made one last appearance on \"ECW on TNN\", which was their last exposure on mainstream television. The tag team made brief appearances on the independent scene after both WCW and ECW folded, appearing in ECW-nostalgia promotion Pro-Pain Pro Wrestling (3PW), along with various NWA territories. They also participated in the unaired tapings for the X Wrestling Federation promotion, under the name \"South Philly Posse\" and managed by Jasmin St. Claire.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the Public Enemy performed for the short-lived i-Generation Superstars of Wrestling among other independent promotions. The team won various independent tag team titles.\n\nTheir last match together was at Intergalactic Wrestling Federation defeating Itch Coma Weidler and The Bouncer in a steel cage match at the Illinois State Fair in Springfield, IL on August 12, 2002.\n\nFollowing the death of Rocco Rock in 2002, Grunge teamed with his \"brother\" Joey Grunge as The New Public Enemy throughout August 2003. He also made appearances with 3PW, and participated in a memorial segment for deceased ECW wrestlers at \"Hardcore Homecoming\" on June 10, 2005.\n\nOn September 21, 2002, Ted Petty (\"Flyboy\" Rocco Rock) died after suffering a heart attack following a wrestling event. Johnny Grunge had been semi-retired for a few years after the XWF failed to get a TV deal. On February 16, 2006, Mike Durham (Johnny Grunge) died in his home after suffering from complications from sleep apnea. Durham's death was caused by heart disease and obesity, with the medical examiner also citing \"acute toxicity of carisoprodol and hydrocodone\" in the autopsy report. Durham evidently died in his sleep at the home of a friend with whom he'd been staying.\n\nDurham's widow has since become an advocate against drug abuse in the wrestling industry since the Chris Benoit double murder and suicide in 2007, when she realized her husband's prescriptions came from the same doctor as Chris Benoit's.\n\n\n\n"}

Person played 14 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and was the 1987 NBA Rookie of the Year. Person played college basketball at Auburn University and was selected fourth overall in the 1986 NBA draft by the Indiana Pacers, for whom he played six seasons. He also played for the Minnesota Timberwolves, San Antonio Spurs, Charlotte Hornets and Seattle SuperSonics. His 17-year coaching career ended when Person was ensnared in a college recruitment scandal and pleaded guilty to a bribery charge.\n\nBorn in Brantley, Alabama, Person was named after NBA player, MLB player, and actor Chuck Connors. He attended Brantley High School in Brantley, Alabama and played college basketball at Auburn University. He was the most prolific scorer in Auburn basketball history. Person was a four-year letter winner at Auburn from 1982 to 1986, helping the team to Auburn's first three NCAA Tournament appearances (1984–1986), including a trip to the Elite Eight in 1986. He also helped Auburn win the 1985 SEC Tournament, for which he was named Tournament MVP as Auburn was the first league school to win four tournament games in four days.\n\nPerson, who played alongside fellow Auburn greats Charles Barkley and Chris Morris, is the all-time scoring leader in Auburn history, with 2,311 points in 126 games for an 18.3 ppg mark, which is sixth all time in school history. He is also the school record-holder for field goals made (1,017) and field goals attempted (1,899) and is third in total rebounds (940).\n\nPerson was a two-time All-American (1985, 1986), a three-time First Team All-SEC selection and was selected to ESPN's SEC Silver Anniversary Team. Nicknamed \"The Rifleman\", he had his No. 45 jersey retired at Auburn on February 18, 2006. \nAuburn upset No. 1 ranked St. John's University on its way to an Elite Eight appearance.\n\nPerson was selected fourth in the 1986 NBA draft by the Indiana Pacers; the small forward won the Rookie of the Year award in 1987 and played six seasons with Indiana. Person averaged a career high 21.6 points in 1988. During his NBA playing years he was known as \"The Rifleman\" due to his 3-point shooting ability and the fact that he was named after Chuck Connors, star of the TV series \"The Rifleman\". Person was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves, along with Micheal Williams, in a deal that sent Sam Mitchell and Pooh Richardson to Indiana in 1993.\n\nPerson played only two seasons with the Timberwolves. He averaged a career low 11.6 points in 1993.\n\nPerson played for the San Antonio Spurs from 1994 through 1998. His \"Rifleman\" nickname remained apt, as he not only set the NBA season record for three-pointers by a reserve player, with 164 during the 1994–95 season (lasting until the 2015–16 season by Mirza Teletović of the Phoenix Suns), but he also set the Spurs' season record for three-pointers at 190 made during the 1995–96 season (a record that stood until Danny Green surpassed it during the 2014–2015 season). Person missed the entire 1996–97 season due to injury.\n\nPerson played with the Charlotte Hornets (1999) and Seattle SuperSonics before retiring from the NBA in 2000.\n\nAfter Person was traded by Seattle to the Lakers, who waived him (though he had already decided to retire) in 2000, he joined Cleveland Cavaliers head coach John Lucas's staff as an assistant for the 2000–01 NBA season.\n\nHe was then a player-relations assistant and scout to president Donnie Walsh in the Pacers' front office from January 2003 until July 2005, when he moved to an assistant-coaching position within the organization. In 2007, he interviewed unsuccessfully for both the Pacers' and the Sacramento Kings' vacant head-coaching positions.\n\nPerson became an assistant coach for Sacramento in 2007, but he left the Kings after head coach Reggie Theus was fired in mid-December 2008.\n\nAfter his first season with the Kings, Person was interviewed for the Chicago Bulls' head-coaching vacancy but ultimately was not hired.\n\nUpon leaving Sacramento, Person returned to his home town of Brantley, Alabama in 2008 for an eight-month break after 23 years of playing, administrating, and coaching.\n\nHe was invited to be Los Angeles Lakers coach Phil Jackson's assistant in 2009. In March 2010, he interviewed for the head coaching job for the men's team at his alma mater, Auburn University, but was not successful, despite positive feedback. He returned to his job with the Lakers after the interview. Lakers head coach Mike D'Antoni took over from Mike Brown in the middle of the 2012–13 season, and kept all of Brown's assistants, including Person. However, Person was fired after the season; he was the last remaining member from Jackson's Lakers staff.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, Person joined the coaching staff as an associate head coach in South Korea for the Jeonju KCC Egis in the Korean Basketball League.\n\nOn April 7, 2014, Auburn head coach Bruce Pearl hired Person as an assistant coach. He was promoted to associate head coach in May 2015 and was one of the top assistant coaches and recruiters in the nation before his arrest and subsequent release in September 2017 as part of the 2017–18 NCAA Division I men's basketball corruption scandal.\n\nHe is the older brother of former NBA player Wesley Person.\nHe was married to Carmen Person. He is the father of two daughters, Millicent and Tiffany and one son, Chuck Jr.\n\nPerson was arrested by federal law enforcement on the night of September 25, 2017 in Alabama. He was arrested on six felony counts: bribery conspiracy, solicitation of bribes and gratuities, conspiracy to commit honest services fraud, honest services wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and travel act conspiracy after allegedly accepting kickbacks for steering student-athletes to financial managers. Person was suspended without pay by Auburn University the day after his arrest.\n\nIn Manhattan on September 26, 2017, the acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York Joon H. Kim announced the arrest of Emanuel Richardson for federal bribery, fraud, and other corruption charges. Kim stated that, (federal authorities) had been investigating \"the criminal influence of money on coaches and student-athletes who participate in intercollegiate basketball governed by the N.C.A.A.\" Besides Arizona, the Division I universities of Auburn, Oklahoma State, and U.S.C., as well as a senior executive at sportswear manufacturer Adidas, were also implicated. In addition to the alleged bribes taken by assistant coaches, some unnamed student-athletes' families also accepted money. The indictments describe wire fraud and money laundering where collegiate students were enticed to commit during college to work with specific agents and companies after they turned professional (NBA), or to convince coveted high-schoolers to attend specific universities.\n\nThree separate indictments were filed.\n\n(1) Chuck Person was arrested.\n\n(2) Case number 17-MAG-7119 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York is a sealed criminal complaint against Richardson, Lamont Evans (associate head basketball coach at Oklahoma State University), Anthony Bland (an assistant basketball coach at the University of Southern California), Christian Dawkins (an athletes' agent), and Munish Sood (CEO of Princeton Advisory Group).\n\n(3) Adidas employee James Gatto and others (including Dawkins and Sood) were named as defendants in a separate complaint released the same day.\n\nPerson was indicted by a federal grand jury and subsequently fired by Auburn University on November 7, 2017. Person pled guilty to a single count of conspiracy to commit bribery on March 19, 2019, with sentencing pending. Person agreed to forfeit $91,500 as a condition of the plea.\n\n"}

{"id": "2094693", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2094693", "title": "Ann &amp; Hope", "text": "Ann &amp; Hope\n\nAnn & Hope is a Rhode Island–based retailer that pioneered practices now common in modern big box stores. The company was named after the ship \"Ann and Hope\" which was lost at sea off Block Island, Rhode Island in 1806. They operated from 1953 to 2001 in the Northeastern United States, and they currently operate a small chain of home fashion outlets, garden outlets, and dollar outlets in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Connecticut.\n\nAnn & Hope was founded by Martin Chase, who was born in 1906 in Kiev, Russian Empire (modern-day Ukraine), and moved with his family to Providence, Rhode Island, at age six. He was the only one of six sons not to work in his father's automobile repair business. Instead, when he was 20, he got a job working at a store called Fintex. After Fintex closed its doors in 1929, Chase worked at Howard's Clothes until 1933. Then he started Chase Clothing, where he undersold other area clothing stores by reducing overhead: for example he did not offer alterations and used inexpensive store fixtures.\nAs World War II approached, the clothing market fell into decline, and Chase began to look for another line of work. In 1946, he purchased the Ann & Hope Mill complex in the village of Lonsdale in Cumberland, Rhode Island. He split the large, empty mill into several small pieces and rented them individually.\n\nSome time before December 1953, one of the tenants left the Mill, leaving a large amount of ribbon behind. Rather than dispose of it, the Chases opened the area to the other employees of the Mill and sold the ribbon. Chase then had the idea to reopen a clothing store in the Mill, initially on the third floor. By the following spring, the operation had become large enough that it was relocated to the ground floor. Over time more products were added, and by 1969, Ann & Hope was a $40 million per year operation.\n\nAnn & Hope was one of the first self-service department stores, in which customers could look at items without sales personnel, and was also part of the first wave of retail stores in the 1950s to use big basket shopping carts. The original mill location also featured a large parking area, which was not common at the time, as well as a basement level with even more merchandise. A special shopping cart conveyor was operated by staff to move store patrons' items from one floor to the other. Other now-familiar features such as having a central checkout area and a liberal store return policy were also pioneered by Ann & Hope.\n\nAnn & Hope also had several features now common to big-box retail facilities. For example, some Ann & Hope stores had full-scale cafeterias. When originally constructed, Ann & Hope stores also had an area that was rented to a sub-tenant, with both in-store and outside entrances, a variation of which is a relatively recent introduction in larger Wal-Mart stores. Many Ann & Hope locations had limited success renting to tenants, and before the chain's closing in 2001, many had been converted to store-run garden shops.\n\nSam Walton, founder of Wal-Mart, visited the Ann & Hope chain in 1961 and got the idea for his store from it, and Harry Cunningham visited Ann & Hope in the process of preparing to launch the first Kmart store.\n\nFollowing a slow 1989–90 holiday season, the Seekonk, Massachusetts store experienced lay-offs, most notably in the home-wares and rug and blind departments. These layoffs were viewed by some as a portent of the difficulties that the Seekonk store (as well as her sister A&H stores) would experience in a cut-throat regional market throughout the 1990s. All of the Ann & Hope department stores closed in the spring of 2001, except for the two Rhode Island stores: the original location in Cumberland and the store in Warwick. High-value properties that Ann & Hope owned in Massachusetts were sold off. The two locations that remained open were downsized significantly and turned into off-price \"outlet stores.\" In the years following the closing, new Ann & Hope–branded outlet stores, such as the Ann & Hope Curtain & Bath Outlet, were opened. Several of these new Ann & Hope outlet stores occupied space near where Ann & Hope department stores had previously existed.\n\nAs of 2007, the original Cumberland property is home to an Ann & Hope Curtain and Bath Outlet and an outdoor Garden Outlet. In August 2007, the owners of Ann & Hope made public their intention to convert the Cumberland mill store to a \"mixed use\" development of retail and residential space. \n\nThe Cumberland mill building is now home to the Bargain City Galleria - a thriving flea market, food court and auction center.\n\nAs of 2010 Ann & Hope Curtain & Bath is still going strong, opening stores in Vernon and Newington, Connecticut.\n\nIn April and May 2011, Ann & Hope opened two new stores in Raynham and Weymouth, Massachusetts, buying out two Curtain Factory Outlet retailers. This makes a current total of 11 Ann & Hope Outlet Stores: two in Rhode Island, two in Connecticut, and seven in Massachusetts.\n\nIn May 2013, Ann & Hope continued to grow with its newest Curtain & Bath Outlet location opening in Westborough, MA. \n\nAfter a brief closure early in Spring 2020 due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, several Ann & Hope/Curtain & Bath Outlet Garden Outlets reopened on April 27, 2020. The Curtain & Bath Outlet Facebook page reported: \n\n\"Our garden outlet locations will be OPEN Starting Monday, April 27th! Open daily 8:30am to 5pm! Fully stocked with annuals, perennials, vegetables, herbs, fertilizer, soils, tools, and so much more! Our Cumberland, Warwick, Seekonk & Millis garden outlet locations will be open. Danvers location will open soon.\nCurtain & Bath outlets will not be open. Please be safe and practice social distancing while shopping.\" \n\nThe reopening of outdoor shopping areas - including garden products and patio - was made possible in part by New England governors partially reopening some businesses to the public during the COVID-19 Pandemic. This included Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo's response to constituents who expressed a desire that small garden shops be reopened. Governor Raimondo stated at a press conference on April 18, 2020, \"I've heard you. I'm hearing you and I want you to know that I directed [the Department of Business Regulation] to work with [the Department of Environmental Management] to address this issue and figure out a safe way for you all to open your businesses.\" Interior shopping areas remained temporarily closed as of late April 2020. This step was taken in keeping with statewide policies on social distancing, and the designation of critical and non-critical retailers during the pandemic.\n\n"}

The club was founded in 1880, mainly with gymnastics but also fencing as the main sports. However AGF is best known for its football team, which was introduced in 1902.\n\nAGF has won 5 Danish Football Championships and a record 9 Danish Cups. In 1961 AGF reached the quarterfinal of the European Cup. In 1989 AGF again reached a European quarterfinal this time in the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup.\n\nAGF played its first football match against Aarhus Idrætsklub Olympia in November 1902, a 5–2 loss. Six years later, the club won the Jutland Football Championship by winning 3–2 over Ringkøbing in the final. AGF won the Jutland Football Championship seven times and was in three finals of the Danish Football Championship before AGF became a member of the newly founded Denmark Tournament in 1927.\n\nIn 1911, AGF got its own clubhouse then the club brought the pitches at Dalgas Avenue. In 1920, AGF began to play its home matches at the newly build Aarhus Stadion, where the club has played ever since. In 1941, the club moved from the clubhouse at Dalgas Avenue to Fredensvang in the suburb Viby.\nFor three seasons in a row from 1949–51 AGF finished in third place in the top division. After spending the 1952–53 season in the 2. division, AGF returned strongly to the 1. division and in the next 12 seasons won four Danish Football Championships and five Danish Cups. AGF also participated in the first edition of the European Cup, where it lost to French club Stade de Reims. In 1961, AGF reached the quarter-final in the same tournament where it lost to eventual tournament winners Benfica. AGF was relegated to the 2. division in 1968 and in 1973 but returned to the 1. division in 1976. This was the start of 30 years in the top division.\n\nThe introduction of professional football in Denmark had a big influence on the success AGF experienced from the late 1970s and forward until 1998. With the former Real Madrid star Henning Jensen on the team was AGF close at winning the Danish Football Championship in 1982. AGF played 2–2 against B 93 in the last game of the season sending the championship to Odense Boldklub. In 1984 AGF was again close to clinching the championship but lost it by a single point to the rivals from Vejle Boldklub. Finally in 1986 AGF won its fifth Danish Football Championship. Flemming Povlsen, Jan Bartram and John Stampe was the profiles in the team. In 1987, 1988 and 1992 AGF also won the Danish Cup.\n\nIn 1996, with players like Stig Tøfting and Håvard Flo, was AGF again close at winning the Danish Football Championship but AGF was overtaken by Brøndby IF in the second last round of the tournament. AGF got revenge by winning the final of the Danish Cup against Brøndby IF in the same season.\n\nIn 1998, AGF finished third in the Danish Superliga but financial problems resulted in some poor results the following years. In 2000, Peter Rudbæk was fired after seven years as manager. From 2000 onwards, the club experienced some of its worst ever results, which led to relegations in the 2005–06, 2009–10 and 2013–14 season. Each time, however, the club secured a quick return to the top-flight.\n\nIn the summer of 2014, AGF appointed Jacob Nielsen as its new director. Nielsen had been successful as director of Randers where he had managed to secure fine economic results. AGF also hired a new sporting director and Morten Wieghorst as manager. On 6 December 2015, however, Nielsen announced that Wieghorst was fired and that former Danish champion Glen Riddersholm was hired as his replacement.\n\nWith Glen Riddersholm as manager AGF finished the 2015–16 season in tenth place having won 3 games, drawn 7, and lost 5 in the remainder of the season. AGF qualified for 2016 cup final losing 2–1 to FC Copenhagen. In the 2016–17 season AGF finished 11th after having played relegation play-off matches in the new league structure introduced that season.\n\nOn 30 September 2017 Riddersholm was fired due to inconsistent results. At that point AGF was 7th in the league having started the 2017–18 season with 4 wins, 5 defeats, and 2 draws. Riddersholm's last match was a 5–1 win against FC Helsingør. New manager was David Nielsen who started with 4 consecutive league defeats but finished the season in 7th place after losing a European play-off final against FC Copenhagen 4–1.\n\nTheir home ground is Ceres Park which has a capacity of 19,433.\n\n\nSources:\n\n\n12 – AGF Fanclub Aarhus\n\n\nSince 1927, AGF has played 68 seasons at the highest level in Danish football, which is a record.\n\n\nAGF's first competitive European match was on September 21, 1955, in the 1955-56 European Cup, dropping a 0–2 decision to France's Stade Reims, eventually losing on aggregate 2–4 in the first round. Since then, the club has participated in numerous UEFA competitions, advancing as far as the quarter-finals of the 1960-61 European Cup and 1988-89 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup.\n\n"}

It was launched from Cape Canaveral on a Delta-C1 rocket, on May 25, 1966. It was the second of five Atmosphere Explorers, the first being Explorer 17.\n\nExplorer 32 was a stainless steel, vacuum-sealed sphere, in diameter. It carried one ion and two neutral mass spectrometers, three magnetron density gauges, and two electrostatic probes. It used a tape recorder to save data that was acquired when the satellite was not in range of one of the 13 ground stations. It was powered by silver-zinc batteries and a solar cell array.\n\nThe satellite had an operational life of 10 months. The two neutral mass spectrometers failed a few days after launch, but the remaining instruments operated throughout most of the satellite's lifetime. Explorer 32 suffered a depressurization which led to battery failure, at which point it ceased functioning.\n\nExplorer 32 was designed to directly measure the temperature, composition, density, and pressure of the upper atmosphere.\n\nThe \"ion mass spectrometers\" measured the concentrations of different types of ions in the topside ionosphere, principally atomic hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, and oxygen. The concentrations were recorded as a function of time, location, and solar and geomagnetic activity. The satellite was able to perform a global study of the diurnal variation of the atmosphere during nearly two complete diurnal cycles, since the orbit plane precessed one revolution each 5.5 months. The data from the ion mass spectrometers allowed for studies of: (1) the diurnal and seasonal variation of atmospheric ion composition, (2) the effect of atmospheric winds on the atomic hydrogen-atomic oxygen ion transition level, (3) the density and temporal variation of thermospheric atomic hydrogen, and (4) the altitude variation of ion composition in the midlatitude trough region.\n\nThe three \"magnetron density gauges\" measured the density of the neutral atmosphere as a function of altitude, time, latitude, and solar and geomagnetic activity.\n\nThe \"electron temperature and density\" instrument measure the distribution of electron temperatures and densities using a swept voltage electron probe.\n\nThe two \"neutral particle magnetic mass spectrometers\" were intended to measure the composition of the neutral atmosphere at altitudes between . One spectrometer failed after 4 days, and the other failed after 7 days in orbit.\n\nThe \"satellite drag atmospheric density\" experiment measured the density of the upper atmosphere as a function of altitude, latitude, season, and solar activity. The experiment was possible due to the symmetrical shape of Explorer 32. When the satellite was near perigee, it was observed by networks of ground-based Baker-Nunn cameras, as well as being tracked by radio and radar. Sequences of these observations were used to deduce the density of the atmosphere that the satellite was passing through.\n\n\n"}

Moore played college basketball for The University of Texas at Austin under head coaches Leon Black and Abe Lemons from 1975 to 1979. He spent his entire NBA career playing point guard for the San Antonio Spurs, save one game for the New Jersey Nets. A rare illness caused Moore to have his career put on hold in early 1986.\n\nMoore started all 112 games of his four-year college career at Texas. He finished his career as Texas' all-time career assists leader, with 714, and remains second all-time in assists per game, averaging 6.38 assists over the course of his four years as the Longhorns' point guard. His per-game average of 8.34 assists as a senior remains a UT men's basketball record. Moore also posted a double-figure scoring average in each of his four seasons.

Shortly after graduating, she was hired at the Kihara Institute for Biological Research where she focused on the cytogenetics of wheat and sugar beets. In 1962 an opportunity provided by Hitoshi Kihara to study abroad in the U.S. became available. While a graduate student at the Graduate School of North Carolina State University, she switched her graduate study focus from plant cytogenetics to population genetics. She then was able to assist her advisor, Ken-Ichi Kojima, in working on problems in stochastic population genetics where they took into account the random changes of allelic frequencies. She obtained her Ph.D. from North Carolina State University in 1966. Because she had studied abroad as a Fulbright student, she was only able to stay in the United States to finish her PhD.\n\nReturning to Japan, Ohta worked under Motoo Kimura, who was the only theoretical population geneticist in Japan at the time. After working on the neutral theory of evolution with her mentor Kimura, she became convinced that nearly neutral mutations (neither deleterious nor entirely neutral) played an important role in evolution. She developed the slightly damaging model (Ohta, 1973), then a more general form, the nearly neutral theory of evolution. She worked at the Japanese National Institute of Genetics from 1969 to 1996, and, in 2002, she was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences as a foreign associate in evolutionary biology.\n\nShe was married to Yasuo Ohta from 1960 to 1972, and has one child.\n\nWhen Ohta first published her Nearly Neutral theory, she faced difficulty in attracting the scientific research community's attention. Many researchers at the time strongly supported the natural selection theory. Supporting data in protein evolution was sequentially collected in the 1990s, with even more evidence supporting her theory made available throughout the 21st century. There is more and more evidence evolving that supports her nearly neutral theory of evolution. Some examples include: genetic code and the process that occurs during blood clotting.\n\n\n\n"}

It was Shane Douglas's answer to Ric Flair's Four Horsemen. Douglas disliked Flair since he felt that Flair had held him back during his first run in World Championship Wrestling (WCW), when Flair was one of the bookers in WCW at the time.\n\nThe original Triple Threat consisted of Shane Douglas, Chris Benoit and Dean Malenko in ECW. At one point they dominated ECW, as Douglas was ECW World Heavyweight Champion, and Benoit and Malenko were ECW World Tag Team Champions. Malenko also became a two-time ECW World Television Champion. The group developed a hand signal – the three outer fingers raised with palms facing outward.\n\nDuring the summer of 1995, Douglas left for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), thus disbanding the Triple Threat. However, for a brief time 2 Cold Scorpio was added as a member of the Triple Threat (at least one episode of \"ECW Hardcore TV\" had Scorpio, Benoit, and Malenko cutting a promo together stating they were the Triple Threat).\n\nNevertheless, when Benoit and Malenko left for WCW, the Triple Threat ceased to exist until Douglas returned to ECW. During their time in WCW, Benoit and Malenko were both members of the prominent Four Horsemen stable and often teamed together.\n\nIn late 1996, approximately a year after his return to ECW, Douglas reformed the stable with Chris Candido and the man for hire \"Bulldozer\" Brian Lee, and Francine as their manager. Douglas held the ECW World Television Championship, but sought to regain the ECW World Heavyweight Championship. In early 1997, a masked man (who displayed the mannerisms of Rick Rude) began stalking Francine. At ECW's first pay-per-view event Barely Legal, the man was revealed to be Brian Lee, who was kicked out of the Triple Threat for betraying Douglas.\n\nBam Bam Bigelow joined the group shortly after when Douglas introduced him as his tag team partner for a match at an event titled \"Chapter 2\". Douglas lost the ECW World Television Championship to Tazz, but won the ECW World Heavyweight Championship at Hardcore Heaven. Rick Rude eventually was persuaded by Shane Douglas to align with the Triple Threat. Rude promoted Chris Candido in his match against Tazz at Hardcore Heaven 1997. Rude then began selecting Douglas's opponent to help Douglas become the greatest world champion in ECW. However, this turned out to be a ruse when Rude selected Triple Threat member Bam Bam Bigelow as Douglas's next opponent. Bigelow then challenged Douglas for the title and won, but forfeited his membership in the group in the process. Lance Storm took his place, but it was short-lived,despite being tag team champions, Storm and Candido did not get along thus, Storm was kicked out. In January 1998, Bigelow was re-admitted to the group by helping Douglas defeat Tazz.\n\nTazz began a protracted feud with the entire stable, as he wanted a shot at Douglas's world title, but was repeatedly denied and instead being forced to wrestle matches against the other members of The Triple Threat. His frustration led to his creation of the Fuck The World Heavyweight Championship in defiance.\n\nAnother angle had Candido and Storm winning the ECW World Tag Team Championship together, and were forced to defend it despite their hatred for one another. During their reluctant title defenses, each man tried to one-up the other, and showed more concern for retaining the championship than for their partner's well-being.\n\nFor a brief time in 1998, once again every member of the group had an ECW title, with Douglas holding the ECW World Heavyweight Championship, Bigelow holding the ECW World Television Championship, and Candido holding one half of the ECW World Tag Team Championship with Triple Threat prospect Lance Storm. The group disbanded completely after Bigelow left for WCW, and Candido and Douglas went their separate ways after Douglas lost the ECW World Heavyweight Championship to Tazz at Guilty as Charged.\n\nIn late 1998, Rob Van Dam, Sabu and Taz teamed up to form The New Triple Threat. They wrestled Douglas, Candido and Bigelow at November to Remember on November 1, 1998 and were able to defeat them. The New Triple Threat then disbanded due to inner dissension.\n\nIn 1999, the three original members again teamed up, joining forces with Perry Saturn and Asya to form the group The Revolution.\n\nIn 2000, Douglas, Candido and Bigelow were briefly reunited in a group together in WCW. Despite not using the name Triple Threat, they imitated the mannerisms of the group. The group was disbanded shortly after, when Candido left WCW.\n\nIn 2002, the Triple Threat reunited as Douglas, Lizzie Borden and Supreme, and went by the name The Irish Guys and Gals. The three dominated the single's division in Xtreme Pro Wrestling (XPW), with Douglas holding the XPW World Heavyweight Championship and Supreme holding the XPW King of the Deathmatch Championship. Douglas would feud with Candido in XPW until XPW folded in 2003.\n\nIn 2004, Douglas, Candido and Bigelow reunited at a Jersey All Pro Wrestling (JAPW) show just one year before Candido's death in 2005.\n\nThree members of the Triple Threat died in a three-year span from 2005–2007. First on April 28, 2005, Candido would die of a blood clot from foot surgery. Then on January 19, 2007, Bigelow would die of heart disease and an overdose of cocaine and Benzodiazetine. On June 25, Benoit killed himself after strangling his youngest son Daniel and his wife Nancy.\n\n\n\n"}

It is an aquatic plant native to Madagascar, popularly sold for use in aquariums. It is endangered in the wild.\n\nIt is an aquatic monocotyledonous perennial plant with tuberous rhizomes in diameter. The leaves are oblong, the leaf blade 15–55 cm long and from 5–16 cm broad, with a total leaf length including the petiole of up to . The leaves spread horizontally beneath the surface of the water, and are little more than a lattice-like skeletal network of veins with no tissue between. The flowers are produced on an erect spike up to long, protruding up to above the water surface. There seem to be several forms of this plant in cultivation, some large, some much smaller.\n\nThe tuberous roots are edible. It requires water temperatures of 15-26 °C and pH of 5-7.5, growing best in low light outdoors. The substrate should be rich in nutrients.\n\nIt is a speciality in botanical gardens all over the world. It was once in such high demand that it came close to extinction in its natural habitat in Madagascar.\n\n\"A. madagascariensis\" is often regarded as a difficult plant to cultivate. This is due to several factors: 1) it needs bright indoor light to thrive; this encourages the growth of algae on the lattice-like leaves; which is difficult to remove; 2) newly imported bulbs grow well in their first year, but often fail in their second year, apparently due to a lack of food storage in the bulbs (cause still unknown); 3) seeds may be produced, but often fail to germinate or thrive. Some enthusiasts recommend strong water movement and a high filtration rate for this plant.\n\n\n"}

Mauer (September 4, 1901 – December 20, 1978) was an American college basketball, baseball and football coach and multi-sport college athlete. During the course of his 36-year collegiate coaching career, Mauer was the head basketball coach at the University of Kentucky, Miami University (Ohio), the University of Tennessee, the U.S. Military Academy, and the University of Florida. John was the head coach of the Tennessee baseball team. John also served as the defensive backs coach for Tennessee under head coach General Robert Neyland. After coaching his college coaching career, John worked under Vince Lombardi scouting players for the Green Bay Packers. Mauer also scouted for the San Francisco 49ers, Atlanta Falcons, and New York Giants.\n\nMauer was born in 1901 at Aurora, Illinois. Both of his parents died by the time he was 13 years old, and he was raised by his older sister. With the financial assistance of a local businessman, he attended Batavia High School in Batavia, Illinois and was able to enroll in college.\n\nMauer attended the University of Illinois in Urbana, Illinois from 1922 to 1926, where he played for the Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball team. As a player, he was remembered for being one of the pioneers of one-handed shooting. While attending Illinois, his roommate was Illini football great Harold E. \"Red\" Grange. Mauer was named Outstanding Athlete and Scholar in the Big Ten Conference as a senior, and graduated from Illinois with a bachelor's degree in 1926.\n\nMauer was the head coach in football, basketball, and track at Batavia High School, from 1926 to 1927, after which he was the head coach of the Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team of the University of Kentucky in Lexington, Kentucky from 1927 to 1930, immediately preceding the legendary Adolph Rupp. Mauer's successful Wildcats teams were known as the \"Mauer men,\" and he was one of the first coaches to popularize the bounce pass as an element of basketball offense. His Wildcats teams posted an overall win-loss record of 40–14 (.741) in three seasons.\n\nAfter leaving Kentucky, he became the head coach of the Miami Redskins men's basketball team of Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, coaching the Redskins (now known as the \"RedHawks\") for eight seasons from 1930 to 1938. Mauer did not have a winning record in his first five seasons with the Redskins, but posted winning records in two of his final three seasons. During the 1937–1938 season, the Redskins finished 11–5. At Miami, he coached Walter \"Smoky\" Alston who would go on manage the Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers. He finished his Miami career with an overall record of 46–80 (.365), leaving Oxford after the 1937–1938 season, and was replaced by Weeb Ewbank.\n\nMauer became the head coach for the Tennessee Volunteers men's basketball team of the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, Tennessee, for eight seasons between 1938 and 1947. Mauer's Volunteers had significant success, posting an overall record of 127–41 (.756), and winning two Southeastern Conference (SEC) championships (1941, 1943) and two SEC tournaments (1941, 1943). In 1945, John led the team to the Quarterfinals in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT). At the time, the National Invitation Tournament was more prestigious than the NCAA Basketball Tournament. During his time as the Volunteers' head basketball coach, he also worked as the head coach of the Tennessee Volunteers baseball team from 1938 to 1942, and as an assistant football coach for the Tennessee Volunteers football team under head coaches Neyland and John Barnhill from 1938 to 1946.\n\nMauer later served as the head coach for the Army Black Knights men's basketball team of the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York, for four seasons from 1947 to 1951, and the Florida Gators men's basketball team of the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, for nine seasons from 1951 to 1960. His four Army Cadets teams finished 33–35 (.485); his nine Gators teams compiled a record of 98–102 (.490). While coaching the Gators basketball team, he also served as an assistant coach for the Florida Gators football team under head coaches Bob Woodruff and Ray Graves.\n\nAfter his final season as the Gators' basketball mentor, Mauer returned to the University of Tennessee and worked as an assistant coach for the Volunteers football team from 1960 to 1963 under head coaches Bowden Wyatt and Jim McDonald.\n\nMauer died in Knoxville on December 20, 1978; he was 77 years old. He was survived by his wife Grace, their two sons, and their five grandchildren.\n\nMauer was the first, and to date the only, person to serve as the head coach in the same sport at three different SEC universities. His winning percentage as the Tennessee Volunteers men's basketball head coach remains the best of the modern era; his winning percentage as the Kentucky Wildcats' head is still among the program's six best of the modern era. Mauer was posthumously inducted into the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame in 2002.\n\n"}

The food court holds 539 stalls, and the second floor serves as a parking lot for 400 cars.\n\nIn addition to the food court, side streets and alleys are lined with storefronts and roadside stands. Cinemas, video arcades, and karaoke bars are also prevalent in the area. Like most night markets in Taiwan, the local businesses and vendors begin opening around 16:00. As students begin returning home from school, crowds reach their peak between 20:00 and 23:00. Businesses continue operating well past midnight, closing around 01:00 or 02:00.\n\nTourist traffic has increased in recent years due to the opening of the Taipei Metro system. The night market is closest to Jiantan Station on Tamsui–Xinyi line (Tamsui/Red Line), and can be seen from the station platform.\n\nThe night market is located near the former location of a wharf on the Keelung River. Agricultural produce from farms in Shilin being shipped to other ports such as Banka and Dadaocheng would typically be sold in this area. The daytime Shilin Market was formally established in this area in 1909, and the market was inaugurated in 1913. With the influx of customers, many new businesses and food vendors began to establish themselves in the area and the Shilin Night Market was born.\n\nShilin Night Market has since become the largest and most well-known night market in Taiwan, especially with regards to food, and is a favorite focal point for Taipei's night life among residents and visitors alike.\n\nDue to safety, sanitation and fire hazard concerns, the old Shilin Market structure was demolished in October 2002 by the Taipei City Government; the food vendors formerly based within the old structure were relocated to a newer temporary structure a few hundred meters away, next to the metro Jiantan Station. Plans for the renovated site began in 1999. Work commenced in 2006 after the relocation of the vendors to the temporary site. The renovated site re-opened in 2011.\n\nShilin Night Market is accessible via the Tamsui–Xinyi line (Taipei Metro) at Jiantan Station. A number of bus routes also serve the area with stops at Jiantan Station, nearby Ming Chuan University, and Xiao Bei (Hsiao Pei) Street.\n\n\n\n"}

Zoroastrianism also has a hereditary priesthood, as does Alevism, Yezidism and Yarsanism. In Sufism, the spiritual guide is also often a hereditary leader, while the Sayyids of India, who claim descent from the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, have been described as a priestly caste.\n\nIn the Russian Eastern Orthodox Church, the clergy, over time, formed a hereditary caste of priests. Marrying outside of these priestly families was strictly forbidden; indeed, some bishops did not even tolerate their clergy marrying outside of the priestly families of their diocese. In 1867, the Synod abolished family claims to clerical positions. Within the lands of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, the largest Eastern Catholic Church, priests' children often became priests and married within their social group, establishing a tightly-knit hereditary caste.\n\nIn other cases, as with the Druids of the Celtic world and the shamans of ancient Eurasian nomads, the position within the caste may have depended more upon apprenticeship; the exact nature of the \"caste\" in these cases is difficult to ascertain due to our lack of primary sources.\n"}

It appears to have been also denominated \"Cleopatris\" (Strabo p. 780) and \"Arsinoites\" (Plin. v. 9. § 9; Orelli, \"Inscr.\" 516). It is also conjectured to have stood on the site of the biblical Pi-hahiroth (Pihachiroth). Exodus ; Numbers ; Winer, \"Biblioth. Realwörterb.\" ii. p. 309. The modern Ardscherúd, a village near Suez, corresponds to this Arsinoe. It was seated near the eastern termination of the Royal canal, which communicated with the Pelusiac branch of the Nile, and which Ptolemy Philadelphus carried on from the Bitter Lakes to the head of the Heroopolite gulf. Arsinoe (Plin. v. 12) was ca. 200 km from Pelusium.\n\nThe revenues of the Arsinoite nome were presented by that monarch to his wife (who was also his sister), Arsinoe II of Egypt, after whom the city was named, and remained the property of successive queens or princesses of the Lagid family. The shortness of the road across the eastern desert and its position near the canal were the principal advantages of Arsinoe as a staple of trade. But although it possessed a capacious bay, it was exposed to the south wind, and the difficulties which ships encountered from reefs in working up the gulf were considerable. Arsinoe, accordingly, was less eligibly situated for the Indian traffic than either Myos Hormos or Berenice. In common, however, with other ports on the Red Sea Arsinoe improved in its commerce after the conquest of Egypt by the Romans. One hundred and twenty vessels annually sailed from Egyptian havens to bring from western India silk, precious stones, and aromatics (Gibbon, D. and F. ch. vi).\n\nDuring the reign of Trajan, the city's fortunes declined with the development of a new canal between the Nile and the Red Sea terminating at Clysma a few km to the west of Arsinoe.\n\nArsinoe is depicted in the first DLC (The Hidden Ones) of the 2017 video game Assassin's Creed Origins. It is shown as a town occupied by Romans, who tear down ancient Egyptian monuments for use as building materials in 38 BC.\n\nLindsey, W.S. |title=History of Merchant Shipping and Ancient Commerce |(London: Sampson Low, 1874) 4 vols. \n"}

They are typically defined by either their designated members' often superficial similarity to each other, or their \"lack\" of one or more distinct character states or by their \"not\" belonging to one or more other taxa. Wastebasket taxa are by definition either paraphyletic or polyphyletic, and are therefore not considered to be valid taxa under strict cladistic rules of taxonomy. The name of a wastebasket taxon may in some cases be retained as the designation of an evolutionary grade, however.\n\n\nFossil groups that are poorly known due to fragmentary remains are sometimes grouped together on gross morphology or stratigraphy, only later to be found to be wastebasket taxa, such as the crocodile-like Triassic group Rauisuchia.\n\nOne of the roles of taxonomists is to identify wastebasket taxa and reclassify the content into more natural units. Sometimes, during taxonomic revisions, the wastebasket taxa can be salvaged after doing thorough research on its members, and then imposing tighter restrictions on what continues to be included. Such techniques \"saved\" Carnosauria and \"Megalosaurus\". Other times, the taxonomic name contains too much unrelated \"baggage\" to be successfully salvaged. As such, it is usually dumped in favour of a new, more restrictive name (for example, Rhynchocephalia), or abandoned altogether (for example, \"Simia\").\n\nA related concept is that of form taxon, \"wastebasket\" groupings that are united by gross morphology. This is often result of a common mode of life, often one that is generalist, leading to generally similar body shapes by convergent evolution.\n\nThe term wastebasket taxon is sometimes employed in a derogatory fashion to refer to an evolutionary grade taxon.\n\n"}

It showcases many images of Canada's cities and sights, including Quebec, Ontario, the RCMP Musical Ride, the Calgary Stampede, Vancouver and Vancouver Harbour, the Ottawa River, and more.\n\nThe movie was filmed mostly during 1981 and has been in continuous exhibition since that time, with an updated version released in 2007. It closed on August 1, 2019 set to be replaced by a new Canadian Circle-Vision film titled \"Canada: Far and Wide.\"\n\nThe attraction was inspired by the popular Circle-Vision 360° documentary film Canada '67, shown at the Telephone pavilion during Expo 67, created by Canadian film director Robert Barclay. The Disney version was described by Barclay as \"a superficial, glib look at the country\".\n\nThe following excerpt shows the similarities between the two films: the official Expo '67 Guide Book described some of the \"Canada '67\" documentary film's many scenes: \"\"You're on centre stage for the RCMP Musical Ride... on centre ice for hockey... on the track at the Stampede!

Pure sodium aluminate (anhydrous) is a white crystalline solid having a formula variously given as NaAlO, NaAl(OH) (hydrated), NaO·AlO, or NaAlO. Commercial sodium aluminate is available as a solution or a solid.\nOther related compounds, sometimes called sodium aluminate, prepared by reaction of NaO and AlO are NaAlO which contains discrete AlO anions, NaAlO and NaAlO which contain complex polymeric anions, and NaAlO, once mistakenly believed to be β-alumina, a phase of aluminium oxide.\n\nAnhydrous sodium aluminate, NaAlO, contains a three-dimensional framework of corner linked AlO tetrahedra. The hydrated form NaAlO·5/4HO has layers of AlO tetrahedra joined into rings and the layers are held together by sodium ions and water molecules that hydrogen bond to O atoms in the AlO tetrahedra.\n\nSodium aluminate is manufactured by the dissolution of- aluminium hydroxide in a caustic soda (NaOH) solution. Aluminium hydroxide (gibbsite) can be dissolved in 20–25% aqueous NaOH solution at a temperature near the boiling point. The use of more concentrated NaOH solutions leads to a semi-solid product. The process must be carried out in steam-heated vessels of nickel or steel, and the aluminium hydroxide should be boiled with approximately 50% aqueous caustic soda until a pulp forms. The final mixture has to be poured into a tank and cooled; a solid mass containing about 70% NaAlO then forms. After being crushed, this product is dehydrated in a rotary oven. The resulting product contains 90% NaAlO and 1% water, together with 1% free NaOH.\n\nSodium aluminate is also formed by the action of sodium hydroxide on elemental aluminium which is an amphoteric metal. The reaction is highly exothermic once established and is accompanied by the rapid evolution of hydrogen gas. The reaction is sometimes written as:\nhowever the species produced in solution is likely to contain the [Al(OH)] ion or perhaps the [Al(HO)(OH)] ion.\n\nIn water treatment it is used as an adjunct to water softening systems, as a coagulant aid to improve flocculation, and for removing dissolved silica and phosphates.\n\nIn construction technology, sodium aluminate is employed to accelerate the solidification of concrete, mainly when working during frost.\n\nSodium aluminate is also used in the paper industry, for fire brick production, alumina production and so forth.\n\nSodium aluminate solutions are intermediates in the production of zeolites.\n\n"}

H. Jacobs of Bentonville, Arkansas. It was scientifically explored by him, in company with Charles Peabody and Warren K. Moorehead, in 1903. The findings were published in that year by Jacobs in the Benton County Sun; by C. N. Gould in \"Science\", July 31, 1903; by Peabody in the \"Am. Anthropologist\", Sept. 903; and in the \"Am. Journ. Archaeology\", 1904; and by Peabody and Moorehead, 1904, as \"Bulletin I. of the Dept. of Archaeology\" in Phillips Academy, Andover, Massachusetts, in the museum of which are exhibits, maps and photographs.\n\nJacobs Cavern is a small cave, hardly more than a rock shelter, and is entirely in the St. Joe Formation of the Mississippian subperiod. Its roof is a single flat stratum of limestone; its walls are well marked by lines of stratification; dripstone also partly covers the walls, fills a deep fissure at the end of the cave, and spreads over the floor, where it mingles with an ancient bed of ashes, forming an ash-breccia (mostly firm and solid) that encloses fragments of sandstone, flint spalls, flint implements, charcoal and bones. Underneath is the true floor of the cave, a mass of homogeneous yellow clay, one meter in thickness. It holds scattered fragments of limestone, and is itself the result of limestone degeneration. The length of the opening is over 21 meters; its depth 14 meters, and the height of roof above the undisturbed ash deposit varied from 1 m 20 cm to 2 m 60 cm The bone recess at the end was from 50 cm. to 80 cm. in height. The stratum of ashes was from 50 cm to 1 m 50 cm thick.\n\nThe ash surface was staked off into square meters, and the substance carefully removed in order. Each stalactite, stalagmite and pilaster was measured, numbered, and removed in sections. Six human skeletons were found buried in the ashes. Seven-tenths of a cubic metre of animal bones were found: deer, bear, wolf, raccoon, opossum, beaver, buffalo, elk, turkey, woodchuck, tortoise and hog; all contemporary with man's occupancy. Three stone metates, one stone axe, one celt and fifteen hammerstones were found. Jacobs Cavern was peculiarly rich in flint knives and projectile points. The sum total amounts to 419 objects, besides hundreds of fragments, cores, spalls and rejects, retained for study and comparison. Considerable numbers of bone or horn awls were found in the ashes, as well as fragments of pottery, but no ceremonial objects.\n\nThe rude type of the implements, the absence of fine pottery, and the peculiarities of the human remains, indicate a trace of occupants more ancient than the mound-builders. The deepest implement observed was buried 50 cm under the stalagmitic surface. Dr. Hovey has proved that the rate of stalagmitic growth in Wyandotte Cave, Indiana, is .0254 cm. annually; and if that was the rate in Jacobs Cavern, 1968 years would have been needed for the embedding of that implement. Polished rocks outside the cavern and pictographs in the vicinity indicate the work of a prehistoric race earlier than the Osage Indians, who were the historic owners previous to the advent of Europeans.\n"}

The species name \"aculeastrum\" refers to the thorns that adorn most parts of the shrub.\n\nBecause of its dense growth and prickly nature, soda apple is used as a hedge and living barrier for containing livestock. It is often used as a soap replacement, as it is high in saponin.

Several of these are ambiguous homonyms:\n\nThe botanist Bitter distinguished a number of subspecies and varieties of the soda apple, but these are not considered valid taxa anymore:\n\n"}

For evidence to be admissible, it must be relevant and \"not excluded by the rules of evidence\", which generally means that it must not be unfairly prejudicial, and it must have some indicia of reliability. The general rule in evidence is that all relevant evidence is admissible and all irrelevant evidence is inadmissible, though some countries (such as the United States and, to an extent, Australia) proscribe the prosecution from exploiting evidence obtained in violation of constitutional law, thereby rendering relevant evidence inadmissible. This rule of evidence is called the exclusionary rule. In the United States this was effectuated federally in 1914 under the Supreme Court case \"Weeks v. United States\" and incorporated against the states in 1961 in the case \"Mapp v. Ohio\", both of which involving law enforcement conducting warrantless searches of the petitioners' homes, with incriminating evidence being descried inside them.\n\nFor evidence to be admissible, it must tend to prove or disprove some fact at issue in the proceeding. However, if the utility of this evidence is outweighed by its tendency to cause the fact finder to disapprove of the party it is introduced against for some unrelated reason, it is not admissible. Furthermore, certain public-policy considerations bar the admission of otherwise relevant evidence.\n\nFor evidence to be admissible enough to be admitted, the party proffering the evidence must be able to show that the source of the evidence makes it so. If evidence is in the form of witness testimony, the party that introduces the evidence must lay the groundwork for the witness's credibility and knowledge. Hearsay is generally barred for its lack of reliability. If the evidence is documentary, the party proffering the evidence must be able to show that it is authentic, and must be able to demonstrate the chain of custody from the original author to the present holder. The trial judge performs a \"gatekeeping\" role in excluding unreliable testimony. The United States Supreme Court first addressed the reliability requirement for experts in the landmark case \"Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\". The Court laid out four non-exclusive factors that trial courts may consider when evaluating scientific expert reliability: (1) whether scientific evidence has been tested and the methodology with which it has been tested; (2) whether the evidence has been subjected to peer review or publication; (3) whether a potential rate of error is known; and (4) whether the evidence is generally accepted in the scientific community. \"Kumho Tire Co., Ltd. v. Carmichael\" later extended the \"Daubert\" analysis to include all expert testimony. It bears an effect on the verdict of the court.\n\nIn some non-democratic legal systems, the courts effectively function as organs of those in power, and the rules of evidence are designed to favor their interests. In the People's Republic of China, for example, it has been observed that courts have historically accepted evidence that would be excluded in other systems, such as confessions obtained by torture. Evidence was introduced by the court itself, rather than the state, and evidence was used as part of \"a process of legitimising the conclusion which had already been drawn before the trial\". These practices have, in theory, been reformed by legislation, but questions remain as to whether they continue in practice.\n"}
{"id": "2094884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2094884", "title": "Gyroball", "text": "Gyroball\n\nA gyroball is a type of baseball pitch used primarily by players in Japan. It is thrown with a spiral-like spin, so that there is no Magnus force on the ball as it arrives at home plate. The gyroball is sometimes confused with the shuuto, another pitch used in Japan.\n\nThe gyroball pitch was first identified by the Japanese scientist Ryutaro Himeno (姫野 龍太郎), and later developed into a specific throwing technique by baseball instructor Kazushi Tezuka (手塚 一志), who used computer simulations to create a new style of delivery intended to reduce stress on the pitcher. They published their work in a book, currently available only in Japan, the title of which is roughly translated as \"The Secret of the Miracle Pitch\" (魔球の正体).\n\nHowever, the technique to throwing the gyroball is all in the arms, not in the unique grip of the baseball. Kazushi Tezuka is an instructor at the \"Jyoutatsuya baseball dojo\" in Tokyo, and Osaka, Japan. According to Tezuka, use of the arms \"is the most important part of throwing the gyroball. It has nothing to do with the hands.\"\n\nHimeno and Tezuka have said, a gyroball is thrown so that at the point of release, instead of having the pitcher's elbow move inwards, towards the body (the standard method used in the United States), the pitcher rotates his elbow so that it moves away from his body, toward third base for a right-handed pitcher and toward first base for a left-handed pitcher. This is also known as pronation.\n\nThe unusual method of delivery creates a bullet-like spin on the ball with the axis of spin in line with the direction of the throw, similar to the way an American football is thrown. Tezuka has stated, if the pitch is thrown correctly, it will fly straight like a fastball. Contrary to early speculation that the gyroball was a late moving breaking ball, the fact that the pitch travels with a bullet-spin denotes that the baseball is stabilized, hence the lack of movement. In baseball, most pitches are thrown with back-spin, like the usual fastball, or with a top-spin, like the curveball and the slider.\n\nWhen throwing a gyroball, a pitcher holds the side of the ball with a fastball grip placed on the baseball's center (or equator). The pitcher's hips and throwing shoulder must be in near-perfect sync, something the book refers to as \"double-spin mechanics.\" According to Tezuka, the arm angle needs to be low, no higher than a sidearm delivery. As the pitcher rotates his shoulder, he snaps his wrist and pulls down his fingers rather than flipping them over the ball, as happens with curveballs. For the correct spin axis, the equatorial plane must first be determined by the proper finger pressure during release. The ball rolls off the index and middle fingers to the thumb side of the hand as the pitch is released. If gripped in the right manner, the rotation will have a true side-spin; if the ball is held above or below its equator, the rotation would be unstable. When the pitcher lets go, he must pronate his wrist, or turn it so the palm faces third base. \n\nIncidentally, the flight of some Knuckleball pitches, such as those thrown by R.A. Dickey, also have a forward pointing rotational axis similar to a gyroball. The difference is, the knuckleball spins significantly more slowly and has less velocity, which greatly subjects the baseball to the effects of drag as well as gravity, and translates into an erratic flight-path. However, this shows that a bullet-like spiral is consistently achievable despite differing methods of pitch delivery. A gyroball's stability is dependent upon its rotation speed and the amount of forward motion, resulting in a straight trajectory with less drop.\n\nBatters use the arm speed of the pitcher and the spin on a baseball, made visible by the seams, to judge the speed and trajectory of a pitch. The gyroball is thrown with the arm speed of a usual fastball, but with a different actual speed. Its bullet-like spinning motion may hide the seams of a ball from the view of the batter, making it difficult to predict the pitch. Typical strategy entails throwing many variations of pitches, followed by a gyroball. The batter, predicting a change in speed caused by the ball's spin, may adapt to the wrong speed and swing incorrectly.\n\nThe gyroball is also often confused with a completely different Japanese pitch called the shuuto, due to an error in a well-known article by baseball writer Will Carroll. Although Carroll later corrected himself, the confusion still persists.\n\nIn March 2005, Baseball Mogul was the first game to include the \"Gyroball\". The pitch was included in the arsenal of Daisuke Matsuzaka. However, because Matsuzaka was not yet with the Red Sox, players had to simulate into the 2006 season before the gyroball became available. Additionally, the gyroball is available in Baseball Mogul's player editor, and can be learned in Spring Training by pitchers that enter the game after 2005. In the game's graphical play-by-play mode, the pitch comes out of the pitcher's hand as a fastball, but fails to rise like a traditional four-seam fastball.\n\nIn the video game \"\" and the more recent \"The Bigs\", only Daisuke Matsuzaka has the ability to throw the gyroball, although the movement of the pitch in the video game differs from the movement of the actual pitch. Daisuke Matsuzaka has himself stated, \"looks like they are talking about my cut fastball or sinking slider. I guess sometimes it has a similar rotation of a gyro, when I fail to throw the cut fastball or the slider properly, but it is not exactly a gyro itself. It is different. There is a particular way of throwing it. I guess it is a kind of shuuto-like cut fastball\". (However, in the long-lasting Japan-Baseball game series Jikkyō Powerful Pro Yakyū series, Daisuke is never given \"Gyroball\" ability for any installment, nor in the MLB Power Pros series installment.) It is an obtainable ability in the MLB Power Pros series, and its effect is to make the fastball look faster.\n\nIn the Japanese manga and anime baseball series \"Major\", the protagonist, Goro, is known for his use of the gyroball pitch, which was his only pitch until he eventually adds a forkball to his repertoire.\n\nThe gyroball is often confused with a changeup, but the beginning speed is the same as a fastball.\n\n\n"}

At the age of 21, she married TV director Samim Değer and started to work as a model before taking part in Turkish B movies. After making about 100 B films & family comedy films between early 70s and early 1980s, her breakthrough came with the 1984 Yavuz Turgul film \"Fahriye Abla\" (\"Sister Fahriye\"). \"Fahriye Abla\" was the screen adaptation of Ahmed Muhip Dranas' poem of the same name.\n\nHer portrayal of modern, sensual, independent, rebel woman in her films after \"Fahriye Abla\" won the hearts of Turkish filmgoers. It was considered a revolution in the relatively conservative mainstream Turkish cinema at that time, when females played mostly second fiddle roles. Mujde Ar then became the cult object of women cinema and the lead of many films by renowned Turkish directors Atıf Yılmaz, Halit Refiğ, Başar Sabuncu, Ertem Eğilmez.

The caves and reserve are situated approximately west of Sydney, east of and west of Katoomba.\n\nThe caves are the most visited of several similar groups in the limestone caves of the country, and the most ancient discovered open caves in the world. They include numerous Silurian marine fossils and the calcite formations, sometimes pure white, are noted for their beauty. The cave network follows the course of a subterranean section of the Jenolan River. It has more than of multi-level passages and over 300 entrances. The complex is still being explored. The caves are a tourist destination, with eleven illuminated show caves open to paying visitors.\n\nThe caves and conservation reserve are one of the eight protected areas that was inscribed in 2000 to form part of the UNESCO World Heritage-listed Greater Blue Mountains Area. The Jenolan Karst Conservation Reserve is the most westerly of the eight protected areas within the World Heritage Site. The reserve forms part of the Great Dividing Range and was listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate in 1978. The Jenolan Caves are listed on the Australian National Heritage List. On 25 June 2004 Jenolan Caves Reserve (excluding the caves) were listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register with the following inscription:\nThe word \"Jenolan\" is believed to be an indigenous word for \"high place\"; derived from the Tharawal word, \"Genowlan\", for a \"high place shaped like a foot\". An alternative (although highly unlikely) meaning comes from the name \"J E Nolan\" that was found smoked by a candle on the roof of a cave.\n\nBy measuring the ratio of radioactive potassium and trapped argon gas, which was produced when the potassium decayed, scientists determined the age of the clay in the caves to be approximately 340 million years old, thereby making the cave complex the world's oldest known and dated open cave system. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in association with the University of Sydney and the Australian Museum lead the efforts in scientific research into the caves.\n\nFor thousands of years, the Jenolan area has been part of the culture of local indigenous peoples. The area holds significance to the Gundungurra and Wiradjuri peoples, who knew it as \"Binomil\" or \"Bin-oo-mur\", and a variety of similar names. A Dreamtime creation story of the Gundungurra people describes how the countryside came into being, and involves a struggle between two ancestral creator spirits – one a giant eel-like creature, Gurangatch, and the other, Mirrigan, a large native cat or quoll. The Gundungurra people penetrated the caves as far as the subterranean water, carrying sick people to be bathed in this water, which they believed to have curative powers.\n\nThere are no known contemporaneous accounts of the discovery of the caves by Europeans – though Charles Whalan is attributed as the first to conduct visitors to the caves in the 1840s. However, in Charles Whalan's obituary and other sources, credit for the caves' discovery is given to his brother, James Whalan. Though most accounts were written some decades after the initial discovery, and differ somewhat in the details, it is generally accepted that in 1838 (or possibly 1841), James Whalan was in pursuit of an ex-convict and active local thief named McKeown, who had stolen livestock, tools, clothing and a flour grinder, was tracked to the area. In this pursuit, James Whalan discovered the cave system and reported its existence to his brother Charles – who further explored the caves.\n\nThe caves, originally known as the Fish River Caves, came under the control of the NSW Government in 1866—becoming only the second area in the world reserved for the purpose of conservation. The following year, Jeremiah Wilson was appointed as the first \"Keeper of the Caves\". Wilson not only explored the already known Elder and Lucas Caves but later discovered the Imperial, Left Imperial (now known as Chifley), Jersey and Jubilee Caves.\n\nThe caves were open to tourism early, but there was little protection from visitors damaging formations until the collection of souvenirs and the writing of graffiti was banned in 1872. In 1884 the name Jenolan Caves was adopted.\n\nThe road to the caves originally went via , which meant that travellers from the south had to take a long, roundabout route of about from Katoomba to Oberon, and, from there, to Tarana. In the mid-1880s, hotel keepers in Katoomba wanted to improve business by constructing a road to the Caves from their town, but the steep, rough ground between the caves and town was a major obstacle, and several attempts failed. However, representations were made to the Premier by Peter Fitzpatrick of Burragorang, who was connected to some mining operations near Katoomba. In April 1884, William Marshall Cooper, Surveyor of Public Parks for the State Government, was assigned the job, and worked out a horse-and-carriage track in a 10-day trek from Katoomba to the Caves. The route was, he remarked, 26.5 miles from the Western Hotel in Katoomba. \"... Anyone accustomed to walking can do it comfortably in 12 hours ... when the proposed horse track is completed, it will be a very enjoyable ride of five hours.\" It became known as the Six Foot Track.\n\nBy 1885, Parliament had approved A₤2,500 for the construction of Cooper's bridle track, with the work starting at the most difficult area, the Megalong Cleft, where a zig-zag had to be cut, partly in solid rock, to reduce the grade to 1:5.5. The first recorded passage of the completed bridle track from Katoomba to Jenolan was by the Governor, Lord Carrington, in September 1887. Lord Carrington also made the first official visit to the caves at the completion of his journey, accompanied by Wilson.\n\nIn 1898 the current Jenolan Caves House was built, replacing the earlier wooden accommodation house built by Jeremiah Wilson, which had been partially destroyed in 1895 by fire.\n\nJ. C. (Voss) Wiburd became \"Keeper of the Caves\" in 1903 and discovered (with fellow guide and friend Jack Edwards) five more caves within eighteen months: the River, Pool of Cerberus, Temple of Baal, Orient and Ribbon Caves. He remained Keeper until 1932, when he left due to the Government's policy at the time of compulsory retirement at the age of 65.\n\nThe Chifley Cave, originally known as the Left Imperial Cave, was renamed in 1952 in honour of Ben Chifley, the recently retired Federal local member of parliament and former Prime Minister. This cave was the first of the caves to have been diamonds inside, as early as 1880. In 1968, the Orient Cave became the first in the world to be cleaned, due to contamination by mud from the previous access route and a nearby coal boiler. The soot from the boiler was entering the cave via a new tunnel blasted 400 feet through to the Orient cave in 1954 to allow easier access (entering at Bat End). Steam cleaning was found to be damaging to the crystal formations, due to the rapid expansion and contraction caused by the heat from the steam, and these days water from the caves' own underground rivers is used if cave cleaning becomes necessary.\n\nSince 2011, the CSIRO in association with the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation began using a new hand-held mapping system to map some of the caves in three-dimensional detail.\n\nLarge portions of this extensive cave system are accessible only to experienced cavers, especially those areas along the underground river system.\n\nEleven show caves have been developed for regular tourism and are open to the public.\n\nThe Jenolan Caves are located three hours' drive from Sydney and Canberra. Private coach companies operate day tours from Sydney and from Katoomba railway station. There is no public transport to Jenolan Caves. The caves attract over 250,000 visitors a year, making it one of the most popular tourist locations in rural New South Wales, and has won numerous tourism awards.\n\nHistorically the caves were only accessible via the Six Foot Track, a 45-kilometre-long bridle trail from Katoomba established in 1884. This trail became in disused in the early 1900s after new roads were built in the area, but was reopened as a bushwalking track in 1984. It is now one of the most popular overnight bushwalks in the Blue Mountains area.\n\nTen of the area's \"dark caves\" are open for regular guided tours every day (1 to 2 hours per tour). These show cave tour sizes vary. For example, the delicate Pool of Cerberus Cave can have only 8 on a tour, while the Lucas Cave (with its large chambers) can have up to 65 people per tour.\n\nTours vary in difficulty. Imperial Cave, for example, has the fewest stairs, while the River Cave is the most strenuous. The average tourist can tour any of these show caves.\n\nA self-guided tour of the huge Nettle Cave/Devils Coach House is also available. The self-guided tour gives visitors a choice of many languages. One of the choices on the self-guided tour is an Aboriginal culture commentary.\n\nNight tours run every night except Sundays, including the popular ghost tour, 'Legends, Mysteries & Ghosts'.\n\nSeveral undeveloped caves are available for adventure caving (2-hour to all-day tours). These adventure caving tours include the Plughole Tour, which runs daily and includes basic abseiling. Other more challenging adventure caving tours are available.\n\nThe Cathedral Chamber, part of the \"Lucas Cave\" is famous for its acoustics. Underground concerts take place in this chamber. Concerts also take place in the Grand Arch, including the annual 'Carols in the Caves', which raises money for charity.\n\nDuring school holidays, specially-developed tours are available for children. Jenolan Caves has long been a popular destination for school excursions.\n\nTourists visiting Jenolan Caves can stay at the heritage-listed Jenolan Caves House. It was designed in 1897 by government architect Walter Liberty Vernon as a resort or retreat for the wealthy. To cater for the expectations of the well-to-do, Vernon included a ballroom and grand dining room, now Chisolm's Restaurant. Chisolm's is open for dinner every day, serving modern Australian cuisine. Facilities include an hotel/motel complex, self-contained cottages, restaurant, bar, and cafe.\n\nAs at 15 June 2004, Jenolan Caves Reserve is of state significance for its historical, aesthetic, research and rarity values. The caves and karst landscapes developed as important scientific and tourist destinations throughout the late 19th and 20th centuries, and the Reserve is highly significant as the first public reserve set aside in NSW for the protection of a natural resource - in this case, the Jenolan Caves.\n\nThe Reserve is highly regarded for the aesthetic qualities of the caves and cave formations, reflected in cave names such as Aladdin and Gem Cave; for the ability of the caves to demonstrate technological developments such as the first use of electric cave lighting in the 1880s, and the first development of hydro-electric power in Australia. The setting of the caves hamlet in the Jenolan Valley, with the tiny hamlet and picturesque Caves House almost dwarfed by steeply rising cliffs on all sides, the entrance into the hamlet through the fortress-like Grand Arch, and the distinctive Blue Lake formed by the weir for the hydro-electric scheme, all combine to form a landscape of great beauty and distinctiveness.\n\nThe Reserve has the ability to yield information on the geological history of NSW and of the Australian continent, and for the archaeological potential of the hamlet area to provide evidence of the early period in the development of tourism in NSW.\n\nThe number of rare and uncommon flora and fauna species to which it is home, especially within the caves; and the evidence it can demonstrate of the development of tourism, especially mountain and caving tourism, in NSW, add to the significance of the Jenolan Caves Reserve (HO).\n\nThe geomorphic history of the Jenolan Caves system is extremely complex, the cave system contains an exceptionally diverse variety of karst and cave types illustrating the full range of processes and products from incipient, scarcely perceptible depressions through to multistage cave developments and decayed remnant features. The McKeowns Valley, north of Blue Lake contains the finest such assemblage in Australia. The Jenolan River valley is one of the most outstanding fluviokarst valleys in the world. The range and diversity of the karst and decoration, including a remarkable diversity of mineral species, is varied, profuse and equal to the finest in the world. The Jenolan Caves and surrounding areas contains a very diverse assemblage of morphologies and mineral species. There is evidence in these features of the influences of palaeo-landscapes.\nThe contribution to the formation of the landscape of structural influences, lithological influences, and drainage patterns is the source of considerable scientific and educational interest at Jenolan. The geomorphology of Jenolan includes a variety of non karstic phenomena that are important because of their relationship with the karst. Because these features lie adjacent to, and in some cases over, the karst they give considerable insight into the formation of the karst. A large number of invertebrate fossils have been discovered in the limestone of the Jenolan Caves. These include corals, stromatoporoids, algae, brachiopods, gastropods and straight nautiloids. Subfossil remains of many vertebrates are also found in the caves.\n\nThe caves provide shelter and habitat for a number of rare species including the Greater sooty owl (\"Tyto tenebricosa tenebricosa\") (rare in Australia) which roosts in the cave known as the Devil's Coach House and the Jenolan Caves Reserve supports a population of the brush-tailed rock-wallaby (\"Petrogale penicillata\"). This species is listed as vulnerable on Schedule 12 of the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Act. Also found in the caves is the opilionid arachnid \"Holonuncia cavernicola\" which is known only from the Jenolan Caves system. The Caves Reserve contains three rare or endangered plant species. These are \"Pseudanthus divaricatissimus\" (3RC), \"Gonocarpus longifolius\" (3RC), and Geranium graniticola (3RC). In the latter half of the 19th century the caves were recognised as perhaps the premier natural attraction in Australia. Although they no longer occupy this role, Jenolan remains one of the most important natural heritage areas in Australia. The caves are a very high-profile natural feature in NSW. The Jenolan Caves area is widely used as a research and teaching site for studying the geomorphology and processes involved in karst formation.\n\nJenolan is one of the most important areas of natural and cultural history in Australia. The area includes one of the largest and most beautiful interconnected cave systems in Australia and is an outstanding site of geological and speleological interest. The Jenolan River, Blue Lake and a system of intimate valleys and watercourses provide a magnificent setting for a distinctive range of native vegetation and fauna. The Caves Reserve was created in 1866, six years before the declaration of the world's first National Park. Since its reported discovery by James Whalan between 1838 and 1841 the area has attracted more than three million visitors. Caves House, and its associated outbuildings, adds to the area's cultural significance. The area also contains a number of important industrial relics, including Australia's first hydro-electric power station and the remnants of the first electric lighting of caves which was installed in the Chifley Cave in 1887.\n\nJenolan Caves was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 25 June 2004 having satisfied the following criteria.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.\n\nJenolan Caves Reserve is of state significance for its ability to demonstrate the significant historical activity of identifying and conserving the natural resources of NSW - in this case, the caves and karst landscapes that have developed as important scientific and tourist destinations throughout the late 19th and 20th centuries. The Reserve is highly significant as the first public reserve set aside in NSW for the protection of a natural resource - in this case, the caves, and as such predates the creation of The National Park in 1879. The caves hamlet illustrates the significant human activity of providing accommodation for travellers and tourists since the 1890s in romantic buildings especially designed for this purpose by the Government Architect (HO).\n\nThe place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.\n\nJenolan Caves Reserve is significant for its associations with Government Architect Walter Liberty Vernon, who design much of Caves House. Although only the first or 1897 wing was built during his tenure, his plans were respected and adapted by subsequent government architects so that the original style and setting for the building has been largely maintained to the present day (HO).\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.\n\nJenolan Caves Reserve is of state significance for the highly regarded aesthetic qualities of the caves and cave formations, reflected in cave and formation names such as Aladdin, Orient and Temple of Baal caves and Gem, Arabesque, Angel's Wing and Pool of Reflections formations; for the ability of the caves to demonstrate technological developments such as the first use of electric cave lighting in the 1880s, and the first development of hydro-electric power in Australia. The setting of the caves hamlet in the Jenolan Valley, with the tiny hamlet and picturesque Caves House almost dwarfed by steeply rising cliffs on all sides, the entrance into the hamlet through the fortress-like Grand Arch, and the distinctive Blue Lake formed by the weir for the hydro-electric scheme, all combine to form a landmark landscape of great beauty and distinctiveness (HO).\n\nThe place is has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.\n\nJenolan Caves Reserve is of state significance for its associations with many groups of people, three of which have been particularly identified - tourists, speleologists (that is, those who study caves and engage in caving) and guides. From the 1860s travellers and cavers have visited the Reserve, and cavers have continued to explore and make know to the public more of the caves, their connecting passages and the often unique plants and animals that inhabit this subterranean and lightless world. The caves are also important to the community of caretakers and guides who for nearly 150 years have guided visitors through the caves, shown them the beauty and wonders of the caverns, interpreted and educated people about the geological history of eastern Australia, and made the caves hamlet their home (HO).\n\nThe place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.\n\nJenolan Caves Reserve is of state significance for its ability to yield information on the geological history of NSW and of the Australian continent, as the benchmark karst landscapes contained within the NSW reserve system, and for the archaeological potential of the hamlet area to provide evidence of the early period in the development of tourism in NSW (HO).\n\nThe place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.\n\nThe Jenolan Caves Reserve is of state significance for the number of rare and uncommon flora and fauna species to which it is home, especially within the caves; for containing the greatest diversity of cave invertebrates in NSW; and for the evidence it can demonstrate of the development of tourism, especially mountain and caving tourism, for over a century and a half in NSW (HO).\n\n\n\n\n"}

The \"B\" (actually \"Б\") in her designation stands for большая (\"bolshaya\", \"large\")—Foxtrots were the Soviet Navy's largest non-nuclear submarines. \"B-39\" is now a museum ship on display at the Maritime Museum of San Diego, California, United States.\n\nHer keel was laid down on 9 February 1962 at the Admiralty Shipyard in Leningrad (now known as Saint Petersburg). She was launched on 15 April 1967 and commissioned on 28 December 1967.\n\nTransferred to the 9th Submarine Squadron of the Pacific Fleet, \"B-39\" was homeported in Vladivostok. She conducted patrols and stalked U.S. warships throughout the North Pacific, along the coast of the United States and Canada, and ranging as far as the Indian Ocean and the Arctic Ocean. After the end of the Vietnam War, she often made port visits to Danang. During the early 1970s, \"B-39\" trailed a Canadian frigate through Strait of Juan de Fuca to Vancouver Island.\n\nIn 1989, in the Sea of Japan while charging batteries on the surface, \"B-39\" came within of an of the US Navy. Both crews took pictures of each other.\n\n\"B-39\" was decommissioned on 1 April 1994 and sold to Finland. She made her way from there through a series of sales to Vancouver Island in 1996 and to Seattle, Washington, in 2002 before arriving in San Diego, California, on 22 April 2005 and becoming an exhibit of the Maritime Museum of San Diego. During her sequence of owners she acquired the names \"Black Widow\" and \"Cobra\", neither of which she had during her commissioned career.\n\nWhen \"B-39\" was made a museum the shroud around her attack periscope was cut away where it passes through her control room. As built, a Foxtrot's periscopes are only accessible from her conning tower, which is off-limits in the museum. With the shroud cut away, tourists can look through the partially raised periscope (which is directed toward the museum, some away). However, the unidentified and unexplained change gives the false impression that one periscope could be used from the control room.\n\nAt one point \"B-39\" was slated to be sunk to create an offshore diving reef, but an outcry from teachers and enthusiasts have ensured the sub will stay put for the time being.\n\nIn 2000, while stored in Vancouver, \"B-39\" was used as a stage for scenes in the \"Stargate SG-1\" episode \"Small Victories\". In 2012 it was a stage for the movie \"Phantom\".\n\n\"B-39\" is badly rusted with large holes visible in the outer hull and upper deck. While efforts to underway to keep her afloat for the time being, there are no plans to repair the extensive hull damage and it is expected she will have to be sunk at some time in the future.\n\nDue to the tight passages between compartments, guests are asked to climb through an obstacle before boarding the \"B-39\". The obstacle can be found on the dock near the ramps leading to the submarine's deck. It resembles a large cylinder and represents the 4 doorways through the bulkheads.\n\n\n"}

There he attended Canisius College for his secondary studies, where he concentrated on modern languages. He entered the novitiate at Mariendaal on 7 September 1948. After completing philosophy studies at Berchmans Institute in Nijmegen, he was assigned to Lebanon, where he completed his doctorate in Sacred Theology at Université de Saint-Joseph in Beirut. On 29 June 1961, he was ordained a priest in the Armenian Catholic Church, an Eastern-rite church in communion with Rome.\n\nThe next years of his life were spent in academia, specifically in linguistics. From 1964 to 1976 he taught general and Oriental linguistics in The Hague, Paris, and then Beirut where he became Professor of General Linguistics and Armenian at Université Saint-Joseph. He served in that capacity until 1981, when he became rector of the Pontifical Oriental Institute.\n\nDuring his time on the faculty of Saint-Joseph, he also served as provincial superior of the Jesuit vice-province of the Middle East.\n\nOn 7 August 1981, Father General Pedro Arrupe suffered a severe stroke in the plane on his way back to Rome. Although he survived for another ten years, he wanted to step down as Superior General. Though Arrupe proposed Vincent O'Keefe of Fordham University as interim successor, Pope John Paul II intervened and named Paolo Dezza his delegate to lead the order for an interim period. Two years later John Paul II allowed the Jesuits to proceed in selecting their new leader. Meeting in September 1983, the 33rd General Congregation of the Society of Jesus accepted the formal resignation of Father Arrupe and on the first ballot elected Father Kolvenbach to be 29th Superior General of the Jesuits.\n\nKolvenbachtook office at a time when the Jesuits' \"strongly pro-social justice and church reform orientation was seen by critics as having made the Jesuits something akin to John Paul’s in-house opposition. ...Over time, Kolvenbach was credited with having managed to win back the trust of John Paul II and his Vatican team, without alienating the more liberal members of the order.\"\n\nHe is credited with successfully defending French Jesuit theologian Jacques Dupuis from charges made by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, and Fr. Thomas J. Reese who was removed as editor of America magazine by the insistence of the Vatican says that he “always felt that Kolvenbach did everything he could to defend me.\" He manifested his personal interest in each Jesuit's work, with an interest in meeting each Jesuit individually.” He traveled extensively to visit Jesuits in 112 countries, and “his knowledge of them and their ministries is legendary.” He also emphasized the need to make laypersons feel their place of equal partnership in Jesuit ministries, recognizing with Vatican II that “holiness is one - that sanctity is cultivated by all who are moved by the Spirit of God'.\" He expressed his belief that “the church of the next millennium will be called the 'church of the laity' ...this development is a 'grace of our day and a hope for the future'.\"\n\nOn 2 February 2006, Kolvenbach informed the members of the Society of Jesus that he intended to step down in 2008, the year he would turn 80. As the Superior General is elected for life, Kolvenbach was only the second to resign the office.\n\nThe 35th General Congregation of the Society of Jesus convened on 5 January 2008 in Rome. On 14 January it accepted Kolvenbach's resignation and elected Adolfo Nicolás as his successor.\n\nKolvenbach died in Beirut on 26 November 2016 and is buried outside Beirut on the grounds of Collège Notre Dame de Jamhour.\n"}

His first success came when BBC Radio accepted his pilot comedy script for \"People Like Us\". It ran for three series on BBC Radio 4 from 1995 and won Sony Radio Award and a Writer's Guild Award for Best Radio Comedy before being adapted for BBC Two (with Langham in the same role) in 1999.\n\nMorton went on to create and write the Sony Radio Award-winning satirical newspaper supplement show \"The Sunday Format\" for BBC Radio 4 and co-created the BBC One sitcom \"Kiss Me Kate\" with Chris Langham.

{"id": "2094950", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2094950", "title": "The Path (album)", "text": "The Path (album)\n\nThe Path is the tenth studio album by English acoustic roots duo Show of Hands, released in April 2003. The album was conceived as an \"instrumental journey\" around the South West Coast Path, a 630-mile coastline path opened in 1978 in the duo's native West Country, and a celebration of the coastline's \"sights and sounds\". It is the band's only completely instrumental album, with each of its songs named after and inspired by different locations on the path. It was a project between Show Of Hands and The South West Coast Path Team, as part of the latter's celebrations for the silver jubilee (25th anniversary) of the path. As such the album is endorsed by various organisations who own different parts of the path, namely The Countryside Agency, The National Trust and English Heritage Commission.and the music is ambient instrumentals inspired by different locations around the coastline.\n\nThe duo hoped that, with the album, listeners would be inspired to discover or rediscover the \"endless fascination\" of the coast path. The album was released on 14 April 2003 by the duo's own label Hands on Music, a month before they released their following album \"Country Life\". In July 2012, music from \"The Path\" featured in several themed videos on a new interactive official website for the South West Coast Path, which attracts some 400,000 hits a year. One track from the album, \"Port Isaac\", featured on their compilation album \"\" (2007).\n\nShow of Hands entered the 2000s by recording an album of cover versions, \"Covers\" (2000), which presented a stripped down sound with no overdubs or multitracking. They followed this their second concert at the Royal Albert Hall which was filmed for their VHS concert film \"The Big Gig\" (2001), which itself was followed by their ninth studio album, \"Cold Frontier\" (2001), which was co-produced between the duo and Mick Dolan, engineer for Steve Winwood. Critical praise greeted both releases, and the duo embarked on The Cold Frontier Tour in November 2001, where they played a great deal of unreleased or \"rare\" material. The band's live album \"Cold Cuts\" (2002), which was drawn from material from the tour, was released to positive reviews. The duo began writing for what they planned to be their next album.\nMeanwhile, The Countryside Agency were looking to celebrate the silver jubilee (25th anniversary) of the South West Coast Path, a National Trail that remains the longest waymarked long-distance footpath (and one of the longest in the UK). It stretches for , running from Minehead in Somerset, along the coasts of Devon and Cornwall, to Poole Harbour in Dorset. It is also one of the more challenging trails as it rises and falls with every river mouth, and its total height climbed has been calculated to be 114,931 ft (35,031 m), almost four times the height of Mount Everest. It has been voted \"Britain's Best Walking Route\" twice in a row by readers of the Ramblers \"Walk\" magazine, and regularly features in lists of the world's best walks.\n\nThe South West Coast Path Association formed in 1973, and after being constructed over five years, the path was opened in 1978. To celebrate the silver jubilee of the association in 1998, they set up a fund to raise money for markers at Minehead and South Haven Point, and erected \"Path Markers\" on the path at Minehead in 2001 and South Haven Point in 2002. To celebrate the silver jubilee of the path's opening, Show of Hands, who had begun work on their tenth album \"Country Life\", were asked by The South West Coast Path Association to create an album of music celebrating the path and the sites that it visits. Show of Hands are from Devon, the only English country to have two coastlines, and the South West Coast Path crosses both of them. As such, it became a local project for the duo. The duo changed their focus from \"Country Life\" to the album concerning the coast path's silver jubilee. As different parts of the path are owned by different charities and organisations, namely The National Trust, English Heritage and The Countryside Agency, the album would also be endorsed by those organisations. The duo named the album simply \"The Path\", after the path.\n\nUnlike the band's previous albums, which feature songs, \"The Path\" is completely instrumental, and to date remains their only completely instrumental album. The album is set up as an \"instrumental journey\" around the coast path, and a celebration of the path's \"sights and sounds\". Each of the album's sixteen tracks is named after a specific location on the path's track. As such, the album is seen as a concept album. The duo's website states that the album \"creates an atmospheric musical portrait of the sea, and the seaside\". Whilst the album is folk music, it has also been described as an ambient album. Describing the coast path, the duo noted that \"the full 630 mile adventure around the coastline of the southwest peninsula has now become the region's most popular attraction. From the Exmoor National Park to Poole harbour there is no better way to enjoy our dramatic coastline, its wildlife, history and culture,\" and the duo hoped that, with the album, listeners would be inspired to discover - or rediscover its \"endless fascination\".\n\nThe album is co-produced between Show of Hands, Matt Clifford and Mick Dolan, and all producers wrote music featured on the album, making this a departure from most of the duo's previous albums, which were predominately written by Steve Knightley of the duo. Several of the tracks are instrumental reworkings of older material. Knightley wrote the album's first track, \"Foreland Point\", whilst the second track, \"Braunton Burrows\", is adapted from a track from Beer's sporadic collaborator Paul Downes, whilst his composition \"Lamorna Cave\" was also recorded for the seventh track. Matt Clifford wrote the third track, \"Buck's Mills\". The fourth track, \"Port Isaac\", is essentially an instrumental reworking of the duo's earlier song \"Cousin Jack\", about miners of the Cornish diaspora departing from Port Isaac, which featured on their sixth studio album \"Dark Fields\" (1997). The final, sixteenth track, \"The Foreland – Reprise\", is a reworking of the album's first track, \"Foreland Point\".\n\nPhil Beer of the duo had previously released the collaborative album \"Ridgeriders\" in 1999, a soundtrack to the ITV Meridian television series of the same name presented by Nick Knowles which featured Knowles visiting the ancient trackways of Southern England on a motorcycle. The album, a collaboration between Ashley Hutchings, Chris While, The Albion Band and Julie Matthews, was also a \"journey\" concept album featuring sixteen songs mostly set in different locations in Southern England, with some of the songs named after the locations, making it similar in some sense to \"The Path\". \"Ridgeriders\" was released in June 1999 to positive reviews, including one from \"Living Tradition\" who said \"interesting concept album with enough interest for those who never saw the series, but for those readers north of the Border, it is very English in feel.\"\n\n\"The Path\" was released on 14 April 2003 on Compact Disc by the duo's own record label Hands on Music with the catalogue number HMCD18. The album cover features a photograph of Pendeen Lighthouse, which is visited on the path, by Graham Norways. The back cover features the logos for The National Trust, English Heritage and The Countryside Agency. The duo explained that this was because the coast path is mostly funded by The Countryside Agency, whilst a third of the land the path crosses is owned by The National Trust, whilst Pendennis Castle, visited in the path and the name of one of the track's on the album, is within the ownership of English Heritage. The disc face features a map of the coast path. The album was not reviewed by any publications, perhaps due to its low-key release.\n\nAfter the album's release, the duo returned to work on \"Country Life\", which was released in October 2003. \"Country Life\" ironically features a greater focus on rural issues, most notably on its first song, \"Country Life\", a \"stirring\" and \"finely honed rant about the desecration of British country life\" It was packaged with a bonus disc which contained CD-ROM bonus material, including a lyrics section set to \"The Exe Estuary\" from \"The Path\". The same track was also performed live by Knightley in an acoustic variation for his BBC Radio 4 documentary \"Open Country\" in 2010. In July 2012, music from \"The Path\" featured in several themed videos on a new interactive official website for the South West Coast Path, which attracts some 400,000 hits a year. One track from the album, \"Port Isaac\", features on their \"best of\" compilation album \"\" (2007). It features on the second disc, subtitled \"Longdogs\", whose tracks were chosen by asking members of the duo's internet forum Longdogs to choose their favourite track from each of their albums via a poll.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2094955", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2094955", "title": "Salience (language)", "text": "Salience (language)\n\nSalience is the state or condition of being prominent. The Oxford English Dictionary defines salience as \"most noticeable or important.\" The concept is discussed in communication, semiotics, linguistics, sociology, psychology, and political science. It has been studied with respect to interpersonal communication, persuasion, politics, and its influence on mass media.\n\nIn semiotics (the study of signs or symbolism), \"salience\" refers to the relative importance or prominence of a part of a sign. The salience of a particular sign when considered in the context of others helps an individual to quickly rank large amounts of information by importance and thus give attention to that which is the most important. This process keeps an individual from being overwhelmed with information overload.\n\nMeaning can be described as the \"system of mental representations of an object or phenomenon, its properties and associations with other objects and/or phenomena. In the consciousness of an individual, meaning is reflected in the form of sensory information, images and concepts.\" It is denotative or connotative, but the sign system for transmitting meanings can be uncertain in its operation or conditions may disrupt the communication and prevent accurate meanings from being decoded.\n\nFurther, meaning is socially constructed and dynamic as the culture evolves. That is problematic because an individual's frame of reference and experience may produce some divergence from some of the prevailing social norms. So the salience of data will be determined by both situational and emotional elements in a combination relatively unique to each individual. For example, a person with an interest in botany may allocate greater salience to visual data involving plants, and a person trained as an architect may scan buildings to identify features of interest. A person's world view or \"Weltanschauung\" may predispose salience to data matching those views. Because people live for many years, responses become conventional. At a group or community level, the conventional levels of significance or salience are slowly embedded in the sign systems and culture, and they cannot arbitrarily be changed.\nFor example, the first thing seen in a poster may be the title or picture of a face.\n\nThe noun \"salience\" derives from the Latin word \"saliens -\" ‘leaping, or bounding’. In a human embryo, the heart tissue is beating and leaping. A Native American may pay no attention to Columbus Day protests until after instruction in tribal and historical Indian traditions (priming). After gaining new cultural insights, these protests may become \"salient.\"\n\nSalience, as a component of Communication and Social Psychology studies, asks the question of why something captures and holds our attention and why it is more readily available as a cognition than other facts, feelings, and emotions? When a person perceives and reacts, they use the information and emotions most readily accessible. This information is understood to be the most salient information. \nSocial Influence is an area of intense study for Social Psychologists and Communication theorists. Social Influence asks how and why, are people influenced to weaken a strongly held position, adopt a new position, change an attitude, or persuade someone? The extent that the communicator can understand and harness the power of Social Influence is the extent that they can succeed in their goal.\n\nSalience has been identified as one of the key ideas that guides our understanding of how to make a point of view stand out from among others and draw the receivers attention to the salient points of the encoded message. Salience is then an important concept in several theories relating to Social Influence. Some areas of Communication and Social Psychology research that include the concept of salience as a component of their theory are: Persuasion Theory, Vested Interest, Summation Theory of Attitude Change, Group Salience, and Social Presence Theory. The use of salience in these theories is summarized below:\n\nPersuasion theory: Salience is the critical concept, along with agenda and spin, for the Persuasion theory of Professor Richard E. Vatz of Towson University as articulated in his book, /The Only Authentic Book of Persuasion/, (Kendall Hunt, 2012, 2013). Salience, in his book and articles, is used as a measure of how reality is created for chosen audiences. He claims (1973) (2013) that the struggle for salience (and agenda and meaning and spin) is the sine qua non of the persuasive process.\n\nVested interest (communication theory): William Crano's states that, \"Vested Interest refers to the extent to which an attitude object is hedonically relevant for the attitude holder\" (Crano, 1995, p. 131). In order for someone to have a vested interest in something, it must be perceived to affect their lives personally. Things that in which we are highly vested also bear on our behavior (Crano, 1995), and it must be salient or leap out. Vivid cues are more likely to grab our attention (McArthur & Post, 1977). If an attitude object is salient to us, our vested interest will be increased as well as the likelihood that our behavior and attitudes will be consistent (Sears & Citrin, 1985).\n\nCrano states, \"Apparently, making an attitude object more salient enhances the salience of attitude-relevant outcomes as well. Vividness, priming, and similar operations may all enhance the salience of the self-interest implications of a position.\" (Crano, 1995, p. 131). The stronger the salience of our attitude, the stronger will be the connection between our attitude object and our behavior.\n\nAttitude Summation Theory: Fishbein posited that we have many beliefs about an attitude object (characteristics, attributes, values, and etc.). Each belief held is argued to have an affective (feeling) and evaluative (value determining) component. An attitude is then a mediated evaluative response (Fishbein, 1963). These attitudes sum together to form our overall view of the attitude object and comes to the forefront (made salient) when we engage the attitude object.\n\nFishbein indicates that we can hold six to nine salient beliefs at a time (Cronen, 1973). Those manifested during the attitude object encounter determine the prevailing attitude. Fishbein believed that the strongest held beliefs would be the most salient and come to the fore. Cronen argued that salience is not intrinsically tied to strength, but is an independent attribute of attitude change, as some strongly held beliefs are non-salient (Cronen, 1973).\n\nGroup Salience: Group salience is a person's cognizance of fellow group members similarities and differences within a group interaction (Harwood et al., 2006). Within a group, communication is the primary way that we determine salience of attitudes. Other things such as physical attributes can be observed, but deeper feelings will have to be communicated within the group to make them salient (Harwood et al., 2006). Coupland et al., suggest that communication processes represent an individual's identity within the group (Coupland et al., 1991).\n\nSocial presence theory (SPT): SPT can be defined as, \"The degree to which a person is perceived to be a real person in mediated communication.\" (Gunwadena, 1995) This is an update on the original definition, developed by Short, Williams and Christie (1976), which stated, \"The degree of salience of the other person in an interaction.\"\n\nWhat makes something salient? How does the mind select, structure and impart meaning to stimuli? People \"develop and stabilize\" cognitions about stimuli by an \"examination of action, intention, ability and environment.\" (Taylor & Fiske, 1978, citing Heider, 1934, as their source, p. 250). Individuals have limited cognitive resources and abilities to process and comprehend information and situational complexity. A person cannot grasp every nuance of a stimuli required to assign its full and complete meaning. Salience is the way researchers understand what information will most likely capture one's attention in a given situation and have the greatest influence on one's cognitions about the stimuli. Research has shown that the most salient information is not always the most accurate or important, but a \"Top of the Head Phenomenon\" (Taylor & Fiske, 1978). People are not fully conscious of the extent to which salience affects them. In experimental studies, individuals generated strong cognitions with only slight manipulation of stimuli. When shown this fact, the participant reacted strongly to the idea that they made choices based on \"trivial\" information (Taylor & Fiske, 1978).\n\n\"Salience has generally been treated as a propriety [conforming to standard norms of morality and behavior] of a stimulus which allows it to stand out and be noticed\" (Guido, 1998, p. 114). Guido developed the Theory of Dichotic Salience after a review of some 1,200 studies, which pointed to a \"common origin among salience instances, by emphasizing the nature of prominence which is intrinsic to any salience construct\" (Guido, 1998, Abstract, p. 114). According to this theory, a stimulus is \"in-salient\" if it is not in harmony with perceiver's worldview. It is \"re-salient\" if it is in harmony with the perceiver's goals (Guido, 1998).\n\nSalience is a construct that depends on the ability of the mind to access the feelings or emotions (affect) generated by the salient stimulus. The activation in memory of cognitions that relate to and evaluate the stimulus. And finally, the availability of these mental resources to engage the stimulus (Guido, 1998).\n\nA schema (psychology) is a cognitive framework or concept through which one organizes and interprets information. Schemas provide shortcuts in sorting and interpreting the enormous quantity of information generated in one's environment. The limitation of such a construct, is that it may cause one to exclude pertinent facts and feelings about a situation. Instead one may focus on only those that harmonize with one's biases, beliefs and ideations.\n\nSchemas are very useful as they help one to decide about things with very little information. This simplification filters how one allocates cognitive resources. It also allows one to learn more readily and rapidly, if the learning fits within an already established schema. A schema allows for quick access to stored cognitions and filtering through pre-established algorithms, which saves time in processing and retrieving information. Because they are so useful and reliable in helping one make sense of the world, schemas can be hard to change. Thomas Kuhn (1962), in his book, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, talks about how scientists, considered the most rationale and fact driven professionals, can be so committed to their schemas that they ignore or misinterpret relevant data gathered from experiments that is contrary to their notions. One challenge for communicators is to find a way to break through these hardened perceptions in order to persuade. Making an idea salient is one of the keys.\n\nGuido's Principle one is figure-ground, which is the means the perceptual field from which people direct their attention towards something that stands out. Figurality is the brightness, complexity, and energy (movement) of a stimulus. It is thought that these aspects trigger cognitions and thought processes in the brain that lead to salience. Brightness includes the magnitude and the colors of the object. Studies have shown that bright, vibrant colors more easily capture the attention and are easier to remember (Guido, 1998).\nComplexity builds upon the contextual factors (the number of perceptible qualities about the stimulus object that one can distinguish) and learning (what we perceive as unfamiliar). Complexity is the interaction of the familiarity, unfamiliarity, and the number of aspects of the stimulus object that we can resolve. Complexity is the interaction of these stimuli interact to engage affect and cognitions developed about the object (Guido, 1998). Movement of an object engages sensory receptors, which when sparked, send stimuli to the body and brain. Moving pictures, signs and eyes are used to capture our attention and make us pay attention (Guido, 1998).\n\nNovelty is the \"isolation\" of the stimulus from other stimuli (objects). This isolation or uniqueness sets it apart from other objects in the background, so that it can be noticed (Guido, 1998). This can also be expressed as comparative distinctiveness (Higgins, 1996).\nGuido's Principle two is Unusuality, which can be broken down into statistical novelty (unique and unfamiliar), unexpectancy, out of role behaviors, negativity and extremity (emotional impact). Novelty is the degree that one has no experience with the stimuli. Unexpectancy is a result of learning. We have developed an expectation that is violated (Guido, 1998). Negativity is our gut reaction. Extremity is the emotional impact of the Negativity. Each of these contributes to making something salient.\n\nAccessibility and Salience. When we evaluate a situation, what comes first to our minds? The things that come to mind are those that are most accessible (most readily recalled and those that are most salient (Kreech and Crutchfield, 1948). Our beliefs and thoughts vary in salience. Salient beliefs are most easily activated in the cognitive processes and are more easily recalled, and are therefore more accessible (Higgins, 1996).\n\nSalience is determined by stimuli, such as brightness, contract, situational properties, schemas, expectations, arousal, and properties of the interpreter (e.g., need state, enduring beliefs, and motivations). The interconnectedness of these stimuli causes the brain to be activated and information salient to the situation recalled and acted upon.\n\nInformation stored in memory, that is accessible, can be recalled either by a cue or free association. Information that is not accessible, cannot be recalled and therefore is not available for use in interpreting a situation. Higgins (1996) defines a memory's activation potential as having three properties: 1. the possibility that the knowledge can be recalled (not repressed or lost), 2. how easily accessible is it, and 3.the intensity or the energy of the memory. To the extent that memories are available, accessible, and have sufficient effect is the extent that these memories will be activated and that knowledge is brought to bear on the situation at hand.\n\nCramer (1968, p. 82) defines priming as \"a change in antecedent conditions which is specifically designed to increase the probability of a particular response given to a particular stimulus\". The process of priming can activate a particular memory to bring it to the fore so that it can be engaged in a communication or social influence situation. Priming has been shown to increase accessibility of relevant knowledge (Higgins, 1996). Priming is, then, any event that causes increased accessibility and availability of a framework of knowledge (schema) useful for that particular situation.\n\nIn journalism, priming is associated with framing. When an author writes an article to persuade, he or she frames certain information so that it is more salient to the reader (Weaver, 2007). Framing including writing decisions about definitions of words and events, causal linkages, moral implications, and solution sets for the problem area (McCombs, 1997). Our minds sort information available using our agenda (framing) and stimulus (priming) for that situation and activate it to accomplish our purpose.\n\nWhen one encounters a stimulus for the first time, the initial reaction is characterized as unconditioned response. An unconditioned response is one that \"elicits a national, reflexive response.\" (Weseley & McEntarffer, 2014, p. 136). Subsequent encounters will elicit a conditioned response has been developed through the learning that occurred with the intervening encounters with the stimulus. This learning is bedrock knowledge on which one draws when responding to a given situation. (Weseley & McEntarffer, 2014). If the first time one ate ice cream the experience was pleasant, the second experience will be informed from the firs. The second experience will generate salient pleasant cognitions, salivation, and other biological responses that will reinforce the pleasant salience of the experience. If on the other hand, the first encounter was negative (disgust, pain or nausea), the second encounter will generate the feeling of pain in the stomach awful memories of the first encounter. which will reinforce the negative salience of the first and second experience.\n\nAnother key aspect of whether a particular memory or knowledge will be activated is whether it is applicable to the situation. If it is not applicable, it will not be salient and is unlikely to be activated for that situation. \"According to the synapse model…, the process begins with the stimulus, which increases the excitation level of stored knowledge as a function of the features of the match between the attended features of the stimulus and the features of the stored knowledge.\" (Higgins, 1996, p. 137). The stimulus information creates a pathway to the knowledge, which is then evaluated for a salience match to the stimulus. If there is a match, then the knowledge will be activated.\n\nOur minds and bodies are bombarded by relevant and irrelevant knowledge and experiences every day. We will tune into salient ones (crane the ears to more fully hear enjoyable music) and tune-out non-salient ones (cover our ears from jackhammer noise). There is difference between seeing something and looking at it. In seeing, the capacity of our retina to take in the light energy is engaged and the brain processes that information into an image. When one looks at an object, not only are visual perceptive capacities engaged, but other mental processes for evaluation and ordering of the object are activated (Skinner, 1974).\n\nHumans have gatekeeper mental mechanisms that allow certain information in and keeps others out. This discrimination process can be viewed a defensive mechanism the protects and enhances our life experience. Our processes of making cognitions \"also involve contingencies of reinforcement.\" (Skinner, 1974, p. 117). Skinner implies that reinforcement as \"a special kind of stimulus control.\" (Skinner, 1974, p. 119). Salience can be thought of as a reinforcement mechanism that make certain thoughts, feelings and emotions available, accessible, applicable and actionable within the context of the situation.\n\nEsber and Haselgrove (2011) looked at the use of predictiveness and uncertainty on stimulus salience. They cite the example of a bird watching the water for the presence of fish. Through learning, the bird associates the ripples with the closeness of the fish, but they must be careful of the uncertainty that ripple is not caused by a crocodile. The ripples are very salient, if they are caused by fish suitable for use as food. The likelihood increases that the ripples will catch the attention of the bird and improve its probability of eating the fish, if the ripple cue is a predictor of fish behavior and presence. The predictiveness of ripples reinforces its salience. The Esber–Haselgrove model argues that (1) \"stimuli acquire added salience to the degree that they predict motivationally relevant consequences\", and (2) \"a predictor of multiple reinforcers should have more salience than a predictor of just one.\" (Esber & Haselgrove, 2011, 2555-25557). So, for example, if ripples predict both the presence of fish and the increased likelihood that the fish can be caught, they will be much more salient to the bird, than if the ripples only predict the presence of the fish, but tell the bird nothing about the probability of making a catch.\n\nSalience is a broad concept in the social sciences, that can cause confusion. Part of the confusion lies in that different researchers use the same term to posit different ideas of what makes a particular stimulus salient. When we encounter an object or idea, we may be draw to it for a variety of reasons. It may be its brightness or intensity, its predictive capacity, or other features such as uniqueness or enormity that catches one's attention.\n\nOnce the attention is engaged, our brain will begin to process this information and make assessments and judgements about the encounter. Our minds and bodies will activate useful memories, biological responses and feelings that were generated from prior encounters with the object of similar objects. These memory-evaluative-feeling-biology responses will determine if the object is salient. If it is salient, we will devote more cognitive processing resources to the encounter and it will enhance or protect us in that moment.\n\nCommunication scholars have found that a number of different factors have a direct effect on the salience of attitude objects.\n\nWilliam Crano posits that one's direct experience with an issue or attitude object increases the salience and consequently the potency of that attitude, and the level of consistency between attitude and behavior.\n\nThe concept called \"vested interest\" by Crano is called \"self-interest\" by Sears (1997). It seems that \"self-interest\" is the more widely recognized term. Self-interest involves either perceived or actual personal consequences. That is, Crano (1997) argues that vested interest involves perceived personal consequences (p. 490), while Sears (1997, a critique of Crano) counter-argues that Crano's survey experiments define it objectively. Crano argues that vested interest should have a moderating effect on attitudes. Sears argues that, actually, evidence for this is conflicting: The survey literature has rarely found significant effects of self-interest, while the experimental literature finds significant effects. The literature is concerned with salience only marginally; it is actually about strength of attitudes (i.e. how well they correlate with behavior). It is about salience inasmuch as anything \"strong\" is \"salient\".\n\nThe salience (prominence) of an attitude can also be measured by the relevance of an idea to that person's needs or aspirations. As ideals become more salient they become more accessible, the more accessible the attitude object is the stronger the attitude toward the object. As accessibility increases, so does the likelihood of self-interested voting (Young).\n\nPolitical scientists agree that salience is relatively important in examining political policy, because policies are not only determined by what issues are important to people but also by how important they are. This involves examining what issues are ignored and which are made \"important.\" One research agenda that political scientists are concerned with understanding is \"when and how salience and changes in salience matter for political action.\"\n\nThere are three related understandings of salience.\n\n\nMcCombs and Shaw’s seminal \"Chapel Hill study\", which researched salience and public opinion examined most of the agenda-setting research since the 1968 United States presidential election which has been concerned with how the public salience of the issue is related to mass media’s ranking of these issues in terms of frequency of coverage and news play. The main hypothesis examined in this study is the ranking of certain issues by the media, which, in time, becomes the public agenda. More importantly, the article searched whether the perceived public salience of the federal budget deficit is significantly related \"to the amount of public knowledge about the issue, direction of public opinion regarding one possible solution to the issue, the strength of that opinion and political behavior such as writing letters, signing petitions, voting, etc.\" The result of this study concluded that \"even though the federal deficit issue was one of the more salient to newspaper and voters during the 1988 election, it (the federal budget deficit) was not as emotional or dramatic as some of the other highly salient issues such as drug abuse or environmental pollution. Thus it seemed likely that public opinion regarding a solution to the federal budget deficit might be rather evenly split and would likely be more stable during the month of interviewing than would opinion on some of the other more dramatic issues being emphasized in news media coverage and political advertisements.\" In other words, issues that directly involve subjects, in this study, would conclude to be more salient than issues that do not involve them directly.\n\nAlthough salience is a stimulus response, is it a stimulus quality or an absolute quality? Salience plays an important role in intergroup communication. According to Harwood, Raman and Hewstone, \"Group salience is a key variable both in influencing quality of intergroup contact and in moderating the effects of intergroup contact on prejudicial attitudes.\"\n\nIn their study of family communication and intergroup relationships, \"Group salience is an individual’s awareness of group memberships and respective group differences in an intergroup encounter (e.g., the salience of race in an interracial conversation).\" This study carefully examines the dynamics of intergroup relationships with respect to communication in a family context. Their study involved communicative aspects associated with age salience in the grandparent – grandchild relationship, the extent to which various dimension of communication predicts measures of salience, relational or inter-family proximity, and attitudes towards aging. According to Harwood, Raman and Hewstone, \"Communication phenomena that were positively correlated with measures of age salience were negatively related to relational closeness. Only one communication measure (grandparents talking about the past) moderated the relationship between quality of contact with grandparent and attitudes toward older people. Specific communicative dimensions emerged that warrant further investigation in this and other intergroup contexts.\"\n\nSalience also from an applied communicative perspective plays an important role in our Consumer- Marketing world. In Gianluigi Guido's book, \"The Salience of Marketing Stimuli: an incongruity – salience hypothesis on consumer awareness\", \"salience triggered by an external physical stimuli, like all marketing stimuli are before being internalized by consumers – to explain and predict the conditions under which a marketing stimulus, is able to achieve its communication outcomes in term of processing and memory.\" The book clearly defines the history of the definition of salience and the ambiguities of arriving at an accurate definition. It also utilizes various theories to best define salience in our marketing world. Of the many theories, Guido uses aspects of Incongruity theory, Schema theory and an information processing model referred to as the In-salience hypothesis emphasizes the nature of prominence of salience.\n\nMarketing plans have become quite intricate and detailed in many ways. Analysts and industry experts used a myriad of tools to collect information from would be customers, previous customers and others in order to fashion the sales message of a particular product. This level of detailed work has evolved over time, but in many ways the same resources and information are gathered and used to achieve result of a sale. The marketing strategy feeds into one of the final products most people get to experience: the commercial. The commercial embodies the elements of the marketing strategy in language, affective response, and attitude change. Marketing plans in the modern age also look at the international customer when creating plans and formulating strategy. \"An evolutionary perspective of internationalization of the firm has been adopted by a number of authors in the areas of international economics and international management. The theory of the international product lifecycle, propounded by Vernon and others, identifies a number of phases in the internationalization process based on the location of production. In the initial phase, a firm exports to overseas markets from a domestic production base. As market potential builds up, overseas production facilities are established. Low cost local competition then enters the market, and ultimately exports to the home market of the initial entrant, thus challenging its international market position.\"\"This model is part of wider Dichotic theory of salience, according to which a stimulus is salient either when it is incongruent in a certain context to a perceiver's schema, or when it is congruent in a certain context to a perceiver's goal. According to the four propositions of the model, in-salient stimuli are better recalled, affect both attention and interpretation, and are moderated by the degree of perceivers' comprehension (i.e., activation, accessibility, and availability of schemata), and involvement (i.e., personal relevance of the stimuli). Results of two empirical studies on print advertisements show that in-salient ad messages have the strongest impact in triggering ad processing which, in turn, leads to consumer awareness.\"The field of marketing is continually being studied and researched. Anshular & Kumar, Williams & Schmidt, Holden, Kuznetsov & Whitelock, and Huang & Chan have researched and published works regarding the language of marketing. Although the research is ongoing and adaptive to the customer, the research has been able to study points of importance to the consumer. Marketing requires an approach that carefully designs messages (commercials), utilizing signs and symbols to resonate with a potential buyer or customer. Nike's swoosh, Michael Jordan's jump-man image, Ford/GMC Cadillac logos are all signs that most people can quickly grab and discern the message being laid out. In the world of marketing having this power and ability lends a significant edge in comparison to the competition. Van Der Lans, Pieters, and Wedel write based on their research: \"We estimate brand salience at the point of purchase, based on perceptual features (color, luminance, edges) and how these are influenced by consumers’ search goals. We show that the salience of brands has a pervasive effect on search performance, and is determined by two key components: The bottom-up component is due to in-store activity and package design. The top-down component is due to out-of-store marketing activities such as advertising.\"Using computer based langue to design extraction tools as part of the user experiences. Language errors that exists in projects can be passed on and further create issues for the next group. From this view issues to be fixed, ID’d and solutions set up to combat such issues. In the IT world, coding language is very important and therefore errors must be monitored well throughout the process.\n\nInternet Alcohol Vendors unlike traditional brick and mortar stores are established to reach a wider market. With this intent state officials and competitors have both started cases in court as further regulating the practice of internet alcohol sales. Internet sales give buyers reduced discounts in many forms while offering very little in security and accountability. The case brought against the industry favored further regulation keying in on individuals underage age having access to and buying alcohol online. The courts pushed back against the plaintiff lacking substantial information to make the case. The marketing language used was focused on reduced taxes based on quantity purchased and reduced or zero fees for shipping. Customers were connected to this message and therefore drawn to the product and made significant purchases.\n\nRussian viewpoint of marketing focused on the battle against capitalism, the west and specifically USA. Marketing language focused on the economics of each nation and how to improve it in an ever-changing world. Marketing was studied in the west by Russian students and translated for Russians to understand. Bad language came from translators who took artistic leisure with the material. Based on this context things were changed and missed when information was being relayed created huge shifts in understanding of the original material.\n\nThe difference between the English alphabet and Chinese logographical system offer a unique challenge in brand creation, marketing and language. The article touches on how unique messages have to be crafted without simply translating. The Chinese language and system of writing is over 35,000 years old and not as easily bent or flexed to make easily pronounced phrases both in sound and linguistic prowess. Marketing in china is affected my culture and language equally. Crafting an effective strategy requires adherence and understanding of all factors.\n\nTherefore, to define salience as appropriate as possible using the information, it would be apt to define it such that, salience is that intrinsic concept of the perceived or interpreted prominence of an attitude, and its manifestation on our choices.\n\nSalience in marketing based on the research reviewed, can be categorized as a stimulus quality. What that means is the customers’ needs have to be calculated and adjusted towards through the entire planning and execution of the plan. The overall goal of the messenger should be to create a message which adapts to the customer's affective responses, rewarding it with more info, then finally providing a product which would best arrive at the predetermined feel. Most consumers when asked about a marketing campaign are able to identify it clearly from the point of view of a commercial. These commercials capture the essence of the message being sent to all recipients. Products such as make up, cars, clothing, coffee, food, shoes etc. are all designed to create and provide an affective reaction from the recipient. The process of engaging with the customer seeks a cognitive connection. Customers will have to be grouped based on the item in order to predict affective responses. With this in mind, the focus is placed on imagery, affective responses from the consumer. How does this make you feel, do you empathize, how would you feel about using this product, etc. Marketing messages that have a significant affective component are able to connect better with people and yield greater outcome.\n\nIdentity salience can affect the consumer. This display can be explain using \"Identity theory posits that identities are arranged hierarchically and that salient identities are more likely to affect behavior than those that are less important. We propose that identity salience may play an important role in relationships that are distinguished by a minimum of two characteristics. First, though most theoretical and empirical research in relation-ship marketing focuses on characteristics of successful business-to-business relationships, such as trust and commitment (Morgan and Hunt 1994), many exchange relationships involve individuals. It is not unusual for organizations to attempt to develop long-term relationships with consumers on an individual basis. We argue that in contexts in which one partner is an individual, for example, business-to consumer marketing, identity salience may be an important construct that mediates relationship-inducing factors, such as reciprocity and satisfaction, and relationship marketing success.\" Identity gets tied to brands, products and places for some people. There are generations of family sports team supporters, airline users, vacation goings and even restaurant patrons. These key items become a foundation block of self-identification and perception.\n\nThe vehicle industry uses certain symbols as part of its marketing campaign. Most of these are touched on from different manufacturers in their efforts to win over customers. These are also common messages points that are used to make the sale and acquire the vested interest of the customer. For e.g. comfort (leather seating), roominess (cabin space), reliability, safety, performance, on/off-road handling, award winner by category, insurance companies or other entity. The best part of all the campaign is the dealership experience. This experience is the affective piece of the process. The initial being cognitive and schema connection, followed by the affective which aims at nudging the customer towards affirming the purchase. Customer attitudes can be influenced by a myriad of variables, therefore the marketing campaign is aimed at skewing enough of those variables towards to nearest dealer or once most capable of making the sale. \"Specifically, research on behavioral synchrony suggests that people express greater feelings of attraction when they share their visual gazes, body postures (Chartrand & Lakin,2013), and more recently, their language style in writing or speech (Ireland & Pennebaker,2010).\"\n\nSalience as a stimulus quality is a significant piece of the marketing, sales and commercial strategy. Manufacturers use celebrities, athletes, and other professionals as a way of drawing your attention to their product through stimulus. When it comes to car buying, many people refer to a past memory, this stimuli is different with each person but overall the quality and richness of that response is what connects to the brand in a way nothing else does. Care makers go through periods of recycling pieces of nostalgia to connect new drivers to those of yesteryear. Granpa is able to drive his mustang next to a grandson who favors the new model with a few modifications. A suit maker is able to dress members of the same family for 3 generations and just as many weddings and formal events.\n\nThe stimulus quality is the strongest connection between all these events and the company or product creator able to take advantage of this, is most likely to achieve success. \"Research concerning stimulus characteristics, which include information content and format, suggests that consumers utilize more nutrition information when it Is presented in an easily processed form (Levy et al. 1985; Muller 1985; Russo et al. 1986; Scammon 1977).(Moorman, 1990)\" Stimulus qualities continually change and therefore needs to be studied and adaptations made in order to attain the best marketing end results. Cultural viewpoints of marketing and advertising is important across industries in many parts of the world. In the US alcohol sales are restricted to individuals ages 21 and greater, that rule isn't universal and some in nations around the world are trying to cope with the effects of marketing and ad campaigns (O’Brian & Carr 2016).\" Marketing messages are important based on the roles of the recipient. In the example of a mom she’s expected to judge the quality of goods and purchase based on the needs of children even though the good may not directly be marketed to and for her. \"Noting the incongruence between the self-interested, utility maximizing persona one is expected to portray in the workforce, and the selfless, nurturing persona widespread among mothers, Hays argues that the latter identity in fact reveals a deep-seated cultural ambivalence towards economistic principles and behaviours.\"\n\nle form schema based on social norms and roles. These roles are enforced individual beliefs and boosts perceptions is supposed to be doing, sometimes those expectations hold true and in others it doesn't. Social identity theory has been used while creating marketing strategies regarding women. Marketing strategies with products aimed at women should have like minds as part of the planning and creative process. Women across cultures and backgrounds experience similar stimuli but not on the same wave. Products like shoes, makeup, clothing and others geared specifically for women have messages focused on stimuli response of \"feel good\". Moms receive and are sent messages of safety and security of their children, a measure of style and the look and presentation of a strong woman. Marketing towards men are designed to inspire the feel of strength, leadership, vision, connection to nature, and feeling of ruggedness.\n\nThe Language used in marketing is important because it is potentially the most important reason why someone makes a purchase/acquires a product. Research has shown that analytics aren't always the best predictor of sales or consumer connection with a product. Social identity theory can be used to evaluate the roles of individuals while creating the strategy. Depending on this solely will lead one astray without the addition of other pieces of information. Shema allows the consumer to receive each detail of a commercial/ad campaign in a way that energizes particular stimuli and therefore puts each person into the \"driver seat\" of an experience.\n\nThe cognitive perspective spells out information which must be received, processed and analyzed and solutions south. Salience in marketing searches for the affective or stimulus response. A combination of efforts which both harvests information and processes it carefully if very important. Things such as age group, buying power, shopping frequency, socioeconomic status are all important. Once a product is created and during its testing phase the response which users and customers alike will be its feel. In the new age of tech data, appliances and complex machinery, marketing will still need to focus its efforts on such products and how consumer stimuli reacts to the product. The best engineers can create something that's amazing with all its bells and whistles, but its up to the perception of the customer to evaluate its usefulness and fit into his/her lifestyle.\n\nThe growing tech industry with the power of achievement is quickly advancing virtual reality. VR can be experienced in the home without leaving to try or test any product prior to purchase. \"The mural isn't just about aesthetics. Visitors will be instructed via signs to download an app to view the mural's augmented reality features. Downloading the app will also unlock a special coupon at The Elephant Room. It's a marketing tactic that Moody believes can drive foot traffic to the bar.\" With this power marketing analysts and executives can craft messages and commercial aimed at each person with a unique and authentic feel. Information and data points are being collected and tested now. Video games offer a chance into the virtual world medical training and some groups in government and the military are adopting the technology to better achieve results. Crafting the message and spreading it out the masses will take less effort in the future, messages can be adapted to fit all manner of permutations each person may have. There may finally be an era of error free messaging with a direct link into the internet, show rooms of fashion designers, engineers at car factories and all other sorts of products. Testing in the virtual world would be far less tasking on legions of people.\n\nHumans in general respond greatly to stimuli and we offer this through the reactions generated. Marketing lends help in this manner by studying the patterns of behavior and crafting products for sale. The messaging is not always clear, succinct, and wide reaching. Research is still ongoing regarding how best to reach the customer in order to pitch and complete a sale. Those who are successful have crafted tools to help measure key things like salience in messaging and reaction to products. In the new age, the data collected will be very important while outfitting each member of the consuming public. Being able to craft a message or medium that can quickly adapt to each person virtually is of great importance. Online markets are gaining followership daily as more money spending moves to the digital realm. Perception and reception of the message is still the single most important part of any marketing strategy and should not be treated lightly.\n\n\n"}

It is designed to accept different tools depending on the required function.\n\nThe following are various tools that can be used in the air hammer:\n\n\nFree-standing air hammers are an adaptation of the hand-held version. An air hammer can stretch or shrink (shape) a variety of metals, from thin aircraft aluminums, all the way down to 10-gauge steel. They are also used for smoothing metal that has already been roughed, shaped or formed.\n\nIn the 1920s, two pneumatic devices were invented that would permanently change the way metal and stone were hammered. The pneumatic rivet gun was originally developed to set hot rivets on girder bridges and high steel buildings. This tool was later scaled down for sheet metal, as the 1930s saw the advent of monocoque aluminum aircraft. The other new device, hitting at twice or three times the speed of the rivet gun, was the stone carver's hammer – a great blessing for smooth and rapid dressing of granite and marble.\n\nIn 1930 F.J. Hauschild adapted the original stone carver's hammer into a portable hand-held steel tube frame for the purpose of straightening auto bodies. For the next 25 years his \"Ram's Head Body and Fender Machine\" improved and increased production for auto body work men all over the U.S. Copying Hauschild’s patented design, a pneumatic tool company in Chicago marketed a number of \"destined-to-be-classic\" pneumatic planishing hammers, both hand-held for auto body work, and also free-standing ones, with a variety of throat depths for industry and manufacturing.\n\nBy World War II, rivet guns were used widely in U.S. aircraft factories both for riveting aluminum sheets, and for flow forming, the process of working aluminum sheet into and over wooden forms by the application of the pneumatic rivet gun.\n\nPost-war industry brought many new applications for the \"air hammer\" technology. Among these were:\n\nEach of these tools has a different purpose despite nearly identical appearance in many cases.\n\n"}
{"id": "2094965", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2094965", "title": "Glory Daze (film)", "text": "Glory Daze (film)\n\nGlory Daze is a 1995 American independent comedy film written and directed by Rich Wilkes and starring Ben Affleck, Sam Rockwell, Megan Ward, and French Stewart. It also features John Rhys-Davies, Alyssa Milano, and Spalding Gray in supporting roles. The plot concerns five college housemates in Santa Cruz, California who are facing graduation and make an attempt to prolong their carefree lifestyle before going their separate ways. Matthew McConaughey, Meredith Salenger, Matt Damon, Brendan Fraser, and Leah Remini all appear in minor roles. Music for the film was composed and selected by members of the punk rock band The Vandals, and the soundtrack features several punk rock bands of the era.\n\n22 year-old Jack Freeman is graduating from the University of California, Santa Cruz with a degree in art, and is hurting from a recent breakup with his ex-girlfriend Dina. He shares a house called \"El Rancho\" with four friends: Rob is also graduating, and preparing to move to Los Angeles with his girlfriend Joanie, though he is worried about settling down and living so close to Joani's mother. Dennis is a perpetual student with three degrees who, after six years at UCSC, is moving on to an MBA program in Michigan. Mickey is a cartoonist with a year of college still to go, and has feelings for their friend Chelsea but is too shy to reciprocate her affections. Josh, aka \"Slosh\", had a promising academic future but failed out of college in favor of a life of drinking and working a series of menial jobs.\n\nArt professor Luther criticizes Jack's final sculpture project for expressing an uninteresting, suburban, middle-class worldview, but praises Dennis' thesis—a photo-essay of Slosh getting drunk and working at dead-end jobs—and offers him an apprenticeship; Jack suggests that this is only because Luther has a homosexual attraction toward Dennis, a notion Dennis dismisses. Not wanting their college days to end, Jack convinces his friends to postpone their respective plans and stay at El Rancho for another year. They celebrate the decision by throwing a party, at which Chelsea, tired of her feelings for Mickey going unrequited, makes sexual advances toward Jack. He turns her down, and she leaves the party embarrassed. Rob gets into an argument with Joanie, causing her to leave angrily.\n\nAfter the commencement ceremony the next day, Rob reconciles with Joanie and meets her mother, and they end up getting along. Jack argues with his parents over his future, and they leave abruptly. Jack encourages Mickey to pursue a relationship with Chelsea. Luther makes a pass at Dennis during a faculty luncheon, confirming Jack's suspicion about his ulterior motives. Dennis and Jack vent their frustrations with Luther by cutting down a totem pole that his sculpture students spent two semesters creating.\n\nAt a beach bonfire that night, Slosh tells Jack that it was Jack's carefree attitude that inspired him to give up on college, and that he does not regret his decision because he no longer fears what the future may hold. At Slosh's encouragement, Jack attempts to win back Dina, but she rebuffs him. Back at El Rancho, Mickey admits his feelings to Chelsea, and the two share a kiss. Jack and the others realize that they should not really stay another year, that it is time to move on with their adult lives. To preserve their memories of the house and prevent any future residents from despoiling it, they proceed to smash their furniture and belongings, culminating in the destruction of the bar counter that they had built together.\n\nThe next day, the five friends go their separate ways: Rob leaves for Los Angeles with Joanie, Dennis heads off to school in Michigan, and Mickey and Chelsea begin dating. Slosh moves in with a group of new students he has befriended, and hangs the El Rancho sign on their house. As Jack leaves town, he stops at a restaurant where Dina is eating with her new boyfriend, and writes \"angst for the memories\" on the window as a farewell message to her.\n\n\nAffleck, Rockwell, Ward, and Stewart received top billing for the film, both in the billing block and opening credits, while Rhys-Davies, Milano, and Gray are listed as \"special appearances\". The theatrical film poster, however, advertised Affleck, Milano, and Stewart as the film's stars. Meredith Salenger is also credited with a \"special appearance\" as a fan of Mickey's comic strip. Several actors who later became stars in their own right had small roles in \"Glory Daze\", including Matthew McConaughey as a rental truck salesman, Matt Damon in a non-speaking role as former El Rancho housemate Edgar Pudwhacker, and Brendan Fraser and Leah Remini as a couple who Jack argues with on a bus. Other small roles were played by Sean Whalen as a flunky, Jay Lacopo as the bus driver, and Alfred Sole as a fisherman.\n\nThe musical score for the film's soundtrack was composed by Warren Fitzgerald, guitarist of the punk rock band The Vandals. Vandals bassist Joe Escalante served as music supervisor, along with Lia Vollack. The Vandals performed original music for the film score, including the \"Theme from \"Glory Daze\"\" which plays during the opening credits. \"It's a Fact\", from their then-upcoming album \"The Quickening\", was included, and a music video was later released for the song featuring clips from the film. The soundtrack also features several other contemporary punk rock bands, mostly from California, including NOFX, Bad Religion, Tilt, The Mr. T Experience, Assorted Jelly Beans, The Bouncing Souls, and the New Bomb Turks.\n\nMembers of the cast and crew also contributed to the soundtrack. The song \"Sports Pack\" is sung by Vinnie DeRamus, who played Mickey, with writer and director Rich Wilkes on drums along with bassist Scott Marcano and a guitarist credited as \"Gold\"; for the soundtrack album they used the group name Epoxy. In the film's party scene, the El Rancho housemates' band perform two songs: The \"Dudes of Steel Theme\" with Rob singing, and a cover version of The Mr. T Experience's \"Now We Are Twenty-One\" with Slosh singing. Sam Rockwell and Vien Hong sang their respective characters' parts on these tracks (DeRamus also sang backing vocals on \"Now We Are Twenty-One\"), while the music was performed by Daniel Rey, Roger Murdock, and John Connor.\n\nThe soundtrack album for \"Glory Daze\" was released by Kung Fu Records, Escalante and Fitzgerald's recently launched independent record label. The album includes two songs not used in the film: \"Joe Lies (When He Cries)\" by The Bouncing Souls, and the previously-unreleased Vandals song \"Change the World with My Hockey Stick\". Also, rather than the original Bad Religion version of \"We're Only Gonna Die\" used in the film, the album substitutes a live recording of a cover version performed by Sublime. Other songs used in the film but not included on the soundtrack album include \"Kill All the White Man\" by NOFX, \"Clown Show\" by Ednaswap, \"She Ballin by Chappie Chap, and \"Acetone\" by Mudhoney.\n\nReviewing the film in November 1995, when it was titled \"Last Call\", \"Variety\" senior critic Emanuel Levy criticized Wilkes' direction as \"awkward, lacking any visual flair\" and said that \"the movie makes its funny points early on, which means the second half is basically an elaboration. If the loose, anecdotal pic sometimes rambles and loses its main line, eventually it rights itself, with enough inventiveness and fresh, nasty humor to compensate for the dull moments.\" Upon its theatrical release, Stephen Holden of \"The New York Times\" gave \"Glory Daze\" a positive review, saying \"This tiny nostalgic comedy, with its smart collegiate chatter, is a much better movie than slick fatuities like \"\" (1995), \"Airheads\" (1994), and \"Billy Madison\" (1995), for which Mr. Wilkes wrote the screenplays. Of course that isn't saying much. But \"Glory Daze\" deftly sketches each member of its underachieving fivesome while sustaining a mood of humorously frazzled end-of-semester anxiety [...] Mr. Affleck's affably mopey performance finds just the right balance between obnoxious and sad sack. Even though he thoroughly deserves every comeuppance, you still have to sympathize with the poor guy.\"\n\nEdward Guthmann of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" gave the film a negative review, saying that it \"doesn't cover any ground that wasn't already plowed and sprayed in previous slacker comedies\" and that \"there's no shape to the movie and no rhythm connecting the scenes to each other. Wilkes has a gift for nasty put-down lines, but his directing debut lacks heart and his leading man isn't a tad sympathetic – or even slightly redeemed by Affleck's sour performance.\" Barbara Shulgasser of \"The San Francisco Examiner\" was also critical of it, calling it \"another cynical movie about people in their 20s who don't know what to do with their lives [...] Writer-director Rich Wilkes doesn't insert much substance into the movie, but he does take the opportunity to make fun of art education. Jack's professor (John Rhys-Davies) tells him Jack's project has gotten 'lost in abstractionism'. 'Real art is subject to a complex filtration system', he goes on. 'I look at your stuff and I see 20th century American suburbia. It doesn't resonate.' Just the way I feel about this movie.\" Joey O'Bryan of \"The Austin Chronicle\" also criticized \"Glory Daze\", calling it \"insipid [...] a loving, if not particularly funny, tribute to the slob-comedies of the Eighties, or, in other words, it's an \"Animal House\" (1978) wannabe with a condescending Gen-X slant [...] the film's sense of social satire is hopelessly pedestrian, the dialogue stale ('He changed his major more often than his underwear'), and the editing is amateurish, with many scenes beginning too late and ending too early.\"\n\nReviewing the DVD release of the film in 2002, Keith Phipps of \"The A.V. Club\" compared it unfavorably to 1995's \"Kicking and Screaming\", calling it \"a considerably weaker variation on the same themes [...] \"Glory Daze\" is not a good movie, but it does illustrate some of the frustrating clichés that the Gen Angst genre has accumulated in the nearly four years since \"Reality Bites\" (1994) appeared.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2094972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2094972", "title": "Rudelsburg", "text": "Rudelsburg\n\nThe Rudelsburg is a ruined hill castle located on the east bank of the river Saale above Saaleck, a village in the borough of Naumburg in the county of Burgenlandkreis in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. The Rudelsburg was built in the Middle Ages by the Bishop of Naumburg and served to secure trade routes such as the Via Regia through the Saale Valley.\n\nThe Rudelsburg was a point of conflict between the bishops of Naumburg and the Margraves of Meissen belonging to the House of Wettin. The castle occasionally served various noble families as a residence, until it was destroyed in the Thirty Years' War and thereafter fell into disrepair. In the early 19th century the Rudelsburg became a popular tourist destination thanks to the romanticisation of mountains and the rise of hiking as a pastime. From 1855 onwards it achieved national renown as the annual meeting place of the \"Kösener Senioren-Convents-Verband\", the oldest union of student fraternities with delegates from all German-speaking countries. The Rudelsburg still maintains a particular attraction for visitors and lies on the Romanesque Road (Ger:\"Straße der Romanik\"), a tourist route.\n\nRudelsburg sits atop a rocky shell limestone ridge, approximately above the river Saale and above Saaleck, a suburb of Bad Kösen in the Burgenlandkreis district in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Since 2010, the area has been part of the municipality of Naumburg.\n\nArchaeological finds seem to indicate that an early Bronze Age settlement existed on the site of the Rudelsburg, which has been attributed to the Unetice culture. The discovery of the Nebra sky disk attracted public attention to this prehistoric civilisation and its elevated culture and provoked interest in the settlements in the region of Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia. The political, religious and economic importance of such settlements has not yet been established, but is the focus of intense research.\n\nThe Rudelsburg castle was established in 1050 as a border fortification and was extended around 1150, with the addition of the central and outer keeps. Not far away on the western knoll is the ruin of Saaleck Castle. Rudelsburg was officially mentioned for the first time in 1171 under the name Rutheleibisberg.\n\nHeinrich III, Margrave of Meissen, received the castle from the Bishop from Naumburg in 1238 as recompense for services to the church and installed there a number of families belonging to the nobility of service (retainers to a lord whose status was far above that of the peasantry but who nonetheless did not belong to the ranks of the high nobility). A source from 1271 names 12 different castellans. A priest is mentioned for the first time in 1293.\n\nDuring a dispute with the noble Curtefrund, the citizens of Naumburg led by their captain Johann von Trautzschen laid siege to the Rudelsburg from 22 April to 30 July 1348. The sources relate that an \"“instrumentum”\" was brought to bear during the siege that could shoot Greek fire. This must have been some early form of gunpowder and is thought to be one of the first records of the use of firearms in a siege in Germany. The only earlier recorded use of ordnance dates back to the siege of the town of Meersburg on Lake Constance by Ludwig von Bayern in 1334. The oldest reports in all of Europe are from Italy (Florence 1326, Cividale 1331) and from the French fleet (1338-1346).\n\nThe citizens of Naumburg burnt down the Rudelsburg during their siege, and there were deaths and injuries on both sides. It seems that the castle was not rebuilt, as it is not mentioned in any official document for several decades after this event.\n\nThe next mention of the castle dates to 1383, when the Schenk family from Saaleck belonging to the House of Vargula are named as masters of the citadel, seated in Rottelsburg.\n\nA loan certificate of the Dukes of Saxony, who belonged to the House of Wettin, dated 2 April 1441 names the brothers Rudolf, Günther and Heinrich von Bünau as the owners of the Rudelsburg. Apparently they owned no land other than that on which the castle stood.\n\nDuring the fratricidal war between Friedrich and Wilhelm of Saxony, the Rudelsburg was besieged and destroyed for a second time in 1450. The inner keep was burnt to the ground during this incident.\n\nAt the division of the lands of the House of Wettin in 1485, the Rudelsburg was attributed to the Albertine line.\n\nRudolph von Bünau auf Teuchern and Günther von Bünau auf Gröbitz sold the Rudelsburg and the surrounding outworks to Hans Georg von Osterhausen in 1581 to cover their debts. The castle, which had been barely maintained until then, began to fall into decay during this period.\n\nAlthough Groitzsch still describes the Rudelsburg as \"arx pulcherrima\" (\"most beautiful castle\") in his 1585 work \"Descriptio Salae fluvii eidemque adjacentium urbium, arcium etc.\" (\"Description of the river Saale and the surrounding towns, castles, etc.\"), a record from 1612 indicates that the lord marshal of Osterhausen employed a stonemason and a carpenter to provide \"necessary support of the sagging beams, girders and rafters\".\n\nAccording to Osterhausen court records, a process was held at the Rudelsburg on 4 June 1616. At the time, a caretaker still lived in the castle, which was accessible via a narrow road. The courtyard was covered in grass. Besides a small room with a wooden pulpit, the usable remains of the castle included the dungeons with their very strong doors.\n\nTowards the end of the Thirty Years' War in 1640, Swedish troops set fire to the Rudelsburg. Following this third destruction, the Rudelsburg was abandoned on 14 April 1641 and the inhabitants moved to the nearby Kreipitzsch property.\n\nThe nobles from Creutz(en) are believed to have been the owners of the Rudelsburg from 1671 to 1771. In 1690, they tried to establish the status of the (uninhabited) castle as a possession owing direct allegiance only to the emperor (\"Reichsunmittelbarkeit\") in a court process in the imperial court in Wetzlar.\n\nIn 1770, the owner of the Rudelsburg ordered that the walls of the outer keep be torn down in order to reuse the stones for construction on the property, but a worker was permanently injured in an accident, and this was interpreted as a bad omen. The work was stopped. The outer keep was almost completely destroyed at this point in time, and it is probably only as a result of this accident that the ruined inner keep was preserved.\n\nWith the death of Friedrich Adolph von Creutz in 1774, the male line of the family was extinguished. This thwarted the plans to establish the \"Reichsunmittelbarkeit\" of the Rudelsburg.\n\nIn the following years, the counts from Zech and the counts from Brühl are named briefly as the owners of the Rudelsburg. The family von Schönberg bought the castle in 1797 and established an entailment, i.e. an indivisible trust that was designed to keep together the inheritance of the family.\n\nIn the 19th century, the Rudelburg became a meeting point for romantically-minded hikers, especially for students from Jena, Leipzig and Halle.\n\nBy this time, the castle was desolate, and devoid of all infrastructure. There was no entrance into the courtyard of the central keep and there were no sealed rooms, just rubble and debris. In 1818, the cantor emeritus, Johann Friedrich Förtsch, described the Rudelsburg as follows:\n\n“The inner courtyard is covered in the rubble of the various ceremonial halls, chambers, weapon and storage rooms, kitchens, underground vaults, cellars and corridors, which have collapsed. It is thus impossible to say how everything used to be arranged.”\n\nNonetheless, ever more visitors came to the Rudelsburg. During the same period, the masters of the castle belonging to the family of the barons von Schönberg planted grapevines on the southern slope of the hill. One of the former vineyard workers, Gottlieb Wagner, known as “Samiel”, began to look after the ruins. From 1824 onwards, he offered food and drink from the Kreipitzsch property to visitors.\nFranz Kugler, a student from Stettin studying in Berlin, composed the famous song \"An der Saale hellem Strande\" (On the bright bank of the Saale) whilst resting at the castle during a hike along the river in 1826:\n\nIn this song, the castles on the Saale are decaying ruins that serve only to inspire the imagination. There is as yet no mention of drinking and celebrations or of the Rudelsburg as a venue for events.\n\nThe attractiveness of the castle rose however with the services offered by Wagner, so much so that the head of the district authorities in Naumburg asked Friedrich von Schönberg, the owner of the property, if it would be possible to open it officially for visitors. Consequently, a road was even built up to the castle.\n\nGottlieb Wagner opened the first tavern in the castle in time for Easter 1827, although it was only open on Sundays at first. When word got around about this development amongst the students in Jena, they marched on the Rudelsburg and, cheering loudly, occupied it for three days. The owner of the castle was honoured with a torchlight procession.\n\nThe completion of the Thuringian Railway in 1849, which improved the access to the Rudelsburg, coupled with the gastronomic offerings, further increased the attractiveness of the castle and brought in visitors from further abroad, including for example students from Leipzig and Halle an der Saale.\n\nDuring a large-scale Prussian military exercise in the area in 1853, the provincial classes invited King Frederick William IV to breakfast at the castle. The drinking hall in the inner courtyard, which was built in the same year, is probably a product of this visit. The hall took the form of a roofed seating area that was open to the courtyard and replaced the old straw roof that had been held up by simple tree trunks.\n\nIn 1863, Hermann Allmers from Rechtenfleth near Bremen composed the student song \"Dort Saaleck, hier die Rudelsburg\" (There Saaleck, here the Rudelsburg). Although Allmers was himself not a student, he traveled with students in the Saale valley, and his song speaks of the new life within the walls of the castle.\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century, the Rudelsburg became a regular meeting point for students’ corps, whose umbrella organisation the \"Kösener Senioren-Convents-Verband\" (KSCV) had been founded in Jena in 1848, making it the oldest union of German student fraternities. The site of the KSCV’s annual meeting was soon moved to Bad Kösen, and a meeting took place in the Rudelsburg for the first time in 1855. From this time until World War I, the Rudelburg served every year as a social meeting point during the annual meeting in Bad Kösen.\n\nIn 1867, following the celebration of the 800th anniversary of the restoration of the Wartburg, discussions began as to whether the Rudelsburg should also be restored. These discussions were further provoked by a storm in December 1868, which brought down parts of the perimeter walls. Work to restore the perimeter walls in the west and in the south began in 1870. The partial reconstruction of the castle began a year later under the leadership of the master builder, Werner, from Bad Kösen, using plans drawn up by the royal building officer in Saxony, Oskar Mothes. During these works, the entrance and the bridge were repaired. The knight’s hall with its staircase and side room were restored. A large breach in the wall was closed in the north-eastern corner and windows were cut in the old northern wall. A canon that had been captured in the 1870-71 Franco-Prussian War was placed on the bridge. These works were complete by Easter 1872.\n\nIn 1872, the first monument erected by members of the students’ corps was unveiled. The \"Gefallenensäule\" (English: Pillar to the Fallen) was established in honour of those members who had fallen in the Franco-Prussian War. The Emperor William I Obelisk was unveiled in 1890, followed in 1896 by the Young Bismarck Memorial. The last of this first round of monuments was erected in 1926 in honour of those who fell in World War I.\n\nThe partial reconstruction by Mothes, the founding of the German Empire in 1871 and the erection of the monuments in the area near the outer keep marked a completely new phase in the history of the Rudelsburg. While youthful appreciation of nature and the romantic scenery had been pivotal in the first half of the century, the Rudelsburg now became a symbol for the members of the KSCV. The KSCV was a strong ally of the state, which was reinforced by the membership of both of the most important political decision-makers of the time, Otto von Bismarck and Emperor Wilhelm II. With the founding of the \"Verband Alter Corpsstudenten\" (English: Federation of old members), the KSCV, which had until then only counted students amongst its members, had a new source of income in the form of contributions from the “old men”. The Rudelsburg became a platform for celebrations of the KSCV’s new self-confidence. As a consequence, the annual meeting at the Rudelsburg became more sedate and ceremonial. Speeches held at the monuments and patriotic songs were fixtures in the annual Pentecost programme in the German Empire.\n\nIn the Empire and the Weimar Republic, life-size copies of the Rudelsburg monuments were made and sold to interested buyers in Germany and Austria. In 2007, these laboriously produced objects are still to be found from time to time in antique shops.\n\nIn 1913, Paul Schreckenbach wrote the historical novel \"The last Rudelsburger\", which is set in the 14th century and which reflects the conservative Prussian values of his time.\n\nThere were no student meetings at the Rudelsburg during World War I, but the tradition was restarted after the end of the war. In 1926, the \"Löwendenkmal\" (English: Lion Monument) was unveiled with great pomp. This ceremony was seen as a symbol of the members of the students’ corps attachment to the old imperial system and was reported throughout Germany and beyond.\n\nThe last meeting of the KSCV at the Rudelsburg before World War II took place in 1934. The 1935 congress ended with the dissolution of the group by the National Socialists.\n\nDuring World War II, there were efforts at some universities to re-establish individual student bodies in secret. These were to include the umbrella organisation, the KSCV. To this end, a meeting was organised at the Rudelsburg in 1944, which ended with a ceremonial drinking session. Because of the chaos in the last months of the war, neither this new founding nor the attraction of the Gestapo’s attention had serious consequences for those involved.\n\nAfter the end of World War II, the Rudelsburg was part of the Soviet occupation zone and later the German Democratic Republic (GDR). The owner, a member of the nobility, lost his possessions, and the castle was attributed to the town of Bad Kösen.\n\nThe student organisations which found themselves on the territory of the GDR moved to the west. The KSCV’s congress was held from 1954 to 1994 in Würzburg, near to the Fortress Marienberg. The Rudelsburg and Bad Kösen were but a memory for the members of the students’ corps.\n\nThe Rudelsburg decayed further during this time, as did the monuments that had been erected there. Some larger metal pieces were melted down and reused.\n\nAs it was common to take the names of tourist attractions to designate products produced in a particular area, the name “Rudelsburg” was used to name a car radio produced in the state-owned radio factory in Halle and various products produced in the equally state-owned limestone factory in Bad Kösen.\nThe first attempts to revive the old student traditions began in the GDR in the 1960s. Much however had already been forgotten, and information and materials first had to be collected in secret. In the early years of the 1980s, the first new fraternities in the GDR were founded, at first secretly and then ever more openly. The Rudelsburg and other traditional meeting points featured in the plans of the GDR students.\n\nOn 20 June 1987, the fraternity \"Salana Jenensis\" organised the first ceremonial drinking session of the GDR student fraternities at the Rudelsburg. At the first such meeting, just 19 participants were present, some of whom had arrived by using rafts or bath tubs made of zinc to travel along the Saale. This was to be a reference to the tradition of boat trips on the Saale which can be seen in many old depictions. This ceremonial drinking session was the first officially registered traditional student meeting in the history of the GDR.\n\nFrom this year on, the Rudelsburg was the annual meeting point for the student fraternities which had been founded in the GDR before 1990. In 1990, they joined together in the Rudelsburg Alliance.\n\nIn 1990 (sometimes even before German Reunification), the first student bodies began to return to their old university towns in the GDR. The first congress took place in Bad Kösen in 1995. The Rudelsburg was once again put to use for this purpose, which required extensive work to restore the castle. Bad Kösen’s infrastructure also had to be upgraded, for the congress was now much larger than it had even been before the war.\n\nThe monuments at the Rudelsburg have also been successively restored since unification. These works have been financed by the KSCV, with donations from individual student bodies, but also with donations from individual members.\n\nThe song \"Dort Saaleck, hier die Rudelsburg\" is still used by members of both the KSCV and the Rudelsburg Alliance.\n\nThe Rudelsburg still hosts a restaurant. The inner area of the castle and the donjon are accessible during the opening hours of the restaurant and visitors have a view of the Saale valley from the donjon. In the lower rooms of the donjon, there are display windows with exhibits about the student organisations.\n\nSo that weddings may take place there, there is a civil registry office in the castle. The town Bad Kösen and the surrounding districts now market the castle as part of the “Thuringian Toscana”, including the nature reserve Saale-Unstrut-Triasland.\n\nThe Rudelsburg was constructed in the Middle Ages with a central ward divided into several sections and surrounded by an outer ward. The stones of the outer ward were largely reused in the 18th century and it is no longer recognisable; only parts of the wall in the east and south are still there. The outer ward was unusual to the extent that it was built higher up than the central ward was.\n\nThe central ward, which was separated from the ward keep by a deep encircling ditch, has a bergfried that is approximately high, a transverse rectangular great hall, several living quarters, and is surrounded by a circular wall. The courtyard is very small.\n\nThe Romanesque bergfried is almost exactly square () and is topped with a pyramid-shaped tower roof made of stone, which gives the castle its characteristic appearance. There is a dungeon in the basement of the donjon.\n\nThe outer palisades in the east were constructed in the 13th century, the other palisades and the circular corner towers were constructed in the 15th century. The Rudelsburg palisade, which is located between the central and outer keeps, was obviously envisaged during the construction of the castle and is seen as proof that the idea of palisades did not first arrive in Europe as a result of the Crusades.\n\nBecause of its position atop a steep cliff above the Saale, the western side of the castle was the hardest to attack. It is protected only by the circular wall and the great hall is also located on this side.\n\nThe northern circular wall was not built on the very edge of the cliff, in contrast to the practice elsewhere in Europe. This was presumably done so as to avoid the wall collapsing if a section of the fragile limestone were to break off. The wall is set back about , which made the later addition of an advanced corner tower on the north-east side necessary in order to prevent potential enemies from advancing onto this ledge.\n\nThe southern side, which is only protected by a small valley, has an additional palisade, which is flanked by two corner towers. The strongest corner tower is on the south-east side. The eastern side looks to the outer keep and is protected by the ditch, a palisade and the donjon.\n\nAt some point in time, a windmill was attached to one of the round castle towers. The windmill is shown in many depictions of the castle until the middle of the 19th century. It was destroyed by fire in 1864.\n\nIn the course of time, many monuments have been erected at the Rudelsburg. Four important monuments have been put up just by the KSCV on the way from Bad Kösen to the Rudelsburg on the land formerly occupied by the outer keep.\n\nThe \"Kösener Gefallenendenkmal\" (Pillar to the Fallen) was erected at Pentecost in 1872 in honour of the members of the students’ corps who had fallen in the 1870-1871 Franco-Prussian War. The students put up this monument without the help of the “old men”, whose federation had not yet been founded, and the Pillar was in fact the first monument ever erected by students in Germany. It consisted of a base with stairs, a platform with balustrade, a four-metre tall pedestal and a pillar topped by an imperial eagle with a crown. The monument was destroyed in 1953, under the GDR.\n\nThe \"Kaiser-Wilhelm-Obelisk\" (Emperor William I Obelisk) was unveiled on 25 May 1890. It honours the German Emperor, who died in 1888. It too was destroyed under the GDR, but was rebuilt following the reunification.\n\nThe Young Bismarck Monument was the first project to be realised by the \"Verband Alter Corpsstudenten\". It was erected in 1895-96 to commemorate the 80th birthday of Otto von Bismarck, himself an “old man” of the Corps Hannovera Göttingen. Of the countless Bismarck monuments erected in Germany, this was the only one that depicted the first Imperial Chancellor as a nonchalantly seated young man with the sash of his fraternity across his chest and a duelling sword in his hand. This portrayal of Bismarck in a casual stance provoked heated discussions, but had been approved by Bismarck himself on 27 April 1895. It is the work of sculptor Norbert Pfretzschner. This monument was destroyed under the GDR by the Free German Youth, but the foundation stone with inscriptions and Bismarck’s student hat was saved by members of East German student fraternities and handed over to the KSCV after Reunification. On 29 May 1998, members of the Corps Hannovera Göttingen paid for a memorial to be erected on the site of the old Bismarck monument.\n\nA reproduction of the original monument was unveiled by the KSCV on 1 April 2006 in the presence of the Justice Minister of Saxony-Anhalt, Curt Becker. Andreas Belser from Traunstein was the responsible sculptor and the casting had been carried out by the firm Otto Strehle in Winhöring near Altötting. Many members of the Corps Hannovera who had been involved in the realisation and financing of the reproduction were present at the ceremonial unveiling of the monument. The monument has however already been damaged by souvenir hunters or vandals.\n\nThe \"Löwendenkmal\" (Lion Monument) was erected in 1926 in memory of the 2,360 members of the KSCV who had fallen in World War I. It shows in relief an oversized lion that has been pierced with lances and is dying.\n\nThe Lion Monument was created by (1875–1958), a sculptor from Berlin. After the Reunification, the overgrown monument was restored and new plaques in memory of those who fell in both World Wars were added.\n\nThe Alliance Stone was erected at the Rudelsburg in 1997 by members of the Rudelsburger Alliance to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the first official meeting of student fraternities in the GDR. An earlier stone made of concrete had been placed next to the Bismarck Monument in 1987. This “Old Alliance Stone” is still in its original place.\n\n\n"}

Axel's cousin Paul (Vincent Gallo) coaxes Axel from his job tagging fish in New York City to Arizona to attend his uncle Leo's (Jerry Lewis) trophy wedding to a much younger woman (Paulina Porizkova). His uncle tries to persuade him to stay permanently and take over the family business of selling Cadillacs. Axel resists at first, but he decides to give it a try.\n\nAxel encounters two strange women: Elaine (Faye Dunaway), a woman who always had a dream of building a flying machine, and her stepdaughter Grace (Lili Taylor), who is jealous of Elaine and dreams of killing herself and being reincarnated as a turtle. Axel starts lusting after Elaine and decides to help make her dreams come true. As he and Elaine build the machine day by day, Grace starts destroying the contraption. Axel then rebuilds. Leo and Paul arrive at Elaine and Grace's house to encourage Axel to come back, but Elaine threatens them with a shotgun. Axel and Elaine complete the machine and test it, but it crashes in a tree.\n\nAxel then decides to put both Elaine and Grace out of their misery, but can not go through with it. Grace has the idea to play Russian Roulette with him. Axel is scared at first, but at his second turn he pulls the trigger multiple times. The gun does not fire. Axel, Elaine, and Grace come to Paul's talent show. He decides to play Cary Grant's role from \"North by Northwest\" with the famous crop duster scene. Paul receives the score of 1. Leo's fiancée then approaches them to say that there is something wrong with Leo. Axel realizes that Leo is dying and calls an ambulance but Leo passes away.\n\nThe day before Elaine's birthday a few months later, Axel and Paul finally come back to Elaine and Grace's house. Elaine is mad at Axel for not contacting her but forgives him. The next day on Elaine's birthday, Elaine is given an airplane as a present. The four celebrate Elaine's birthday by beating a piñata, but are interrupted by a storm. As the others dry off inside, Grace remains outside to free her turtles, telling them to \"Go play,\" Axel goes upstairs with Grace to wrap the presents where she gives Axel a globe, telling him that she wants him to have the world. Axel tells Grace that Elaine has changed and that he is not in love with her any more. He makes a promise to Grace to go to Alaska.\n\nAxel, Elaine, Grace, and Paul talk about the manners in which they want to die. Grace says that she is going to sleep and walks upstairs, dressing herself in a white shift and a hat with a veil. As she walks outside, Axel and Elaine see her through the window and run outside in an attempt to stop her. Grace shoots herself, and a lightning bolt destroys Elaine's airplane.

Many of them were originally part of The Dead End Kids, and several of them later became members of The East Side Kids and The Bowery Boys.\n\nThe urban drama \"Dead End\" became both a successful play and a hit movie, featuring six young actors playing streetwise guttersnipes: Billy Halop, Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, Gabriel Dell, Bobby Jordan, and Bernard Punsly. The troupe became known as The Dead End Kids and starred in a series of features for Warner Brothers.\n\nIn 1938, Universal borrowed the Dead End Kids (except Gorcey and Jordan) for a juvenile-delinquency drama called \"Little Tough Guy\". Universal adopted this as a brand name, and turned the film into a series of 'Little Tough Guys' features. The studio filled out the cast with David Gorcey (Leo's younger brother) and Hally Chester. \n\nThe next three films did not include any of the original Dead End Kids. \"Little Tough Guys in Society\" (1939) was more of a lightweight comedy, while the next two, \"Newsboys' Home\" and \"Code of the Streets\" (1939), were more dramatic. Jackie Cooper starred in \"Newsboys' Home\", but was not a member of the team. Only David Gorcey and Hally Chester remained from the first film, \"Little Tough Guy\". This was the beginning of the members of the team changing on almost a film-to-film basis. Eleven actors drifted in and out of the series, including Frankie Thomas, Charles Duncan (who was originally hired to play Leo Gorcey's role in the play \"Dead End\"), and Billy Benedict. \n\nWhen Warners released Bobby Jordan from his contract, Universal quickly signed him to join the rest of gang. Now, with five of the original six Dead End Kids on the payroll, Universal revised the billing to read \"The Dead End Kids and Little Tough Guys\". In total, the Little Tough Guys made 12 feature films, and three 12-chapter serials. Leading player Halop joined the armed forces and was replaced by Jordan for the final film in the series, \"Keep 'Em Slugging\", released in 1943.\n\nShemp Howard of the Three Stooges appeared in \"Give Us Wings\", \"Hit The Road\" and \"Keep 'Em Slugging\". Huntz Hall cited Howard as a major influence when his later \"Bowery Boys\" series shifted to all-out slapstick comedy.\n\nThere was still a market for these tough-teen films, and most of the Little Tough Guys principals wound up at Monogram Pictures as The East Side Kids and The Bowery Boys.\n\n\n\n"}

Much of this extension is now known as Northwest Territories Highway 3, the Yellowknife Highway. The stretch from Enterprise to Hay River is Northwest Territories Highway 2.\n\nIn approximately 1970, the highway was extended west from what is now the southern terminus of Highway 3 to reach Fort Simpson, and in 1971, when the section to Fort Simpson was opened to traffic, work began to prepare a road grade from there to Wrigley, but the work was abandoned. This roadway, which starts at a junction from the island that \"downtown\" Fort Simpson is situated on, was finally made usable in 1994, and includes the N'dulee ferry and ice crossings.\n\nOn November 8th 2013, the portion of the highway from the Alberta/Northwest Territories border to Enterprise was designated the Highway of Heroes.\n\nThere are social and economic studies being done on the extension of the highway north from Wrigley to join the Dempster Highway; the N.W.T. government has completed 34 bridges across all but six of the widest river crossings, serving the ice road and awaiting the all-weather route.

{"id": "2095002", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2095002", "title": "Patience Worth", "text": "Patience Worth\n\nPatience Worth was allegedly a spirit contacted by Pearl Lenore Curran (February 15, 1883 – December 4, 1937). This symbiotic relationship produced several novels, poetry and prose which Pearl Curran claimed were delivered to her through channelling the spirit of Patience Worth.\n\nPsychologists and skeptics who have studied Curran's writings are in agreement that Patience was a fictitious creation of Curran.\n\nCurran was born Pearl Lenore Pollard in Mound City, Illinois. The family moved to Texas when she was eight months old and she started school when she was six. She was an average but uninterested student, eventually dropping out in her first high school year, later stating she had a nervous breakdown due to the strenuous academics. She later returned to classes at St. Ignatius Catholic school.\n\nCurran was sensitive about her looks, considering herself to be ugly. She admitted to having little imagination and few ambitions, except to be successful as a singer. She had a short attention span and read very little during her formative years.\n\nHer family moved to St. Louis when she was 14. She made a last attempt at attending school but was discouraged when placed in a lower grade based on her academic skills. However, she took music lessons, trained in piano and voice, and aspired to be a prima donna. About that time the family moved again, to Palmer, Missouri. As Curran's musical talents blossomed, she was sent to Kankakee, Illinois for voice training, before moving to Chicago for tuition from J.C. Cooper. She worked at the McKinley Music Company addressing envelopes for $6 a week, then the Thompson Music Company selling music. From the age of 18 to 24 she worked at assorted jobs in Chicago during winter months, and during the summer she taught music at home in Missouri.\n\nPearl married John Howard Curran when she was 24. Though by no means wealthy, they lived a lifestyle which gave Pearl free time for moviegoing or playing cards with her husband or neighbors. The Currans had an average education for that time and owned few books; neither of them had traveled extensively. The first seven years of their marriage were uneventful.\n\nBeginning in July 1912, Pearl Curran and her friend Emily Grant Hutchings were making a call on a neighbor who had a ouija board and during that call there came what purported to be a message from a relative of Mrs. Hutchings. Mrs. Hutchings then bought a ouija board and took it to Mrs. Curran's house with the idea of continuing the communications. Pearl was somewhat indifferent and had to be coaxed to participate at the board. On June 22, 1913 a communication from \"Pat-C\" began to come through. Then on July 8, 1913 the board seemed to be possessed with unusual strength and supposed communications from Patience Worth began. \"Many moons ago I lived. Again I come. Patience Worth my name. Wait, I would speak with thee. If thou shalt live, then so shall I. I make my bread at thy hearth. Good friends, let us be merrie. The time for work is past. Let the tabby drowse and blink her wisdom to the firelog.\" When asked when she lived, the dates 1649–94 were given and that her home was \"Across the sea\".\n\nAlthough Worth indicated that she was from England, she never named the town or village in which she lived. She did give some clues which were deduced by Casper Yost and other intimates of the Currans to indicate that Patience Worth had lived in rural Dorsetshire with her father John and mother Anne. Curran had a mental picture of the place in which Patience Worth lived indicating that Patience lived in \"...green rolling country with gentle slopes, not farmed much, with houses here and there. Two or three miles up this country on this road was a small village ---few houses.\" Mrs. Curran then visualized Patience leaving for America on a huge wood, three-masted schooner. Patience was described by Mrs. Curran as \"...probably about thirty years. Her hair was dark red, mahogany, her eyes brown, and large and deep, her mouth firm and set, as though repressing strong feelings. Her hair had been disarranged by her cap, and was in big, glossy, soft waves.\" Mrs. Curran also saw Patience \"sitting on a horse, holding a bundle tied in sail-cloth, tied with thongs and wearing a coarse cloth cape, brown-gray, with hood like a cowl, peaked. The face is in shadow. She is small and her feet are small---with coarse square-toed shoes and gray woolen stockings.\" After a long voyage the ship arrives at the jagged coast of America, where they could find no landing place for the ship. They launched several flat boats. According to Mrs. Curran, Patience was standing in the prow of her boat and became one of the first to reach the shore. Patience Worth was later to indicate that she was eventually killed by the Indians.\n\nIn 1916, in a book with a foreword written by Casper Yost, editor of the \"St. Louis Globe-Democrat\", Henry Holt and Company publicized Curran's claims that she had contacted the long dead Patience Worth. Curran claimed she began to anticipate what the Ouija board was going to spell and by 1919 the pointer would just move aimlessly about the board. Curran described pictorial visions which accompanied Patience's words. She said \"I am like a child with a magic picture book. Once I look upon it, all I have to do is to watch its pages open before me, and revel in their beauty and variety and novelty...When the poems come, there also appear before my eyes images of each successive symbol, as the words are given me...When the stories come, the scenes become panoramic, with the characters moving and acting their parts, even speaking in converse. The picture is not confined to the point narrated, but takes in everything else within the circle of vision at the time...If the people talk a foreign language, as in \"The Sorry Tale\", I hear the talk, but over and above is the voice of Patience, either interpreting or giving me the part she wishes to use as story.\" Pearl Curran went on to describe her association with Patience Worth as \"one of the most beautiful that can be the privilege of a human being to experience.\" Pearl and Patience together wrote several novels including \"Telka\", \"The Sorry Tale\", \"Hope Trueblood\", \"The Pot upon the Wheel\", \"Samuel Wheaton\", as well as several short stories and many poems.\n\nThe Patience Worth writings coincided with a revival of Spiritualism in the United States and Britain, possibly facilitating interest in the matter. Skeptics derided certain aspects of the supposed communication, noting particularly that Patience was able to write a novel about the Victorian age, an era some 200 years after the one in which she claimed to have lived. Still, the literature produced was considered to be of a high quality by some. For instance, the literary critic William Marion Reedy considered \"The Sorry Tale\" to be a new classic of world literature. Patience Worth was also listed as one of the outstanding authors of 1918 by The Joint Committee of Literary Arts of New York. She was also cited by William Stanley Braithwaite in the 1918 edition of the \"Anthology of Magazine Verse and Year Book of American Poetry\" by printing the complete text of five of her poems, along with other leading poets of the day including William Rose Benet, Amy Lowell, and Edgar Lee Masters. Braithwaite's index of magazine verse for 1918 listed the titles of eighty-eight poems by Patience Worth that appeared in magazines during the twelve-month period, only two of which were considered by Braithwaite to be lacking in any distinction. The same index listed ten poems by Amy Lowell and five by Edna St. Vincent Millay.\n\nAfter the death of her husband John Curran on June 1, 1922 who kept meticulous records of the Patience Worth sessions, the record of the Patience Worth sessions became episodic and fragmentary, with long gaps of time unaccounted for. Pearl was pregnant with her first child which was born six months after her husband's death. Pearl now had a family of four to support by herself and her financial situation so bleak that Herman Behr, a devoted friend, sent money to Mrs. Curran and announced that he would continue to do so as long as she needed it. Mr. Behr provided Mrs. Curran with an income of $400 a month for a number of years. Mrs Curran then entered the lecture circuit to make some money to support her family. A few months later, her mother Mrs. Mary Pollard died. The sessions with Patience Worth still continued regularly at Mrs. Curran's home. Mrs. Curran's financial situation continued to be bleak. She married two more times, but both marriages were short-lived. In the summer of 1930, Mrs. Curran left St. Louis for good and moved to California to live with an old friend Mrs. Alexander Bailey \"Dotsie\" Smith in the Los Angeles area. Patience was kept busy at the sessions, as always, by requests for her comments on major topics of the day and other issues. She continued to communicate through Pearl until November 25, 1937, when she gave her final communication. Pearl had apparently received a prior communication from Patience that she (Pearl) was going to die as Pearl told Dotsie Smith \"Oh Dotsie, Patience has just shown me the end of the road and you will have to carry on as best you can.\" Even though Pearl had not been in ill health, she developed pneumonia late in November and died on December 3, 1937.\n\nIn 1916, Casper Yost published \"Patience Worth: A Psychic Mystery\". In the book, he did not come to any definite conclusion but considered the case of Patience Worth to be inexplicable by any naturalistic theory. He was open to the spiritualist hypothesis. A thorough investigation of the case was conducted by the psychic researcher Walter Franklin Prince, who published in 1927 his book \"The Case of Patience Worth\", which was a voluminous report of 509 pages covering the Patience Worth case from its inception in 1913 to about 1927, published by the Boston Society for Psychical Research. It provided a biographical sketch of Pearl Curran, eye-witness reports, opinions and reviews, poetry of Patience and Mrs. Curran, and much other information related to the case. Prince concluded his investigation by stating, \"Either our concept of what we call the subconscious must be radically altered, so as to include potencies of which we hitherto have had no knowledge, or else some cause operating through but not originating in the subconsciousness of Mrs. Curran must be acknowledged.\"\n\nThe parapsychologist Stephen E. Braude has examined the case of Patience Worth and concluded that Pearl Curran was probably a highly gifted child whose talent for writing was smothered by her mother, who wanted to force Pearl into a singing career. In the alter ego of Patience Worth, her subconscious could revive that talent. Braude has written \"there is little reason to think that the evidence supports the hypothesis of survival. Although Patience offered various clues regarding her origin and identity, subsequent investigation revealed nothing to indicate that a Patience Worth ever existed.\" Braude also considered the possibility of \"super-psi\": the view that Curran had subconsciously utilized a form of extrasensory perception to gather information.\n\nIn 1914 Curran travelled to Boston to be tested by the psychologist Morton Prince. Curran used the Ouija board at his home on two occasions but refused to be put under hypnosis because she believed that it would destroy her contact with Patience Worth. Morton told reporters \"nothing of scientific importance\" occurred and \"I consider the results inconsequential and of no scientific value\".\n\nIn 1919, Charles E. Cory Professor of Philosophy at Washington University in St. Louis published a paper titled \"Patience Worth\" in the \"Psychological Review\" which came to the conclusion Patience Worth was a subconscious personality of Curran. In 1954, William Sentman Taylor a specialist in abnormal psychology also explained Curran's mediumship by psychological factors.\n\nThe psychologists Leonard Zusne, Warren H. Jones in their book \"Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking\" (1989) have written:\n\nIn 2011, the psychologist Richard Wiseman wrote:\n\nIn 2012, the researcher Joe Nickell who published an article in the \"Skeptical Inquirer\" said he spent five hours studying Curran's writings at the Missouri Historical Society in St. Louis. Nickell concluded:\n\nIn 1916 the psychical researcher James Hyslop wrote that the whole case for Curran's mediumship was based on fraud. Hyslop in the Journal for the American Society for Psychical Research claimed Curran had known people from the Ozarks who spoke a dialect reminiscent of Patience Worth and Curran's husband had studied Chaucer and educated her on the subject. According to Hyslop the case of Patience Worth was \"a fraud and delusion for any person who wishes to treat it seriously.\" Hyslop also accused Casper Yost and the publisher of his book Henry Holt of knowing about the fraud but covering it up to increase sales of the book. In the \"Mirror\" articles appeared by Emily Hutchings and Yost defending Curran against allegations of fraud. In response, Hyslop wrote a letter to the \"Mirror\" which claimed he had been told of Curran's knowledge of Chaucer by a \"scientific man\" who had heard it from Mr Curran himself. In 1938 the ASPR journal published an anonymous article which refuted all of Hyslop's accusations. According to the article the Ozark dialect did not resemble the language of Patience Worth and knowledge of Chaucer would not have given Curran the vocabulary to compose the Patience Worth literature.\n\nDaniel Shea, a professor emeritus of English at Washington University, studied the case and wrote there might have been fraud involved by Curran's reading books and other material in the hours before the Patience Worth sessions. If true, Pearl may have felt guilt, which might have been expiated by her writing \"Rosa Alvaro, Entrante.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Their music seeks to inspire young people to keep their Islamic faith amidst the pressures and temptations of daily life. Group members identify themselves as Muslim, and wear traditional Islamic dress such as kufis and shalwar kameez. They say there is more than one way to identify as a Muslim, both by etiquette and dress. Their music typifies the subgenre \"positive hip-hop\".\n\nAt the third annual Islamic Relief \"Evening of Inspiration\", in Costa Mesa, California, Muhammad narrated a powerful slideshow, projecting images of needy, hungry children from around the world to illustrate why Islam demands that Muslims give to the less fortunate. He said that Islamic Relief \"helps the most vulnerable people from all walks of life. People don't understand how much a dollar can do. That's why this event is more than just a concert – it's a call to action.\"\n\nNative Deen performs at Islamic conferences, fundraisers, and holiday gatherings (often during Ramadan and Eid-ul-Adha).

Merbromin is an organomercuric disodium salt compound and a fluorescein. Readily available in most countries, it is no longer sold in Switzerland, Brazil, France, Germany, and the United States due to its mercury content.\n\nMerbromin's best-known use is as a topical antiseptic to treat minor wounds, burns, and scratches. It is also used in the antisepsis of the umbilical cord and the antisepsis of wounds with inhibited scar formation, such as neuropathic ulcers and diabetic foot sores. When applied on a wound, it stains the skin a distinctive carmine red, which can persist up to two weeks through repeated washings. It is useful on infections of the finger or toe nails because of its permanence and lethality to bacteria.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1998 classified merbromin as not generally recognized as safe due to a lack of recent studies and updated supporting information, not due to evidence of toxicity.\n\nIn the United States, its use has been superseded by other agents (e.g., povidone iodine, benzalkonium chloride, chloroxylenol).\n\nMerbromin is also used as a biological dye to mark tissue margins and as a metal dye in industrial dye penetrant inspection to detect metal fractures.\n\nMerbromin is synthesized by combining dibromofluorescein with mercuric acetate and sodium hydroxide or alternatively, through action of the mercuric acetate upon (or combining with) sodium dibromofluorescein.  Because of its anionic character, it is chemically incompatible with acids, the majority of alkaloid salts and most local anesthetics.\n\nMerbromin is sold under the trade name Mercurochrome (where the suffix \"-chrome\" denotes \"color\"). The name is also commonly used for over-the-counter antiseptic solutions consisting of merbromin (typically at 2% concentration) dissolved in either ethyl alcohol (tincture) or water (aqueous). \n\nIts antiseptic qualities were discovered in 1918 by Hugh H. Young, a physician at Johns Hopkins Hospital. The chemical soon became popular among parents and physicians for everyday antiseptic uses, including minor schoolyard injuries. It was commonly referred to as \"monkey blood,\" referring to its deep red color.\n\nOn , citing potential for mercury poisoning, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reclassified merbromin from \"generally recognized as safe\" to \"untested,\" effectively halting its distribution within the United States. Sales were subsequently halted in Brazil (2001), Germany (2003), and France (2006). It is readily available in most other countries.\n\nWithin the United States, products such as Humco Mercuroclear (\"Aqueous solution of benzalkonium chloride and lidocaine hydrochloride\") play on the brand recognition history of Mercurochrome but substitute other ingredients with similar properties. In Canada, Jean Coutu Group markets a chlorhexidine solution under the name Mercurochrome.\n\n"}
{"id": "2095011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2095011", "title": "Belting (music)", "text": "Belting (music)\n\nBelting (or vocal belting) is a specific technique of singing by which a singer mixes, in the proper proportions, their lower and upper resonances; resulting in a sound that resembles yelling but is actually a controlled, sustained phonation. 'Belting' is sometimes described as 'high chest voice' but this is technically incorrect, and if done incorrectly can potentially be damaging for the voice. It is often described as a vocal register, although this is also technically incorrect; it is rather a descriptive for the use of a register. Singers can use belting to convey heightened existential states.\n\nTwentieth century culture has been distinctly affected by the exponent of belting. The Broadway theatre musical radically changed its course and style with this vocalization introduced by Ethel Merman's singing of \"I Got Rhythm\" in the Gershwins' \"Girl Crazy\" in 1930. In 1964, the James Bond film Goldfinger had an opening credit sequence oversung with the \"belting\" of Shirley Bassey, a signature quality of singing to the James Bond films that continued through to the following century.\n\n\"Chest register\" is the lowest register of the singing voice, produced by dominant use of the thyroarytenoid muscle. The term \"belt\" is sometimes mistakenly described as the use of chest voice in the higher part of the voice. The chest voice is a general term for the sound and muscular functions of the speaking voice, singing in the lower range, and the voice used to shout. Each of those functions requires a thicker closure of the vocal folds and the support of the muscles surrounding them. The term \"chest voice\" is therefore a misunderstanding when it describes muscular work in the chest-area of the body, or a resonance therein. Proper production of the belt voice, according to some vocal methods, involves minimizing tension in the throat and a change of typical placement of the voice sound in the mouth, bringing it forward into the hard palate, although techniques vary by pedagogical style.\n\nIt is possible to learn classical vocal methods like \"bel canto\" and also to be able to belt; in fact, many roles now require it. Vocalists trained in a wide berth of styles describe vastly varying experiences in learning belt technique. Some claim that it comes naturally, while others struggle to access chest register other than while speaking. Style of music does not seem to be a related factor, other than in a singer's exposure to material.\n\nBelt technique requires muscle coordination not readily used in classically trained singers as the thyroarytenoid muscle is dominant (as opposed to head register singing where the \"cricothyroid muscle\" is dominant), which may be why some opera singers find learning to belt challenging.\n\nThere are many explanations as to how the belting voice quality is produced. Under a scope, the vocal folds visibly shorten and thicken, and they undulate along more of their vertical surface area than in head register when a smaller segment of their edge must undulate to produce sound.\n\nOne researcher, Jo Estill, has conducted research on the belting voice, and describes the belting voice as an extremely muscular and physical way of singing. When observing the vocal tract and torso of singers, while belting, Estill observed:\n\n\nBelting without proper coordination can lead to constriction of the muscles surrounding the vocal mechanism. Constriction can consequently lead to vocal deterioration. Correct use of the technique and, most importantly, retraction of the ventricular folds while singing is vital to safe belting, as it is, in essence a form of \"yell\" and thus involves a tremendous (roughly +70%) increase in the force exerted on the soft structures of the pharynx vs. more common modes of singing. Attempting to belt too loudly, in too high a register and without properly supporting the ventricular folds are (in combination) the \"Three Devils\" of the belter; an untrained belter may well consider the short term irritations (hoarseness, throat pain) caused by bad form to be just a \"part of the job\", when in reality it indicates a flaw in their belting skill that will cause long term serious damage (vocal cord nodules, irreversible loss of former range & timbre) if not changed.\n\nWhile acknowledging the extra risks inherent to belting, many proponents take pains to point out that it is an advanced skill which (so long as it is a \"soft yell\", and produced properly without straining and pain) is no more damaging to the voice than any other type of singing. Indeed, some genres of singing (such as blues rock) rely on belting to allow the vocalist to \"cut through\" the electric guitar while playing live. Many in the musical theater industry like to quip, \"belting is not bad; bad belting is bad.\",\n\nAs for the physiological and acoustical features of the metallic voice, a master's thesis has drawn the following conclusions:\n"}

It forms a portion of the Yellowhead Highway, a major interprovincial route of the Trans-Canada Highway system that stretches from Masset, British Columbia to Portage la Prairie, Manitoba, near Winnipeg. Highway 16 spans approximately from Alberta's border with British Columbia in the west to its border with Saskatchewan in the east. As of 2010, all but less than of the route was divided, with a minimum of two lanes in each direction. It is designated a core route in Canada's National Highway System.\n\nBritish Columbia Highway 16 becomes Alberta Highway 16 as it crosses the Continental Divide and Yellowhead Pass into Alberta, entering Jasper National Park. It travels in an easterly direction through the Municipality of Jasper until it reaches the intersection with Highway 93 (Icefields Parkway) and the west access to the Jasper townsite. East of Highway 93, the highway turns to the north, passes the east access to the Jasper townsite, and continues in a northeast direction along the Athabasca River through Improvement District No. 12. The segment of Highway 16 through Jasper National Park is maintained by the Government of Canada.\n\nUpon exiting Jasper National Park, Highway 16 is maintained by Alberta Transportation until it reaches the City of Edmonton and travels through the rural municipalities of Yellowhead County and Parkland County. The highway is a two lane, undivided highway for where it becomes a four lane, divided highway. The highway continues in a northeast direction through the Town of Hinton until it reaches the locality of Obed, where it continues in an easterly direction and crosses Obed Summit, the highest point on Yellowhead Highway. The highway passes through the Town of Edson, where the highway splits into parallel one-streets, with eastbound traffic following 2 Avenue and westbound traffic following 4 Avenue. It continues east where it passes by the Hamlets of Niton Junction, Wildwood, Evansburg and Entwistle; through the Hamlet of Gainford before passing; and north of Wabamun Lake where it passes by the Summer Village of Seba Beach, Hamlet of Fallis, Village of Wabamun, and Hamlet of Kapasiwin before intersecting Highway 43. The highway intersects Highway 16A (Parkland Highway), which prior to 1997 was part of Highway 16, and passes through the Town of Stony Plain, City of Spruce Grove, and serves as an alternate route into Edmonton. The present alignment bypasses Stony Plain and serves as the northern boundary of Spruce Grove. Highway 16 is part of the CANAMEX Corridor between Highway 43 and its western intersection with Anthony Henday Drive.\n\nHighway 16 passes through Edmonton as a major expressway called Yellowhead Trail, maintained by the City of Edmonton. Most sections of Yellowhead Trail are free-flowing, while numerous intersections between 156 Street and 50 Street are signalized.\n\nHighway 16 exits Edmonton and enters Strathcona County just west of its eastern intersection with Anthony Henday Drive (Highway 216). The highway travels east and serves as the division between Edmonton and the Urban Service Area of Sherwood Park. The highway continues east past the Hamlet of Ardrossan, through Elk Island National Park, and past the Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Village. The highway then passes through the rural municipalities of Lamont County, County of Minburn, and the County of Vermilion River. The highway continues in a general southeast direction by Town of Mundare and the Town of Vegreville, where Highway 16A passes directly through the Vegreville. The highway continues by Hamlet of Lavoy, Hamlet of Ranfurly, Village of Innisfree, Hamlet of Minburn, Village of Mannville, Town of Vermilion, Village of Kitscoty, and Hamlet of Blackfoot. The highway is maintained by Alberta Transportation, with the exception of the segment through Elk Island National Park which is maintained by the Government of Canada. Highway 16 passes through the City of Lloydminster along Ray Nelson Drive (44 Street) and is maintained by the City of Lloydminster. The highway is an arterial street and crosses into Saskatchewan at its intersection with Highway 17 (50 Avenue) where it becomes Saskatchewan Highway 16.\n\nThe Yellowhead Highway is named after the Yellowhead Pass in the Rocky Mountains. During the early 1800s, Pierre Bostonais, an Iroquois-Métis trapper with streaks of blonde in his hair, worked for the Hudson's Bay Company. Because of his hair colour, French-speaking voyageurs referred to him as \"Tête Jaune\", literally \"Yellow Head\". By 1819, Bostonais acted as a guide for the company and had explored a route down the Fraser River to the present city of Prince George. Half a century later, the Grand Trunk Pacific (GTP) and Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) constructed lines that the Yellowhead Highway later paralleled. The two lines between Evansburg, Alberta, and Red Pass Junction were combined into a joint route in 1917, with portions of both lines abandoned. The GTP and CNoR both became part of the new Canadian National Railway (CNR) by 1924.\n\nFollowing World War I, as automobile use increased exponentially, CNR surveyor Fred Driscoll and Edmonton Automobile and Good Roads Association president formed a committee lobbying for the creation of the Yellowhead Highway. Driscoll believed the abandoned railway bed would be an ideal base for a road. The Edmonton Automobile Association offered a gold medal to the first person to travel from Edmonton to Victoria through the gap. Charles Neiymer and Frank Silverthorne left in 4×4 on June 17, 1922. The following week, George Gordon and J. Sims departed Edmonton in a Ford Model T, following the same route. On July 4, both pairs arrived in Victoria and were each awarded gold medals.\n\nHowever, it would take until World War II for any improvements to be made this overland route. The displacement of many Japanese-Canadians from the Pacific coast to internment camps in the interior led to some developments. of road was constructed along the railway bed, and an additional through steep terrain. By 1944, the Tote Road was opened through Jasper and into the Fraser Valley.\n\nIn August 1948, a motorcade was organized as a demonstration of the need for the highway. The Trans-Canada Highway Act was enacted in 1949, providing a 90% subsidy to upgrade selected routes to modern standards. However, the Tote Highway was not included under this subsidy. During the same time frame, the Trans Mountain Oil Pipe Line Company began looking at the Tote Road as a potential route for a pipeline between Edmonton and Vancouver. Construction began in 1952, and largely resulted in the destruction of the road along the pipeline's path.\n\nGradually, work progressed to reconstruct the highway. Elsewhere, the main route of the Trans-Canada Highway was completed in 1957. The Yellowhead Highway became eligible for federal funding soon thereafter. By 1969, the Tote Road was generally rebuilt and paved. On August 15, 1970, British Columbia Premier W. A. C. Bennett officially opened the Yellowhead Highway.\n\nAlberta Transportation has conducted long term studies to twin Highway 16 between Jasper National Park and Highway 40 and freeway upgrades both west and east of Edmonton. Highway bypass alignments have also been planned for Hinton, Edson, and Lloydminster, all of which have been designated as Highway 16X.\n\nThe City of Edmonton has plans to convert Yellowhead Trail to a full freeway by adding two interchanges at 127 Street and 121 Street and closing four existing intersections between 149 Street and 66 Street. The City also plans to widen the road from four-lane-divided to six-lane-divided. Construction is currently underway and is expected to be completed by 2026.\n\nThe following is a list of major intersections along Alberta Highway 16 from west to east, including exit numbers where applied.\n\n!colspan=3|Yellowhead Highway\n"}

Instead, one competitor will take the lead in raising or lowering prices. The others will then follow suit, raising or lowering their prices by the same amount, with the understanding that greater profits result.\n\nThis practice can be harmful to consumers who, if the market power of the firm is used, can be forced to pay monopoly prices for goods that should be selling for only a little more than the cost of production. Nevertheless, it is very hard to prosecute because it may occur without any collusion between the competitors. Courts have held that no violation of the antitrust laws occurs where firms independently raise or lower prices, but that a violation can be shown when \"plus factors\" occur, such as firms being motivated to collude and taking actions against their own economic interests.\n\nThe term has also been used to describe industry-wide assumption of terms other than price. For example, all competitors in an industry might make only long-term leases of products such as heavy machinery, leaving lessors with no opportunity to make a short-term lease of that product from any competitor.\n\n"}

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1946 to 1949 as an independent representative, and in the House of Commons of Canada from 1951 to 1968 as a Progressive Conservative. He was a federal cabinet minister in the government of John Diefenbaker.\n\nThe son of J. W. Churchill and Mary Shier, Churchill was educated in Port Arthur, Ontario, at United College in Winnipeg and at the University of Manitoba, receiving a Master of Arts degree and a law degree. He worked as a teacher and school principal, and served as president of the Manitoba Teachers' Society. He also was a member of the law firm of Haig and Haig in Winnipeg, dominated by the family of Conservative politician John Thomas Haig.\n\nIn 1922, he married Mona Mary McLachlin.\n\nChurchill saw action in both World Wars. He served overseas in World War I from 1916 to 1919 as a Vickers Machine Gunner. During World War II, he served from 1939 to 1945 with the Fort Garry Horse and Commanding Officer (Lieutenant Colonel) 1st Canadian Carrier Regiment in Northwestern Europe. In 1945, he became Dean of Faculty at Khaki University in England.\n\nChurchill's political career began in January 1946, when he was elected to the Manitoba legislature in a special by-election for Manitobans in the Canadian Army, who had not been able to cast ballots in the 1945 provincial election. Despite his ties to the Progressive Conservative Party, he served in the legislature as an independent member for the next four years. He resigned from the Manitoba legislature in 1949 to run for the Canadian House of Commons. Running in Winnipeg South Centre, he finished a distant second against Liberal candidate Ralph Maybank. Maybank resigned two years later, and Churchill was narrowly elected over Liberal Norman Wright to replace him. He was returned by a greater margin in the 1953 federal election, and by a significant majority in the 1957 election.\n\nChurchill was a key adviser to Progressive Conservative Party leader John Diefenbaker during this period, and was widely credited with developing the strategy that propelled Diefenbaker to victory in 1957. The Liberal Party of Louis St. Laurent had been in power since 1935, and appeared to have strong popular support. Prior to the 1957 election, Churchill wrote a confidential paper arguing that the Progressive Conservative Party could form government by targeting seats in the English-speaking provinces, and did not need to invest resources in Quebec. Diefenbaker followed this strategy, and won a minority government in 1957.\n\nChurchill was appointed to Diefenbaker's cabinet on June 21, 1957 as Minister of Trade and Commerce. Later in the year, he led a 57-member trade delegation to the United Kingdom, touring firms throughout the country.\n\nThe Progressive Conservatives were re-elected with a landslide majority in the 1958 federal election, and Churchill defeated his nearest opponent in Winnipeg South Centre by a margin of almost 20,000 votes. Churchill gave approval in 1959 for Canada's first commercial power nuclear reactor, a CANDU design, to be built at Douglas Point, Ontario. In addition to holding the Trade and Commerce portfolio, he served as acting Leader of the Government in the House of Commons from January 14 to September 10, 1960. On October 17, 1960, he was confirmed to this position on a full-time basis. After a cabinet shuffle on October 11, 1960, he was named Minister of Veterans Affairs.\n\nThe Progressive Conservatives were re-elected in the 1962 federal election, but were again reduced to a minority government. Churchill's majority against Liberal Ed Russenholt fell to only 2,000 votes. After another cabinet shuffle on February 12, 1963, he was promoted to Minister of National Defence. He had not served two months in this position when the Progressive Conservatives were defeated in the 1963 federal election. Churchill defeated Liberal clergyman Fred Douglas in a further reduced majority, and served as opposition House Leader in the parliament which followed.\n\nChurchill again defeated Douglas by about 2,000 votes in the 1965 federal election, which the Progressive Conservatives also lost.\n\nDuring the flag debates of the 1960s, Churchill referred to the Pearson pennant as a \"piece of bunting\". The \"Ottawa Citizen\" quoted him describing Prime Minister Lester Pearson as \"a sawdust Caesar, reminding me of Mussolini, trying to force the country to accept his personal choice for a flag.\"\n\nChurchill remained loyal to John Diefenbaker during the Progressive Conservative Party's internal quarrels of the 1960s, and continued to work for Diefenbaker at the party's 1967 leadership convention. When Diefenbaker left the race, he sent Churchill as an emissary to Dufferin Roblin's camp to accept a Roblin badge. In February 1968, Churchill attacked new Progressive Conservative leader Robert Stanfield for not forcing an election when the Liberal government of Lester Pearson was unexpectedly defeated in the house.\n\nHe left the Progressive Conservative caucus on February 27, 1968 to sit as an Independent Progressive Conservative, and did not run for re-election in the 1968 campaign.\n\nHe died in Victoria, British Columbia at the age of 86.\n\n"}

The most notable product was the \"hickory striped\" overalls for railroad workers and agriculture workers. The name was used for the products after general manager William Pollack heard the \"Oshkosh B'Gosh\" tagline in a vaudeville routine in New York; the company adopted the name in 1937.\n\nit has become best known for its children's clothing, especially bibbed overalls. The original children's overalls, dating from the early 20th century, were intended to let parents dress their children like their fathers. According to the company, sales of the product increased after Miles Kimball, an Oshkosh-based mail order catalog, featured a pair of the overalls in its national catalog in 1960. As a result, OshKosh began to sell their products through department stores and expanded their children's line. \n\nChildren's clothing made up 15 percent of the company's sales in 1979; by 1993 that number was 95 percent.\n\nIn 1997, after 102 years in the hometown, the Wisconsin plant was closed. Oshkosh B'Gosh clothes are no longer made in Oshkosh. Downsizing of domestic operations and massive outsourcing and manufacturing at Mexican and Honduran subsidiaries saw the domestic manufacturing share drop below 10% by the year 2000. \n\nThe company was sold to Carter's, another clothing manufacturer, in 2005 for $312 million,though it still operates under the original name.\n\nToday the company sells accessories, jeans, pants, shirts, sweaters, t-shirts, tank tops, and its trademark overalls. The company produces clothing for babies, infants, toddlers, kids (4-7), and youth (5-14); however, it no longer manufactures clothing in adult sizes due to poor sales.

Narayan, is the biography of a fictional character named Sri K. V. Jagan who is a sweet vendor of (a fictional Indian town) Malgudi. His conflict with his estranged son and how he finally leaves for renunciation, overwhelmed by the sheer pressure and monotony of his life is beautifully reflected in the story.\n\nThe novel was produced into \"Mithaivalla,\" part of the Hindi TV series, \"Malgudi Days\", and was subsequently dubbed into English.The vendor of sweets tells about the relationship between a father and a son after the death of the mother.\n\nJagan is a 55-year-old sweetmeat vendor, a successful businessman, a vehement follower of Mahatma Gandhi and an honest, hardworking and humble resident of the fictional suburb, Malgudi, India. In his youth, he was influenced deeply by Mahatma Gandhi and left his studies and his peaceful life to become an active member in India's struggle for freedom from the British Empire. The \"Bhagavad Gita\" forms the staple of his life; he tries to act on the principles described in the great epic. Naturopathy forms the pivotal of his life and he even desires to publish his natural way of living in the form of a book, but it becomes obvious that it is a futile dream as the draft has been gathering dust in the office of the local printer, Nataraj, for the last five years. Jagan wears hand spun cloth that signifies purity to him, and he has been commended for it by Gandhi himself. In his early days Jagan's wife, Ambika, dies from a brain tumour and leaves him to care for his only son, Mali.\n\nMali is gradually spoilt by Jagan and his almost 'maternal' obsession towards his son's life. Later, in his college days, Mali displays his deep dislike for education and says that he would like to be a 'writer', which Jagan at first interprets as a clerical occupation. Afterwards, Mali decides to leave to America to study Creative Writing. He gets his passport and tickets ready without even informing Jagan about his plans. But, Jagan accepts this diversion with good heart and treasures every letter received from Mali and proudly exhibits it to anyone whom he met in his daily activities. A few years later, Mali returns to Malgudi very Westernized and brings along a half-American, half-Korean girl, Grace, whom Mali claims is his 'wife'. Jagan assumes that they are married according to the social norms and standards, but also realizes that Mali's relationship with him has further eroded. However, Jagan develops an affection for Grace and feels that Mali is not giving her the attention she deserves.\n\nSoon Mali expresses his grandiose scheme of starting a machine factory with the association of some anonymous business partners from America. He asks his father to invest in this factory, but Jagan is unwilling to provide the financial infrastructure of this venture, which causes more friction between Jagan and Mali. Troubled by this turmoil, Jagan decides to retire from active working. Through an unexpected meeting with the top businessmen of the region, Jagan comes across the 'bearded man', a rather eccentric hairdyer whose eloquence makes Jagan contemplate on his dull and monotonous life. He starts to develop a desire to renunciate from his life, and suddenly falls into a recollection of his happy past with his family and his wife, which further strengthens his need for reconciliation. As this happens, Mali is caught by the police for driving under the influence of alcohol and deserts his wife. Jagan then asks his cousin to make sure that Mali stays in prison for some time, so that he can learn his mistakes. Jagan also writes a cheque to the cousin so that he can buy a plane ticket to Grace so she can go back to her motherland.\n\n\nThe novel is predominantly about the relationship between father and son. Jagan - whose wife died when their son was a young boy - constantly tries to bond with his son, but fails badly due to his own backwardness in communication.\n\nAnother major theme expressed in this book is the clash of the Indian and western cultures. Jagan's lives in Malgudi and follows the Indian culture and traditions. On the other hand, Mali comes to India completely influenced by the western culture.\n\n'Chapter-1 At the beginning of the chapter one, we learn that Jagan is a very religious person who offers prayers to Lakshmi every morning.He lives by the adage '\"Conquer taste,and you will have conquered the self.\"' When Jagan's cousin questions his faith in the maxim,Jagan merely states that he is only following the advice of sages.\n\nJagan is the vendor of sweets. He owns a sweet mart where sweetmeats are prepared and sold to the customers. The writer employs both visual and olfactory imagery to depict the scene of Jagan's religious activities performed in the morning with the scent of jasmine flowers and the incense sticks.Even the scent of the sweetmeats frying in ghee spreads all around.\n\nThe novel is composed in simple, lucid English that can be read and understood without turning over the pages after a single read. The compositional language is no doubt, plain– to such an extent that even a young school child's vocabulary will be able to comprehend the sense of the tale.\n\nNarayan's skill of writing that allows him to use English to breathe life into his stories with ease can be easily found in this novel. Although Narayan's native language was Tamil ( a language from the state of Tamil Nadu in South India), he utilized English in such a way that allowed his readers to step into the streets of Malgudi, and allowed them to feel the same aromas, the same, bright Indian sunlight and the same feelings of his characters.\"\"Reading Narayan, you soon see, is a little like sitting on a rocking chair in a steadily churning train; the story is always pushing forward, with not a wasted sentence or detail, and yet its theme and often its characters are all about going nowhere and getting somewhere\n"}

He subsequently taught Roman and Estonian law at the University of Tartu until 1944. Uluots was also an editor of the Kaja newspaper from 1919–1920, and editor-in-chief of Postimees from 1937–38.\n\nUluots was elected to the Riigikogu, the Estonian parliament, for 1920–1926, and from 1929 through 1932. He was speaker of the Riigivolikogu (lower chamber) from 4 April 1938 to 12 October 1939. Uluots then served as prime minister from 1939 until June 1940 when Soviet troops entered Estonia and installed a new Soviet puppet government led by Johannes Vares, whereas Uluots' constitutional government went underground (and later, in exile). The communist puppet government was never recognized by the United States, United Kingdom and other western powers who considered it and the August 1940 annexation of Estonia into the USSR illegal. \n\nAfter the Estonian President Konstantin Päts was arrested by Soviet occupation forces and deported to Russia in July 1940, Professor Uluots became \"prime minister in the duties of the president\" as dictated by the Estonian constitution. When the Nazis invaded Soviet-occupied Estonia in 1941 the communist government was overthrown. Ulouts refused German offers to head the Estonian Self-Administration in 1941 and instead formed part of the underground Estonian resistance to the Nazi occupation regime. \n\nIn January 1944, the front was pushed back by the Soviet Army almost all the way to the former Estonian border. Narva was evacuated. Jüri Uluots delivered a radio address that implored all able-bodied men born from 1904 through 1923 to report for German military service (Before this, Uluots had opposed Estonian mobilization.) The call drew support from all across the country: 38.000 draftees appeared at German registration centers. Several thousand Estonians who had joined the Finnish army came back across the Gulf of Finland to join the newly formed Territorial Defense Force, assigned to defend Estonia against the Soviet advance. It was hoped that by engaging in such a war Estonia would be able to attract Western support for the cause of Estonia's independence from the USSR and thus ultimately succeed in achieving independence. \n\nIn March 1944 the National Committee of the Republic of Estonia was formed by the underground resistance movement in German-occupied Estonia. By April 1944 a large number of the committee members were arrested by the German security agencies. The Committee aimed to establish of a provisional government during expected German withdrawal as the Red Army had reached the border of Estonia on 2 February 1944. On 20 April 1944, the National Committee selected the Electoral Committee of the Republic of Estonia. The Committee determined that the Soviet-era appointment of Johannes Vares as Prime Minister by Konstantin Päts had been illegal and that Uluots had assumed the President's duties from 21 June 1940 onwards. On 21 June 1944, Jüri Uluots appointed Otto Tief as deputy prime minister.\n\nAs the Germans retreated in September 1944, Uluots appointed a new government, headed by Otto Tief. On 20 September, the Estonian national government was proclaimed. Estonian forces seized the government buildings in Toompea and ordered the German forces to leave.\n\nTief's government left Tallinn prior to the Soviet army's arrival and went into hiding. But most of the cabinet members were later arrested and suffered various repressions by the Soviet authorities, or were sent to labour camps in Siberia. The remainder of the government fled to Stockholm, Sweden, where it operated in exile from 1944 to 1992 when Heinrich Mark, who was prime minister in duties of the president, presented his credentials to incoming president Lennart Meri.\n\nUluots died of gastric cancer shortly after arriving in Sweden in 1945.\n\n1938 – Order of the White Star I\n\n"}

Clark was an unarmed getaway driver in the Brink's robbery of 1981 in Nanuet, New York. The robbers murdered a security guard and two Nyack, New York police officers. Clark was arrested in October 1981 and convicted of felony murder for her role in the crime. She was sentenced to the maximum penalty allowed by law: Imprisonment for a term of 75 years to life at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in New York. \n\nIn December 2016, after extensive public and legal support, Governor Andrew Cuomo commuted her sentence to 35 years to life, making her eligible for parole. She was denied parole in April 2017, but granted parole on April 17, 2019 after 37 years in prison. Clark was released on May 10, 2019.\n\nClark grew up in a Jewish family with her older brother and parents, Joe Clark and his wife Ruth. Her parents were members of the American Communist Party for many years. As an infant, Clark lived in the Soviet Union from 1950 to 1953. After the family returned home to the U.S., her parents withdrew from the Communist Party, disillusioned with the Soviet Union.\n\nClark attended the University of Chicago, where she joined Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and helped to found the Women's Radical Action Project, one of the first organizations of the early women's liberation movement.\n\nIn 1969, Clark participated in the Days of Rage in Chicago, and she was arrested, along with several hundreds of others, for \"mob action\". Clark jumped bail and was considered a \"fugitive from justice\". When she was caught, she pleaded guilty and served nine months in Cook County Jail in Chicago.\n\nTwo months after her release, there was a prison uprising at Attica. In its wake, Clark was one of the founders of \"The Midnight Special,\" a newspaper affiliated with the National Lawyers Guild. Clark was also a member of the Women's Bail Fund and worked in support of political prisoners. \n\nWhen the May 19th Communist Organization was founded in 1976, Clark became a member, continuing her work as someone who visited political prisoners. She was a named petitioner in the lawsuit \"Clark v. U.S.A.,\" which challenged the FBI's Cointelpro Program. That suit was eventually settled in the plaintiffs' favor.\n\nUltimately, May 19 became an isolated remnant of the dwindling \"anti-imperialist\" movement, and Clark became isolated from society at large.\n\nOn October 20, 1981, a Brink's armored truck was robbed of $1.6 million by six men at the Nanuet Mall in Nanuet, New York. During the robbery, Peter Paige, a Brink's guard, was killed and guard Joseph Trombino was seriously injured. As the men escaped from the robbery, the van into which they had switched was stopped by a police barricade, and two Nyack police officers, Waverly Brown and Edward O'Grady, were killed during the gun battle that ensued. Clark was the driver of a nearby getaway car into which one of the robbers and David Gilbert jumped after the gun battle. After a car chase, Clark was arrested as she reached for a loaded weapon. Also arrested at the scene was Kathy Boudin, who served 22 years in prison and has been released on parole.\n\nClark was charged with three counts of felony murder and was tried together with David Gilbert and Kuwesi Balagoon. They refused to be represented by counsel; instead, they decided to represent themselves. When the three defendants refused to behave in accordance with courtroom decorum, they were banned from the courtroom and placed in cells in the basement; the trial was piped in over a speaker system. No standby counsel was appointed to represent the defendants. All three were convicted of all charges, and each was sentenced to three consecutive 25-year-to-life sentences. Boudin, who was represented by counsel, entered a plea of guilty to a single count of felony murder and received a sentence of 20 years to life.\n\nClark was incarcerated at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in New York. \n\nIn September 1985, letters implicating Clark in a possible escape plan were found. She was charged with conspiracy to escape and sentenced to two years in solitary confinement in the Special Housing Unit (SHU). In SHU, Clark began a process of self-reflection, which ultimately led to her renouncing her status as a \"political prisoner\". Clark publicly apologized for her role in the Brink's robbery in March 2002.\n\nClark participated in a number of writing groups, including one led for twelve years by poet Hettie Jones. Clark was among the inmates at Bedford Hills featured in the 2003 documentary \"What I Want My Words to Do to You\".\n\nWhile in prison, Clark also obtained a bachelor's degree and a master's degree, developed an AIDS education program, trained service dogs, and counseled incarcerated mothers.\n\nIn 2006, a United States District Court granted Clark a writ of habeas corpus, reversing her conviction on the grounds that she was deprived of her Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The court ruled: \"During the prosecutor's opening statement and during the government's entire direct case against defendants, which spanned at least seven trial days, no one was present in the courtroom to represent Clark's interests. Clark was without assistance of counsel for her defense, in clear abrogation of her Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\"\n\nHowever, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the district court's decision on the grounds that Clark had procedurally defaulted on her claim by not raising it on direct appeal before the state court, and had knowingly and intelligently waived her Sixth Amendment rights by choosing to represent herself.\n\nRepresented by attorney Sara Bennett, Clark petitioned Governor Paterson for clemency in 2010. More than 900 people wrote letters in support of her petition, including: Robert Dennison, the former chairperson of parole under Governor Pataki; Elaine Lord, the superintendent of Bedford Hills for the first 22 years of Clark's incarceration; and Frank Olivier, a corrections officer of 23 years who grew up with one of the deceased as a role model.\n\nLord wrote to the governor, \"I watched her change into one of the most perceptive, thoughtful, helpful and profound human beings that I have ever known, either inside or outside of a prison.\" Dennison wrote that she was \"the most worthy candidate for clemency that I’ve ever seen.\"\n\nClark, represented by Michael Cardozo, again applied for clemency, and in December 2016, Governor Andrew Cuomo commuted her sentence to 35 years to life. When granting clemency, the governor said Clark had made \"exceptional strides in self-development\".\n\nAfter Governor Andrew Cuomo commuted her sentence to 35 years to life in December 2016, Clark became eligible for parole. She was denied parole in April 2017. According to the Parole Board, Clark was \"still a symbol of violent and terroristic crime\". More than 10,000 New Yorkers submitted their signatures in opposition to parole for Clark.\n\nDespite opposition from conservative lawmakers, law enforcement groups, and prosecutors Clark was granted parole in a split decision on April 17, 2019 and was released from prison on May 10, 2019. Clark's supporters had \"bombarded the State Parole Board with pleas for her release\".\n\nClark was a model for a character in David Mamet's play \"The Anarchist\". Additionally, she was the inspiration for the role of Hannah, performed by Dame Harriet Walter in the 2016 Donmar Warehouse production of Shakespeare's \"The Tempest\".\n\n\n"}

It is cognate to the Chinese family names Shēn (申) and Xin (辛). According to the 2000 census in South Korea, there were 911,556 people carrying the Shin surname.\n\nThere are three Chinese characters for the Shin surname. Between these three characters, there are six different clans. Each Shin clan descends from a different founding ancestor. One of the Shin clans, the Yeongsan Shin clan traces its origins to China. Members of the various Shin clans can be found throughout the Korean peninsula.\n\nAs with other Korean family names, the holders of the \"Shin\" family name are divided into various clans, each known by the name of a town or city, called \"bon-gwan\" in Korean. Usually that town or city is the one where the clan's founder lived. There are six lines of Shin: (1) Pyeongsan Shin (平山 申), (2) Goryeong Shin (高靈 申), (3) Aju Shin (鵝洲 申) (4) Saknyeong Shin (朔寧 申) (5) Yeongsan Shin (靈山 辛), and (6) Samgal Shin (삼갈 愼). Although the first four clans — Pyeongsan Shin, Goryeong Shin, Aju Shin, and Saknyeong Shin — share the same Chinese character 申, they are unrelated in heritage. The fifth lineage uses the Chinese character 辛, and the sixth lineage uses the Chinese character 愼.\n\nThe Pyeongsan Shin lineage makes up about 70% of all those with the name Shin using the Chinese character 申. The clan's founder was General Shin Sung-gyeom. This clan associated with a mountain in North Korea called \"Pyeongsan\" (平山, literally \"mountain of peace\"). The mountain was originally named Samneungsan (三能山, literally \"mountain of three talents\"), without a family name, before being linked to the Shin surname by King Taejo of Goryeo.\n\nAccording to the Pyeongsan Shin family legend, one day when King Taejo and his generals went out hunting near Pyeongsan, Taejo saw three geese flying above them, and asked his generals whether any of them could shoot the geese down. Shin Sung-gyeom volunteered and asked Taejo which one he should shoot. Taejo asked Shin to shoot the third goose in its left wing, and to Taejo's surprise, Shin completed the task. Taejo was highly impressed and gave Shin 300 gyeol (결 or 結, an ancient measurement of area) of local land, which became Shin Sung-gyeom's hometown.\n\nShin Sung-gyeom also saved the life of King Taejo of Goryeo during a disastrous battle with Hubaekje near present-day Daegu in the early 10th century. Taejo awarded General Shin the clan name Pyeongsan Sin, after his hometown, for his loyalty and bravery he showed in the battle. Other prominent members of this clan include the 16th-century artist, writer, and poet Shin Saimdang and the 19th-century pansori writer Shin Jae-hyo.\n\nEvery year, a number of people who claim to belong to the Pyeongsan Shin clan gather at the memorial shrine of Shin Sung-gyeom in the South Korean province of Gangwon Province. Prior to the Korean war, the original shrine was situated in the now North-Korean province of Hwanghae Province, to which the clan land of Pyeongsan traces its roots.\n\nAnother well-known line that also uses the Chinese character 申 is the Goryeong Shin, descended from Shin Suk-ju, who was the lead scholar to work with King Sejong the Great in the development of Hangul, the Korean written language. Shin Suk-ju was also a high ranking government minister and belonged to the Hall of Worthies. The Goryeong Shin lineage makes up about 17% of all those who carry the Shin name using the Chinese character 申. Three of five members of Shin Suk-ju's 16th generation are known to have immigrated to the United States in the 1970s. One descendant of the Shins to travel to the US is a famous and scholarly physician named David Sheen. Another prominent member of the clan is Danjae Shin Chaeho, a 19th-century nationalist historian.\n\n\n\n[[Category:Korean-language surnames]]\n[[Category:Sin clans| ]]"}

Administered by the Tribunals Service, it was superseded in 2005 by the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal, which itself was superseded in 2010 by the Asylum and Immigration Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal created by the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.\n\nThe system of appeals to adjudicators appointed by the Home Secretary, with the right of appeal to a body then called the Immigration Appeal Tribunal, with members appointed by the Lord Chancellor, was created by the Immigration Appeals Act 1969. As a result of the Immigration Act 1971, the Immigration Appellate Authority (IAA) became an independent judicial body consisting of two tiers: Immigration Adjudicators and an Immigration Appeal Tribunal (IAT). The Adjudicators initially considered appeals against decisions made by Immigration Officers, entry clearance officers and the Home Secretary, based in permanent centres in Islington, London, Hatton Cross, Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester and Glasgow. The Tribunal dealt with applications for leave to appeal and appeals against decisions made by the Immigration Adjudicators, with its main hearing centre in Bream's Buildings, off Chancery Lane in Central London.\n\nThe Tribunal was headed by a President, who was required to be a barrister or a solicitor of at least seven years' standing. From 1999, a High Court judge was appointed President rather than a member of the IAA. Both lay members and legally-qualified members were appointed to the IAT.\n\n\nThe two tier structure of the Immigration Appellate Authority was abolished by the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004, which created the single tier Asylum and Immigration Tribunal to replace it. All former adjudicators and members of the IAA became members of the new AIT. The Home Office Adjudicators became known as Immigration Judges, although many of them were not formally qualified as judges. The former 'regional adjudicators' became known as Senior Immigration Judges, mostly involved in reconsidering applications for previously dismissed appeals.\n\n"}

Built in 1988 in Lahaina on the island of Maui, the \"Hawaiian Chieftain\" is a contemporary interpretation of a traditional design. She is unique with the rig of a 19th-century trading vessel and a modern triple keel, shallow draft hull. Drawing only , she is highly maneuverable in shallow waters.\n\nThe Hawaiian Chieftain was commissioned by Laurence H. Dorcy, Jr., designed by nautical architect Ray Richards, and built by Lahaina Welding Co. Ltd. on the island of Maui; Drake Thomas was the ship's builder. Lofting, initial hull framing and partial hull plating was performed by Morgan Davies (until his departure from the project in December 1986).Completion of hull welding (including bow and topside plating) was performed by ship welders Ken Bear, Bill Purvis, Lionel Clemons and Oliver Pagttie. Additional expert tradesmen were hired for the rigging (George Herbert/Ivan Hope), ship's carpentry, machinery (Alan Fleming, Carl Geringer) and electrical installation. Master Mariner Des Kearns played a key role as a Project Director from early 1987 until launch in June 1988. Under its paint, her bowsprit bears the inscription \"Lahaina Welding Co.\" Her maiden voyage was to French Polynesia on April 1, 1990 and arriving in Papeete on April 20, 1990. She was based in Sausalito, CA for many years, sailing up and down the coast with the \"Lady Washington\" on \"Voyages of ReDiscovery\", providing hands-on history programs teaching 4th and 5th graders about the exploration and trade along the West Coast in the 1790s.\nIn the winter of 2004, she was sold to a Cape Cod sailing program and renamed the \"Spirit of Larinda\"; however, due to the unexpected death of her owner, she remained inactive. In October 2005, the Grays Harbor Historical Seaport Authority, owner of \"Lady Washington\", purchased her to add to its fleet.

{"id": "2095134", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2095134", "title": "Oligodynamic effect", "text": "Oligodynamic effect\n\nThe oligodynamic effect (from Greek oligos \"few\", and dynamis \"force\") is a biocidal effect of metals, especially heavy metals, that occurs even in low concentrations. \n\nIn modern times, the effect was observed by Karl Wilhelm von Nägeli, although he did not identify the cause. Scholarly texts from ancient India promoted the use of brass and silver in ritual cleansing practice as well as in consumption of food and drink. The ancient Indian medical text Sushruta Samhita promoted the use of specific metals in surgical procedures as a measure to prevent infection. Brass doorknobs and silverware both exhibit this effect to an extent.\n\nThe metals react with thiol (-SH) or amine (-NH) groups of proteins, a mode of action to which microorganisms may develop resistance. Such resistance may be transmitted by plasmids.\n\nAluminium acetate (Burow's solution) is used as an astringent mild antiseptic.\n\nOrthoesters of diarylstibinic acids are fungicides and bactericides, used in paints, plastics, and fibers. Trivalent organic antimony was used in therapy for schistosomiasis.\n\nFor many decades, arsenic was used medicinally to treat syphilis. It is still used in sheep dips, rat poisons, wood preservatives, weed killers, and other pesticides. Arsenic is also still used for murder by poisoning, for which use it has a long and continuing history in both literature and fact.\n\nBarium polysulfide is a fungicide and acaricide used in fruit and grape growing.\n\nBismuth compounds have been used because of their astringent, antiphlogistic, bacteriostatic, and disinfecting actions. In dermatology bismuth subgallate is still used in vulnerary salves and powders as well as in antimycotics. In the past, bismuth has also been used to treat syphilis and malaria.\n\nBoric acid esters derived from glycols (example, organo-borate formulation, \"Biobor JF\") are being used for the control of microorganisms in fuel systems containing water.\n\nBrass vessels release a small amount of copper ions into stored water, thus killing fecal bacterial counts as high as 1 million bacteria per milliliter.\n\nCopper sulfate mixed with lime (Bordeaux mixture) is used as a fungicide and antihelminthic. Copper sulfate is used chiefly to destroy green algae (algicide) that grow in reservoirs, stock ponds, swimming pools, and fish tanks. Copper 8-hydroxyquinoline is sometimes included in paint to prevent mildew.\n\nPaint containing copper is used on boat bottoms to prevent barnacle growth.\n\nGold is used in dental inlays and inhibits the growth of bacteria.\n\nPhysicians prescribed various forms of lead to heal ailments ranging from constipation to infectious diseases such as the plague. Lead was also used to preserve or sweeten wine. Lead arsenate is used in insecticides and herbicides. Some organic lead compounds are used as industrial biocides: thiomethyl triphenyllead is used as an antifungal agent, cotton preservative, and lubricant additive; thiopropyl triphenyllead as a rodent repellant; tributyllead acetate as a wood and cotton preservative; tributyllead imidazole as a lubricant additive and cotton preservative.\n\nPhenylmercuric borate and acetate were used for disinfecting mucous membranes at an effective concentration of 0.07% in aqueous solutions. Due to toxicological and ecotoxicological reasons phenylmercury salts are no longer in use. However, some surgeons use mercurochrome despite toxicological objections. Dental amalgam used in fillings inhibits bacterial reproduction.\n\nOrganic mercury compounds have been used as topical disinfectants (thimerosal, nitromersol and merbromin) and preservatives in medical preparations (thimerosal) and grain products (both methyl and ethyl mercurials). Mercury was used in the treatment of syphilis. Calomel was commonly used in infant teething powders in the 1930s and 1940s. Mercurials are also used agriculturally as insecticides and fungicides.\n\nThe toxicity of nickel to bacteria, yeasts, and fungi differs considerably.\n\nThe metabolism of bacteria is adversely affected by silver ions at concentrations of 0.01–0.1 mg/L. Therefore, even less soluble silver compounds, such as silver chloride, also act as bactericides or germicides, but not the much less soluble silver sulfide. In the presence of atmospheric oxygen, metallic silver also has a bactericidal effect due to the formation of silver oxide, which is soluble enough to cause it. Even objects with a solid silver surface (e.g., table silver, silver coins, or silver foil) have a bactericidal effect. Silver drinking vessels were carried by military commanders on expeditions for protection against disease. It was once common to place silver foil or even silver coins on wounds for the same reason.\n\nSilver sulfadiazine is used as an antiseptic ointment for extensive burns. An equilibrium dispersion of colloidal silver with dissolved silver ions can be used to purify drinking water at sea. Silver is incorporated into medical implants and devices such as catheters. Surfacine (silver iodide) is a relatively new antimicrobial for application to surfaces. Silver-impregnated wound dressings have proven especially useful against antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Silver nitrate is used as a hemostatic, antiseptic and astringent. At one time, many states required that the eyes of newborns be treated with a few drops of silver nitrate to guard against an infection of the eyes called gonorrheal neonatal ophthalmia, which the infants might have contracted as they passed through the birth canal. Silver ions are increasingly incorporated into many hard surfaces, such as plastics and steel, as a way to control microbial growth on items such as toilet seats, stethoscopes, and even refrigerator doors. Among the newer products being sold are plastic food containers infused with silver nanoparticles, which are intended to keep food fresher, and silver-infused athletic shirts and socks, which claim to minimize odors.\n\nThallium compounds such as thallium sulfate have been used for impregnating wood and leather to kill fungal spores and bacteria, and for the protection of textiles from attack by moths. Thallium sulfate has been used as a depilatory and in the treatment of venereal disease, skin fungal infections, and tuberculosis.\n\nTetrabutyltin is used as an antifouling paint for ships, for the prevention of slimes in industrial recirculating water systems, for combating freshwater snails that cause bilharzia, as a wood and textile preservative, and as a disinfectant. Tricyclohexyltin hydroxide is used as an acaricide. Triphenyltin hydroxide and triphenyltin acetate are used as fungicides.\n\nZinc oxide is used as a weak antiseptic (and sunscreen), and in paints as a white pigment and mold-growth inhibitor. Zinc chloride is a common ingredient in mouthwashes and deodorants, and zinc pyrithione is an ingredient in antidandruff shampoos. Galvanized (zinc-coated) fittings on roofs impede the growth of algae. Copper- and zinc-treated shingles are available. Zinc iodide and zinc sulfate are used as topical antiseptics.\n\nBesides the individual toxic effects of each metal, a wide range of metals are nephrotoxic in humans and/or in animals. Some metals and their compounds are carcinogenic to humans. A few metals, such as lead and mercury, can cross the placental barrier and impact fetal development. Several (cadmium, zinc, copper, and mercury) can induce special protein complexes called metallothioneins.\n\n"}

California, 283 U.S. 359 (1931), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled 7–2 that a 1919 California statute banning red flags was unconstitutional because it violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. This decision is considered a landmark in the history of First Amendment constitutional law, as it was one of the first cases where the Court extended the Fourteenth Amendment to include a protection of the substance of the First Amendment, in this case symbolic speech or \"expressive conduct\", from state infringement.\n\nThe Better America Federation (BAF), a group whose goal was to clear the State of California from what they deemed to be dangerous dissent, targeted the Pioneer Summer Camp (PSC) in summer 1929. The youth camp for working-class children was maintained by a number of different groups and organizations, some of which were either openly Communist or had expressed sympathy for the Communist Party's goals. California had a state law, enacted in 1919, that prohibited public display of a red flag. The BAF persuaded a local sheriff to search the Pioneer Summer Camp. The resultant search turned up a red flag; the sheriff then arrested Yetta Stromberg, a summer teacher at the camp, along with several other employees.\n\nStromberg was a nineteen-year-old student at the University of Southern California, and a member of the Young Communist League, an international organization affiliated with the Communist Party. In the state trials, the charge brought up against her was in relation to a daily ceremony that took place at the summer camp on a loaned ranch near Yucaipa, California, where she worked as a teacher. During the ceremony, Stromberg supervised and directed the youth in raising a red flag, and in pledging allegiance to \"the workers' red flag, and to the cause for which it stands, one aim throughout our lives, freedom for the working class.\" Stromberg was also found to have owned a number of books and other printed materials advocating violence and armed uprisings, though she testified that none of such materials were employed in her teaching of the children.\n\nStromberg was tried and convicted in state court. She appealed the conviction to the Supreme Court on the grounds that the California statute in question outlawed the symbol of a legally recognized party. Stromberg's attorneys cited Holmes' concept of the \"clear and present danger\" test, asserting that the circumstances of the act must be considered as part of the decision.\n\nThe Court had to consider whether the 1919 California Red Flag Law was unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment. In a 7–2 decision, Chief Justice Hughes followed the logic of the Holmes doctrine introduced in \"Schenck v. United States\", 249 U.S. 47 (1919), and concluded on 18 May 1931 that the broad red flag ban was too vague, and could be used to disrupt the constitutionally-protected opposition by citizenry to those in power. The California legislature repealed the law in 1933.\n\nIn an opinion delivered by Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, the Court considered whether any of the three clauses of the California law, were, as the applicant alleged, a violation of her constitutionally-protected rights. The Court had previously established in a series of cases that the right of free speech is essential to liberty, and is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The opinion noted, however, that this protection did not extend to forms of expression which may incite violence, crime, or the overthrow of organized government by unlawful means. The Court found little reason to question the validity of the second and third clauses of the statute as they pertain to such prohibited forms of expression and concentrated instead on the first clause.\n\nThe first clause prohibited individuals to display \"a red flag, banner or badge or any flag, badge, banner, or device of any color or form whatever in any public place or in any meeting place or public assembly,\" even when such a red flag did not represent a symbol of opposition to organized government (clause 2) or as a stimulus to anarchistic action (clause 3).\n\nUpon examining the vagueness of the statute, the Court concluded that a law so indefinite as to permit the punishment of peaceful and orderly opposition exercised in accordance with legal means and constitutional imitations was \"repugnant to the guarantee of liberty contained in the Fourteenth Amendment.\" In thus finding the first clause of the statute invalid, the Court set aside the conviction of the appellant, as the conviction appeared to have rested exclusively on that first clause. The Court did not proceed to rule on the constitutionality of the second and third clauses of the statute.\n\nAssociate Justice James C. McReynolds dissented from the Court's opinion.\n\nJustice McReynolds argued in his dissent that the Court has, at many times in the past, applied the rule that it may not review any question arising from a state court ruling unless it is shown that the question was determined in the state court or at least duly presented for such a determination. In this specific instance, no such challenges appeared to have been brought.\n\nFurther, when the case was considered by the Court of Appeals, it held that since the petitioner was charged with violation of all the clauses of the statutes and thus convicted, the conviction could not be reversed even if one of the clauses was found to be invalid. McReynolds agreed with this determination and suggested that the judgment should be affirmed.\n\nJustice Butler wrote a detailed dissent in this matter, addressing several different issues.\n\nThe Court, in the majority opinion, held the first clause of the California statute to be invalid, and as it found that the conviction may have depended exclusively upon that clause, it reversed the state court. Justice Butler, however, believed that the record affirmatively showed that the petitioner was not convicted for violation of the first clause. Prior to the trial of this case, the California Supreme Court had already deemed invalid a city ordinance that would make unlawful the public display of a red flag, emblem, etc. Thus, under that decision, the California state courts were already directed to hold invalid the first clause of the statute, as it construed peaceable opposition to organized government.\n\nFurther, the effect of the instructions given to the jury was to inform them that the defendant had the unlimited right to advocate changes in the government, so long as such advocacy was peaceful; the jury was further informed that any organization peaceably advocating changes in the government could adopt any flag and it was not possible to make that unlawful.\n\nThe record does not show that the defendant separately challenged in the trial court the validity of the first clause. Defendanse counsel likewise failed to object to state's instructions, and told the Court of Appeals that he was satisfied that the instructions were correct. The Court of Appeals found the second and third provisions of section 403a of the California Penal Code to be in compliance with the state and federal Constitutions' guarantees of freedom of speech. But it stated that the constitutionality of the first clause was \"questionable,\" taking particular issue with the phrase \"of opposition to organized government.\" The Court of Appeals suggested that this phrase could be eliminated from the section without introducing material changes to its purpose.\n\nJustice Butler argued that due consideration makes it clear that the defendant did not claim that the jury could have found her guilty of violating the first clause of the statute; that the Court of Appeals did not rule on the question of whether such a first-clause conviction would be constitutional; and lastly, that the validity of the first clause was mentioned in the concurring opinion only upon the question of whether the second and third clauses must be found invalid if the first clause was to be found unconstitutional.\n\nJustice Butler believed that in this case, the Court was not called upon to decide whether the display of the flag constituted constitutionally-protected speech, nor to decide whether such speech was protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, nor whether the real or imagined anarchy that could follow a successful opposition to organized government creates a sufficiently compelling reason to prohibit such activities. It appears (though he does not specify it in his dissent) that he viewed the matter as that of procedural challenges, rather than a case of broad protections of freedom of speech.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2095158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2095158", "title": "Downtown Las Vegas", "text": "Downtown Las Vegas\n\nDowntown Las Vegas (commonly abbreviated as DTLV) is the central business district and historic center of Las Vegas, Nevada. It is the original townsite and was the gambling district of Las Vegas prior to the Strip, and the area still incorporates downtown gaming. As the urban core of the Las Vegas Valley, it features a variety of hotel and business highrises, cultural centers, historical buildings and government institutions, as well as residential and retail developments. Downtown is located in the center of the Las Vegas Valley and just north of the Las Vegas Strip, centered on Fremont Street, the Fremont Street Experience and Fremont East. The city defines the area as bounded by I-15 on the west, Washington Avenue on the north, Maryland Parkway on the east and Sahara Avenue on the south.\n\nPerhaps the earliest visitors to the Las Vegas area were nomadic Paleo-Indians, who traveled to the area 10,000 years ago, leaving behind petroglyphs. Anasazi and Paiute tribes came here at least 2,000 years ago.\n\nThe area was named Las Vegas, which is Spanish for \"the meadows\", in the 1800s because it featured abundant wild grasses, as well as desert spring waters for westward travelers.\n\nThe year 1844 marked the arrival of John C. Frémont, whose writings helped lure pioneers to the area. Downtown Las Vegas’ Fremont Street is named after him.\n\nEleven years later, members of the LDS Church chose Las Vegas as the site to build a fort halfway between Salt Lake City and Los Angeles, where they would travel to gather supplies. The fort was abandoned several years afterward. The remainder of this fort can still be seen at the intersection of Las Vegas Boulevard and Washington Avenue at the Old Las Vegas Mormon Fort State Historic Park.\n\nLas Vegas was founded as a city in 1905, when 110 acres of land adjacent to the Union Pacific Railroad tracks were auctioned in what would become the downtown area. In 1911, Las Vegas was incorporated as a city.\n\nThe year 1931 was a pivotal one for Las Vegas. At that time, Nevada legalized casino gambling and reduced residency requirements for divorce to six weeks. This year also witnessed the beginning of construction on nearby Hoover Dam. The influx of construction workers and their families helped Las Vegas avoid economic calamity during the Great Depression. It was completed in 1935.\n\nFollowing World War II, lavishly decorated hotels, gambling casinos and big-name entertainment became synonymous with Las Vegas.\n\nThe 1950s saw the opening of the Moulin Rouge Hotel, the first racially integrated casino-hotel in Las Vegas.\n\nIn 1951, the first atomic bomb detonation at the Nevada Test Site, 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas, occurred. City residents and visitors were able to witness the mushroom clouds until 1963, when the Limited Test Ban Treaty required that nuclear tests be moved underground.\n\nDuring the 1960s, corporations and business powerhouses such as Howard Hughes were building and buying hotel-casino properties. Gambling was referred to as \"gaming,\" which transitioned into legitimate business.\n\nIn 1989, entrepreneur Steve Wynn changed the face of the Las Vegas gaming industry by opening up The Mirage, the Las Vegas Strip’s first mega-casino resort. This strengthened the pull of visitors away from the downtown area.\n\nIn 1995, the Fremont Street Experience in Las Vegas’ downtown area was opened. This canopied, five-block area features 12.5 million LED lights and 550,000 watts of sound from dusk until midnight during shows held on the top of each hour.\n\nDue to years of revitalization efforts, 2012 was dubbed “The Year of Downtown.” Hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of projects made their debut at this time. They included The Smith Center for the Performing Arts and Discovery Children’s Museum, the Mob Museum, the Neon Museum, a new City Hall complex.\n\nIn 2018, plans for a new downtown expo center were announced, replacing and expanding on space previously provided by the Cashman Center.\n\nFremont Street is home to most of downtown's hotels and casinos. These are the original casinos of Las Vegas, which existed before the more famous Las Vegas Strip. The Fremont Street Experience is a canopied street of the downtown area where casinos have been connected to the street and to each other in a unique visual manner. With more than 2 million lights and a state-of-the-art sound system, the Fremont Street Experience brings nightly shows through the world's largest audio-video system. The $70 million attraction features the ultimate in multisensory entertainment. It also provides a variety of exciting special events, cuisine, entertainment and live concerts throughout the year.\n\nProperty and business owners have been working to redevelop Fremont Street just east of the Fremont Street Experience. In 2002, the city of Las Vegas Redevelopment Agency joined with Fremont East property and business owners to create a business improvement district, as well as pay for a $5.5 million streetscape improvement. This area is called the Fremont East Entertainment District. It features an eclectic mix of bars, clubs and restaurants. Centered on Las Vegas Boulevard on Fremont Street, this three-block renovation includes pedestrian-friendly street redesign, landscaping and retro-looking neon signage.\n\nOfficially called 18b, The Las Vegas Arts District – named after the 18 blocks the district originally encompassed – this area is home to the city's arts scene with its mix of art galleries, studios and stores. Many arts district stores offer antiques, vintage clothing, high fashion, and mid-20th century furniture/furnishings and other collectible items. Centered on Main Street and Charleston Boulevard, the area hosts the popular First Friday festival every month featuring art, music and other performances.\n\nSymphony Park is a mixed-use urban district being built on the land to the west of Fremont and Main streets. It will eventually feature a mix of retail, medical, hotel and residential developments. The city of Las Vegas is undertaking the development on of land purchased from the Union Pacific Railroad in 1995. This is a major project for the Las Vegas Redevelopment Agency and the city. Projects that have been completed and are currently operating at Symphony Park are the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, The Smith Center for the Performing Arts and the Discovery Children's Museum.\n\nBusiness and government leaders have begun working on a plan to expand downtown’s Las Vegas Medical District (LVMD) from its current 200 acres to at least 680 acres. While currently offering the largest concentration of health-care services in the Las Vegas valley, an expanded district would allow for additional health-care services and opportunities. Areas for planned expansion include the Charleston Boulevard corridor to Valley View Boulevard, along Martin L. King Boulevard and in Symphony Park. The centerpiece of this expanded district will be the 260,000-square-foot UNLV School of Medicine, which will include an educational building and library. The school was granted preliminary accreditation in late 2016 and can begin accepting students for its 2017 charter class.\n\nCentered on Bonneville Avenue and Casino Center Boulevard, most of this area is filled with office and government buildings. With several court buildings located here, there are many judicial-related businesses such as law firms in the immediate area. The financial district is home to the Las Vegas City Hall building, the Lloyd D. George U.S. Courthouse and several bank buildings such as Bank of America. The Clark County Marriage Bureau is also located here at the Regional Justice Center.\n\nDowntown is a hub for arts and culture in the metro area. The main venue for performing arts is the Art Deco-inspired Smith Center for the Performing Arts. In addition to The Smith Center and 18b, The Las Vegas Arts District, there are a number of educational facilities in the Cultural Corridor, located just north of the immediate downtown area. They include the Las Vegas Natural History Museum, the Neon Museum and Boneyard and the Old Las Vegas Mormon Fort State Historic Park. Also in this area are a number of neon signs from former Las Vegas casinos and landmarks, which have been restored and installed on several streets around downtown, as well as throughout the Fremont Street Experience. A famous neon icon of downtown Las Vegas is the Vegas Vic sign, also located at the Fremont Street Experience.\n\n\nSeveral buildings of architectural significance exist downtown, although being founded in 1905, Las Vegas lacks the number of historical buildings of older cities. Exceptions include the Historic Fifth Street School, built in 1936 in the Spanish-mission style and listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Also listed is the Las Vegas Post Office and Courthouse, which currently serves as home to The Mob Museum and is one of the few historical neoclassical buildings in the city. Built in 1930, the Las Vegas Academy of International Studies and Performing Arts is the city's best example of Art Deco architecture. The Morelli House, built in 1959, is a notable mid-century modern design. The building that formerly housed the Las Vegas City Hall, and now is home to the corporate headquarters for the online retailer Zappos.com, is a notable example of 1970s modern architecture.\n\nAs Las Vegas boomed, more recent buildings tended to take inspiration from a variety of styles. The Clark County Government Center has a red sandstone exterior invoking a desert motif. The Smith Center for the Performing Arts, opened in 2012, is a more modern example of Art Deco design. Architect Frank Gehry designed the building for the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health building in deconstructionist style. It was completed in 2010.\n\n\nDowntown serves as a main center for government services in the Las Vegas Valley. Government offices for the city of Las Vegas and Clark County are located here, as well as the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and several courts.\n\nSome former government buildings have been turned into attractions, such as the old Las Vegas Post Office and Courthouse becoming the Mob Museum.\n\nTwo major freeways—Interstate 15 and Interstate 515/U.S. Route 95—cross in downtown Las Vegas. RTC Transit is a public transportation system providing bus service throughout Las Vegas, including the downtown area.\n\nA bus rapid transit link in Las Vegas called the Strip & Downtown Express (previously ACE Gold Line) with limited stops and frequent service was launched in March 2010. It connects downtown Las Vegas, the Strip and the Las Vegas Convention Center. It stops at the Bonneville Transit Center. Completed in 2012, the transit terminal serves as a central transfer point for downtown and features 16 vehicle bays for buses and 100 bike racks.\n\nThe Downtown Loop is a free shuttle servicing many attractions in downtown Las Vegas. The Loop runs continuously during operating hours and arrives at each stop every 20 minutes. The hours of operation are Monday through Thursday: 11:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.; Friday through Saturday: 3 p.m. to 12 a.m.; Sunday: 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.\n\nThe AAA Free Self-Driving Shuttle is a pilot program that provides rides in the Fremont East Entertainment District Nov 2017 – Nov 2018. The pilot program is a partnership with Keolis, the city of Las Vegas, and the Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada. The shuttle runs Tuesday – Sunday 4:30pm – 8:30pm, with the main station stop at the Downtown Container Park. Shuttle service is suspended during the month of August.\n\nThe economy of downtown Las Vegas has been primarily based on gambling and entertainment, as is the case in the greater Las Vegas Valley. However, the smaller downtown casinos earn revenues that pale in comparison to the mega resorts on the Las Vegas Strip further south. As of 2014, there have been major renovations of several downtown resorts such as The Plaza, Golden Gate Hotel, Golden Nugget, El Cortez Hotel & Casino, the D and the Downtown Grand.\n\nDowntown Las Vegas also houses some corporate offices, as well as the World Market Center Las Vegas, a frequent host of trade shows and conventions. Recently, the opening of the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health and the arrival of the new Zappos headquarters downtown has started to attract new medical and technology-oriented businesses to the area.\n\nThe downtown area in recent decades has played second fiddle to the larger and more famous Las Vegas Strip, which is located a few miles to the south. The city has been working on revitalization efforts to entice more visitors and residents to the downtown area.\n\nWorld Market Center Las Vegas consists of three giant buildings, with a total of 5.1 million square feet, in a facility designed by Jon Jerde. It is home to semiannual trade shows for the furniture and furnishing industries. This is one of several entities that are helping to diversity downtown Las Vegas' economy and job base.\n\nThe square footage of World Market Center Las Vegas is greater than both the Willis Tower in Chicago and the Empire State Building in New York City.\n\nThe city is also working to attract events to the downtown area. Recently held events include \"Helldorado\" and the \"Life is Beautiful\" festival.\n\nIn 2012 several new downtown projects were completed. The Smith Center for the Performing Arts, the new Mob Museum and a new City Hall building opened. The Discovery Children's Museum opened next door to The Smith Center in 2013.\n\nThe Las Vegas City Hall now operates out of a new building, which, along with the Bonneville Transit center, can serve as an anchor tenant for new development along Main Street. In addition, Main and Commerce streets in downtown Las Vegas are undergoing major beautification efforts, which started in mid-2014.\n\nOnline retailer Zappos made major renovations to the old Las Vegas City Hall, and moved into the building in late 2013, which now houses its corporate headquarters. Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh has taken a personal, as well as a professional, interest in the urban area and is contributing $350 million of his personal wealth toward a multifaceted revitalization effort called the Downtown Project, with businesses like The Writer's Block included among its investments.\n\n\n"}

As of 2009, there were approximately 3,000 students and 300 employees in the district.\n\n\nAshland's secondary schools include grades 6 through 8.\n\nAshland Middle School is the only public middle school located in Ashland, and has 623 students and 81 staff members. The school includes grades 6-8. The 2012 Oregon Report Card from the Oregon Department of Education rated Ashland Middle School as \"outstanding\".\n\nIn 2013, at 11:06 am, May 14, a fire broke out in the south wing of the school. Smoke was reported to be coming from the boys' bathroom. Investigators said an arsonist had started the fire. The school was cleared by 12:45, and students were let back into the north building. The student who started the fire was identified, and the Jackson County District Attorney's Office Juvenile Department handled the case.\n\nIn November 2014, an epidemic of chickenpox broke out at Ashland Middle School. 20 students were reported to have chickenpox, including two cases of pertussis. Only about 70% of students attending Ashland Middle School were vaccinated as of 2013.\n\n\n\nIn the 2009 school year, the district had 62 students classified as homeless by the Department of Education, which was 2.1% of students in the district.\n\n\nIn late 2001, Ashland School Board enacted a controversial drug and alcohol policy for leadership students. The local Oregon chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union had advocated on behalf of various students expelled by the Ashland School District for drug use in May 2001 at a national forensics tournament, and rallied again to protect the students from an unconstitutional invasion of their privacy. This landmark battle for students' rights was the first of many similar incidents across the country.\n\nStudents at Ashland High School argued that their off-campus behavior after school hours should have no effect on their academic standing. In a statement to the local press, Ashland High School Student Body Co-President Brady Brim-DeForest said, \"Teaching kids not to use and abuse drugs and alcohol is a family thing. Ultimately, it's a student's own personal choice.\"\n\nEventually, the code of conduct was rewritten and the controversy led to a full-scale re-evaluation of the school district's drug and alcohol policy. In order to reach consensus, a community committee was formed, which met consecutively for five months.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2095163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2095163", "title": "Park (Korean surname)", "text": "Park (Korean surname)\n\nPark or Bak (), is the third-most-common surname in Korea, traditionally traced back to King Hyeokgeose Park () and theoretically inclusive of all of his descendants. The name \"Park\" or \"Bak\" is usually assumed to come from the Korean noun \"Bak\" (), which means \"gourd.\" As of the South Korean census of 2015, there were 4,192,074 people by this name in South Korea or roughly 8.4% of the population.\n\nAll the Park clans in Korea trace their ancestry back to the first king of Silla, Hyeokgeose. According to a legend, the leaders of the six clans of the Jinhan confederacy were gathering on a hilltop to choose a king, when they looked down and saw lightning strike at the foot of the Yangsan mountain and a white horse bow at the same place. When they went there to check, they found a red egg, which hatched a baby boy. They bathed the boy in the nearby stream and he was emitting bright light and the sun and the moon rose at the same time, indicating the divine birth of the child. Thus the child was named Hyeokgeose, meaning \"ruling with a bright light\" and his clan name became Bak or \"gourd\" after the round shape of the egg he hatched from. At age 13 he was given the title geoseogan (거서간), the equivalent of \"king\" at the time. The birth legends of early Korean kings were necessary to validate the \"divine\" nature of their rule.\n\nAs with other Korean surnames, different lineages, known as bon-gwan or clans, are inherited from a father by his children. These designate the region of Korea or paternal ancestor, from which they claim to originate. Out of the kings of Silla, ten had the Park surname. During the rule of King Pasa (80–112), the Park clans became divided and during the reign of King Gyeongmyeong (917–924) they became even more fractured, creating several lineages. This is when the nine Park clans named after the nine sons of Gyeongmyeong came into existence.\n\n70–80% of the current bearers of the surname belong to the Miryang Bak clan. In 2015, there were 314 Bak clans in South Korea, with about 4.19 million people altogether.\n\nThe clans which produced the most number of notable people in Korean history are collectively called the \"8 Parks\", these are: the Miryang Park clan (밀양박씨), the Bannam Park clan (반남박씨), the Goryeong Park clan (고령박씨), the Hamyang Park clan (함양박씨), the Juksan Park clan (죽산박씨), the Suncheon Park clan (순천박씨), the Muan Park clan (무안박씨) and the Chungju Park clan (충주박씨).\n\nTraditionally, a man and a woman in the same clan could not marry, so the combination of the bon-gwan and the family name of a husband had to differ from those of his wife. Until 1997, this was also the law, but this was ruled unconstitutional.\n\nKing Hyeokgeose was said to have founded the Korean kingdom of Silla at the age of thirteen in 57 BC. Bak was one of three houses of the Korean kingdom of Silla. Among the houses of Bak, Gim, and Seok, princes rotated on the throne of Silla. According to historical records, all three houses have been recorded as having worshipped the founding father, Bak Hyeokgeose as their ancestral shrine. For example, the 4th king Talhae of Silla, the 9th king Beolhyu of Silla, the 10th king Naehae of Silla, the 11th king Jobun of Silla, the 12th king Cheomhae of Silla, the 14th King Yurye of Silla and the 15th king Girim of Silla were house of Seok, but according to the Samguk sagi Silla bongi, all of them worshipped Bak Hyeokgeose as their progenitor. In addition, the 13th king Michu of Silla, the 16th king Heulhae of Silla, the 17th king Naemul of Silla, the 18th king Silseong of Silla, the 19th king Nulji of Silla, the 20th king Jabi of Silla, the 21st king Soji of Silla, the 22nd king Jijeung of Silla, the 40th king Aejang of Silla, the 41st king Heondeok of Silla and the 42nd king Heungdeok of Silla are descendants of Gim Al-ji, but according to the Samguk sagi Silla bongi, all of them worshipped Bak Hyeokgeose as their progenitor. In addition, according to Samguk sagi, the Shrine Shingung(神宮) was founded in the birthplace of the progenitor Bak Hyeokgeose(朴赫居世) and every king has been recorded as paying their respects at this shrine. All of these historical records imply that the three lineages of Bak, Seok, and Gim worshipped Bak Hyeokgeose as their founding ancestor. \n\nWhen Seonggols have died out followed by two consecutive queens, Kim Chun-Chu from Jingol began to monopolize the throne, which lasts 258 years. However, even during this period, the Kims did not fully occupy the throne. In the later period of Silla, the Bak clan from Jingol succeed in restoring the throne. During the last century of the dynasty, the Bak clan from Jingol regained the ruling house position in 728 years. However, the Bak dynasty was cut off when Gyeongae of Silla was forced to commit suicide by Gyeon Hwon of the Hubaekje Kingdom. The reign of the Bak clan lasted only 15 years. After that, Gim Bu became the last king of Silla, but soon surrendered to the Wang Geon of Goryeo and Silla finally collapsed in 992 years.\n\nDuring the Unified Silla the Miryang Bak Clan, along with Gimhae Gim clan became the most prominent of the aristocracy, based on the bone rank system. Within the bone rank system, the two clans of Gimhae Gims and Miryang Baks were considered the most Jingol, or \"True Bone\". As Seong gol, or Divine bones died out through intermarriage, these two clans became the dominant noble houses on the peninsula following the conquest of rival dynasties.\n\nAfter the fall of Silla, it continued as a major noble house of Goryeo. During the Goryeo dynasty, many of the people who passed the highest-level state examination, which was implemented to recruit ranking officials during the Goryeo dynasty, were Parks. The first General to defeat the Mongols in world history was General Park Seo, who commanded the successful defense of the fortress of Guju in 1231 against the forces led by Mongol General Sartaq.\n\nDuring Joseon dynasty, Parks continued to thrive as one of the main Yangban households. With the Gabo Reform of 1894, when the caste system was abolished, some peasants adopted the surname of Park, bloating the population of the Park family.

Originally obtained from the Combe Down and Bathampton Down Mines under Combe Down, Somerset, England, its warm, honey colouring gives the World Heritage City of Bath, England, its distinctive appearance. An important feature of Bath Stone is that it is a 'freestone', so-called because it can be sawn or 'squared up' in any direction, unlike other rocks such as slate, which forms distinct layers.\n\nBath Stone has been used extensively as a building material throughout southern England, for churches, houses, and public buildings such as railway stations.\n\nSome quarries are still in use, but the majority have been converted to other purposes or are being filled in.\n\nBath Stone is an oolitic limestone comprising granular fragments of calcium carbonate laid down during the Jurassic Period (195 to 135 million years ago) when the region that is now Bath was under a shallow sea. Layers of marine sediment were deposited, and individual spherical grains were coated with lime as they rolled around the sea bed, forming the Bathonian Series of rocks. Under the microscope, these grains or ooliths (\"egg stones\") are sedimentary rock formed from ooids: spherical grains composed of concentric layers. That name derives from the Hellenic word \"òoion\" for egg. Strictly, oolites consist of ooids of diameter 0.25–2 mm. Rocks composed of ooids larger than 2 mm are called pisolites. They frequently contain minute fragments of shell or rock, and sometimes even decayed skeletons of marine life. Bath stone was taken from the Bath Oolite Member and the Combe Down Member of the Chalfield Oolite Formation, part of the Great Oolite Group.\n\nAn important feature of Bath Stone is that it is a freestone, that is one that can be sawn or 'squared up' in any direction, unlike other rocks such as slate, which forms distinct layers. In the Roman and Medieval periods, Bath Stone was extensively used on domestic, ecclesiastical and civil engineering projects such as bridges.\n\nThe Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases, which was founded in 1738, was designed by John Wood the Elder, and built with Bath stone donated by Allen. It is a Grade II listed building. There is a fine pediment on the building, in Bath stone, which depicts the parable of the good Samaritan.\n\nSt Stephens church, situated on Lansdown Hill in Bath, was constructed from a limestone sourced from the Limpley Stoke mine, which is situated in the Limpley Stoke Valley. The church has recently been restored.\n\nThe material has also been used widely outside Bath itself. Claverton Pumping Station at Claverton, which was built of Bath Stone in about 1810, pumps water from the River Avon to the Kennet and Avon Canal, using power from the flow of the River Avon. The stone was also used for the Dundas Aqueduct, which is long, and has three arches built of Bath Stone, with Doric pilasters, and balustrades at each end.\n\nMuch of Bristol Cathedral was built of Bath Stone, and the Wills Tower, which is the dominant feature of the Wills Memorial Building, is constructed in reinforced concrete faced with Bath and Clipsham stone. Bristol's Cabot Tower was also faced with Bath Stone. Arno's Court Triumphal Arch was built from Bath stone in about 1760, and was later dismantled before being rebuilt in its current location.\n\nBath Stone was also favoured by architect Hans Price, who designed much of 19th century Weston-super-Mare. In Barnstable, the 1855 construction of Butchers Row used Bath Stone.\n\nIn London, the neo-classical Georgian mansion Lancaster House was built from Bath Stone in 1825 for the Duke of York and Albany, the second son of King George III, as was St Luke's Church, Chelsea in 1824, and several other churches, including Church of Christ the King, Bloomsbury, were built from the material. Apsley House, the town house of the Dukes of Wellington, was remodelled by the 1st Duke, using in Bath Stone cladding over the original red brick.\n\nIn Reading, the original building of the Royal Berkshire Hospital of 1839, together with the wings added in the 1860s, are built of Bath Stone, with slate roofs. They are now listed grade II* by English Heritage. In 1860, the nearby Reading railway station, incorporating a tower and clock, was constructed by the Great Western Railway using Bath Stone, and the company also used it for Chippenham railway station.\nOther mansions which have used Bath Stone include: Gatcombe Park, Goldney Hall, Tyntesfield, South Hill Park, Spetchley Park.\n\nIn 2002 the East End of Truro Cathedral was completely renovated and restored with some of the ornate Bath Stone replaced with harder-wearing Syreford stone. In 2005 the West Front was restored similarly. Both projects were supervised by MRDA Architects of London, the Cathedral architects.\n\nBath Stone was mined underground at Combe Down and Bathampton Down Mines, in Somerset; and as a result of cutting the Box Tunnel, at various locations in Wiltshire, including Box and Corsham.\n\nIn the early 18th century, Ralph Allen promoted the use of the stone in Bath itself, and demonstrated its potential by using it for his own mansion at Prior Park. Following a failed bid to supply stone to buildings in London, Allen wanted a building which would show off the properties of Bath Stone as a building material.\nHe acquired the stone quarries at Combe Down and Bathampton Down Mines. Hitherto, the quarry masons had always hewn stone roughly providing blocks of varying size. Wood required stone blocks to be cut with crisp, clean edges for his distinctive classical façades. The distinctive honey-coloured Bath Stone was used to build the Georgian city. Stone was extracted by the \"room and pillar\" method, by which chambers were mined, leaving pillars of stone to support the roof. Allen built a railway line from his mine on Combe Down which carried the stone down the hill, now known as Ralph Allen Drive, which runs beside Prior Park, to a wharf he constructed at Bath Locks on the Kennet and Avon Canal to transport stone to London.\n\nIn the 18th century mines at Budbury near Bradford on Avon and Corsham the mines were developed by the Methuen and Northey families. The mine at Monkton Farleigh was leased to quarrymen by the Diocese of Salisbury.\n\nUnderground extraction of Bath Stone continues in the Corsham area but on a smaller scale than previously. For example, Hanson Bath & Portland Stone, part of the HeidelbergCement Group, operates Hartham Park Underground Quarry in the Hudswell district (southwest of Pickwick). The Bath Stone Group operates the Stoke Hill mine.\n\nThe Box Mine consists of a network of tunnels, which originate from stone mining work. Stone extraction started during the Roman occupation of Britain and ceased in 1968. The mine is now popular for recreational underground trips, and is home to a large population of bats. Up to 10% of the total British population of greater horseshoe bat uses the mine at times, and a maximum of 230 individuals of the species have been counted at the site. The Lesser Horseshoe Bat also uses the mine, as do the four Myotis species: Whiskered, Brandt's, Natterer's and Daubenton's bats.\n\nCombe Down and Bathampton Down Mines date from the 17th and 18th century when stone was extracted by the \"room and pillar\" method, by which chambers were mined, leaving pillars of stone between them to support the roof. The mine contains a range of mine features including well preserved tramways, cart-roads and crane bases. The walls and pillars of the mine are studded with pick and tool marks, and show evidence of the use of huge stone saws, all of which bear testimony to the variety of techniques used to extract the stone over the mine's three hundred-year history. No mine abandonment plans of either the tunnels or the caverns, known as voids, were made prior to the 1872 Mining Act. Following their closure, the mines were used for a variety of purposes, including a mushroom farm, and as an air-raid shelter during the World War II Baedeker raids on Bath.\n\nDuring the 1930s there was a recognition of a need to provide secure storage for munitions in the south of the United Kingdom, and a large area of the quarries around the Corsham area was renovated by the Royal Engineers as one of three major munitions stockpiles. This ammunition depot was serviced by a spur railway line from the main London to Bristol line, branching off just outside the eastern entrance to Box Tunnel. A portion of the underground quarry complex was developed as a 'shadow factory' for aircraft engines, to act as a fallback should the Bristol Engine company Factory at Filton be taken out of action by hostile bombing. In practice this factory was never used.\nIn another part of the quarry area, Royal Air Force Box was established as the Headquarters of No10 Fighter Group, Royal Air Force. RAF Box was later renamed RAF Rudloe Manor and expanded to encompass a number of communications functions, including No1 Signal Unit, Controller Defence Communications Network, No1001 Signal Unit Detachment and Headquarters RAF Provost & Security Service. No1SU and CDCN were both housed in bunkers within the quarry complex, which also included an RAF Regional Command Centre for the South West of England.\n\nBritish defence doctrine during the early Cold War period indicated a requirement for a fallback location for central government outside London, to assume national control in the event of London being destroyed. The quarry complex at Corsham was chosen for this location and development of the site commenced in the 1950s. In the event of an imminent nuclear attack, it was assumed that the government would be evacuated from London by rail or helicopter. The facility would provide a safe haven for the Prime Minister, the Cabinet, commanders of the Royal Air Force, Royal Navy, and British Army and supporting civil servants and military personnel. Facilities inside the complex included accommodation and catering for nearly 4,000 people, including a hospital, organic electrical generation and the ability to seal the complex from the outside environment, contaminated by radiation or other threat.\n\nThe defence facilities known by various code names like Stockwell, Turnstile, Hawthorn and Burlington have been built in quarries include Military Command & Control, storage and a fallback seat of national government. Some areas of the quarry complex were hardened and provided with support measures to ensure resilience in the event of a nuclear attack. The site was decommissioned and placed in a state of care & maintenance in the mid 1990s following the fragmentation of the Soviet Union and the end of the cold war. The site has been offered for sale, conditional on a Private Finance Initiative for the continued use of above ground facilities.\n\nCorsham Computer Centre was built into Hudswell Quarry during the 1980s and current examples of other uses include not only defence establishments, but also a wine cellar at Eastlays (near Gastard) and storage for magnetic media (for Off-site Data Protection) at Monk's Park (near Neston).\n\nThe mine at Monkton Farleigh was used as a Central Ammunition Depot during World War II. Part of the site which was not used by the military is now a part of the Brown's Folly site of special scientific interest.\n\nDuring 1989 a utilities contractor unexpectedly broke through into part of the mines complex at Combe Down whilst excavating a trench. This raised concerns locally, resulting in the then Bath City Council commissioning studies to survey the condition of the mines. It was clear that the mines were in a very dangerous state and some experts considered them to be the largest, shallowest, and most unstable of their kind in Europe. Approximately 80% of the mines, which are up to high and cover a total area of about , had less than cover and as little as in some places.\n\nIn March 1999, the then Department of Environment, Transport and Regions (DETR), now known as the Department for Communities and Local Government, announced a Land Stabilisation Programme, based on the Derelict Land Act 1982. A Parliamentary Statutory Instrument (2002 No. 2053) was needed before the work could be undertaken. Foam Concrete was selected as the best material to use in the large-scale infilling of the old mine workings. Over of foamed concrete were placed in the shallower underground mines, making it the single largest application of foamed concrete in the United Kingdom.\n"}

Ions, or charged atomic particles, can be confined and suspended in free space using electromagnetic fields. Qubits are stored in stable electronic states of each ion, and quantum information can be transferred through the collective quantized motion of the ions in a shared trap (interacting through the Coulomb force). Lasers are applied to induce coupling between the qubit states (for single qubit operations) or coupling between the internal qubit states and the external motional states (for entanglement between qubits).\n\nThe fundamental operations of a quantum computer have been demonstrated experimentally with the currently highest accuracy in trapped ion systems. Promising schemes in development to scale the system to arbitrarily large numbers of qubits include transporting ions to spatially distinct locations in an array of ion traps, building large entangled states via photonically connected networks of remotely entangled ion chains, and combinations of these two ideas. This makes the trapped ion quantum computer system one of the most promising architectures for a scalable, universal quantum computer. As of April 2018, the largest number of particles to be controllably entangled is 20 trapped ions.\n\nThe electrodynamic ion trap currently used in trapped ion quantum computing research was invented in the 1950s by Wolfgang Paul (who received the Nobel Prize for his work in 1989). Charged particles cannot be trapped in 3D by just electrostatic forces because of Earnshaw's theorem. Instead, an electric field oscillating at radio frequency (RF) is applied, forming a potential with the shape of a saddle spinning at the RF frequency. If the RF field has the right parameters (oscillation frequency and field strength), the charged particle becomes effectively trapped at the saddle point by a restoring force, with the motion described by a set of Mathieu equations.\n\nThis saddle point is the point of minimized energy magnitude, formula_1, for the ions in the potential field. The Paul trap is often described as a harmonic potential well that traps ions in two dimensions (assume formula_2 and formula_3 without loss of generality) and does not trap ions in the formula_4 direction. When multiple ions are at the saddle point and the system is at equilibrium, the ions are only free to move in formula_4. Therefore, the ions will repel each other and create a vertical configuration in formula_4, the simplest case being a linear strand of only a few ions. Coulomb interactions of increasing complexity will create a more intricate ion configuration if many ions are initialized in the same trap. Furthermore, the additional vibrations of the added ions greatly complicate the quantum system, which makes initialization and computation more difficult.\n\nOnce trapped, the ions should be cooled such that formula_7(see Lamb Dicke regime). This can be achieved by a combination of Doppler cooling and Resolved sideband cooling. At this very low temperature, vibrational energy in the ion trap is quantized into phonons by the energy eigenstates of the ion strand, which are called the center of mass vibrational modes. A single phonon's energy is given by the relation formula_8. These quantum states occur when the trapped ions vibrate together and are completely isolated from the external environment. If the ions are not properly isolated, noise can result from ions interacting with external electromagnetic fields, which creates random movement and destroys the quantized energy states.\n\nThe first implementation scheme for a controlled-NOT quantum gate was proposed by Ignacio Cirac and Peter Zoller in 1995, specifically for the trapped ion system. The same year, a key step in the controlled-NOT gate was experimentally realized at NIST Ion Storage Group, and research in quantum computing began to take off worldwide. Many traditional ion trapping research groups have made the transition to quantum computing research, while, more recently, many other new research groups have joined the effort. An enormous amount of progress in this field has been made in the past decade and trapped ions remain a leading candidate for quantum computation.\n\nThe full requirements for a functional quantum computer are not entirely known, but there are many generally accepted requirements. DiVincenzo outlined several of these criterion for quantum computing (see DiVincenzo's criteria).\n\nAny two-level quantum system can form a qubit, and there are two predominant ways to form a qubit using the electronic states of an ion:\n\n\nHyperfine qubits are extremely long-lived (decay time of the order of thousands to millions of years) and phase/frequency stable (traditionally used for atomic frequency standards). Optical qubits are also relatively long-lived (with a decay time of the order of a second), compared to the logic gate operation time (which is of the order of microseconds). The use of each type of qubit poses its own distinct challenges in the laboratory.\n\nIonic qubit states can be prepared in a specific qubit state using a process called optical pumping. In this process, a laser couples the ion to some excited states which eventually decay to one state which is not coupled to the laser. Once the ion reaches that state, it has no excited levels to couple to in the presence of that laser and, therefore, remains in that state. If the ion decays to one of the other states, the laser will continue to excite the ion until it decays to the state that does not interact with the laser. This initialization process is standard in many physics experiments and can be performed with extremely high fidelity (>99.9%).\n\nThe system's initial state for quantum computation can therefore be described by the ions in their hyperfine and motional ground states, resulting in an initial center of mass phonon state of formula_9(zero phonons).\n\nMeasuring the state of the qubit stored in an ion is quite simple. Typically, a laser is applied to the ion that couples only one of the qubit states. When the ion collapses into this state during the measurement process, the laser will excite it, resulting in a photon being released when the ion decays from the excited state. After decay, the ion is continually excited by the laser and repeatedly emits photons. These photons can be collected by a photomultiplier tube (PMT) or a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. If the ion collapses into the other qubit state, then it does not interact with the laser and no photon is emitted. By counting the number of collected photons, the state of the ion may be determined with a very high accuracy (>99.9%).\n\nOne of the requirements of universal quantum computing is to coherently change the state of a single qubit. For example, this can transform a qubit starting out in 0 into any arbitrary superposition of 0 and 1 defined by the user. In a trapped ion system, this is often done using magnetic dipole transitions or stimulated Raman transitions for hyperfine qubits and electric quadrupole transitions for optical qubits. The term \"rotation\" alludes to the Bloch sphere representation of a qubit pure state. Gate fidelity can be greater than 99%.\n\nThe operations formula_10and formula_11can be applied to individual ions by manipulating the frequency of an external electromagnetic field from and exposing the ions to the field for specific amounts of time. These controls create a Hamiltonian of the form formula_12. Here, formula_13and formula_14are the raising and lowering operators of spin (see Ladder operator). These rotations are the universal building blocks for single-qubit gates in quantum computing.\n\nTo obtain the Hamiltonian for the ion-laser interaction, apply the Jaynes–Cummings model. Once the Hamiltonian is found, the formula for the unitary operation performed on the qubit can be derived using the principles of quantum time evolution. Although this model utilizes the Rotating wave approximation, it proves to be effective for the purposes of trapped-ion quantum computing.\n\nBesides the controlled-NOT gate proposed by Cirac and Zoller in 1995, many equivalent, but more robust, schemes have been proposed and implemented experimentally since. Recent theoretical work by Garcia-Ripoll, Cirac, and Zoller have shown that there are no fundamental limitations to the speed of entangling gates, but gates in this impulsive regime (faster than 1 microsecond) have not yet been demonstrated experimentally. The fidelity of these implementations has been greater than 99%.\n\nQuantum computers must be capable of initializing, storing, and manipulating many qubits at once in order to solve difficult computational problems. However, as previously discussed, a finite number of qubits can be stored in each trap while still maintaining their computational abilities. It is therefore necessary to design interconnected ion traps that are capable of transferring information from one trap to another. Ions can be separated from the same interaction region to individual storage regions and brought back together without losing the quantum information stored in their internal states. Ions can also be made to turn corners at a \"T\" junction, allowing a two dimensional trap array design. Semiconductor fabrication techniques have also been employed to manufacture the new generation of traps, making the 'ion trap on a chip' a reality. An example is the quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) designed by Kielpinski, Monroe, and Wineland. QCCDs resemble mazes of electrodes with designated areas for storing and manipulating qubits.\n\nThe variable electric potential created by the electrodes can both trap ions in specific regions and move them through the transport channels, which negates the necessity of containing all ions in a single trap. Ions in the QCCD's memory region are isolated from any operations and therefore the information contained in their states is kept for later use. Gates, including those that entangle two ion states, are applied to qubits in the interaction region by the method already described in this article.\n\nWhen an ion is being transported between regions in an interconnected trap and is subjected to a nonuniform magnetic field, decoherence can occur in the form of the equation below (see Zeeman effect). This is effectively changes the relative phase of the quantum state. The up and down arrows correspond to a general superposition qubit state, in this case the ground and excited states of the ion.\n\nformula_15\n\nAdditional relative phases could arise from physical movements of the trap or the presence of unintended electric fields. If the user could determine the parameter α, accounting for this decoherence would be relatively simple, as known quantum information processes exist for correcting a relative phase. However, since α from the interaction with the magnetic field is path-dependent, the problem is highly complex. Considering the multiple ways that decoherence of a relative phase can be introduced in an ion trap, reimagining the ion state in a new basis that minimizes decoherence could be a way to eliminate the issue.\n\nOne way to combat decoherence is to represent the quantum state in a new basis called the Decoherence Free Subspace, or DFS., with basis states formula_16 and formula_17. The DFS is actually the subspace of two ion states, such that if both ions acquire the same relative phase, the total quantum state in the DFS will be unaffected.\n\nTrapped ion quantum computers theoretically meet all of DiVincenzo's criteria for quantum computing, but implementation of the system can be quite difficult. The main challenges facing trapped ion quantum computing are the initialization of the ion's motional states, and the relatively brief lifetimes of the phonon states. Decoherence also proves to be challenging to eliminate, and is caused when the qubits interact with the external environment undesirably.\n\nThe Controlled NOT gate is a crucial component for quantum computing, as any quantum gate can be created by a combination of CNOT gates and single-qubit rotations. It is therefore important that a trapped-ion quantum computer can perform this operation by meeting the following three requirements.\n\nFirst, the trapped ion quantum computer must be able to perform arbitrary rotations on qubits, which are already discussed in the \"arbitrary single-qubit rotation\" section.\n\nThe next component of a CNOT gate is the controlled phase-flip gate, or the controlled-Z gate (see Quantum logic gate). In a trapped ion quantum computer, the state of the center of mass phonon functions as the control qubit, and the internal atomic spin state of the ion is the working qubit. The phase of the working qubit will therefore be flipped if the phonon qubit is in the state formula_18.\n\nLastly, a SWAP gate must be implemented, acting on both the ion state and the phonon state.\n\nTwo alternate schemes to represent the CNOT gates are presented in Chuang's \"Quantum Computation and Quantum Information\" and Cirac and Zoller's \"Quantum Computation with Cold_trapped Ions\".\n\n"}

It was a single-engined seaplane with two large floats. It was piloted by John Cyril Porte, the managing director of the company, and took off from the deep water channel to the south of the island. It had a successful ten-minute flight.\n\nOsea Island was the site of a Coastal Motor Torpedo Boat base during the First World War and 2,000 sailors were billeted there, mainly in temporary huts which were removed after the war. Augustus Agar was awarded the Victoria Cross while stationed on the island and detailed his experiences in his book \"Baltic Episode\".\n\nIn the Second World War, the island was occupied by the British Army.\n\nThe 1979 Children's Film Foundation film \"Black Island\", produced by Kingsgate Films and directed by Ben Bolt, was shot on and around the island. The film is about two young castaways who are captured by escaped convicts on the island and their subsequent escape attempts.\n\nBoth the 1989 television adaptation of Susan Hill's novel \"The Woman in Black\" and the 2012 film adaptation of the same used the island's causeway as the location for the fictional Nine Lives Causeway.\n\nThe island was used for auditions on the ITV1 show \"Superstar\", filmed in early 2012, in which it was known as Superstar Island. It was the second episode and included eliminations. Andrew Lloyd Webber was casting for a new lead role, in his production of Jesus Christ Superstar. Melanie Chisholm, Dawn French and Jason Donovan were also on the panel.\n\nOsea Island holds a place in the history of drug and alcohol treatment in Britain. It was formerly owned by a member of the Charrington brewing family, Frederick Nicholas Charrington, who also founded the Tower Hamlets Mission, which continues to house a drug and alcohol treatment centre, Charis.\n\nCharrington established a retreat for wealthy alcoholics on Osea Island, among whom it is rumoured that Walter Sickert was included.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2010, it was a rehabilitation centre specialising in the treatment of addiction problems and mental health called the Causeway Retreat, managed by former nurse Brendan Quinn. In 2008, Amy Winehouse attended the rehab clinic on the island.\n\nThe Causeway Retreat was refused registration on 30 September 2010 by the Care Quality Commission, and Brendan Quinn was suspended as a nurse by the Nursing and Midwifery Council on 20 September 2010. On 19 November 2010 Brendan Quinn's Twenty 7 Management, which had run the Causeway Retreat, pleaded guilty at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court, and was fined £8,000 plus £30,000 costs for running an unlicensed hospital. District Judge David Cooper said the firm's standards \"would really shame a third world country\".\n\nThe island is used by musicians as a private retreat to record albums. It has its own fully equipped recording studio as well as ample accommodation.\n\n"}

Richard Winters. After linking up with his parent unit at the hamlet of Le Grand Chemin on the morning of 6 June 1944, Winters was ordered away from his company. With minimal instructions of \"There's fire along that hedgerow there. Take care of it,\" and no briefing, Winters found himself given the task of destroying a German artillery battery. \n\nThe battery had initially been reported to be 10.5 cm leFH 18s firing onto causeway exit #2 leading off Utah Beach and disrupting landing forces of the U.S. 4th Infantry Division advancing inland on this route. Several other units had stumbled onto the German position earlier in the morning and had been repulsed.\n\nWinters undertook a reconnaissance at about 0830hrs, after which he collected a team of 12 men from his own and other companies. Beyond knowledge of the general location of the gun emplacements south of Le Grand Chemin and without information of the other side of the hedgerow, Winters' team attacked Brécourt Manor, located three miles southwest of Utah Beach and north of the village of Sainte-Marie-du-Mont. There he discovered No. 6 Battery of the 90th Artillery Regiment, consisting of four 105 mm howitzers connected by trenches and defended by a company of soldiers.\n\nWinters believed that the unit was part of the 6th \"Fallschirmjägerregiment\" (\"6th Parachute Regiment\") with emplaced MG42 machine guns. The 1st battalion of the 6th had been ordered to Sainte Marie-du-Mont from Carentan during the afternoon but arrived after dark. The 1st Company 919th Grenadier Regiment (709th Infantry Division) was posted at Sainte Marie-du-Mont and was responsible for the area. Elements of 1058th Grenadier Regiment (91st \"Luftlandedivision\") were defending throughout the vicinity, and the artillery was part of this division also. The 795th Georgian Battalion, attached to the 709th ID, was to the northwest at Turqueville but is less likely to have been present because of terrain difficulties. Whichever unit defended the battery, the U.S. paratroopers were opposed by about 60 German soldiers.\n\nThe crew originally assigned to the four 105mm guns had apparently deserted during the night of the airborne landings. Oberstleutnant Friedrich von der Heydte of the German 6th Parachute Regiment, who was observing the landings at Utah Beach, learned that they had been abandoned, and traveled to Carentan, where he ordered his 1st Battalion to occupy and hold Sainte-Marie-du-Mont and Brécourt, and find men to work on the artillery battery.\n\nUpon arrival at the battery location, Winters made his plan: he positioned a pair of M1919 machine guns for covering fire and sent several soldiers (2d Lt. Lynn D. Compton, Pvt. Donald Malarkey and Sgt. William J. Guarnere) to one flank to destroy a machine gun position with grenades and provide covering fire.\n\nWhile the trenches connecting the artillery positions provided the Germans with an easy way to supply and reinforce the guns, they also proved to be their biggest weakness. After destroying the first gun position, Winters and the rest of his team used the trenches as covered approaches to attack the remaining guns in turn. Each gun was destroyed by placing a block of TNT down its barrel and using German stick grenades to set off the charges.\n\nReinforcements from Company D, led by 2d Lt. Ronald C. Speirs, arrived to complete the assault on the fourth and last gun. Speirs had a reputation as an excellent and extremely aggressive officer, and he led his men against the last gun position by running outside the trenches, exposing himself to enemy fire.\n\nAfter the four guns were disabled, Winters's team came under heavy machine-gun fire from Brécourt Manor and withdrew. He had discovered a German map in one gun position that was marked with the locations of all German artillery and machine gun positions throughout that area of the Cotentin Peninsula. This was an invaluable piece of intelligence, and once Winters returned to Le Grand Chemin, he passed it on to the 2nd Battalion intelligence officer (S-2), who passed the information up the chain of command. Command was so thrilled with the information provided by Winters that it sent the first two tanks to reach Utah Beach to support the paratroopers. \n\nWinters also directed the fire of two American tanks which arrived later from Utah Beach to eliminate remaining German resistance.\n\nWinters lost one man, Pfc. John D. Halls (of A Company) from an 81mm mortar platoon; another, Private Robert \"Popeye\" Wynn, was wounded during the attack. Another casualty was Warrant Officer Andrew Hill, who was killed when he came upon the battle while searching for the headquarters of the 506th PIR. Also killed were Sgt. \"Rusty\" Houck from F Company, who was with Speirs, and one soldier from D Company under Speirs' command. Another soldier from D Company was wounded.\n\nTroops landing at Utah Beach had a relatively easy landing, due in part to this successful assault. Colonel Robert Sink, the commander of the 506th PIR, recommended Winters for the Medal of Honor, but the award was downgraded to the Distinguished Service Cross because there was a policy of awarding only one Medal of Honor per division; in the 101st's case, to Lieutenant Colonel Robert G. Cole. There was later a campaign to upgrade Winters' Distinguished Service Cross to the Medal of Honor, but a bill to do so, H.R. 796, died in committee at the end of the 110th United States Congress. It was not reintroduced by its sponsor, Tim Holden.\n\nThe official Army history of these events on D-Day is quiet about the battle. Army historian S. L. A. Marshall interviewed Winters about the attack, but the interview was not private – many of Winters' superior officers were present – and, according to his memoir \"Beyond Band of Brothers\", he may have downplayed his description of the event to avoid personal accolade and to keep the account succinct. In fact, Marshall stated in his report that Winters had about 200 men under his command. However, nearly every man involved was later recognized for his role in the attack.\n\nA documentary produced by filmmaker and trial attorney Vance Day titled \"\"The Battle at Brecourt Manor\"\" was premiered in August 2010 in Salem, Oregon during an event for Donald Malarkey who served in Easy Company and during the engagement at Brecourt Manor. Day is a good friend of Malarkey's and the two traveled extensively to conduct Frontline Leadership seminars around the country, primarily for law enforcement, military, and leadership organizations. Lynn \"Buck\" Compton also was regularly involved in both events for Frontline Leadership and \"The Battle at Brecourt Manor\" showings.\n\nDistinguished Service Cross\n\nSilver Star\n\nBronze Star\n\nPurple Heart\n\n"}

The feature is centered at 30.5° North Latitude, 326.8° West Longitude and is approximately 383 kilometers long. Samarkand Sulci consists of three parts. The southern and eastern extensions bound Sarandib Planitia on its western and northern sides, respectively. The northern portions extends into a region of cratered terrain.\n\nUsing \"Voyager 2\" images, Kargel and Pozio (1996) found that the northern and southern/eastern extensions of this feature are likely distinct features with different origins and ages. The portions surrounding Sarandib Planitia were characterized as sinuous \"mountainous ridges\" 1-1.5 km in height, and lying within relative topographic lows. Kargel and Pozio (1996) suggested that they might be fold belts, similar to North America's Appalachian Mountains. The northern portion of Samarkand Sulci was found to consist of linear fractures, suggesting that rather than a compressional fold belt, the northern part of Samarkand Sulci may in fact be an extensional rift. Based on analysis of crater counts in both areas of Samarkand Sulci, Kargel and Pozio (1996) suggested that the rift formed before the ridges.\n\nRecent images by the \"Cassini\" spacecraft show portions of Samarkand Sulci at much higher resolution than in the \"Voyager 2\" images. Numerous parallel ridges are resolved in the southern and eastern extensions of the feature, though some ridges appear chevron shaped. Just as Kargel and Pozio (1996) found parts of this feature lying within topographic lows, sharp scarps bound the ridge belts in several regions. On the far eastern tip of Samarkand Sulci, these scarps begin to converge as the ridge belts disappear, forming narrow canyons. Northern Samarkand Sulci was also observed. This region appears unconsolidated with several craters, like Ahmad and Peri-Banu, appearing to be cross-cut or even flooded by this portion of Samarkand Sulci.\n\nNear the southern end of Samarkand Sulci, curious dark patches, 500–750 m across were observed lying along ridge crests. It is possible these spots may be collapse pits.\n\nSamarkand Sulci is named after the country ruled over by Shah Zaman, brother of Shahryar, in \"Arabian Nights\".\n"}

The screen will often scroll horizontally or even diagonally, depending on the course the protagonist must take to reach the demon leader. Each character has a limited bomb attack in the form of an energy blast that can be sent in any direction, and will dispel any bullets it touches. Another special attack involves sending the shikigami into the midst of the enemies, with two particular advantages. First, the shikigami does not have to attack in the same direction as the player is firing, and can even get past obstacles that would otherwise thwart normal shots. If an enemy projectile touches the shikigami, it will change to a pink color and will drastically slow down. If the shot passes the shikigami, it will return to its original color and resume at full speed; however, if the bullet is caught in an explosion, it will be cancelled and turned into coins.\n\nScore is almost entirely dependent on the continuous, uninterrupted collection of coins. The player must constantly damage or destroy enemies in order to replenish a countdown timer; when the timer (represented by a meter in the upper-left corner of the screen) depletes entirely, the player's coin count returns to zero. Guwange is unique in that the player may maintain a \"chain\" of coin collection throughout the entire game, instead of a more conventional stage-by-stage approach. This makes Guwange's scoring system extremely unforgiving.\n\n\n\nThe story of \"Guwange\" is set during the Muromachi period of Japan. During this time, increasing numbers of people suffer possession by shikigami. Although the shikigami grant great spiritual powers, the strain inflicted on the host causes them to die exactly one year after possession. However, a legend has sprung up regarding Guwange, the malevolent god trapped in Mt. Gokumon (i.e. Hell Gate). If one possessed by a shikigami can gather talismans of the five Chinese elements—wood, fire, earth, metal, water—from five demons serving Guwange, then infiltrate Gokumon and slay Guwange, the shikigami will be destroyed and the one possessed will not suffer a premature death.\n\n\nEach player gets a unique introduction, and ending after completing the game.\n\nThe 'blue label' version of the game was originally a promotional item given to the three highest scoring players at a Cave hosted event. On December 30, 2007 Cave fest, Cave unveiled a special edition of the game, which included increased difficulty in later chapters. The arcade game eventually appeared in cabinet format.\n\nCave released soundtrack for the game under the title \"Guwange/ESP Ra.De. original soundtrack album\".\n\nThe mobile version was split into two separate games:\n\nGuwange DX is a version for mobile platforms in which the two-part mobile game was merged into a single game, with enhanced graphics.\n\nDeveloped by 5pb.

The follow-up to her commercially successful album \"The Colour of My Love\" (1993) and French-language \"D'eux\" (1995), \"Falling into You\" showed a further progression of Dion's music. Throughout the project, she collaborated with Jim Steinman, who wrote and produced \"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\", among others. Several songs were produced by David Foster, including Diane Warren's \"Because You Loved Me\". Generally, Dion worked with fourteen producers on \"Falling into You\" and a variety of songwriters and musicians.\n\n\"Falling into You\" won many awards around the world, including Grammy Award for Album of the Year and Best Pop Album at the 39th annual ceremony, during which Dion performed live. In April 1997, she also won three World Music Awards for World's Best Selling Artist of the Year, World's Best Selling Pop Artist of the Year and World's Best Selling Canadian Artist of the Year. The album is on Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's Definitive 200 list.\n\n\"Falling into You\" became one of the best-selling albums in history, with sales of over 32 million copies worldwide. It topped the charts around the world, including number one in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, France, Australia and many more. It became one of the best-selling albums of 1996 and 1997 in various countries and also one of the top-selling albums of the decade. It was certified Diamond, Multi-Platinum, Platinum and Gold around the world. The album has sold eleven million copies in the US, over two million in the United Kingdom, and over one million in Germany, France, Canada and Australia. In Europe, it has sold over nine million units.\n\nFive singles were released from the album in Europe, four in Australia, and three in North America. The major success came with the release of \"Because You Loved Me\", theme from \"Up Close & Personal\" (number one in the United States, Canada and Australia), \"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\" (number one in Canada, Belgium and number two in the US), and Eric Carmen's \"All by Myself\" (top ten in various countries, including number four in the US).\n\n\"Falling into You\" presented Dion at the height of her popularity, and showed a further progression of her music. The album combines many elements: ornate orchestral frills and African chanting, and instruments like the violin, Spanish guitar, trombone, the cavaquinho, saxophone and supreme string arrangements, which created a new sound. The singles also encompassed a variety of musical styles. \"Falling into You\" (originally by Marie-Claire D'Ubaldo) and \"River Deep, Mountain High\" (Ike & Tina Turner's cover) made prominent use of percussion instruments. \"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\" (originally by Pandora's Box) and \"All by Myself\" (Eric Carmen's cover) kept their soft-rock atmosphere, but were combined with the classical sound of the piano.\n\nThe ballad, \"Because You Loved Me\", written by Diane Warren, served as the theme to the 1996 film \"Up Close & Personal\". The album also includes English adaptations of songs from \"D'eux\": \"If That's What It Takes\" (\"Pour que tu m'aimes encore\"), \"I Don't Know\" (\"Je sais pas\") and \"Fly\" (\"Vole\"). Outside North America, \"Falling into You\" also features a cover of Carole King's \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\". In Asia, the Japanese hit \"To Love You More\" was added as well. Additionally, the non-US editions of the album include \"Your Light\", written and produced by Aldo Nova and the Spanish/Latin America editions feature \"Sola Otra Vez\", a Spanish-language version of \"All by Myself\". Dion worked on \"Falling into You\" with many producers, mainly with Jim Steinman, David Foster, Ric Wake, Jean-Jacques Goldman and Humberto Gatica.\n\n\"Falling into You\" divided music critics. \"Billboard\" editor Paul Verna gave it a positive review. He called it a deep album that will solidify Dion's reputation as one of the world's true pop divas. Verna highlighted the chart-topping \"Because You Loved Me\" and other hit-worthy moments on the album: a Meat Loaf-style epic \"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\", the laid back \"Falling into You\", bouncy pop \"Make You Happy\", sultry ballad \"Seduces Me\" (produced by Duran Duran producer, John Jones), and effervescent \"Declaration of Love\". Another critic from \"Billboard\" spoke positively about \"Because You Loved Me\" and \"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\", writing that \"Because You Loved Me\" is \"rife with grand romance, larger-than-life production, and a climax that is best described as the musical equivalent to 4th of July fireworks\". The same critic called \"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\" a ballad that pits Dion against the bombastic production of Jim Steinman, adding that \"lesser talents might have been gobbled up by this melodramatic arrangements, but Dion rises to the occasion with a performance that soars above the instrumentation with deliciously theatrical flair\".\n\nA positive review also came from senior editor of AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine, who gave \"Falling into You\" four stars out of five. Although he noted that the album is formulaic, Erlewine appreciated its well-executed, stylish, and catchy formula, accentuating Dion's natural vocal charm. He praised ballads like \"Because You Loved Me\" and mock epics like \"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\". He felt that Dion tackles dance-pop and love songs with grace and that effortless elegance saves the mediocre material on the album from being tedious. According to him, there are a couple of weak tracks on \"Falling into You\" but it is a remarkably well-crafted set of adult contemporary pop and Dion's best album. Chuck Eddy from \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave it a B in his review. Eddy wrote: \"There's something compellingly eccentric about even the mushiest ballads on Celine Dion's new set \"Falling into You\", which features Spanish guitars, African chanting, and ornate orchestral frills. But only in her desolate cover of Eric Carmen's \"All by Myself\" and her brutal blues-mama dance \"Declaration of Love\" (which kicks like Bonnie Raitt and Wynonna only wish they could) does she truly crash through the glass ceiling of passion\".\n\nMixed or negative reviews came from Elysa Gardner of the \"Los Angeles Times\", Stephen Holden of \"The New York Times\" and Dan Leroy of Yahoo! Music. Gardner gave the album two out of four stars and wrote that Dion \"dabbles in more soulful and sophisticated textures, and at times her dilettantism pays off. But she often falls back on her characteristic platform of polite, predictable schmaltz\". Holden wrote that the album is \"crammed with formulaic romantic bombast. The melodrama peaks with two overblown Jim Steinman productions: \"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\", a romantic flashback replete with thunderclaps, and \"River Deep, Mountain High\", an anemic remake of a classic Phil Spector production\". However, he praised \"Because You Loved Me\" (calling it this year's \"Wind Beneath My Wings\") and a remake of Carmen's 1976 hit, \"All by Myself\". Leroy said that \"trying to out-emote Eric Carmen was almost crazy enough to work, and working with over-the-top Meat Loaf collaborator Jim Steinman seemed a sensible choice. But the results weren't much different than usual\". \"The Rolling Stone Album Guide\" gave the album one and a half stars out of five.\n\n\"Falling into You\" remains one of the best-selling albums of all time, with sales of over thirty-two million copies. In Canada, \"Falling into You\" became Dion's second number-one album, after \"The Colour of My Love\".

{"id": "2095237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2095237", "title": "Old Montreal", "text": "Old Montreal\n\nOld Montreal (French: \"Vieux-Montréal\") is a historic neighbourhood within the municipality of Montreal in the province of Quebec, Canada. Founded by French settlers in 1642 as Fort Ville-Marie, Old Montreal is home to many structures dating back to the era of New France. The 17th century settlement lends its name to the borough in which the neighbourhood lies, Ville-Marie. Home to the Old Port of Montreal, the neighbourhood is bordered on the west by McGill Street, on the north by Ruelle des Fortifications, on the east by rue Saint-André, and on the south by the Saint Lawrence River. Following recent amendments, the neighbourhood has expanded to include the Rue des Soeurs Grises in the west, Saint Antoine Street in the north, and Saint Hubert Street in the east. In 1964, much of Old Montreal was declared a historic district by the Ministère des Affaires culturelles du Québec.\n\nIn 1605, Samuel de Champlain established a fur-trading post at Place Royale (Old Montreal) at the confluence of the Saint Lawrence River and the Petite Rivière St-Pierre, a former river in the area. It was adjacent to present-day Place D'Youville and the Pointe-à-Callière Museum. However, the settlers were later forced to abandon the outpost due to incursions by the Iroquois.\n\nThe original settlement of Montreal was founded in 1642. It was known as Ville-Marie, and was located in roughly the same location as the trading post set up by de Champlain. The founder, Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve, built a fort in 1643 which would serve as the headquarters for the Société Notre-Dame de Montréal, an organization whose mission was to convert members of First Nations to Christianity and establish a Christian settlement in New France. The company in charge of managing the settlement was founded by the Sulpician Jean-Jacques Olier and by Jérôme Le Royer (Sieur de La Dauversière).\n\nAfter the Société Notre-Dame dissolved on March 9, 1663, the Sulpicians (who arrived in 1657) became the Seigneurs of Montreal, as King Louis XIV of France took personal control over the colony. The new system gave them the island of Montreal, with the obligation to live there and ensure its development by cultivating the land. In 1665, Louis XIV sent 1,200 men from the Régiment de Carignan-Salières. The Sulpicians organized \"seigneuries\" at the center of the island. François Dollier Casson established the first grid of streets in the colony, following the paths of existing trails. These early streets included the Rue Notre-Dame, the Rue Saint-Paul and Rue Saint-Jacques. Buildings of the era include the Hôtel-Dieu de Montréal, the Saint-Sulpice Old Seminary and Notre Dame Church (replaced later by the Notre-Dame Basilica).\n\nIn the early 18th century, the name \"Montreal\" (which originally referred to the mountain Mont-Royal) gradually replaced that of Ville-Marie. The arrival in 1657 of Marguerite Bourgeoys (who founded the Congregation Notre-Dame) and the arrival of the Jesuits and Recollets in 1692, helped to ensure the Catholic character of the settlement. The original fortifications of Montreal, erected in 1717 by Gaspard Chaussegros de Léry, formed the boundaries of Montreal at the time. De Léry had the fortifications constructed to secure the settlement from a British invasion and to allow future expansion inside the walls. Though the walls may have provided security from invasion, they created a different problem: a large concentration of wooden houses (with fireplaces) led to many devastating fires. In 1721, Montreal received a royal order from France to ban wood construction; buildings were to be constructed using stone, but the ban was never fully respected.\n\nCanada (New France) became a British colony in 1763 after the Seven Years' War. British rule radically changed the face of Old Montreal, partially due to significant fires that destroyed much of the city and provided the British with a mandate to rebuild it. In May 1765, fire destroyed about 110 houses before destroying the old Hôtel de Callière and the former General Hospital. In April 1768, 88 houses between rue Saint-Jean-Baptiste and Hotel Vaudreuil were burned, including the Congregation Notre-Dame convent. Between the two fires, nearly half of the buildings in the city were destroyed. In the following years, the city was rebuilt even more densely. On June 6, 1803, a massive fire destroyed the prison, the church and the dependencies of Jesuits, a dozen houses and the Château Vaudreuil. Two speculators bought the Château's gardens, offered one-third to the city, and divided the rest into seven lots of their own. The city's oldest public monument, Nelson's Column, was erected in 1809 on part of the former garden plot and given to the city. This space became the new market square, called \"Marché Neuf\" (New Market) before assuming its present name of Place Jacques-Cartier in 1845. The space occupied by the church of the Jesuits became the Place Vauquelin and Montreal City Hall arose from the old Jesuit gardens in 1873.\n\nIn 1812, a fire destroyed the luxurious Mansion House hotel, which had been popular with the Beaver Club and had housed the first public library in Montreal. It was replaced by the British-American Hotel, which contained the John Molson-built Royal Theatre, the city's first permanent theatre. The hotel burned in 1833, and was rebuilt in 1845 at the Bonsecours Market. In 1849, a riot caused a fire with political consequences when, protesting against a law, a Tory crowd burned down the Parliament building in the old Marché Saint-Anne on Place d'Youville. The site of the Parliament fire housed Montreal's first fire station in 1903; the building still exists as the Centre d’histoire de Montréal.\n\nColonial authorities decided upon the first radical transformation of the area in 1804, with the destruction of the fortifications surrounding the heart of Montreal. Completed in 1815, this enlarged the perimeter of Old Montreal and improved access to suburban communities. The 19th century witnessed the emergence of a bourgeoisie of mostly Scottish merchants. The growing activity of the port changed the urban landscape. Old Montreal became less residential, as the rich Scottish and English merchants built extravagant homes closer to Mont Royal (in what would become the Golden Square Mile). Anglophone influence became the dominating force in the areas of banking, manufacturing, commerce, and finance. St. James Street became the financial centre of Montreal, with large banks such as the Bank of Montreal and the Royal Bank of Canada, insurance companies and the stock exchange. \n\nMost of the financial buildings on St. James Street were designed by anglophone architects. The same is true for institutional buildings such as the Old Court House and the Customs House designed by John Ostell, the Bonsecours Market and even the Notre-Dame Basillica (whose façade is the work of an Irish Protestant from New York, James O'Donnell). The only notable exception is the Montreal City Hall, which was inspired by the Hotel de Ville de Rennes. The character of the Victorian style of the late-19th-century buildings was a significant change from the stone masonry used during the French era and affected the appearance of Old Montreal.\n\nThe district continued to grow during the early 20th century, evidenced by construction of prestigious buildings such as the Aldred Building (1929–1931), La Sauvegarde Building (1913), and the first Stock Exchange (1903–1904). Port activities, the financial sector, and the municipal government helped to maintain activity until the Great Depression began in 1929. During the Depression, the relocation of port facilities further east deprived Old Montreal of many companies related to the maritime trade, leaving many abandoned warehouses and commercial buildings. The downtown-area relocation several blocks to the north, and the near-complete absence of residents, (there were only a few hundred in 1950), had the effect of emptying the district when businesses closed at the end of the day. At that time, the lack of nightlife gave the district a reputation for being dangerous at night.\n\nOld Montreal increasingly found itself changing to accommodate the rise of the automobile. Several prestigious locations, such as the Place d'Armes, the Place d'Youville, and Place Jacques-Cartier, were snarled with traffic in the mid-20th century. For municipal authorities, unaware of its potential heritage value, Old Montreal was an anomaly. City planners considered wider streets, which would have meant razing many older buildings. A proposed elevated highway along the river over the rue de la Commune spurred a movement to preserve the district. Dutch-born architect and urban planner Daniel van Ginkel played a major role in saving the district from destruction during the early 1960s. As assistant director of the City of Montreal's newly formed planning department, he persuaded authorities to abandon plans for an expressway that would have cut through the old city. In 1964, most of Old Montreal was classified as a historic district; despite this, the Quebec government razed several 19th-century buildings to build a new courthouse.\nIn addition to the return of a residential base, the area has become attractive to the hotel industry. While in the 19th century all major hotels were in Old Montreal, by 1980 there were none. In 2009, there were about 20 hotels, mostly in restored older buildings. A steady stream of tourists and the presence of new residents encourage nightlife and entertainment. In addition, municipal authorities have invested large sums to renew the area's infrastructure. The Place Jacques-Cartier and part of the Place d'Youville have been redesigned, and a restoration of the Place d'Armes is in progress. A lighting plan was also developed to highlight the different façade styles. There is now a consensus that the historical legacy of Old Montreal is its major asset. Aided by redevelopment, it is now the leading tourist destination in Montreal.\n\nOld Montreal is a major tourist attraction. With some of its buildings dating to the 17th century, it is one of the oldest urban areas in North America. In the eastern part of the old city (near Place Jacques-Cartier) the following notable buildings can be found: Montreal City Hall, Bonsecours Market and Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Secours Chapel, as well as preserved colonial mansions, such as the Château Ramezay and the Sir George-Étienne Cartier National Historic Site of Canada. Further west, Place d'Armes is dominated by Notre-Dame Basilica] on its southern side, accompanied by the Saint-Sulpice Seminary (the oldest extant building in Montreal). The other sides of the square are devoted to commerce; to the north is the former Bank of Montreal Head Office and to the west, the Aldred Building and the 1888 New York Life Building, the oldest skyscraper in Canada. The rest of Saint Jacques Street is lined with old bank buildings (like the Old Royal Bank Building) from its heyday as Canada's financial centre.\n\nThe southwest of the old city contains important archeological remains of Montreal's first settlement (around Place d'Youville and Place Royale) in the Pointe-à-Callière museum. Architecture and cobbled streets in Old Montreal have been maintained or restored to keep the look of the city in its earliest days as a settlement, and horse-drawn calèches help maintain that image.\n\nThe old town's riverbank is taken up by the Old Port (Vieux-Port), whose maritime facilities are surrounded with recreational space and a variety of museums and attractions. The Iberville terminal on the Alexandra Pier serves as the cruise terminal for about 50,000 passengers annually from large cruise ships plying the St Lawrence Seaway.\n\nChamp de Mars is a large public space located between Montreal City Hall and the Ville-Marie Expressway. It offers a view of downtown Montreal and Chinatown. It is notable due to its location and its archaeological remains. The two parallel lines of stone are one of the few spots in present-day Montreal where you can still see physical evidence of the fortified settlement from colonial times.\n\nOld Montreal is accessible from downtown via the Underground City and is served by several STM bus routes and the Champ-de-Mars, Place-d'Armes, and Square-Victoria-OACI Metro stations. Ferries to the south shore city of Longueuil are available during the summer, as are a network of bicycle paths.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2095244", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2095244", "title": "Murabitun World Movement", "text": "Murabitun World Movement\n\nThe Murabitun World Movement is an Islamic movement founded by its current leader, Abdalqadir as-Sufi (born as Ian Dallas), with communities in several countries. Its heartland is Spain. The number of its followers may amount, according to one estimate, to around 10,000.\n\nThe movement's objectives include the restoration of Zakat, Da’wa and the practice of \"bayat\" (allegiance) to an amir. It considers itself a tariqa in the Darqawi-Shadhili-Qadiri Tariqa tradition.\n\nThe name Murabitun derives from the name of the Almoravid dynasty. The founder of the Murabitun World Movement is Abdalqadir as-Sufi, a convert to Islam born Ian Dallas in Ayr, Scotland, in 1930. He met his first Shaykh, Muhammad ibn al-Habib, in Meknes around 1968, and was made a \"muqaddam\" and given the title \"as-Sufi\". Ibn al-Habib said to him, “You can stay here with me, and something might happen. But go to England and see what will happen,” and so he went to London and gathered a group of new British Muslims, returning to Morocco in 1970. He founded a learning centre in Bristol Gardens, London, in 1972, and another centre in Berkeley, California.\n\nAbdalqadir as-Sufi travelled in Europe and America, held talks, and published works such as \"The Way of Muhammad\" and \"Islam Journal\" proposing that Islam could be understood, and entered, as the \"completion of the Western intellectual and spiritual tradition\". He also initiated translations into English of classical texts on Islamic law and Sufism, including the \"Muwatta Imam Malik\" and the letters of Muhammad al-Arabi al-Darqawi, published as \"The Darqawi Way\".\n\nIn 1982 Abdalqadir as-Sufi held a series of talks in America which were to become the basis of his work, \"Root Islamic Education\".\n\nThe political and social work of the Murabitun centres around the restoration of the “fallen pillar” of \"zakat\", which, it is claimed, has been abandoned on several primary counts.\n\nPrincipally:\n\nAs their authority for this position the Murabitun cite a wide range of sources, beginning with the Qur'anic injunction to take \"zakat\", the Prophetic practice of \"zakat\"-taking, the well-known position of the Khalif Abu Bakr as-Siddiq, and the established practice among the world Muslim community which was until relatively recently the assessment and collection of \"zakat\" by the Leader and his collectors.\n\nThis they place in contradistinction to the currently prevailing practices of voluntary self-assessment, donation to the \"zakat\" charity of one’s choice, and the placement of \"zakat\" donations into interim or even long-term investment funds. This, they argue, destroys the political cohesion of the Muslim community, which is based primarily on the circulation of wealth along divinely revealed lines. They also condemn \"zakat\" investment funds as un-Islamic.\n\nThey previously connected their position on \"zakat\" with promotion of the Islamic gold dinar and silver dirham, which was developed above all by the scholar Umar Ibrahim Vadillo. Paper money, since actually a promise of payment written on paper, can from the point of view of \"zakat\" only be considered in terms of its value as paper, since \"zakat\" cannot be discharged by passing on a token of debt owed to a third party. Vadillo has written extensively on the origins of paper money and the Islamic position on money.\n\nThe Murabitun traced the bi-metallic currency back to Muhammad and the first Muslim community; its specific weights and purities were formally recorded by ‘Umar Ibn al-Khattab. They also cited the dinar’s mention in the Qur'an, its use in the universally accepted \"fiqh\" to define the terms of \"zakat\", and its mention as currency throughout the entire body of Islamic \"fiqh\".\nIn February 2014, however, Shaykh Dr. Abdalqadir as-Sufi distanced himself from the dinar and dirham movement, saying, \"So, I now dis-associate myself from all activity involving the Islamic gold dinar and silver dirham\".\n\nThe Murabitun advocate personal rule as the Islamic and indeed natural form of human governance, taking authority for this position from extensive Qur'anic references. \n\nAbdalqadir as-Sufi's advocacy of Malik’s school of Madinah is explained at length in his work \"Root Islamic Education\". The Murabitun do not, however, in any way dispute the validity of the other legal schools, nor is adherence to or advocacy of the \"madhhab\" of Malik a condition of membership of the Murabitun.\n\nThe Murabitun advocate a revival of the forms of trading and social welfare practiced during the first generations of Muslims and for most of the history of Islam, proposing that these are the natural modes of human activity and rejecting the dialectical categorisation of “ancient” or “modern”, a set of opposites whose application to Islam they consider irrelevant and misleading.\n\nThese models have been formulated in detail and include \"awqaf\" for the funding of social welfare institutions, mosques and other public facilities.\n\nAbdalqadir as-Sufi has consistently identified terrorism and suicide tactics as forbidden in and alien to Islam, and indeed as a phenomenon with no precursor in Muslim history. Instead, he states that its original appearance as a tactic and a psychology was among the Isma‘ili sect of Shi‘a Islam, and that it later emerged among the Russian nihilists of the late 19th century.\n\nThe Murabitun organise themselves around amirs. This is distinct from the role of the movement’s founder, Abdalqadir as-Sufi, who, while exercising an undoubted influence, is a spiritual guide rather than a political leader – an arrangement common throughout the history of Islam.\n\n\n"}

It is located approximately from the mainland, west of Campeche. Their aggregate land area is . They belong to the municipality of Campeche in the state of Campeche.\n\nThe main island is Cayo del Centro, with an area of , which is scantily covered with grass. Bushes and several clumps of palms are also present. A pair of lighted range beacons stand on the cay. Cayo del Este, a cay large and high, lies on a detached reef lying southeast of Cayo del Centro. Cayo del Oeste, a cay in area and high, lies on a small detached reef about west of the south end of Cayo del Centro.\n\nThe chain is uninhabited, and lacks structures except for the beacons on Cayo del Centro. Vegetation on the islands is sparse, consisting of sand shrubs and grasses. It currently serves as a navigational marker. Cayos Arcas Terminal, an extensive chain of petroleum stations on the Arcas' reef system is located to the south of the islands. The Arcas oil rigs are currently among the largest oil producers in the gulf in terms of output.\n\nThe Arcas chain was often used for military operations in the Gulf during the 19th century. A naval flotilla from the Republic of Texas briefly occupied the island during action in the Republic of Yucatán rebellion. During the American Civil War the famous Confederate raider CSS Alabama used the remote chain as a rendezvous point to be resupplied while conducting operations in the gulf.\n\nCayo del Centro, the largest of the three islands, is in total, with about of permanently unsubmerged land. On the island, viewed through Google Maps, along with a covering of Palythoa caribaeorum, Zoanthus sociatus, Acropora palmata, Montastraea annularis, and Diploria strigosa, appear to be a few small buildings and small signs of past human habitation. The island has at least 6 sandy Tidal islands, none of which seem to exceed or have any vegetation on them.\n\nThe only other island with vegetation is Cayo del Este, which is to the east of Cayo del Centro. This island appears to have 2 species of plant on it, and a single nearby islet about long and wide. To the west, the island has a fairly long spit of sand leading to a sort of tidal lagoon.\n\nCayo del Oeste, the smallest the main islands, is further from the other two, and is mainly a triangular islet connected to a spit of sand, with a very small amount of vegetation at the center. The island, although having no nearby islets/sandbars, does have a shallow strip of coast going southwest from its eastern edge.\n\nAbout ⅓ of the way between Cayo del Centro and Cayo del Oeste is a shoal and small island long and only wide. The island, although small, has a fairly large surrounding shallows, which nearby boats should be wary of. Further to the north of this island is another shallow reef that, although not breaking the surface, is about wide and less than deep. Some of the group, most notably a cay on the North/Northeast part of the shoal, is surrounded by a very shallow, dangerous reef. The only safe entrances by boat to the islands are to the North-West-West, South-South-West, and West for the central, east, and west islands respectively. The islands are likely formed by coral growth around an extinct volcano caldera.\n"}

He went on to have a variety of jobs and travelled widely, from labouring on German railways to teaching English in Cairo and India. The choice of stage persona \"Hovis Presley\" was in itself a deft example of aspects of his work—ironic word-play, incongruously blending the expected norms of poetry with slightly surreal evocations of ordinary, and distinctively Northern English life.\n\nPresley began writing poems and sketches as a teenager but only ventured out onto the North West comedy circuit at the age of 29. His poem, \"I Rely On You\" (included in his 1993 anthology, \"Poetic Off Licence\"), was used by many couples in wedding ceremonies.\n\nPresley often performed his poems in a live environment, running an \"alternative to alternative comedy clubs\" and frequently appearing on radio with John Shuttleworth and Mark Radcliffe among others. He also appeared on the BBC Three show \"Whine Gums\", which presented many modern poets reading their work. His 1997 Edinburgh Festival Fringe show (entitled \"Wherever I Lay My Hat, That's My Hat\") was described as \"an hour of great material, lovingly performed\" and sold out. Presley, however, was terrified by this level of success and vanished. The shows were pulled and he was eventually found by police.\n\nAfter this he concentrated on smaller-scale events, outside the comedy mainstream, often working for charity. He also taught comedy to drama students at the University of Salford, having previously taught English as a second language and general studies. He regularly helped out his students by finding them slots at local comedy nights.\n\nHe died in June 2005 after a heart attack brought on by a viral infection. A tribute night was held in his home town of Bolton on 21 November 2005. The show was held in the Albert Halls, Bolton and was attended by Johnny Vegas, Badly Drawn Boy, Graham Fellows, Mark Radcliffe, Justin Moorhouse, Bernard Wrigley, Archie Kelly, Susan Vale, Phil Cool, Bob Williamson and Thick Richard.\n\n"}

She starred in 1982's \"Savannah Smiles\", for which she received her first of four Youth in Film Award nominations.\n\nAndersen was born on July 11, 1975, to Frank and Teresa Andersen. By April 1982, she lived in Malibu, California, with her parents, younger sister Angelica, and two brothers. As an infant, Angelica appeared in television advertisements for Bank of America and Mervyn's.\n\nA reader since age two-and-a-half, the \"Havre Daily News\" reported that six-year-old Andersen had \"a staggering IQ\". Her favorite author was Ernest Hemingway, and her favorite book was \"The Old Man and the Sea\". In February 1983, Andersen enjoyed the TV series \"Diff'rent Strokes\" and \"Silver Spoons\". The seven-and-a-half-year-old planned to continue acting, and aspired to produce and direct films as well.\n\nAndersen died of an opioid overdose in 1997, on Santa Monica Boulevard, at the age of 21.\n\nIn a February 1983 interview with Johnny Carson on his late-night show, Andersen related a family anecdote of her trying to climb into the television and play with \"Our Gang\" (\"The Little Rascals\") at age two. Caught by her father, she was taught about actors and acting, whereafter she secured a talent agent and began acting. She spent three years fashion modeling and acting in television advertisements. She also appeared in television shows including \"King's Crossing\" and \"Washington Mistress\".\n\nIn 1982, Andersen starred as Savannah Driscoll in the 1982 film \"Savannah Smiles\". Writer and co-star Mark Miller was inspired by—and wrote the part for—his daughter, Savannah Miller. However, when the film was ready to shoot, Ms. Miller was too old for the part at age eleven, so Mark Miller auditioned almost 150 children before discovering and choosing Andersen for the part. In a contemporary interview, Andersen opined that she and the Driscoll character were \"like twins! We do the same things.\" According to \"The Cumberland Times\", only three months after the release of \"Savannah Smiles\", Miller was already writing another script to star Andersen.\n\nThat same year, Andersen portrayed the six-year-old Mae West in the biographical television film, \"Mae West\". In 1983, Andersen explained that she preferred working in films versus television because they gave her more to do. During the 1983–84 run of \"The Mississippi\", Anderson was nominated for a Youth in Film Award (\"Best Young Actress - Guest in a Television Series\") for her work thereon. Andersen went on to star in the short-lived CBS sitcom, \"Gun Shy\"; she portrayed Celia, one of two children won in a card game by Barry Van Dyke's Russell Donovan.\n\nIn her teen years, Andersen had trouble finding acting work.\n\nIn 2015, actress Amber Tamblyn published her third book of poetry—\"Dark Sparkler\"—\"featuring elegies to late actresses both legendary and unknown, all who suffered untimely deaths.\" Andersen is the subject of one such poem, as is pornographic film actor Shannon Michelle Wilsey (1970–1994), whose stage name \"Savannah\" was derived from Andersen's \"Savannah Smiles\". Wilsey's poem is written as \"a meta-poem, where she's writing for Bridgette Andersen, and telling her how they're the same.\"\n\nWhen MVD Entertainment Group published \"Savannah Smiles\" on Blu-ray in 2018 as part of their MVD Rewind Collection, among the bonus materials included was \"a featurette about the memories of Andersen\".\n\n\n"}

His father was the Reverend Isaac O. Stringer, a prominent member of the Anglican Church of Canada. Originally from King's County, Ireland, the elder Stringer later became Archbishop of Yukon.\n\nStringer received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Toronto, and later a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Manitoba (1933).

Farbissina is a German attack and defence specialist and the founder of \"the militant wing of the Salvation Army\". She is also Dr. Evil's henchwoman and tries to help in his schemes to terrorize and take over the world. She has a heavy German accent and is well known for a running gag in which she shouts her orders needlessly loud and screeching, often startling Dr. Evil. For her performances, Sterling was nominated for Favorite Supporting Actress in a Comedy at the BMI Film & TV Awards.\n\nFrau's look and demeanour are parodies of several female villains from early James Bond films, namely \"From Russia with Love\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Rosa Klebb (played by Lotte Lenya), \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service's\" Irma Bunt (played by Ilse Steppat), and particularly the character of Frau Hoffner (played by Anna Quayle) in the 1967 Bond spoof \"Casino Royale\". In Mike Myers's book \"Canada\", he states that Frau was a mixture of Rosa Klebb and Lotta Hitschmanova, who appeared in commercials for the Unitarian Service Committee of Canada on late night \ntelevision. \n\nFarbissina asserts that she would eventually like to get out of the criminal mastermind business and open a boarding school for girls. This is another reference to Quayle's \"Frau Hoffner\" role in \"Casino Royale\" in which Hoffner heads an international spy school in East Berlin known as the \"Mata Hari School of Dancing\", where she boards and trains young women to be agents for both sides of the Cold War.\n\nHer surname derives from the Yiddish word ( in German), meaning \"embittered\"; a is an angry, bitter, vocal (male) person, while is the corresponding female form. \n\nShe has a heavy German accent; in the German dubbed versions of the films, she speaks with an Upper Saxon dialect, suggesting coming from East Germany. In Comedy Central's \"Canned Ham: The Doctor Evil Story\", a half-hour-long preview special of \"The Spy Who Shagged Me\", Dr. Evil states that he met Farbissina \"at gymnasia in Baden-Baden at a street corner next to the McDonald's.\"\n\nOut of all his henchmen and assistants, Farbissina is perhaps closest to Dr. Evil. In praising Dr. Evil, Farbissina commented, \"Dr. Evil is a man of great intelligence - able to step on a bug and say 'too bad!'\" \nFrau participates in helping Dr. Evil hijack a nuclear warhead and hold the world hostage. It is revealed that Frau used a sample of Evil's semen just a couple of years after Dr. Evil's cryostasis to artificially create his son, Scott Evil (played by Seth Green), now a Generation Y young adult. Scott is resentful of his father, but close to Frau, the only one who cares about his wellbeing. In the first film, Dr. Evil is about to press a button that would kill Scott for his insolence by burning him alive, but Frau swats his hand away, then winks at Scott.\nThe second film jumps from the 1990s to the 1960s due to time travel. Inexplicably, Frau Farbissina looks exactly the same in the 1960s as she did in the 1990s, which was used for comedic effect in the film.\n\nIn the present, she states that she is homosexual and is in a relationship with Una Brau, a woman she met on a LPGA tour. However, when Dr. Evil goes back in time, after imbibing some of Austin Powers' mojo, he has sex with Frau. This leads to an uncomfortable morning-after encounter and Farbissina swearing she will never love another man. In the closing credits, Farbissina and Scott Evil go on \"The Jerry Springer Show\", in which she reveals herself to be Scott's mother. She also reveals she never told him because she didn't want him to be hurt; he forgives her and they embrace.\n\nFrau is still helping Dr. Evil with his evil schemes. Frau and Dr. Evil also kiss while he is in prison; although the two enjoy it (despite her having been established as a lesbian in the previous movie), the purpose was to transfer a key to Dr. Evil so that he could escape. Once her son Scott begins to become evil, she shows that she is very proud.\n"}

He was officer-of-the-day for Sand Island Internment Camp in Hawaii on December 7, 1941, when the Imperial Japanese Navy attacked Pearl Harbor, during which Japanese aircraft made several strafing runs on the jeep he was driving. Shortly afterwards, Eifler was ordered to report to \"Wild Bill\" Donovan, commander of the Coordinator of Information, which would soon become the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). Eifler was selected to command Detachment 101, a paramilitary organization intended to operate against the Japanese army in the Burma Campaign, in China India Burma Theater. Eifler performed his work with distinction, surviving two plane crashes, but finally being disabled by head injuries that required 18 months of hospitalization.

The correct title of the song is \"African Herbsman\" but it was misspelled as \"African Herbman\" on the original LP label.\n\nCD releases (bonus tracks)\n\n\"Soul Revolution Part II\" is a \"dub\" companion set to \"Soul Revolution\", being the original \"Soul Revolution\" album with the vocals stripped off. In the case of \"Memphis\", which originally contained no vocals, Peter Tosh's lead melodica solo was removed to create the new instrumental version. This album was originally released only in Jamaica. The instrumental version of the album was originally released in a very limited pressing on Upsetter Records, \"part of which was jacketed in plain sleeves and part of which was jacketed in Soul Revolution Part II sleeves.\" Dating to as late as 2004, this album has also become known as \"Upsetter Revolution Rhythm,\" because of a CD by that name released in 2004 (HIP-O RECORDS / Universal Music / JAD B0003300-02) which was a reissue of the original instrumental album, with the addition of one bonus track: \"Kaya version alternate mix\".\n\nIn 1988, Trojan Records released a double-LP reissue of both albums, catalogue number TRLD 406, called \"Soul Revolution I & II\". This release included four extra tracks as compared with the original two LPs, which were \"Soul Rebel\" and \"Mr. Brown\" along with the instrumental 'dub' versions, \"Soul Rebel version 4\" and \"Dracula\". Curiously, and partially in line with \"Duppy Conqueror V/4\" from the original vocal LP, \"Soul Rebel version 4\" contains only a small portion of choral vocals at the beginning of the song, with the rest being instrumental. On the first disc of this release, \"Duppy Conqueror V/4\" is mistitled as \"Duppy Conqueror.\" On the second disc, which is identified as \"The Rhythm Album,\" song 5 is mistitled as \"Duppy Conqueror Version 4\" when in this context it should be titled just \"Duppy Conqueror\". On disc 1, the misspelled title of \"African Herbman\" is preserved as on the original vocal LP, while on disc 2, the spelling of the title of the instrumental version has been corrected to \"African Herbsman\". The cover of this Trojan Records release had a two-tone close-up photo-based image of Bob Marley in a square in the middle, surrounded on all four sides by repeated images of Bunny Wailer and Peter Tosh and another image of Bob Marley, as well as multi-colored text reading \"BOB MARLEY AND THE WAILERS SOUL REVOLUTION 1 AND 2\". This cover of this Trojan reissue should not be confused with the cover of the original vocal Soul Revolution LP, which had a turquoise background, with dark blue text, and featured an octagonal-shaped picture in the middle, surrounded by six square-shaped photos.\n\nBonus tracks\n\n\n\n\n"}

Holmes — was an American explorer, anthropologist, archaeologist, artist, scientific illustrator, cartographer, mountain climber, geologist and museum curator and director.\n\nWilliam Henry Holmes was born on a farm near Cadiz, in Harrison County, Ohio, to Joseph and Mary Heberling Holmes on December 1, 1846. One of his forebears was the Rev. Obadiah Holmes, who emigrated to Salem, Massachusetts in 1638. William Henry Holmes graduated from the McNeely Normal School, Hopedale, Ohio in 1870 and afterwards briefly taught drawing, painting, natural history, and geology at the school. In 1889 the school awarded him an honorary A.B. (Bachelor of Arts) degree. Later, in 1918, Holmes received an honorary Doctor of Science degree from The George Washington University, Washington, D.C. for his work and achievements.\n\nIn 1871, he went to Washington, D.C., to study art under Theodore Kaufmann. His talent soon came to the attention of the scientists at the Smithsonian Institution, notably Fielding Bradford Meek, and Holmes was employed drawing and sketching fossil shells and shells of live mollusks. In 1872, Holmes became an artist/topographer with the government survey of Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden, replacing Thomas Moran. His first trip out West was to the newly established Yellowstone National Park. During the 1870s, Holmes gained a national reputation as a scientific illustrator, cartographer, pioneering archaeologist, and geologist. His work on the laccolith influenced Grove Karl Gilbert's own work on the same. In the field, Holmes worked closely with the photographer William H. Jackson and back in Washington he helped produce Hayden's great achievement, the \"Geological and Geographical Atlas of Colorado, And Portions of Adjacent Territory\" (1877, 1881).\n\nAfter the Hayden Survey was absorbed into the U.S. Geological Survey in 1879, Holmes went to Munich, Germany, to further his art studies under Frank Duveneck and to take lessons in \"museum making\" from Adolphe B. Meyer of Dresden's Anthropology Museum. On Holmes's return to the U.S., he was hired by the Geological Survey and assigned to Clarence Dutton as a geologist and illustrator. Holmes illustrated the atlas for Dutton's \"Tertiary History of the Grand Canyon District\" (1882); his triptych panorama of the Grand Canyon from Point Sublime is a masterpiece of American scientific illustration. He was also a noted mountain climber, and a peak in Yellowstone National Park — Mount Holmes — was named in his honor. In 1875, Holmes began studying the remains of the Ancestral Pueblo culture in the San Juan River region of Utah. His models of ancient Indian ruins were a sensation at the Centennial International Exhibition in Philadelphia. Holmes became particularly interested in prehistoric pottery and shell art, producing the published works of \"\"Art in Shell of the American Indians\" (1883)\" and \"\"Pottery of the Ancient Pueblos (1886)\"\". He expanded these studies to include textiles, and he became well known as an expert in both ancient and existing arts produced by Native Americans of the Southwest. In 1889 he discovered and reported Indian petroglyphs in central West Virginia.\n\nHolmes left the Geological Survey in 1889 to become an archaeologist with the Smithsonian Institution's Bureau of American Ethnology. He left Washington temporarily, from 1894 to 1897, to serve as curator of anthropology at the Field Columbian Museum in Chicago, during which time he led an expedition to Mexico. He returned to the Smithsonian in 1897 to serve as head curator of anthropology at the U.S. National Museum. From 1902 to 1909 he served as Chief (i.e. director) of the Bureau of American Ethnology, succeeding John Wesley Powell. During this period he studied the Etowah Indian Mounds of the Mississippian culture in Georgia, and in 1903, he published his \"Synthesis of Pottery\". In 1905, Holmes was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society. In 1910, he became chairman of the Division of Anthropology of the U.S. National Museum. In 1920, Holmes became the director of National Gallery of Art (now the Smithsonian American Art Museum), where he assembled exhibits of Indian arts from the Northwest Coast. He published many works on archæological and anthropological subjects. He edited geological publications, including Hayden's \"Atlas of Colorado\" and the eleventh and twelfth reports of the Geological Survey. His books include: \"Handbook of Aboriginal American Antiquities\" (1919).\n\nHolmes lived with his son in Royal Oak, Michigan, upon his retirement in 1932 from the position of Director of the National Gallery of Art. He died April 20, 1933.\n\nIn the year of his death, a memorial exhibition of ninety-two of Holmes' artworks was held at the Corcoran Gallery of Art. As a teacher, his pupils included Susan Brown Chase.\n\nOf Holmes's many contributions and accomplishments, he is probably best known for the role he played in the controversy over the antiquity of humans in the Americas. Holmes insisted that claims for the early presence of humans should be subjected to the most rigorous testing. His position on this matter had a healthy and conservative influence on what is one of the most fundamental questions in American archaeology.\n\nPublished and unpublished writings by Holmes include:\n\n\n"}

It is the second multiplayer-focused game in the \"Quake\" series after \"Quake III Arena\".\n\n\"Quake Wars\" features similar gameplay to \"\", but with the addition of controllable vehicles and aircraft as well as multiple AI deployables, asymmetric teams, much bigger maps and the option of computer-controlled bot opponents. Unlike the previous \"Enemy Territory\" games, \"Quake Wars\" is a commercial release rather than a free download.\n\n\"Enemy Territory: Quake Wars\" received mostly positive reviews upon release, although it received some criticism on consoles.\n\nSince 2011, the rights to the game have reverted to ZeniMax Media.\n\nAs of January 10, 2020 Quake Wars online is no longer available for play.\n\n\"Quake Wars\" is a class-based, objective focused, team-oriented game. Teams are based on human (GDF) and alien (Strogg) technology. While the teams are asymmetrical, both sides have the same basic weapons and tools to complete objectives. Unlike other team-based online games (such as the \"Battlefield\" series), the gameplay is much more focused on one or two main objectives at once, rather than spread all over the combat area. This allows for much more focused and intense combat situations, similar to the original \"Unreal Tournament\" assault mode.\n\nEach player class normally has new objectives show up during game play, many times based around the specific capabilities of that class. The game also has the capability to group players into fireteams for greater coordinated strategy. These fireteams can be user created or game generated depending on the mission selected by the player.\n\nThe game has an experience points (XP) rewards system in place, which rewards every player some points depending on the mission completed. This accumulated XP later leads to unlocks which may vary from availability of new equipment/weapons to abilities like faster movement or more accurate weapons. These rewards are reset to zero after the completion of every campaign, which consists of three unique maps, all with a common locale/region.\n\n\"Enemy Territory: Quake Wars\" was first announced through a press release on May 16, 2005. The public beta opened to FilePlanet paid subscribers on June 20, 2007 and to nonpaying members on June 23, 2007. There were also beta keys given out for a limited time exclusively at QuakeCon 2007. The public beta ended on September 25, 2007. A second build of the beta was released on August 3, 2007. It features a new map entitled Valley to replace Sewer and several changes to the game code to improve performance and implement new features. This map was featured in tutorial videos released prior to the beta, and was the map made available to play at QuakeCon 2006. The Valley map is based on a real Earth location: Yosemite Valley.\n\nA PC demo for Windows was released on September 10, 2007 and for Linux on October 16, 2007 also featuring the map Valley. The full Linux version was released on October 19, 2007. A Mac OS X client has also been released. In January 2008, a new updated version (2.0) of the demo was released. The updated demo includes changes introduced in the 1.4 patch such as 'tutorial mode'. The original 1.0 demo is no longer supported and should not be downloaded. The final retail version was first released on September 28, 2007 for Windows. The initial Linux release, created by id Software employee Timothee Besset, was made available three weeks later on October 19, 2007. As of 2019, \"Quake Wars\" is the most recent id Software game to have received a Linux release.\n\n\"Quake Wars\" utilized a modified version of the id Tech 4 engine with the addition of a technology called MegaTexture, a new texture mapping technique developed by John D. Carmack of id Software. The technology allows maps to be totally unique, without any repeated terrain tiles. Battlefields can be rendered to the horizon without any fogging, with over a square mile of terrain at inch-level detail, while also providing terrain-type detail that defines such factors as bullet hit effects, vehicle traction, sound effects, and so on. Each megatexture is derived from a 32768×32768 pixel image, which takes up around 3 gigabytes in its raw form (with 3 bytes per pixel, one byte for each color channel).\n\nA collector's edition of the game was released exclusively for Microsoft Windows on October 2, 2007 in North America and September 9, 2007 in Australia and Europe (in Europe the collector's edition was released as Premium Edition). The collector's edition features the game itself, 10 collectible cards (there are 12 cards, but the first two are only available via preorder) and a bonus disc, which contains concept art, HD videos, interviews, artwork, downloadable icons, ringtones and music tracks.\n\nOn the review aggregator GameRankings, the PC version of the game had an average score of 84% based on 55 reviews. On Metacritic, the game had a score of 84 out of 100 based on 52 reviews. Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot gave the game a rating of 8.5/10. Other reviews are generally very positive, scoring \"Quake Wars\" in the 8–9 (out of 10) range. For the week ending September 29, 2007, \"Quake Wars\" was the best selling PC title in the United Kingdom according to the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association. On October 17, 2007, after its top of the charts sale in the United Kingdom, \"Quake Wars\" debuted at a familiar #1 spot yet again in the United States. According to NPD group's top 10 best selling PC game charts, it managed to take the #1 spot. Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 reviews for the game were generally much less positive, with IGN giving the 360 version 6.1 and the PlayStation 3 version 5.3, citing game issues and inferior graphics to the PC version as causes for the lower score.\n"}

When he was born, three Norns arrived and foretold the child's destiny. Two of them gave him good gifts. However Skuld, the youngest of the Norns, deeming that the two others made rather light of her, determined to render void their promises of good fortune for the child. So she prophesied that his life was to last no longer than that of a candle standing lit beside the cradle. The eldest Norn (Urðr) instantly extinguished the flame and asked his mother to hide it well.\n\nWhen Norna-Gest had grown up he became the care-taker of the candle and he is said to have lived for 300 years. He took part in the battles of Sigurd the Völsung, spent time with Ragnar Lodbrok's son Björn Ironside and his brothers, with Starkad, with the Swedish king Sigurd Hring, with King Erik at Uppsala, with King Harald Fairhair and with King Hlodver in Germany.\n\nAccording to legend, when King Olaf Tryggvason tried to convert the Norse to Christianity, he brought Norna-Gest to his court. In the third year of the reign of King Olaf, Norna-Gest came into the presence of the king and asked to be admitted to his bodyguard. He was uncommonly tall and strong and somewhat stricken in years. Norna-Gest afterward permitted himself to be baptized at the king's desire and lit the candle that the norn Skuld had prophesied about. In accordance with the prophecy, when the candle failed, Norna-Gest died.\n\nThe story of Norna-Gest is narrated in \"Nornagests þáttr\", which was written about the year 1300. The story was later incorporated as an episode of the \"Saga of Óláfr Tryggvason\" in the medieval Icelandic manuscript Flateyjarbók which contains several poems from the Poetic Edda. \n\nThe story of Nornagest and his candle has a counterpart in Greek mythology: the story of Meleager, who was prophesied to live only as long as a certain log was unburnt. The story is included in Ovid's Metamorphoses.\n\nScience fiction writer Poul Anderson incorporated the story of Nornagest in \"The Boat of a Million Years\", a collection of short stories about immortals.\n\n"}

{"id": "2095387", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2095387", "title": "Hans Keller", "text": "Hans Keller\n\nHans (Heinrich) Keller (11 March 19196 November 1985) was an Austrian-born British musician and writer, who made significant contributions to musicology and music criticism, as well as being a commentator on such disparate fields as psychoanalysis and football. In the late 1950s, he invented the method of \"wordless functional analysis\", in which a musical composition is analysed in musical sound alone, without any words being heard or read. He worked full-time for the BBC between 1959 and 1979.\n\nKeller was born into a wealthy and culturally well-connected Jewish family in Vienna, and, as a boy, was taught by the same Oskar Adler who had, decades earlier, been Arnold Schoenberg's boyhood friend and first teacher. He also came to know the composer and performer Franz Schmidt, but was never a formal pupil. In 1938, the Anschluss forced Keller to flee to London (where he had relatives), and, in the years that followed, he became a prominent and influential figure in the UK's musical and music-critical life. Initially active as a violinist and violist, he soon found his niche as a highly prolific and provocative writer on music, as well as an influential teacher, lecturer, broadcaster and coach.\n\nAn original thinker never afraid of controversy, Keller's passionate support of composers whose work he saw as under-valued or insufficiently understood made him a tireless advocate of Benjamin Britten and Arnold Schoenberg, as well as an illuminating analyst of figures such as Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven and Mendelssohn. Many of Keller's earliest articles appeared in the journals \"Music Review\" and \"Music Survey\", the latter of which was co-edited by him after he joined the founding editor Donald Mitchell for the so-called 'New Series' (1949–52). In later years, much of his advocacy was carried out from within the BBC, where he came to hold several senior positions and was a regular contributor to \"The Listener\" magazine.\n\nIt was also from within the BBC that Keller (in collaboration with Susan Bradshaw) perpetrated in 1961 the \"Piotr Zak\" hoax, broadcasting a deliberately nonsensical series of random noises, as a new modernist piece by a fictitious Polish composer. The hoax was designed to demonstrate the poor quality of critical discourse surrounding contemporary music at a problematic stage in its historical development; in this aspect, the hoax was a failure, as no critic expressed any particular enthusiasm for Piotr Zak's piece, with all published reviews being roundly dismissive of the work.\n\nIn 1967, Keller had an famous encounter with the rock group Pink Floyd (then called \"The Pink Floyd\") on the TV show \"The Look of the Week\". Keller was generally puzzled by, or even contemptuous of, the group and its music, repeatedly returning to the criticism that they were too loud for his taste. He ended his interview segment with the band by saying: \"My verdict is that it is a little bit of a regression to childhood – but, after all, why not?\"\n\nKeller's gift for systematic thinking, allied to his philosophical and psycho-analytic knowledge, bore fruit in the method of \"wordless functional analysis\" (abbreviated by the football-loving Keller as \"FA\"), designed to furnish incontrovertibly audible demonstrations of a masterwork's \"all-embracing background unity\". This method was developed in tandem with a \"Theory of Music\" that explicitly considered musical structure from the point of view of \"listener expectations\"; the \"meaningful contradiction\" of expected \"background\" by unexpectable \"foreground\" was seen as generating a work's expressive content. An element of Keller's theory of unity was the \"Principle of Reversed and Postponed Antecedents and Consequents\", which has not been widely adopted. His term \"homotonality\", however, has proved useful to musicologists in several fields.\n\nKeller was married to the artist Milein Cosman, whose drawings illustrated some of his work.\n\nAs a man prominent in the world of 'contemporary music' (even working for several years as the BBC's \"Chief Assistant, New Music\"), Keller had close personal and professional ties with many composers and was frequently the dedicatee of new compositions. Those who dedicated works to him include:\n\nIn December 1979, Keller received the \"Special Award\" of the Composers' Guild of Great Britain. In September 1985, just weeks before his death from motor neurone disease, he received from the President of Austria the \"Ehrenkreuz für Wissenschaft und Kunst, 1 Klasse\" (\"Cross of Honour for Arts and Sciences, 1st Class\"). His manuscripts (radio broadcasts and musicological writings) are kept at the Cambridge University Library.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2095398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2095398", "title": "Tamaran", "text": "Tamaran\n\nTamaran is a fictional planet in DC Comics, inhabited by Tamaraneans, an extraterrestrial race. The first Tamaranean introduced was Princess Koriand'r, better known as Starfire. Other named Tamaraneans are Komand'r, Starfire's sister (also known as Blackfire), her younger brother Ryand'r and her parents, Myand'r and Luand'r. (In the \"Teen Titans\" animated series, Galfore, Starfire's \"k'norfka\", the equivalent of a nanny, appears as well, though her parents do not.) The planet was destroyed in a war, along with Starfire's parents and many of its people. However, enough evacuated that they were able to settle on a new planet they named New Tamaran, though that planet was also destroyed. The most recent Tamaranean home was the planet Karna.\n\nBefore its destruction, Tamaran had not one ruling family, but rather many ruling families. When the planet was led to war by the Citadel race, Starfire's parents became the planet's sole ruling family. However, Blackfire later seized control from her parents. Blackfire has since been the ruler of the Tamaranean people, even after the repeated destruction of their home world.\n\nTamaraneans are gold-skinned humanoid people with green eyes and bushy hair who descended from a feline-like race. Tamaraneans traditionally worship the goddess X'Hal. Tamaraneans have the power to convert ultraviolet radiation into energy for flight with the females producing a distinctive contrail that seems to flow from their hair. They are ruled by their emotions and were renowned as excellent warriors. Both Starfire and Blackfire gained the ability to fire \"starbolts\", beams of energy, as a result of experiments performed by the Psions.\n\nThe Tamaraneans used scientific skills to make Tamaran a tropical paradise where man and nature stood side by side. The Tamaraneans fought a war with the Citadel for a century until Komand'r revealed secrets which resulted in major losses of Tamaranean life. After this, King Myand'r agreed to have his younger daughter, Princess Koriand'r given up for slavery to the Citadel. The Citadel was defeated by the Omega Men and Tamaran was plunged into civil war. This was ultimately resolved with Komand'r being given command of the planet.\n\nIn the Relaunch, it is unknown how much of the universe has changed, but there have been significant changes in the history and culture of the Tamaranean people. Komand'r is said to have sold her sister for the safety of Tamaran from the Citadel. A major change is that Tamaraneans shown are said to only view other races as sensory experiences, to the point they forget what they look like if not around the person. Though it's shown that once identified by name, Starfire can remember them. This however is possibly false as Starfire later expresses trying to avoid getting her heart broken and was scared to become close with another human. It's also said they do not believe emotions are a necessary part of the sexual experience, recreational or reproduction wise. \n\nTamaran suddenly came under attack by the Blight, a parasitic alien race, causing the Tamaranean starship \"Starfire\" to seek out its commander, the Princess Koriand'r, also known as Starfire. Koriand'r is hesitant to save the planet due to the people and her sister allowing her to be enslaved. It's revealed that Komand'r is working alongside the blight, but to what end is unknown.\n\nThe Tamaranean People have visited the planet earth on multiple occasions as explained by Crux, as he lost his parents to a War Cruiser crashing into their car. Starfire's earth home is shown to be a huge crashed ship on a tropical island near the United States.\n\nPossibly an alternate version of Tamaran is shown in Green Lantern New Guardians. The people still are orange skinned, and have the same abilities .They also have a number of small horns on their faces and shoulders. They present themselves as overtly friendly, believing that Arkillo and Saint Walker as heralds of The \"Archangel\" Invictus.\n\n\n"}

Although the match with defending champion Viswanathan Anand finished level at 6–6, Gelfand lost the deciding rapid tie break 2½–1½.\n\nGelfand has won major tournaments at Wijk aan Zee, Tilburg, Moscow, Linares and Dos Hermanas. He has competed in eleven Chess Olympiads and held a place within the top 30 players ranked by FIDE from January 1990 to October 2017.\n\nBoris Gelfand was born in Minsk, Belarussian SSR, on 24 June 1968 to Belarussian Jews parents. His parents, Abram and Nella, were engineers. His father bought him a book about chess, \"Journey to the Chess Kingdom\", by Averbakh and Beilin, when he was five years old.\n\nRecognised as a talent, Gelfand's first coach from 1974 to 1979 was Eduard Zelkind. Soon after he studied under Tamara Golovey for two years and IM Albert Kapengut for twelve. In 1980–83, he attended the Tigran Petrosian School. Early successes included winning the Sokolsky Memorial in 1983 and consecutive Belarusian Chess Championships in 1984-5. In 1985 he won the USSR Junior Championship scoring 9/11 and came second to Yury Balashov in the 1986 Minsk International.\n\nIn the July 1987 FIDE rating list, Gelfand made his first appearance in the top 100 players, ranked number 80. He became European Junior Champion in 1987, shared second at the USSR Young Masters held in Uzhgorod and shared sixth place at a USSR Championship qualifier event in Sverdlovsk in 1987 with 10/17. Gelfand's successes saw him ranked in the world's top 40 players. After sharing first place in the USSR Young Masters tournament of 1988 in Vilnius and the OHRA B Group in Amsterdam, he came second in the World Junior Championship to Joël Lautier on tiebreaks and shared first with Sergey Dolmatov at the Klaipeda USSR Championship qualifier.

Soon after, he won the Palma de Mallorca Open with 7½/9.\n\nHe received invitations to major tournaments in 1990, placing second behind Garry Kasparov with 7½/11 in Linares and Dortmund, sharing first with Vassily Ivanchuk in the Manila Interzonal and third at Tilburg. At the Candidates Matches in early 1991, Gelfand defeated Predrag Nikolic 5½-4½ but was beaten in the next round by Nigel Short 3-5. Despite the disappointment, Gelfand claimed first place at Belgrade with 7½/11 and shared second place with Kasparov at Reggio Emilia, half a point behind Viswanathan Anand. He shared first place with Valery Salov at Wijk aan Zee in 1992, shared second place at Munich, lost in the final of Tilburg knockout to Michael Adams and shared first with Anand at the Alekhine Memorial held in Moscow.\n\nA solid second place at Munich in 1993 preceded his biggest tournament win to this point, winning the Biel Interzonal with a score of 9/13, earning a spot in the 1994 Candidates Matches.

In the quarterfinals, he won a complex struggle on the black side of the Najdorf Defense in game three to defeat Shakhriyar Mamedyarov 2½–1½ and advance to the semifinals, where he faced American Gata Kamsky. After splitting the first four games 2–2, Kamsky won game three in the rapid playoff to go ahead 2–1, forcing Gelfand to win with black in the final rapid game in order to avoid elimination. Gelfand was up to the task, and then won the blitz playoff 2–0 to advance to the final. In the final, he faced Alexander Grischuk. After drawing the first five games, Gelfand won the sixth and final game on the white side of a Grünfeld Defence to win the match and the tournament 3½–2½.\n\nAs winner of the Candidates Tournament, Gelfand faced Anand for the 2012 World Championship.

He is married to Maya. He is a football fan and a member of FC Barcelona.\n\nGelfand is noted for his strong positional awareness and precise strategic play. In Gelfand's autobiography \"My Most Memorable Games\", Kramnik wrote in the preface, \"He is not only - and this is accessible only to a few - a highly universal player, capable of playing equally well in the most varied types of positions...This inexorable consistency in the realisation of his strategic conceptions is, in my view, the main trait of Boris Gelfand the chess player.\" Jacob Aagaard commented \"But Gelfand is not a natural attacker; instead he is a deep strategic player who likes to get into the logic of a position - and to keep control\".\n\nGelfand is noted for opening as White with 1.d4 and as a specialist in the Najdorf Sicilian, Petroff Defence, Slav Defense, and King's Indian Defence as Black. During the World Championship Match in 2012, the Anand team noted his abrupt change from the expected Sicilian Najdorf and Petroff openings to the Sicilian Sveshnikov and the Grunfeld.\n\nAt the Tigran Petrosian school, he met the former world champion in person and received advice: 'I remember Tigran Petrosian saying to me: \"Never make a move without there being an idea behind it, even when playing blitz. Always think!\"'.\n\n\n"}

They supported the election of Charlot Salwai as Prime Minister.\n\nThe party was founded on 17 August 1971 by Walter Lini as the New Hebridean Cultural Association, renamed later that same year as the New Hebrides National Party, and was one of two parties formed during the country's move towards independence. While the NHNP was supported by British interests, the Union of New Hebrides Communities was supported by French interests. The NHNP went on to win the 1975 elections and in 1977 it was renamed the Vanua'aku Pati. The party won the pre-independence 1979 elections and Lini became chief minister. The country gained independence in 1980 and Lini became the first Prime Minister of Vanuatu, remaining in the post until 1991. In 1991 the party split, and Lini was among those who left the party.\n\nAfter the 1991 elections, the party lost its dominance over the government. Despite this, the party remained strong. During the next decade, as party members Donald Kalpokas and Edward Natapei served as prime ministers of Vanuatu. The party began steadily losing seats in the early 2000s; it took 18 in the 1998 elections, 14 in the 2002 elections, and 8 in the 2004 elections, a setback which forced Prime Minister Natapei to resign. The party suffered another split after the elections, as the leadership refused to support the national coalition government of Serge Vohor while two Vanua'aku Party representatives supported this government, allowing it to take office. However, after a controversy over the diplomatic recognition of Taiwan and China, the Vanua'aku Party reunited in December 2004 and was involved in the effort to oust Vohor. It remained influential, and was a key supporter of the National United Party government of Walter Lini's brother Ham Lini which lasted from December 2004 through the September 2008 elections. After a short break from participation in the coalition government, the party returned in July 2007 when its leader, former Prime Minister Edward Natapei, became deputy prime minister. The party had a strong result in the September 2008 elections, gaining 11 of the 52 results, making this party the largest one in Parliament and allowing Natapei to return as prime minister.\n\nAfter multiple attempts to remove Natapei, he was forced out by a vote of no confidence on 2 December 2010, replaced by opposition leader Sato Kilman. Natapei was temporarily reinstated on 16 June 2011 when the Supreme Court of Vanuatu ruled Kilman's election as prime minister violated the Vanuatu constitution. A new election was held on 26 June of that year, in which Kilman was reinstated.\n\nThe party lost three seats in the parliamentary elections of 30 October 2012; however, it remained the largest single party in parliament.\n\nThe name of the Vanua'aku Party means \"Party of Our land\" in English (from the word \"vanua\"). It supports socialist economic policies and is mostly supported by English speakers.\n"}

It was founded by Vanuatu's independence leader Walter Lini when he broke away from the Vanua'aku Pati, alongside businessman Đinh Văn Thân. It is a social democratic party which traditionally received most of its support from English speakers.\n\nIn 1991, Walter Lini, who had served as prime minister of Vanuatu for 12 years as a member of the Vanua'aku Pati and lost his position after a split in the party, founded the National United Party, soon becoming its leader. Following Walter's death in 1999, his brother Ham Lini became party leader. The party became one of the largest political parties in Vanuatu along with the Vanua'aku Party and the Union of Moderate Parties, and participated in coalitions with both at various times. In the July 2004 elections, the party won 10 of the 52 seats, and because of losses by the other major parties, it became the largest single party in Parliament. In December 2004, Ham Lini became prime minister, the first member of NUP to take this position while a member of the party. At the 2008 elections, the NUP lost 2 seats, and received a total of 8 seats in Parliament, becoming the second largest party. Ham Lini was not able to form another government, but the National United Party became an important coalition partner in the new government formed by the Vanua'aku Party.\n\nAfter the 2012 elections NUP remained in coalition with the People's Progress Party in the Kilman government. The party went into opposition upon the election of Moana Carcasses as Prime Minister in 2013. It returned to government in 2014 when a motion of no confidence brought the government of Joe Natuman to power, with Ham Lini as Deputy Prime Minister, then returned to opposition in 2015 during the Sato Kilman government.\n\nAlthough untarnished by the bribery scandal that brought down Kilman's government, NUP won only 4 seats in the subsequent general election, 3 of them on Pentecost Island. As of 2016, the party is once again in government, as part of a broad coalition, and Ham Lini is Minister for Climate Change.\n\n"}

It tells the story of untouchability through folklore and Bhavai.\n\n\"Bhavni Bhavai\" was Ketan Mehta's debut film and received a critical acclaim. Mehta won the prestigious Nargis Dutt Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration, while Meera Lakhia won National Film Award for Best Production Design at the 28th National Film Awards. The film was selected for a festival at the Museum of Modern Art and received UNESCO Club Human Rights award at the Three Continents Festival.\n\nThe story begins with a group of Harijans migrating to a city and pausing for a night. An elderly (Om Puri) starts narrating the story of King Chakrasen.\n\nKing Chakrasen (Naseeruddin Shah) badly wants an heir, but neither of his two queens conceives a child.\n\nOne day Chakrasen smells a foul odor at his darbar. Upon investigating he is told the place is not cleaned because bhangis are on holiday for a wedding. Angrily, he summons them immediately and orders their flagellation as punishment. Meanwhile, his spy brings the information that his people are conspiring against the king. On the advice of his prime minister (Benjamin Gilani), he decides to declare a war against the neighbouring state, as a distraction. Unknown to the king, his prime minister is having an affair with his younger queen (Suhasini Mulay). Before the king can declare a war, the neighbouring king decides to attack for the similar reasons. Chakrasen's army wins the war but suffers major brutality. At the same time, the king receives the news that his elder queen is expecting a child. Hearing this news, the jealous young queen and prime minister conspires with the royal astrologer and tells the king that if the king sees the face of the newborn, he will die immediately. Fearing for his life, the king orders killing of the newborn. The soldiers, ordered to kill the child, have a change of heart. They put him in a wooden box and let go of him in the river. One of the bhangis, Malo Bhagat (Om Puri), finds the box and decides to raise 'Jeevo' with his wife, Dhuli (Dina Pathak), as his own. While in the kingdom, the royal astrologer suggests that if the king wants a child, he must build a stepwell and the king agrees to it.\n\nYears pass by, the work on stepwell continues, but they can't find the water. Jeevo (Mohan Gokhale) grows up and falls in love with gypsy girl, Ujam (Smita Patil). The royal astrologer accidentally discovers that Jeevo is the son of the king and tells the king that the king must sacrifice 'Batress Lakshano Purush' (a man with 32 qualities), if he wants water in the stepwell and Jeevo is the only eligible man besides the king himself. The army sets out to capture Jeevo, but he runs away. Ranglo (jester) (Nimesh Desai) learns the truth and decides to inform the elder queen. Before that, the prime minister captures him and puts him in jail. Jeevo makes a plan with Ujam and tells the king that if he agrees to end the untouchability of his caste, then he'll surrender — else he'll kill himself and the king won't be able to complete the sacrifice. After consulting his ministers, Chakrasen reluctantly agrees to the demand. On the day of the sacrifice, Ranglo escapes from the prison and tells the king that Jeevo is his own son, to which king is delightful and aborts the execution. The stepwell suddenly starts filling up with water.\n\nAs the story approaches the end, one of the Harijans stops the elder and tells him not to lure the children with false 'happy endings' and narrates his own alternate ending. In the alternate ending, Ranglo doesn't arrive to tell the truth and sacrifice proceeds as planned, but there is still no water in the stepwell. Unable to bear the shock of their son's death, Jeevo's mother dies and Malo curses the king and commits suicide in the stepwell. Upon Malo's death, stepwell gets over-flooded, killing king and his ministers with him. The final sequence is interspersed with the footage of violent protests of Indian independence movement.\n\nAfter graduating from the Film and Television Institute of India, Ketan Mehta was working for a satellite channel. Through his travels in villages, he came across the problems faced by rural population, specifically untouchability. He also came across Dhiruben Patel's play \"Bhavni Bhavai\", — which back then was performed as a \"Bhavai\" — and decided to turn it into a movie. He was also inspired by \"Achhutno Vesh\", a Bhavai performance. For production, the people associated with had formed a cooperative, the Sanchal Film Cooperative Society. The film was made on a meager budget of , with funding from NFDC. Most of the actors, including Naseeruddin Shah, Om Puri and Smita Patil agreed to work without any compensation\n\nNaseeruddin Shah initially declined the role, because of his previous experience of working with Ketan Mehta, when the latter directed Eugène Ionesco's play \"The Lesson\" for him. Ketan Mehta persisted and Naseeruddin finally agreed to do it because of his liking for the film, though he was hesitant about playing the role of a \"Bumbling Raja\".\n\nKetan Mehta filmed \"Bhavni Bhavai\" with distancing effect and the use of comic characters. Hence, the film is dedicated to Bertolt Brecht and Goscinny, the creator of Astérix. It is also dedicated to the inventor of the Bhavai, Asaita Thakar, who was a Brahmin outcast and lived among the lower caste communities. The Bhavai evolved into one of India's most energetic folk music and dance-dramas. The final sequence of the stepwell and sacrifice was filmed at the World Heritage Site, Rani ki vav in Patan, Gujarat.\n\nThe chief theme of the film is struggles of Harijans. The film also presents a medieval story in modern ways. Instead of linear story, it has a circular structure.\n\n\n\"Bhavni Bhavai\" songs were composed by Gaurang Vyas and written by Dhiruben Patel.\n\n\"Bhavni Bhavai\" received a wide critical acclaim and is considered one of the best Gujarati films of all time. It was considered path-breaking for dark humour and satire because most of films of the time were based on mythology and religious stories. The film was also praised for then-novel technique of 'breaking the fourth wall'.\n\n\"The New York Times\" described it as \"Enhanced by interesting costumes and incisive dialogue, the fable combines comedy and social commentary as it moves through its classic tale.\" \"Variety\" called it \"A delightful didactic fable with sharp Brechtian influences that works on practically all levels.\" Khalid Mohamed of \"Times of India\" said, \"like a lightening red \"Bhavni Bhavai\", the Gujarati Film is very special – inventive, moving and fine grained – the film is so simple, song filled and entertaining that it is well along its way before you recognise it as a tour do farce it actually is.\" American film critic J. Hoberman called the movie \"the finest film I saw in India\" and described it as stunningly photographed and universally accessible. Director Sudhir Mishra has said that \"Bhavni Bhavai\" was one of the films that inspired him to take up filmmaking.\n\nMehta won the prestigious Nargis Dutt Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration, while Meera Lakhia won National Film Award for Best Production Design at the 28th National Film Awards. The film was selected for a festival at the Museum of Modern Art and received UNESCO Club Human Rights award at the Three Continents Festival. The film was presented at the New Indian Cinema festival held in London along with 22 other films.\n\n\n"}

The UMP was the governing party in Vanuatu from 1991 to 1998. Former prime ministers Maxime Carlot Korman and Serge Vohor came from this party. However, the UMP suffered internal struggles of its own, and in the late 1990s, Corman left to form the Vanuatu Republican Party. Serge Vohor who hails from the Island Of Santo remains the president of UMP. It won 12 seats in the 1998 elections, 15 seats in the 2002 elections and 9 seats in the 2004 elections. Despite the obvious setback, Vohor was able to form a coalition government in August 2004, but lost a confidence vote four months later. From then until the 2008 elections, Vohor and the UMP sometimes were coalition partners in the Lini government, and at other times were in the opposition, serving as the largest opposition force.

It's always resonated with people for some reason, and it was a hit as far as we've ever had a hit.

He was baptised on 4 April 1775 at Monkton Farleigh, with the name of Edward Adolphus Seymour, but later changed it to Edward Adolphus St. Maur, in the belief it was the original ancient form of the name.\n\nIn 1793 he succeeded his father in the dukedom. In 1795, in the company of Reverend John Henry Michell, he undertook a tour through England, Wales and Scotland, which he recorded in a journal, published in 1845. The tour took him as far as the Isles of Staffa and Iona in the Hebrides. He was a patron of the Free Church of England. He was a gifted mathematician and served as president of the Linnean Society of London from 1834 to 1837 and as president of the Royal Institution from 1826 to 1842. He was also a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1837 he was made a Knight of the Garter by Queen Victoria. Seymour was also set to serve as the first President of the Astronomical Society of London (later the Royal Astronomical Society), having been unanimously elected to this post at the Society's second public meeting on 29 February 1820. However, he was persuaded to resign the position within days of his election by his friend (and then President of the Royal Society) Joseph Banks, who strongly opposed the establishment of a specialist society for astronomy.\nIn 1808 he purchased a London townhouse on Park Lane which he named Somerset House, and where he spent much of his time. In addition, in 1829 he purchased from George Templer (1781–1843) the Devonshire estate of Stover in the parish of Teigngrace, near Newton Abbot, and made Stover House his principal residence, where he displayed the valuable \"Hamilton\" art collection brought as her marriage portion by his wife Lady Charlotte Hamilton, a daughter of the 9th Duke of Hamilton. This included paintings by Rubens, Lawrence and Reynolds. The principal seat of the Seymour family had been Maiden Bradley in Wiltshire, but for one more generation it remained Stover. The Stover purchase included the Stover Canal and the Haytor quarries and Haytor Granite Tramway. He added a large porte cochere with Doric columns to Stover House and built a matching entrance lodge.\n\nSomerset married twice, firstly on 24 June 1800 to Lady Charlotte Douglas-Hamilton (6 April 1772 – Somerset House, Park Lane, London, 10 June 1827), daughter of Archibald Hamilton, 9th Duke of Hamilton, by whom he had seven children:\n\nFollowing his first wife's death in 1827 he remarried on 28 July 1836 at Marylebone, Portland Place, London, to Margaret Shaw-Stewart, daughter of Sir Michael Shaw-Stewart, 5th Baronet of Blackhall, Renfrewshire, by his wife Catherine Maxwell, daughter of Sir William Maxwell, 3rd Baronet. The marriage was childless.\n\nSomerset died at Somerset House in London, in August 1855, aged 80, and was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery, London. Margaret, his second wife, died at Somerset House on 18 July 1880, and was buried with her husband.\n\n"}

It stars Naseeruddin Shah and Smita Patil in the lead roles. On the centenary of Indian cinema in April 2013, \"Forbes\" included Smita Patil's performance in the film on its list, \"25 Greatest Acting Performances of Indian Cinema\".\n\nThe film is set in Colonial India in the early 1940s. The plot begins with an arrogant \"subedar\" (Naseeruddin Shah) (local tax collector in colonial India) and his henchmen rampaging through a village. The subedar has an eye for women and soon spots Sonbai (Smita Patil) on the riverbank. Sonbai is an intelligent, beautiful and strong woman. Her confidence intrigues the \"subedar\".\n\nIt turns out the \"subedar\" holds ultimate authority over the village. Subservient to him is the \"mukhi\" (Suresh Oberoi) (village chieftain) and all the villagers. The villagers do their best to scratch out a living, of which the \"subedar\" invariably exacts a heavy tax. We learn also that the villagers are mostly illiterate and ignorant of the outside world. They are most stupefied by a gramophone the tyrant possesses. The only literate person in the village is the schoolmaster (Benjamin Gilani), who insists on educating the children, even girls (the \"mukhi's\" wife even enrolls her only daughter, only to be rebuked by the \"mukhi\", who, like all the others believes that girls should not be sent to school). The \"mukhi's\" younger brother (Mohan Gokhale) (who also loves a low-caste girl secretly) even asks the school-master the meaning of the word \"swaraj\"). The \"subedar\" and his men routinely attack the village and raid the food, livestock and supplies. The \"subedar\" is a haughty and cruel man, who exploits his power in every possible way. The villagers are compelled to keep him satisfied; they regularly set up parties for him and his men, often at great expense to their meager means. They also arrange a steady supply of women for his pleasure.\n\nThe \"mukhi\" means well but is generally weak and powerless before the \"subedar\". His principal goals are to negotiate concessions to the tax and to keep the \"subedar\" happy. The safety and security of the village are mostly dependent on the moods of the \"subedar\", and so he tacitly arranges to keep the \"subedar\" sated and out of his way. The \"mukhi\" also represents the prevailing male attitude in the village: women are mostly confined to their homes and have no education. The other character in village life is the school master, who is a Gandhian and a reformer, and hopes the village may someday be liberated from the shackles of the likes of the \"subedar\".\n\nThings take a turn when on one such occasion the \"subedar\" boldly asks Sonbai to yield to his desires. Equally bold, she slaps him across the face. She flees immediately with the soldiers in hot pursuit, and takes refuge in a \"masala karkhana\" (spice factory where red chillies are ground into powder). Abu Mian (Om Puri), the wizened old Muslim gatekeeper and factory guard admits Sonbai and slams the factory doors shut in the nick of time.\n\nThe soldiers try to coax and cajole Abu Mian into opening the door. When this fails, they try to trick him (he sees through the trick) and then they threaten his life. Abu Mian stands his ground and refuses to open the door. The \"subedar\" tries to get the factory owner to reason with Abu Mian, but this turns out to be fruitless. Abu Mian refuses to compromise on his job of providing security to the factory employees.\n\nThe matter escalates. The \"mukhi\" convenes the village panchayat. The villagers are quick to condemn Sonbai and decide that she must turn herself over to the \"subedar\". The schoolmaster opposes this view; once they give in for one woman, he says, there will be nothing to stop the \"subedar\" from demanding others, even perhaps the \"mukhi\"s own wife. (He is immediately thrashed for this.) The panchayat is dissolved and the \"mukhi\" reports back to the \"subedar\". They will hand over Sonbai on the condition that the \"subedar\" will not make further demands of this nature. The \"subedar\" laughs off this condition and has the schoolmaster thrashed soundly again. He asks the \"mukhi\" to reason with Sonbai; her obstinacy is liable to bring trouble to the entire village.\n\nThe \"mukhi\" brings pressure on Sonbai, but she stands firm. Within the factory, the women who once supported Sonbai now turn upon her. They fear that if she does not yield, the \"subedar\" may send his men to indiscriminately molest the womenfolk. Sonbai nearly relents, but is stopped by Abu Mian. She resolves to stand firm. Abu Mian chides the \"mukhi\" and the villagers; they may lord it over their wives at home, but are not man enough to face the \"subedar\", leaving Abu Mian himself as the only man in the village who has the courage to back his convictions.\n\nThe \"subedar\" orders his soldiers to charge the factory, and they smash down the door. Abu Mian manages to shoot one of the soldiers, but he is shot dead immediately after. The \"subedar\" enters the factory and tries to grab Sonbai. The women of the factory mount a sudden and surprising defense. They attack the \"subedar\" with bagfuls of lal mirch masala (fresh ground red chilli powder) in teams of two. The film ends with the \"subedar\" on his knees, screaming in pain as the chilli burns his face and eyes.\n\n"}

His father, David Cooper, was a physician and Baptist minister. His mother was Sarah Davenport. Cooper attended the University of Virginia from 1832 until 1834; his classmates included future Civil War generals Carnot Posey, Lafayette McLaws, and John B. Magruder. Cooper returned home to take up farming on \"Mon Clova\", his plantation in Wilkinson County, Mississippi in the Cold Springs community, which was a tiny village between Woodville and Natchez. He married Mary Collins of Natchez and had 7 children. Entering politics, he was elected in 1844 to serve as a Whig in the Mississippi State Legislature.\n\nCooper helped to raise a regiment during the Mexican–American War, the 1st Mississippi Rifles, and served as a captain under the command of Colonel Jefferson Davis, participating in the battles of Monterrey and Buena Vista. He was cited for bravery and gallantry at the Battle of Monterrey.\n\nIn 1853, through the influence of Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, who served with Cooper at the Mexican–American War Battle of Buena Vista, President Franklin Pierce appointed Cooper as the Federal agent to the Choctaw tribe. Cooper helped peaceably remove them to Indian Territory. Three years later, he also became the agent to the Chickasaw tribe, who respected and trusted Cooper and soon officially adopted him as a full member.\n\nIn 1858, he led a militia composed of Choctaw and Chickasaw volunteers against Comanche marauders.\n\nWith the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Cooper pledged his allegiance to the Confederacy. In May, Secretary of War Leroy Pope Walker sent Cooper a letter authorizing him to \"take measures to secure the protection of these tribes in their present country from the agrarian rapacity of the North.\" He raised a regiment known as the 1st Choctaw and Chickasaw Mounted Rifles and was commissioned as its colonel. Given brigade command, Cooper pursued the Creek Indian leader Opothleyahola in November and December, when the latter led his loyal Union followers toward Kansas. Cooper's brigade fought at the battles of Round Mountain and Chusto-Talasah, winning a decisive victory at Chustenahlah.\n\nIn 1862, Cooper led Confederate troops at the battles of Elkhorn Tavern, Newtonia and Honey Springs. He was promoted to brigadier general on May 2, 1862, and was named district commander of the Indian Territory on September 29, 1862. This promotion put him in command of all \"... (Confederate) Indian troops in the Trans-Mississippi Department on the borders of Arkansas.\" Rumors circulated that the Indians were dissatisfied with Cooper. To refute this, letters of support from Indian leaders were sent to Richmond, Virginia, to President Jefferson Davis. Cooper commanded the \"Indian Brigade\" in Indian Territory during Maj. Gen. Sterling Price's second invasion of Missouri in 1864. In 1865, Cooper was appointed Superintendent of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n\nThe Confederacy's collapse accelerated after General Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox in 1865. The Choctaw and Chickasaw tribes surrendered in April 1865, and their troops returned home immediately. Cooper ordered the surrender of all white Confederate troops in Indian Territory in June, 1865. Afterward, he swore allegiance to the United States government, and was formally pardoned in April, 1866.\n\nAfter the war, Cooper continued to live in the Indian Territory and was an ardent supporter of Choctaw and Chickasaw land claims against the Federal government. He died of pneumonia on April 29, 1879, at Fort Washita (in what is now Bryan County, Oklahoma) and was buried in the old fort cemetery in an unmarked grave.\n\n\n\n"}

Loot may often be assigned to tiers of rarity, with the rarer items being more powerful and more difficult to obtain. The various tiers of rarity are often indicated by particular colors that allow a player to quickly recognize the quality of their loot.

It was established in 1882 from the Abbey of Engelberg, Switzerland. The abbey, located on the top of Mount Angel, a , has its own post office separate from the city of Mt. Angel's—Saint Benedict.\n\nThe Seminary is located within the Archdiocese of Portland, Oregon but it also serves as the major seminary for the Diocese of Baker, the Diocese of Boise, the Diocese of Great Falls-Billings, and the Diocese of Helena. The Archdiocese of Seattle sends its College Seminarians to Bishop White Seminary along with the Diocese of Spokane and the Diocese of Yakima. The seminarians are then given the choice of attending either University of Saint Mary of the Lake or Mount Angel.\n\nThe seminary offers degrees to both lay students and those studying for the priesthood. The undergraduate school offers bachelor's degrees to seminarians in philosophy, literature, and religious studies. The graduate school offers master's degrees to both seminarians and lay students in theology, scripture studies, and philosophy.\n\nMount Angel Abbey was founded on October 30, 1882 by Benedictine monks who immigrated to the United States from Engelberg, Switzerland, who found the abbey's landscape to be similar of that which they had left in the Swiss Alps. It was conceived by Father Adelhelm Odermatt, a monk of Engelberg Abbey working in Missouri. Five years after the abbey's construction in 1882, the monks opened their school in 1887, under the name of Mount Angel College. In 1889, at the request of Archbishop William Gross of Oregon City, the monks established a seminary in conjunction with their college.\n\nIn 1903, Father Thomas Meienhofer, also a native of Switzerland, became the first abbot, and in 1904, the community was officially declared an abbey, which meant that it became independent from its motherhouse in Switzerland. In 1926, a second fire in the abbey's history destroyed its monastery, forcing the community into private homes and the nearby parish school and rectory. The monks began rebuilding, and in 1930 erected Aquinas Hall, and a gymnasium in 1936. In 1939, the Abbey's first daughterhouse, Westminster Abbey, was established in Vancouver, British Columbia. In 1946, the college was shut down so that the Abbey could focus on its seminary and boys' preparatory school. In 1959, a retreat house was constructed on the property to serve the spiritual needs of laypeople. In the early 1950s, the monastery became one of approximately 900 locations that would serve as emergency hospitals in the event of a nuclear war.\n\nIn 1965, two new monasteries were started from Mount Angel Abbey: Ascension Priory in Idaho, and Our Lady of the Angels Priory in Cuernavaca, Mexico. In 1980, Father Bonaventure Zerr was elected as the seventh abbot, establishing a new library for not only seminarians, but for the use of scholarly research. The library at the abbey was designed by Finnish architect Alvar Aalto. Though the seminary has historically been the central focus of the abbey, it has also become open to non-seminarians seeking bachelor's degrees in philosophy and theology. In the 1970s, the Abbey community had a total of 125 monks living on the grounds, making it one of the largest Benedictine male communities in the United States.\n\nMount Angel Seminary, which was originally part of the now defunct Mount Angel College, serves numerous western dioceses and currently has approximately 200 students. The college was originally composed of seven schools, but as the college turned its focus toward the seminary, the two remaining schools are the liberal arts college and the graduate school of theology. The makeup of the seminary population is 40% Anglo-American and 60% minorities, primarily Hispanic, Vietnamese, and Filipino. The Seminary's main church has a tower that contains the largest free-swinging bells on the west coast.\n\nIn 2006, a new seminary building received a Best Sustainable Award for Oregon and Washington. The following year, to commemorate the abbey's 125th anniversary, a new bell tower was erected.\n\nThe seminary has undergraduate and graduate programs. The undergraduate program is devoted towards a bachelor's degree in philosophy. Students may choose a double degree by studying one of two additional fields—religious studies or literature.

He was born in Dornoch, Scotland, but became a citizen of and spent most of his adult life in the United States. Ross started his career by being an apprentice to Old Tom Morris at St Andrews in Scotland around 1899. With the help of an American agronomy student, fellow Scotsman Robert White from St. Andrews, Ross decided to move to America. Ross invested all his life savings to move to the United States and walked off the boat with only $2. In America, he got his first job at Oakley Country Club in Watertown, Massachusetts. He quickly rose to the position of golf professional at Pinehurst Resort in North Carolina, where he began his course designing career.\n\nRoss learned several skills related to golf throughout his life such as greens keeping, club making, golf pro, and architect. Ross got his first job at the Royal Dornoch Golf Club, where he played while growing up, working as a greens keeper. Ross served an apprenticeship with Old Tom Morris in St Andrews before investing his life savings in a trip to the U.S. After his year long apprenticeship he went back to the Royal Dornoch Golf Club where he honed his playing abilities while also taking care of the greens and making clubs. Later in 1899, with the encouragement and support of Harvard astronomy professor and Salem and Petersham, Massachusetts resident Robert W. Willson, he obtained his first job in America at Oakley Country Club in Watertown, Massachusetts. In 1900 he was appointed as the golf professional at the Pinehurst Resort in North Carolina, where he began his course design career and eventually designed four courses. He then began running a substantial practice with summer offices in Little Compton, Rhode Island. At its height, Donald J. Ross and Associates, as his practice was known, oversaw the work of thousands of people. However, Ross always kept up his professional golf standing. His brother Alec won the 1907 U.S. Open.\n\nWhile working at the Oakley Country Club, Ross had left an impresssion on the president of the Boston Athletic Association at the time, Edward E. Babb. During an exchange in 1910 between Babb and Joseph L. Wyckoff, a business partner of stationary maker White & Wyckoff in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Wyckoff remarked that he wished to find a man who \"really knew about the laying out a golf course\" for the Mount Tom Golf Club, today known as Wyckoff Country Club. Babb introduced Wyckoff to Ross later that year, bringing him back to the course, where he suggested key changes, but was unable to prepare plans as he had just signed a two-year contract as professional for the Essex County Country Club. Completing this contract he returned to Holyoke in 1914 where he was put up in a house built for him by Wyckoff, who as an executive committee member of the Massachusetts Golf Association, saw himself as a patron of Ross, and offered him financial backing to move from being both an architect and golf pro, to focusing his career mainly in golf course architecture. It is unknown what duration or regularity Ross lived in Holyoke, as he travelled often, even spending time designing a course in Cuba during his tenure in Manchester that previous year, though a \"Boston Herald\" article still placed him in Holyoke in 1919. He would work with the Mount Tom Club for many years, welcoming Holyoke neighbors visiting his winter home in Pinehurst, completing a full redesign of the Mt. Tom course by 1922, and later serving as a pallbearer for Wyckoff following his death in 1931. Ross's work in Holyoke would remain largely untouched until the construction of I-91 in 1965 left only 5 fairways of his design today.\n\nRoss's most famous designs are Pinehurst No. 2, Aronimink Golf Club, East Lake Golf Club, Seminole Golf Club, Oak Hill Country Club, Glen View Club, Memphis Country Club, Inverness Club, Miami Biltmore Golf Course and Oakland Hills Country Club. Although Ross was a competitive golfer, he is primarily known for his work as a course designer. In his time as a designer he is credited with roughly 400 course designs or redesigns between 1900-1948. Some of his early work was in Virginia and includes Jefferson Lakeside Country Club and Sewell's Point Golf Course. He also designed the Municipal Golf Course at Asheville, North Carolina in 1927. Ross also designed one of Westchester, New York's best courses, Whippoorwill Country Club, in Armonk, New York; however, Charles Banks was hired by Whippoorwill to redesign the course in 1928. He also designed a 9-hole course in northern New York, known as the Schroon Lake Municipal Golf Club in 1918. He designed the Hope Valley Country Club in Durham, North Carolina in 1927.\n\nIn the 1930s, he revolutionized greenskeeping practices in the southern United States when he oversaw the transition of the putting surfaces at Pinehurst No. 2 from oiled sand to Bermuda grass. Ross also designed the course at Sedgefield Country Club in Greensboro, North Carolina which is home to the PGA Tour's Wyndham Championship. Currently, Sedgefield Country Club is the only regular Donald Ross design on the PGA Tour. Aronimink Golf Club, located in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, played host to the AT&T National in 2010 and 2011.\n\nRoss was a founding member and first president of the American Society of Golf Course Architects, which was formed at Pinehurst in 1947. He was admitted to the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1977, a high honor rarely awarded for anything other than playing success.\n\nRoss died while completing his final design at Raleigh Country Club in North Carolina. He is buried in Newton Cemetery in Newton, Massachusetts.\n\nList of Donald Ross-designed courses\n\nWhat allows a Donald Ross golf course to stand out is the design principles and elements he used. He displayed great attention to detail. Often he created challenging courses with very little earth moving; according to Jack Nicklaus, \"His stamp as an architect was naturalness.\" Some of his designs include the \"turtleback\" greens, a Ross double plateau, and The Punchbowl. The route the golfer had to take was an important decision Ross had to make and he favored very clear routes that would not require much walking. When he would design a par-4 hole, he favored an uphill short hole. Ross often created holes which invited run-up shots but had severe trouble at the back of the green, typically in the form of fall-away slopes. All of these exemplify his naturalness design philosophy which did not require intense earth moving, he simply let the lay of the land dictate what each and every hole should be. Ross would go into designing a new course with the thought to \"make each hole present a different problem. So arrange it that every stroke must be made with a full concentration and attention necessary to good golf. Build each hole in such a manner that it waste none of the ground at my disposal and takes advantage of every possibility I can see.\" His most widely known trademark is the crowned or \"turtleback\" green, most famously seen on Pinehurst No. 2, though golf architecture writer Ron Whitten argued in \"Golf Digest\" in 2005 that the effect had become exaggerated compared to Ross's intention because greenkeeping practices at Pinehurst had raised the center of the greens.\n\nRoss had a successful playing career, winning three North and South Opens (1903, 1905, 1906) and two Massachusetts Opens (1905, 1911), and finishing fifth in the 1903 U.S. Open and eighth in the 1910 Open Championship. As his fame grew, he began to teach and play less and to focus on golf course design.\n\nRoss played in the U.S. Open and The Open Championship.\n\nDNP = Did not play<br>\nWD = Withdrew<br>\nCUT = missed the half-way cut<br>\n\"T\" indicates a tie for a place<br>\nYellow background for top-10\n\n\n"}

The highway is named for Robert Campbell, a nineteenth century Hudson's Bay Company fur trader and explorer.\n\nThe first portion of the Robert Campbell Highway, between Watson Lake and Miner Junction, was built in the early 1960s as part of the project to complete road access to Tungsten, Northwest Territories. The portion east and north of Miner Junction is now the only portion still known as the Nahanni Range Road, and is Yukon Territorial Highway #10.\n\nDuring the late 1960s and continuing to 1971, highways were built to connect Carmacks with Ross River, with a spur road to Faro to serve the new lead-zinc mine that opened in 1969. Additional road work was also completed between Ross River and Miner Junction. The completed road complements the Canol Road, providing two loops and bringing year-round access to Ross River.\n\nThe Campbell Highway is mostly gravel, and the most improved section is between Carmacks and Faro, where it has the most traffic from trucks hauling ore to Whitehorse and beyond.\n\nThe highway was originally route 9, but became route 4 in 1978.

It is called progressive passive income when the earner expends little effort to grow the income. Examples of passive income include rental income and any business activities in which the earner does not materially participate. Some jurisdictions' taxing authorities, such as the Internal Revenue Service in the United States of America, distinguish passive income from other forms of income, such as earnings from regular or contractual employment, and may tax it differently.\n\nThe United States Internal Revenue Service categorizes income as active income, passive income, or portfolio income. It defines passive income as only coming from two sources, or \"passive activities\": rental activity or \"trade or business activities in which you do not materially participate.\" Other financial and government institutions also recognize it as an income obtained as a result of capital growth or in relation to negative gearing. Passive income is usually taxable.\n\nActive income is earned income including all taxable income and wages the earner receives for working. Active income includes wages, self-employment income, and material participation in an S corporation or partnership. Portfolio income is derived from investments such as dividends, interest, capital gains, and some royalties.\n\nThere are three kinds of passive activities:\n\n\nSome limited partnerships may be considered passive as long as the limited partner does not have any role in the company and exchanges their capital investment for a share of the activities profit.\n\nIn order to be considered a rental activity, tangible property is used by customers and the income paid from the activity comes from the amount paid for the use of the property and is not considered a rental if:\n\n\nThere are more types of passive income than is shown in this article. In any case, it is preferable to consult with financial advisor first.\n\nIt is one of the most popular and simplest ways to gain passive income. A person gives a certain amount of money to a bank and takes interest every month. \nThe profit, created by security, is in general inversely proportional to the risk it holds. \nBonds are debt securities issued by the state or company for gaining investments. By purchasing a bond, a person is lending savings to the issuer for a specified period. In return, he receives income at the very end of the bond validity period, or he can also earn so-called coupon income. \nIt is a reliable way to generate income passively. However, it is important to mention the research to find stocks with desirable risk/income ratio. \n\n"}

Unlike in many other systems of law, there was previously no possibility of \"post factum\" legitimisation of a bastard. This situation was changed in 1926.\n\nThe word \"bastard\" is from the Old French , which in turn was from Medieval Latin . In the modern French , the circumflex (â) merely represents the loss of the 's' over time. According to some sources, may have come from the word , which means pack saddle, the connection possibly being the idea that a bastard might be the child of a passing traveller (who would have a pack saddle). In support of this is the Old French phrase loosely meaning \"child of the saddle,\" which had a similar meaning. A more defined possibility is that such a traveller was a member of the , referring to the division of an army who arrived in town with their pack saddles the night before the troops, and left the day after, so that they may deal with all of the provisions of an army, and even do advanced scouting. This meant that for two days, they had unfettered access to all of the women in town, and were therefore the ones most likely to be the cause of the town's illegitimate offspring. (This explanation is apocryphal, but no attempt at dispute seems to have been proffered.)\n\nAnother suggestion is that a group of travelling muleteers arrived, unloaded their mules, and took their pack saddles indoors and used them as bedding to sleep on.\n\nBastardy was not a status, like villeinage, but the fact of being a bastard had a number of legal effects on an individual. \nOne exception to the general principle that a bastard could not inherit occurred when the eldest son (who would otherwise be heir) was born a bastard but the second son was born after the parents were married.\n\nThe Provisions of Merton 1235 (20 Hen. 3 c. IX), otherwise known as the Special Bastardy Act 1235, provided that except in the case of real actions the fact of bastardy could be proved by trial by jury, rather than necessitating a bishop's certificate.\n\nPost-hoc legitimisation was introduced under the Legitimacy Act 1926 (16 & 17 Geo. 5 c. 60) and the Family Law Reform Act 1969 (c. 46) allowed a bastard to inherit on the intestacy of his parents.\n\nIn Medieval Wales, prior to its conquest by and incorporation in England, a \"bastard\" was defined solely as a child not acknowledged by his father. All children acknowledged by a father, whether born in or out of wedlock, had equal legal rights including the right to share in the father's inheritance. This legal difference between Wales and England is often referred to in the well-known \"Brother Cadfael\" series of Medieval detective mysteries.\n\n\n\n"}

The MT900R was a racing version of the MT900. The basic car was updated as the MT900S for 2005, with the MT900S Photon being an optional performance package. The original MT900 was introduced in 2001 and the MT900S finished production in May 2011. Components for 25 MTs were produced as of January, 2005, though only about 35 road cars and 50 racing versions have officially been completed (c.20 of which are MT900S). The MT900 was the replacement for the Mosler Raptor.\n\nThe MT900 was designed by Rod Trenne, who previously worked on the Corvette C5. The initials were for Mosler, Trenne, and the car's 900 kilogram (1984 lb) target weight.\n\nThe MT900 used a carbon-fiber chassis with a \"LS1\" V8 engine mounted amidships, powering the rear wheels. Power output is , with torque. A ZF transaxle, designed for Porsche, was mounted upside down to allow the engine to sit in front of the rear axle.\n\nThe original MT900 weighed , much more than the target weight, but could still accelerate to in 3.5 seconds according to \"Car and Driver\". The MT900 they tested could also do a 12.0 second quarter mile at , and they recorded a top speed of , limited by the redline. The MT900 pulled 1.02 g on the skidpad. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimated and in city and highway driving, respectively.\n\nThe car had a somewhat plain exterior designed for aerodynamics, with a low 0.25 coefficient of drag. List price was US$164,000. Sales were certainly slow, and only a single prototype was produced.\nIntroduced at the same time as the basic MT900 was the race-ready MT900R. It was designed for use in various international motorsports series for an estimated price of $119,000. The MT900R made its competition debut at the 2001 24 Hours of Daytona, and would be campaigned by a factory Mosler team for the full season of the Grand American Road Racing Championship. The entry finished the year ninth in their class championship.\n\nFor 2002, the French Perspective Racing team would become the full-season entry in Grand American and saw an improvement in performance. At Daytona the MT900R finished 13th overall and fifth in their class before winning at the next round at Homestead-Miami Speedway, helping the team to third in the championship. Rollcentre Racing and Balfe Motorsport (with aid from Rollcentre) would bring the Moslers to Europe in 2003, starting the British GT Championship year strong with three straight one-two finishes, before finishing the year with four more victories. The Rollcentre squad edged out Balfe for the championship that year. In Grand American, the Moslers were moved to the faster GTS class, but Perspective Racing improved on the previous year's Daytona effort with a ninth-place finish and the class victory. Mosler Automotive would take one more victory that season.\n\nMartin Short's Rollcentre Racing team also took their MT900R to a second-place finish in the inaugural Bathurst 24 Hour in 2002 at the famous Mount Panorama Circuit in Bathurst, Australia. Rollcentre backed this up in the 2003 race with a fifth-place finish. The MT900R proved very quick on the circuit's Mountain and Conrod Straight's (both over 1 km in length), with Short finding he was able to match the speed of the Holden Monaro 427C's which used an Australian developed version of the larger 7.0L (427cui) V8 engine used in the Chevrolet Corvette C5-R's at Le Mans, as well as the 6.0L V12 powered Lamborghini Diablo GTR.\n\nRollcentre and Balfe would continue in the British GT Championship in 2004, although Balfe would also enter the Spanish GT Championship. The Moslers would struggle in British GT and score no wins, but Balfe was able to earn two victories in Spanish GT, winning the drivers' championship by a mere point. 2005 would see Balfe entering the FIA GT Championship, although the car was not homologated and could not fight for points. Rollcentre would go on to win the Britcar 24 hours at Silverstone. Escuderia Bengala and Escuderia Motor Terrasa would compete in Spanish GT, while Eclipse Motorsport and Cadena GTC took over British GT competition.\n\nLaunched in late 2006, the Mosler MT900 GT3 was an attempt by Rollcentre Racing to adapt the MT900R for compliance to the new FIA GT3 category used in various championships. However, the lack of production Moslers led to the FIA rejecting the homologation and forcing Rollcentre to turn elsewhere. The car is allowed into the International GT Open, Australian GT Championship and Belcar series along with the British GT championship which runs to GT3 rules, but has not been approved for other series which use the GT3 category. MT900R GT3's use the LS7 7.0L V8 (427cui) rather than the LS1 5.7L (350cui) version from the original MT900R.\n\nThe MT900 underwent several changes to become the MT900S, with from its Corvette Z06-derived \"LS6\" V8. The car weighs without fuel.\n\nAn early prototype MT900S, despite being up and down from the production version, posted a 0-60 mph time of 3.5 seconds and a quarter-mile time of 12 seconds flat.\n\nA newer edition with accelerated in 3.1 seconds in a \"Car and Driver\" test in early 2006.\n\nIn June 2005, Mosler announced that they had reached EPA and California Air Resources Board (CARB) certification on the MT900S, allowing road car sales to begin in the United States. The price was set at $189,000 with two examples having been built as of January 2005. George Lucas took delivery of the first street-legal MT900S in December 2006.\n\nTorque (SAE net): @ 4000 rpm\n\n\n\nA MT900S Photon variant is available which adds a Hewland transmission, thinwall subframes, Dymag carbon fiber magnesium wheels, titanium springs, and carbon fiber seats and bodywork, reducing the car's weight to just under its initial target at . As of January, 2011, a second Photon had been built and was sold for use in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 2010, Mosler announced they would release a facelifted version of MT900, based on the MT900M which participated in 2010 Super GT season. A rendering was made of the facelifted MT900 which was as far as the redesign progressed. In May 2011 production was stopped and the factory closed down.\nIn 2010 Super GT season, the MT900M made its debut at the second round of the season in Okayama by Thunder Asia Racing, a GT300 team based in Singapore. Unlike the other MT900 entered in previous Super GT seasons, it uses a 3.4L V8 Judd powered Engine and an aero kit specified for GT300 class' regulation.\n\n"}

After being spotted in a high school production, Rouverol first acted in a Hollywood motion picture at the age of seventeen, appearing as W. C. Fields' daughter in the comedy \"It's a Gift\" (1934). She continued to perform mainly in supporting roles, making another eleven films until 1940 when she married screenwriter Hugo Butler.\n\nWith four children coming in quick order, Rouverol did not return to film acting but throughout the 1940s performed on radio, including playing Betty Carter on \"One Man's Family\". While her husband was away serving in the U.S. military during World War II, she wrote her first novella, which she sold to \"McCall's\" magazine in 1945. By 1950, she had her first screenplay made into a film, but her career was interrupted as a result of the investigations by the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) into Communist influence in Hollywood.\n\nIn 1943, Rouverol and her husband had joined the American Communist Party. In 1951, when agents for HUAC attempted to subpoena them, Rouverol and her husband chose self-exile to Mexico with their four small children rather than face a possible prison sentence, as endured by some of their friends who were dubbed the Hollywood Ten. Labeled as subversives and dangerous revolutionaries by the government, they did not return to the United States on a permanent basis for thirteen years, during which time they had two more children.\n\nIn Mexico, she continued to write screenplays, short stories and articles for various American magazines to earn money. Three screenplays she co-wrote with her husband were accepted for filming by the Hollywood studios because agent Ingo Preminger arranged for friends from the Writers Guild of America to put their names on the scripts. In 1960 the family moved to Italy, so Rouverol and her husband could work on a film script. In 1961 the family, with the exception of son Michael and daughter Susan, moved to Rome for two years. After a few years, in 1964 they briefly lived in Mexico again, and then returned to the United States for good. Living in California again, she and her husband continued their screenplay collaboration. She wrote a book on Harriet Beecher Stowe. Her husband died in 1968.\n\nIn the 1970s, Rouverol returned to writing. She scripted an episode of \"Little House on the Prairie\", and after publishing three books in three years, she was hired as co-head writer for the CBS soap opera \"Guiding Light\". For this show she received a Daytime Emmy nomination and a Writers Guild of America Award. Rouverol, by then sixty years old, left the show in 1976. Her book \"Writing for the Soaps\" was published in 1984. She taught writing at the University of Southern California and at UCLA Extension.\n\nRouverol wrote scripts for \"Search for Tomorrow\" and \"As the World Turns\". She served four terms on the board of directors of the Writers Guild of America, and in 1987 she received the Guild's Morgan Cox Award as a member \"whose vital ideas, continuing efforts and personal sacrifice\" best exemplified the ideal of service to the Guild. In 2000, Rouverol (aged 84) published \"Refugees from Hollywood: A Journal of the Blacklist Years\", which told the story of her family's life in exile.\n\nFor many years Rouverol lived with actor Cliff Carpenter, who was another former blacklisted performer. Carpenter died on January 9, 2014 at the age of 98. Rouverol died on March 24, 2017 at the age of 100.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2095614", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2095614", "title": "Aurora consurgens", "text": "Aurora consurgens\n\nThe Aurora consurgens is an alchemical treatise of the 15th century famous for the rich illuminations that accompany it in some manuscripts. While in the last century, the text has been more commonly referred to as \"Pseudo-Aquinas\", there are as well arguments in favour of Thomas Aquinas, to whom it has originally been attributed in some manuscripts. The translated title from Latin into English is \"Rising dawn.\" \n\nThe argument against the authorship of Thomas Aquinas is that the style of \"Aurora consurgens\" does not correspond to that of Thomas Aquinas (except in the Fourth Parable, which in style and content is similar to the \"Expositio\" in \"Symbolum Apostolorum\", which is an oral lecture of Thomas of Aquin).\nAccording to von Franz the following arguments support the hypothesis of Thomas Aquinas being the author of \"Aurora Consurgens\": Its author knows both the Bible and liturgy intimately, he quotes rather little of classical alchemical texts and mentions neither chemical recipes nor technical instructions, which indicates a clergyman to be its author. His praising of the poor is typical for a Dominican or a Franciscan. The passionately style of being gripped could result from an intrusion of the unconscious which – as psychological experience tells - might have compensated a rather intellectual consciousness dominated by logic. The biography of Thomas Aquinas fits this, as, before his death, Thomas Aquinas is said to have had a disturbing vision, the content of which is not authenticated. But he is said to have interpreted the \"Song of Songs\" on his deathbed. Thus this treatise might well represent his last seminar or his last words.\n\n\"Aurora consurgens\" is a commentary on the Latin translation of \"Silvery Waters\" by Senior Zadith (Ibn Umayl). It also refers to the \"Song of Songs\", especially in its last (7th) parable (de confabulatione dilecti cum dilecta), which draws closely on it, in main parts paraphrasing it. Unusual for a work of this type, the text is accompanied by about thirty-seven fine miniatures in watercolour. The illustrations are representations of alchemical symbols depicted in human or animal form. For example, mercury is depicted as a serpent, gold as the sun and silver as the moon. These illustrations incorporate some of the earliest Greek alchemical symbols known, found in the \"Authentic Memoirs\" of Zosimos of Panopolis.\n\nThe visuals found in \"Aurora consurgens\" are regarded by B. Obrist as alchemical metaphors that relate to human and animal procreation, procedures like calcination and putrefaction and other motifs. The manuscript also contains pictorial metaphors combined with glass vessels which depict the stages of the alchemical art of transformation. There are other metaphors found throughout the manuscript that are used in conjunction to create chains of metaphors. Some examples of this include cosmological and philosophical principles of the concepts like \"two are one\" and \"nature vanquishes nature\". Another illustration combines the motifs of Mercury decapitating the sun and the moon with a vase filled with silver and gold flowers. Another depicts two birds holding each other in a way that forms a circle which also symbolizes \"two in one\". This exemplifies the cosmic principle of unity, shown metaphorically as the dragon biting its tail. The ouroboros biting its tail has been stylized into a medallion of three concentric circles with inscriptions referring to the unity of everything and two natures attracting and dominating each other. It is associated with the symbols of the sun, moon, mercury, and sulfur. Another example includes the eagle and the dragon, which represent mercury as a volatile and as a solidified substance, respectively. Further, the unification of the opposite principles female/male, passive/active, cold/hot, moist/dry finds expression in the coupling of the sun and the moon, a cosmological motif of central importance since it symbolizes the generation of all things.\n\n\nIn Glasgow, Sp. Coll. Ferguson MS 6 (f. 220v), a couple depicted performing intercourse are hidden under a sheet and a blue bedspread. Their child is shown sleeping in a small rocking cradle, along with a young servant boy standing at the foot of the bed. At the Staatsbibliothek in Berlin MS Ger. Quatro. 848 (f. 30v), the related illustration has been defaced by being covered with a brown wash even though they appear to be covered to their waists by bed clothes. The child and young servant boy at the end of the bed were not damaged. This implies that the defacer was likely offended by the sexual nature of the scene. Another illustration in the Berlin manuscript (f. 18r), in which the couple makes love on a bed in a forest surrounded by a wattle fence, has also been defaced with wash, although not to the same degree as the image of the couple in bed. (f. 30v). These defacements suggest that some readers of alchemical texts were offended by visualizations of sexual analogies.\n\nThe explicitness of sexual details also varies from text to text. In an illustration from Zürich Zentralbibliothek MS Rh. 172 (f. 11r), a menstruating woman bleeds profusely within a zodiac circle to illustrate her monthly cycle and the creation of menstruation and its use within the body. In the Spruch der Philosophien, Glasgow's Sp. Coll. Ferguson MS 6 (Pl. 3), the artist concealed her genitals under her skirt and reduced the blood flow, which obscures the meaning of the menstrual cloths she is holding up.\n\nThe representation of sexuality within these images also provides many points of comparison. The lovemaking of King and Queen in the \"Rosarium philosophorum\" series is derived from scenes in the \"Aurora consurgens\" and the \"Donum Dei\" series.\n\nMany patrons were interested in aesthetic and poetic contemplation and also in gaining the knowledge to perform alchemy. \"Aurora consurgens\" addresses all of the factors, implying it is directed to aristocratic and noble patrons. Some of these patrons include the margrave of Brandenburg and Barbara of Cilli, the wife of the emperor Sigismund.\n\n"}

Nothing further was heard of her until 2005, when she made contact with the \"Scottish Daily Mail\" to tell the story of her intervening years. In 2013 she made a low-key return to public performances and made new recordings for the first time since the early 1970s.\n\nMcDonald was born in 1948 in Edinburgh and moved to Glasgow, at the age of 12, with her parents, She was privately educated before moving on to the Glasgow School of Art.\n\nOn her first two albums, McDonald was backed up by many notables within the English folk-rock scene, including Richard Thompson, Dave Mattacks, Danny Thompson, Keith Tippett, Keith Christmas, the Fotheringay rhythm section, as well as Ian Whitman, Roger Powell and Michael Evans, then members of Mighty Baby. During the recording sessions for her third album in 1971, she mysteriously disappeared following a bad LSD trip.\n\nOn 23 June 2005, by which time McDonald's albums had been reissued on CD, an article by Charles Donovan appeared in \"The Independent\", the first high-profile piece about McDonald's disappearance. This prompted copycat features in local papers, the \"Glasgow Herald\" and the \"Scottish Daily Mail\". It was the latter of these that caught the eye of McDonald herself. In November 2005, McDonald turned up in the offices of the \"Scottish Daily Mail\" and told them her story. She retreated from public life after a bad LSD trip left her paranoid and hallucinating, with a ruined voice. Living with her parents and working privately in Edinburgh, she met and married bookseller Gordon Farquhar; together, they lived a nomadic lifestyle in Scotland, living on welfare benefits and moving from house to house, and later tent to tent.\n\nIn the 2005 interview McDonald said that her voice had improved and she was again interested in music, and the renewed interest in her work by the public surprised and gratified her. After that nothing more was heard of her until 2012, when she spoke to \"fRoots\" magazine. In the new interview she reveals that, since her partner's death earlier in the year, she has resumed contact with other folk musicians and is cautiously planning low-key live appearances and hoping to record new material. In an October 2013 interview with \"The Guardian\", she revealed that she had, in fact, recorded a new album, though she provided no further details about it. The new album, called \"Parnassus Revisited\", with several new songs, was made available at gigs but has not been widely distributed. A collaboration with Galloway indie folk band The Razorbills, \"Fame Fatale\", was broadcast on Stuart Maconie's Freak Zone in 2014: Shelagh also performed with this band on a number of occasions, and with Nigel H. Seymour.\n\nOn 16 January 2013, McDonald had made her first official public appearance, after more than 40 years away, as a guest of The False Beards at the Green Note, Camden, London. Among her half hour set of previously unrecorded material, she also played her version of the traditional song \"Let No Man Steal Your Thyme\" from her first album. A series of low-key appearances took place in 2014, mainly at Scottish venues, and a similar but longer tour in 2017, in collaboration with Nigel H. Seymour followed, which took in some appearances in England. It was also announced that a recording called \"Timescapes\" was forthcoming.\n\n\n\n"}

It is located in Wynnewood, a community in Lower Merion Township, Pennsylvania in Greater Philadelphia.\n\nThe school was founded in 1845 in Philadelphia, near the current location of the United States Mint. Today it has an enrollment of more than 800 students from Nursery to grade 12.\n\nInformally known as \"Friends' Central,\" the school encompasses three divisions: Lower School (nursery through 5th grades), Middle School (6th through 8th) and Upper School (9th through 12th). The Middle and Upper Schools share their campus, and the Lower School occupies its own site.\n\nThe school is widely known for the quality of its education, consistently as one of the top schools in the Philadelphia area.\n\nFriends' Central School was founded in 1845 in Philadelphia at 4th Street and Cherry Street, serving as an upper school for the Quaker primary schools with grades 7 through 12. In 1857, the school moved to 15th and Race Street, remaining at this location until 1925, when it then moved to its current campus on City Avenue (formerly the Wistar Morris Estate). The main house of the estate, constructed in 1862, remains and serves as the administrative building of the school as well as an architectural focal point of the campus. In 1988, due to the growth of the student body, Friends' Central acquired the Montgomery School's property and relocated the lower school there. Recent expansion includes construction of the Shimada Athletic Center (2000) and the Fannie Cox Center for Science, Math and Technology (2003). In 2011, David Felsen retired after 23 years of service as headmaster; beginning in the 2012 school year, Craig Sellers was named Head of School.\n\nQuaker values such as community, service, equality and integrity are all incorporated into student life. All students attend a weekly Meeting for Worship on Wednesdays for 40 minutes, sharing messages when \"moved to speak\". The community convenes in one room in silence and individuals stand when expressing thoughts to the community. Students are also required to perform off-campus service for a set of mandatory hours. In the middle and upper school, students are required to take three courses concerning the history of the Society of Friends and the central philosophies of Quakerism from a non-religious perspective. In middle school, 5th and 7th grade learn the history and faith of Quakerism, and the 9th grade course further explores the Quaker faith and practice, focusing on a deeper understanding of the religion's history and its testimonies. 11th and 12th graders may take additional study in the origin and philosophy of religion in general.\n\nFriends' Central School students achieved the highest average SAT scores in all three sections (Math, Verbal and Writing) of the 19 schools that had scores reported in Suburban Life Magazine's 2010 report on suburban Philadelphia private high schools. The scores were 649 in Math, 669 in Verbal, and 666 in Writing. This report also indicated that Friends' Central had a student-faculty ratio of 9:1, a yearly high school tuition of $25,400, and that 100% of the 93 students in the senior class went on to a four-year college.\n\nOf the 2009 graduating class, eight schools enrolled 30% of the senior class: The University of Pennsylvania (6), Muhlenberg College (4), Johns Hopkins (3), Haverford (3), Carnegie Mellon (3), Temple (3), Washington University in St. Louis (3), and Sarah Lawrence (3). Fourteen students enrolled at Ivy League institutions.\n\nFriends' Central has strong basketball and wrestling programs.

He first describes them as practising Mosaic law; though whether they were actually Jews is unclear because other editions state that they were Muslims. They were said to have fought against the Byzantine Empire as allies of the tribes of Dalmatia in 1154, during Manuel Comnenus's campaign in the Balkans. \n\nPrior to the years 889–92 some Khalis and Kabars (Kavars) of the Khazar realm had joined the Hungarian (Magyar) federation that had conquered and settled in Hungary. Another group had joined the Pechenegs. Al-Bakri (1014–1094) states that around 1068 A.D. there were considerable numbers of al-Khalis amongst the nomadic Muslim Pechenegs (Hungarian: Besenyő), that lived around the southern steppes of Russia.\n\nHe also mentions that the original al-Khalis living within the Khazar realm may have been foreign slaves from Byzantine Constantinople and/or other lands. The Pechenegs gave them the choice of staying in their country, where they could inter-marry or leave for another country of their choice. Anna Komnena in her Alexiad mentions a Pecheneg chief named Khalis.\nAbraham Harkavy hypothesized that the Khalyzians were refugees fleeing the destruction of their khaganate by the Kievan Rus in the 960s AD and the Pecheneg influx which followed in the 970s. A contemporary of Harkavy's, the Polish historian August Bielkowski, suggested that the Khalyzians were identical with the tribe known in Russian sources as the Khvalisy; hence they may have been connected to the Arsiya.\nThe maternal ancestors of the Magyarized Pecheneg clan Aba, to which the Hungarian king Samuel Aba (1041–47) belonged, were according to Hungarian chronicles of Khwarazmian origin (\"de gente Corosmina, de Corosminis orta\").\n\nKhwarezm is a city in present-day Uzbekistan, in the former Persian province of Khorasan. Since it was part of the silk road, it was known internationally, and had several different names in several different languages, including Byzantine Greek who called the products of this city \"khalisios\", which was masculine for \"of the city of khalis.\"\n\nThe province of Khwalis (Khwali-As) on the lower Volga, was the realm of the \"trading Eastern Iranians\"; its twin city Amol/Atil, also called Sariycin/Khamlikh. It was ruled by a governor with the title of Tarkhan As-Tarkhan. \n\nSource: Harvard Ukrainian Studies, Volume II, Number 3, September 1978, p.262 (Ukrainian Research Institute, Harvard University Cambridge, Massachusetts). \n\nBudakalász (Hungary), Kalász (Hungary/Slovakia), Halych (Ukraine), Kalasë (Albania) and numerous places in Russia (Kalasevo: Respublika Mordoviya), Iran (Kalash Garan: Ostan-e Lorestan), Afghanistan (Kalizeh: Velayat-e Helmand) and Punjab Pakistan (Kalis/Kalas).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2095652", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2095652", "title": "Pennsylvania Route 61", "text": "Pennsylvania Route 61\n\nPennsylvania Route 61 (PA 61) is an state highway in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. The route is signed on a north–south direction, from U.S. Route 222 Business (US 222 Bus.) in Reading northwest to US 11/US 15 in Shamokin Dam. PA 61 heads north from Reading through Berks County to Hamburg, where it meets Interstate 78 (I-78)/US 22. The route continues into the Coal Region in Schuylkill County and heads through Schuylkill Haven, Pottsville, Frackville (where it has an interchange with I-81), and Ashland. PA 61 passes through the southern part of Columbia County, where it turns west in Centralia, before it heads into Northumberland County and runs west through Mount Carmel, Kulpmont, Shamokin, and Sunbury. The route crosses the Susquehanna River into Snyder County and soon reaches its northern terminus.\n\nPA 61 roughly follows the alignment of the Centre Turnpike, a turnpike between Reading and Sunbury that was completed in 1814. The road between Reading and Sunbury became part of US 120 when the U.S. Highway System was created in 1926. In 1935, this section of road became part of US 122, a route than ran from US 1 in Oxford north to US 11/US 111 in Northumberland. US 122 saw multiple upgrades and realignments in the following years. In 1963, US 122 was decommissioned and PA 61 was designated onto the former alignment of US 122 between US 222 (now US 222 Bus.) in Reading and PA 147 in Sunbury. Upgrades and realignments continued to be made to PA 61. In 1990, the route was extended north from Sunbury to US 11/US 15 in Shamokin Dam. A section of PA 61 south of Centralia was closed in 1993 after the Centralia mine fire damaged the road and made it unsafe to travel on; this section was bypassed with a realignment to a parallel road through Byrnesville. The closed section of PA 61 was used by pedestrians and bicyclists and was covered with graffiti before being blocked to public access and covered with dirt in 2020.\n\nPA 61 begins at US 222 Bus. in the city of Reading in Berks County, heading west on two-lane undivided Greenwich Street, which is maintained by the city. The road intersects Centre Avenue and North 4th Street a short distance apart, at which points the route briefly splits into the one-way pair of Centre Avenue northbound and North 4th Street southbound and becomes state-maintained. At the intersection of North 4th Street and Centre Avenue, both directions of PA 61 continue northwest on two-lane undivided Centre Avenue, passing through urban areas of homes. The road becomes three lanes with one northbound lane and two southbound lanes and curves north, running between residences and businesses to the west and a large cemetery to the east. The route narrows to two lanes and continues past urban development. PA 61 heads into commercial areas and widens to four lanes, crossing Norfolk Southern's Spruce Street Industrial Track at-grade before passing to the east of FirstEnergy Stadium, the home ballpark of Minor League Baseball's Reading Fightin Phils. The road heads into Muhlenberg Township and becomes a divided highway as it reaches a partial cloverleaf interchange with the PA 12 freeway (Warren Street Bypass).\n\nPast this interchange, the route continues north into suburban areas as Pottsville Pike, a four-lane divided highway with some intersections controlled by jughandles. PA 61 heads past businesses and passes under Norfolk Southern's Reading Line. The road becomes undivided and runs through more commercial areas. The route briefly becomes a divided highway again at the Bellevue Avenue intersection, heading to the west of the Reading Outer Station along the Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad. The highway transitions to a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane and passes under the Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad's Reading Division line. PA 61 runs past businesses and industrial development before it heads through the community of Tuckerton, where it passes homes and businesses. The road becomes a four-lane divided highway as it comes to a partial cloverleaf interchange with the US 222 freeway. Following this, the route enters Ontelaunee Township and runs along the east bank of the Schuylkill River as it passes through the community of Ontelaunee. PA 61 heads farther from the river and crosses under a Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad line, entering industrial areas and passing west of the Ontelaunee Energy Facility. The road heads near more commercial development and curves northwest, crossing Maiden Creek. The route runs through farmland and comes to an intersection with the western terminus of PA 73. Past this intersection, PA 61 passes a mix of businesses and fields before it enters the borough of Leesport. Here, the road turns into four-lane undivided South Centre Avenue and runs past homes and some businesses. The route becomes North Centre Avenue and passes more residences, running to the east of a Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad line.\nPA 61 leaves Leesport for Ontelaunee Township again, where it becomes four-lane divided Pottsville Pike and passes a few businesses. The road curves north and heads through a mix of fields and woods with some residential and commercial development to the east of the railroad tracks, with the Schuylkill River further to the west, bending northeast and entering Perry Township. The route curves north and continues through rural land with some industrial development, with the river and railroad tracks heading further to the west. PA 61 runs through more farmland and woodland before it becomes the border between the borough of Shoemakersville to the west and Perry Township to the east, passing businesses and coming to an intersection with the northern terminus of PA 662. From here, the road fully enters Shoemakersville before crossing into Perry Township, heading north-northwest past homes and businesses with some farmland. The route becomes undivided and curves north in a wooded area, entering Windsor Township and passing more roadside development. PA 61 crosses into the borough of Hamburg and runs past businesses as a four-lane divided highway, coming to an intersection with South 4th Street which heads north into the center of the borough. From here, the route curves northwest as an unnamed road and passes over a Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad line, heading into wooded areas with the Schuylkill River to the southwest and businesses and industrial development to the northeast. The road passes over the river, entering Tilden Township, and continues over Old Route 22 and the Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad's Reading Division line. PA 61 comes to a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-78/US 22 and heads past businesses, passing east of a Cabela's store. The road runs through farm fields before it enters forested areas, crossing over the Schuylkill River Trail and coming to a bridge over the Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad's Reading Division line and the Schuylkill River.\n\nUpon crossing the Schuylkill River, PA 61 enters the borough of Port Clinton in Schuylkill County and passes over the Appalachian Trail before crossing through a gap in forested Blue Mountain along with the river. The road becomes Center Street and curves north, running between homes and some businesses to the west and the mountain to the east. The route heads into West Brunswick Township, becoming Centre Turnpike and heading north through forested mountains with the Little Schuylkill River to the west and a tract of Weiser State Forest to the east. PA 61 heads through a mix of fields and woods and passes over the river and the Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad's Reading Division line before coming to PA 895 at a jughandle-controlled intersection in the community of Molino. At this point, PA 895 joins PA 61 for a concurrency and the two routes head northwest along a four-lane divided highway with a Jersey barrier, running through a mix of farm fields and woods. The road heads into the borough of Deer Lake, passing through wooded areas with nearby residential neighborhoods. PA 895 splits from PA 61 at a jughandle-controlled intersection by heading southwest, with PA 61 splitting into a one-way pair carrying two lanes in each direction. The northbound direction heads past development while the southbound direction bypasses the development to the west, leaving Deer Lake for West Brunswick Township and heading through the community of Pinedale. The route becomes a four-lane divided highway with a Jersey barrier and some intersections controlled by jughandles, continuing northwest past fields and woods with some residential and commercial development. PA 61 curves to the west and becomes a four-lane undivided road, passing south of Geisinger St. Luke's Hospital, before becoming a three-lane road with one northbound lane and two southbound lanes and entering North Manheim Township. The route becomes three lanes with two northbound lanes and one southbound lanes before transitioning to a four-lane road as it passes south of the borough of Orwigsburg, briefly becoming three lanes with one northbound lane and two southbound lanes at the Greenview Road intersection. The road becomes a four-lane divided highway and reaches PA 443 at a jughandle-controlled intersection.\n\nAt this point, PA 443 heads west for a concurrency with PA 61, and the two routes run west-southwest through business areas as Center Avenue. The road passes to the south of the Penn State Schuylkill university campus before it continues past more development. The two routes enter the borough of Schuylkill Haven and become a four-lane undivided road, passing homes. PA 443 splits to the south and PA 61 continues west, passing businesses and crossing back into North Manheim Township. The route widens to a four-lane divided highway with several intersections controlled by jughandles and comes to an intersection with the northern terminus of PA 183 east of the borough of Cressona. Here, the road curves north and becomes unnamed, passing between the Cressona Mall and businesses to the west and woodland to the east. PA 61 continues north a short distance to the east of the Schuylkill River and passes through a narrow valley straddling Second Mountain and Sharp Mountain.\n\nFarther north, the route continues through wooded areas with some development and bends northwest, intersecting Centre Street, which crosses the Schuylkill River into the borough of Mount Carbon. PA 61 passes through a section of the borough of Palo Alto before it comes to a bridge over a Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad line and enters the city of Pottsville. Here, the road becomes South Claude A. Lord Boulevard and passes near commercial development, crossing the Schuylkill River before coming to an intersection with US 209. Past this intersection, PA 61 becomes a four-lane undivided road and runs past businesses to the east of Center City Pottsville, becoming North Claude A. Lord Boulevard after crossing East Norwegian Street. The route heads near residential and commercial development with some wooded areas, becoming a divided highway and curving to the northeast. The road turns north and leaves Pottsville for Norwegian Township, passing through woodland as Pottsville-St. Clair Highway. PA 61 heads into business areas and passes to the east of Fairlane Village Mall, entering East Norwegian Township. The route bends north-northwest and enters the borough of St. Clair, where it becomes Joseph H. Long Boulevard and runs between wooded areas to the west and residential areas to the east, curving to the north and passing west of a shopping center. PA 61 leaves St. Clair for New Castle Township and becomes an unnamed four-lane undivided highway that heads into forested mountains to the west of Mill Creek. The road curves northwest and becomes a three lane road with one northbound lane and two southbound lanes that reaches the community of Darkwater, where it turns to the north. The route becomes four lanes again and continues through forests, becoming a divided highway. PA 61 turns northwest and the median widens as it winds north through mountainous areas, becoming Skyline Drive and crossing into Blythe Township. The divided road curves to the northwest through more woodland before it comes to an interchange with Schuylkill Mall Road that provides access to a commercial area to the west of the road. The median of the route narrows and it continues into Ryan Township, coming to a cloverleaf interchange with I-81.\nPast this interchange, PA 61 enters West Mahanoy Township and becomes South Lehigh Avenue, heading north-northwest past businesses. The route narrows to a two-lane undivided road and heads into the borough of Frackville, where it is lined with homes and a few businesses. In the commercial downtown, PA 61 turns west-southwest onto West Oak Street, with PA 924 continuing north on South Lehigh Avenue. PA 61 continues past residences and a few businesses before it leaves Frackville for Butler Township and runs through the residential community of Englewood. The road heads into forested mountain areas and winds to the west, passing to the north of Ashland Reservoir before gaining a second southbound lane. The route straightens out and heads west as a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane, passing some homes and heading north of North Schuylkill Junior Senior High School. Farther west, the road becomes three lanes with one northbound lane and two southbound lanes before narrowing to two lanes. PA 61 becomes Fountain Street and heads west-southwest to the community of Fountain Springs, where it runs through residential areas and turns northwest onto Broad Street. The road gains a center turn lane and runs through forests with some homes, curving to the north. The route enters the borough of Ashland and becomes South Hoffman Boulevard, passing near commercial development and curving northeast to cross a Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad line at-grade and Mahanoy Creek. PA 61 turns north and becomes a two-lane divided highway that runs through residential areas, coming to an intersection with PA 54. At this point, PA 61 turns west to become concurrent with PA 54 on two-lane undivided Centre Street, heading through the commercial downtown of Ashland. Farther west, the road runs past homes. PA 61 splits from PA 54 by turning north onto four-lane divided North Memorial Boulevard, passing to the west of an industrial area before heading into forests.\n\nPA 61 enters Conyngham Township in Columbia County and heads northeast through dense forests as an unnamed four-lane undivided road. Farther northeast, the route narrows to a three lane road with one northbound lane and two southbound lanes. PA 61 curves east and becomes two-lane undivided Byrnesville Road, which is designated SR 2002. The former divided highway alignment of PA 61 past this point has been closed because of the Centralia mine fire that has made the road unsafe to travel on. PA 61 follows Byrnesville Road northeast through forests before passing through the abandoned community of Byrnesville. The route curves northwest through more woods and rejoins the closed alignment, at which point SR 2002 ends. At this point, PA 61 enters the borough of Centralia, which has largely been abandoned because of the mine fire, as two-lane undivided Locust Avenue. The road runs north through abandoned areas of the borough which have been overgrown with trees. PA 61 turns west onto West Centre Street, with PA 42 continuing north along Locust Avenue. From here, the route heads west through more abandoned sections of Centralia. The road leaves Centralia for Conyngham Township again and becomes an unnamed four-lane divided highway, heading through forested areas and passing to the south of a large coal mine.\n\nPA 61 enters Mount Carmel Township in Northumberland County and reaches a pair of jughandles at the county line before continuing west through forested areas. The route enters the borough of Mount Carmel and becomes two-lane undivided East 5th Street, lined with homes. PA 61 turns north onto four-lane South Market Street, passing residences and businesses. The road becomes North Market Street at the intersection with East 3rd Street. The route turns west onto two-lane East Mount Carmel Avenue and is lined with homes. The road name changes to West Mount Carmel Avenue after the intersection with North Oak Street. PA 61 turns north onto North Poplar Street and crosses back into Mount Carmel Township, curving west and widening to a four-lane unnamed road that passes north of the residential community of Atlas. The road heads past businesses and crosses PA 54 in the community of Strong. The route passes north of homes in Strong as Front Street before it runs through wooded areas with some residential and commercial development. PA 61 heads into the borough of Kulpmont, becoming Chestnut Street and running past homes and businesses. The road narrows to two lanes and runs through the commercial downtown of Kulpmont before running through more residential areas. The route leaves Kulpmont for Coal Township and becomes an unnamed four-lane road, passing through forested areas with some businesses. PA 61 passes to the north of the community of Ranshaw and comes to an interchange with the western terminus of PA 901, which provides access to Ranshaw along with the community of Coal Run to the north. Following this interchange, the road continues through wooded areas and businesses, with several intersections controlled by jughandles, passing north of the community of Marshallton. The route enters the city of Shamokin and becomes two-lane undivided Mt. Carmel Street, heading northwest into residential areas. PA 61 turns west onto East Sunbury Street and runs past more homes and a few businesses, curving southwest. The road becomes West Sunbury Street at the North 8th Street intersection and comes to a junction with the northern terminus of PA 125. From here, the route passes more development and turns northwest onto North 6th Street.\nPA 61 leaves Shamokin for Coal Township again, becoming an unnamed road and passing over the Shamokin Valley Railroad and the Shamokin Creek before coming to an intersection with the northern terminus of PA 225. The road curves north and runs through forested areas, with PA 225 parallel to the west and the creek and railroad line parallel to the east as it traverses a gap in Big Mountain. PA 225 curves away to the west and the route bends northwest and widens to a four-lane divided highway, passing southwest of the residential community of Uniontown and curving to the west. PA 61 crosses the Shamokin Creek and turns to the north, heading through a gap in forested Little Mountain with the creek to the west and the Shamokin Valley Railroad to the east and entering Ralpho Township. The road passes commercial development and a coal mine in the community of Weigh Scales before it crosses to the west side of the Shamokin Creek, at which point it enters Shamokin Township. The route winds north through more woodland with some commercial areas, with the Shamokin Valley Railroad and the Shamokin Creek to the east. PA 61 curves northwest and intersects the southern terminus of PA 487 in the community of Paxinos. From here, the road curves west runs to the north of the residential community of Sunfftown before narrowing to a two-lane undivided road and heading through woodland. The route continues west through woodland with some farm fields and homes, running through the community of Stonington and bending to the northwest.\nPA 61 heads west and becomes the border between Upper Augusta Township to the north and Rockefeller Township to the south, passing through forests with some fields and residential development. The road fully enters Upper Augusta Township and runs through residential areas with some nearby farmland and woodland, becoming State Street. The route comes to an intersection with the northern terminus of PA 890 in the community of Hamilton. From here, PA 61 turns north and crosses under the Shamokin Valley Railroad, at which point it enters the city of Sunbury. The road becomes Market Street and curves west, coming to a bridge over the Shamokin Creek. The route passes near businesses and bends southwest, coming to an intersection with the southern terminus of southbound PA 61 Truck at Wolverton Street. PA 61 curves west and becomes lined with homes, bending to the west-northwest and passing a mix of homes and businesses. The road enters the commercial downtown of Sunbury and intersects the beginning of northbound PA 61 Truck at North 5th Street. The route passes through more of the downtown and crosses Norfolk Southern's Buffalo Line at-grade, at which point it splits into a one-way pair with a town square between the one-way streets and passes north of the Northumberland County Courthouse. PA 61 becomes a two-lane road again and passes homes before it reaches an intersection with PA 147 on the east bank of the Susquehanna River. At this point, PA 61 turns south-southwest for a concurrency with PA 147 on South Front Street, intersecting the beginning of southbound PA 61 Truck at Chestnut Street. The two routes continues south between the river to the west and a mix of homes and commercial areas to the east. Farther south, the road runs to the west of residential areas. PA 61 splits from PA 147 at an interchange, heading west as a four-lane undivided road to cross the Susquehanna River on the Veterans Memorial Bridge, leaving Sunbury and running through Upper Augusta Township while crossing the river. Upon crossing the river, the route enters the borough of Shamokin Dam in Snyder County and reaches its northern terminus at a trumpet interchange with US 11/US 15.\n\nOn March 25, 1805, the Centre Turnpike Road Company was chartered to build the Centre Turnpike, a turnpike running from Reading northwest to Sunbury along the rough alignment of present-day PA 61. Construction of the Centre Turnpike began in 1808 and was completed in 1814. Following the passage of the Sproul Road Bill in 1911, what is now PA 61 was designated as Legislative Route 160 between Reading and Hamburg, Legislative Route 141 between Hamburg and Schuylkill Haven, Legislative Route 140 between Schuylkill Haven and Pottsville, and Legislative Route 161 between Pottsvile and Sunbury. \n\nWith the creation of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, the road between Reading and Sunbury was designated as part of US 120, a route that ran from Philadelphia northwest to Erie. At this time, the entire length of US 120 between US 22 in Reading and Sunbury was paved. In 1927, PA 42 was designated concurrent with US 120 between Reading and Centralia, PA 45 was designated concurrent with US 120 between Ashland and Shamokin, and PA 55 was designated concurrent on the section of US 120 between Shamokin and Sunbury. The concurrent state routes were removed from US 120 between Reading and Sunbury in 1928. \n\nIn May 1935, the eastern terminus of US 120 was truncated to US 220 in Lock Haven. US 122 was designated in April 1935 to run from US 1 in Oxford north to US 11/US 111 in Northumberland, replacing PA 42 between Oxford and Reading and US 120 between Reading and Northumberland, effective in May 1935. US 122 was rerouted to bypass Orwigsburg to the southwest by 1940, having previously followed Brick Hill Road, Market Street, and present-day PA 443 through the town. In the 1930s, US 122 was widened to a multilane road between Reading and Leesport, from a point north of Shoemakersville to Hamburg, between a point south of Schuylkill Haven and Pottsville, for a short distance south of Frackville, and for a short distance north of Shamokin. US 122 was upgraded to a multilane road in the 1940s between Leesport and north of Shoemakersville, between Port Clinton and south of Orwigsburg, between St. Clair and south of Frackville, between Frackville and Shamokin, between north of Weigh Scales and north of Paxinos, and for a short distance north of Stonington. In the 1940s, US 122 was realigned to bypass Center City Pottsville to the east along Pottsville Boulevard between US 209 in Pottsville and south of St. Clair, having previously followed Centre Street through Center City Pottsville and Nichols Street and Ann Street between Pottsville and St. Clair By 1953, US 122 was rerouted to bypass Hamburg to the west on a divided highway between south of Hamburg and Port Clinton, having previously followed 4th Street and Port Clinton Avenue between Hamburg and Port Clinton. US 122 was upgraded to a divided highway in the 1950s between north of Leesport and north of Shoemakersville, along the bypass of Orwigsburg, from north of St. Clair to south of Frackville, between Ashland and the border between Columbia and Northumberland counties, and between Weigh Scales and Paxinos. In the 1950s, US 122 was upgraded to a divided highway from Schuylkill Haven through Pottsville to south of St. Clair, being realigned to bypass Mount Carbon. This alignment of US 122 bypassed the previous alignment that followed Centre Street through Mount Carbon north to US 209 in Pottsville.\n\nUS 122, which had been replaced with PA 10 between Oxford and Morgantown in the 1950s, was decommissioned in 1963. The section of US 122 between Morgantown and Reading became a northern extension of PA 10 while the section between Reading and Sunbury was designated PA 61. When designated, PA 61 ran from US 222 (now US 222 Bus.) in Reading northwest to PA 147 in Sunbury. In 1966, PA 54 was designated concurrent with PA 61 between Ashland and north of Atlas. In the 1960s, PA 61 was upgraded to a divided highway between north of Tuckerton and north of Leesport, between north of Shoemakersville and south of Hamburg, and between Port Clinton and Deer Lake. The section of PA 61 through Pottsville was renamed Claude A. Lord Boulevard in the 1960s. By 1989, PA 61 was realigned to bypass St. Clair to the west along a divided highway, having previously followed 2nd Street through the town. In 1990, the northern terminus of PA 61 was extended from PA 147 in Sunbury across the Susquehanna River to US 11/US 15 in Shamokin Dam.\nBecause of the long-term coal mine fire in Centralia, the original alignment of PA 54/PA 61, which went from Centralia to Ashland, has been permanently closed because the road has severely opened up and buckled extensively. This branch was repaired in 1983 for $500,000; then in 1992 it was deemed too expensive to repair again. In 1993, the branch was permanently closed, and as a result of this, graffiti were scattered along the closed portion of the roadway. In 1999, Byrnesville Road (SR 2002), located directly south of the closed section of PA 61, was upgraded and now carries PA 61, bypassing the section of PA 61 which was damaged by the underground mine fire in Centralia. By 2000, PA 54 was rerouted from PA 61 between Ashland and Atlas to bypass Centralia to the southwest along PA 901 and three quadrant routes. The closed section of the road was used by pedestrians and bicyclists and was covered with graffiti. The closed portion of PA 61 was known as \"Graffiti Highway\". In 2018, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) vacated ownership of the closed section of PA 61, which reverted to adjacent property owners, mostly to Pitreal Corporation, a subsidiary of Pagnotti Enterprises. Work on blocking public access by covering the abandoned highway with dirt took place in April 2020.\n\nIn September 2012, PennDOT began a project to widen and improve the section of PA 61 through Deer Lake as the road saw a high accident rate. The project, which cost $35 million, widened the road from three lanes to four lanes between the south end of the PA 895 concurrency in Molino and Brick Hill Road north of Deer Lake and added traffic lights and jughandles at intersections. In addition, a new southbound roadway was built through Deer Lake, with the original roadway becoming the northbound lanes. The widening of PA 61 through Deer Lake was completed in 2015.\n\nAs part of the Central Susquehanna Valley Transportation Project, PA 61 is planned to continue westward from its current northern terminus, ending instead at a junction with a new limited-access roadway carrying US 15. Instead of joining with PA 147 briefly in Sunbury, the two will run together from the southern end of the current duplex to the new northern terminus at US 15.\n\nPennsylvania Route 61 Truck (PA 61 Truck) is a truck route of PA 61 bypassing a weight-restricted bridge over Laurel Run in Muhlenberg Township, on which trucks over 34 tons and combination loads over 40 tons are prohibited. The route follows PA 12, PA 183, and US 222. PA 61 Truck was signed in 2013.\n\nPennsylvania Route 61 Truck (PA 61 Truck) is a truck route of PA 61 in Sunbury that helps larger vehicles avoid a narrow town square area and a tight intersection with PA 147. The northbound truck route splits from PA 61 in the downtown area by heading north on two-lane undivided North 5th Street for two blocks. Northbound PA 61 Truck turns west-northwest onto one-way Arch Street, passing a mix of homes and businesses and crossing Norfolk Southern's Buffalo Line at-grade. The northbound truck route ends at PA 147 on the east bank of the Susquehanna River, which heads south to provide access to PA 61. The southbound truck route begins at PA 61/PA 147 on the east bank of the Susquehanna River, heading east-southeast on one-way Chestnut Street. Southbound PA 61 Truck runs past residences and businesses, crossing Norfolk Southern's Buffalo Line at-grade. The truck route continues southeast onto Wolverton Street, passing between homes to the north and industry to the south and curving east. The road runs to the north of the Shamokin Valley Railroad and bends northeast past more homes and commercial establishments. Southbound PA 61 Truck ends at an intersection with PA 61 in the eastern part of Sunbury.\n\n"}
{"id": "2095654", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2095654", "title": "The Rally (New Caledonia)", "text": "The Rally (New Caledonia)\n\nThe Rally (; until 2004 Rally for Caledonia in the Republic, ; from 2004 to 2014 Rally–UMP) is a conservative political party in New Caledonia, strongly supportive of the French status of the region; it is affiliated with the French party Les Republicains.\n\nIn 1977, which saw the start of an outright nationalist movement on the left, anti-nationalist (loyalist) Caldoche leader Jacques Lafleur founded the Rally for Caledonia (RPC) which became the Rally for Caledonia in the Republic (RPCR) in 1978 following its affiliation with the Rally for the Republic (RPR) in France. The RPCR was originally a big tent for a large majority of loyalists, whether they were liberals or close supporters of Jacques Chirac (such as Lafleur). However, the first cracks in the RPCR appeared in 1995, when Lafleur broke his historical friendship with Chirac to endorse Balladur in the 1995 presidential election in France. Didier Leroux, the strongman of the local managerial trade union and a close supporter of Jacques Chirac, left the RPCR to found a party named A New Caledonia for All. However, the RPCR remained, by far, the largest loyalist party in the 1994 and 1999 elections. It became the Rassemblement-UMP after the creation of the Union for a Popular Movement in France in 2002, but kept the RPCR acronym.\n\nHowever, the RPCR started massively cracking ahead of the 2004 elections. In 2004, a group of RPCR dissidents who opposed Lafleur’s authoritarian leadership formed the Future Together party. The new party included Marie-Noëlle Thémereau, who had left the RPCR in 2001 and supported Lionel Jospin in the 2002 French presidential election; Harold Martin, Lafleur’s dauphin but excluded in 2003 for running a dissident list in the 2001 local elections; and Philippe Gomès, a friend of Martin.\n\nIn the 2004 election, the RPCR obtained its worst result to date, obtaining 24.43% and only 16 Congressmen. Future Together won 22.69% and 16 seats, but it won more votes than the RPCR in the loyalist stronghold of South Province. Gomès became Provincial President, and Harold Martin became President of the Government of New Caledonia.\n\nIn 2005, Lafleur announced his intentions to step down in favour of Pierre Frogier, who represented New Caledonia's 2nd constituency and was a close supporter of the President of the UMP in France, soon-to-be-President Nicolas Sarkozy. Frogier was seen as Lafleur's chosen successor. However, he came back on this decision and ran against Frogier for the RPCR leadership at the party congress. Frogier defeated Lafleur by a large margin, and Lafleur left the RPCR to form the Rally for Caledonia (RPC).\n\nDespite its decline, the RPCR held both of New Caledonia's seats in the French National Assembly in the 2007 elections. In the 1st constituency, representing the capital city of Nouméa, Gaël Yanno defeated a Kanak nationalist but most notably the incumbent, Jacques Lafleur, who had won the seat since 1986.\n\nIn the 2009 election, the RPCR obtained a lower result than in 2004, despite the division in Future Together. The RPCR obtained only 20.3% and a mere 13 Congressmen. However, the RPCR became the largest party in the New Caledonia and regained first place in the South Province.\n"}
{"id": "2095655", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2095655", "title": "Future Together", "text": "Future Together\n\nThe Future Together (, ) was a center-right political party in New Caledonia supporting the maintenance of political and administrative ties with France.\n\nThe name \"l'Avenir Ensemble\" reflects the party's desire to unite New Caledonians of all ethnic groups (White Europeans, Melanesian Kanaks, Polynesian immigrants, etc.) into a shared future, rejecting the ethnic oppositions of the hitherto dominant parties of New Caledonia (White anti-independence parties vs. Kanak pro-independence parties). \"L'Avenir Ensemble\" believes in a multi-ethnic and multi-cultural future for New Caledonia.\n\nThe party's predecessor, A New Caledonia for All (Une Nouvelle-Calédonie pour Tous, UNCT) or Alliance (after 1998) was founded in 1995 by Didier Leroux, a former member of the dominant anti-nationalist Rally for Caledonia in the Republic (RPCR). Leroux was an early opponent of Jacques Lafleur within the RPCR. Leroux led the NO campaign in the Nouméa Accord referendum in 1998. Despite Leroux being François Bayrou's representative on the island and a member of Bayrou's Union for French Democracy (and now MoDem), a number of members of the original Alliance are members of the Union for a Popular Movement.\n\nThe then-dominant loyalist party, the RPCR was weakened in 2003 and 2004 by a series of dissidents, who opposed Jacques Lafleur's domination of the RPCR. These dissidents included Marie-Noëlle Thémereau, who had left the RPCR in 2001; Harold Martin, once Lafleur's dauphin but excluded in 2003 for running a dissident list in the 2001 election; and Philippe Gomès, a friend of Martin. These dissidents formed a party called Future Together.\n\nIn the 2004 provincial elections, the party shocked observers by winning as many seats as the RPCR (16 seats nationally, though it polled slightly fewer votes than the RPCR). As a result, Thémereau (and later Martin) became President of the Government of New Caledonia. Gomès became President of the loyalist stronghold, the South Province. In the South, the party had polled more votes than the RPCR, despite the province being considered the RPCR's stronghold on the island.\n\nThe party split in 2008. This split started in the 2007 legislative election, when Gomès ran in New Caledonia's 1st constituency despite Didier Leroux being supposed to run. Though both ran, and both polled 14%, they got third and fourth leaving the RPCR candidate Gaël Yanno against the candidate of the nationalist FLNKS, which Yanno easily defeated. Martin was also defeated running the New Caledonia's 2nd constituency. Poor results in the 2008 local elections, including the capital, Nouméa, precipitated an open split between Gomès on one side and Martin-Leroux on the other. In 2008, Gomès and 12 Future Together Congressmen and women (including Thémereau) formed Caledonia Together.\n\nIn the 2009 provincial elections, the party, associated with the Movement for Diversity of senator Simon Loueckhote, placed third winning (behind the winners, the RPCR, and Caledonia Together) 11.71% and only 6 seats (8 including the party's smaller allies).\n"}

It was founded in 1984 at a congress of various political parties. Its supporters are mostly from the Kanak indigenous population but also include supporters from other ethnic communities.\n\nThis is composed of the Caledonian Union (UC) (a centre-left formerly multi-ethnic party dating back to the early postwar period) on the one hand and the National Union for Independence (UNI) on the other. The UNI includes Melanesian Progressive Union (a political movement based on the island's west coast and mainly around the village of Poya, where its founder, the late Edmond Nekiriai hails from), the Oceanian Democratic Rally (a Polynesian (Wallisian-and-Futunian) based party) and the Party of Kanak Liberation (PALIKA), a more radical party founded by left-leaning students that came back from France after the May 1968 riots. Both the UC and UNI are of approximately equal size, and with varying rhetoric. However, all support the independence of New Caledonia. The party boycotted the 1987 independence referendum.\n\nThe party has been divided since the early 1990s between the Caledonian Union and UNI, and, as a result, the two factions often run candidates and lists against each other and neither can agree on a leader of the FLNKS. The coalition only has a spokesperson, Victor Tutugoro.\n\nAn attempt to re-unite the party was made on the occasion of the 2007 legislative elections in France, in which both New Caledonian constituencies were up for election. In New Caledonia's 1st constituency, Charles Washetine, a member of UNI-Palika ran with a Caledonian Union running mate. In New Caledonia's 2nd constituency, the leader of the Caledonian Union, Charles Pidjot, ran with a UNI-Palika running mate. However, both were defeated by the candidates of The Rally-UMP.\n\nThe FLNKS ran a common list in the South Province in the 2009 election which obtained 8.82% and 4 seats in the province. In the province during the 2004 elections, the pro-independence faction was divided and did not win any seats.\n\n\n"}

In the latest legislative elections of May 10, 2009, the party won around 11.65% of the popular vote, and 9 out of 54 seats in the Territorial Congress.\n\nThe Caledonian Union was born as a cross-community (multi-ethnic) autonomist party led by Maurice Lenormand, who was the island's sole representative in the French National Assembly. There he sat with the Popular Republican Movement, or MRP, and other Christian democratic parties in France.\n\nThe party's first significant success was on February 8, 1953 with the election of 15 members of the Caledonian Union to the 25 seats General Council.\n\nHowever, the UC opposed to the arrival of Gaullist centralism in France, which undid most of the autonomist reforms of the French Fourth Republic (the Defferre laws). The UC grew more and more radical, and started flirting with independence, which eventually led to an outflow of Caldoches into new loyalist parties, such as the Rally for Caledonia in the Republic. Combined with corruption scandals, this weakened the party considerably.\n\nIn 1977 in Bourail, the UC adopted a nationalist platform, supported by Jean-Marie Tjibaou (and the rare European nationalists, such as Maurice Lenormand and Pierre Declercq). In 1979, the UC joined with the Party of Kanak Liberation (FLNKS) and other parties to form the Nationalist Front, which became the Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front (FLNKS) in 1984.\n\nThe UC was the largest faction in the FLNKS, led by Tjibaou. It was largely moderate, as opposed to the more radical Palika. Tjibaou was killed in 1989 by an extremist Kanak nationalist. In 2001, Roch Wamytan, the moderate leader of the UC, lost an election to Pascal Naouna, a radical. The UC has since broken with Palika within the FLNKS, which has no unitary president and is very divided. Charles Pidjot, Roch Pidjot's nephew, replaced Naouna in 2007. He died in 2012 and was then replaced himself by Daniel Goa\n\nIn the 2009 provincial elections, the party won 9 seats in the Congress of New Caledonia and around 11.65% of the vote. However, in the South Province, the UC ran on a common slate with Palika and won one of the four seats won by that list.\n\nThe UC controls the provincial presidency of the Loyalty Islands.\n\nThe UC favour the concept of independence-association similar to the Marshall Islands. However, the UC has taken a radical stance in favour of strict adherence to the terms of the Nouméa Accord, no talks with the loyalists. For example, the UC boycotted the visit of Jacques Chirac to the island in 2003.\n"}

In the 1999 elections, the new party obtained 4 seats in the Congress of New Caledonia and formed a common group with the anti-independence Rally for Caledonia in the Republic (RPCR). While still in favour of independence, it supports talks and co-operation between factions in the meantime and opposes the concept of ethnic nationalism and ethnic independence supported by the FLNKS. The FCCI's close affiliation with the RPCR has often made it the centre of criticism, mostly on its left, calling it a \"RPCR bis\".\n\nThe FCCI's co-operation with the RPCR led to its downfall in the 2004 election, where it won only one seat in Congress (from the Loyalty Islands). Its sole Congressman, Cono Hnaéjé Hamu, formed a common group with the RPCR but Hamu left to re-join the Caledonian Union.\n\nIn the latest legislative elections of May 10, 2009, it won 0.6% of the popular vote, and no seats in the Congress of New Caledonia.\n"}

The most radical members of Palika, which had been the base of the party since its creation, walked out criticizing the Palika's increasing moderation and increasing links with the metropolitan French Socialist Party (PS). Led by Nidoïsh Naisseline, a Marxist, it also refused to support Rock Pidjot of the Caledonian Union in the 1981 elections. However, the LKS moderated and it did not participate in the FLNKS-led electoral boycotts in the 1980s. In the 1990s, the party even started co-operating with the anti-independence Rally for Caledonia in the Republic (RPCR) in the Loyalty Islands. Thanks to this alliance, Nidoïsh Naisseline was president of the islands between 1995 and 1999. During this time, the LKS adopted a platform in favour of independence-association and started early negotiations with the loyalists while the FLNKS refused talks until a mining dispute in the North had been settled.

At the Quebec Conference in August 1943, it was merged with the American Manhattan Project. The British contribution to the Manhattan Project saw British scientists participate in most of its work. The British government considered nuclear weapons to be a joint discovery, but the American Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (McMahon Act) restricted other countries, including the UK, from access to information about nuclear weapons. Fearing the loss of Britain's great power status, the UK resumed its own project, now codenamed High Explosive Research. On 3 October 1952, it detonated an atomic bomb in the Monte Bello Islands of Western Australia in Operation Hurricane. Eleven more British nuclear weapons tests in Australia were carried out over the following decade, including seven British nuclear tests at Maralinga in 1956 and 1957.\n\nThe British hydrogen bomb programme demonstrated Britain's ability to produce thermonuclear weapons in the Operation Grapple nuclear tests in the Pacific, and led to the amendment of the McMahon Act. Since the 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement, the US and the UK have cooperated extensively on nuclear security matters. The nuclear Special Relationship between the two countries has involved the exchange of classified scientific data and fissile materials such as uranium-235 and plutonium. The UK has not had a programme to develop an independent delivery system since the cancellation of the Blue Streak in 1960. Instead, it has purchased US delivery systems for UK use, fitting them with warheads designed and manufactured by the UK's Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) and its predecessor. Under the 1963 Polaris Sales Agreement, the US supplied the UK with Polaris missiles and nuclear submarine technology. The US also supplied the RAF and British Army of the Rhine with nuclear weapons under Project E until 1992. Nuclear-capable American aircraft have been based in the UK since 1949, but the last US nuclear weapons were withdrawn in 2006.\n\nIn 1982, the Polaris Sales Agreement was amended to allow the UK to purchase Trident II missiles. Since 1998, when the UK decommissioned its tactical WE.177 bombs, the Trident has been the only operational nuclear weapons system in British service. The delivery system consists of four s based at HMNB Clyde in Scotland. Each submarine is armed with up to sixteen Trident II missiles, each carrying warheads in up to eight Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs). With at least one submarine always on patrol, the \"Vanguards\" perform a strategic deterrence role and also have a sub-strategic capability.\n\nThe neutron was discovered by James Chadwick at the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge in February 1932, and in April 1932, his Cavendish colleagues John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton split lithium atoms with accelerated protons. In December 1938, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann at Hahn's laboratory in Berlin-Dahlem bombarded uranium with slow neutrons, and discovered that barium had been produced. Hahn wrote to his colleague Lise Meitner, who, with her nephew Otto Frisch, determined that the uranium nucleus had been split, a conclusion they published in \"Nature\" in 1939. By analogy with the division of biological cells, they named the process \"fission\".\n\nThe discovery of fission raised the possibility that an extremely powerful atomic bomb could be created. The term was already familiar to the British public through the writings of H. G. Wells, with a continuously-exploding bomb in his 1913 novel \"The World Set Free\". George Paget Thomson, at Imperial College London, and Mark Oliphant, an Australian physicist at the University of Birmingham, were tasked with carrying out a series of experiments on uranium. Oliphant delegated the task to two German refugee scientists, Rudolf Peierls and Frisch, who ironically could not work on the university's secret projects like radar because they were enemy aliens and therefore lacked the necessary security clearance. In March 1940 they calculated the critical mass of a metallic sphere of pure uranium-235, and found that instead of tons, as everyone had assumed, as little as would suffice, which would explode with the power of thousands of tons of dynamite.\n\nOliphant took the resulting Frisch–Peierls memorandum to Sir Henry Tizard, the chairman of the Tizard Committee, and the MAUD Committee was established to investigate further. It directed an intensive research effort, and in July 1941, produced two comprehensive reports that reached the conclusion that an atomic bomb was not only technically feasible, but could be produced before the war ended, perhaps in as little as two years. The Committee unanimously recommended pursuing the development of an atomic bomb as a matter of urgency, although it recognised that the resources required might be beyond those available to Britain. A new directorate known as Tube Alloys was created to coordinate this effort. Sir John Anderson, the Lord President of the Council, became the minister responsible, and Wallace Akers from Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) was appointed the director of Tube Alloys.\n\nIn July 1940, Britain had offered to give the United States access to its scientific research, and the Tizard Mission's John Cockcroft briefed American scientists on British developments. He discovered that the American S-1 Project (later renamed the Manhattan Project) was smaller than the British, and not as far advanced. The British and American projects exchanged information, but did not initially combine their efforts. British officials did not reply to an August 1941 American offer to create a combined project. In November 1941, Frederick L. Hovde, the head of the London liaison office of the American Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), raised the issue of cooperation and exchange of information with Anderson and Lord Cherwell, who demurred, ostensibly over concerns about American security. Ironically, it was the British project that had already been penetrated by atomic spies for the Soviet Union.\nThe United Kingdom did not have the manpower or resources of the United States, and despite its early and promising start, Tube Alloys fell behind its American counterpart and was dwarfed by it. On 30 July 1942, Anderson advised the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, that: \"We must face the fact that ... [our] pioneering work ... is a dwindling asset and that, unless we capitalise it quickly, we shall be outstripped. We now have a real contribution to make to a 'merger.' Soon we shall have little or none.\"\n\nThe British considered producing an atomic bomb without American help, but it would require overwhelming priority, disruption to other wartime projects was inevitable, and it was unlikely to be ready in time to affect the outcome of the war in Europe. The unanimous response was that before embarking on this, another effort should be made to secure American cooperation. At the Quebec Conference in August 1943, Churchill and the President of the United States, Franklin Roosevelt, signed the Quebec Agreement, which merged the two national projects. The Quebec Agreement established the Combined Policy Committee and the Combined Development Trust to coordinate their efforts, and specified that the weapons could only be used if both the USA and UK governments agreed. The 19 September 1944 Hyde Park Agreement extended both commercial and military cooperation into the post-war period.\n\nA British mission led by Akers assisted in the development of gaseous diffusion technology at the SAM Laboratories in New York. Another, led by Oliphant, who acted as deputy director at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory, assisted with the electromagnetic separation process. Cockcroft became the director of the Anglo-Canadian Montreal Laboratory. The British mission to the Los Alamos Laboratory was headed by Chadwick, and later Peierls. It included distinguished scientists such as Geoffrey Taylor, James Tuck, Niels Bohr, William Penney, Frisch, Ernest Titterton and Klaus Fuchs, who was later revealed to be a Soviet spy. As overall head of the British Mission, Chadwick forged a close and successful partnership with Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, the director of the Manhattan Project. He ensured that British participation was complete and wholehearted.\n\nPenney worked on means to assess the effects of a nuclear explosion, and wrote a paper on what height the bombs should be detonated at for maximum effect in attacks on Germany and Japan. He served as a member of the target committee established by Groves to select Japanese cities for atomic bombing, and on Tinian with Project Alberta as a special consultant. Because the Quebec Agreement specified that nuclear weapons would not be used against another country without mutual consent, British authorisation was required for their use. On 4 July 1945, Field Marshal Henry Maitland Wilson agreed that the use of nuclear weapons against Japan would be recorded as a decision of the Combined Policy Committee. Along with Group Captain Leonard Cheshire, sent by Wilson as a British representative, Penney watched the bombing of Nagasaki from the observation plane \"Big Stink\". He also formed part of the Manhattan Project's post-war scientific mission to Hiroshima and Nagasaki that assessed the extent of the damage caused by the bombs.\n\nWith the end of the war, the Special Relationship between Britain and the United States \"became very much less special\". The British government had trusted that America would share nuclear technology, which it considered a joint discovery. On 8 August 1945 the Prime Minister, Clement Attlee, sent a message to President Harry Truman in which he referred to themselves as \"heads of the Governments which have control of this great force\". But Roosevelt had died on 12 April 1945, and the Hyde Park Agreement was not binding on subsequent administrations. In fact, it was physically lost. When Wilson raised the matter in a Combined Policy Committee meeting in June, the American copy could not be found.\n\nOn 9 November 1945, Attlee and the Prime Minister of Canada, Mackenzie King, went to Washington, D.C., to confer with Truman about future cooperation in nuclear weapons and nuclear power. A Memorandum of Intention they signed replaced the Quebec Agreement. It made Canada a full partner, continued the Combined Policy Committee and Combined Development Trust, and reduced the obligation to obtain consent for the use of nuclear weapons to merely requiring consultation. The three leaders agreed that there would be full and effective cooperation on atomic energy, but British hopes were soon disappointed; the Americans restricted cooperation to basic scientific research.\n\nThe next meeting of the Combined Policy Committee on 15 April 1946 produced no accord on collaboration, and resulted in an exchange of cables between Truman and Attlee. Truman cabled on 20 April that he did not see the communiqué he had signed as obligating the United States to assist Britain in designing, constructing and operating an atomic energy plant. The passing of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (McMahon Act) in August 1946, which was signed by Truman on 1 August 1946, and went into effect at midnight on 1 January 1947, ended technical cooperation. Its control of \"restricted data\" prevented the United States' allies from receiving any information. The remaining British scientists working in the United States were denied access to papers that they had written just days before.\n\nThis partly resulted from the arrest for espionage of British physicist Alan Nunn May, who had worked in the Montreal Laboratory, in February 1946, while the legislation was being debated. It was but the first of a series of spy scandals. The arrest of Klaus Fuchs in January 1950, and the June 1951 defection of Donald Maclean, who had served as a British member of the Combined Policy Committee from January 1947 to August 1948, left Americans with a distrust of British security arrangements.\n\nAttlee set up a cabinet sub-committee, the Gen 75 Committee (known informally by Attlee as the \"Atomic Bomb Committee\"), on 10 August 1945 to examine the feasibility of an independent British nuclear weapons programme. The Chiefs of Staff Committee considered the issue of nuclear weapons in July 1946, and recommended that Britain acquire them. The Chief of the Air Staff, Marshal of the Royal Air Force Lord Tedder, officially requested an atomic bomb in 9 August 1946. The Chiefs of Staff estimated that 200 bombs would be required by 1957. A nuclear reactor and plutonium-processing facility was approved by the Gen 75 committee on 18 December 1945 \"with the highest urgency and importance\".\nThe Tube Alloys Directorate was transferred from the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research to the Ministry of Supply effective 1 November 1945. To coordinate the atomic energy effort, Marshal of the Royal Air Force Lord Portal, the wartime Chief of the Air Staff, was appointed the Controller of Production, Atomic Energy (CPAE) in March 1946. The Gen 75 Committee considered the proposal in October 1946. In October 1946, Attlee called a meeting to discuss building a gaseous diffusion plant for uranium enrichment. Michael Perrin, who was present, later recalled that:\n\nThe decision to proceed was formally made on 8 January 1947 at a meeting of Gen 163, a subcommittee of the Gen 75 Committee consisting of six Cabinet members, including Attlee, and was publicly announced in the House of Commons on 12 May 1948. D notice No. 25 prohibited the publication of details on the design, construction or location of atomic weapons. The project was given the cover name \"High Explosive Research\". As Chief Superintendent Armament Research (CSAR, pronounced \"Caesar\"), Penney directed bomb design from Fort Halstead. In 1951 his design group moved to a new site at Aldermaston in Berkshire.\n\nProduction facilities were constructed under the direction of Christopher Hinton, who established his headquarters in a former Royal Ordnance Factory (ROF) at ROF Risley in Lancashire. These included a uranium metal plant at Springfields, nuclear reactors and a plutonium processing plant at Windscale, and a gaseous diffusion uranium enrichment facility at Capenhurst, near Chester. The two Windscale reactors became operational in October 1950 and June 1951. The gaseous diffusion plant at Capenhurst began producing highly enriched uranium in 1954.\n\nUranium ore was stockpiled at Springfields. As the American nuclear programme expanded, its requirements became greater than the production of the existing mines. To gain access to the stockpile, they reopened negotiations in 1947. This resulted in the 1948 \"Modus Vivendi\", which allowed for consultation on the use of nuclear weapons, and limited sharing of technical information between the United States, Britain and Canada.\n\nBy 1949, international control of atomic weapons seemed almost impossible to achieve, and Truman proposed to the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy in July a \"full partnership\" with Britain in exchange for uranium; negotiations between the two countries began that month. While the first Soviet atomic bomb test in August 1949 was embarrassing to the British (who had not expected a Soviet atomic weapon until 1954) for having been beaten, it was for the Americans another reason for cooperation. Although they would soon have their own nuclear capability, the British proposed that instead of building their own uranium-enrichment plant they would send most of their scientists to work in the US, and swap plutonium from Windscale for enriched uranium from the US. While Britain would not formally give up building or researching its own weapons, the US would manufacture all the bombs and allocate some to Britain.\n\nBy agreeing to subsume its own weapons programme within the Americans', the plan would have given Britain nuclear weapons much sooner than its own target date of late 1952. Although a majority of Americans including Truman supported the proposal, several key officials, including the United States Atomic Energy Commission's Lewis Strauss and Senator Arthur Vandenberg, did not. Their opposition, along with security concerns raised by the arrest of Fuchs, who was working at Harwell, ended the negotiations in January 1950. After Britain developed nuclear weapons through its own efforts, the engineer Sir Leonard Owen stated that \"the McMahon Act was probably one of the best things that happened ... as it made us work and think for ourselves along independent lines.\"\n\nChurchill, now again prime minister, announced on 17 February 1952 that the first British weapon test would occur before the end of the year. During Operation Hurricane, an atomic bomb was detonated on board the frigate anchored in a lagoon in the Monte Bello Islands in Western Australia on 3 October 1952. Britain thereby became the third country to develop and test nuclear weapons.\nThis led to the development of the first deployed weapon, the Blue Danube free-fall bomb. It had a diameter, 32 explosive lens implosion system with a levitated pit suspended within a natural uranium tamper. The warhead was contained within a bomb casing measuring diameter and long, and it weighed approximately , of which about was high explosive. The first Blue Danube bombs were delivered to the Royal Air Force (RAF) Bomber Command in November 1953, although the bombers to deliver them did not become available until 1955.\n\nAbout fifty-eight Blue Danube bombs were produced. The first bombs had plutonium cores, but all service models were modified to use a composite core which used both uranium-235 and plutonium. The bomb had a yield of . The cores were stored separately from the high explosive components in concrete \"igloos\" at RAF Barnham in Suffolk and RAF Faldingworth in Lincolnshire. Some casings were stored elsewhere in the UK and in Cyprus for \"second strike\" use. It remained in service until 1962, and was replaced by Red Beard, a smaller tactical nuclear weapon. The Blue Danube cores were recycled, and the plutonium used in other nuclear weapons.\n\nBeing so big and heavy, Blue Danube could only be carried by the V bombers, so-called because they all had names starting with a \"V\". The three strategic bombers, known collectively as the V class, comprised the United Kingdom's strategic nuclear strike force during the 1950s and 1960s, which was known as V force of the Main Force. The three V bombers were the Vickers Valiant, which entered service in February 1955; the Avro Vulcan, which entered service in May 1956; and the Handley Page Victor, which entered service in November 1957. The V Bomber force reached its peak in June 1964, when 50 Valiants, 70 Vulcans and 39 Victors were in service.\n\nA month after Britain's first atomic weapons test, America tested the first thermonuclear (hydrogen) bomb. The Soviets responded with Joe 4, a boosted fission weapon, in 1953. Penney believed that Britain could not afford to develop a hydrogen bomb. Henry Tizard believed that the nation should focus on conventional forces instead of duplicating the nuclear capabilities of the American forces that were already defending Britain and Europe: \"We are a great nation, but if we continue to behave like a Great Power we shall soon cease to be a great nation. Let us take warning from the fate of the Great Powers of the past and not burst ourselves with pride.\"\n\nThe First Sea Lord, Admiral Lord Mountbatten, and Chief of the Imperial General Staff, General Sir Gerald Templer supported the development of a hydrogen bomb, but preferred more support for conventional forces. They believed that the large American and Soviet nuclear forces acted as mutual deterrents for nuclear war, making conventional war more likely. Others proposed that, instead of repeated unsuccessful attempts to increase cooperation with the Americans, Britain work with Australia, Canada, and other Commonwealth countries. Britain could not disclose atomic information to Australia despite testing weapons there because of agreements with the United States.\n\nThe Chiefs of Staff Committee and the Churchill ministry, however, believed that\nThe government decided on 27 July 1954 to begin development of a thermonuclear bomb, and announced its plans in February 1955. British knowledge of thermonuclear weapons was based on the work done at the Los Alamos Laboratory during the war. Two British scientists, Egon Bretscher and Klaus Fuchs, had attended the conference there on the Super (as it was then called) in April 1946, and Chadwick had written a secret report on it in May 1946, but the design was found to be unworkable. Some intelligence about Joe 4 was derived from its debris, which was provided to Britain under the 1948 \"Modus Vivendi\". Penney established three megaton bomb projects at Aldermaston: Orange Herald, a large boosted fission weapon; Green Bamboo, an interim thermonuclear design similar to the Soviet Layer Cake used in Joe 4 and the American Alarm Clock; and Green Granite, a true thermonuclear design.\n\nThe Green Granite prototype, known as Short Granite, was tested in the first of the Operation Grapple test series, Grapple 1. The bomb was dropped from a height of by a Vickers Valiant piloted by Wing Commander Kenneth Hubbard, off the shore of Malden Island in the Pacific on 15 May 1957. It was Britain's second airdrop of a nuclear bomb after the Operation Buffalo test at Maralinga on 11 October 1956, and the first of a thermonuclear weapon. The United States had not attempted an airdrop of a hydrogen bomb until the Operation Redwing Cherokee test on 21 May 1956. Short Granite's yield was estimated at , far below its designed capability. Despite its failure, the test was hailed as a successful thermonuclear explosion, and the government did not confirm or deny reports that the UK had become a third thermonuclear power. When documents on the series began to be declassified in the 1990s, they were denounced as a hoax. The reports were unlikely to have fooled the American observers.\n\nThe next test was Grapple 2, of Orange Herald, the first British weapon to incorporate an external neutron initiator. It was dropped on 31 May, and exploded with a force of . The yield was the largest ever achieved by a single stage device, which made it technically a megaton weapon. The bomb was hailed as a hydrogen bomb, and the truth that it was actually a large fission bomb was kept secret by the British government until the end of the Cold War. Penney cancelled the planned Green Granite test, and substituted Purple Granite, a Short Granite with some minor modifications. Its yield was a very disappointing , even less than Short Granite; the changes had not worked.\n\nAn Operational Requirement (OR1142) was issued in 1955 for a thermonuclear warhead for a medium-range ballistic missile, which became Blue Streak. This was revised in November 1955, with \"megaton\" replacing \"thermonuclear\". Orange Herald could then meet the requirement. Codenamed Green Grass, the unsuccessful fusion boosting was omitted, and it used Green Bamboo's 72-lens implosion system instead of Orange Herald's 32. This allowed the amount of highly enriched uranium to be reduced from 120 to 75 kg. Its yield was estimated at . It was placed in a Blue Danube casing, and became known as Violet Club. Road transport of the weapon was hazardous. As a safety measure 120,000 steel ball bearings were used to fill a cavity inside the core and keep the fissile components apart. In an accident, the steel bung was removed and the ball bearings spilled on the floor of an aircraft hangar, leaving the bomb armed and dangerous. About ten were delivered.\nThe scientists at Aldermaston had not yet mastered the design of thermonuclear weapons. They produced a new design, called Round A. Another trial was scheduled, known as Grapple X. Round A was dropped on 8 November 1957. To save time and money, the target was off the southern tip of Christmas Island rather than off Malden Island, just from the airfield where 3,000 men were based. This time the yield of exceeded expectations. Round A was a true hydrogen bomb, but it used a relatively large quantity of expensive highly enriched uranium.\n\nAldermaston had plenty of ideas about how to follow up Grapple X. A new design used lithium deuteride that was less enriched in lithium-6 (and therefore had more lithium-7), but more of it, thereby reducing the amount of uranium-235 in the core. Because of the possibility of an international moratorium on atmospheric testing, plans for the trial, codenamed Grapple Y, were given verbal approval by the Prime Minister, and known only to a handful of officials. The bomb was dropped off Christmas on 28 April 1958. It had an explosive yield of about , and remains the largest British nuclear weapon ever tested. The design of Grapple Y was notably successful because much of its yield came from its thermonuclear reaction instead of fission of a uranium-238 tamper, making it a true hydrogen bomb, and because its yield had been correctly predicted—indicating that its designers understood what they were doing.\n\nOn 22 August 1958, US President Dwight D. Eisenhower announced a moratorium on nuclear testing. This did not mean an immediate end to testing; on the contrary, the United States, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom all rushed to perform as much testing as possible before the deadline. A new British test series, known as Grapple Z, commenced on 22 August. It explored new technologies such as the use of external neutron initiators, which had first been tried out with Orange Herald. Core boosting using tritium and external boosting with layers of lithium deuteride were successfully tested, allowing a smaller, lighter two-stage devices. The international moratorium commenced on 31 October 1958, and Britain ceased atmospheric testing for good.\n\nBelieving that the United Kingdom was extremely vulnerable to a nuclear attack to which defence was impossible, the Chiefs of Staff and the RAF first advocated a British nuclear deterrence—not just nuclear weapons—in 1945: \"It is our opinion that our only chance of securing a quick decision is by launching a devastating attack upon [enemy cities] with absolute weapons.\" In 1947 the Chiefs of Staff stated that even with American help the United Kingdom could not prevent the \"vastly superior\" Soviet forces from overrunning Western Europe, from which Russia could destroy Britain with missiles without using atomic weapons. Only \"the threat of large-scale damage from similar weapons\" could prevent the Soviet Union from using atomic weapons in a war.\n\nAir Chief Marshal Sir John Slessor, who became Chief of the Air Staff in 1950, wrote that year that the Soviet superiority in European forces was so great that even \"an ultimatum by Russia within the next two to three years\" might cause Western Europe to surrender without a war. He feared that the United Kingdom might also do so \"unless we can make ourselves far less defenceless than we are now.\" By 1952 the Air Ministry had abandoned the concept of a conventional defence of Western Europe. The hydrogen bomb increased the threat to Britain. In 1957, a government study stated that although RAF fighters would \"unquestionably be able to take a heavy toll of enemy bombers, a proportion would inevitably get through. Even if it were only a dozen, they could with megaton bombs inflict widespread devastation.\" Although disarmament remained a British goal, \"the only existing safeguard against major aggression is the power to threaten retaliation with nuclear weapons.\"\n\nChurchill stated in a 1955 speech that deterrence would be \"the parents of disarmament\" and that, unless Britain contributed to Western deterrence with its own weapons, during a war the targets that threatened it the most might not be prioritised. The Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan, advanced the position that nuclear weapons would give Britain influence over targeting and American policy, and would affect strategy in the Middle East and Far East. His Minister of Defence, Duncan Sandys, considered that nuclear weapons reduced Britain's dependence on the United States. The 1956 Suez Crisis demonstrated that Britain was no longer a great power, but increased the value to Britain of an independent nuclear deterrent that would give it greater influence with the US and USSR. While the military target of British nuclear weapons was the Soviet Union, the political target was the United States.\n\nIndependent targeting was vital. The Chiefs of Staff believed that—contrary to Tizard's view—once the Soviet Union became able to attack the United States itself with nuclear weapons in the late 1950s, America might not risk its own cities to defend Europe, or not emphasise targets that endangered the United Kingdom more than the United States:\nBritain thus needed the ability to convince the USSR that attacking Europe would be too costly regardless of American participation. Part of the perceived effectiveness of an independent deterrent was the willingness to target enemy cities. Slessor saw atomic weapons as a way to avoid a third devastating world war given that the two previous ones had begun without them. While he sought to de-emphasise city targeting in British plans as Air Chief, Slessor wrote in 1954 after retirement:\n\nWhen Air Marshal Sir George Mills became head of RAF Bomber Command in 1955 he similarly insisted on targeting Soviet cities, writing \"Whoever would be afraid of launching a sudden attack if he thought the greater part of our retaliation would come back to his airfields?\" The belief in the importance of retaining an independent capability has continued over several decades and changes in government. As the Defence Council stated in 1980:\nWhen France developed its own nuclear weapons, British politicians contended that Europe required an independent deterrent other than that of France.\n\nThe Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik 1, the world's first artificial satellite, on 4 October 1957, came as a tremendous shock to the American public, who had trusted that American technological superiority ensured their invulnerability. Now, suddenly, there was incontrovertible proof that, in some areas at least, the Soviet Union was actually ahead. In the widespread calls for action in response to the Sputnik crisis, officials in the United States and Britain seized an opportunity to mend the relationship with Britain that had been damaged by the Suez Crisis. Macmillan wrote to Eisenhower on 10 October urging that the two countries pool their resources to meet the challenge.\n\nBritish information security, or the lack thereof, no longer seemed so important now that the Soviet Union was apparently ahead, and British scientists had demonstrated that they understood how to build a hydrogen bomb with a different form of the Teller-Ulam design to the Americans. The opposition that had derailed previous attempts was now absent. The McMahon Act was amended, paving the way for the 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement (MDA). Macmillan called this \"the Great Prize\".\n\nUnder the MDA, 5.37 tonnes of UK-produced plutonium was sent to the US in exchange for 6.7 kg of tritium and 7.5 tonnes of HEU between 1960 and 1979. A further 470 kg of plutonium was swapped between the US and the UK for reasons that remain classified. Much of the HEU supplied by the US was used not for weapons, but as fuel for the growing fleet of UK nuclear submarines. Under the MDA, the US supplied the UK with not just nuclear submarine propulsion technology, but a complete S5W pressurised water reactor of the kind used to power the US submarines. This was used in the Royal Navy's first nuclear-powered submarine, , which was launched in 1960 and commissioned in 1963. The S5W had a Nuclear reactor core that used uranium enriched to between 93 and 97 per cent uranium-235. Reactor technology was transferred from Westinghouse to Rolls Royce, which used it as the basis for its PWR1 reactor used in the UK's nuclear submarines.\n\nThe MDA has been renewed or amended many times. Most amendments merely extended the treaty for another five or ten years; others added definitions and made minor changes. , the most recent renewal was on 22 July 2014, extending the treaty to 31 December 2024. A 1974 US proliferation report discussing British nuclear and missile development noted that \"In many cases, it is based on technology received from the US and could not legitimately be passed on without US permission.\"\n\nProduction of British nuclear weapons was slow and Britain had only ten atomic bombs on hand in 1955 and just fourteen in 1956. At the three-power Bermuda Conference with Eisenhower in December 1953, Churchill, suggested that the United States allow Britain to have access to American nuclear weapons to make up the shortfall. The provision on American weapons was called Project E. The agreement was confirmed by Eisenhower and Macmillan, who was now the Prime Minister, during their March 1957 meeting in Bermuda, and a formal Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed on 21 May 1957.\n\nFour squadrons of English Electric Canberra bombers based in Germany were equipped with US Mark 7 nuclear bombs stored at RAF Germany bases. There were also four squadrons of nuclear-armed Canberras based in the UK, which were capable of carrying either the Mark 7 or Red Beard. They too were assigned to the SACEUR in October 1960. The planned V-bomber force was reduced to 144 aircraft, and it was intended to equip half of them with Project E weapons, so 72 Mark 5 nuclear bombs were supplied for the V-bombers. When the MDA came into force, the US agreed to supply the V-bombers with megaton weapons in place of the Mark 5, in the form of Mark 15 and Mark 39 nuclear bombs.\n\nUnder the Project E MOU, US personnel had custody of the weapons. This meant they performed all the tasks related to their storage, maintenance and readiness. The bombs were stored in Secure Storage Areas (SSAs) on the same bases as the bombers which British staff were not permitted to enter. It was therefore impossible to store British and Americans bombs together in the same SSA. US custody also created operational problems. The procedure for handing over the bombs added an extra ten minutes to the bombers' reaction time, and the requirement that US personnel had guardianship of the weapons at all times meant that neither they nor the bombers could be relocated to dispersal airfields as the RAF desired. The operational restrictions imposed by Project E \"effectively handed the US government a veto over the use of half of Britain's nuclear deterrent\".\n\nThe Air Council decided on 7 July 1960 that Project E weapons would be phased out by December 1962, by which time it was anticipated that there would be sufficient British megaton weapons to equip the entire strategic bomber force. Project E weapons were replaced by British Yellow Sun bombs. Problems encountered in the development Red Beard bomb meant that the replacement of kiloton weapons took longer. The Air Ministry decided to replace the Canberras with Valiants as the long-range Vulcan and Victor V bombers became available. A Valiant squadron at RAF Marham was assigned to SACEUR on 1 January 1961, followed by two more in July. The UK-based Canberra squadrons were then disbanded. Each of the 24 Valiants was equipped with two Project E Mark 28 nuclear bombs. These were replaced by the newer Mark 43 nuclear bombs in early 1963. The Valiants were withdrawn from service in 1965.\n\nProject E nuclear warheads were also used on the sixty Thor Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles (IRBMs) that were operated by the RAF from 1959 to 1963 under Project Emily. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, the RAF's bombers and Thor missiles targeted 16 cities, 44 airfields, 10 air defence control centres and 20 IRBM sites. The RAF high command never warmed to missiles, and always ranked them secondary to the V bomber force. The missile bases were separate from the rest of the RAF and its personnel considered outside the mainstream. Project Emily gave the RAF considerable experience in missile operations, but the 1960 cancellation Blue Streak in favour of the American Skybolt, an air-launched ballistic missile, rendered this expertise of dubious value. An Air Council meeting on 31 May 1962 decided that Project Emily should be terminated by the end of 1963, and the last Thor squadrons were inactivated on 23 August 1963.\nThe availability of US weapons and designs under the MDA led to the cancellation of several research projects. Indigo Hammer and the smaller Pixie were warheads intended for use with the Red Duster and Seaslug surface-to-air missiles; a British version of the US W44 was chosen instead. Blue Peacock, a atomic demolition munition (ADMs) based on Blue Danube, was cancelled in 1958 in favour of the lighter Violet Mist, based on Red Beard. The development of the even smaller and lighter US ADMs led to its cancellation as well in 1961. The US Medium Atomic Demolition Munition with the W45 was acquired instead. Yellow Anvil was a British artillery warhead. It was cancelled in 1958, and the US supplied the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) with 36 W33 nuclear warheads that equipped four batteries of eight-inch M115 howitzers. These were later replaced by M110 howitzers.\n\nThe British Army purchased 113 Corporal missiles from the United States in 1954. It was intended that they would be equipped with British warheads under a project codenamed Violet Vision, but Project E offered a quicker, simpler and cheaper alternative. The US supplied 100 W7 warheads, which had to be drawn from US Army storage sites in southern Germany until arrangements were made for local storage in August 1959. A British missile, Blue Water, with an Indigo Hammer warhead, was developed to replace Corporal. The US offered the Honest John missile as an interim replacement. The offer was accepted, and 120 Honest John missiles with W31 warheads were supplied in 1960, enough to equip three artillery regiments. Blue Water was cancelled in July 1962, and Honest John remained in service until 1977, when it was replaced by the Lance missile. The British Army deployed more US nuclear weapons than the RAF and Royal Navy combined, peaking at 327 out of 392 in 1976–1978.\n\nA maritime version of Project E, known as Project N supplied US Navy weapons. Providing American atomic bombs for Royal Navy ships would have involved similar dual key arrangements and detachments of US Marines on board Royal Navy ships, which was deemed impractical even for ships and weapons dedicated to use in European waters. However, RAF Coastal Command acquired Mk 101 Lulu nuclear depth bombs (with the W34 nuclear warhead) for its Avro Shackleton and Hawker Siddeley Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft from 1965 to 1971 under Project N. These were later replaced by the more capable Mark 57, which was stockpiled at RAF St Mawgan and RAF Machrihanish.\n\nWhen the Cold War ended in 1991, the BAOR still had about 85 Lance missiles, and more than 70 W33 eight-inch and W48 155 mm nuclear artillery shells. The last Project E warheads, including the Mark 57 nuclear depth bombs and those used by the BAOR, were withdrawn in July 1992.\n\nThe MDA made fully developed and tested American designs available quickly and cheaply. The first of these was the Mark 28, which was \"Anglicised\" and manufactured in the UK as Red Snow. Exact copies of American designs were not pursued; the high explosive used in American warheads were more sensitive than British high explosive, and had caused fatal accidents in the US. Its use was not contemplated in the UK after an accident at Aldermaston on 28 February 1959 when two men were killed after a piece of British high explosive fell from a lorry. British high explosive was also bulkier, so a redesign was required.\n\nRed Snow was far more economical in its use of fissile material than the Green Grass warhead in the Yellow Sun Mk.1 bomb, Britain's first production hydrogen bomb. A Yellow Sun Mk.2 with Red Snow, therefore, cost £500,000 compared to £1.2 million for the Mk.1. RAF Bomber Command wanted Violet Club replaced as soon as possible, so 37 Yellow Sun Mk.1s were delivered by the end of 1959. Deliveries of the Yellow Sun Mk.2 commenced in January 1961, and 43 were delivered by the end of the year. In November 1958. Red Snow also replaced Green Grass as the warhead in the Blue Steel stand-off missile.\n\nThe kiloton Red Beard, was developed for use by the Canberras and the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm. Technical problems delayed its introduction into service, but over 100 were delivered by the end of 1961. Up to 48 Red Beards were secretly stowed in a highly secured weapons storage facility at RAF Tengah in Singapore between 1962 and 1971 for possible use V bombers and for Britain's military commitment to SEATO.\n\nIn 1960 the government decided to cancel the Blue Streak missile based on the Chiefs of Staff's conclusion that it was too vulnerable to attack and thus was only useful for a first strike, and decided to purchase the American air-launched Skybolt missile instead. Macmillan met with Eisenhower in March 1960, and secured permission to buy Skybolt without strings attached. In return, the Americans were given permission to base the US Navy's Polaris-equipped ballistic missile submarines at Holy Loch in Scotland.\n\nThe Americans initially intended to pair Skybolt with the W47 warhead, an innovative light-weight design from the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory developed for Polaris. The British wanted to use Red Snow, partly for safety reasons and partly because it was not certain that the advanced M47 design would be made available without strings attached. The technical problem was that Red Snow was heavier, and therefore the range of the Skybolt would be reduced from . A megaton design known as RE.179 based on the W49 warhead used in American ICBMs was developed for Skybolt.\n\nAt the same time, work was in progress on a Red Beard replacement for use with the RAF's BAC TSR-2 and the Royal Navy's Blackburn Buccaneer. Ultimately, a warhead was produced in two variants: the high-yield () WE.177B and the low-yield () WE.177A as a Red Beard replacement, and for use in depth charges and anti-submarine missiles. WE.177 was later adapted for use with Polaris, and would become the longest-serving British nuclear weapon.\n\nThe deployment of ships carrying nuclear weapons caused complications during the Falklands War, and in the aftermath of that war it was decided to stockpile them ashore in peacetime. When the US withdrew its theatre nuclear weapons from Europe, the British government followed suit. The nuclear depth bombs were withdrawn from service in 1992, followed by the WE.177 free-fall bombs on 31 March 1998, and all were dismantled by the end of August.\n\nThe Kennedy administration cancelled Skybolt in December 1962 because the United States Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, determined that other delivery systems were progressing better than expected, and a further expensive system was surplus to US requirements. In London, over one hundred Conservative members of Parliament, nearly one third of the parliamentary party, signed a motion urging Macmillan to ensure that Britain remained an independent nuclear power.\nMacmillan met with President John F. Kennedy and brokered the Nassau Agreement. Macmillan rejected offers of other systems, and insisted that the UK needed to purchase Polaris submarine-launched ballistic missiles. These represented more advanced technology than Skybolt, and the US was not inclined to provide them except as part of a Multilateral Force within the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). In the end, Kennedy did not wish to see Macmillan's government collapse, which would imperil Britain's entry into the European Economic Community (EEC), so a face-saving compromise was reached: the US agreed to provide the UK with Polaris missiles, which would be assigned to NATO, and could be used independently only when \"supreme national interests\" intervened.\n\nThe Polaris Sales Agreement was signed on 6 April 1963. The UK retained its deterrent force, although its control passed from the RAF to the Royal Navy. The Polaris missiles were equipped with British warheads. A base was developed for the Polaris submarines at Faslane on the Firth of Clyde, not far from the US Navy's base at Holy Loch. It was served by a weapons store at nearby Coulport. The first of four Polaris submarines, was launched in September 1966, and commenced its first deterrent patrol in June 1968. The annual running costs of the Polaris boats came to around two per cent of the defence budget, and they came to be seen as a credible deterrent that enhanced Britain's international status. British politicians did not like to talk about \"dependence\" on the United States, preferring to describe the Special Relationship as one of \"interdependence\".\n\nPolaris had not been designed to penetrate ABM defences, but the Royal Navy had to ensure that its small Polaris force operating alone, and often with only one submarine on patrol, could penetrate the ABM screen around Moscow. The Wilson government publicly ruled out the purchase of Poseidon missiles in June 1967, and without such a commitment, the Americans were unwilling to share information about warhead vulnerability. The result was Chevaline, an Improved Front End (IFE) that replaced one of the three warheads with multiple decoys and other defensive countermeasures. in what was known as a Penetration Aid Carrier (PAC). It was the most technically complex defence project ever undertaken in the United Kingdom. Chevaline's existence, along with its formerly secret codename, was revealed by the Secretary of State for Defence, Francis Pym, during a debate in the House of Commons on 24 January 1980. By this time the project had gone on for a decade. The final cost reached £1,025 million.\n\nIn 1982, the Thatcher government announced its decision to purchase 65 American Trident II D-5 missiles. These operated as part of a shared pool of weapons based at Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay in the United States. The US would maintain and support the missiles, while the UK would manufacture its own submarines and warheads. The warheads and missiles would be mated in the UK. Four s were designed and built.\nEach submarine could carry up to 16 missiles, each of which can each carry up to 8 warheads. However, when the decision to purchase Trident II was announced, it was stressed that British Trident boats would carry no more than 128 warheads—the same number as Polaris. In November 1993, the Secretary of State for Defence, Malcolm Rifkind, announced that each boat would deploy no more than 96 warheads. In 2010 this was reduced to a maximum of 40 warheads, split between eight missiles. The missiles have a range of .\n\nThe first Trident boat, , collected a full load of 16 missiles in 1994, but the second, drew only 12 in 1995, and the third, , 14 in 1997, leaving the remaining missile tubes empty. Although the UK designed, manufactured and owns the warheads, there is evidence that the warhead design is similar to, or even based on, the US W76 warhead fitted in some US Navy Trident missiles, with design data being supplied by the United States through the MDA.\n\nSince 1969 the United Kingdom has always had at least one ballistic-missile submarine on patrol, giving it a nuclear deterrent that is, what the Defence Council described in 1980 as, \"effectively invulnerable to pre-emptive attack\". In the Strategic Defence Review published in July 1998, the government stated that once the \"Vanguard\" submarines became fully operational (the fourth and final one, , entered service on 27 November 1999), it would \"maintain a stockpile of fewer than 200 operationally available warheads\". , the UK had a stockpile of 215 warheads, of which 120 were operational. The 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review reduced the number of warheads and missiles for the ballistic missile submarine on patrol to 40 and 8 respectively.\n\nThe current Trident system cost £12.6 billion to build (at 1996 prices) and £280m a year to maintain. Options for replacing Trident range from £5 billion for the missiles alone to £20–30 billion for missiles, submarines and research facilities. At minimum, for the system to continue after around 2020, the missiles will need to be replaced. The price of replacement of submarine has risen to £31 billion and it is estimated by Ministry of Defence that the cost of Trident replacement programme for 30 years to be at £167 billion.\n\nWith the tactical nuclear weapons having been withdrawn from service, Trident was the UK's only remaining nuclear weapons system. By this time, possession of nuclear weapons had become an important part of Britain's national identity. Not renewing Trident meant that Britain would become an non-nuclear power. It would spell the end of the Special Relationship with the United States, and strike at Britain's self-image as a great power. A decision on the renewal of Trident was made on 4 December 2006. Prime Minister Tony Blair told MPs it would be \"unwise and dangerous\" for the UK to give up its nuclear weapons. He outlined plans to spend up to £20bn on a new generation of ballistic missile submarines. The new boats would continue to carry the Trident II D-5 missiles, but submarine numbers might be cut from four to three, and the number of nuclear warheads would be cut by 20% to 160. He said although the Cold War had ended, the UK needed nuclear weapons, as no-one could be sure another nuclear threat would not emerge in the future.\n\nThe 2010 coalition government agreed \"that the renewal of Trident should be scrutinised to ensure value for money. Liberal Democrats will continue to make the case for alternatives.\" Research and development work continued, but the final decision to proceed with building a replacement was scheduled for 2016, after the next election. There was already some urgency to move ahead because some experts predicted it could take 17 years to develop the replacement for the \"Vanguard\"-class submarines.\n\nThe vote in the House of Commons on whether to replace the existing four \"Vanguard\"-class submarines was held on 18 July 2016. The Trident renewal programme motion passed with a significant majority with 472 MPs voting in favour and 117 against. The Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, and 47 other Labour MPs had voted against it; 41 did not vote but 140 Labour votes were cast in favour of the motion. The four new s were expected to come into operation in the early 2030s, with the programme lasting until at least the 2060s.On 25 February 2020, the UK released a Written Statement outlining that the current UK nuclear warheads will be replaced and will match the US Trident SLBM and related systems. Earlier, it was reported that Commander US Strategic Command, Admiral Charles Richard, mentioned in a Senate hearing that the UK was already working to replace its warheads, matching the future US Mk7 or W93 warhead.\n\nThe UK's first nuclear test, Operation Hurricane, was in the Montebello Islands of Western Australia. It was followed by the first nuclear tests on the Australian mainland, which were conducted at Emu Field in the Great Victoria Desert in South Australia as part of Operation Totem on 14 and 26 October 1953. Two further tests were held on the Montebello Islands as part of Operation Mosaic on 6 May and 19 June 1956. In the 1980s there emerged a claim that the second Mosaic test was of a significantly higher explosive yield than suggested by available figures— as compared to the official figure of —but this claim does not stand up to scrutiny.\nThe British government formally requested a permanent test facility on 30 October 1953. Due to concerns about nuclear fallout from the previous tests at Emu Field and the site's inadequate infrastructure and water supply, the recently surveyed site at Maralinga in South Australia was selected for this purpose. The new site was announced in May 1955. It was developed as a joint, co-funded facility between the British and Australian governments. Seven British nuclear tests at Maralinga were conducted between 27 September 1956 and 9 October 1957.\n\nIn addition to the major tests involving explosions, many subcritical minor trials were also carried out between June 1955 and April 1963. While the major tests had been carried out with some publicity, the minor tests were carried out in absolute secrecy. The \"Kitten\" tests tested bomb components, while \"Tims\" and \"Rats\" were early subcritical hydronuclear tests. The \"Vixen\" tests involved safety testing of nuclear weapons—assuring that the core would not accidentally undergo criticality in the event of a fire or crash. These minor tests left a legacy of radioactive contamination at Maralinga.\n\nThe Australian government prohibited hydrogen bomb tests in Australia, so Britain had to look for another test site for its hydrogen bombs. The first British hydrogen bombs were tested during Operation Grapple at Malden Island and Christmas Island in the Pacific Ocean. Nine tests were conducted there in 1957, 1958 and 1959, ultimately demonstrating that the UK had developed expertise in thermonuclear weapons.\n\nBeginning in December 1962, the UK conducted 24 tests at the Nevada Test Site in the United States. The final test was the Julin Bristol shot which took place on 26 November 1991. British nuclear testing was abruptly halted by President George H. W. Bush in October 1992. Because Britain did not test as often as the United States for financial and political reasons, and did not have the Americans' state-of-the-art computer facilities, British weapons design depended more on theoretical understanding, with potential for both greater advances and greater risks between tests.\n\nThe United Kingdom, along with the United States and the Soviet Union, signed the Partial Test Ban Treaty, which restricted it to underground nuclear tests by outlawing testing in the atmosphere, underwater, or in outer space, on 5 August 1963. The UK signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, ending all nuclear testing, on 24 September 1996, and ratified it on 6 April 1998, having passed the necessary legislation on 18 March 1998 as the Nuclear Explosions (Prohibition and Inspections) Act 1998. Subcritical nuclear tests continued to occur, most notably the Etna test in February 2002, and the Krakatau test in February 2006.\n\nAltogether Forty-five nuclear tests were carried out by the United Kingdom between 3 October 1952 to 26 November 1991 at the Montebello Islands, Emu Field and Maralinga in Australia, on Christmas and Malden Islands in Kiribati, and at the Nevada Test Site in the United States. The 45 tests included 21 tests carried out in the atmosphere.\n\nIn the early years of the Cold War, the majority of the bomber force of the US Strategic Air Command (SAC) was made of Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers, and later its successors, the Boeing B-50 Superfortress and the Boeing B-47 Stratojet, all of which lacked the necessary range to reach targets in the Soviet Union from bases in the continental United States. Even small number of Convair B-36 Peacemaker bombers could not make it there and back. Overseas bases were therefore required, and the need for bases in the UK was a feature of American war planning for over a decade.\nObtaining British permission was easy thanks to the wartime comradeship between the RAF and the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). Bypassing the politicians, General Carl Spaatz, the commander of the USAAF, came to an agreement with the Chief Of the Air Staff, Marshal of the Royal Air Force Lord Tedder, in June and July 1946. Work began on extended and strengthened runways at RAF airbases in East Anglia to receive the B-29s. In June 1947, nine B-29s of the 97th Bombardment Group deployed to RAF Marham, where they were greeted by Tedder. This was merely a test; the bombers were not nuclear-capable. Only the Silverplate B-29s of the 509th Bombardment Group could do so. Their first deployment was in April 1949. Ninety sets of bomb assemblies—atomic bombs without the fissile cores—were stored in the UK by July 1950, and authority to deploy the cores as well was given in April 1954.\n\nThe 3rd Air Division was formed in 1949 to control the deployments of B-29s to the UK. It was soon upgraded to the status of a major command, and became the Third Air Force in May 1951 as part of the United States Air Forces in Europe. SAC then formed the 7th Air Division to control the nuclear bomber deployments. In fulfilment of NATO's plans to halt a Soviet invasion of Western Europe using tactical nuclear weapons, the 3rd Air Force received its own nuclear weapons when the 20th Fighter Wing deployed to RAF Wethersfield in Essex on 1 June 1952, with Republic F-84F Thunderstreak fighters and Mark 7 nuclear bombs. It reequipped with the North American F-100 Super Sabre in 1957, and the General Dynamics F-111 in 1970. The US Navy's Polaris ballistic missile submarines arrived at Holy Loch in Scotland in March 1961.\n\nWith the introduction to service of long-range bombers and intercontinental ballistic missiles, the need for a SAC presence in the UK diminished, On 3 April 1964, the last SAC aircraft, a B-47 from the 380th Bombardment Wing, left RAF Brize Norton, ending nearly 12 years' of continual B-47 deployments, and the 7th Air Division on 30 June 1964. The tactical nuclear weapons remained. In the 1970s, up to 60 F-111s based in the UK were on quick reaction alert, each carrying multiple B61 nuclear bombs. About 70 F-111s were based in the UK from 1971. In 1977, the Labour government gave permission for another 90 to be deployed. During the 1980s nuclear armed USAF Ground Launched Cruise Missiles (GLCMs) were deployed at RAF Greenham Common and RAF Molesworth, as a consequence of the 1979 NATO Double-Track Decision, under which NATO countries agreed to modernise the alliance's nuclear weapons.\n\nUnder the terms of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with the Soviet Union, the United States withdrew its surface naval nuclear weapons and short-range nuclear forces. The GLCMs were withdrawn from the UK in 1991, and the Polaris submarine base at Holy Loch was closed in 1992. The US continued to store tactical nuclear weapons in the UK until 2006, when approximately 110 tactical B61s stored at RAF Lakenheath for deployment by USAF F-15E Strike Eagle aircraft were removed.\n\nBritain was extremely vulnerable to nuclear weapons. The 1955 Strath Committee grimly estimated that an attack on the UK with just ten 10-megaton weapons would kill 12 million people and seriously injure another 4 million even before the country was blanketed with radioactive fallout.\n\nThe UK has relied on the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS) and, in later years, Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites for warning of a nuclear attack. Both of these systems are owned and controlled by the United States, although the UK has joint control over UK-based systems. One of the four component radars for the BMEWS is based at RAF Fylingdales in North Yorkshire.\n\nIn 2003 the UK government stated that it would consent to a request from the US to upgrade the radar at Fylingdales for use in the US National Missile Defense system, but missile defence was not a significant political issue within the UK. The ballistic missile threat was perceived to be less severe, and consequently less of a priority, than other threats to its security. Fylingdales was enhanced to an Upgraded Early Warning Radar (UEWR) in 2008, and became part of the United States national missile defense system in 2011.\n\nDuring the Cold War, a significant effort by government and academia was made to assess the effects of a nuclear attack on the UK. There were four major exercises:\n\nSuccessive governments developed civil defence programmes aimed to prepare civilian and local government infrastructure for a nuclear strike on the UK. A series of seven Civil Defence Bulletin films were produced in 1964, and in the 1980s the most famous such programme was probably the series of booklets and public information films entitled \"Protect and Survive\".\nThe booklet contained information on building a nuclear refuge within a so-called \"fall-out room\" at home, sanitation, limiting fire hazards, and descriptions of the audio signals for attack warning, fall-out warning and all clear. It was anticipated that families might need to stay in their fall-out room for up to 14 days after an attack almost without leaving it at all. The government also prepared a recorded announcement which was to have been broadcast by the BBC if a nuclear attack ever did occur. Sirens left over from the London Blitz during World War II were also to be used to warn the public. The system was mostly dismantled in 1992.\n\nThe Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE), Aldermaston, formerly the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment (AWRE), is situated on a near Reading in Berkshire. It was built on the site of the former RAF Aldermaston, which was converted to nuclear weapons research, design and development establishment, and opened on 1 April 1950. In 1954 the AWRE took control of the nearby ROF Burghfield, where warheads were assembled, and the test ranges at Foulness and Orford Ness. Components for nuclear weapons were also produced at the former ROF Cardiff site.\n\nThe Atomic Weapons Research Establishment became part of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority on 1 January 1955. The last trials at Orford Ness were conducted on 9 June 1971, and the site was closed on 1 October 1971.\nCardiff closed in 1997, and Foulness by the end of that year. In 1989, the government announced its intention to find a private company to run AWE, with the government retaining ownership of the site and control of AWE though a golden share arrangement. In 1993, the contract was awarded to a consortium of Hunting Engineering, Brown and Root and AEA Technology. In 1999, the contract was transferred to a consortium of BNFL, Lockheed Martin and Serco. In 2008, the British government sold the BNFL share to Jacobs Engineering Group.\n\nNuclear warheads from the Trident missiles are transported by road convoy several times a year from Coulport to Burghfield for refurbishment. Between 2000 and 2016 there were 180 accidents involving the vehicles, ranging from minor traffic accidents to a sudden total loss of power in one of the 44-tonne lorries that halted a convoy and caused a double lane closure and a tailback on the M6 motorway. The accidents have been more frequent in recent years.\n\nThe anti-nuclear movement in the United Kingdom consists of groups who oppose nuclear technologies such as nuclear power and nuclear weapons. Many different groups and individuals have been involved in anti-nuclear demonstrations and protests over the years. One of the most prominent anti-nuclear groups in the UK is the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND). This national movement was founded in the late 1950s, initially in opposition to nuclear testing. It reached its peak around 1960, by which time it had evolved into a broader movement calling for Britain to unilaterally give up nuclear weapons, withdraw from NATO, and end the basing of US bombers armed with nuclear weapons in the UK.\n\nThe end of atmospheric nuclear testing, internal squabbles, and activists focusing their energies on other causes led to a rapid decline, but it revived in the early 1980s in the wake of the Thatcher government's December 1979 decision to deploy US GLCMs in the UK, and the announcement of its decision to purchase Trident in July 1980. Membership leapt from 3,000 in 1980 to 50,000 a year later, and rallies for unilateral nuclear disarmament in London in October 1981 and June 1982 attracted 250,000 marchers, the largest ever mass demonstrations in the UK up to that time.\n\nThere was little dissent in the House of Commons from the government's nuclear weapons policy; it had almost bipartisan support until 1960, with only the Liberals temporarily dissenting in 1958. Despite opposition from its left wing the Labour party supported British nuclear weapons but opposed tests, and Labour Opposition Leader Hugh Gaitskell and shadow foreign secretary Aneurin Bevan agreed with Sandys on the importance of reducing dependence on the American deterrent. Bevan told his colleagues that their demand for unilateral nuclear disarmament would send a future Labour government \"naked into the conference chamber\" during international negotiations.\nThe \"Manchester Guardian\" and other newspapers critical of the Conservative government supported the British deterrent, although the \"Guardian\" did criticise the government for relying on developing bombers rather than missiles to carry the weapons. In 1962 it stated that the forthcoming Chinese nuclear weapon was a reason for having more than one Western nuclear nation. From 1955 the government chose to emphasize the nuclear deterrent and de-emphasize conventional forces. \"The Economist\", the \"New Statesman\", and many left-wing newspapers supported the reliance on nuclear deterrence and nuclear weapons, but in their view considered that of the United States would suffice, and that of the costs of the \"nuclear umbrella\" was best left to be borne by the United States alone.\n\nGaitskell's Labour party ceased supporting an independent deterrent in 1960 via its new \"Policy for Peace\", after the cancellation of Blue Streak made nuclear independence less likely. Labour also adopted a resolution favouring unilateral disarmament. Although Gaitskell opposed the resolution and it was reversed in 1961 in favor of continuing support of a general Western nuclear deterrent, the party's opposition to a British deterrent remained and became more prominent.\n\nThis became a campaign issue during the 1964 general election. Alec Douglas-Home's incumbent Conservatives stated that the British deterrent was both necessary for independence from the Americans and maintaining British world influence, and was \"working for peace\" in such cases as the passage of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Led by Gaitskell's successor Harold Wilson, Labour emphasized domestic economic issues but called deterrence the \"Tory Nuclear Pretense\" which would be neither independent nor effective. The populace's greater interest in domestic over foreign policy likely contributed to Labour's victory.\n\nThe 1982 Labour Party Conference adopted a platform calling for the removal of the GLCMs, the scrapping of Polaris and the cancellation of Trident. This was reaffirmed by the 1986 conference. While the party was given little chance of winning the 1983 election in the aftermath of the Falklands War, polls had shown Labour ahead of the Conservatives in 1986 and 1987. In the wake of Labour's unsuccessful performance in the 1987 election, the Labour Party leader, Neil Kinnock, despite his own unilateralist convictions, moved to drop the party's disarmament policy, which he saw as a contributing factor in its defeat. The party formally voted to do so in October 1989.\n\nPro-independence Scottish political parties—the Scottish National Party (SNP), Scottish Green Party, Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) and Solidarity—are opposed to the basing of the Trident system close to Glasgow, Scotland's largest city. Some members and ex-members of those parties, such as Tommy Sheridan and Lloyd Quinan, have taken part in blockades of the base. In the House of Commons vote in 2007, the majority of Scottish members of parliament (MPs) voted against upgrading the system, while a substantial majority of English, Welsh and Northern Irish MPs voted in favour.\n\nThe UK has relaxed its nuclear posture since the collapse of the Soviet Union. The Labour government's 1998 Strategic Defence Review made reductions from the plans announced by the previous Conservative government:\n\nCurrent UK posture is as it has been for many years; Trident SLBMs still provide the long-range strategic element. Until 1998 the aircraft-delivered, free-fall WE.177 bombs provided a sub-strategic option in addition to their designed function as tactical battlefield weapons. With the retirement of WE.177, a sub-strategic warhead is used with some (but not all) deployed Trident missiles. The 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review further pledged to reduce its requirement for operationally available warheads from fewer than 160 to no more than 120. In a January 2015 written statement, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon reported that \"all Vanguard Class SSBNs on continuous at-sea deterrent patrol now carry 40 nuclear warheads and no more than eight operational missiles\". In April 2017 Defence Secretary Michael Fallon confirmed that the UK would use nuclear weapons in a pre-emptive nuclear strike under \"the most extreme circumstances\".\n\nThe precise details of how a British Prime Minister would authorise a nuclear strike remain secret, although the principles of the Trident missile control system is believed to be based on the plan set up for Polaris in 1968, which has now been declassified. A closed-circuit television system was set up between 10 Downing Street and the SSBN Control Officer at the Northwood Headquarters of the Royal Navy. Both the Prime Minister and the SSBN Control Officer would be able to see each other on their monitors when the command was given. If the link failed – for instance during a nuclear attack or when the PM was away from Downing Street – the Prime Minister would send an authentication code which could be verified at Northwood. The PM would then broadcast a firing order to the SSBN submarines via the Very Low Frequency radio station at Rugby. The UK has not deployed control equipment requiring codes to be sent before weapons can be used, such as the U.S. Permissive Action Link, which if installed would preclude the possibility that military officers could launch British nuclear weapons without authorisation.\n\nUntil 1998, when it was withdrawn from service, the WE.177 bomb was armed with a standard tubular pin tumbler lock (as used on bicycle locks) and a standard allen key was used to set yield and burst height. Currently, British Trident missile commanders are able to launch their missiles without authorisation, whereas their American counterparts cannot. At the end of the Cold War the U.S. Fail Safe Commission recommended installing devices to prevent rogue commanders persuading their crews to launch unauthorised nuclear attacks. This was endorsed by the Nuclear Posture Review and Trident missile Coded Control Devices were fitted to all U.S. SSBNs by 1997. These devices prevented an attack until a launch code had been sent by the Chiefs of Staff on behalf of the President. The UK took a decision not to install Trident CCDs or their equivalent on the grounds that an aggressor might be able to wipe out the British chain of command before a launch order had been sent.\nIn December 2008 BBC Radio 4 made a programme titled \"The Human Button\", providing new information on the manner in which the United Kingdom could launch its nuclear weapons, particularly relating to safeguards against a rogue launch. The former Chief of the Defence Staff and Chief of the General Staff, General Lord Guthrie of Craigiebank, explained that the highest level of safeguard was against a prime minister ordering a launch without due cause. The constitutional structure of the United Kingdom provided some protection against such an occurrence, as while the Prime Minister is the chief executive and so practically commands the armed services, the formal commander-in-chief is the monarch, to whom the chief of the defence staff could appeal: \"the chief of the defence staff, if he really did think the prime minister had gone mad, would make quite sure that that order was not obeyed ... You have to remember that actually prime ministers give direction, they tell the chief of the defence staff what they want, but it's not prime ministers who actually tell a sailor to press a button in the middle of the Atlantic. The armed forces are loyal, and we live in a democracy, but actually their ultimate authority is the Queen.\"\n\nThe same interview pointed out that while the Prime Minister would have the constitutional authority to fire the Chief of the Defence Staff, he could not appoint a replacement as the position is appointed by the monarch. The programme also addressed the workings of the system; detailing that two persons are required to authenticate each stage of the process before launching, with the submarine captain only able to access the firing trigger after two safes have been opened with keys held by the ship's executive and weapons engineering officers. It was explained that all Prime Ministers issue hand-written orders, termed the letters of last resort, seen by their eyes only, sealed and stored within the safes of each of the four Royal Navy Vanguard class submarines. These notes instruct the submarine commander of what action to take in the event of the United Kingdom being attacked with nuclear weapons that destroy Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and/or the chain of command.\n\nAlthough the final orders of the Prime Minister are at his or her discretion, and no fixed options exist, there were four known options: retaliating with nuclear weapons, not retaliating with nuclear weapons, the submarine commander uses his own judgement, or the submarine commander places himself under United States or Australian command if possible. This system of issuing notes containing orders in the event of the head of government's death is said to be unique to the United Kingdom (although the concept of written last orders, particularly of a ship's captain, is a naval tradition), with other nuclear powers using different procedures. The letters are destroyed unopened whenever a Prime Minister leaves office.\n\nAll former prime ministers have supported an \"independent nuclear deterrent\", including David Cameron. Only one, James Callaghan, has given any insight on his orders; Callaghan stated that, although in a situation where nuclear weapon use was required – and thus the whole purpose and value of the weapon as a deterrent had failed – he would have ordered use of nuclear weapons, if needed: \"if we had got to that point, where it was, I felt it was necessary to do it, then I would have done it (used the weapon) ... but if I had lived after pressing that button, I could have never forgiven myself.\" Denis Healey, the Secretary of State for Defence and \"alternate decision-taker\" under Harold Wilson, said that in the event of Soviet nuclear weapons attacking the United Kingdom and the Prime Minister had been killed or incapacitated, he would not have ordered a retaliation.\n\nThe United Kingdom is one of the five nuclear-weapon states legally recognised as such under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). , nine countries have nuclear weapons. After the UK government announced its plans to refurbish its Trident missiles and build new submarines to carry them, it published a white paper on \"The Future of the United Kingdom's Nuclear Deterrent\", in which it stated that the renewal is fully compatible with the United Kingdom's treaty commitments and international law. At the start of the House of Commons debate to authorise the replacement of Trident, Margaret Beckett, the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, stated:\n\nThe subsequent vote was won overwhelmingly, including unanimous support from the opposition Conservative Party. The Government's position remained that it was abiding by the NPT in renewing Trident, and Britain has the right to possess nuclear weapons, a position reiterated by Tony Blair on 21 February 2007. Only the United Kingdom has expressed its opposition to the establishment of a new legally binding treaty to prevent the threat or use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states, through its vote in the United Nations General Assembly in 1998.\n\nThe United Kingdom decided not to sign the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, a binding agreement for negotiations for the total elimination of nuclear weapons, supported by more than 120 nations.\n\n\n"}

Atari withdrew largely from the computer market in 1993, and completely in 1995-1996 when Atari merged with JTS and all support for the platform by Atari was dropped. The systems Atari had built became increasingly left behind as newer and faster systems came out. The few dedicated users who were left wanted more processing power to develop more-advanced TOS applications, paving the way for a number of \"clone\" machines, such as the 68040-based Milan and the 68060-based Hades, both of which were considerably more powerful than the 68030-based TT and Falcon and the 68000-based ST/STe. These machines support ISA and PCI buses, which make the use of network and graphics cards designed for the PC possible (something no original Atari machines could do). The machines also support tower cases, making it possible to use internal CD drives.\n\nA new clone named Phoenix never made it to market in final form. However, the powerful rev. 6 68060 CPU it would use did make it into a new accelerator board for the Falcon, the CT60/CT63 series, which meant that, for the first time, the Atari platform had a CPU rated at over 100 MHz. The use of a high-speed bus and PC133 RAM also accounted for a big performance improvement and significantly increased the Falcon's on-board memory limit from 14 MiB to 512 MiB with a CT60.\n\nThese systems were not mass-produced and are now hard to find. While the CT60/CT63 needs a Falcon “donor” system, and is still not as powerful as the ACP potential system could be, the ACP will use a completely new design, moving away from 68K CPUs to the newer ColdFire class, more powerful than even the fastest 68K chips while still having a largely similar (but not completely compatible) instruction set. It will also allow for the integration of many I/O ports that are currently only available through extensive hardware modification on the Atari platform.\n\nThe specifications for the ACP have changed considerably over time, in response to advancing technology and price considerations. However, it seems the following will be in the final design according to Atari Coldfire Project homepage:\n\n\nOn the 8MB ROM, FireBee devices have the following pre-installed software:\n\nThere's a ready to use FreeMiNT and GUI environment setup with applications ported to work on ColdFire which can be ordered on CompactFlash card with the device.\n\nµClinux has also been ported to FireBee.\n\nThere are different strategies for dealing with the differences in ColdFire and 68K instruction set and opcodes:\n\nFireBee FPGA doesn't yet provide DSP functionality which means that any Atari Falcon specific programs requiring DSP won't run. Many Falcon games and demos use it to play background music.\n\n\n"}

Finney\n\nCharles Grandison Finney (December 1, 1905 – April 16, 1984) was an American news editor and fantasy novelist, the great-grandson of evangelist Charles Grandison Finney. His first novel and most famous work, \"The Circus of Dr. Lao\", won one of the inaugural National Book Awards: the Most Original Book of 1935.\n\nFinney was born in Sedalia, Missouri and served in China with the U.S. Army 15th Infantry Regiment (E Company) from 1927 to 1929.\n\nIn his memoirs, he notes that \"The Circus of Dr. Lao\" was conceived in Tientsin during 1929. After the Army, he worked as an editor for the \"Arizona Daily Star\" in Tucson, Arizona from 1930 to 1970.\n\nSome of Finney's papers, with correspondence and photographs, are collected at the University of Arizona Main Library Special Collections, Collection Number: AZ 024, \"Papers of Charles G. Finney, 1959-1966\". The archive includes typed manuscripts of \"A Sermon at Casa Grande\", \"Isabelle the Inscrutable\", \"Murder with Feathers\", \"The Night Crawler\", \"Private Prince\", \"An Anabasis in Minor Key\", \"The Old China Hands\", and \"The Ghosts of Manacle\".\n\nFinney's work, especially \"The Circus of Dr. Lao\", has been influential on subsequent writers of fantasy. Ray Bradbury admired the novel and anthologized it in \"The Circus of Dr. Lao and Other Improbable Stories\"; Bradbury's \"Something Wicked This Way Comes\" shares with \"Dr. Lao\" the setting of a supernatural circus. Arthur Calder-Marshall's \"The Fair to Middling\" (1959), Tom Reamy's \"Blind Voices\" (1978), Peter S. Beagle's \"The Last Unicorn\" (1968) and Jonathan Lethem's \"Chronic City\" (2009) were all influenced by Finney's work. \"7 Faces of Dr. Lao\" is the corresponding film adaptation.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1913 by a Russian group of settlers, members of the New Israel religious sect, who migrated under the influence of the then spiritual leader Vasily Lubkov, from the Voronezh region of Russia.\n\nIt is located west of Route 24, north of the department capital Fray Bentos, west of Young and south of Paysandú, the capital of Paysandú Department. Russian is the second official language after Spanish.\n\nA populated centre was founded here by 300 families of Russian settlers on 27 July 1913 They belonged to the Russian sect New Israel and were seeking religious freedom, which was denied to them under the Czar. Their leader, Basilio Lubkov had been imprisoned in Russia as a religious dissident. The settlers introduced the sunflower, as well as some advanced agricultural techniques to Uruguay. They constructed a flour mill and the first sunflower oil producing plant in the country. \n\nOn 1 July 1953, the status of San Javier was elevated to \"Pueblo\" (village) by the Act of Ley Nº 11.969. Until then, it had been the head of the judicial section of \"Bellaco\". On 17 November 1964 its status was further elevated to \"Villa\" (town) by the Act of Ley Nº 13.299.\n\nDuring the Uruguayan military dictatorship (1973–84) the Russian inhabitants were persecuted, as the military saw each one as a possible communist sympathizer. Many residents stopped speaking Russian, and most Russian books were destroyed. The cultural centre Máximo Gorki—where music, dance and other cultural activities were held—was closed, and traditional dance costumes were burnt. In 1984, the town became known throughout Uruguay for the execution of Vladimir Roslik, a Russian-Uruguayan medical doctor who was tortured and later killed by the Uruguayan military. For some he is a hero and a symbol of internal struggle in Uruguay.\n\nWith the restoration of democracy by 1989, the cultural centre Máximo Gorki has again been revived as a focal point for cultural activities in the town. It is home of the traditional dance group Kalinka, who have won many prizes in Uruguayan dance competitions.\n\nToday the inhabitants of San Javier are proud to have maintained many of their traditions, including food, dances, embroidery and music. They celebrate a festival on 27 July, the date of foundation, with a feast of traditional food, music and dancing. Over the years, Russian marriages have been memorable events with three days of festivities that include dancing, singing, and traditional meals.\nIn July 2013, celebrations were held remembering the arrival of the first Russian settlers.\n\nIn 2011, San Javier had a population of 1,781, of which 98% were of Russian descent.\nSource: \"Instituto Nacional de Estadística de Uruguay\"\n\nThe town is one of two access points for the new Esteros de Farrapos National Park and Islands of the Uruguay River, which is recognised under the Ramsar Convention as a Wetland of International Significance. Esteros de Farrapos which is 17,496 Ha, includes 24 islands. It is the last known refuge for the puma in Uruguay, and the only protected area where maned wolf have been recorded. Over 200 species of birds have been recorded in the park, 30 mammals, 14 reptiles, 8 amphibians and many butterflies.\n\nTourism is not yet well developed in the park, however there is limited accommodation in San Javier, and a well-equipped camping area at nearby Puerto Viejo ('Old Port'). Activities including fishing, boating, horse riding and birdwatching. Boats are available for hire, as well as experienced nature guides.\n\n"}

The airfield was part of the Northwest Staging Route, but was effectively abandoned in 1968. Since then, the Yukon government only maintains the first 27 miles of road, which serves two campgrounds and the Aishihik Lake hydroelectric station. The Champagne-Aishihik First Nation (CAFN) has an aboriginal interest in Aishihik and uses the location for traditional gatherings; it has used the site to host a gathering of the Council of Yukon First Nations when the rotation among member first nations took the gathering to the CAFN.\n\nThe Annie Lake Road is an 18-mile road in Mount Lorne hamlet that services residential areas, plus a golf course. During the 1980s, the Skukum Gold Mine made use of the road to connect across the Wheaton River to its gold mining operations.\n\nThe Snag Road is a primitive but driveable road that starts from the Alaska Highway south of Beaver Creek, leading approximately 15 miles to the former location of Snag, Yukon. Until 1968, Snag was a military airfield, established as part of the Northwest Staging Route, and the weather station here recorded, on February 3, 1947, the coldest official temperature in North America: 81 degrees below zero, Fahrenheit (-62.8 degrees Celsius). The personnel at the station could also hear conversations at the First Nations (Indian) village just about three miles away.\n\nUntil the 1970s, the Canadian customs station for Beaver Creek was still called Snag, at a time when the customs station was in the middle of Beaver Creek. Some travelers who missed the customs station, and who the police did not catch up to, traveled up the Snag Road looking for the customs station!\n\nThe Ross River Access Road connects Ross River with the Robert Campbell Highway, an approximate nine-mile road that replaces a poorer six-mile section of the Canol Road.\n\nThe Kusawa Lake Road, starting at historical mile 960 of the Alaska Highway, provides access to campgrounds on Kusawa Lake as well as a small number of area residents.\n\nThe Old Alaska Highway at Champagne served as part of the main highway until fall 2002. It remains open to provide access to Champagne and a traditional campsite.\n\nThe Bonanza Creek Road and the Hunker Creek Road in the historic Klondike mining district provide access to privately operated mines and some private homes in the Hunker Creek area. These roads are built to minimal standards, and the course of the Bonanza Creek road has been shifted in recent years to accommodate mining operations.\n\n"}

{"id": "2095739", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2095739", "title": "Arnold Lunn", "text": "Arnold Lunn\n\nSir Arnold Henry Moore Lunn (18 April 1888 – 2 June 1974) was a skier, mountaineer and writer. He was knighted for \"services to British Skiing and Anglo-Swiss relations\" in 1952. His father was a lay Methodist minister, but Lunn was an agnostic and wrote critically about Catholicism before he converted to that religion at the age of 45 and became an apologist.\n\nHe was born in Madras, India and died in London aged 86.\n\nArnold Lunn's father, Sir Henry Simpson Lunn (1859–1939), was firstly a Methodist minister and later founder of Lunn's Travel agency (that would become Lunn Poly), which encouraged tourism in the Swiss Alps. Arnold Lunn's brother, Hugh Kingsmill Lunn, became a noted literary journalist under the name Hugh Kingsmill. Lunn attended Orley Farm School, in Harrow, followed by Harrow School. He studied at Balliol College, Oxford, and while he was there, founded and was sometime President of the Oxford University Mountaineering Club.\n\nIntroduced to skiing by his father, he invented the slalom skiing race in 1922. Mathias Zdarsky had been running competitions through poles in the early years of the 20th century, but they were essentially style competitions, though they had to be completed within a specified time. In 1921 Lunn organized the first British national ski championship to include a national slalom race as well as jumping and cross-country. The 1921 slalom was decided on style, as Zdarsky's pole race had been. By 1922, however, Lunn, convinced that there was a real need for a race designed to test a skier's ability to turn securely and rapidly on steep Alpine ground, was insisting on speed being the only arbiter. \"The object of a turn is to get round a given obstacle losing as little speed as possible,\" he wrote. \"Therefore, a fast ugly turn is better than a slow pretty turn.\" On 1 January 1922, the Alpine Ski Challenge Cup, first held in 1920, was transformed into a challenge cup for slalom racing. On the practice slopes at Mürren, Lunn set pairs of flags through which the competitors had to turn, and the flags were so set as to test the main varieties of Alpine ski turns. Lunn's innovation was that the winner was simply the competitor who could make his way down in the shortest time. This first slalom was won by J. A. Joannides.\nLunn was the founder of the Alpine Ski Club (1908), the Ladies Ski Club (1923) and the Kandahar Ski Club (1924), and he was the organizer of many ski races around the world. He initiated in collaboration with the Austrian skier Hannes Schneider the Arlberg Kandahar Challenge Cup in honour of Lord Roberts of Kandahar. Through his efforts, the Downhill and Slalom races were introduced into the Olympic Games in 1936, although he opposed the Winter Olympic Games of that year being held in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. He later wrote, \"In 1936 the Olympic Committee paid Hitler the greatest compliment in their power by entrusting the Nazis with the organisation of the summer and winter Olympic Games.\" Lunn refereed the slalom in the 1936 Winter Olympics, and his son, Peter, was the captain of the British ski team, but neither marched in the opening procession or attended the lavish banquet organised by the Nazis.\n\nA double-black diamond trail at Taos Ski Valley, New Mexico is named for Sir Arnold Lunn. He was a long-standing member of the Committee of the International Ski Federation.\n\nLunn was the son of a Methodist lay preacher, but in his book \"Now I See\" (1933) he writes that the religious instruction he received at school was so \"woolly\" that \"I was never a Methodist, nor, for that matter, an Anglican, in any proper sense of the term.\" As a result, when he read Leslie Stephen's \"An Agnostic's Apology\", \"I found myself defenceless — thanks to the miserable deficiency of Anglican education — against his onslaughts.\" Lunn became an agnostic.\n\nIn 1924 he published \"Roman Converts\", which consisted of highly critical studies of five eminent converts to Roman Catholicism: John Henry Newman, Henry Edward Manning, George Tyrell, Gilbert Keith Chesterton and Ronald Knox.\n\nAt the same time, Lunn, who was, in Evelyn Waugh's words, \"restlessly reasonable\", was becoming increasingly disconcerted by the intense subjectivism of his age, and in particular by what he saw as the abandonment of reason in the realm of popular science (though not of science itself). He saw this as deriving from the philosophy of scientific materialism — the (extra-scientific) assumption that science points inevitably to materialism and that everything can be explained solely in terms of material processes. (Today the philosophical stance he critiqued would be called metaphysical naturalism.) In 1930 Lunn published \"The Flight from Reason\", in which he argued that scientific materialism is finally a philosophy of nihilism: it ends by questioning the very basis of its own existence. If materialism be true, Lunn argued, our thoughts are the mere product of material processes uninfluenced by reason. They are, therefore, determined by irrational processes, and the thoughts which lead to the conclusion that materialism is true have no basis in reason.\n\nIn the same year as \"The Flight from Reason\" appeared (1930), Lunn proposed to Knox an exchange of letters for subsequent publication in which he would advance all the objections he could conceive of to Roman Catholicism and Knox would reply. Knox accepted, and for more than a year the letters went to and fro. In 1932 they appeared as a book under the title \"Difficulties\". This exchange did much to clarify Lunn's mind, but even so, nearly two years were to elapse before he was received into the Catholic Church. In 1932 Lunn accepted a challenge from the noted philosopher C. E. M. Joad to discuss Christianity in a series of letters; they were published the following year as \"Is Christianity True?\" Joad, an agnostic, attacked Christianity on a wide variety of fronts, and Lunn, by now a believing Christian, if uncommitted to any particular denomination, responded. Lunn later wrote: \"I can imagine no better training for the Church than to spend, as I did, a year arguing the case against Catholicism with a Catholic, and a second year in defending the Catholic position against an agnostic.\"\n\nOn 13 July 1933, Mgr Knox received Lunn into the Catholic Church. Lunn's story of his conversion is related in \"Now I See\", which was published in November of the same year. Lunn became, in Evelyn Waugh's words, \"the most tireless Catholic apologist of his generation,\" and won the applause of fellow Catholic authors like Hilaire Belloc.\n\nDuring the Spanish Civil War, Lunn became a dedicated supporter of the Nationalist side; he wrote many anti-Republican articles for the British press, and was a member of the pro-Franco group Friends of National Spain. Lunn\nvisited the Nationalist lines during the war and interviewed the Spanish General Gonzalo de Aguilera Munro; Lunn praised\nAguilera as \"not only a soldier but a scholar\".\n\nLunn was also a supporter of Benito Mussolini, stating in a 1938 speech that Mussolini's Fascism \"has no sense of bullying\" and that life in Mussolini's Italy was \"largely the same\" as it was before Mussolini took power.\nLunn was opposed to Nazism for \"its excesses\", but lauded Neville Chamberlain for his signing of the\nMunich Agreement, saying Chamberlain did \"a splendid job\".\n\nLunn later became a friend of William F. Buckley, Jr. and a contributor to Buckley's \"National Review\". Lunn's\nwritings for the publication were marked by strong anti-communist sentiments.\n\nTowards the end of 1913 Lunn married Mabel Northcote, the granddaughter of Stafford Northcote, 1st Earl of Iddesleigh. They had three children, Peter, John and Jaqueta. Though not keen on mountaineering, Mabel shared her husband's love of skiing. She was the first woman to pass the British First Class skiing test, and she was a founder member of the Kandahar Ski Club. When her brother became 3rd Earl of Iddesleigh in 1927, she acquired the courtesy title of \"Lady Mabel\". Her husband wrote: \"In the aristocracy of Mürren she welcomed this modest reminder of the fact that inventing the Slalom was not the only Lunn claim to respect.\" The Swiss, however, could never understand how Arnold could be \"Mr. Lunn\" and his wife \"Lady Mabel\", and their feelings were aptly conveyed by a member of the Kandahar who congratulated him when he was knighted \"on making an honest Lady out of Mabel.\" Peter Lunn later became a noted British spymaster.\n\n\"Mabel,\" Lunn wrote, \"was invincibly English and I was much consoled during the dark days of 1940 by the fact that her confidence in final victory was never shaken.\" Lunn once said something nice to their daughter Jaqueta about the latter's courage during an air raid. For this he was later reproved by Mabel. \"I want Jaqueta to feel,\" she said, \"that the only thing which calls for comment in war time is cowardice.\" Lunn was an agnostic when they married, and Mabel a devout Anglican, which she remained all her life. Lunn wrote: \"Mabel's husband, brother and three children became Catholics, but I never expected her to follow our example. Humanly speaking, she was bound to remain a member of the Church of \"England\".\" An Anglican vicar once asked Lunn to preach in his church. \"I asked you,\" he said, \"because you have never written anything unpleasant about Anglicanism since you became a Roman Catholic.\" But Lunn could never have written \"anything unpleasant\" about Mabel's Church, and when the first shock of his conversion was over, \"Mabel soon yielded not merely notional but real assent to the belief that the doctrinal differences which separated Mabel the Anglican from Arnold the Catholic were infinitely, yes \"infinitely\", less than those which had separated Mabel the Anglican from Arnold the agnostic.\"\n\nLady Mabel Lunn died on 4 March 1959.\n\nTwo years later, on 18 April 1961, Lunn married Phyllis Holt-Needham. In the early 1930s, Lunn was on the point of advertising for a secretary when his wife told him that she had found the perfect secretary for him, the niece of a friend of hers. As his wife had made up her mind, all that remained was for Lunn to demonstrate his \"manly independence by a formal interview before engaging \"her\" candidate for the job.\" Two days later \"a rather shy-looking young woman\" was ushered into his office, Phyllis Holt-Needham. An account of the interview is given in Lunn's book \"Memory to Memory\". At the time Lunn was exchanging controversial letters with J. B. S. Haldane, published later under the title \"Science and the Supernatural\". Phyllis, who was an agnostic and very familiar with modern attacks on Christianity, confidently expected that Haldane would demolish Lunn, and was \"both surprised and annoyed\" by his inability to do so. Her first reaction was to find fault with Haldane as a controversialist and to be \"unduly complimentary\" about Lunn's controversial talents. Gradually, however, she began to suspect that it was the weakness of Haldane's case which enabled Lunn to get the better of his \"intellectual superior,\" and this was the first step in her return to the Christian faith.\n\nAlthough Phyllis was only mildly keen on skiing and never an accomplished practitioner, she was Assistant Editor to Lunn of the \"British Ski Year Book\". In recognition, the Club elected her an Honorary Member.\n\nNot long before his first wife died, Lunn wrote, she \"confided to a friend that if anything ever happened to her, Phyllis would take me on, and few second marriages have been so warmly welcomed by the husband's children and friends, and for less obvious reasons by the husband's hostesses.\"\n\n\n\nHe was a contributor to the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\", and editor, from 1920 to 1971, of the \"British Ski Year Book\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2095742", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2095742", "title": "The Screaming Blue Messiahs", "text": "The Screaming Blue Messiahs\n\nThe Screaming Blue Messiahs were a rock band, formed in 1983 in London by guitarist and singer Bill Carter, bass player and backing singer Chris Thompson and drummer Kenny Harris. The group emerged in the wake of the pub rock and punk scenes that had been very predominant on the UK capital's live music circuit during the late '70s/ early '80s. The band, a classic power trio, was active between 1983 and 1990 and released three major label LPs. They toured extensively throughout Europe, North America and Australasia, garnering wide critical acclaim for their aggressive blend of rhythm and blues, punk and rockabilly.\n\nBefore founding the Screaming Blue Messiahs, its three members had played together as The Small Brothers. Thompson and Carter had been part of the Captain Beefheart-influenced band Motor Boys Motor; together with Tony Moon on vocals, they recorded several tracks under that name on 24 August 1981 for John Peel's show on BBC Radio 1 and released a self-titled album. Initially, after Harris joined Carter and Thompson, the band briefly continued to perform under the name 'Motor Boys Motor'. According to Carter, the final name was chosen upon the suggestion of Ace/Big Beat's Ted Caroll, who was concerned that the band's initial proposal of 'The Blues Messiahs' sounded too pub rock.\n\nCarter employed a rhythmic, blues-influenced, feedback-laden guitar style, using mainly Fender Telecaster guitars together with two combo amps: a Mesa Boogie and an HH outfitted with Gauss speakers. For his occasional forays into slide, he favoured 'the mike stand, or whatever is handy', and that he only used open tunings 'when the strings go open by accident'.\n\nFeaturing a sound described as \"rockabilly from hell\" and a strong passion for Americana, cars, guns, aeroplanes and broadcast evangelism, the group released the mini-album \"Good and Gone\" on Big Beat Records. Its six songs, which had been selected from eleven songs recorded in spring 1984 with producer Vic Maile during a session at Elephant Studios in Wapping, London, included a version of Hank Williams' \"You're Gonna Change\". Upon its release, the EP entered the top twenty in the UK independent record chart, where it remained for six months.\n\nThe Screaming Blue Messiahs played their first official gig at 'Downstairs at the Clarendon', Hammersmith, London on 11 June 1984. On 24 July 1984, they performed the songs \"Good And Gone\", \"Someone To Talk To\", \"Tracking The Dog\" and \"Let's Go Down to the Woods And Pray\" during their first recorded session for the John Peel show on BBC Radio 1. Broadcast on 2 August, the session proved so popular that it resulted in two BBC releases, one a 4-track 12\" and a later inclusion of 'Good And Gone' on an album sampler of Peel Sessions. In December of the same year, The Screaming Blue Messiahs appeared on The Old Grey Whistle Test on the BBC, playing two live songs: \"Let's Go Down to the Woods And Pray\" and \"Good And Gone\", and then undertook a short tour of the Netherlands.\n\nIn January 1985, the band signed to WEA. The label re-released the mini-album \"Good and Gone\", and the band began work on \"Gun Shy\", their first full-length studio album, produced by Vic Maile. On 30 March 1985, BBC radio broadcast a live gig at the Paris Theatre in London. On 14 June, the Messiahs played their second BBC session, performing live versions of \"Good and Gone\", \"Tracking the Dog\" and \"Talking Doll\" for Andy Kershaw's show. In addition, the band extensively toured the UK, Finland, Belgium, Sweden, the Netherlands and Germany that year. The track 'Twin Cadillac Valentine\", having been influenced from the Spencer Davis Group song \"Strong Love\", was released as the first single from \"Gun Shy\" in the autumn of 1985. Commenting on the song, Carter has said, \"When we first went in the studio we didn't have anything, just the backing track. I was trying to get Kenny to play like on \"I Can See For Miles\". It's about girls...cars...love, attempted kidnapping and wide open spaces.\"\n\nThe release of \"Gun-Shy\" in early 1986 was met by a generally positive reception by select music press: \"Melody Maker\" stated, \"[t]hey have a gut instinct for the roots of blues and R 'n' B and from that sure base they can confidently blast their way through Bill Carter's extraordinarily powerful selection of songs\". The NME opined that, \"[o]n the strength of this album, I'd say the Messiahs are going to be very, very big indeed.\" To promote the album, the band embarked on another extensive tour of Germany, Finland, UK, USA—including a series of concerts supporting The Cramps—Australia and New Zealand. Two further singles, \"Smash The Market Place\" and \"Wild Blue Yonder\", were released from \"Gun-Shy\" in 1986. \"Wild Blue Yonder\" resurfaced in 2006 as the closing music of season 03, episode 04 of FX's \"Rescue Me\".\n\nTheir second album, \"Bikini Red\", was recorded over several months in studios around London and released in 1987. Produced by Maile, the record included songwriting contributions from Tony Moon. The first two singles released from the album were \"I Can Speak American\" and the title track.\n\nThe band returned to the BBC in November 1987 and recorded versions of \"Sweet Water Pools\", \"I Wanna Be a Flintstone\" and \"Big Brother Muscle\" from the \"Bikini Red\" LP for the Janice Long programme.\n\nJim Betteridge commented in \"International Musician\" magazine on Carter's playing style, saying that \"[h]e plays without a pick, crashing the flesh of his fingers into the strings with little regard for its mortality. Blood can often be seen splattered across the scratch plate – or the place where the scratch plate would be if it hadn't been removed. To avoid completely razoring the top of his fingers off, and I suppose also because he likes the sound, William uses unusually heavy bottom strings; Rotosound (and nothing else will do) 56, 48, 28, 16, 13 and 12. But he gives 'em such a sound thrashing that one string breaks every couple of numbers and often one a number, and I don't just mean the top strings; Es and As cop it an' all. In the words of his roadie, 'He goes fooking bonkers!'\"\n\nCarter's vocal delivery also attracted attention in the music press with, for example, John Dougan commenting: \"Carter wielded his instrument like a cross between Wilko Johnson and Pete Townshend; he was a deft soloist, but it was his tricky, complex rhythm playing that gave the band sheet-after-sheet of supercharged sound for a foundation. As impressive as his guitar playing was his voice: at times comically bawling, other times mumbling and imperceptible; in the course of a verse, Carter could sound righteously indignant, or suddenly frightened and confused\". The band's overall sound, according to Dougan, \"made for extreme, confrontational, and very, very exciting rock & roll\".\n\nOn the edition of 20 March 1987 of the Channel 4 TV show \"The Tube\", David Bowie announced that his favourite band of the moment was The Screaming Blue Messiahs. An avid fan of the group, Bowie reaffirmed his affection for the group on other occasions, for example, in the August '87 issue of \"Musician\" magazine: \"Well! The band this week – I've only just discovered them, so they're my pet project – is The Screaming Blue Messiahs. They're the best band I've heard out of England in a long time\", and when asked by \"Rolling Stone\" magazine in 1987 who his favourite band was, Bowie replied \"The Screaming Blue Messiahs. I love them. I think they're terrific.\"; and again in \"Words & Music\" magazine in January 1988: \"There’s an English band I like very much. Nobody seems to have heard of them. They’re called The Screaming Blue Messiahs and I’m pushing them like mad. I think they’re really good. There’s an element of The Clash in them that I really like. But there's something else there. I'm not really sure what it is. There's an exciting guitar player. He's a sort of new wave guitar player, but they're an angry mob from London.\" The admiration extended to an invitation for the Messiahs to join Bowie on a couple of his Glass Spider Tour dates in the UK. They supported at Cardiff Arms Park in Wales and Roker Park in Sunderland on the 21 and 23 June 1987.\n\nJanuary 1988 saw the release of \"I Wanna Be A Flintstone\", a reworked song from the \"Motor Boys Motor\" album, as a single. The record became an instant hit, peaking at number 28 in the UK charts. The song's success saw the band appearing on the BBC's \"Top of the Pops\" and Saturday morning kids' show \"No. 73\". Two videos were made for the song, both making use of cartoon clips from the Flintstones TV series. The single appeared in multiple formats, including picture discs and extended 12\" remix versions.\n\nCoinciding with their increased popularity due to \"I Wanna Be A Flintstone\", the band again toured extensively. In February 1988, the group played concerts in the UK, France, Belgium and Germany. In March they returned to the USA for an extended tour, supporting Echo & The Bunnymen. In April they toured further throughout the US, and late in the year visited Finland and played a few gigs in their native Britain. Commenting on the characteristic intensity of the band's stage performance at this time, Jon Pareles stated that \"although most rockers like to think their music carries a sense of danger, few bands come closer to raw mayhem than the Screaming Blue Messiahs.\"\n\nDespite having achieved critical acclaim and a hit record, a change of manager and a long touring schedule coupled with financial hardships after returning from tours began to take a toll on the band. To cope with the intensity of the band's live performances, Carter explained that \"I used to have to prepare myself all day ahead of the gig for the sheer emotional and physical onslaught. I used to put everything into the gigs. I'd come off stage all used up. I was so hot after, I would have to put ice on my head! Then we'd come back from touring and I'd have to sell guitars in order to live\". This sentiment was shared by Thompson, \"One minute I'd be signing autographs in Hollywood then I'd be back here painting skirting boards\".\n\nTheir third album, \"Totally Religious\" — jointly produced by Howard Gray and Robert Stevens — was recorded in Miami Sound Studios and Criteria Studios in Miami, Alaska Studios in Waterloo, London and Sheffield Recording in Phoenix, Maryland and released in 1989. To support the album's release, the Messiahs toured the UK in November, and in December played six concerts in Germany. A promo video for the track \"Four Engines Burning\" was shot, although no singles were released from the album. The group's relationship with its record label deteriorated, resulting in the removal of \"Totally Religious\" from distribution a month after its release. The band was dropped from its contract, and split up shortly afterwards, playing their last gig at The Subterrania Club in Notting Hill, London, on 5 June 1990. \n\nThe group's recordings were subsequently deleted from the WEA and Elektra catalogues and became unavailable.\n\nFollowing the split, Thompson and Harris played with Cajun outfit La Rue. They then reunited with Tony Moon and bass player Ricky McGuire from The Men They Couldn't Hang to form Dynamo Hum and released a 10\" EP entitled \"Four Cute Creatures\".\n\nKenny Harris went on to play with The Men They Couldn't Hang, followed by spells as a house husband, a baker and a published author.\n\nIn 1990, The Replacements released their album \"All Shook Down\". Unbeknownst to them, the Messiahs had released a single with the same title two years earlier. Upon learning this, Replacements frontman Paul Westerberg tried unsuccessfully to delay the release of the record to change the title.\n\nIn 1994, \"I Wanna Be A Flintstone\" was included on the soundtrack to the US version of the film \"The Flintstones\". In 1997 Dave 'Chalkie' Dawson, friend and photographer of the band in their early days, put together an official Screaming Blue Messiahs website at www.screamingbluemessiahs.co.uk\n\nAs of 2010, Bill Carter's musical output since the split has been limited to a few demos posted briefly on his MySpace website. Carter also returned to art, producing screen prints and digital work, exhibiting at the Jenny Granger Gallery and Kessaris Art.\n\nThe only new official Messiahs material to surface since 1989 has been the 1992 \"BBC Radio 1 Live in Concert\" CD, recorded at The Town & Country Club in London on 27 February 1988, and a home-produced live album of a show in Zurich, released in 2007. In 2009, Hux Records released an album titled \"The Screaming Blue Messiahs – Live at the BBC\" featuring live recordings of the band performing at the Paris Theatre in London in 1985 and BBC radio sessions recorded for the Andy Kershaw and Janice Long radio programmes in 1985 and 1987, respectively.\n\nIn 2009, Wounded Bird Records reissued the albums \"Gun Shy\" and \"Bikini Red\", which had been unavailable since the early 1990s.\n\nIn April 2009, Chris Thompson gave an interview with Chicago-based music website \"Consequence of Sound\" during which, when asked about the possibility of The Screaming Blue Messiahs reforming, he commented: \"Every couple of years I get a call from one of the others saying, \"Shall we re-form and do something\". I have always said, \"OK let's go!\" Then after about a week it fizzles out with some sort of drama. I had my bi-annual call recently. This time I said I wasn’t up for it as it’s just going to fizzle out in a week. Anyway, I’m having a lot of fun doing what I’m doing. But as they say, \"Never say Never\".\"\n\nIn July 2010, Thompson's band The Killer B's released an album titled \"Love is a Cadillac, Death is a Ford\" on Track Records. It also featured former Messiahs drummer Kenny Harris and former collaborator Tony Moon.\n\nIn November 2012, Chris Thompson and Kenny Harris recorded three tracks with Pat Collier at Perry Vale Studios, London, under the name of Horseface, with plans for further recording and gigs in 2013. The three tracks were made available for listening on SoundCloud.\n\nIn May 2017, Greg Gutfeld of Fox News interviewed Bill Carter for his Podcast \"The One w/ Greg Gutfeld\". Billed as \"his first interview since the band broke up in 1989\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Although the band experienced little chart success, their single \"More to Lose\" went on to become a teen anthem in the Philippines.\n\nWhile studying at University College London, Ricky Gervais and his friend Bill Macrae formed Seona Dancing, with Macrae writing the music and playing keyboards, and Gervais writing and singing the lyrics. After recording a sixteen-song demo tape, they were signed by London Records which released two of their singles: \"More to Lose\" and \"Bitter Heart\". In June 1983, the duo performed their single \"More to Lose\" on the ITV syndicated children's television show \"Razzmatazz\". Yet, despite the promotion of \"Bitter Heart\" through its music video and \"More to Lose\" by its TV performance, both singles failed to break the Top 40, with \"More to Lose\" charting at number 117 and \"Bitter Heart\" at number 79 on the UK Singles Chart. After the lacklustre performance of their two singles, the band split up in 1984.\n\nGervais went on to have a successful international career as a comedian and actor. When Jimmy Kimmel asked about Macrae in a 2014 interview, Gervais said, \"I hope he got fat, too.\"\n\nIn 1985, DWRT-FM (then known as 99.5 RT, now 99.5 Play FM), a radio station in Metro Manila, Philippines, started playing a song billed as \"Fade\" by Medium (also billed as \"Medium\" by Fade). DWRT-FM deliberately misnamed the artist and song title to prevent anyone from finding the record and playing it themselves. Additionally, to stop other radio stations from recording it and playing it, DWRT-FM inserted a station ID midway through the track. A year later, another radio station, DWXB-102, revealed the true identity of the song as \"More to Lose\" by Seona Dancing.\n\nThe song, which utilises an opening piano riff to convey the sound of falling teardrops, became a major radio and club hit as well as a favourite at high-school dances during the 1980s and beyond. AllMusic critic Michael Sutton wrote that the track was \"the theme song of angst-ridden New Wave youths in the Philippines\" and \"an '80s anthem as ubiquitous as Peter Gabriel's 'In Your Eyes', but with the eternal hipster cool of Joy Division's 'Love Will Tear Us Apart'.\"\n\n\nAn unofficial CD compiling of all of the band's songs (apart from the 7\" versions of \"Bitter Heart\" and \"Tell Her\"), titled \"More to Lose\", was released in 2005.\n"}

Tatum made his film debut in the drama film \"Coach Carter\" (2005). His breakthrough role was in the 2006 dance film \"Step Up,\" which introduced him to a wider audience.\n\nTatum is known for his leading role in \"Magic Mike\" (2012), and its sequel, \"Magic Mike XXL\" (2015) which he produced; he also starred in the action-comedy film \"21 Jump Street\" and its 2014 sequel, \"22 Jump Street\". He has also, appeared as the character Duke in the 2009 action film \"\" and its 2013 sequel \".\" He appeared in romantic films such as \"Dear John\" (2010) and \"The Vow\" (2012). His other films include \"She's the Man\" (2006), \"The Dilemma\" (2011), \"White House Down\" (2013), the drama \"Foxcatcher\" (2014), \"The Hateful Eight\" (2015), \"Hail, Caesar!\" (2016), and \"Logan Lucky\" (2017).\n\nTatum was born in Cullman, Alabama, the son of Kay Tatum (née Faust), an airline worker, and Glenn Tatum, who worked in construction. He has a sister named Paige. He is mostly of English ancestry.\n\nHis family moved to the Pascagoula, Mississippi area when he was six. He grew up in the bayous near the Pascagoula River, where he lived in a rural setting.\n\nTatum has discussed having dealt with attention deficit disorder (ADD) and dyslexia while growing up, which affected his ability to do well in school. Growing up, Tatum played football, soccer, track, baseball, and performing martial arts; he has said that \"girls were always [his] biggest distraction in school.\" As a child, he practiced wuzuquan kung fu.\n\nTatum spent most of his teenage years in the Tampa area, and initially attended Gaither High School. His parents wanted more effort and gave him the option of selecting a private high school or attending a military school; he chose Tampa Catholic High School, where he graduated in 1998 and was voted most athletic. He later attended Glenville State College in Glenville, West Virginia on a football scholarship, but dropped out. He returned home and started working odd jobs.\n\n\"Us Weekly\" reported that around this time Tatum left his job as a roofer and began working as a stripper at a local nightclub, under the name \"Chan Crawford\". In 2010, he told an Australian newspaper that he wanted to make a movie about his experiences as a stripper. That idea led to the movie \"Magic Mike\". Tatum moved to Miami, where he was discovered by a model talent scout.\n\nIn 2000, Tatum was first cast as a dancer in Ricky Martin's \"She Bangs\" music video, after an audition in Orlando, Florida; he was paid $400 for the job. His experience in the fashion industry began as a model working for noted clients such as Armani and Abercrombie & Fitch. He soon moved into television commercials, landing national spots for Mountain Dew and Pepsi in 2002. He subsequently signed with Page 305 (Page Parkes Modeling Agency), a modeling agency in Miami. He was cast by Al David for \"Vogue\" magazine and soon after appeared in campaigns for Abercrombie & Fitch, Nautica, Dolce & Gabbana, American Eagle Outfitters, and Emporio Armani. He was picked as one of \"Tear Sheet\" magazine's \"50 Most Beautiful Faces\" of October 2001. Tatum signed with Ford Models in New York City.\n\nIn 2006, Tatum starred in \"She's The Man\" opposite Amanda Bynes, which was named the greatest modern Shakespearean remake by \"Business Insider\". Later that year, Tatum starred opposite his former wife Jenna Dewan in \"Step Up\", which was his breakout role. Although it was widely panned, it has earned $115 million worldwide.\n\nIn 2008, Tatum co-starred in director Kimberly Peirce's film \"Stop-Loss\", about soldiers returning home from the Iraq War, and in director Stuart Townsend's film \"Battle in Seattle\", about the 1999 protest of the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle. Tatum played in the short film \"The Trap\", directed by Rita Wilson.\n\nTatum and Dito Montiel, who worked together on \"A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints\", reteamed on the action drama \"Fighting\" for Rogue Pictures. Tatum starred as Sean McArthur, a young man who scrapes up a living scalping tickets in New York City. Tatum next appeared in writer/director/producer Michael Mann's 2009 crime drama \"Public Enemies\", playing the 1930s American gangster Pretty Boy Floyd. The same year, Tatum starred as Duke in \"\", Paramount Pictures' live-action film based on the popular Hasbro action figures. He was initially reluctant to take the role as he feared the movie would glorify war; however, he overcame his reluctance after reading the script. He played a soldier in \"Dear John\", a film based on the popular Nicholas Sparks bestseller. He later stated that he had accepted the role to learn from director Lasse Hallström because he had never studied at an acting school.\nIn an interview with \"Details\" magazine, published in early 2012, Tatum said he wants to produce all the films he stars in, \"I really don't want to be in any more movies that I don't produce. Unless it's with one of the 10 directors that I really want to work with, I don't have any interest in not being on the ground floor of creating it.\" He, his wife Dewan, and their production partner Reid Carolin signed a two-year production deal in 2010 with Relativity Media for any movies they may develop during that time. In 2012, Tatum hosted \"Saturday Night Live\" and appeared in four films. He co-starred in Steven Soderbergh's action-thriller \"Haywire\", \"The Vow\" with Rachel McAdams, and \"21 Jump Street\" (the film adaptation of TV series of the same name) with Jonah Hill.\n\nHe also starred in \"Magic Mike\", a film about his eight-month experience as a male stripper in Florida. The film was directed by Soderbergh, was co-produced by Tatum and Soderbergh, and starred Tatum as Mike. He is a featured performer at a Tampa, Florida, male strip club who takes a younger dancer (Alex Pettyfer) under his wing to show him how to hustle \"on and off stage\". The film's cast also included Matt Bomer, Joe Manganiello, and Matthew McConaughey.\n\nIn November 2012 Tatum was named \"People\" magazine's annual Sexiest Man Alive.\n\nTatum appeared in Steven Soderbergh's \"Side Effects\", with Rooney Mara and Jude Law.\n\nHe reprised his role as Conrad S. Hauser/Duke in \"\", the sequel to 2009's \"\", in an ensemble cast that included Dwayne Johnson and Bruce Willis. Originally scheduled for release on June 29, 2012, the film was pushed back to March 2013, in order to convert it to 3D and to add more scenes for his character, who was killed at the beginning of the movie. Tatum later said he had not wanted to appear in the sequel and was happy his character had been killed off. Also in 2013, he appeared in another action movie, \"White House Down\".\n\nTatum reprised his role from \"21 Jump Street\" in its sequel, \"22 Jump Street\", which was released on June 13, 2014.\n\nAlso in 2014, he co-starred with Steve Carell in \"Foxcatcher\", the story of John du Pont, who suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and killed Olympic wrestler Dave Schultz, the brother of the character played by Tatum, who also had won Olympic gold. Tatum was set to star as X-Men character Remy LeBeau / Gambit in a solo film, set within the X-Men film universe, which he would have produced, but the film was cancelled in May 2019 after languishing in development hell since 2014.\n\nTatum started two production companies, 33andOut Productions and Iron Horse Entertainment. Their first production was the documentary \"Earth Made of Glass\".\n\nIn 2006, Tatum met actress Jenna Dewan on the set of their movie \"Step Up\"; they married on July 11, 2009, at Church Estates Vineyards in Malibu, California. They have a daughter who was born in May 2013 in London. On April 2, 2018, after nearly nine years of marriage, the couple announced they were separating. Six months later, Dewan filed for divorce from Tatum. The divorce was finalized in November 2019.\n\nIn 2018, Tatum started dating English singer Jessie J.\n"}

They had at least five children. \n\nIn December 1740, his father died and Seymour inherited his manors in Wiltshire and Devon. On 11 September 1744, with the unexpected death of George Seymour, Viscount Beauchamp (1725–1744), the only son of Algernon Seymour, Earl of Hertford, himself son and heir of Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset, the likelihood emerged of Seymour succeeding his distant cousin as Duke of Somerset and Baron Seymour, as the future 7th Duke was then aged sixty, and his wife was past child-bearing age. On 23 November 1750 the Duke died, and Seymour duly succeeded to his titles. However, he inherited little of the great wealth enjoyed by his two immediate predecessors, as the 7th Duke had arranged for the principal Percy family estates and houses of Alnwick Castle, Northumberland House, Petworth House, and Syon House to be divided between his daughter Elizabeth and his nephew Charles Wyndham. As a result, the Dukes of Somerset were never again among the greatest landowning families.\n\nSeymour's children were all born long before the dukedom came to him:\n\n\nThe 8th Duke of Somerset died between 12 and 15 December 1757, and was buried at Maiden Bradley on 21 December 1757.\n\n"}

The race starts at the base of the Squaw Valley ski resort and finishes at the Placer High School track in Auburn, California. The terrain is quite rugged, frequently showcasing snow on the highest passes and record hot temperatures throughout the course. Runners ascend a cumulative total of 18,090 feet (5500 m) and descend a total of 22,970 feet (7000 m) on mountain trails before reaching the finish. Because of the length, the race commences at 5 a.m. and continues through the day and into the night. Runners finishing before the 30-hour time limit for the race receive a commemorative bronze belt buckle, while runners finishing in under 24 hours receive a silver belt buckle.\n\nThe Western States 100 is sponsored by Altra, a Utah athletic footwear company, and is one of the five 100-mile races that comprise the Grand Slam of Ultrarunning, which also includes the Old Dominion 100, Vermont 100 Mile Endurance Run, the Wasatch Front 100 Mile Endurance Run in Utah, and the Leadville Trail 100 in Colorado.\n\nThe Western States Trail Ride was first completed on foot by seven soldiers from Fort Riley, Kansas during the 1972 event, proving that the 100-mile mountain course could be marched in less than two days. In 1974 Gordy Ainsleigh was the first to run it in under 24 hours. Ainsleigh had finished the Western States Trail Ride (Tevis Cup) in 1971 and 1972 on horseback, but in 1973 his new horse was pulled with lameness at the 29-mile checkpoint. In 1974, with the inspiration and encouragement of Drucilla Barner, the first woman to win the Tevis Cup and Secretary of the Western States Trail Foundation, Gordy joined the horses of the Western States Trail Ride to see if he could complete the course on foot in under 24 hours. Twenty-three hours and forty-two minutes later Gordy arrived in Auburn, proving that a runner could indeed, travel the 100 miles in one day.\n\nIn 1975, Ron Kelley ran the Tevis Cup course along with the horses, and completed 97 miles (157 km) of the course before dropping out. In 1976, Ken \"Cowman\" Shirk became the next to complete the course along with the horses, with Ainsleigh pacing him the last 25 miles.\n\nSixteen runners signed up for the first official Western States Endurance Run in 1977, and started along with the horses in the Tevis Cup. Thirteen of the 16 had dropped out or were pulled by the midpoint that year. Of the three remaining runners, only Andy Gonzales finished in the 24-hour time limit set for the horses. The other two, Peter Mattei and Ralph Paffenbarger, finished in 28 hours and 36 minutes (unofficially), leading to the establishment of the 30-hour bronze buckle time limit for runners. The Run organization later became its own entity: The Western States Endurance Run Foundation.\n\nThe following year, 1978, 63 runners competed and 30 runners finished the first Western States Endurance Run. The race was held on a separate date, independent of the Tevis Cup Trail Ride.\n\nAs the event grew in notoriety, a lottery system was created in 1981 to allocate the available positions. A limited number of entries will be reserved to the top two men and the top two women finishers of the five Altra Golden Ticket Series races and the top-ten finishers of the preceding Western States race. After the few select entries are awarded, a lottery is then held to fill the field from a pool of qualified applicants. In 2017, a wait list was implemented with replacement runners selected from the wait list to ensure that the 369 allowable starting spots are completely filled.\n\nIn 1984, the Granite Chief Wilderness was created under the provisions of the 1964 Wilderness Act, and about four miles (6 km) of the trail were within the new boundaries. The wilderness designation would normally mean that the Forest Service would not be able to allow organized events in the area. In 1988, however, the Endurance Run (and the original Trail Ride) was finally given Congressional permission to continue, but with the number of runners limited to 369, the size of the 1984 field.\n\nTim Twietmeyer, an ultra-marathoner from California completed the race a record 25 times, all in under 24 hours, and winning the race five times.\n\nScott Jurek's 2005 victory was his seventh consecutive win. \n\nAnn Trason won the women's race fourteen times.\n\nIn 2008 the race was canceled due to bad air quality and smoke from an unprecedented number of wildfires.\n\nThe 2009 winners of the race were Hal Koerner and Anita Ortiz. In 2010, Geoff Roes overtook Anton Krupicka at the Brown's Bar checkpoint with 10.1 miles to go to win the race and set a new course record with 15:07:04. Tracy Garneau won the women's race in 19:01:55. Amy Palmiero-Winters, a transtibial amputee, became the first amputee in history to complete the race, in 27:43:10.\n\nIn 2012, Ellie Greenwood bested the seemingly unbreakable course record set by Ann Trason in 1994 by nearly an hour with a new record time of 16:47:19. The same year, Timothy Olson ran a sub 15 hour race (14:46:44) and in the process, broke the previous course record that was set by Geoff Roes in 2010.\n\nIn 2016, Andrew Miller, 20, became the youngest male winner of the Western States 100 after newcomer Jim Walmsley, the forecasted winner, took a wrong turn approaching the north fork of the American River near mile 95. \n\nFor the 2018 year, Jim Walmsley broke the course record and ended a streak of failed attempts with a 14:30:04 finish.

A densely populated residential area, with some industry, it is also the site of Ireland's largest children's hospital.\n\nCrumlin covers the area from the River Poddle near the KCR (Kimmage Cross Roads) to Sundrive Road and Crumlin Cross at \"The Submarine Bar\" to Crumlin's village core and the Drimnagh Road, to Bunting Road, Crumlin Road then along the Grand Canal from Rialto Bridge to Sally's Bridge. It is situated near to the city centre, on the Southside of Dublin city. Neighbouring areas include Walkinstown, Perrystown, Drimnagh, Terenure, and Kimmage. Crumlin is contained within postal district Dublin 12.\n\nCrumlin gets its name from the crooked valley known as Lansdowne Valley. The valley was formed by glacial erosion in the distant past and is now bisected by the River Camac. The valley depending on your point of view is situated in front of or behind Drimnagh and is largely made up of good quality built houses with lots of recreational parklands.\n\nDuring the medieval period, Dublin was surrounded by manorial settlements comprising church, graveyard, manor house, motte and bailey, farms and cottages. These settlements grew into a network of villages around Dublin creating stability and continuity of location. Crumlin Village developed as an Anglo-Norman settlement soon after the Norman Conquest in 1170, (although the circular configuration of the old graveyard of Saint Mary’s in the village suggests pre-Norman associations), and has survived through the centuries to become the village of today. The Old Saint Mary's Church stands on the site of a 12th-century church of the same dedication, and a succession of churches occupied the site down through the centuries to the present day.\n\nIn 1193, King John (the then Prince of Moreton) gave the Crumlin church to form one prebend in the collegiate church of Saint Patrick. When the main body of the present old church was rebuilt in 1817, the old tower of a much earlier origin was preserved.\n\nCrumlin, along with Saggart, Newcastle, Lyons and Esker (Lucan) was constituted a royal manor by King John sometime before the end of his reign in 1216. The English noble families of the time had strong links with Ireland, particularly in Leinster. For example, William Fitz John of Harptree was a lord of some significance in Somerset and likely to have served in Ireland under King John. At the beginning of the reign of King Henry III, Fitz John acquired the custody of the lands of William de Carew and held the royal manor of Crumlin, although he did not establish family roots in Ireland.\n\nAs the church was the nucleus of life on the manor in medieval times, we may with confidence place the centre of Crumlin’s medieval settlement in the area of Crumlin Village. This has been confirmed by recent archaeological excavations in the area of Saint Mary’sand the site of the former motte and earthworks on which the new St. Mary's Church was built.\nSome of the local amenities in Crumlin, such as Pearse College on Clogher Road and Ceannt park, are named after some of the 1916 Rebels who had a training camp in nearby Kimmage at Sundrive crossroads.\n\nCrumlin is home to Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, the largest children's hospital in the country.\nA great many roads are named after some of Ulsters towns and various Irish towns associated with pagan or religious sites/towns. There's a statue of the warrior Cúchulainn situated opposite St. Mary's Church at the junction with Bunting Road. He is said to have originated from the area (this bit is not true). The statue is for Oisín, he was a Kildare man who played hurling in the Crumlin area. Cúchulainn his father was from the Cooley mountains around Louth, South Armagh where the Cooley Road in Drimnagh gets its name and is described as a partially wooded landscape, the crooked glen being one of its main features. Today this valley can be seen behind Drimnagh Castle and was wild until recently turned into a golf course, albeit one that did not ruin its features but tried to use them in the main.\n\nNotable people who have lived in or been associated with the area include:\n\n\n\nBus Átha Cliath routes serving the Crumlin area are: 9, 17, 18, 27, 56A, 77A, 83, 83A, 122, 123, 150, 151.\n\n\nWhen the RTÉ drama \"Fair City\" launched in 1989, exterior shots were filmed in the Crumlin-Drimnagh area for the first three seasons of the programme (1989–93) until season four launched in 1994, the year the set in RTÉ, Donnybrook was completed.\nLocations used were as follows:\nIn 1994, replicas of the exterior of the houses used in the series were constructed in the Donnybrook studios. It is still filmed there to this day.\n\n"}

Thus, an interlocutory order is not final and is not subject to immediate appeal.\n\nIn many U.S. legal systems, interlocutory orders are not appealable, save for in a few extraordinary cases. Interlocutory orders are orders that are issued by a court while a case is still ongoing. These orders are not meant to be final. When the case is concluded, any aspect of an interlocutory order that has not become moot may be challenged in an appeal from the final judgment. However, in other legal systems, such as in England and Wales, in Hong Kong, and in Canada, interlocutory orders in civil matters can be appealed by leave of the appellate court. In criminal matters in Canada, the general rule is that there are no interlocutory appeals, except where Parliament has expressly provided. Australian courts and tribunals generally discourage appeals against interlocutory decisions.\n\n"}

The goal is to kill all the enemies. There are two types of enemies: Pookas (round red monsters with goggles), which can kill a player by touching him, and Fygars (dragons), which can kill a player either by touching him \"or\" breathing fire on him.\n\nTaizo Hori (the player's character) is armed with two weapons. One is an air pump that can inflate enemies until they burst. The other is a jackhammer, which can be used at \"fault lines\" on the map to create faults in the ground. If both ends of a system of faults reach the water, the ground surrounded by them will sink into the ocean, killing all creatures on it, including Taizo himself if the player is not careful. The points earned from this depend on how many enemies are killed at once. Once three pieces of land have been cut off an island, a bonus vegetable will appear somewhere on what remains of the island, which can be eaten for extra points. When only one, two or (on later rounds) three enemies remain on the island, the enemies will head for the edge of the island and jump into the water, killing themselves and ending the round.\n\nIn 2005, \"Dig Dug II\" was ported to the PlayStation Portable as part of \"Namco Museum Battle Collection\", and was included in \"Namco Museum DS\" which was released for the Nintendo DS on September 18, 2007. The game was also included in \"Namco Museum Virtual Arcade\" in 2008 and was released on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan on October 20, 2009, along with the inceptive title. Both \"Dig Dug\" games are available as part of the \"Namco Museum Megamix\" compilation for the Wii, which (much unlike the Virtual Console Arcade versions) was only released in North America.\n\nA reimagined version for PC titled \"Dig Dug Island\", featuring online multiplayer, was released in 2008 exclusively in Japan. However, the game's servers were shut down in just under a year, leaving it unplayable.\n"}

He set out on a Grand Tour at the age of 17, visiting Italy from 1701 to 1703 and Austria in 1705.\n\nSeymour was still in Austria when he was returned as Member of Parliament for Marlborough on the recommendation of his father at a by-election on 27 November 1705. In 1706 he was appointed Lord-Lieutenant of Sussex for the rest of his life. He went to Flanders in the summer of 1708 to serve as a volunteer under the Dukeof Marlborough and brought back news of the relief of Brussels in November. At the 1708 British general election, he was returned as a Whig MP for both Marlborough and Northumberland and chose to sit at Northumberland. He became a Colonel of the 15th Foot in 1709, and was returned in the subsequent by-election. He acted as a teller for the Whigs on several occasions and voted for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell in 1710. At the 1710 British general election he was returned again as Whig MP for Northumberland. He was appointed Governor of Tynemouth Castle by Robert Harley in 1711 and was also appointed a justice of the peace for Northumberland. In Parliament he voted for the motion of ‘No Peace without Spain’ on 7 December 1711. He was returned again for Northumberland at the 1713 British general election and spoke strongly in support of Richard Steele, voting against his expulsion. In 1714 he was appointed Groom of the Bedchamber to the Prince of Wales. \nSeymour was returned unopposed as Whig MP for Northumberland at the 1715 British general election and proposed Spencer Compton as Speaker on 17 March 1715. He also became Colonel of the 2nd Life Guards. He moved for the impeachment of Lord Kenmure, a rebel lord, in January 1716 and voted against the Government on Lord Cadogan in June 1717. When there was a break in relations between George I and his son Frederick, Prince of Wales later in 1717 he resigned his post as Groom of the Bedchamber to the Prince. He was returned again unopposed at the 1722 British general election. On 16 October 1722 took the chair at a committee of the whole House on the bill to suspend the Habeas Corpus Act. On his mother's death on 23 November 1722 he was summoned to the House of Lords as Lord Percy and vacated his seat in the House of Commons.\n\nPercy was Custos Rotulorum of Wiltshire from 1726 to 1750. He became a Brigadier-general in 1727 and in the same year was appointed Governor of Minorca, a post he held until 1742. He was promoted to Major-general in 1735 and to Lieutenant-general in 1739. From 1740 to 1750 he was Colonel of the Royal Horse Guards and then served as Governor of Guernsey from 1742 to 1750. In 1748 he succeeded his father as Duke of Somerset.\n\nThe Duke's only son Lord Beauchamp died unmarried in 1744, aged 19 (see below). In 1748 Somerset was created Baron Warkworth, of Warkworth Castle in the County of Northumberland, and Earl of Northumberland, with remainder to his son-in-law, Sir Hugh Smithson, 4th Baronet, with the intention that the majority of the Percy estates should descend in this line. He was at the same time created Baron of Cockermouth, in the County of Cumberland, and Earl of Egremont, with remainder to his nephews, Sir Charles Wyndham, 4th Baronet, of Orchard Wyndham, and Percy Wyndham-O'Brien, a revival of the Egremont title held by an earlier member of the Percy family, Thomas Percy, 1st Baron Egremont.\n\nIn March 1715, Somerset married Frances Thynne, daughter of Henry Thynne (1675–1708) and granddaughter of Thomas Thynne, 1st Viscount Weymouth. This Thomas Thynne was the first cousin of \"Tom of ten thousand\", who had been the second husband of Algernon's own mother, Elizabeth. Somerset and Frances had two children:\n\n\nSomerset died in 1750 and was buried in the Northumberland Vault, within Westminster Abbey. He was one of the richest landowners in England, but as he died with no surviving son his estates were split after his death. The ducal title passed to a distant cousin, Edward Seymour, 8th Duke of Somerset. The earldom of Northumberland and most of the traditional Percy estates passed to his daughter and her husband (see Alnwick Castle, Northumberland House and Syon House). Petworth in Sussex passed to the duke's nephew Charles Wyndham, 2nd Earl of Egremont. Later dukes of Somerset lived at Maiden Bradley, a far more modest estate than those already mentioned, and for a short while at Stover House, Teigngrace, Devon and at Berry Pomeroy, Devon.\n"}
