Scott, Trish Van Devere, and Melvyn Douglas. Its plot follows an esteemed New York City composer who relocates to Seattle, where he moves into a mansion he comes to believe is haunted. The screenplay is based upon events that writer Russell Hunter claimed he experienced while he was living in the Henry Treat Rogers mansion in the Cheesman Park neighborhood of Denver, Colorado, in the late 1960s; Hunter served as a co-writer of the film.\n\nThe film premiered at the USA Film Festival in Dallas,Texas on March 26, 1980, and was released simultaneously in Canada and the United States two days later. It received positive critical reviews, and was an early Canadian-produced film to have major success internationally. The film won eight inaugural Genie Awards, including Best Motion Picture, and was nominated for two Saturn Awards. It is considered one of the best horror films of all time, and one of the most influential Canadian films of all time.\n\nJohn Russell, a composer from New York City, moves to Seattle, Washington, following the deaths of his wife and daughter in a traffic accident while on a winter vacation upstate. He rents a large and eerie Victorian mansion from an agent of the local historic society, Claire Norman, who tells him that the property has been vacant for 12 years.\n\nNot long after moving in, John begins to experience unexplained phenomena, starting with a loud banging every morning. One night, he discovers all of the water taps turned on and sees the apparition of a drowned boy in a bathtub. Soon after a red stained glass window pane shatters as he is outside and, upon investigation, he finds a locked, boarded up door in a closet leading to a hidden attic bedroom. He takes a music box from the mantle and discovers it plays the exact piano tune he has just recorded downstairs. Claire and John investigate the history of the house, believing that the ghost is that of a young girl killed outside the house in a traffic accident in 1909. John holds a seance and overhears the voice of the spirit on audio equipment, calling himself Joseph Carmichael.\n\nJohn discovers that Joseph was a crippled and sickly six-year-old who was murdered in 1906 by his father Richard because he was unlikely to reach the age of 21, upon which he would have inherited an enormous fortune from his late grandfather. To ensure the inheritance, Richard replaced the dead boy with one procured from a local orphanage and spirited him away to Europe under the pretense of seeking treatment for his condition. After years away, he returned with the boy when he was 18, claiming that he was cured. The boy is now an old man, a prominent U.S. Senator who is also a major patron of the historical society that owns the house.\n\nJohn's investigation leads him to a property that was once owned by the Carmichael family, where he believes the body of the real Joseph Carmichael was dumped in a well. There, he finds the skeleton of a young child with his christening medal. He attempts to speak to Senator Carmichael but is restrained. The Senator is disturbed to see the medal, as it is identical to the one in his possession. The society cancels John's lease on the house and fires Claire. Carmichael sends a detective, DeWitt, to John's home in an attempt to intimidate him and retrieve the medal. John refuses, and when DeWitt leaves to obtain a search warrant, his vehicle mysteriously crashes, killing him.\n\nAfter DeWitt's death, the Senator agrees to meet with John, who tells him the story. The Senator refuses to believe it and angrily berates John for accusing his father (who he claims was a \"loving man\") of murder. John leaves the real Joseph's medal, files and only copy of the seance recording, and apologizes. Claire goes to the house to find John and is chased by Joseph's wheelchair until she falls down the stairs. John arrives and the house begins to shake. He tries to appease Joseph's ghost but falls from the second storey, and Joseph lights the house on fire. Simultaneously, the Senator compares the two medals, realizing the truth, before he falls into a trance staring at the portrait of his father. John witnesses the Senator's astral body climbing the burning stairs to Joseph's room. Claire rescues John, while the Senator witnesses the murder of the real Joseph and suffers a fatal heart attack. John and Claire see the Senator's body being loaded into the ambulance.\n\nThe next morning, Joseph's burnt wheelchair sits amid the ruins of the mansion and his music box begins playing a lullaby.\n\n\nThe film's screenplay was inspired by mysterious events that allegedly took place at the Henry Treat Rogers mansion in Cheesman Park, Denver, Colorado, while playwright Russell Hunter was living there during the 1960s. After experiencing a series of unexplained phenomena, Hunter said he found a century-old journal in a hidden room detailing the life of a disabled boy who was kept in isolation by his parents. During a séance, he claimed, the spirit of a deceased boy directed him to another house, where he discovered human remains and a gold medallion bearing the dead boy’s name. Henry Treat Rogers, a wealthy Denver attorney, was childless; but prior inhabitants of the house remain undocumented. The mansion was demolished during the 1980s and replaced with a high-rise apartment building.\n\nWhile \"The Changeling\" is set in Seattle, most of its scenes were filmed in the Canadian cities of Vancouver and Victoria, and their environs. Exceptions include introductory location shooting in New York City and establishing shots of Seattle points of interest, including SeaTac Airport, University of Washington's Red Square, the Space Needle, the Rainier Tower, and the Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge. Interior college scenes were shot at the University of Toronto. The Historical Society was Vancouver's historic Hotel Europe. The senator's home was Hatley Castle on the grounds of Royal Roads Military College (now Royal Roads University) in Victoria. Exterior shots of Russell's home were filmed using a facade, erected in front of an existing home in South Vancouver. The haunted mansion's interior was a series of interconnected sets at Panorama Studios in West Vancouver.\n\nPeter Medak was the third director hired for the project. His predecessors, Donald Cammell and Tony Richardson, both withdrew due to \"creative differences\". Medak was hired with only a month to facilitate script re-writes and set construction.\n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" wrote in his review of the film: \"If it only took craftsmanship to make a haunted house movie, \"The Changeling\" would be a great one. It has all the technical requirements, beginning with the haunted house itself... [the film] does have some interesting ideas... But it doesn't have that sneaky sense of awful things about to happen. Scott makes the hero so rational, normal and self-possessed that we never feel he's in real danger; we go through this movie with too much confidence.\" Edwin Miller of \"Seventeen\" wrote that the film was a \"visually classy chiller... aided by stunning film locations.\" Richard Grenier of \"Cosmopolitan\" praised Medak's direction, but added: \"it is Scott, using the full range of his immense talent, who gives the story its spine-tingling impact,\" and deemed it the best horror film of the year. \"Variety\" also praised the film, noting it as a \"superior haunted house thriller.\"\n\nEd Blank of the \"Pittsburgh Press\" referred to the film as \"an unexceptional but diverting horror story with better-than-average performers.\" A review published in \"Florida Today\" praised the film as \"the best ghost story of the year,\" noting Medak's direction as \"brilliant,\" and likening it to \"The Innocents\". \"The Arizona Republic\"s Michael Maza wrote a less favorable review, calling the film \"a sure-thing haunted house story\" and \"routine picture\" supplemented with \"formulaic eerie noises, cobwebbed stairways, crashing glassware and unbelievable coincidences.\" In \"The Morning News\", the film was noted as a \"good ghost story... George C. Scott's demonic energy works well for him here, giving a force and power that might elude a weaker actor. Trish Vandevere is appealing in the role of the historic society woman and Melvyn Douglas is superb as a crusty old millionaire.\"\n\nFiona Ferguson of \"Time Out\" was critical of the plot, noting: \"the leaps made by Scott's agile mind in identifying both victim and usurper leave logic and credence on the starting block.\" Film 4 noted the film as \"a minor classic\" and \"underrated member of the haunted house movie genre.\"\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, \"The Changeling\" holds a 83% approval rating based on 23 reviews, with an average rating of 7.49/10. The consensus reads: \"George C. Scott's somber performance gives this haunted house horror a moving soul to go along with its harrowing scares.\"\n\nThe film was released on LaserDisc with a digital Stereo soundtrack by HBO Videos in 1982. The film was also released on DVD by HBO Home Video in 2000. The independent distributor Severin Films announced a limited edition Blu-ray release of the film, which was released in the United States on August 7, 2018.\n\n\"The Changeling\" won the first ever Genie Award for Best Canadian Film. It also won the following Genie Awards:\n\nThis film was No. 54 on Bravo's \"100 Scariest Movie Moments\".\nDirector Martin Scorsese placed \"The Changeling\" on his list of the 11 scariest horror films of all time.\n\nThe Soundtrack to \"The Changeling\" was released by Percepto Records on CD on December 21, 2001 and was limited to 1,000 copies. On April 13, 2007, Percepto released a 2-CD \"Deluxe Edition\" of the soundtrack, which was also limited to 1,000 copies and has subsequently been sold out.\n\nMusic from the film also included:\n\nIn 1987, Italian director Lamberto Bava directed \"Until Death\", an unofficial made-for-television film that was marketed as a sequel for its home video releases; however, there is no connection between the films.\n\n\n\n"}

Those head shots are intended for helping them land a career, an actor headshot should help casting directors understand the person exactly as he or she is (ie. age group & ethnic background), while the actor hopes that the headshot will inspire the casting director to hire him or her. Head shots often feature the actor or actress facing off-center. A performer will often have head shots expressing different poses and expressions to give a potential employer an idea of the subject's range of appearances or expressions. These types of head shots are called \"looks\". It is common for an actor to have different head shots for different roles, but for the most part these consist of a change in attire. The head shots that include a person's shoulders are called \"three-quarter\" shots. Previously, head shots were often in black-and-white; however, most head shots are now taken in color.\n\nActors' head shots, when they are printed and not simply uploaded online to an industry database, are done in an 8\"×10\" format. Other promotional images, for example, press shots and lobby prints, may be in many different aspect ratios. Acting head shots are often not photographic prints, instead they are typically printed via a lithographic or laser process.\n\nThe main purpose of an actor's head shot is identification. Therefore, the most important feature of an actor's head shot is that it represents the subject. Theatrical head shots are usually very \"neutral\" looking shots of the actor and clearly show their facial features.\nHead shots are intended to show a person as they currently appear and reflect their best qualities. Therefore, if an actor's hair has been recently cut or colored, they would often get a new head shot to reflect their new image. Additionally, if an actor has a scar or facial blemish, it is expected to be visible on the head shot and not digitally removed from the image. Pimples or spots are temporary and, therefore, are usually digitally retouched.\n\nModeling head shots or comp cards, sometimes also called tear sheets, are a compilation of images for casting in one sheet with a résumé of work, name and relevant statistics. They are often done in color; however, in some jurisdictions, such as the UK, they may be in black-and-white. Models often use them for castings and modeling work applications. A close-up head shot is often required to show a model's skin complexion for beauty work.\n\nModeling head shots are usually used for:\n\nModels' head shots are also often professionally retouched to ensure their close-up beauty photograph appears perfect without blemishes or spots.\n\nComp cards are one of the cornerstones of a model's “marketing materials”. They are about 5½×8” and printed on both sides. Almost all \ncomp cards are in color but may include black-and-white images. A model may have four to five images on the comp card and at least one of these images will be a head shot.\n\n"}

Additionally, he played third base for his American Legion baseball team, which won a state championship in the summer of 2002.\n\nMcPherson played two seasons (2001–02) at Florida State University. As a sophomore in 2002, he started four games, completing 80 of 156 passes for 1,017 yards, 12 touchdowns and one interception. He also rushed for 180 yards on 48 carries. As a true freshman he had appeared in nine games with the Seminoles in 2001, completing 23 of 37 passes for 214 yards and two touchdowns.\n\n\"Source\":\n\nAfter a jury found McPherson not guilty, he tried to enroll at Tennessee State but when it became clear the NCAA would not allow him to play collegiate sports, he chose to turn pro and sign with the Indiana Firebirds of the Arena Football League, where he threw 61 touchdowns and only 5 interceptions, and ran for 19 touchdowns. Because of his exceptional play, he was named the 2004 AFL Rookie of the Year. He could have opted for the 2004 NFL Draft or a Supplemental Draft but chose to pay his dues in the AFL and prove to the NFL that he had matured.\n\nLater that spring McPherson was selected by the New Orleans Saints in the fifth round of the 2005 NFL Draft.\n\nOn August 12, 2006, McPherson was hit by a golf cart driven by the Tennessee Titans mascot during half-time. On December 8, 2006, he sued the Titans because of the accident that occurred during the pre-season game at LP Field. The suit sought $15 million in punitive damages and $5 million in compensatory damages.\n\nBefore McPherson signed with the Saints following the 2005 NFL Draft, he was acquired from the Indiana Firebirds by the new Utah Blaze of the AFL in their 2005 expansion draft. The move was widely considered to be a gamble, considering his unknown status before the NFL's 2005 Draft. Following the NFL draft, McPherson was placed by the AFL on the \"other-league exempt list\" until further notice.\n\nFinally on November 9, 2006, McPherson was activated by the AFL and a week later traded to the Austin Wranglers in exchange for future considerations.\n\nMcPherson was signed by the Grand Rapids Rampage in 2007 as a back-up quarterback for Chad Salsbury. That season for the Rampage, he completed 76 of 129 passes for 819 yards and nine touchdowns with four interceptions.\n\nIn 2008, McPherson went 27-for-50 for 368 yards and four touchdowns with no interceptions. He was released by the team in April.\n\nIn May 2008, McPherson was signed by the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League. He debuted with the Alouettes in a CFL pre-season game, on June 12, 2008, against the Toronto Argonauts. He completed four of eight passes for 105 yards, and one touchdown pass. The Alouettes and Argonauts played to a 34-34 tie in Montreal. McPherson spent five seasons as the back up to franchise quarterback Anthony Calvillo, winning the Grey Cup in 2009 and 2010. Two weeks before entering free agency, McPherson was released on February 1, 2013 so that he could pursue offers from other teams.\n\nOn February 19, 2013, McPherson signed with the Tampa Bay Storm.

Two months later McPherson's season ended with a right leg injury.\n\nIn January 2014, McPherson was signed by the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League.\n\nOn October 28, 2014, McPherson was assigned to the Los Angeles KISS of the AFL.\n\nAfter recovering from an injury that he received during his tenure with the LA KISS, McPherson was signed by the Toronto Argonauts on June 13, 2015. However, one year later, he was released by the Argonauts (on Wednesday, June 15, 2016). On July 20, 2016, he was re-signed by the Argonauts; but on August 27, 2016, he was released again.\n\nMcPherson signed with the Jacksonville Sharks in April 2018.

Locations of the camps included Strzałkowo, Pikulice, Wadowice, and Tuchola.\n\nDue to epidemics raging at the time, made worse by the very bad sanitary conditions in which the prisoners were held, largely due to overcrowding, between 16,000 and 20,000 Soviet soldiers held in the Polish POW camps died, out of the total of 80,000 to 85,000 prisoners.\n\nDuring the Polish-Soviet War, between 80,000-85,000 Soviet soldiers became prisoners of war, and were held in Polish POW camps. The conditions in these camps were bad, as the newly recreated Polish state was led by strong nationalists who looked vengefully at the Russians and considered they deserve no better treatment. Furthermore, the state lacked many basic capabilities and had few resources to construct them. Thus, the existing camps, many of which were adapted from World War I German and Russian facilities or constructed by the prisoners themselves, were not adequate for holding the large number of prisoners, who suffered from hunger, bad sanitation and inadequate hygiene. Between 16,000-17,000 (Polish figures) and 18,000-20,000 (Russian figures) died, mostly as a result of harsh conditions and epidemics which raged in the camps. Before publications of new findings in Russia in 2004, some Russian sources gave much-inflated numbers for prisoners and the death toll (up to 165,000 and 70,000), respectively. This matter caused much controversy between Poland and Russia.\n\nDuring a war between two countries experiencing great socioeconomic difficulties, and often unable to provide adequately for their own populations, the treatment of prisoners of war was far from adequate.\n\nThe bad conditions in these camps were known to public opinion in Poland at the time, as a number of Polish newspapers openly wrote about them, criticizing the government for not correcting the situation. In modern times the issue has been addressed in a number of scholarly publications.\n\nThe issue of the actual number of prisoners and their estimated death toll was settled long after the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe. A joint team of Polish and Russian historians published results of their findings in 2004, after reexamining documents from the Polish and Russian archives. The commission included Prof. Waldemar Rezmer and Prof. Zbigniew Karpus from Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń as well as Prof. Gennady Matveyev from the Moscow State University. Their research revealed that the number of Russian POWs can be estimated at between 80,000 and 85,000, and that the number of deaths in the camps can be estimated between 16,000 (Karpus, Rezmer) and 20,000 (Matveyev). Existing documents disprove the allegations by Soviet ideologues, that the Russian POWs were exterminated. The prisoners' nationality, religion or other issues had no bearing on their POW status. The archives prove that the cause of death were epidemics of influenza, typhus, cholera and dysentery. Infectious diseases took a heavy toll on active soldiers and the civilian population as well. The Russian representative in the commission, Matveyev, rejected the joint statement two years later in 2006 increasing the number of prisoners by 40 percent.\n\nUntil the source documents were published in Moscow in 2004, some Russian historians had estimated the number of prisoners and the death toll to be much higher, estimating that the death toll ranged from 40,000 to more than 100,000. For example, Irina Mikhutina in her 1995 publications estimated the number of prisoners to be 165,000 and the death toll to be 70,000. In 1998 Russian popular press reported that Polish internment camp in Tuchola was particularly notorious for the large number of Soviet POW's deaths and was dubbed a \"death camp\" by the Russian Emigrant press from within Poland. There have also been accusations from the Russian side that the death toll was influenced by the indifference of the camp authorities. Other historians have also noted that Russian historians used those numbers to justify the World War II Katyn massacre of Polish officers and intelligentsia by the NKVD. Such usage has become known as \"Anti-Katyn\".\n\nThe Russian historians arrived at this number by first estimating the number of POWs, then subtracting the number that has been repatriated to the Soviet Union after the hostilities ended, and then assuming that most of the remainder died in POW camps. Polish historians always countered this by arguing that: (a) the number of POWs was very difficult to estimate accurately, due to the chaotic situation prevailing for most of the war, and (b) many Soviet POWs lost that status after they switched sides and entered units fighting alongside Polish forces against the Red Army, or were transferred to the Whites rather than the Bolsheviks. There was also the problem that significant number of Russian POWs were left in the territory of Poland since World War I (about 3.9 million soldiers of the Russian Empire were taken captive by the Central Powers) and obviously when the Polish-Soviet conflict deteriorated, these POWs were not released to Russia.\n\nAccording to Polish historians Karpus and Alexandrowicz, similar number of Polish POWs died in Soviet and Lithuanian camps from 1919 to 1922 – about 20,000 out of about 51,000 captured.\n\nAfter 1922 the Polish and Russian prisoners were also exchanged among two sides. Ekaterina Peshkova, the chairwoman of organization \"Assistance to Political Prisoners\" (Pompolit, \"Помощь политическим заключенным\", Помполит), was awarded an order of Polish Red Cross for her participation in the exchange of POWs after the Polish-Soviet War.\n\nDuring the memorial ceremony for the victims of the Katyn massacre on April 7, 2010, attended by the Russian and Polish Prime Ministers Vladimir Putin and Donald Tusk, Putin said that, in his private opinion, Stalin (whose refusal to obey orders from the Kremlin resulted in the Russian defeat against Poland in 1920) felt personally responsible for this tragedy, and carried out the executions of Polish officers in Katyn in 1940 out of a sense of revenge.\n\nThe Russian Society of Military History called for a Kraków memorial of the Russian victims.\n\nIn 2014, the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs published further archival documents of International Red Cross and League of Nations missions that inspected the camps. The newly published documents are mostly in French and English.\n\n\n"}

It was formed in 1988 by an act of the Parliament of India.\n\nIt provides security only to the Prime Minister of India and their immediate family members residing with them at the official residence.\n\nEarlier, it used to provide security to former prime ministers as well but now Z+ security cover has been given to them.\n\nBefore 1981, the security of the Prime Minister at the official residence was the responsibility of the Special Security District of the Delhi Police under the charge of Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP). In October 1981, a Special Task Force (STF) was raised by the Intelligence Bureau (IB) to provide ring-round and escort to the Prime Minister in and out of New Delhi.\n\nAfter the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in October 1984, a review was undertaken by a Committee of Secretaries and it was decided to entrust security of the Prime Minister to a Special Group under unitary and direct control of a designated Officer and the STF to provide immediate security cover both in New Delhi and outside. These decisions were taken as short-term measures.\n\nThen on 18 February 1985, the Ministry of Home Affairs set up the \"Birbal Nath Committee\" to go into the issue in its entirety and submit its recommendation. In March 1985, the \"Birbal Nath Committee\" submitted its recommendations of raising a Special Protection Unit (SPU). On 30 March 1985, the President of India created 819 posts for the unit under the Cabinet Secretariat. The SPU was then re-christened \"Special Protection Group\" and the post of Inspector General of Police was re-designated as Director.\n\nThe SPG came into being on 8 April 1985 when S. Subramaniam, then Joint Director (VIP Security) in the Intelligence Bureau assumed office. Creation of the SPG required an elaborate exercise in order to clearly delineate responsibility of various agencies concerned with the security of the Prime Minister. The provisions contained in the \"Blue Book\", which lays down security guidelines for the protection of the Prime Minister, had to be harmoniously blended with this new concept of proximate security.\n\nIB and the State/UT Police concerned were responsible for coordination, collection and dissemination of intelligence affecting VIP security. State/UT Police and the SPG were responsible for providing physical security arrangements for the Prime Minister, while the IB was to provide the required intelligence inputs to these operational agencies. The SPG functioned as a security group purely on the strength of an Executive Order for three years without a legislation, from April 1985 to June 1988.\n\nThe SPG was constituted and trained specially to provide protection to Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, in view of the threats to him from several sources. But, the organization created for the proximate security of Prime Minister Gandhi, did not contemplate provision of protection to him when he ceased to be Prime Minister, and faced magnified threats. SPG cover for Rajiv Gandhi was withdrawn once he ceased to be Prime Minister. After the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi in May 1991, the \"SPG Act\" was amended in 1991 to provide security to former Prime Ministers and their immediate families for a period of 10 years from the date on which the former Prime Minister ceased to hold office.\n\nOn 27 November 2019, SPG amendment bill 2019 was passed by Lower House of Indian Parliament, which reduced SPG cover only to the PM and his immediate kin, and ex-PM and his family for 5 years. The ACT seeks to bring down the cost of maintaining the SPG security to the exchequer. \n\nThe \"general superintendence, direction and control\" of the SPG is exercised by the Central Government. The head of the force, called a Director, designated as Secretary in the Cabinet Secretariat is responsible for \"the command and supervision\" of the force. The director of the SPG since its inception has been an officer from the Indian Police Service. Personnel of the Special Protection Group are drawn from Central Armed Police Forces and Railway Protection Force, but the officers are from the IPS or officers of the RPF.\nThe Director of the \"SPG\", an officer of Director General, designated as Secretary (Security) in the Cabinet Secretariat, and sometimes Inspector General rank, designated as Joint Secretary (Security) in the Cabinet Secretariat, is assisted by number of Deputy Directors, Assistant Directors, Joint Assistant Directors. The SPG is divided broadly into the following four categories:\n\nGenerally, SPG Special Agents assigned to the Prime Ministerial Security Detail wear black Western-style formal business suits, with dark sunglasses, a 2-way encrypted communication earpiece, and concealed handguns. Rarely, on traditional occasions, they wear safari suits to blend into the environment.\n\nSPG Uniformed Officers are dressed like Special operations commandos, with much more noticeable armament. Their personal equipment include ultra-modern assault rifles, dark-visor goggles/sunglasses with inbuilt communication earpieces, bulletproof vests, gloves and elbow/knee pads.\n\nNarendra Modi, being the Prime Minister of India, is under the SPG protection. Sonia Gandhi and her children, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi, were given the SPG protection because, two of their family members, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, both former Prime Ministers of India, were assassinated. On 8 November 2019, Government of India decided to withdraw SPG Cover from Nehru–Gandhi family and accorded them with Z+ Security after the threat assessment.\n\n\nThe Prime Minister's motorcade comprises a fleet of vehicles, the core of which consists of at least three armoured BMW 7 Series sedans, two armoured Range Rovers, at least 8-10 BMW X5s, six Toyota Fortuners/Land Cruisers and at least two Mercedes-Benz Sprinter ambulances. A Tata Safari ECM car also accompanies the convoy, besides many more escort vehicles.\n\n\nThese customized armoured variants of the standard 2015 BMW 760Li long-wheelbase sedan are used to transport the Prime Minister. They are certified with VR7 in the BRV 2009 ballistics protection ratings, and can defend occupants from anything between landmine blasts and machine-gun fire. Security upgrades include undercarriage armour, 76 mm (3 in) thick multi-layer laminated glass and armour plating on the doors, roof, body pillars, front footwell and rear bulkhead. They have run-flat tyres which can run deflated for kilometers. The cars are fitted with advanced heat sensors to ward off missiles and bombs. While the fuel tanks are Kevlar-sealed so as not to explode during an attack, their cabins also turn into gas-proof chambers and ensure fresh oxygen supply to secure the occupants in cases of chemical and biological attacks. Other rumoured features include an intercom system between the passengers and the driver, an alarm, a fire extinguisher with temperature sensor, irritant gas sensors (to warn of dangerous gasses in the passenger area), and a compartment for two machine guns in the center console. Due to the added weight of the security upgrades, suspension components such as the shock absorbers and strut tops are upgraded as compared to a normal 760Li.\n\nFor official movement, the Indian flag is fender-mounted on the driver's side of the vehicles, and if taken abroad, the flag of the foreign country is fender-mounted on the passenger's side.\n\n\nThese armoured variants of the standard wheelbase 2016 Range Rover Autobiography SUV are used as backup to the BMW 760Li sedans for transportation of the Prime Minister. If not being used by the Prime Minister himself/herself, they are used to transport members of the Prime Minister's immediate family accompanying him/her as part of the motorcade. These SUVs are armoured by Land Rover's Special Vehicle Operations facility in Coventry, England, and are certified with VR8 in the BRV 2009 ballistics protection ratings. They can withstand some of the most damaging and targeted of threats, including penetration by 7.62mm high velocity armour piercing incendiary bullets, they can protect occupants against up to 15 kg lateral Trinitrotoluene (TNT) blasts and defend against DM51 grenade explosions from both beneath the floor and above the sunroof. Run-flat tyres allow the vehicle to be driven even if the tyres are deflated. The chassis is reinforced with super-high-strength steel, and the standard glass has been replaced by multi-laminated armoured privacy glass of optical quality. The suspension is upgraded as compared to the standard Range Rover, while an anti-tamper exhaust, self-sealing fuel tank, auxiliary back-up battery and split-charging battery system provide added protection and security.\n\nJust like the BMW 760Li's, the Indian flag is fender-mounted on the driver's side of the vehicles. However, these SUVs, even if taken abroad, do not bear the flag of the foreign country, and will instead have the Indian flag itself or a flag with the State Emblem of India fender-mounted on the passenger's side.\n\n\nThese SUVs carry the SPG Special Agents and Uniformed Officers assigned to the Prime Ministerial Security Detail. At least 8 BMW X5s, 6 Fortuners and 2 Land Cruisers accompany the motorcade at all times. The X5s in particular are armoured to VR6 in the BRV 2009 ratings, but the protection levels on the Toyota SUVs are undisclosed.\n\n\nThese are armoured tactical medical support vehicles to the Prime Minister, at least two of which are always spotted to the rear of the motorcade. They carry at least a litre of the Prime Minister's blood type, for emergency transfusions.\n\n\nThis vehicle is used to counter guided attacks, such as IEDs, Rocket Propelled Grenades, and Anti-Tank Guided Missiles. The antennas mounted on the roof are solely used in barrage jamming applications, the primary method used to counter IED threats. The antenna configuration can be changed according to threat level, for instance, taller antennas are used to increase the jamming protection distance, or change jamming frequency ranges. There are two dome-shaped EW Sensors. The EW sensors are millimetre-wave radars used to detect the launch of an RPG (Rocket Propelled Grenades) or laser range finder illumination and launch of an Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM).\n\n\n\nMembers of the SPG are barred by the SPG Act, 1988, from contact with the media and from publishing or collaborating in the publication of \"any book, letter or other document\".\n\n\n"}

In 1988, Whitney began working at Morgan Stanley developing financial applications. At Morgan Stanley, Whitney developed A+ to facilitate migrating APL applications from IBM mainframe computers to a network of Sun Microsystems workstations. A+ had a smaller set of primitive functions and was designed for speed, and to handle large sets of time series data.\n\nIn 1993, Whitney left Morgan Stanley and co-founded Kx Systems with Janet Lustgarten, to commercialize his k programming language. According to Paul Ford's 2015 cover-story for \"Businessweek\", k is a programming language that is \"famous for its brevity.\" The company signed an exclusive agreement with Union Bank of Switzerland and Whitney developed a variety of trading applications using k until the contract expired. At the outset of the contract Whitney developed the kdb database built on k. In 2003, Kx Systems released q, a new vector language that built upon k and the kdb+ database developed by Whitney.\n\nIn 2018, First Derivatives bought out Whitney and Lustgarten's minority shares of Kx Systems. Whitney and Lustgarten then founded Shakti.\n\nThe Shakti platform has a small memory footprint, and allows for fast deployment and processing of distributed elastic workloads.

Its mainstage performances occur in the Queen Elizabeth Theatre, other venues in Vancouver and occasionally elsewhere in British Columbia. Vancouver Opera has one of only two professional opera orchestras in Canada (the other being Toronto’s Canadian Opera Company). After many regular seasons with four mainstage productions a year, the company will see its first festival season in 2017. Vancouver Opera also runs a school touring and education program, and various community events.\n\nVancouver Opera was founded in 1958 by William Morton and presented its first production in 1960. From its inception until 1974, and for two seasons from 1982 to 1984, the company was headed by Artistic Director Irving Guttman.\n\nThe company has presented five world premières: The Architect (McIntyre and Cone), Naomi's Road (Luengen and Hodges), Jack Pine (Hille), Lillian Alling (Estacio and Murrell), and Stickboy (Weisensel and Koyzcan). It produced the Canadian première of John Adams's Nixon in China (2010) and Tan Dun's Tea: A Mirror of Soul (2013).\n\nConductor Richard Bonynge served as Artistic Director from 1974 to 1982, and he was the founding Music Director of the Vancouver Opera Orchestra, one of only two opera orchestras in Canada, in the moment of its creation in 1977 (prior to 1977, opera productions were played by and orchestra made up of members of Vancouver Symphony Orchestra). In 1984, Brian McMaster began a five-year tenure. He was followed by Guus Mostart for three seasons (1989–90, 1990–91 and 1991–92), and by Robert Hallam, who in 1991 was appointed to the new position of General Director.\n\nThe company's current General Director, Tom Wright, assumed the position in November 2019 as Interim General Director, and was confirmed as General Director in April 2020. Vancouver Opera's Music Director Emeritus is Jonathan Darlington, who has led the company's musical forces since 2002.\n"}

It is located 135 km to the south of Concepción. Cañete is known as a \"Historic City\" (Spanish: \"ciudad histórica\") as it is one of the oldest cities in country. The Battle of Tucapel and Pedro de Valdivia's death happened near the city's current location. Cañete was also an important location in the Arauco War.\n\nCañete was founded under the name of \"Cañete de la Frontera\" in 1558. The city was established by Governor García Hurtado de Mendoza and named in honor of his father, Andrés Hurtado de Mendoza, 3rd Marquis of Cañete. The marquis' title originated from the Castile town Cañete.\n\nThe area was known as Tucapel, meaning \"taking by force\" in Mapudungun. In October 1553, Pedro de Valdivia founded the Fort Tucapel, next to the present city of Cañete. Two months later, native Mapuches destroyed the fort. Valdivia returned on 25 December 1553, to rebuild the fort, but the Spanish army was once again defeated in the Battle of Tucapel, an early battle in the Arauco War. Valdivia was captured and killed.\n\nIn January 1558, Governor García Hurtado de Mendoza founded the city as \"Cañete de la Frontera\" three kilometers to the west of the present location of the city. Hurtado de Mendoza named Alonso de Reinoso as corregidor of the Corregimiento of Cañete. The Mapuches, led by Caupolican, besieged the city, but they were defeated in the battle of the Fort of Cañete.\n\nSubsequent military defeats forced governor Francisco de Villagra to abandon the city in January 1563. Three years later, a new city was started under the orders of Rodrigo de Quiroga but it did not prosper either due to constant attacks by the Mapuches.\n\nThe present city was founded on 12 November 1868 by colonel Cornelio Saavedra Rodríguez as part of the pacification of Araucanía.\n\nOn 12 November 2006 a major car accident occurred near Canete when a bus with 28 people fell into the River Tucapel and 19 passengers died. 17 of the victims were soldiers who were members of the band Reinforced Regiment No. 7 \"Chacabuco\" Concepción. The group was traveling to a celebration for the anniversary of the founding of Cañete. The press titled the accident \"\"tragedy of Cañete\",\" like the tragedy of Antuco. President Michelle Bachelet, the minister of National Defense Vivianne Blanlot and Commander-in-Chief Óscar Izurieta traveled to Concepción for the funerals.\n\nThe 2010 Chilean earthquake caused major damage to the city. The Kallvu Llanka hospital, which was being constructed, was severely impacted, delaying its opening from 8 October 2010 till 22 October 2013.\n\nAccording to the National Statistics Institute's 2002 census, Cañete spans over an area of and has 31,270 inhabitants (15,625 men and 15,645 women). 63.4% (19,839) live in urban areas and 36.6% (11,431) reside in rural areas. The population grew by 6.6% (1,947 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses.\n\nProjections indicated that the population in 2009 was 33,535 inhabitants.\n\nCañete is a commune, the smallest administrative subdivision in Chile. It is a third-level administrative division administered by a municipal council, headed by an alcalde (mayor) who is directly elected by the public every four years and leading a six-member council. The municipality of Cañete is a member of the Association of Municipalities of the Arauco Province, also known as Arauco 7.\n\nWithin the electoral divisions of Chile, Cañete is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Manuel Monsalve (PS) and Iván Norambuena (UDI) as part of the 46th electoral district, (together with Lota, Lebu, Arauco, Curanilahue, Los Álamos, Contulmo and Tirúa). The commune is represented in the Senate by Víctor Pérez Varela (UDI) and Felipe Harboe Bascuñán (PPD) as part of the 13th senatorial constituency (Biobío-Coast).\n\nLas Misiones Airport is located in northern Cañete.\n\nThe city also has several bus terminals downtown, including Pedro de Valdivia terminal, Jeldres terminal, and Biobio-Jota Ewert terminal. Intercity buses run to Santiago, Concepción, and Temuco.\n\nCañete has 34 primary and secondary schools, of which 24 are public. Top schools include Liceo Gabriela Mistral, Instituto San José and Liceo B-56. Higher education institutions include the Technological Institute of the Catholic University of the Most Holy Conception and the CFT Lota Arauco of the University of Concepción.\n\nThe Intercultural Hospital Kallvu Llanka (Mapudungun for \"The Universe's Jewel\") is located on route P-60-R, in northern Cañete. It offers traditional medicine while channeling and honoring mapuche culture through aspects such a circular waiting rooms similar to rukas. The hospital was opened in 2013.\n\nThe Mapuche Museum of Cañete is located in the southern part of the city and has been open since 1968.\n\nEvery year, between January and February the Agricultural, Livestock and Forestry Fair of Cañete (Spanish: \"Feria Agrícola, Ganadera y Forestal,\" FAGAF) takes place on the Anike farm two kilometers from the city. The fair is considered the largest in the region and one of the most important agricultural events in Chile. It usually hosts more than one hundred exhibitors and features activities such as loose mare threshing, agricultural and forestry machinery exhibitions and gastronomy contests, amongst other activities. Additionally, the fair incorporates the local culture by showcasing Mapuche and Chilean farm traditions. Since 2015, the fair has been held in conjunction with Cañete Week which features singers, music groups and comedians.\n\nAnother event, the Farmer Fest of Cayucupil, takes place 14 km from the city center in a rural area.\n\nCañete is continuing to grow its film and entertainment presence. The Lebu International Film Festival is headquartered in the city. Also, Jorge Olguín's 2014 movie \"Whispers of the Forest\" was filmed around Cañete, mainly in Reussland Park and Morales Castle, 10 km north of the city.\n\n\n"}

Irwin (1869–1937).\n\n\"Irwin\" was launched 31 October 1943 by the Bethlehem Steel Co., San Pedro, California; sponsored by Mrs. Charles A. Lockwood, Jr., daughter of Admiral Irwin and wife of Vice Admiral Lockwood; and commissioned 14 February 1944, Commander Daniel B. Miller in command.\n\nFollowing shakedown, \"Irwin\" departed San Diego 26 April 1944 for Hawaii, thence to Eniwetok to stage for the invasion of the Marianas. She sailed 11 June in the screen of escort carriers providing air cover for the invasion of Saipan 15 June 1944. As the Japanese Mobile Fleet was turned back in defeat from the Marianas in the Battle of the Philippine Sea 19 to 21 June, \"Irwin\" shot down an enemy torpedo bomber while repelling air attacks on the escort carriers.\n\n\"Irwin\" bombarded the enemy on Saipan 21 to 29 June, guarded escort carriers covering the invasion of Tinian 23 July, then gave bombardment support to troops fighting on Guam. She next joined the screen of fast attack carriers hitting hard at enemy bases in the Palau Islands, along the coast of Luzon, Okinawa and Formosa. Off the latter enemy-held shore 14 October 1944, she shot down a torpedo bomber. She assisted in the escort of the bomb-damaged cruisers \"Houston\" (CL-81) and \"Canberra\" (CA-70) to safety, then again joined the screen of fast attack carriers giving direct air support to the liberation landings at Leyte, 20 October 1944.\n\nThe Japanese fleet made a three-pronged approach to the Philippines 24 October 1944 for the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Planes from \"Irwin\"'s carrier task group made destructive bombing runs on the Japanese Center Force of battleships and cruisers. But land-based Japanese bombers retaliated with heavy air strikes, scoring a lucky bomb hit on light carrier \"Princeton\" (CVL-23). In a heroic saga that brought \"Irwin\" the award of the Navy Unit Commendation, she braved raging flames, violent explosions, falling debris, and exploding shells as she went alongside \"Princeton\". Fighting dense black smoke in a choppy sea, she rigged hoses and fought fires in the forward part of the hangar deck. Later, when an explosion blew off the major portion of the carrier's stern, \"Irwin\" immediately dispatched boats and some of her men dove into choppy seas to rescue survivors. Two of the divers were Charles Edward Kahler and Bert Townsend Jr. who were designated strong swimmers aboard the Irwin. Though damaged herself, the destroyer stood at close quarters until she had rescued 646 men from the sea and from the decks of \"Princeton\".\n\n\"Irwin\" headed for Ulithi with \"Princeton\" survivors as the Japanese Southern Force was largely destroyed in the Battle of Surigao Strait, their carriers destroyed off Cape Engaño, and their powerful battleship-cruiser-destroyer bombardment force turned back in the Battle off Samar. From Ulithi she sailed for overhaul in the San Francisco Naval Shipyard (17 November 1944 – 23 January 1945). She then steamed for Hawaii, thence to the Marshalls and finally to Saipan, arriving 14 February 1945.\n\n\"Irwin\" helped screen attack carriers giving direct air support to the invasion of Iwo Jima, 19–23 February 1945. She was then assigned to Task Force 54 (TF 54) for the invasion of Okinawa, participating in the preinvasion bombardment of 27–31 March. As the Japanese air arm had been decimated by this point in the war, the lack of trained and experienced pilots led them to deploy their most extensive kamikaze attacks during this battle; \"Irwin\" fought off repeated attacks from kamikaze, in addition to attack planes, torpedo boats and suicide boats. On 30 March \"Irwin\" repelled three Japanese torpedo boats, sinking one, damaging another, and forcing the other to flee. As Marines stormed the shores of Okinawa 1 April 1945, she shot down a twin-engined bomber and rescued one enemy survivor from this victim. For 2 months, \"Irwin\" bombarded enemy artillery positions, machine gun emplacements, troop concentrations, caves and suicide boat hiding places. She shot down a suicide torpedo bomber 12 April 1945, and scored another kill the 16th as she covered the landings on Ie Shima. Another enemy suicide plane was shot down 21 May. \"Irwin\" figured in another mercy mission the night of 16 June 1945 when she assisted in the rescue of survivors from destroyer \"Twiggs\" (DD-591), sunk by combined air, torpedo, and suicide attacks.\n\n\"Irwin\" remained off Okinawa until hostilities ceased with Japan 15 August 1945. She entered Tokyo Bay 31 August and escorted occupation troops between Okinawa and Japan until 28 October when she stood out of Yokosuka for return to San Diego, arriving 15 November 1945. Following inactivation overhaul, she decommissioned there 31 May 1946 and joined the Pacific Reserve Fleet.\n\n\"Irwin\" recommissioned 26 February 1951 at Long Beach, California She sailed 12 May for overhaul in the Philadelphia Navy Yard, then shifted to base at Newport, R.I., 16 December 1952. She bolstered 6th Fleet strength and readiness in the Mediterranean, January to June 1952, trained along the eastern seaboard, then sailed from Fall River, Mass., 1 April 1953.\n\nSteaming through the Panama Canal, \"Irwin\" called at San Diego and Hawaii en route to join the 7th Fleet in waters off embattled Korea. She guarded the fast attack carriers as they blasted communist targets far inland, and herself joined in the destruction of enemy coastal supply routes and depots by making repeated coastal gunstrikes in support of United Nations troops ashore. Following the uneasy truce, she transited the Suez Canal and called at Mediterranean ports en route to Boston, arriving 2 October 1953.\n\n\"Irwin\" engaged in coastwise operations out of Newport until 5 January 1955 when she sailed for NATO maneuvers in the North Atlantic, thence into the Mediterranean. She returned to Newport 26 May 1955, engaging in Atlantic seaboard operations until departure 29 March 1956 to base at Long Beach, California\n\n\"Irwin\" arrived in Long Beach 15 April but soon deployed to spend the summer with the roving 7th Fleet in waters ranging from Japan to Okinawa, the Philippines and Taiwan. She returned to Long Beach 11 August for tactics ranging as far west as Hawaii, again sailing 12 March 1957 to join the 7th Fleet in the Far East. Following patrol of the Taiwan straits, combined fleet maneuvers with SEATO nations, and goodwill visits to ports of the Philippines and Japan, she returned to Long Beach 24 August 1957 for inactivation. She decommissioned 10 January 1958.\n\n\"Irwin\" received the Navy Unit Commendation and six battle stars for service in World War II and one battle star for Korean War service.\n\n\"Irwin\" was transferred to Brazil 10 May 1968, where she was renamed \"Santa Catarina\" (D32).\n\n\"Santa Catarina\" was stricken in 1988 and used thereafter as a practice target. In 1989 ex-D32 was used as target for the first launch of a live Sea Skua missile from a Brazilian Navy Westland Lynx helicopter. Ex-D32 was finally sunk in 1990.\n\n\n"}

A two-part episode of \"Star Trek: TNG\", the first episode was a cliffhanger season finale for the fifth season and the second episode was the premiere for the sixth season.\n\nSet in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D.\nIn this episode, an engineering team finds evidence that aliens visited Earth in 19th century San Francisco: Data's severed head, buried five hundred years ago. \n\nThe second part of the episode was nominated for three Creative Arts Emmy Awards, winning two: Outstanding Individual Achievement in Costume Design for a Series, and Outstanding Individual Achievement in Hairstyling for a Series.\n\nThe \"Enterprise\" is recalled to Earth on a priority mission pertaining to evidence of aliens on the planet 500 years before. They are shown a cavern near Starfleet Headquarters in San Francisco containing relics of the 19th century, and the severed head of Data. The \"Enterprise\" crew finds evidence pointing to a race of shapeshifters and cellular fossils native to the planet of Devidia II. Taking Data's second head, the \"Enterprise\" travels to the planet, and discovers a temporal disturbance on the planet. Though no life forms are visible, Deanna Troi senses the presence of suffering humans, and the crew work out that the aliens are slightly out of phase with time. Data notes that his android body has a phase discriminator that would allow him to see the aliens, and Captain Picard reluctantly allows him to do so. Once in phase with the aliens, Data describes them to the crew as absorbing strands of light from a device in the center of the cavern but otherwise appear benign. However, as he observes, two aliens enter a time portal that he is drawn into; Data finds himself on Earth in San Francisco in the late 19th century, August 11, 1893.\n\nData quickly surmises that he needs money to operate, and is able to win a sizable amount beating card sharks at their own game in poker. Taking residence in a local hotel, Data claims to be a French inventor, befriending the bellhop (future author Jack London) for help in acquiring parts to build a detector to find the aliens, using 19th century technology. Data finds Guinan, the bartender from the \"Enterprise\" in a newspaper photo, and goes to a reception she will be attending. As she is speaking with Samuel Clemens (Mark Twain), Data attempts to ask her questions about the future believing her to have followed him back in time, but discovers that she is native to 1893 and has yet to meet the \"Enterprise\" crew; Data's language intrigues Clemens and he begins to follow Data and Guinan around.\n\nMeanwhile, the \"Enterprise\" crew has determined how to build a similar phase discriminator to allow them to also see the aliens and go back in time to rescue Data. Guinan urges Picard to go along with the away team as, otherwise, they will have never met in the past and could change history. Picard and the rest of the away team activate the phase discriminator and see the same aliens as Data described, but discover that the strands of light they are consuming are human life forces, taken at the moment of death. The away team uses the time portal to travel back to the past to put a stop to the aliens.\n\nArriving in 1893, the away team quickly locates Data, who explains the current situation. Using Data's device, the team, followed by Guinan and Samuel Clemens are able to follow the alien shapeshifters to the same cavern near San Francisco, where they discover that the aliens have traveled to the 19th century to take advantage of a cholera outbreak, draining the life force from humans in infected areas to give the impression that their deaths were the result of an epidemic. In an ensuing struggle over a cane-like device used to open the portal, Data's head is detached from his body and left in 1893, and Guinan is injured. As Picard tends to Guinan, the rest of the away team, carrying Data's body which continues to grasp the cane device, follow one of the aliens to the future, with Clemens also following them. Picard learns from the other alien that should the \"Enterprise\" destroy their base in the 24th century, the strength of the time shift will be amplified, potentially devastating 19th-century Earth. Picard places a binary message using iron filings in Data's static memory to leave instructions for his crew in the future.\n\nIn the 24th century, Geordi La Forge reattaches Data's 500-year-old head onto his body, and Data discovers Picard's message. Data and LaForge devise a way of putting photon torpedoes in phase with the alien habitat, and therefore avoiding the amplification of the time shift effect, while Riker decides to attempt to rescue Picard. As studies of the cane device reveal that, due to instability of the portal, only one person would be able to return from the 19th century, Clemens offers to go back to save Picard. Clemens returns to the cavern in the 19th century, giving Picard the device to operate the time portal himself, and offering to tend to Guinan's wounds. Picard thanks Clemens, and explains that he wishes he could have gotten to know him better, but Clemens points out that his personality is written into his books. Picard returns to the future just as Riker orders Worf to fire the reconfigured torpedoes at the habitat, and is beamed out just in time.\n\nWriting for \"The Deseret News\", television editor Scott D. Pierce found the first part of the story \"fresh and intriguing\". \"Wired\" asked readers to select which episodes of the series were their favorites, and \"Time's Arrow\" was highlighted in their resultant article.\n\n\"Variety\" listed \"Time's Arrow\" (Parts I & II) as one of the top 15 episodes of \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\".\n\nIn 2016, the \"Time's Arrow\" two-part episode was ranked by SyFy Wire as the 9th best \"Star Trek\" franchise episode involving time travel. Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens) was ranked as one of the top seven time travelers of the franchise by \"Nerdist.com\" in 2019. They note that when he is taken to the future, he is glad there is no poverty, war, or prejudices.\n\nIn 2016, \"Empire\" ranked this the 32nd best out of the top 50 episodes of all the 700 plus \"Star Trek\" television episodes.\n\nIn 2018, CBR ranked this one of the top-twenty time travel themed episodes of all \"Star Trek\" series.\n\nIn 2020, \"SyFy Wire\" noted this episode the relationship between Picard and Data, in particular showing that Picard is reluctant to risk what they call his \"robot bestie\". They point out the episode begins with the shocking discovery of Data's head on Earth, which causes a certain concern among the crew that Data will die on ancient Earth somehow, leaving this head to be discovered in the 24 century.\n\nThe second part of the episode was nominated for three Creative Arts Emmy Awards, winning two:\n\nIn his book \"Time Travel\" (2012), author David Wittenberg wrote favorably of the depiction of the logic of time travel in the episode: \"\"Star Trek<nowiki>'s</nowiki>\" 'Time's Arrow' is both cognizant and respectful of … physical theory, offering a time travel loop in which causal order is not upset, or, in other words, in which no strictly logical paradoxes ensue.\"\n\n\n\n"}

It served as the nation's first international luxury hotel, one of the most visited by foreigners since its opening in 1969, built nearby the Bagh-e Bala Palace. The hotel has 200 rooms and is equipped with a swimming pool, a gym, and about four restaurants for dine in or room service.\n\nConstruction started on the hotel in April 1967 and was opened for business on 9 September 1969. While originally developed by the InterContinental Hotels Group and built by Taylor Woodrow construction from the United Kingdom, the Inter-Continental Hotel has had no association with InterContinental Hotels Group since 1980 following the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. Despite this it continues to use the name and logo without connection to the parent company.\n\nDuring the 1990s civil war it began receiving damage due to street warfare by militia men. In 1996, only 85 of the hotel's 200 rooms were habitable due to damage from rockets and shells. It was extensively used by western journalists during the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 as it was the only large-sized hotel still operating in the capital at the time.\n\nIn 2003 the hotel pool had no water and the gym was missing all of its furniture. The hotel had several power cuts per day. There were still bullet holes throughout the building, including the windows of the restaurant on the first floor. The furniture in the rooms was simple but clean. In February 2003, a British intelligence agent named Colin Berry, who had been involved in the recovery of surface-to-air missiles and other covert operations, was involved in a gun battle in the hotel. As a result, two Afghans were killed.\n\nThe hotel went through a $25 million renovation by a Dubai based company. It is the landmark used at the start of the Hash House Harriers weekly events.

When living in Europe he went by the pen names of Musagendo Sakurazawa, Nyoiti Sakurazawa, and Yukikazu Sakurazawa. He also used the French first name Georges while living in France, and his name is sometimes also given this spelling. He wrote about 300 books in Japanese and 20 in French. He defined health on the basis of seven criteria: lack of fatigue, good appetite, good sleep, good memory, good humour, precision of thought and action, and gratitude.\n\nOhsawa was born into a poor samurai family in Shingu City, Wakayama Prefecture. He had no money for higher education. Around 1913, he joined the Shokuiku movement, studying with Manabu Nishibata, a direct disciple of the late Sagen Ishizuka, in Tokyo. William Dufty describes the background (\"Nyoiti\" is a variant transcription of \"Nyoichi\"):\nThe gradual introduction of sugar into the Japanese diet brought in its wake the beginning of Western diseases. A Japanese midwife, trained in the techniques of Western medicine as a nurse, fell ill and was abandoned as incurable by the Western doctors she had espoused. Three of her children died the same way. The fourth, Nyoiti Sakurazawa, rebelled at the notion of dying of tuberculosis and ulcers in his teens. He took up the study of ancient Oriental medicine which had been officially outlawed in Japan. Sakurazawa was attracted to the unorthodox career of a famous Japanese practitioner, Dr. Sagen Ishizuka. Thousands of patients had been cured by Ishizuka (through traditional use of food) after they had been abandoned as incurable by the new medicine of the West.\n\nOhsawa writes in his books that he cured himself of tuberculosis at the age of 19 by applying the ancient Chinese concept of yin and yang as well as the teachings of Sagen Ishizuka.\n\nLater he traveled in Europe and began to spread his philosophy in Paris. It was in this period that he adopted his pen name \"Ohsawa\", supposedly from the French \"Oh, ça va\", which means \"All right\" or \"I'm doing fine\" as a reply to the question \"how are you doing?\"). After several years, he returned to Japan to start a foundation and gather recruits for his now formalized philosophy. In 1931, he published \"The Unique Principle\" explaining the yin and yang order of the universe.\n\nAfter drawing attention during World War II for his pacifist ideals, he wrote a book that predicted Japan's defeat and was incarcerated, narrowly escaping death. After being freed from prison by U.S. General McArthur, he moved his institution to a remote area in the mountains of Yamanashi Prefecture.\n\nIn 1961, he wrote \"Zen Macrobiotic\", referring to the macrobiotic diet that had been advocated by Christoph Hufeland in Germany since 1796. Subsequently, the philosophy of Ohsawa has been referred to as Macrobiotics.\n\nWhile he was in France, Ohsawa wrote a number of books in French, which were published by Vrin Publishers in Paris. Among them were \"L'Ere Atomique\" (The Atomic Age), written during the Cuban Missile Crisis. In this book, as in all the books Ohsawa wrote, he devoted considerable space to explaining how macrobiotics can shed light on many social problems as well as the causes of war, and help bring about a world in which war will be seen as an outcome of an error of judgment, and discarded as an effective solution to social conflict.\n\nOhsawa also created a stir by predicting the deaths of several notable people, including John F. Kennedy based on the condition known in Japan as \"sanpaku\" (literally \"three empty\"), a traditional Japanese physiognomic diagnosis in which a white area below as well as to each side of the iris appears when the eye is viewed straight on. This anomaly was considered a sign of extreme fatigue that made one accident-prone and slow to react. Samurai were trained to watch for this feature to assist in determining how formidable an enemy would be in hand-to-hand combat. Sakurazawa Nyoichi used this diagnosis in his teachings and Ohsawa adapted it as a more general diagnostic indication of one's general state of health. The assassination of President Kennedy led Tom Wolfe to write:\nAbdul Karim Kassem, Ngo Dinh Diem, and President Kennedy, all \"sanpaku\" and, now, shot to death, all destroyed by the fate of the sanpaku, which is more than coincidence and should be an alarm signal to men and nations, say the Macrobiotics, for thus it has been demonstrated by their leader, George Ohsawa, Japanese prophet of the Unique Principle.\n\nThis article caught the attention of William Dufty, who, finding relief in the brown rice diet recommended by Ohsawa, became an advocate of macrobiotics, and traveled to Paris to meet with Ohsawa and publisher Felix Morrow. Ohsawa handed Dufty a package, and said, \"Here is a lifetime of writing. Do your best with them. It's your turn.\" In 1965 Morrow's firm, University Books, published Ohsawa's writings under the provocative title \"You Are All Sanpaku\".\nOhsawa died of a heart attack at the age of 72.\n\nThe following bibliography of the writings of George Ohsawa is from page 218 of \"You Are All Sanpaku\":\n\nTranslations by Ohsawa\n\n\n\n"}

The multicultural country of Nicaragua experienced an excessive outpouring of citizens who fled the nation for their own security. Although many Nicaraguans live in Spain, Mexico, Panama and El Salvador, the majority of Nicaraguans living abroad are in Costa Rica and the United States. Nicaragua has the second largest number in Central America (after El Salvador) of people living abroad, almost 1,200,000. \n\nAccording to the Pew Hispanic Center, in 2007 there were 306,438 Nicaraguans in the United States. That represents the fourth greatest Central American community in the U.S. Nicaraguans are the largest Central American Community in Florida (esp. in Miami-Dade County) and the third largest in California (i.e. San Francisco and Los Angeles).\n\nAccording to the 2000 Census, there were 226,374 Nicaraguans in Costa Rica. However, this number is believed to be higher because there were thousands of undocumented immigrants at that time. Probably there are at least 500,000 Nicaraguans in Costa Rica, including illegals. In El Salvador almost 200,000 Nicaraguans live in the country to find available work, another 200,000 Nicaraguans live in Guatemala and 100,000 are believed to live in Honduras. \n\nAn effort is being made by the Academia de Genealogia de la Diaspora Nicaraguense by collecting and publishing all the family relations of Nicaraguans living abroad and their connections to their roots in the country.\n\nNicaraguans living abroad are also found in smaller numbers in Europe including the countries of France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Sweden and the UK; Australia and New Zealand; Canada, Brazil and Argentina; and Japan. Usually the Nicaraguans arrived in those countries fleeing from political oppression and economic conditions.\n\nIt's difficult to estimate the number of Nicaraguans living abroad because a substantial amount are living in host countries illegally.

{"id": "1803787", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1803787", "title": "Highway Star (song)", "text": "Highway Star (song)\n\n\"Highway Star\" is a song by the English rock band Deep Purple. It is the opening track on their 1972 album \"Machine Head\" and is the fastest song in tempo on the album. It is characterised by long, classically-inspired guitar and organ solos. \n\nThis song was born on a tour bus going to Portsmouth in 1971 when a reporter asked the band how they wrote songs. To demonstrate, guitarist Ritchie Blackmore grabbed an acoustic guitar and began playing a riff consisting of a single \"G\" repeated over and over, while vocalist Ian Gillan improvised lyrics over the top. The song was refined and was performed that same night. The song first appears on the 1972 LP \"Machine Head\". The track remains one of the band's staples in live concerts, and was the set opener even before it was released on any album.\n\nThe very first live version released, recorded live for German TV program \"Beat-Club\" in September 1971, is featured on the \"History, Hits & Highlights '68–'76\" DVD. It is the opening track on the live albums \"Nobody's Perfect\" (1988), \"Come Hell or High Water\" (1994), and \"From the Setting Sun… (In Wacken)\" (2015). The most famous live version is featured on the 1972 live album \"Made in Japan\". \"The Guardian\" said, \"Blackmore’s playing is like a force of nature on the \"Made in Japan\" version; those slashing chords in the intro, and that amazing solo featuring the distinctive neo-classical descending runs, combining the spirits of Bach and Jimi Hendrix.\"\n\nThe structure of the song consists of a 35-second bass/guitar introduction, before the band launches into the thumping opening riff, which soon leads into the first vocals section (0:55). The first two verses are sung, then Jon Lord begins his organ solo (2:14). This part consists mostly of fast, arpeggiated notes with a late Baroque/Early Classical influenced feel and makes use of the harmonic minor scale. The organ solo lasts for about a minute, then Ian Gillan sings the third verse of the song (3:24). At the conclusion of the third verse, the guitar solo starts (4:04), and lasts for just under a minute and twenty seconds. Blackmore wanted a very Bach like sound and worked out the solo note by note over the chord progression Dm, Gm, C, A which itself was borrowed from Bach. Then, the fourth and final verse, which in the original recording is simply a repetition of the first verse, is sung, finishing around 6:10.\nDepending on the version, there may be a 15-second-long exit section before the end of the song. When the song is played live, Gillan has been known to improvise its lyrics, as seen in the official video for the song.\n\nThe guitar solo would gain recognition when readers of \"Guitar World\" voted it No. 15 in their list of the \"100 Greatest Guitar Solos\".\n\nThe song was covered by the Gwar side project X-Cops in their 1995 album \"You Have the Right to Remain Silent...\", with the lyrics changed to reflect the band's police brutality theme.\n\nIn 2012, a tribute album featuring cover songs from Deep Purple's \"Machine Head\" was released, titled \"\". On this album, a live recording of \"Highway Star\" was featured by rock supergroup Chickenfoot, as well as a version recorded by Glenn Hughes, Steve Vai, and Chad Smith.\n\nOther bands to record the song include Angelus Apatrida, Point Blank, Stryper, Metal Church, Buckcherry, Type O Negative, Faith No More.\n\nThe cover of the song by Kaleb James was included in the track list for the Nintendo DS title \"Elite Beat Agents\".\n"}

The WCST was written by David A. Grant and Esta A. Berg. \"The Professional Manual for the WCST\" was written by Robert K. Heaton, Gordon J. Chelune, Jack L. Talley, Gary G. Kay, and Glenn Curtiss.\n\nA number of stimulus cards are presented to the participant. The participant is told to match the cards, but not how to match; however, they are told whether a particular match is right or wrong.\nThe original WCST used paper cards and was carried out with the experimenter on one side of the desk facing the participant on the other. The test takes approximately 12–20 minutes to carry out and generates a number of psychometric scores, including numbers, percentages, and percentiles of: categories achieved, trials, errors, and perseverative errors.\n\nSince 1948, the test has been used by neuropsychologists and clinical psychologists in patients with acquired brain injury, neurodegenerative disease, or mental illness such as schizophrenia. It is one of several psychological tests which can be administered to patients to measure frontal lobe dysfunction. When administered, the WCST allows the clinician speculate to the following \"frontal\" lobe functions: strategic planning, organized searching, utilizing environmental feedback to shift cognitive sets, directing behavior toward achieving a goal, and modulating impulsive responding. The test can be administered to those from 6.5 years to 89 years of age. The WCST, relies upon a number of cognitive functions including attention, working memory, and visual processing.\n\nThe WCST may be used to help measure an individual's competence in abstract reasoning, and the ability to change problem-solving strategies when needed. In this test, a number of cards are presented to the participants. The figures on the cards differ with respect to color, quantity, and shape. \n\nPsychological tests such as the WCST, administered alone, cannot be used to measure the effects of a frontal lobe injury, or the aspects of cognitive function it may affect, such as working memory; a variety of tests must be used. A subject may be good at one task but show dysfunction in executive function overall. Similarly, test results can be made misleading after testing the same individual over a long period of time. The subject may get better at a task, but not because of an improvement in executive cognitive function. They may have simply learned some strategies for doing this particular task that made it no longer a good measurement tool.\n\nThe trademark \"Wisconsin Card Sorting Test\" was registered in 2000 with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (Reg. #2320931, Ser # 75-588988) by Wells Print and Digital Services of Madison, Wisconsin.

It is found in a range of habitat types including rainforest, gallery forest, seasonally flooded forest, mangrove woodland, swamps, plantations and wooded savannah. It is a generally uncommon bird, and threatened by habitat loss, but it has a very wide range, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of least concern.\n\nThe chestnut woodpecker is about long and weighs about . The upper parts, wings and breast are a rich unbarred chestnut brown, while the rump, belly, flanks and crest are yellow or cinnamon, depending on race. The tail is blackish, the legs are grey and the bill yellow-white. The male has a red malar stripe, but otherwise the sexes are similar. \"C. e. leotaudi\" of Trinidad is smaller, paler, and much brighter than the mainland forms. Other subspecies have differing crest colours. \n\nThe habitat of this large woodpecker is forest and other closed woodland. The nest hole is in a dead tree, with the chamber floor up to 30 cm below the entrance. Three white eggs are laid. \nThe chestnut woodpecker mainly feeds in trees and bushes on insects, including ants and termites, and some fruit. It sometimes breaks into termite mounds and follows swarms of insects; it forages in the middle and lower stories of the forest, sometimes in the company of other smaller birds. It is a noisy species with a harsh parrot-like squawk \"whEEjer\". Both sexes drum.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1803798", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1803798", "title": "Fire Emblem Gaiden", "text": "Fire Emblem Gaiden\n\nFire Emblem Gaiden is a tactical role-playing game developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo for the Family Computer. Released in March 1992, it is the second installment in the \"Fire Emblem\" series, and the last to be developed for the Famicom. It builds upon the basic turn-based strategy gameplay of the previous title, while including new elements such as a navigable overworld. Set in the same world as its predecessor, \"\", \"Gaiden\" follows the battles of two opposing armies on the continent of Valentia, which is torn apart by political strife involving the princess Celica and her childhood friend Alm.\n\nThe development began after the commercial success of \"Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light\": original designer and writer Shouzou Kaga returned and assumed the role of director, while Yuka Tsujiyoko and Gunpei Yokoi returned respectively as composer and producer. Kaga's main concern was addressing pacing issues from the first game, and allowing for a greater connection between players and the characters. The game was a commercial success, selling over 324,000 units as of 2002. It received mixed critical reception and was later compared to \"\" in its short-lived innovations. Some elements would be used in later \"Fire Emblem\" titles. A full remake, titled \"\", was released worldwide on the Nintendo 3DS in May 2017.\n\n\"Fire Emblem Gaiden\" is a tactical role-playing game set on the continent of Valentia. Players assume control of two armies, led by Alm and Celica, who navigate an overworld and can visit towns, where they may recruit new allies or talk to traders to transfer items between the groups. The overworld is freely navigable, with additional areas opening up as the story progresses. The game features two difficulty levels: \"Normal\" and \"Easy\". On Easy mode, experience points earned through actions in combat are increased and items can be exchanged between units beyond vendor stalls.\n\nBattles use a turn-based battle system, with the player, enemies, and sometimes non-playable characters each taking turns and moving across a grid-based battlefield: battles are won by the player defeating all enemies in a map or killing a boss character. Enemies include human troops and monsters. The players are given a limited number of units, which are each assigned unique character classes that have various functions in battle, such as being mounted or having access to magic. A unit's class also affects their range of movement on the battlefield. In contrast to the previous game, character classes are not set but can switch once a character reaches a certain level. A special example of class promotion is the two main characters: Alm can promote from a Fighter to a Hero, while Celica promotes from a Priestess to a Princess. Each time a unit raises its experience level, its various stats increase based on a percent chance unique for each character. Spells for magical classes are learned through leveling up rather than being part of a separate system, and each spell consumes part of the caster's health when used.\n\nThe continent of Valentia was once divided between the Earth Mother Mila and the War Father Duma, sibling gods who split up and formed rival nations devoted to worshiping them: Mila's Kingdom of Zofia, and Duma's Empire of Rigel. The two deities, who each held extreme viewpoints on the world, ended up corrupting their subjects, and Zofia was eventually swallowed in a war triggered by its military leader, Chancellor Desaix, who attempted a coup d'état. Rigel's ruler Emperor Rudolf used this opportunity to lead Rigel's armies across Valentia in an attempt to conquer both countries. A village boy named Alm sets out on a quest to overthrow Desaix and drive Rudolf out of Zofia. Meanwhile, his childhood friend Celica, the exiled Princess Antheise of Zofia, embarks on a pilgrimage to discover Mila's whereabouts after she vanishes, causing a drought in Zofia. The two meet at Zofia Castle, but part ways when Alm is unwilling to attempt to find a peaceful resolution with Rudolf. Alm invades Rigel and defeats Rudolf, who reveals with his dying breath that Alm is actually his son Albein Alm Rudolf. It is then explained that Rudolf's invasion was intended to strengthen the continent's military forces and create a champion capable of defeating Duma and Mila, who have both fallen into insanity due to their extreme power. Alm infiltrates the Duma Temple and slays Duma with Celica's aid. With Duma's defeat, both deities disappear from the world. Alm and Celica marry and unite Valentia under their rule.\n\nThe development began following the commercial success of \"\" in 1990. The original game's designer and writer Shouzou Kaga returned to those roles and also became director. In addition to Kaga, Gunpei Yokoi returned from \"Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light\" as the game's producer, while the visuals were created by Naotaka Ohnishi, Satoshi Machida and Toshitaka Muramatsu. The music and sound design was handled by Yuka Tsujiyoko, who had worked on the first \"Fire Emblem\". The game's title, \"\"Gaiden\"\", is a Japanese term for a side story related to a larger work, denoting the game's status as a secondary adventure set in the same timeline as the first game.\n\nKaga designed \"Gaiden\" to address issues raised with the first game, such as tedious elements of map navigation. The system of \"Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light\" was used as base for various improvements to aspects such as enemy AI, although the gameplay adjustments ended up removing some of the strategic elements. These elements included a navigable overworld and more overt role-playing elements, along with the introduction of the class evolution system. Balancing these elements proved challenging for the team. The game made use of the new MMC4 memory chip, developed partially in response to the memory capacity problems faced during the development of the first game. For the story, Kaga wanted to deepen the relationship between the player and their units, represented through the growth of the characters through their battles. To create a stronger and broader central narrative, Kaga created the game's dual protagonists. An overt reference to \"Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light\" was made in the form of a trio of female Pegasus Knights, who were similar to another trio from the first game yet bore different names.\n\n\"Gaiden\" was released on the Famicom on March 14, 1992. It released on a 2Mbit cartridge. It was the second and last game in the series to be developed for the system, and has never received an official release outside Japan. It would later receive multiple releases on Nintendo's digital Virtual Console platform: the version for the Wii released on November 4, 2009, the version for the Nintendo 3DS on April 3, 2013, and the version for the Wii U on August 20, 2014.\n\nAs of 2002, \"Gaiden\" had sold 324,699 units. This made \"Gaiden\" the fourth best-selling title in the \"Fire Emblem\" series to that date. Video game magazine \"Famitsu\" gave \"Gaiden\" a score of 28 out of 40. In their review, critics noted that its gameplay changes meant that it could not be compared to its predecessor, with one critic enjoying its gameplay and calling it better than the first game. Another critic noted that it was fairly easy during the first half, then became rapidly more difficult during the later stages. Another reviewer noted that, while the number of maps had increased, the strategic elements had become noticeably weaker. Fan reception was positive: in a poll taken by \"Family Computer Magazine\", it received a score of 24.3 out of 30, indicating a large popular following. In a later retrospective article on the \"Fire Emblem\" series, Pocket Gamer's Mark Brown compared \"Gaiden\"s radical and short-lived shift in gameplay to that of \"\". Nadia Oxford of USGamer also compared \"Gaiden\" to \"Zelda II\" due to its short-lived gameplay changes, in addition to the similar case of \"\".\n\nWhile the majority of \"Gaiden\"s new gameplay elements would be discarded in later entries, the concept of class evolution was retained throughout following entries. The concept of a navigable overworld map and towns the player could visit was later explored in the Game Boy Advance entry \"\" in 2005. The story concept of the returning Pegasus Knights from \"Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light\" was also revisited in the Nintendo 3DS title \"Fire Emblem Fates\" in 2015, with the inclusion of characters from its 2012 predecessor \"Fire Emblem Awakening\". A full remake for the 3DS, titled \"\", was released worldwide in 2017; as \"Gaiden\" was released in Japan only, it marked the first time a form of the game was released elsewhere.\n\n"}
{"id": "1803801", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1803801", "title": "Seaton Tramway", "text": "Seaton Tramway\n\nSeaton Tramway is a narrow gauge electric tramway. The route runs through East Devon's Axe Valley, between the coastal resort of Seaton, the village of Colyford, and the ancient town of Colyton.\n\nIt operates over part of the former Seaton Branch Line, which closed in March 1966. The tramway was established in 1970 by Claude Lane, founder of Modern Electric Tramways Ltd, which had previously operated in Eastbourne between 1954 and 1969.\n\nFourteen tramcars are part of the visitor attraction, which sees about 80,000 visitors per year. All of the tramcars are based on classic British designs, and vary in size between half-scale (1:2) and two thirds-scale (2:3). Most were built from scratch by Claude Lane and/or his successor Allan Gardner, but three were rebuilt from full-size cars which originally ran in London, Bournemouth and Exeter.\n\nClaude Lane was the owner of the Lancaster Electrical Company of Barnet, a manufacturer of battery electric vehicles. His hobby was trams, and in 1949 he constructed a fully portable gauge tram system that he initially displayed at garden fetes, and then with semi-permanent sites at St Leonard's in 1951 and Rhyl from 1952 to 1957. In 1953 he agreed a lease at Eastbourne for a permanent gauge system, establishing Modern Electric Tramways Ltd as the parent company for the new venture.\n\nBy 1957 it was clear that the new line was a success, and the Rhyl operation was closed in order to concentrate all efforts on Eastbourne. Over the next nine years, cars 6, 7, 4, 2 & 12 were constructed. By the mid 1960s, it became apparent that the lease at Eastbourne would not be renewed, and so Lane sought a freehold site for a longer line, which would be laid to a wider 2 ft 9in gauge. This was as wide as the 2 ft cars could be regauged, while allowing for larger cars to be built in the future, the first of which was Car 8 in 1968.\n\nThe Beeching Axe was in full swing and the railway branch line to Seaton was closed in 1966. Negotiations to purchase the site from British Rail, and then to obtain the necessary Light Railway Order, took some time and was not granted until December 1969. Relocation from Eastbourne to Seaton took place over the winter of 1969/70.\n\nThe new line opened on 28 August 1970, just in time for the end of the holiday season. It was laid to the new 2 ft 9in gauge, with Car 8 operating the first departures. This initial opening was very limited: the line only went as far as the newly christened 'Bobsworth Bridge', named after the inaugural one shilling fare. The overhead electrical supply was yet to be installed, so as a temporary measure each tram was coupled to a battery trailer. Services closed again in September 1970, to allow further work to be completed including the extension to Colyford, erection of overhead traction poles and the gauge conversion of other rolling stock.\n\nClaude Lane suffered a heart attack and died on 2 April 1971, just before the Tramway was due to open for the new season. He died without a will in place, but his nephew Roger persuaded the rest of the Lane family to keep the family money invested, thus allowing the company to continue. Roger Lane joined the Board of Directors, and Claude's long-time assistant Allan Gardner was appointed Managing Director. In addition, a large number of volunteers offered their help to complete the tramway, and weekend working parties came to Seaton throughout the 1970s to assist with large-scale work on the track and overhead, and several volunteers gave their expertise to assist with specialist technical projects.\n\nThe years 1971 to 1980 were a time of swift expansion. The overhead electrical supply was completed in 1973, and in May 1975 an extension from Riverside Depot to Harbour Road was opened, which gave the Tramway a more visible presence in the centre of the town. Attention then turned towards the extension of the line from Colyford to Colyton. A marathon all-night working party in 1975 excavated the old branch line rail from the level crossing at Colyford, and by the following morning had replaced it with grooved tram rail. Over the next three years, most of the track and overhead wire was put in place, but in 1978 a flash flood just to the north of Colyford washed away a considerable amount of the newly laid ballast, and it was not until 1980 that the extension to Colyton was finally opened.\n\nIn 1984, ex-Metropolitan Tramways car 94 (Seaton car 14) was launched, the first addition to the fleet for 16 years, and the inaugural trip was driven by comedian and TV personality Larry Grayson. In 1988, the Allan Gardner-designed Car 17 was built, and in 1992 ex-Bournemouth car 106 (renumbered 16 for Seaton) came into service. 1998 saw the restoration and relaunch of former Exeter tram 19. With the exception of car 17, these trams are enclosed single deck saloons, aimed at providing comfort during bad weather and also to extend the season. Indeed, the success of out of season special events such as the Polar Express resulted in the conversion of car 17 to a fully enclosed saloon in 2016, and it was re-numbered 15.\n\nThe terminus at Seaton opened in 1975, and has since been entirely rebuilt twice. The initial layout included no shelter for passengers, with shop and ticket office facilities provided by tram shop car 01, which was towed down and back from the depot each day by the first and last service trams. In 1995, the first permanent building was constructed, which was an Edwardian-inspired steel-and-glass shelter with gazebo-style shop and ticket office, with a revised track layout laid at the same time.\n\nAfter the closure of the adjacent holiday camps in the early 2000s, that site and part of the Harbour Road Car Park were earmarked for extensive redevelopment. The former camp site became a large Tesco store and Premier Inn Hotel, with the remainder given over to a large private housing development. Meanwhile, part of the Harbour Road Car Park was allocated to the brand new Seaton Jurassic Centre. Both projects involved raising the level of the land by around two metres, which left the Tramway terminus looking out of place, so the Tramway decided to build a very different building in order to complement the rest of the regeneration area. This opened in June 2018, and is a modern, fully enclosed building, featuring a four track layout, as well as a small cafe and shop, toilets, and staff facilities. The new building is much more suitable for operation during inclement weather and for early/late season operation, and acts as a base for a range of tramway events.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1975 the main terminus was located at Riverside, beside the tram depot. In May 1975 an extension was opened, taking the tram line into the centre of the town, and the new Seaton station. Riverside station became the main Seaton tram stop again in 2017 and 2018 whilst the new Seaton station was under construction. Riverside station has fully surfaced platforms, and a passing loop. Booking office facilities (together with souvenir sales) were provided through the location of tram 01 at the station. Riverside station is sometimes used out of season in connection with special events.\n\nThe main intermediate station is located in Colyford village, adjacent to the White Hart Inn. There are surfaced platforms, and a passenger waiting shelter. The station includes the Colyford passing loop, and there is also a single siding. A Victorian railway lavatory is also located on the station, but is not in use.\n\nColton station features a long passing loop, an arrivals headshunt, and a single siding. The station buildings include passenger waiting rooms, toilets, cafeteria, and exhibition. There is outside seating on the platform and in a picnic area, and there is a car park. There is a play area for children. The station is situated about three quarters of a mile from Colyton village.\n\nSeaton Tramway is a single line system, with passing loops roughly every half mile. The trams run to a timetable which includes scheduled passes at designated passing loops. A single line token system operates between Seaton and Riverside, because this section contains four sharp curves which restrict the driver's line of sight. A two-way radio system is also used to keep drivers in touch with the duty inspector. The scheduled journey time from Seaton to Colyford is 13 minutes, and Colyford to Colyton is a further 10 minutes, making a total journey time of 23 minutes.\n\nSeaton Tramway operates a daily service between Easter and the end of October, with a weekend-only service operating from mid-February until Easter. In addition, there are several out of season events, principally bird watching specials and Polar Express trips during December.\n\nBetween April and September, trams depart every 20 minutes, and the service is operated by a minimum of four trams, including a \"shunt\" car at Seaton. Additional departures are scheduled at peak times according to demand, which can raise the number of cars in service to seven or eight. Outside of this period, trams depart every 30 minutes, a service operated by two or three cars.\n\nIt is possible for groups of 20 people or more to book a designated tram, which runs either in tandem with one of the service cars, or six minutes behind the service car in its own timetable slot. Individuals can also book a tram for a range of tram driving lessons and experiences.\n\nA combination of paid and volunteer staff operate the Tramway. A small permanent staff is complemented by a large number of seasonal drivers, shop and cafe staff.\n\n"}

{"id": "1803813", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1803813", "title": "Giant's Causeway Tramway", "text": "Giant's Causeway Tramway\n\nThe Giant's Causeway Tramway came about through the enthusiasm of William Atcheson Traill, M.A.Ing., of Ballylough (1844–1934), together with his brother Dr Anthony Traill, who between them undertook most of the promotion and fundraising for the line. W.A. Traill was a man with not only an interest in railways but also a keen interest in technological developments in engineering. The Act of Parliament incorporating 'The Giant's Causeway, Portrush, and Bush Valley Railway and Tramway Company' was passed on 26 August 1880. It authorised a tramway from Portrush to Bushmills and a railway from there to join the Ballycastle Railway (also 3 ft. gauge) at Dervock. The only section of the railway ever built was a short spur at Dervock. The Dervock section was abandoned by an 1885 Act, which authorised extension from Bushmills to the Causeway.\n\nAt the Berlin Trade Fair of 1879 Siemens was demonstrating the first railway electrification system and it was that which led the British branch of the firm to be commissioned to incorporate this new technology into the Giant’s Causeway Tramway venture. Sir William Siemens (1823–83) was briefly a Director and Siemens Brothers of London were appointed electrical engineers to the company, their representative being Dr Edward Hopkinson, who later went on to work on the Bessbrook and Newry Tramway and the City & South London Railway. Surveying and civil engineering work was carried out by Edward Price, son of the eminent Irish civil engineer James Price.\n\nThe line was the world’s first to be powered by hydroelectricity, something that was later developed at Bessbrook and in Switzerland. Traill built a generating station at Walkmill Falls () head), near Bushmills, installing Alcott water turbines to produce up to 250 volts at 100 amps of electrical power for his line. Later turbines were installed. This building, although without its equipment, is still in existence. Because of legal problems over water rights, erection of the Walkmills turbines was delayed and when the first section of the tramway, from Portrush to Bushmills, was opened on 29 January 1883 some of the timetabled passenger traffic was handled by steam tram engines which were in any case necessary on the town section in Portrush where it was impossible to provide electric power since this was originally fed to the trains via an elevated third rail which ran alongside the line. Therefore, a steam generator was installed at the Portrush depot (by 1936 replaced by a 550 volt diesel generator for the Portrush-Dunluce section). The ceremonial opening, using electric traction, took place on 28 September 1883 although a full scheduled electric service did not begin until 5 November and steam locomotives remained available for use until at least 1926. In 1897 were steam operated and electric. In 1901 the figures were and respectively. Very little use of steam was made after 1916.\nThe section from Bushmills to the Giant's Causeway opened on 1 July 1887. In 1895 a cyclist died of electric shock after coming into contact with the conductor rail. At the subsequent inquiry it was revealed that the line voltage varied from an average of 290 V up to 360 V, and the company agreed to a temporary reduction in the voltage, which limited the number of services that could be electrically worked. The third rail was replaced by overhead electric wire using side poles from 26 July 1899, apparently initially at 250 V. Voltage drop remained a problem and the tram was the subject of a song by the Irish Rovers which comments on its slow speed. The song was written by Hugh Speers of Bushmills. After upgrading of the Bushmills generating station in 1907 it was possible to produce a 550 V output.\n\nTraill, a former geological surveyor, expected a considerable mineral traffic between quarries along the line and Portrush harbour, and there was originally a goods branch into the main square of Bushmills. However, this traffic fell away, the narrow gauge harbour branch being taken up when the Northern Counties station was opened in 1893, and for most of its life the line primarily served tourists visiting the Causeway. From 1925/26 the line was closed down during each winter.\n\nIncreased patronage, partly from military traffic, during World War II meant a brief revival of winter services, but receipts were becoming inadequate to support maintenance of the company’s ageing assets, and the line did not reopen after the end of the 1949 season on 20 September, and was subsequently dismantled.\n\nThe Giant's Causeway and Bushmills Railway was later constructed over the final two miles (3.2 km) of the Tramway and carried its first passengers at Easter 2002.\n\nThe line was single track with passing loops at about intervals and was laid on sleepers apart from the first of street running through Portrush. The route began in Eglinton Street alongside Portrush railway station. After passing the main depot on the edge of the town, it took up a position on the seaward side of the coast road, passing the White Rocks, a summit at Clooney Hill and Dunluce Castle before reaching Bushmills station (the main building of which still stands). There was a subsidiary depot here. Beyond the crossing of the road to Portballintrae the line left the roadside; this is the section occupied by the present-day railway. The route crossed Bushfoot Golf Course and crossed the River Bush by the Victoria Jubilee Bridge, which had a lattice girder superstructure. This has been replaced, but some of the ornamental ironwork is preserved at the present Giant’s Causeway station. From here the line passed by the dunes alongside Bushfoot Strand and climbed to the terminus just below the Causeway Hotel. The station facilities consisted of little more than a corrugated-iron shelter.\n\nThe original cars were built by the Midland Railway Carriage and Wagon Company and were later followed by 5 examples from GEC, each with 2 x British Thomson-Houston motors, and also a Peckham car. There were a maximum of six electric power cars owned at any one time, all being single-truck, single-deck vehicles with both enclosed and “toast rack” examples; typically these would haul several 4-wheel “toast rack” trailers, of which there were 15. There were four steam tram engines, ordered from Wilkinson of Wigan. They had vertical boilers, weighed 7 tons and burnt coke. No.2 was scrapped in 1899, No.1 converted to a ballast wagon in 1910 and Nos. 3 (Dunluce Castle) and 4 (Brian Boroihme) were sold in 1930 for the River Bann Navigation works near Portstewart.\n\nA power car and trailer are restored at the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum, Cultra and another power car is in the care of the National Transport Museum of Ireland at Howth.\n\n\n\n"}

It is also located in the Roman Catholic diocese of Regensburg. Stamsried has a population of 2,319 as of June 2004 and an area of 4343 hectares (43.43 square kilometers, 16.8 square miles) which includes surrounding countryside outside the built up area of the village itself, the population density is 53.4 persons per square kilometer (138.3 per square mile). Stamsried is located 456 meters (1,496 feet) above sea level and contains rolling hills as high as 600 meters (1,968 feet).\n\nStamsried is located near the \"Upper Bavarian Forest Nature Park\" and therefore tourism makes up a portion of its economy as shown by the number of small hotels and \"pensions\" or bed and breakfasts. Sites of interest within Stamsried itself include the Catholic parish church of St. John the Baptist built in 1719. Near the church there is a square with the \"Mariensäule\" or Marian column erected in 1729 and four other statues of saints erected in 1735 (St. Florian, St. Sebastian, John the Baptist and John of Nepomuk).\n\nIn the 9th century the Marcomanni were the first settlers in the region.\nThe earliest historical mention of Stamsried dates back to the year 1140, due to a tournament of 63 knights. 1346 Dietrich II of Kürn is mentioned as owner of Stamsried. He built the Kürnburg castle in 1354 and for most of its history it has maintained a low-key rural Bavarian culture relatively isolated from political situations in the larger world. The Bavarian statesman Karl von Abel retired and lived until his death in 1859 on his tenure manor in Stamsried. After the death of Ludwig von Abel the village became property of the kingdom of Bavaria. In the two world wars Stamsried was taken over by allied powers without a single shot being fired or any major resistance, in particular at the end of World War II American tanks entered the village square and were welcomed peaceably with a white flag. In recent times Stamsried and the entire surrounding areas has been a stronghold of the conservative Bavarian political party, the Christian Social Union, of which the current mayor Alfred Long is a member.\n\nThe ruin is located on a hill above sea level near Stamsried.\nWith the allowance of count palatine Ruprecht II, Dietrich II of Kürn built a castle on the top of the Heitberg in 1354. Due to heritage the castle changed ownership in 1406 to Hermann the Hertenberger; in 1425 to Gabein the Freudenberger; then the Wartenberger family in 1429; and finally to the Füchse of Winklarn in 1590. In 1561 the castle and the village became separated properties. During the Thirty Years' War, on 11 January 1634, Swedish troops under duke Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar destroyed the castle. In the 1970s the ruin was restored.\n\n"}

The overall structure and key elements were designed by Charles Moore and Joseph Maiden, and various other elements designed and built under the supervision of Allan Cunningham, Richard Cunningham, and Carrick Chambers. The garden is owned by the Government of New South Wales and administered by the Royal Botanic Gardens and Domain Trust. The Botanic Garden, together with the adjacent Domain were added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.\n\nThe Garden and The Domain are open every day of the year and access is free. Its stunning position on Sydney Harbour, the Sydney Opera House and the large public parklands of The Domain ensure it is one of the most visited attractions in Sydney. The garden is bordered by the Cahill Expressway to the south and west, Macquarie Street to the northwest, Art Gallery Road to the east, and Sydney Harbour to the north.\n\nThe first farm by European settlers on the Australian continent, at Farm Cove, was established in 1788 by Governor Phillip. Although that farm failed, the land has been in constant cultivation since that time, as ways were found to make the relatively infertile soils more productive. The Botanic Garden was founded on this site by Governor Macquarie in 1816 as part of the Governor's Domain. Australia's long history of collection and study of plants began with the appointment of the first Colonial Botanist, Charles Fraser, in 1817. The Botanic Gardens is the oldest scientific institution in Australia and, from the earliest days, has played a major role in the acclimatisation of plants from other regions. After a succession of colonial botanists and superintendents, including the brothers Richard and Allan Cunningham, both also early explorers, John Carne Bidwill was appointed as the first Director in 1847. Charles Moore was possibly the most influential Director, with his responsibility spanning 48 years, from 1848 to 1896. Moore was succeeded by Joseph Maiden who added much to Moore's maturing landscape, and served for a period of 28 years.\n\nCharles Fraser, Superintendent 1821–31, was the first botanist appointed to develop the gardens along scientific lines. Fraser made many inland excursions particularly with John Oxley and brought back plants and specimens. Fraser's plantings between 1827–8 from his Brisbane district and northern NSW travels survive, and include hoop pines (\"Araucaria cunninghamii\"), weeping lilly pillies (\"Waterhousia floribunda\"), a hoop (or Moreton Bay) pine (\"Araucaria cunninghamii\"), 2 swamp oaks (\"Casuarina cunninghamiana\") on the eastern side of the palm grove. On his death in 1831 he was succeeded by Richard Cunningham. His brother, the explorer Allan Cunningham was also a director. A native red cedar Fraser collected in 1822 formerly thought to have been from the Parramatta region has been genetically tested and found to have been collected in the Dorrigo region. This tree grows still near the Palm House (beside Farm Cove Creek in Bed 9).\n\nIn 1825 Governor Brisbane directed that the Garden extend west of Farm Cove Creek, for an experimental garden, to acclimatise Australian plants for export and imported plants. Between 1829 and 1838 the wine growing industry of New South Wales began in the Garden with some vines being brought out with the First Fleet (1788), and a large supplementary collection of around 365 vine cultivars donated by James Busby in 1832 (planted early 1833). Busby in fact imported cuttings of over 540 vines, but all those of at least 170 of the accessions were either dead on arrival at Sydney or did not survive through to mid-1834. For three or four years, vines propagated from these plants were distributed throughout the colony, but the collection increasingly fell into neglect and was in a parlous state well before 1840, with very many vines dead and many of the remainder unidentifiable due to the loss of their labels and inadequate record keeping. In the 1830s the Lower Garden area at the head of Farm Cove was developed and the shoreline laid out in an ornamental fashion with serpentine paths.< In 1833 four gardens were recognised: the botanic garden (the lower garden at the head of the cove); the fruit garden; the experimental garden and the kitchen garden, still producing food for the Governor's table. Between 1837 and 1845 the (New) Government House was built in The Domain's north (north of the current extent of the Botanic Garden). In 1847 the fig tree avenue of Moreton Bay figs (\"Ficus macrophylla\") was planted, lining main public entry to gardens from Macquarie Street eastward (now the line of the Cahill Expressway).\nThe East India Company windmill stood in The Domain near Government House stables. It was located close to the statue of a huntsman with dogs by Henri Henri Alfred Jacquemart, which is still in the grounds of the Royal Botanical Garden. Built of stone, it was owned by the Government and was used for grinding the grain of the settlers. According to \"Freeman’s Journal\", the windmill was built by the East India Company who were granted land around Farm Cove. The Governor of New South Wales later took forcible possession of the mill which resulted in a drawn-out lawsuit between the company and the government. During the dispute the Collector of Internal Revenue, Mr Wm. McPherson hired a manager to live in the cottages next to the mill. At this time, where the Bent-street entrance is was occupied as a large dairy, kept by Mr W. Stone. There was a large gate near the dairy; it stood a bit in from Bent-street, and faced Macquarie-street, with two large Norfolk Island pines on either side. This was the entrance to the company’s mill, but it could not be called a public entrance in the accepted meaning, it being on private property. Finally, in 1835 Sir Richard Bourke had the mill taken down and removed.\nIn 1848 John Carne Bidwill was appointed (the first such title) Director, by Governor Fitzroy. Meantime in England horticulturist Charles Moore (1820–1905) was appointed Director by the English Government. Bidwell was succeeded the following year by Moore. Bidwill was offered the post of Commissioner of Lands, Wide Bay. Moore was a Scotsman who had trained in the Botanic Gardens of Trinity College, Dublin. Moore remained Director for 48 years (1848–96) and did much to develop the Botanic Gardens in their modern form. He boldly tackled the problems of poor soil, inadequate water and shortage of funds to develop much of the Gardens as we see them today. The Palm Grove at the heart of the Garden is a reminder of his skill and foresight, as is the reclaimed land behind the Farm Cove seawall which significantly expanded the area of the Garden. Moore renovated paths throughout the upper gardens, built new paths in lower garden and added were added to the lower gardens between 1848 and 1858. Between 1848 and 1879 Moore organised construction of the sea wall and reclamation of Farm Cove's tidal flats (work proceeded in two stages) to expand the Lower Garden, the wall being built of stone recycled from demolished Old Government House in Bridge Street, and a long walk was established along Farm Cove. Ornamental ponds in the lower garden were laid out using Farm Cove creek, water supply for upper gardens was aided by water pipe installed from Macquarie Street.\n\nOther work completed under Moore's extensive tenure included:\n\nThe Garden Exhibition Palace was built on land between the Government House stables (now the Conservatorium of Music) and Governor Bourke's statue, an area until then used for grazing. The Palace was built to a design by Government Architect James Barnet for the first Australian International Exhibition. It was the epitome of the High Victorian style, complemented by the surroundings new gardens. Its giant dome was in diameter surmounted by a lantern above the ground'. Under the dome was a statue of Queen Victoria; there were four corner towers, and a floor area of over , making it a major landmark in the city landscape. he International Exhibition held in the Palace attracted over one million visitors, displaying products of the arts and industry, museum collections from the library of the Linnean Society (botany and natural sciences), and exhibition of specimen displays from the Museums Collection of the Technological, Industrial and Sanitary Museum of NSW, (organised by its then Curator, Joseph Maiden)(the museum eventually became the Museum of Applied Sciences later the Powerhouse Museum), and its surrounding \"instant\" gardens of lawns, bedding and shrubberies around it, near Macquarie Street/Bent Street. However, the building was destroyed by fire in 1882. After the clean up of new gardens were added to the RBG \"Palace Garden\"). Joseph Maiden moved and displayed the remnants of the exhibition fire to a pavilion in The Domain which became the official museum, incorporating a herbarium.\n\nIn 1880 a monkey house was built as part of the zoo. The same year, Tarpeian Way, including a stone stairway of 53 steps, was cut out of the rocky escarpment north of Bennelong Point, forming a south east boundary to the gardens. From \"The Sydney Morning Herald\", 4 October 1880:\nScottish gardener Alexander Grant was born in 1845 at Cullen, Scotland and served an apprenticeship in the gardens of Cullen House in Banffshire. Before migrating to Australia in 1878 he followed his profession in several Scottish gardens, including the Botanic Gardens in Edinburgh. Grant arrived in the colony in 1878 and worked first at \"Yaralla\", Concord for the Walkers for some considerable time, then at \"Rosemont\", Woollahra for Alexander Campbell MLC, then for Mr Tooth at the \"Swifts\", , which he planned and laid out. There is no record of where Grant was living while working at \"Yaralla\" and \"Rosemont\", though from 1881 he lived at \"Willow Cottage\" in Point Piper Road – west side (later Ocean Street), Paddington until he moved to quarters in the Botanic Garden, Sydney in 1882 for work there. It is likely that the positions at \"Yaralla\" and \"Rosemont\" both included quarters for a single man and that only after he married Margaret Stevenson in January 1880 was he obliged to find alternative accommodation (\"Willow Cottage\").\n\nTowards the end of his time as Director, Moore, together with Ernst Betche, published the \"Handbook of the Flora of New South Wales\", further establishing the Botanic Garden as a centre for the science of botany.\n\nFrom 1882 on Director Joseph Maiden added lighting (e.g.: on the sea walk on Farm Cove), seating, lavatories, drinking fountains and pathways. In 1883 the zoo was relocated to Moore Park; and of Outer Domain were incorporated into the Lower Garden, completing the ring of waterfront along Farm Cove. During the 1880s the Tarpeian Rock was a prominent, dramatic and significant sandstone cliff landscape feature on the north west boundary of the Domain facing Bennelong Point and the Sydney Opera House, cut for the extension of Macquarie Street. The Rock derives its name from the famous Tarpeian Rock on the Capitoline Hill in Rome from where prisoners were hurled to their deaths in ancient times. A stairway gives access from close to the Sydney Opera House to the top of the rock and The Domain. An early carving in the sandstone cliff is located about above the fifth step from the base of the cliff. The carving reads \"The Tarpeian Way.\" It possibly dates from the time of construction in the 1880s.\n\nBetween 1896 and 1901 Director Maiden installed new lighting, seating, lavatories, fountains and pathways. Lighting along the sea walk and the lower garden installed, making the ring of water front of the lower gardens complete. In 1897 the Governor Phillip fountain was built near Macquarie Street/Garden palace gates. In 1899 a new herbarium building (second storey added by Govt. Architect Vernon to existing building, ground floor adapted as lecture hall and library, museum and admin centre) was built; now the Anderson Building.\n\nMoore was succeeded by Joseph Henry Maiden who, during his 28-year term, added much to Moore's maturing landscape. He organised the construction of a new herbarium building, opened in 1901 (today part of the Anderson Building), and made major improvements to The Domain. However, the Botanic Garden suffered from loss of staff positions during the World War I, and in the Great Depression of the 1930s, the position of Director was lost. Both the Herbarium and the living collections languished.\n\nIn 1901 Maiden had an obelisk erected in a central pond, housing the relocated remains of Allan Cunningham from the Devonshire Street Cemetery. Maiden also drained and sewered the gardens. Between 1908 and 1916 the Sydney Conservatorium of Music was created by adapting the former Governor's Stables in the Western Domain. In 1912 the Palm House new superstructure was completed, designed by Government Architect George McRae. By 1916 there were of space with the Botanic Garden and The Domain. In 1926 the Spring walk was replanted.\n\nIn 1936, on the site of the former aviaries/zoo, in the eastern section of the Garden, a succulent garden was created, near the Herbarium. In 1938 the Pioneer Memorial Women's' Garden opened, laid out in sunken circular area under the centre of the former (1879–82) Garden Palace dome. Laid out by Andersons & Co. of Sydney. In 1940 the aviary was removed.\n\nFrom 1958 until the 1960s the Cahill Expressway resumption and construction work began, bisecting The Domain and the Botanic Garden, partly destroying Fig Tree Avenue (first entrance, planted 1847) and loss of 24 palm trees and 12 other trees lost. A new Garden entrance was made on Macquarie Street with pools and prostrate plants, and recycled sandstone and iron gates from the post-Garden Palace fire. This entrance leads to the Palace Gardens. The Botanic Garden and The Domain were sewered for the first time since 1792. From 1945 Robert Anderson worked to reunify the Herbarium and Botanic Garden. In 1959 the title 'Royal' was granted, following the landing of Queen Elizabeth II in Farm Cove, this being the first site in Australia on which a reigning monarch had stood.\n\nAs Director, Knowles Mair (1965–70) achieved reunification and the Royal Botanic Garden began its return to eminence. In 1968 the Herbarium was combined with the Royal Botanic Garden. From 1969 further reconstruction and planting after completion of Cahill Expressway and The Domain Parking station. Australian and New Zealand native plants were extensively used, in the plantings near the Bent Street/Macquarie Street entrance (opposite the State Library) and Woolloomooloo gates near Mrs Macquarie's Road. Many glasshouses were removed in the 1970s under Director Mair, and the new Pyramid Glasshouse, built in 1970–71, designed by Anchor, Mortlock & Murray. The first of its kind in the world, it contained a spiral staircase to allow visitors to observe all levels of tropical plant growth within.\n\nIn 1972–85 Dr Lawrence Johnson, Director, proposed the \"thematic\" planting scheme in evidence today. NSW and Queensland rainforest trees collected by Fraser, the Allan and Richard Cunningham, and Charles Moore scattered throughout the Garden were supplemented by a new section of tropical and subtropical rainforest flora near the Pyramid glasshouse. The palm collection, which is planted in three separate groves in the Garden, was thinned of duplicate species, particularly in Moore's original palm grove, and new species were added. The fig (\"Ficus\") collection, mainly in the lower garden, was rationalised and centred on the slope below Government House, with many additional species added. A garden bed of local native species was added near the Cunningham building in the Upper garden, and the long bed of native small trees and shrubs along the boundary of the gardens on Macquarie Street was thickened with new plantings. A collection of eucalypts on the lawns of the Lower Garden north of the Macquarie Wall was under planted with a new collection of cycads, many relocated from the original Moore Palm Grove. A Myrtales bed near the Twin ponds in the Lower Garden was added.\n\nDirectors, Dr John Beard (1970–72) and Dr Lawrence Johnson (1972–85) further developed the organisation. The breadth of activities increased over these decades with the formation of the Friends of the Royal Botanic Garden; educational and ecological programs; the Flora of New South Wales; the scientific journals \"Telopea\" and \"Cunninghamia\" and programs of computerised documentation of both the living and herbarium collections.\n\nBetween 1970 and 1980 the new succulent and cacti garden was built on the site of the former aviary/zoo near Mrs Macquarie's Road in the east. In 1978 the administration of the Botanic Garden and National Herbarium of NSW were transferred from the Department of Agriculture (where they had been administered since 1908) to the Premier's Department. In 1972, a carpark for the Sydney Opera House was not built after the Builders Labourers Federation placed a green ban on the site.\n\nIn 1980 the Royal Botanic Gardens Trust Act was passed by Parliament, seeking to prevent further erosion of the grounds and excisions of land (the in 1916 had diminished to in 1980). Also in 1980 Centennial Park, which until then had been administered by staff of the Botanic Gardens since Moore's directorship, became autonomous under its own Trust.\n\nIn 1982 the new Herbarium building was built under Director Johnson opened (named the Brown building in honour of colonial botanist Robert Brown), linking the former Herbarium (now called the Maiden Theatre and Moore Room) building and the 1870s former Superintendent/Director's residence. The former Herbarium was adapted to a visitors' centre, shop and exhibitions space (now the Moore Room, within the then renamed R. H. Anderson Building), and the former Director's residence, named now the Cunningham building, was adapted for office use by staff. The complex was opened on 6 November 1982 by then Premier Neville Wran, QC MP. The Brown building had three levels housing the herbarium collection in 55,000 specially-designed red plastic boxes, plus scientific staff offices, a laboratory, scanning electron microscope and full drying room and library. In July 1982 a general meeting established the Friends of the Botanic Gardens and members' events (to raise funds for the Botanic Garden) commenced in December 1982.\n\nIn 1987 and 1988 under Director Carrick Chambers, two satellite botanic gardens areas were opened, Mt. Annan (subsequently renamed the Australian Botanic Garden Mount Annan on Narellan Road near Campbelltown featuring native plants, and Mount Tomah (subsequently renamed the Blue Mountains Botanic Garden on the Bells Line of Road in the northern Blue Mountains, featuring cool-climate plants. Both were formally opened in 1988 as part of Australia's Bicentennial celebrations. During 1988 and 1989 a new rose garden was built near the Bridge Street gates (since removed). A new curved \"Arc\" glasshouse was built adjoining (east of) the Pyramid glasshouse, which was intended for ferns. It has since been adapted for tropical plants. In 2015 the Pyramid was demolished to make way for \"Calyx\" the new display and tropical plant centre. The curved \"Arc\" glasshouse is being adapted as part of the same works. The Royal Botanic Gardens celebrated its 175th anniversary in 1991. During Professor Chambers' ten years as Director, the Rose Garden (1988), the Fernery (1993), the Herb Garden (1994), and the Oriental Garden (1997) were opened and the Rare and Threatened Species Garden (1998) was commenced to further enrich the experience of visitors. The Royal Botanic Garden Foundation was established to seek a wider range of support for future needs.\n\nDuring the 1990s Asian themed plants garden added in Lower Garden below kiosk and east of Twin ponds. A new fernery designed by John Barbeceto was built in the Middle Gardens (on the site of two former shade houses) adjoining the gardens nursery area and palm grove. A new herb garden was built in the western side of the Lower gardens below the Conservatorium. Considerable upgrade works were undertaken in the run up to the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, including adaptation of existing buildings for new central shop and toilets. The Cadi Jam Ora – First Fleet Encounters garden was created north of the Palm House in the Middle Garden area. John Lennis (1952–2015) as Aboriginal Education Officer was responsible for the content, \"flavour\" and involvement of Aboriginal people in this garden. During 1992 and 19933 the Palm House glasshouse was reconstructed to its 1912 form and adapted to become an exhibition space. About 50% of its original glazing was recycled on the south side, also s patterned glass was reused. In the mid-1990s a fourth level was added to the Robert Brown building (National Herbarium), providing more work spaces and shelving for 20,000 more red herbarium boxes and a sloping roof to stop leaks.\n\nFrom 1996–8 the Rare & Endangered Garden, was laid out north of the Herbarium, growing and displaying plants under threat in the wild or out-of-fashion in cultivation. Jeremy Coleby-Williams was instrumental in establishing this. Also in 1997–8 the HSBS Oriental Garden was established west of the lotus pond in the middle garden. Its site has Asian associations dating from 1917. In 1998 the Wollemi pine (\"Wollemia nobilis\") was discovered in a remote gorge in Wollemi National Park by Phillip Noble, triggering an innovative propagation campaign to secure this species in ex-situ cultivation. An early specimen was planted on the site of the main intersection of paths between the middle garden, Cadi Jam Ora – First Encounters and the Rare and Endangered Gardens.\n\nIn 2000 the toilet block in the Palm Grove was adapted and extended to become the Garden Shop, renamed the Palm Grove Centre. During 2000 to 2001 the Conservatorium of Music was redeveloped with new underground extensions, demolition of trial grass beds and incorporation of new roof garden areas to gardens over the new Conservatorium. A new land bridge was built (completed in 2005) over the Cahill Expressway/Eastern Distributor redevelopment, linking the Art Gallery of NSW, Mrs Macquarie's Road, The Domain and Botanic Garden, with small additional land area and new native plantings to The Domain. In 2003 a Fig tree avenue (Cahill Expressway median) was removed. Originally it was planted in 1847 in the brief directorship of John Carne Bidwill). The rose garden was also removed for redevelopment, the Spring Walk plantings (azaleas, etc.) were removed for fumigation/fallowing of soil.\n\nIn 2005 the fourth on-site Rose Garden near the Conservatorium and its adjoining pergolas were altered with additions made to both to allow functions, set up and preparation facilities, and a new amenities block. From 2006 the Cacti and Succulent Garden was partially revamped by Jamie Durie, celebrity horticulturist. The Central Gardens Depot was also redeveloped, with repair of significant heritage glasshouses, new glasshouses, store and staff areas.\n\nFrom 2011 onwards the relocation of a growing colony of roosting grey-headed flying foxes (bats) in the Palm Grove has resulted in slow renewal of that area. The roosting activities of the bats had caused the death of a number of highly significant trees and previous attempts using noise, sprinklers and lights had proved ineffective in encouraging the animals to move. In Autumn 2014 Palm Grove was restored, with over 1300 palm species being donated by Illawarra businessman and conservationist Colin Wilson, after he saw the damage flying foxes (bats) had caused. Efforts to grow this collection will help secure the survival of many very rare species. The Palm Grove was once internationally recognised as one of the best in the world. The goal was to restore it to equal or surpass its past glory and give an opportunity to see a wide range of palms. At their peak some 22,000 grey-headed flying foxes roosted in the Palm Grove and Gardens. The former was their favoured spot. They killed 28 mature trees, 30 palms and many understorey plants. The Royal Botanic Gardens and Domain Trust commenced a successful flying-fox relocation programme in 2012.\n\nIn July 2015 the Minister announced organisational changes to transform the Royal Botanic Gardens and Domain Trust into a more efficient and responsive organisation. He revealed the name of the new Biome project will be \"The Calyx\", which opened in 2016. He also announced a 26% increase in agency budget over 2014–15 estimates.\n\nIn 2016 the Royal Botanic Garden celebrated its 200 years anniversary with various events to commemorate key educational, horticultural, scientific and cultural experiences of those two centuries. Fireworks displays ushering in the New Year, significant new exhibitions and collaborations with other cultural institutions. \n\nThe Garden comes under the responsibility of the Royal Botanic Gardens and Domain Trust, established in 1980 by act of the New South Wales Parliament. The \"Domain Leasing Act\" 1961 was repealed and An Act to constitute the Royal Botanic Gardens and Domain Trust was passed, defining its powers, authorities, duties and functions. The trust is also responsible for the adjoining public open space of The Domain as well as the Australian Botanic Garden Mount Annan in western Sydney and the Blue Mountains Botanic Garden Mount Tomah in the Blue Mountains. While the Trustees provide oversight of the lands under legislative guidelines, the day-to-day operational management of the Garden is undertaken by staff. In 2014 it was announced that the Royal Botanic Gardens and Domain Trust would be known as the Botanic Gardens & Centennial Parklands, widening responsibilities to take in the heritage-listed Centennial Parklands that includes Centennial, Moore and Queens parks.\n\nThe Royal Botanic Garden consist of of closely cultivated land surrounded by of open parklands comprising The Sydney Domain. The Garden forms a large natural amphitheatre, wrapped around and sloping down towards the 'stage' of Farm Cove. It is divided into four major precincts called the Lower Gardens, the Middle Gardens, the Palace Gardens and the Bennelong precinct. Within the four major precincts are many smaller gardens and features as well as large amounts of lightly wooded lawn areas. Located approximately in the middle of the four precincts is the Palm Grove Centre which offers a restaurant, cafe, visitors centre and bookshop. A large and complex public botanic garden, largely of late 19th-century character; being not only an historic site of the first importance but containing within it numerous structures which have been nominated separately by the National Trust of Australia (NSW). A predominantly nineteenth century character of landscape layout strengthened by large mature trees. Traditionally designated as four areas reflecting its development.\n\nThe single most distinct landscape feature in the Garden is the historic hand-hewn sandstone seawall that curves around Farm Cove from Mrs Macquarie's Point to the Opera House, delineating the garden from the harbour and providing a focal point for visitors, joggers and photographers.\n\nThe layout of the Gardens is exceptionally important, each area (the Middle garden, the Lower Garden, the Palace Lawn etc.) reflects an important stage in the development of the Garden and the current fashion in landscape design almost from the founding of the colony. The squared beds of the Middle Garden are traditionally believed to reflect the first furrows and shortly thereafter the first garden plots of the new settlement. The old Garden Palace grounds is the area bordering Macquarie Street and the Conservatorium of Music (former Government House stables). The Middle Garden is the first farm site. The Upper garden comprises the southern section housing administrative offices and National Herbarium on Mrs Macquarie's road as well as the nursery and depot area bordering the Cahill Expressway. The Lower Garden comprises the rest of the area extending north of the Middle Garden to Farm Cove.\n\nThe Garden Palace grounds being the highest point have excellent views and are maintained as lawn areas, garden beds, Australian shrubs and turf species. The area was originally enclosed by a paling fence for grazing the Governor's stock. An ornamental fence was constructed along Macquarie Street and in the grounds stood the Garden Palace built 1879 which was destroyed by fire in 1882.\n\nThe Middle Garden is now the most closely cultivated section of the gardens where both native and exotic species are well labelled. It included the spring walk famous for its azalea display, one of the finest collections of outdoor palms in the world and a 1970s succulent garden. Some of the Lower Garden was laid out by Charles Fraser and features ponds which are frequented by waterfowl including Australian Black Swans which breed successfully in the environment.\n\nCharles Moore directed the reclamation of and expansion of the \"Lower Garden\" into Farm Cove, extending the gardens' pleasure grounds with curving pleasure walks, tree and shrubbery plantings. This work took place over 30 years, resulting in a gardenesque parkland which retains much of its original layout and composition today. Within this layout there are collections of plants of note, including from the Canary Islands, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands. The lower gardens feature the Band Lawn, the main Ponds, the HSBC Oriental Garden, the Yurong, Victoria Lodge, Henry Lawson Gates and the Maiden Pavilion.\nThe long rectangular beds have evolved from the rectangular beds of the earliest garden. The land before the first Government House and Bennelong Point was laid out in the manner of an English park, the Botanic Garden was treated in a purely functional way. The gate in the wall which Macquarie had completed in 1816 to protect the garden from the harbour, and which now separates the Middle and Lower Gardens. Fraser's plantings in what is now called the \"Palm Grove\", made between 1827–8 from his Brisbane district and northern NSW travels survive, and include hoop pines (\"Araucaria cunninghamii\"), weeping lilly pillies (\"Waterhousia floribunda\"), a hoop pine (\"Araucaria cunninghamii\"), two swamp oaks (\"Casuarina cunninghamiana\") on the eastern side of the palm grove. On his death in 1831 he was succeeded by Richard Cunningham. His brother, the explorer Allan Cunningham, was also a director. A native red cedar Fraser collected in 1822 formerly thought to have been from the Parramatta region has been genetically tested and found to have been collected in the Dorrigo region. This tree grows still near the Palm House (beside Farm Cove Creek in Bed 9).\n\nCharles Moore planted the Palm Grove which has an internationally significant collection of palms and rainforest species in the Middle Garden. \nThe middle gardens feature the Palm House, the Wollemi Pine, the Succulent Garden, the Rare and Threatened Plant Garden, the Herbarium & Plant Sciences Building, the Lion Gate Lodge, the Begonia Garden and the Macquarie Wall and Spring Walk.\nThe Palace Gardens feature the Calyx, the Rainforest Walk, the Pioneer Garden, the Morshead Fountain Gate, the Palace Garden Gate, the Rose Garden & Pavilion, the Turf Plots, the Old Mill Garden, the Herb Garden and the Sydney Conservatorium of Music.\nThe Bennelong Precinct contains Government House, the Parade Ground, the Australian Native Rockery, Bennelong Lawn and the Queen Elizabeth II Gate.\nThe Palm Grove Centre features the Palm Grove itself, a Cafe, Garden Shop and the Botanic Gardens Restaurant.\n\nThe library at the Royal Botanic Gardens was established in 1852. It is named after Daniel Solander (1733–1782) who was a student of Linnaeus and held positions at the British Museum, including working in the library. He was employed in 1768 by Joseph Banks to accompany him on HMS \"Endeavour\" on James Cook's first voyage to the Pacific. On their return to England in 1771 he became Banks' botanist and librarian.\n\nThe library is the oldest botanical research library in Australia. The library has a collection of horticultural, botanic and taxonomic literature and is located within the National Herbarium of New South Wales which has samples collected by Banks and Solander on the voyage with James Cook amongst more than 1.2 million plant specimens.\n\nThe Royal Botanic Garden was for decades home to a large colony of native Grey-headed Flying Foxes, a large species of fruit bat. The colony (estimated to be over 20,000 strong at times) caused significant damage to the trees used for roosting, especially around the Palm Grove Centre where dozens of historic trees were killed or severely damaged.\n\nIn May 2010 the trust announced a plan to evict the colony from the gardens by driving them away with repeated playing of extremely loud recorded noise. This plan was subsequently held up for several years by court action instigated by an animal welfare group but approval was finally given to the trust to proceed in June 2012. By June 2013 the bats had entirely left the Garden and the damaged trees had started to recover.\n\nIn an ironic coda, many of the bats displaced from the garden were found to have moved to a native bushland site on the north coast of New South Wales which was scheduled to be destroyed for an upgrade of the Pacific Highway, the main road linking Sydney with Brisbane. The destruction of the forest and displacement of that colony became a publicly contentious environment-versus-development issue in early 2014 and the building of the road was delayed pending a court-ordered federal government environmental assessment.\n\nAs at 22 September 1998, the Royal Botanic Garden and The Domain collectively are of exceptional national, state and local significance as:\n\n\n\nThe Royal Botanic Garden, Sydney, is of exceptional national, state and local significance as one of the earliest surviving colonial botanic gardens in the world and one of the richest and most extensive early public cultural landscapes in Australia with substantially intact major precincts that are nationally rare from a historic, scientific, aesthetic and social perspective.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Royal Botanic Garden and The Domain also have exceptional historical significance as:\n\nThe Botanic Garden and The Domain demonstrate strong or special associations with the life and works of persons, groups of persons of importance in NSW's cultural and natural history, including:\n\nThe Botanic Garden and The Domain have aesthetic significance for the following reasons:\n\nThe Botanic Garden and The Domain have scientific significance as:\n\nThe Botanic Garden and The Domain have social significance for the following reasons:\n\nThe Botanic Garden and The Domain are identified in the Archaeological Zoning Plan for Central Sydney as an Area of Archaeological Potential, with the potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of NSW's cultural or natural history. It is an area potentially rich in archaeological remains, dating from Aboriginal occupation and the earliest years of the establishment of the colony.\n\nThe Central Depot is of historical significance for its previous use as the kitchen garden associated with Government House (1813–1870) and its ongoing historic use as a centre for plant propagation, cultivation and display serving the Royal Botanic Garden, Sydney. It contains several rare late 19th and early 20th century glasshouses, and retains evidence of their original heating systems. The Central Depot is of research significance for its archaeological potential.\n\nThe archaeology within the Central Depot belongs to all of the identified time frames of the overall statement of archaeological significance for the Botanic Gardens. The early remains of the first farm, and the Macquaries' landscaping of the Domain all built by convicts, are of exceptional State heritage significance. Other archaeological evidence, glasshouses and the boiler room equipment and such, associated with the development of the Botanic Garden can contribute to the story of the Garden and has high Local archaeological significance.\n\nThe Tarpeian Way is of State significance for its prominence as a quarried, weathered sandstone cliff face, with stone steps and iron railing, which defines the northern boundary of the Royal Botanic Garden and the southern boundary of the Sydney Opera House. The drama, scale and simplicity of the quarried sandstone face of theTarpeian Wall plays a crucial role in supporting the entry point and setting of the Sydney Opera House, where it provides an enclosing \"backstage wall\" to the open forecourt space. It is considered a \"crucial element in [the World Heritage] Buffer Zone . . . including its steps and upper perimeter fence. Although not legally on the Sydney Opera House site, it immediately borders and defines its southern edge and the open space of the forecourt. Because of its scale, location and configuration, it plays a crucial role in the approach and entry experience, setting, and definition, of the Sydney Opera House site.\"\n\nA substantial rock cutting of the Bennelong headland, undertaken in 1880 at a cost of , it enabled the extension of Macquarie Street. 'Its vertical quarried sandstone face, with its steps and fence, is an historic artefact in its own right and retains the only visible evidence of activities on the Sydney Opera House site predating the Opera House itself.' Its traces of anti-Vietnam War graffiti dating from the 1970s are of State significance as a remnant of an important Australian social movement in a major public space. The Tarpeian Way is of local significance for its associations with politicians and bureaucrats who authorised and undertook the cutting in 1880 including Sydney Alderman C. Moore, J. S. Farnell, then Minister for Lands, E. Bradridge, City Surveyor and Mr. Moriarty, the Engineer for Harbours and Rivers. The Tarpeian Way has an unusually dramatic, classical association through its name with the famous rock in Rome from which prisoners were hurled to their deaths in ancient times. The Tarpeian Way is of State social significance for the high regard in which it is held as a dramatic backdrop to the forecourt space of the Sydney Opera House, and as an access point between the Sydney Opera House and the Royal Botanic Garden. It is often used by members of the public enjoying its marvellous views of the Sydney Opera House and harbour setting.\n\nThe Royal Botanic Garden and The Domain were listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.\n\nThe second oldest botanic garden in the southern hemisphere, the only older one being Rio de Janeiro.

{"id": "1803851", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1803851", "title": "Financial contagion", "text": "Financial contagion\n\nFinancial contagion refers to \"the spread of market disturbances mostly on the downside from one country to the other, a process observed through co-movements in exchange rates, stock prices, sovereign spreads, and capital flows\". Financial contagion can be a potential risk for countries who are trying to integrate their financial system with international financial markets and institutions. It helps explain an economic crisis extending across neighboring countries, or even regions.\n\nFinancial contagion happens at both the international level and the domestic level. At the domestic level, usually the failure of a domestic bank or financial intermediary triggers transmission when it defaults on interbank liabilities and sells assets in a fire sale, thereby undermining confidence in similar banks.\nAn example of this phenomenon is the subsequent turmoil in the United States financial markets. International financial contagion, which happens in both advanced economies and developing economies, is the transmission of financial crisis across financial markets for direct or indirect economies. However, under today's financial system, with the large volume of cash flow, such as hedge fund and cross-regional operation of large banks, financial contagion usually happens simultaneously both among domestic institutions and across countries. The cause of financial contagion usually is beyond the explanation of real economy, such as the bilateral trade volume.\n\nThe term financial contagion has created controversy throughout the past years. Some argue that strong linkages between countries are not necessarily financial contagion, and that financial contagion should be defined as an increase in cross-market linkages after a shock to one country, which is very hard to figure out by both theoretical model and empirical work. Also, some scholars argue that there is actually no contagion at all, just a high level of market co-movement in all periods, which is market \"interdependence\".\n\nMore generally, there is controversy surrounding the usefulness of \"contagion\" as a metaphor to describe the \"catchiness\" of social phenomena, as well as debate about the application of context-specific models and concepts from biomedicine and epidemiology to explain the diffusion of perturbations within financial systems.\n\nFinancial contagion can create financial volatility and can seriously damage the economy and financial systems of countries. There are several branches of classifications that explain the mechanism of financial contagion, which are spillover effects and financial crisis that are caused by the influence of the four agents' behavior. The four agents that influence financial globalization are governments, financial institutions, investors, and borrowers.\n\nThe first branch, spill-over effects, can be seen as the negative externalities. Spillover effects are also known as fundamental-based contagion. These effects can happen either globally, heavily affecting many countries in the world, or regionally, affecting only neighboring countries. The big players, who are more of the larger countries, usually have a global effect. The smaller countries are the players who usually have a regional effect. \"These forms of co-movements would not normally constitute contagion, but if they occur during a period of crisis and their effect is adverse, they may be expressed as contagion.\"\n\n\"Fundamental causes of contagion include macroeconomic shocks that have repercussions on an international scale and local shocks transmitted through trade links, competitive devaluations, and financial links.\" It can lead to some co-movements in capital flows and asset prices.Common shocks can be similar to the effects of financial links. \"A financial crisis in one country can lead to direct financial effects, including reductions in trade credits, foreign direct investment, and other capital flows abroad.\" Financial links come from financial globalization since countries try to be more economically integrated with global financial markets. Allen and Gale (2000), and Lagunoff and Schreft (2001) analyze financial contagion as a result of linkages among financial intermediaries. The former provide a general equilibrium model to explain a small liquidity preference shock in one region can spread by contagion throughout the economy and the possibility of contagion depends strongly on the completeness of the structure of interregional claims. The latter proposed a dynamic stochastic game-theoretic model of financial fragility, through which they explain interrelated portfolios and payment commitments forge financial linkages among agents and thus make two related types of the financial crisis can occur in response.\n\nTrade links is another type of shock that has its similarities to common shocks and financial links. These types of shocks are more focused on its integration causing local impacts. \"Any major trading partner of a country in which a financial crisis has induced a sharp current depreciation could experience declining asset prices and large capital outflows or could become the target of a speculative attack as investors anticipate a decline in exports to the crisis country and hence a deterioration in the trade account.\" Kaminsky and Reinhart (2000) document the evidence that trade links in goods and services and exposure to a common creditor can explain earlier crises clusters, not only the debt crisis of the early 1980s and 1990s, but also the observed historical pattern of contagion.\n\nCompetitive devaluation is also associated with financial contagion. Competitive devaluation, which is also known as a currency war, is when multiple countries compete against one another to gain a competitive advantage by having low exchange rates for their currency. \"Devaluation in a country hit by a crisis reduces the export competitiveness of the countries with which it competes in third markets, putting pressure on the currencies of other countries; especially when those currencies do not float freely.\" This action causes countries to act irrationally due to fear and doubt. \"If market participants expect that a currency crisis will lead to a game of competitive devaluation, they will naturally sell their holdings of securities of other countries, curtail their lending, or refuse to roll over short-term loans to borrowers in those countries.\"\n\nAnother branch of contagion is a financial crisis, which is also referred to irrational phenomena. A financial crisis as a branch of contagion is formed when \"a co-movement occurs, even when there are no global shocks and interdependence and fundamentals are not factors.\" It is caused by any of the four agents' behaviors who influence financial globalization. Some examples that can cause contagion are increased risk aversion, lack of confidence, and financial fears. Under the correlated information channel, price changes in one market are perceived as having implications for the values of assets in other markets, causing their prices to change as well (King and Wadhwani (1990)). Also, Calvo (2004) argues for correlated liquidity shock channel meaning that when some market participants need to liquidate and withdraw some of their assets to obtain cash, perhaps after experiencing an unexpected loss in another country and need to restore capital adequacy ratios. This behavior will effectively transmit the shock.\n\nOut of the four agents, an investor's behavior seems to be one of the biggest one that can impact a country's financial system. There are three different types of investor behaviors, which generally are considered rational or irrational and individually or collectively.\n\nThe first type of behavior is when \"investors take action that is ex-ante individually rational but lead to excessive co-movements excessive in the sense that they cannot be explained by real fundamentals.\" It breaks down into two sub-categories, liquidity and incentive problems and information asymmetries and coordination problems. The first sub-category is liquidity and incentive problems. A reduction of equity prices can result in a loss of money for investors. \"These losses may induce investors to sell off securities in other markets to raise cash in anticipation of a higher frequency of redemptions.\" These liquidity problems are also challenges for banks, specifically commercial banks.Incentive problems can also have the same effects as liquidity problems. For instance, the first signs of a crisis may cause investors to sell their holdings in some countries, resulting in equity and different asset markets in economies to decline in value. This causes the value of currencies in these economies to also decrease. The second sub-category is information asymmetries and coordination problems. This type of investor behavior can either be considered rational or irrational. This sub-category is when one group, or country, has more or significantly better information compared to another group or country. This can cause a market failure problem, which could potentially cause a financial crisis.\n\nThe second type of investor behavior concentrates on multiple equilibriums. It focuses on the investor's behavioral changes when the financial market can have multiple equilibrium changes. Thus, \"contagion occurs when a crisis in one financial market causes another financial market to move or jump to a bad equilibrium, characterized by a devaluation, a drop in asset prices, capital outflows, or debt default.\" The third type of behavior is when there is a change in the international financial system, or in the rules of the game. It can make investors adjust their behaviors after a financial transaction occurs internationally or an initial crisis occurs. These behaviors can lead to spillover effect, causing contagion.\n\nIn addition, there are some less-developed explanations for financial contagion. Some explanations for financial contagion, especially after the Russian default in 1998, are based on changes in investor \"psychology\", \"attitude\", and \"behavior\". This stream of research date back to early studies of crowd psychology of Mackay (1841) and classical early models of disease diffusion were applied to financial markets by Shiller (1984). Also, Kirman (1993) analyses a simple model of influence that is motivated by the foraging behavior of ants, but applicable, he argues, to the behaviour of stock market investors. Faced with a choice between two identical piles of food, ants switch periodically from one pile to the other. Kirman supposes that there are N ants and that each switch randomly between piles with probability ε (this prevents the system getting stuck with all at one pile or the other), and imitates a randomly chosen other ant with probability δ. Eichengreen, Hale and Mody (2001) focus on the transmission of recent crises through the market for developing country debt. They find the impact of changes in market sentiment tends to be limited to the original region. They also find market sentiments can more influence prices but less on quantities in Latin America, compared with Asian countries.\n\nBesides, there are some researches on geographic factors driving the contagion. De Gregorio and Valdes (2001) examine how the 1982 debt crisis, the 1994 Mexican crisis, and the 1997 Asian crisis spread to a sample of twenty other countries. They find that a neighborhood effect is the strongest determinant of which countries suffer from contagion. Trade links and pre-crisis growth similarities are also important, although to a lesser extent than the neighborhood effect.\n\nThe term \"contagion\" was first introduced in July 1997, when the currency crisis in Thailand quickly spread throughout East Asia and then on to Russia and Brazil. Even developed markets in North America and Europe were affected, as the relative prices of financial instruments shifted and caused the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), a large U.S. hedge fund. The financial crisis beginning from Thailand with the collapse of the Thai baht spread to Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, South Korea and Hong Kong in less than 2 months. This caused economists to realize the importance of financial contagion and produced a large volume of researches on it. Yet, there were episodes of international financial crisis that occurred before the introduction of the term contagion.\n\nSome analysts, including Bordo and Murshid, identify the crisis that happened in 1825 as the first international financial crisis. \"The liberation of Latin American in the early 1820s led to a massive inflow of capital from Britain to finance the exploitation of gold and silver mines and of sovereign loans to the newly independent republics.\" Between new industries beginning to grow, an increase in foreign influence, and a liberal monetary expansion after the Napoleonic Wars, there was an increase in irrationality on the London Stock Exchange. As a result, the bank decided to increase its discount rate. The stock market crashed in October, which triggered a banking crisis around December. This crisis spread throughout the continent. \"This crisis spread to Latin America as the overseas loans were cut off, a decline in investment and exports reduced tax revenues and led to sovereign debt defaults across the region.\"\n\nOne of the biggest worldwide crises was the stock market crash on Wall Street in October 1929. The failure from 1929–33 was foreshadowed by collapses in commodity prices in multiple emerging nations. The stock market boom in New York by 1928 choked off U.S. capital flows to central Europe and Latin America and precipitated currency crises in a number of countries (Australia, Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil) and early in 1929. The Wall Street crash caused stock market scares globally. This is known as the Great Depression. The U.S. crisis in 1929 turned into the Great Depression by 1930 and 1931 because the Federal Reserve was unsuccessful at relieving multiple banking panics. The resultant collapse in prices and output worldwide forced sovereign borrowers to cut back on servicing their debts and then to default, precipitating a collapse of foreign lending in 1931.\n\nOne of the contributors to the 1997 Asian financial crisis was excessive borrowing by national banks. National banks continuously borrowed from countries abroad and continuously lent within their own country. At the time, it did not seem excessive, but it appeared so in the aftermath. Bad loans were made, risks were taken due to misunderstandings, and the level of debt continued to grow. \"After the start of the crisis, national equity betas increased and average returns fell substantially\". The first currency that faced problems was the Thai baht. With the Thai baht having issues, it doubled the debt of Thai organizations, which started the spread of the crisis to other countries. As this was happening, investors started reevaluating their investments in this region. This caused the flow of money to disappear rapidly, resulting in the growth of this crisis.\n\nThe crisis of 2007–08 has been identified as the most severe since the 1930 Great Depression. Major financial institutions around the world were greatly affected. The history of the 2007–08 crisis traces back to the bursting of the housing bubble in the United States, and the increase in mortgage defaults. This came about as a result of the mandate by the U.S. Congress for the Federal National Mortgage to increase access to low-income housing. As a result of the high default rates, many financial institutions across the U.S. were affected. Although the U.S. government had attempted to salvage the situation through liquidity doses, the crisis further deepened. By March 2008, Bear Sterns, a U.S. investment bank, required the efforts of the government to be rescued. At this stage, it was clear that the crisis had deepened. Other financial institutions, such as the Lehman bank and American International Group (AIG), started to feel the effects of the crisis. The severity of this crisis grew, and most U.S. and European banks were pulling back their international loans. This move caused major financial problems across the world, especially for those countries that rely heavily on international borrowing. Financial contagion was felt severely, especially in countries whose financial systems were vulnerable due to local housing bubbles and current account deficits. Some of the countries affected were Germany, Iceland, Spain, Britain and New Zealand among others. Many analysts and governments had failed to predict the real effects of the crisis. As major economies of the world started to feel the effects of the crisis, nearly every economy was affected directly or indirectly. In particular, there was a drop in exports and a lowering of commodity prices.\n\nFinancial contagion is one of the main causes of financial regulation. A top priority for both domestic financial regulators and international organizations is to prevent financial contagion using financial regulation and planning the international financial architecture. This priority was especially important during the 2007-2008 period, when global economies were under challenge from the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis and European sovereign debt crisis.\n\nAt the international level, under today's modern financial systems, a complicated web of claims and obligations link the balance sheets of a wide variety of intermediaries, such as hedge funds and banks, into a global financial network. The development of sophisticated financial products, such as credit default swaps and collateralized debt obligations, has complicated the financial regulation. As has been shown by the U.S. financial recession, the trigger of failure of Lehman Brothers dramatically spread the shock to the whole financial system and other financial markets. Therefore, understanding the reasons and mechanisms of international financial contagion can help policy makers improve the global financial regulation system and thus make it more resistant to shocks and contagions.\n\nAt domestic level, financial fragility is always associated with a short maturity of outstanding debt as well as contingent public liabilities. Therefore, a better domestic financial regulation structure can improve an economy's liquidity and limit its exposure to contagion. A better understanding of financial contagion between financial intermediaries, including banking, rating agencies and hedge funds will be conducive to making financial reform in both U.S. and European Countries. For example, financial reformers study how to set up the capital ratio to balance maximizing banks' profit and shielding banks from shocks and contagions.\n\nThe econometric literature on testing for contagion has focused on increases in the correlation of returns between markets during periods of crisis. Forbes and Rigobon (2002) described the current imprecision and disagreement surrounding the term contagion. It proposes a concrete definition, a significant increase in cross-market linkages after a shock, and suggests using the term \"interdependence\" in order to differentiate this explicit definition from the existing literature. It shows the elementary weakness of simple correlation tests: with an unchanged regression coefficient, a rise in the variance of the explanatory variable reduces the coefficient standard error, causing a rise in the correlation of a regression. \n\nLet formula_1 is the set of financial assets and formula_2 be the price of asset formula_3 at time formula_4. A network with contagion is defined in matrix form as formula_5, whose formula_6 component represents the connection between two stocks formula_7 and formula_8. In vector notation, the standard model for contagion tests can be written as a VAR (vector autoregression) model of order formula_9:\n\nwhere formula_11 is a random term. In their specific application, Forbes and Rigobon (2002) estimated a variant of this model to study contagion between countries. They first estimated the variance-covariance matrices for each pair of countries during the stable period, turmoil period, and full period. Then, they use the estimated variance-covariance matrices to calculate the cross-market correlation coefficients (and their asymptotic distributions) for each set of markets and periods.\n\nAs Pesaran and Pick (2007) observe, however, financial contagion is a difficult system to estimate econometrically. To disentangle contagion from interaction effects, county-specific variables have to be used to instrument foreign returns. Choosing the crisis period introduces sample selection bias, and it has to be assumed that crisis periods are sufficiently long to allow correlations to be reliably estimated. In consequence, there appears to be no strong consensus in the empirical literature as to whether contagion occurs between markets, or how strong it is.\n\nThe financial and economic literature presents ample evidence that in time of crisis co-movements between the returns of assets increase. This increase in correlation between the returns of the loans' collateral causes an increase in the volatility of bank assets and, therefore an increase in the value of the bank's stock and its cost of default, while decreasing the value of its debt. The increase in correlation can be explained by a procyclical forbearance policy of regulators. Since regulators have greater forbearance during systemic crises, the increase in correlation creates incentives for banks to herd and become interconnected so that when they fail, they fail together, increasing their chances of being bailed-out. Peleg and Raviv (2018) shows that as the correlation between the returns of bank's borrowers' increases, asset risk increases as well. Thus an increase in co-movement of a bank's loan portfolio increases the bank's cost of default through a second channel: an increase in risk shifting.\n\nRecently, Nasini and Erdemlioglu have proposed a model to study how the effects on stock price dynamics of different network propagation channels vary according to the state of the economy. Drawing on the view that decisions and outcomes of financial firms are influenced by multiple network channels, they studied the stock price dynamics of listed enterprises connected by supply-chain relationships, competition linkages and business partnerships. \n\nLet formula_12 be the market value of asset formula_3, defined as the share price times the number of shares outstanding: formula_14. At each moment in time formula_4, a network with connection of type formula_16 is defined in matrix form as formula_17, whose formula_6 component represents the formula_19 connection between two stocks formula_7 and formula_8. Define formula_22, where formula_23 quantifies the difference between the market value of formula_7 and formula_8. The financial econometric model of Nasini and Erdemlioglu can be written as\n\nwhere formula_27 is a random term. They derived an important relationship between this model and the classical Fama–French three-factor model. Let formula_28, and formula_29 and formula_30 be the maximum and the minimum market capitalization among the formula_31 listed enterprises at time formula_4 and consider formula_33 (small minus big) and formula_34 (small over big). When formula_35, well known properties of the log-normal distribution implies\n\nwhere formula_37. Similarly, when formula_35, \n\nNext to it, their approach allows decomposing the financial dynamics into networks propagation and firms structural positions effects.\n\n"}

They were hailed as the highest level of exchange between the Communist Party of China and the Kuomintang since Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong met in Chongqing, China on August 28, 1945.\n\nOn March 28, 2005, the Kuomintang's vice chairman Chiang Pin-kung led a delegation in the first official visit to mainland China by a senior leader of the Kuomintang in 60 years. Later, on April 26, 2005, a 70-member delegation led by the Kuomintang's chairman Lien Chan left Taipei for the ROC's \"de jure\" capital of Nanjing via Hong Kong, launching Lien's 8-day Taiwan Strait peace tour; also the first such visit to mainland China in 60 years.\n\nWhile in mainland China, Lien met with General Secretary Hu Jintao and expressed interest in improving cross-strait dialogues. Both also re-affirmed a belief in the \"One China principle\", which was not acknowledged by Taiwan's then-ruling party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP); a part of Taiwan's Pan-Green Coalition.\n\nLien's itinerary also included visits to Xi'an, where he had lived as a child during the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II; Nanjing, the official capital of the Republic of China and the site of the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum; and Shanghai, China's largest city and site of extensive Taiwanese financial and economic investment in recent years.\n\nIn 2004, the KMT first proposed that the former president candidate Lien Chan would visit mainland China as the elected President of the Republic of China, but this was set aside as Lien failed to win the 2004 ROC Presidential Election. In 2005, the KMT suggested initially sending the vice chairman of the party to mainland China, with further visits to follow. This plan was followed through on March 28, when Vice Chairman Chiang Pin-kung led his delegation to mainland China.\n\nAs part of the \"ice-breaking tour\", Chiang started his trip in Guangzhou to visit the graves of dozens of KMT members who died during an uprising against the Qing Dynasty in 1911. On the morning of March 30, the delegation visited the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing, then headed for Beijing to meet with CPPCC chairman Jia Qinglin. At the meeting, Jia conveyed Hu Jintao's invitation for Lien to Chiang. On April 1, Lien accepted the invitation at the Aichi Expo 2005.\n\nLien Chan and his 70-member delegation departed Taipei for Hong Kong on April 26, starting the 8-day \"\"journey of peace\"\" which the mainland Chinese media referred to as a \"visit.\" The Chinese media changed the airport name from \"Chiang Kai-Shek International Airport\" airport to \"Taoyuan airport\" to avoid mentioning the name of former leader of KMT and the late President of the Republic of China, Chiang Kai-shek.\n\nOn that morning, about a thousand people gathered at the Chiang Kai-shek International Airport, and violent conflict broke out among the supporters and opponents of the tour, resulting in many injuries.\n\nSome Pan-Green supporters illegally brought \"guan daos\", beer bottles, stones, eggs, firecrackers, clubs, and sharpened sugarcanes into the terminals and started beating Pan-Blue supporters and the police, throwing stones and setting off firecrackers in the meantime. Many members of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), and the Taiwan Independence Party were arrested, along with the host of a political talk show.\n\nPan-Blue supporters fought back, swearing \"an eye for an eye\". There were suspected Triad members clad in black in the mob, picking on Pan-Green's supporters, causing many to be hospitalized. The New Party chairman Yok Mu-ming was arrested, along with other people in the Pan-Blue Coalition.\n\nOutside the airport, a few taxis attempted to blockade the highway, preventing Lien from reaching the airport, but they were repelled by the motorcade's police escort. Taiwan independence advocate Shi Ming and pan-Green supporters lit firecrackers in front of the terminal, but were not arrested.\n\nLien avoided the trouble entirely having been taken into the airport via a VIP entrance.\n\nBecause the Aviation Police Office of Taiwan proved inept in handling the riot, its director, Chen Jui-tien was dismissed that evening. The Minister of the Interior, Su Jia-chyuan offered to resign, but the offer was rejected by Premier Frank Hsieh.\n\nOn the Internet, teenagers parodied the event with a mock \"Dynasty Warriors\" battle.\n\nThe delegation transferred onto China Eastern Airlines to Nanjing in Hong Kong, where they were greeted by the PRC Liaison Office of Hong Kong.\n\nLien and the delegation arrived at Nanjing Lukou International Airport on April 26, at 16:40. Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council head Chen Yunlin was at the airport to welcome the delegation. One of Lien's aides, Joanna Lai, quipped \"It would have taken just two and half hours from Taipei to Nanjing by direct flight, but we took 50-60 years.\" Lien echoed the sentiment in a short speech upon arrival, saying \"Taipei and Nanjing are not too distant, but it still took 60 years to come here. It certainly took too long to make the journey.\" That night he attended a banquet hosted by the leader of the Jiangsu provincial government and lodged at the Jinling Hotel.\n\nOn April 27, the delegation visited the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, where Lien burnt incense for the former President surrounded by the general public and press reporters. Lien quoted Sun Yat-Sen's last words \"\"peace, struggle, save China\"\" to promote a healthy relationship across the strait. Lien was the first KMT chairman to visit the mausoleum for 56 years.\n\nOn the same day, Lien visited the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum, the former Republic of China Presidential Palace, Tianfei Gong, and the Fuzi Miao (Shrine of Confucius).\n\nOn the morning of April 28, Lien left Nanjing for Beijing.\n\nIn the afternoon of April 28, Lien and the delegation arrived in the Beijing Capital International Airport, where he delivered another speech. Then he attended a conference with the Taiwan Affairs Office in the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse. Later, the delegation visited the Forbidden City. Lien met the CPPCC Chairman Jia Qinglin at the Great Hall of the People, and then watched a traditional Beijing opera performance.\n\nOn April 29, Lien gave a speech and answered questions from students and faculty in Peking University. The speech called for a 'win-win' future of cooperation and peace, praising both Deng Xiaoping and Chiang Ching-kuo as having made pivotal decisions that led to economic growth.\n\nIn the speech, he also mentioned that both Hu Shih and former National Taiwan University president Fu Sinian had graduated from Peking University, then worked at Taiwan University and spread liberalism there. \"Therefore, in terms of liberalism, both Peking University and Taiwan University are born from the same root. Especially in mainland China, it can be said that it's a bastion of freedom.\" But a proportion of Taiwanese students disagreed, saying both Hu and Fu were fierce opponents of communism in favor of freedom of education, and thus the two universities can't be compared, and protested outside the front gate.\n\nLien then toured the university, and visited the dormitory where his mother once lived. At 15:00, Lien met Hu Jintao in the Great Hall of the People, marking a historical meeting between the Communist Party of China and the Kuomintang, the first since 1945. After 17:30, Lien held a press conference, and listed the five points of compromise settled upon by the two parties following the conference:\n\n\nThat evening, Lien changed his plan for the night and met with Hu Jintao again. Reportedly, Hu Jintao invited Lien for a politics-free chat as it was Lien's last night in Beijing.\n\nOn April 30 at 11:25, the delegation arrived at Xi'an Xianyang International Airport, starting Lien's tour of his birthplace. Welcoming Lien were officials of the Shaanxi provincial government, Taiwanese businessmen in mainland China, and children from Lien's elementary school.\n\nAt 3 pm Lien returned to Houzaimen Elementary School (then called Beixinjie Elementary), which he had attended 60 years ago. There he gave a speech and watched several presentations by the schoolchildren, among them the soon-famous \"\" skit reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution. Lien later donated to the school library, and the school gave him a long wall scroll in return.\n\nAfter visiting the school, the delegation visited the Terracotta Army. In the evening, Shaanxi provincial secretary Li Jianguo hosted a Tang Dynasty-style banquet for the delegation in the Tang Paradise theme park. Li presented the delegation with prints from the Stele Forest and ancient copperware, Lien in return gave famous Taiwanese glasswork. Later, the delegation watched the musical \"Dream Back to the Tang\" in the Fengming Jiutian Theatre.\n\nLien and his family members visited his grandmother's grave in Xi'an on May 1, and burnt incense at the nearby Qingliang Temple.\n\nAt 5pm on May 1, Lien arrived at Shanghai Pudong International Airport.\n\nThe next day, Lien cancelled his trip atop the Oriental Pearl Tower and held a press conference at the Shanghai Shangri-la Hotel. He later visited Wang Daohan at Jinjiang Hotel. At nine he toured Xintiandi, and took a harbor cruise to view The Bund at night.\n\nOn May 3, 1pm, Lien and his delegation flew back to Taipei, via Hong Kong.\n\nThe state media in mainland China covered the visit in great detail and much of the general public welcomed this delegation with enthusiasm.\n\nThe United States declared public support for Lien's visit, stating \"diplomacy is the only way to resolve the cross-strait issue.\" However, the US also stressed that it would like to see the Communist Party of China (CPC) have talks with Taiwan's current ruling party, as well as the KMT. Western political analysts have compared the handshake of Lien and Hu Jintao to that of Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat.\n\nThe European Union also welcomed the visit, stating they \"hope it will prove to be the first positive step in the right direction.\"\n\nIn Taiwan, public opinion was split. While polls showed that more than half of the people didn't oppose this visit, the DPP argued that the People's Republic of China was attempting to play a divide-and-conquer game with Taiwan and causing a \"widening schism\" among the Taiwanese. Former ROC President and TSU affiliate Lee Teng-hui condemned the visits of Lien and Soong (see below), calling them sympathizers of mainland China who want to undermine Taiwan's sovereignty.\n\nRepublic of China (ROC) President Chen Shui-bian initially condemned Lien and said that his visit might be in violation of ROC law. However, several days later Chen Shui-bian reversed his opinions and showed a cautious goodwill gesture to Lien's visit. Chen has also altered his stance on Taiwan independence. While during the 2004 Taiwan election, Chen stressed his support for Taiwanese independence; he now says that \"both independence and re-unification are options\" for Taiwan's future. Political fallout from Lien's trip is believed to have contributed to this change in rhetoric.\n\nAfter Lien's visit, the PRC offered three \"goodwill gifts\" to the ROC: the normalization of tourism, which would allow direct flights across the Taiwan Strait; agricultural trade agreements that would increase sales of Taiwanese produce to mainland China; and two giant pandas for the Taipei Zoo. After much deliberation, authorities in Taiwan declined the final gift, saying that Taipei Zoo was not suited to the task of nurturing pandas. This decision was overturned following the election of Ma Ying-jeou to the presidency in March 2008.\n\nJames Soong, leader of the People First Party, followed Lien's visit on May 5 with a 9-day visit of his own. Like Lien, Soong also met with General Secretary Hu Jintao and expressed an interest in increasing cross-strait dialogue.\n\nPrior to Soong's visit, President Chen extended an invitation to Hu Jintao to visit Taiwan so that he \"can see with his own eyes that Taiwan is a sovereign nation.\" However, the CPC continues to show a lack of interest in dealing with Chen and the DPP.\n\n\n"}

A one-dimensional GRF is also called a Gaussian process. An important special case of a GRF is the Gaussian free field.\n\nWith regard to applications of GRFs, the initial conditions of physical cosmology generated by quantum mechanical fluctuations during cosmic inflation are thought to be a GRF with a nearly scale invariant spectrum.\n\nOne way of constructing a GRF is by assuming that the field is the sum of a large number of plane, cylindrical or spherical waves with uniformly distributed random phase. Where applicable, the central limit theorem dictates that at any point, the sum of these individual plane-wave contributions will exhibit a Gaussian distribution. This type of GRF is completely described by its power spectral density, and hence, through the Wiener-Khinchin theorem, by its two-point autocorrelation function, which is related to the power spectral density through a Fourier transformation. \n\nSuppose \"f\"(\"x\") is the value of a GRF at a point \"x\" in some \"D\"-dimensional space. If we make a vector of the values of \"f\" at \"N\" points, \"x\", ..., \"x\", in the \"D\"-dimensional space, then the vector (\"f\"(\"x\"), ..., \"f\"(\"x\")) will always be distributed as a multivariate Gaussian.\n\n"}
{"id": "1803866", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1803866", "title": "Surveillance abuse", "text": "Surveillance abuse\n\nSurveillance abuse is the use of surveillance methods or technology to monitor the activity of an individual or group of individuals in a way which violates the social norms or laws of a society.\n\nDuring the FBI's COINTELPRO operations, there was widespread surveillance abuse which targeted political dissidents, primarily people from the political left and civil rights movement.\n\nOther abuses include \"LOVEINT\" which refers to the practice of secret service employees using their extensive monitoring capabilities to spy on their love interest or spouse.\n\nThere is no prevention in the amount of unauthorized data collected on individuals and this leads to cases where cameras are installed inappropriately. “For instance, according to the BBC, four council workers in Liverpool used a street CCTV pan-tilt-zoom camera to spy on a woman in her apartment.” (Cavallaro,2007). This is just one case where culprits have been caught; however, there are still many common acts such as this. Another incident of inappropriate installation now has “Pennsylvania parents suing their son's school, alleging it watched him through his laptop's webcam while he was at home and unaware he was being observed.” (Surveillance Camera Players, 2010). This leads to the misconception of surveillance, as it once was a tool to monitor and make sure citizens abide by the law, it has now created even more problems. With cameras only becoming more advanced and more common, it is difficult to determine whether these surveillance cameras are helping to ensure a safe society or leading to bigger issues altogether.\n\nWith the growing of Web 2.0, social networking sites, surveillance may be more easily and commonly abused in many situations for a variety of reasons. The Communications Security Establishment (CSE), formerly known as Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSEC), has previously spied on Canadians through the public wireless internet connections in an airport in the country. Through this they gathered information on who people called or texted and where they were when they communicated with others. The CSE search through approximately 10-15 million downloads daily. An example of where surveillance may have been abused is where Facebook and Apple have admitted to allowing government officials to access personal information of their account users. \n\nA device which may be used to abuse surveillance, called a Stingray, acts and looks similar to a cellphone tower but it tricks mobile devices into connecting with it. After connected an operator can take information stored on the device, sometimes intercepting phone calls and text messages. This method of surveillance can be used on random civilians or in an investigation of a particular person.\n\n\n"}

It is currently used both for high performance athletic training and for recreational purposes by the general public. Canada Olympic Park was one of the venues for the 1988 Winter Olympics, being the primary venue for ski jumping, bobsleigh, and luge. \n\nThe park is located in western Calgary, south of the Trans-Canada Highway, north of the community of Cougar Ridge and west of Bowness.\n\nThe ski resort is one of the best-known legacies of the XV Olympic Winter Games which were held in Calgary in 1988. It was the main venue for bobsleigh, luge (both at the now bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track), nordic combined, ski jumping, freestyle skiing (aerials and ballet).\n\nIn the winter, the park is also used for winter activities including downhill skiing, snowboarding, cross-country skiing, ski jumping, bobsleigh and luge. In the summer, the park is used for warm-weather activities including mountain biking, summer festivals, ski jumping training, zip-lining and summer camps. The park also has a number of indoor facilities which are operated year-round, including arenas, fitness centres, and an indoor ice track.\n\nCanada Olympic Park is a popular place for people looking to go skiing or snowboarding without driving out to the mountains. The hill is divided into three sections, the downhill racing section, the casual section and the terrain park.\n\nThe terrain park is of exceptional quality, and as of 2006, the halfpipe has been enlarged to be an exact replica of the halfpipe that was used for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. Other features of the terrain park include spines, handrail, and tables.\n\nThere are currently 6 lifts that are being used on a regular basis, two four-passenger detachable high-speed chairlift, one four person fixed grip quad, and 4 Magic Carpets. There is also a single chair that provides access to one of the smaller ski jumps, and a double chair (which has been removed), that takes people from the base area to near the base of the 90 m ski jump tower.\n\nCanada Olympic Park relies almost exclusively on man made snow to create skiable terrain. Snowmaking usually begins in early December and depending on weather conditions usually ends in early February. The hill has an arsenal of snowmaking equipment including automated SMI PoleCat fan guns, 'Mckinney' stick guns, and a handful of aging SMI Highland fan guns. An onsight pump station provides high pressure water and air to hydrants located around the hill. When pumping at capacity the park consumes roughly 850,000 L/hr of water.\n\nWinsport also operates a ski jumping facility on the east side of the Canada Olympic Park campus. The facility has six jumps ranging in size from K4 to K95. Of the six jumps at Canada Olympic park three are used year-round (the K18, K38, and K63). The K4 and the K89 jumps are used exclusively in the summer months. The largest jump, the K95 is no longer used for ski jumping and serves exclusively as a party venue. Collectively the facility sees on average 28,000 jumps each year. The majority of which are in the summer months. The Ski Jump venue is home of the Altius Nordic SC club.\n\nIn the summer Canada Olympic Park is open for the sport of mountain biking. The high-speed chairlift is used with bike racks on the chairs. There are numerous trails on the hill's west side, complete with north shore ladder stunts and singletrack trails. The east trees just contain regular trails, with minimal stunts and jumps. COP is also outfitted with a downhill course that holds competitions through the summer. The trails are designed for all riding abilities. Canada Olympic Park also has a large dirt jump park and trials park. Summer sports camps run all summer with activities ranging from luge to ski jumping.\n\nIn 2011, WinSport opened its ice facility that houses four ice rinks (an international ice size arena seating 3000, three NHL-size rinks (the Joan Snyder arena, and arena C & the visitcalgary.com arena)). The arenas have been used for curling, figure skating, power skating (for long and short track speed skating), ringette, and hockey. Also, the arena has hosted concerts, shows, and other sporting events.\n\nDuring the summer of 2013, Hockey Canada held its Olympic orientation camp for perspective Canadian NHL athletes heading to the XXII Olympic Winter Games in Sochi. Due to injury concerns and insurance disputes, drills and scrimmage sessions were held off ice in a \"street hockey/ball hockey\" format.\n\nIn 2014, WinSport completed the Markin-MacPhail Centre. The centre is named after its benefactors Allan Markin and Keith MacPhail. The high-performance centre was designed as a training hub for Canadian athletes who have reached a provincial level of excellence. The center includes the ice arenas, a gymnasium, medical center for treatment and recovery, and an office tower who residences include the National Sport School as well as several national sport federations.\n\nIn October 28, 2008, Calgary was chosen, among nine Canadian cities, to permanently host Canada's Sports Hall of Fame (CSHOF). The foundation and construction of the new facility was laid on donated land by the former Calgary Olympic Development Association (CODA), now called the Canadian Winter Sport Institute or WinSport Canada. The cost of the project was C$50 million (about C$30 million was used to build the venue; another C$20 million for operating costs, through an endowment fund). It was opened to the general public on July 1, 2011, to coincide with the Canada Day festivities. The former \"Olympic Museum and Hall of Fame\" location was turned into a training site for athletes, making it (OMHoF) redundant and the CSHOF the only sports-related museum there.\n\nOn June 11, 2012, City Hall councillors voted against WinSport Canada's multimillion-dollar proposal to have some land at COP's base made into a \"sprawling retail centre\" by a vote of 9–5. However, WinSport has an option of redeveloping the land into smaller projects, over time, which can be \"sustainable.\"\n\n\n"}

In coagulative necrosis the architecture of dead tissue is preserved for at least a couple of days. It is believed that the injury denatures structural proteins as well as lysosomal enzymes thus blocking the proteolysis of the damaged cells. The lack of lysosomal enzymes allows it to maintain a \"coagulated\" morphology for some time. Like most types of necrosis if enough viable cells are present around the affected area regeneration will usually occur.\n\nCoagulative necrosis can also be induced by high local temperature; it is a desired effect of treatments such as high intensity focused ultrasound applied to cancerous cells.\n\nCoagulative necrosis is most commonly caused by conditions that do not involve severe trauma, toxins or an acute or chronic immune response. The lack of oxygen (hypoxia) causes cell death in a localised area which is perfused by blood vessels failing to deliver primarily oxygen, but also other important nutrients. It is important to note that while ischemia in most tissues of the body will cause coagulative necrosis, in the central nervous system ischemia causes liquefactive necrosis, as there is very little structural framework in neural tissue.\n\nThe macroscopic appearance of an area of coagulative necrosis is a pale segment of tissue contrasting against surrounding well vascularised tissue and is dry on cut surface. The tissue may later turn red due to inflammatory response. The surrounding surviving cells can aid in regeneration of the affected tissue unless they are stable or permanent.\n\nThe nucleus is lost and there is cytoplasmic hypereosinophilia on H&E stain.\n\nAs the majority of the structural remnants of the necrotic tissue remains, labile cells adjacent to the affected tissue will replicate and replace the cells which have been killed during the event. Labile cells are constantly undergoing mitosis and can therefore help reform the tissue, whereas nearby stable and permanent cells (e.g. neurons and cardiomyocytes) do not undergo mitosis and will not replace the tissue affected. Fibroblasts will also migrate to the affected area depositing fibrous tissue producing fibrosis or scarring in areas where viable cells do not replicate and replace tissue.\n\n"}

{"id": "1803918", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1803918", "title": "Ion (dialogue)", "text": "Ion (dialogue)\n\nIn Plato's Ion (; ) Socrates discusses with the titular character, a professional rhapsode who also lectures on Homer, the question of whether the rhapsode, a performer of poetry, gives his performance on account of his skill and knowledge or by virtue of divine possession. It is one of the shortest of Plato's dialogues.\n\nIon has just come from a festival of Asclepius at the city of Epidaurus, after having won first prize in the competition. Socrates engages him in discussion and Ion explains how his knowledge and skill is limited to Homer, whom he claims to understand better than anyone alive. Socrates finds this puzzling as to him it seems that Homer treats many of the same subjects as other poets like Hesiod, subjects such as war or divination, and that if someone is knowledgeable in any one of those he should be able to understand what \"both\" of these poets say. Furthermore, this man is probably not the poet, like Ion, but a specialist like a doctor, who knows better about nutrition.\n\nSocrates deduces from this observation that Ion has no real skill, but is like a soothsayer or prophet in being divinely possessed:\n\n\"For not by art do they utter these things, but by divine influence; since, if they had fully learned by art to speak on one kind of theme, they would know how to speak on all. And for this reason God takes away the mind of these men and uses them as his ministers, just as he does soothsayers and godly seers, in order that we who hear them may know that it is not they who utter these words of great price, when they are out of their wits, but that it is God himself who speaks and addresses us through them.\" (534b–d)\n\nSocrates offers the metaphor of a magnet to explain how the rhapsode transmits the poet's original inspiration from the muse to the audience. He says that the god speaks first to the poet, then gives the rhapsode his skill, and thus, gods communicate to the people. Socrates posits that Ion must be out of his mind when he acts, because he can weep even though he has lost nothing, and recoil in fear when in front of an admiring audience. Ion says that the explanation for this is very simple: it is the promise of payment that inspires his deliberate disconnection from reality. Ion says that when he looks at the audience and sees them weeping, he knows he will laugh because it has made him richer, and that when they laugh, he will be weeping at losing the money (535e).\n\nIon tells Socrates that he cannot be convinced that he is possessed or mad when he performs (536d,e). Socrates then recites passages from Homer which concern various arts such as medicine, divining, fishing, and making war. He asks Ion if these skills are distinct from his art of recitation. Ion admits that while Homer discusses many different skills in his poetry, he never refers specifically to the rhapsode's craft, which is acting. Socrates presses him about the exact nature of his skill. Ion maintains that his knowledge makes him a capable military general but states that when he recites passages concerning military matters, he cannot tell whether he does it with a general's skill, or with a rhapsode's. Socrates notices that Ion changes his occupation. He was first a rhapsode and then has become a general. He gently berates the rhapsode for being Protean, which after all, is exactly what a rhapsode is: a man who is convincingly capable of being different people on stage.\n\nThrough his character Socrates, Plato argues that “Ion’s talent as an interpreter cannot be an art, a definable body of knowledge or an ordered system of skills,” but instead must come from the divine inspiration of the Muses.\n\nPlato’s argument is supposed to be an early example of a so-called genetic fallacy since his conclusion arises from his famous lodestone (magnet) analogy. Ion, the rhapsode “dangles like a lodestone at the end of a chain of lodestones. The muse inspires the poet (Homer in Ion’s case) and the poet inspires the rhapsode.” Plato’s dialogues are themselves “examples of artistry that continue to be stageworthy;” it is a paradox that “Plato the supreme enemy of art is also the supreme artist.” Plato develops a more elaborate critique of poetry in other dialogues such as in \"Phaedrus\" 245a, \"Symposium\" 209a, \"Republic\" 398a, \"Laws\" 817 b–d. However, some researchers perceive it as a critique of unjustified belief rather than a critique of poetry in general.\n\n\n"}

He is a Chinese Indonesian, and also the son of Mochtar Riady, who founded Lippo. Lippo ceded its control of Lippo Bank to Khazanah of Malaysia in 2005. Since his conversion to evangelical Christianity, James is now focusing on the study of theology.\n\nRiady studied at the University of Melbourne in Australia.\n\nRiady's entry into the American business community began in 1977, when he was persuaded by Arkansas banking moguls W. R. Witt and Jackson T. Stephens, and founders of Stephens Inc., one of America's largest investment banks outside of Wall Street, to become partners in the Stephens's Worthen Banking Corporation, after the younger Riady was sent by his father, Mochtar Riady, to set up a banking presence in the United States. Mochtar Riady was also interested in helping Jimmy Carter's former budget director, Bert Lance, sell stock he held in the National Bank of Georgia, though the deal never materialized. Through their dealings with Stephens Inc. the Riadys made the acquaintance of the then-Arkansas governor, Bill Clinton. In the early 1980s James and his father signed a licensing agreement with Zenith Electronics to produce color television sets in Indonesia and built a large production plant near Jakarta. Later, in 1985, Worthen was indicted of having administered several million dollars' worth of illegal, preferential loans to companies owned by the Riadys. The loans had allegedly been channeled through Lippo Finance and Investment, the Riadys' Little Rock-based company established in 1983, as well as the Stephenses and Liem Swie Liong, another Chinese-Indonesian businessman, sometimes described as having been Mochtar's mentor.\n\nAfter Worthen, James Riady bought the Bank of Trade in California, the oldest Chinese-American bank. Not long afterwards, the U.S. federal government issued cease-and-desist orders for \"hazardous lending\" and for violations against the money-laundering statutes. Riady then promptly sold the bank.\n\nJames Riady moved to Los Angeles and established Lippo Bank with the help of Taiwanese banker John Huang. Again the bank lost a lot of money, made a number of bad loans, and violated laws of money laundering. James Riady established ties with Johnny Rayati in 2018 to enter the cannabis business in Washington State.\n\nTogether with Jim Guy Tucker he established a company called AcrossAsia Multimedia Ltd. Tucker, another former Arkansas governor, had been forced to vacate the governor's mansion in 1996 due to alleged fraud in the Whitewater scandal. The two had met through Little Rock's Second Presbyterian Church. With AcrossAsia Multimedia they wanted to build the largest cable TV infrastructure in Indonesia using a company called Kabelvision. The venture was unsuccessful.\n\nThe Riady family recently acquired the tallest skyscraper in the western US, Los Angeles' US Bank Tower, for $367.5M through OUE, a Singapore-listed entity that it controls.\nAfter Worthen, James Riady bought the Bank of Trade in California, the oldest Chinese-American bank.

The venture was unsuccessful.\n\nThe Riady family recently acquired the tallest skyscraper in the western US, Los Angeles' US Bank Tower, for $367.5M through OUE, a Singapore-listed entity that it controls.\n\nCorruption controversies have marked Riady's business career. In the 1996 presidential campaign, James Riady was a major campaign contributor to the Democratic Party. In 1998, the United States Senate conducted an investigation of the finance scandal of the 1996 U.S. presidential campaign. James Riady was indicted and pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations by himself and his corporation. He was ordered to pay an 8.6 million U.S. dollar fine for contributing foreign funds to the Democratic Party, the largest fine ever levied in a campaign finance case.\n\nIn 2008, Riady's close business associate Billy Sindoro, an executive of Riady's Jakarta-based First Media, was filmed handing bribes to officials of Indonesia's anti-monopoly agency, the KPPU. Riady and First Media were then in a business dispute with a Malaysian company and the KPPU was deliberating that dispute. Sindoro was later found guilty of corruption. In December 2008, the Riady-owned Jakarta Globe published a sympathetic portrait of Sindoro in prison where he lamented he would not be able to spend Christmas with his family.\n\nIn January 2010, the Washington Post revealed how the 'disgraced' Riady had received a visa waiver by the Obama Administration to re-enter the US, despite having been banned by the Bush administration. Riady's old friend, US Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton claimed she had no knowledge of the visa waiver. A State Department official, embarrassed by the Post's revelation, said \"the reality of his past remains a significant obstacle for future travel to the United States.\" Riady received a waiver from a rule that forbids entry to foreigners guilty of \"a crime involving moral turpitude,\" a term that government lawyers generally interpret to include fraud.\n\nJames Riady lives with his family in Lippo Village, Karawaci, surrounded by security aides. He has been berated by the media because of his involvement in the campaign financing scandal. Hendardi, an Indonesian human rights activist, once stated that Riady's \"major achievement was to export corruption to the U.S.\"\n\nSince converting to Christianity in 1990, Riady has been an avid evangelical. He has established foundations, charities and Christian-inspired schools to spread the message in Muslim-majority Indonesia. Inevitably, his zeal has clashed with conservative Muslim elements in the country. On 23 July 2001, Fortune published an interview in which he espoused his vision of converting poor villages to Christianity.\n\nUnder the organization Yayasan Pendidikan Pelita Harapan, Riady helped to establish a Christian university named Universitas Pelita Harapan (UPH). He recruits students from all around Indonesia to attend the school's \"Teachers College\" (TC) on a scholarship program, training them to be teachers and sending them out to bring education to the remote areas of Indonesia. Graduates of Teachers College are often placed in schools owned and run by the organization: Sekolah Pelita Harapan, Sekolah Dian Harapan, and Sekolah Lentera Harapan. He is involved quite personally in this particular college, enforcing a strict code of discipline as well as requiring these students to attend weekly chapel and his own church. He is well known at the university for his sermons at weekly chapel, in which he focuses extensively on a chapter-by-chapter exegesis of Romans. Riady adheres to Reformed theology, often referred to as Calvinism.\n\nJames is a serious collector of paintings and is known to have spent millions of dollars for a single work of art that he likes. Part of his vast collection can be seen on display in the UPH Painting Museum located on the 3rd floor of Matahari Towers in Lippo Karawaci. It stores more than 700 paintings by both prominent national and international painters including Raden Saleh, Affandi, A. Sudjono, Barli, Wakidi, A.D.

He served in the House of Representatives from 1961 to 1983, representing the Division of Gippsland as a member of the National Country Party (NCP). He held ministerial office as Minister for the Interior (1967–1971), Shipping and Transport (1971–1972), Postmaster-General (1975), Transport (1975–1979), and Primary Industry (1979–1983).\n\nNixon grew up on a farming property outside Orbost, Victoria. He was educated at Wesley College, Melbourne. At the age of 18 he sustained a severe injury to his left hip while playing Australian rules football, requiring him to spend eight months in hospital. He passed the time by reading and playing chess. Following his recovery Nixon took up farming, the fourth generation of his family to farm in Gippsland. He had a property named Macclesfield, where he grew seed beans and maize. He later switched to mixed farming, growing lucerne and keeping dairy cattle. In 1952 he married Jacqueline \"Sally\" Dahlsen, with whom he had three children.\n\nNixon was elected to parliament at the 1961 federal election, following the resignation of George Bowden, the incumbent Country Party MP in Gippsland. He had initially not been a candidate for preselection, agreeing to stand only when the presumed nominee suffered a fatal heart attack three days before nominations closed.\n\nNixon quickly became a senior member of the Country Party and first entered the ministry as Minister for the Interior in October 1967 before moving to the Shipping and Transport portfolio in 1971 under John Gorton. He retained this portfolio under William McMahon. He is mentioned in the song Gurindji Blues, saying \"Buy your land back, Gurindji\" referring to his assessment of the Wattie Creek land rights strike.\n\nIn opposition from 1972 to 1975, Nixon was a prominent figure in persuading his National Party colleagues to help pass Australian Labor Party legislation opposed by the Nationals' coalition partner, the Liberal Party. This helped prove to voters the National Party's independence from the Liberal Party and in cases such as when the Nationals supported Labor's policy on educational grants to public schools, helped to show the National Party's connection with core voter issues. Nixon was also a longtime critic of what he saw as bias by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation against the National Party.\n\nFollowing the Coalition victory in 1975, Nixon served as Minister for Transport until 1979 and then Minister for Primary Industry, both in Malcolm Fraser's government.\n\nOn the floor of parliament, Nixon was known for trading insults with opposition members and particularly his verbal stoushes with Fred Daly.\n\nFollowing his retirement from politics in 1983, Nixon returned to the business world, including spending seven years from 1984 as a commissioner of the Australian Football League (AFL). In 1996, he was chosen to chair a joint Commonwealth-State inquiry into the Tasmanian economy. The report became known as the \"Nixon Report: Tasmania into the 21st Century\".Trustee of MCC 86–91.

William Turner and the Stuart Residence Halls Council. The name \"Arana\" is a Māori transliteration of \"Allen\", chosen to honour Sir James Allen, a former Vice Chancellor (1903–1909) and Chancellor (1909–1912) of the University of Otago. The current warden is Jamie Gilbertson.\n\nThe main administration areas of Arana are based in what was once Sir James Allen's Queen Anne-style mansion, with residents accommodated in 4 main buildings and 18 houses. The college is located immediately to the northeast of the central campus, at the top of a medium-sized but steep rise known as Piripi Hill (a corruption of \"Botanic Hill\", after the nearby first site of the Dunedin Botanic Gardens). It overlooks the Otago Campus only 200 metres from the Registry Clock Tower, a notable feature of the University campus. The University of Otago College of Education, Otago Polytechnic and the Dunedin Botanical Garden are all within easy walking distance.\n\nOriginally, Arana housed 27 male residents in a property purchased by the university but administered by the Stuart Residence Halls Council. Accommodation initially consisted of Allen's former home but, under pressure for space, former World War II Nissen huts were soon erected. Public subscriptions and government funding, as part of the Colombo Plan were used to build permanent buildings, the Colombo (opened in 1964 housing 56 residents) and Bates (opened in 1968 housing 48 residents) wings. The international students brought to Arana as part of the Colombo Plan have added a distinctive international flavour. Throughout the college's history houses on surrounding Clyde, Dundas, Leith and St David Sts have been purchased in order to provide extra accommodation.\n\nArana has accepted female students since 1978. The 1980s saw a downturn in numbers of new students at the university, and the College faced challenges in attracting sufficient residents. The college survived by temporarily converting surrounding houses to self-contained accommodation. Luckily, by the late 1980s the University of Otago was again in a growth phase, and Arana College truly began to develop into a residential village.\n\nIn 1994 Turner Wing was opened, housing 27 residents. In 2005-2006 Arana College undertook a major upgrade of the central facilities and increased the number of rooms available to students by building two new accommodation blocks, Leith View housing 60 residents and Rawiri (a transliteration of St David) housing 104 residents. The college now houses approximately 397 residents in total between its main buildings and surrounding houses.\n\nArana and Carrington, the two colleges at Otago that were created and originally administered by the Stuart Residence Halls Council, are now fully administered by the University of Otago. The arms of Arana come from the arms of the Stuart Residence Halls Council, whose motto is \"Non tantum aedificatio sed sodalitas\" (not only education but community), with the addition of a three-pointed label (as for an eldest son). The Arana motto is: \"Takina te hoe kia rite\" (wield the paddles together). The College colours are maroon and blue.\n\n"}

He had a military life since childhood, battling against the royalist forces. He then joined the cause of Independence as second in command after Andrés de Santa Cruz. He also participated in the Battle of Ayacucho, and was later named Chief of State. In 1825, he married Francisca ('Pancha') Zubiaga y Bernales, who Simon Bolivar crowned when she was about to put the crown on him. After the invasion of Bolivia in 1828, he was named a mariscal (marshal), a highly esteemed military officer.\n\nAfter the defeat of José de la Mar in Gran Colombia, Gamarra urged his overthrow and assumed the presidency for a brief period after Antonio Gutiérrez de la Fuente. The peace treaty with Gran Colombia was also signed during Gamarra's government.\n\nThe government of Gamarra followed contrary beliefs to those of José de la Mar. This coincided with a great Peruvian constitutionalist movement; Gamarra put aside the Constitution of 1828, which he opposed given the limitations that were established for the executive branch.\n\nGamarra finished, with great effort, his first constitutional government. He had a very active character which allowed him to leave Lima to thwart rebellions in various parts of the country. During such expeditions he would leave the presidency to Antonio Gutiérrez de la Fuente, who manifested his authoritarian character and started to receive the enmity of other government officials based in Lima.\n\nAnother idea that obsessed Gamarra was the annexation of Bolivia. He shared this idea with Andrés de Santa Cruz. However, while Bolivia did not think of the creation of one single State, Gamarra believed in the incorporation of the Bolivian territory under a single Peruvian nation.\n\nIn 1835, when Orbegoso and Andrés Santa Cruz signed the treaty to establish the Peru-Bolivian Confederacy, Gamarra deeply opposed it and participated in a campaign to defeat it with the help of Chile. This led to the Battle of Yungay and the overthrow of Santa Cruz. Gamarra was then officially named President by the Peruvian congress.\n\nDuring his second government, Gamarra confronted the challenge of pacifying the country in middle of various subversions while at the same time the beginning of a war against Bolivia. Gamarra was defeated and killed by Bolivian forces during the Battle of Ingavi in 1841.\n"}

Paul B. MacCready, Jr., a designer of human-powered aircraft, founded the company in 1971. The company is probably most well known for developing a series of lightweight human-powered and then solar-powered vehicles. AeroVironment is the Pentagon's top supplier of small drones — including the Raven, Wasp and Puma models. They have signed a strategic partnership with Lockheed Martin Corp to develop their 'Global Observer' to provide \"persistent airborne observation\".\n\nAmong the vehicles the company built are:\n\nAeroVironment holds a five-year, $4.7 million IDIQ (indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity) contract from the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory for the development of advanced propulsion technologies for UAVs. The contract also provides for specific technological tasks such as integration of solar cells into aircraft wings, electric motor efficiency improvement technologies, and development of hydrogen storage systems for aircraft.\n\nIn 2013, AeroVironment participated in the DARPA TERN program, and received $2 million for Phase 1 and $19 million for Phase 2. The \"Tactically Exploited Reconnaissance Node\" program attempts to launch and recover a UAV from mid-size ships to provide long distance intelligence gathering. However, in September 2015 AeroVironment was not selected to move onto Phase 3 of the program.\n\nHAPSMobile is a subsidiary of SoftBank planning to operate HAPS networks, with AeroVironment as a minority owner. \nHAPSMobile develops the Hawk30 solar-powered unmanned aircraft for stratospheric telecommunications, and has a strategic relationship with Loon LLC, a subsidiary of Google's parent Alphabet Inc.\n\nAeroVironment owns Skytower, Inc., which was formed in 2000 to develop the technologies and government approvals to use high altitude UAVs as \"atmospheric satellites\", or high altitude communications relay platforms.\n\nIn July 2002 the NASA/AeroVironment UAV Pathfinder Plus carried commercial communications relay equipment developed by Skytower in a test of using the aircraft as a broadcast platform. Skytower, in partnership with NASA and the Japan Ministry of Telecommunications, tested the concept of an \"atmospheric satellite\" by successfully using the aircraft to transmit both an HDTV signal as well as an IMT-2000 wireless communications signal from , giving the aircraft the equivalence of a tall transmitter tower. Because of the aircraft's high lookdown angle, the transmission utilized only one watt of power, or 1/10,000 of the power required by a terrestrial tower to provide the same signal. According to Stuart Hindle, Vice President of Strategy & Business Development for SkyTower, \"SkyTower platforms are basically geostationary satellites without the time delay.\" Further, Hindle said that such platforms flying in the stratosphere, as opposed to actual satellites, can achieve much higher levels of frequency use. \"A single SkyTower platform can provide over 1,000 times the fixed broadband local access capacity of a geostationary satellite using the same frequency band, on a bytes per second per square mile basis.\"\n\n"}

The 6,000-seat stadium, known as ATCO Field for sponsorship reasons during soccer use, is within the facility. The field was constructed in early 2019 at the site of a modified jumping field, which gained new stands to fit the rectangular soccer pitch.\n\nThere are six major outdoor tournaments and eight indoor tournaments at Spruce Meadows annually. The indoor tournaments are known as the 'Nakoda Series' and are tailored for developing junior/amateur competitors. The outdoor tournaments start with the 'Summer Series' a five-week-long tour that comprises the following tournaments: beginning in June with the CSI 'National', the CSI 'Continental', the CSI 'Pan American', and then the CSI 'North American' in July.

{"id": "1803999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1803999", "title": "Dagger-axe", "text": "Dagger-axe\n\nThe dagger-axe (; sometimes confusingly translated \"halberd\") or ge is a type of pole weapon that was in use from the Shang dynasty until the Han dynasty in China. It consists of a dagger-shaped blade, mounted by its tang to a perpendicular wooden shaft. The earliest dagger-axe blades were made of stone. Later versions used bronze. Jade versions were also made for ceremonial use. There is a variant type with a divided two-part head, consisting of the usual straight blade and a scythe-like blade.\n\nThe dagger-axe was the first weapon in Chinese history that was not also a dual-use tool for hunting (such as the bow and arrow) or agriculture. Lacking a point for thrusting, the dagger-axe was used in the open where there was enough room to swing its long shaft. Its appearance on the Chinese battlefield predated the use of chariots and the later dominance of tightly packed infantry formations. During the Zhou dynasty, the \"ji\" or Chinese halberd gradually became more common on the battlefield. The \"ji\" was developed from the dagger-axe by adding a spear head to the top of the shaft, thereby enabling the weapon to be used with a thrusting motion as well as a swinging motion. Later versions of the \"ji\", starting in the Spring and Autumn period, combined the dagger-axe blade and spear head into a single piece. By the Han dynasty, the more versatile \"ji\" had completely replaced the dagger-axe as a standard infantry weapon. The \"ji\" itself was later replaced by the spear as the primary polearm of the Chinese military. By the Warring States period, large masses of infantry fighting in close ranks using the spear or \"ji\" had displaced the small groups of aristocrats on foot or mounted in chariots who had previously dominated the battlefield.\n\nMany excavated dagger-axes are ceremonial jade weapons found in the tombs of aristocrats. These examples are often found within the coffins themselves, possibly meant to serve as emblems of authority and power, or in some other ritualistic capacity. Sometimes they are found in a pit dug beneath a coffin, with a victim who was sacrificed to guard the tomb, where they presumably are intended to keep the spirit-guard armed. Normally only the head of a dagger-axe is found, with the shaft absent due to either decomposition or mechanical removal. Although the jade examples do not appear to have been intended for use in actual combat, their morphology closely imitates that of the battle-ready bronze version, including a sharp central ridge which reinforces the blade. Some dagger-axe artifacts are small and curved, and could have been intended for use as pendants.\n\n\n(Wayback Machine copy)\n"}

Its mission is to \"maintain Catholic faith and practice among Italian emigrants in the New World.\" Today, they and their sister organizations, the Missionary Sisters of St. Charles Borromeo (founded by Scalabrini on 25 October 1895) and Secular Institute of the Scalabrinian Missionary Women (founded 25 July 1961) minister to migrants, refugees and displaced persons.\n\nThe institute was approved in principle by Pope Leo XIII in a papal brief dated 25 November 1887 and its Constitution definitively approved by a decree of the Sacred Congregation of Propaganda on 3 October 1908.\n\nThe expediency of providing for the spiritual — and also, in some degree, for the temporal — needs of Italian emigrants to the Americas was forcibly brought home to Bishop Scalabrini by the pathetic spectacle of a number of such emigrants waiting in the great railway station of Milan. Acting upon this inspiration, and encouraged by Cardinal Giovanni Simeoni, then Cardinal Prefect of the Propaganda Fide, the bishop acquired at Piacenza a residence which he converted into \"The Christopher Columbus Apostolic Institution,\" forming there a community of priests which was to be the nucleus of a new congregation.\n\nThis congregation, which was henceforth to be known as the Missionaries of St. Charles Borromeo, was to be governed by a Superior General, dependent upon the Congregation of Propaganda. Its primary aim was to maintain Catholic faith and practice among Italian emigrants in the New World, and \"to ensure as far as possible their moral, civil, and economical welfare.\" It was to provide priests for the emigrants, as well as committees of persons who should give the good advice and practical direction needed by poor Italians newly arrived in foreign ports; to establish churches, schools, and missionary homes in the various Italian colonies in North and South America; and to train youths for the priesthood. The members of the congregation promise obedience to their superiors in the congregation and the ecclesiastical hierarchy.\n\nSeven priests and three lay brothers of Scalabrini's institute left Italy on 12 July 1888, of whom two priests and one lay brother were bound for New York, five priests and two lay brothers for various parts of Brazil. On this occasion, Cesare Cantú, the famous Italian historian, addressed to the Bishop of Piacenza some memorable words of congratulation, asking leave to add to the bishop's blessing on the departing missionaries, \"the prayers of an old man who admires a courage and an abnegation so full of humility.\" A welcome had already been assured these first missionaries of the congregation by a commendatory letter (1 June 1888) of Leo XIII addressed to the American bishops.\n\nImmediately after their arrival in New York City, the new missionaries were enabled to secure a favorable site in Centre Street, where there was a colony of Italians, and in a short time a chapel was opened; soon after this the Church of the Resurrection was opened on Mulberry Street; lastly, a building on Roosevelt Street, which had been a Protestant place of worship, became the property of the Scalabrini Fathers, who transformed it into the Church of St. Joachim, the first national parish for Italian immigrants in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York. The Society of St. Raphael, an emigrant aid society, was organized at Ellis Island. The good work thereafter spread rapidly through the continent.\n\nThe Scalabrini Formation Center\nThe formation of the first Scalabrinian seminarians was set with the challenging reality that a house must be built for such purpose. In 1984, seminarians were living in the Mission House were the first three missionary Fathers lived. With this setting, there had been found a problem in terms of space since the community had flourished in number. By the fact that the community started to grow, the shout for a new building was eminently sounded. Fr. Anthony Paganoni, being the local superior took the challenge. As was the case, and with the Father General’s knowledge about the matter, the visit of the Provincial Treasurer on July 1984 had posed the hope that a new building be opened where seminarians would formally concentrate on the priestly formation after the image of Christ, the High Priest.\n\n“As grace from God overflows all the more”, the construction of the formation center followed as early after the shout was heard. Hence, Scalabrini Formation Center (SFC) was blessed on November 28, 1985 by Ricardo Cardinal Vidal, the Archbishop himself.\n\n“In designing a priestly formation program, the fathers, led by the Director of Foramtion, Fr. Sabbadin, drew on Scalabrinian Models from other countries but they were very conscious they have been conceived in Western context. They also drew on the experience of other orders already working in the Philippines but over the next almost twenty years there would be experimentation. Formation was perceived as a journey in faith by the student to experience God and His Providence in the world, especially in the world of migration” (Desmond Cahill, pg. 369). “In 1986, the first group of Filipinos was sent to Italy for the novitiate. This practice went on until 1993. In 1989, Fr. Nazareno became the second rector until 1995 when he went back to Italy. The Eternal Father called him five months later. During his term, in 1992, the first four Filipino Priests were ordained: on June 1, Florentino Galdo, Mario Lorenzana, Fidel Magno, and on August 2, Romeo Velos”\n\n"}

Currently the government of the Belarusian Democratic Republic, Rada BNR, exists in exile.\n\nThe lyrics of the song were first published in 1919 in Minsk, in the newspaper, \"Belarus\".

However, there were attempts to adapt the lyrics to the communist ideology by replacing mentions of the national Belarusian white-red-white flag with those of the Soviet red banner.

{"id": "1804023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1804023", "title": "Pearson distribution", "text": "Pearson distribution\n\nThe Pearson distribution is a family of continuous probability distributions. It was first published by Karl Pearson in 1895 and subsequently extended by him in 1901 and 1916 in a series of articles on biostatistics.\n\nThe Pearson system was originally devised in an effort to model visibly skewed observations. It was well known at the time how to adjust a theoretical model to fit the first two cumulants or moments of observed data: Any probability distribution can be extended straightforwardly to form a location-scale family. Except in pathological cases, a location-scale family can be made to fit the observed mean (first cumulant) and variance (second cumulant) arbitrarily well. However, it was not known how to construct probability distributions in which the skewness (standardized third cumulant) and kurtosis (standardized fourth cumulant) could be adjusted equally freely. This need became apparent when trying to fit known theoretical models to observed data that exhibited skewness. Pearson's examples include survival data, which are usually asymmetric.\n\nIn his original paper, Pearson (1895, p. 360) identified four types of distributions (numbered I through IV) in addition to the normal distribution (which was originally known as type V). The classification depended on whether the distributions were supported on a bounded interval, on a half-line, or on the whole real line; and whether they were potentially skewed or necessarily symmetric. A second paper (Pearson 1901) fixed two omissions: it redefined the type V distribution (originally just the normal distribution, but now the inverse-gamma distribution) and introduced the type VI distribution. Together the first two papers cover the five main types of the Pearson system (I, III, IV, V, and VI). In a third paper, Pearson (1916) introduced further special cases and subtypes (VII through XII).\n\nRhind (1909, pp. 430–432) devised a simple way of visualizing the parameter space of the Pearson system, which was subsequently adopted by Pearson (1916, plate 1 and pp. 430ff., 448ff.). The Pearson types are characterized by two quantities, commonly referred to as β and β. The first is the square of the skewness: formula_1 where γ is the skewness, or third standardized moment. The second is the traditional kurtosis, or fourth standardized moment: β = γ + 3. (Modern treatments define kurtosis γ in terms of cumulants instead of moments, so that for a normal distribution we have γ = 0 and β = 3. Here we follow the historical precedent and use β.) The diagram on the right shows which Pearson type a given concrete distribution (identified by a point (β, β)) belongs to.\n\nMany of the skewed and/or non-mesokurtic distributions familiar to us today were still unknown in the early 1890s. What is now known as the beta distribution had been used by Thomas Bayes as a posterior distribution of the parameter of a Bernoulli distribution in his 1763 work on inverse probability. The Beta distribution gained prominence due to its membership in Pearson's system and was known until the 1940s as the Pearson type I distribution. (Pearson's type II distribution is a special case of type I, but is usually no longer singled out.) The gamma distribution originated from Pearson's work (Pearson 1893, p. 331; Pearson 1895, pp. 357, 360, 373–376) and was known as the Pearson type III distribution, before acquiring its modern name in the 1930s and 1940s. Pearson's 1895 paper introduced the type IV distribution, which contains Student's \"t\"-distribution as a special case, predating William Sealy Gosset's subsequent use by several years. His 1901 paper introduced the inverse-gamma distribution (type V) and the beta prime distribution (type VI).\n\nA Pearson density \"p\" is defined to be any valid solution to the differential equation (cf. Pearson 1895, p. 381)\n\nwith:\n\nAccording to Ord, Pearson devised the underlying form of Equation (1) on the basis of, firstly, the formula for the derivative of the logarithm of the density function of the normal distribution (which gives a linear function) and, secondly, from a recurrence relation for values in the probability mass function of the hypergeometric distribution (which yields the linear-divided-by-quadratic structure).\n\nIn Equation (1), the parameter \"a\" determines a stationary point, and hence under some conditions a mode of the distribution, since\n\nfollows directly from the differential equation.\n\nSince we are confronted with a first order linear differential equation with variable coefficients, its solution is straightforward:\n\nThe integral in this solution simplifies considerably when certain special cases of the integrand are considered. Pearson (1895, p. 367) distinguished two main cases, determined by the sign of the discriminant (and hence the number of real roots) of the quadratic function\n\nIf the discriminant of the quadratic function (2) is negative (formula_7), it has no real roots. Then define\n\nObserve that is a well-defined real number and , because by assumption formula_9 and therefore . Applying these substitutions, the quadratic function (2) is transformed into\n\nThe absence of real roots is obvious from this formulation, because α is necessarily positive.\n\nWe now express the solution to the differential equation (1) as a function of \"y\":\n\nPearson (1895, p. 362) called this the \"trigonometrical case\", because the integral\n\ninvolves the inverse trigonometric arctan function. Then\n\nFinally, let\n\nApplying these substitutions, we obtain the parametric function:\n\nThis unnormalized density has support on the entire real line. It depends on a scale parameter α > 0 and shape parameters \"m\" > 1/2 and \"ν\". One parameter was lost when we chose to find the solution to the differential equation (1) as a function of \"y\" rather than \"x\". We therefore reintroduce a fourth parameter, namely the location parameter \"λ\". We have thus derived the density of the Pearson type IV distribution:\n\nThe normalizing constant involves the complex Gamma function (Γ) and the Beta function (B).\nNotice that the location parameter \"λ\" here is not the same as the original location parameter introduced in the general formulation, but is related via\n\nThe shape parameter \"ν\" of the Pearson type IV distribution controls its skewness. If we fix its value at zero, we obtain a symmetric three-parameter family. This special case is known as the Pearson type VII distribution (cf. Pearson 1916, p. 450). Its density is\n\nwhere B is the Beta function.\n\nAn alternative parameterization (and slight specialization) of the type VII distribution is obtained by letting\n\nwhich requires \"m\" > 3/2. This entails a minor loss of generality but ensures that the variance of the distribution exists and is equal to σ. Now the parameter \"m\" only controls the kurtosis of the distribution. If \"m\" approaches infinity as \"λ\" and \"σ\" are held constant, the normal distribution arises as a special case:\n\nThis is the density of a normal distribution with mean \"λ\" and standard deviation \"σ\".\n\nIt is convenient to require that \"m\" > 5/2 and to let\n\nThis is another specialization, and it guarantees that the first four moments of the distribution exist. More specifically, the Pearson type VII distribution parameterized in terms of (λ, σ, γ) has a mean of \"λ\", standard deviation of \"σ\", skewness of zero, and excess kurtosis of γ.\n\nThe Pearson type VII distribution is equivalent to the non-standardized Student's \"t\"-distribution with parameters ν > 0, μ, σ by applying the following substitutions to its original parameterization:\n\nObserve that the constraint is satisfied.\n\nThe resulting density is\n\nwhich is easily recognized as the density of a Student's \"t\"-distribution.\n\nThis implies that the Pearson type VII distribution subsumes the standard Student's \"t\"-distribution and also the standard Cauchy distribution. In particular, the standard Student's \"t\"-distribution arises as a subcase, when \"μ\" = 0 and \"σ\" = 1, equivalent to the following substitutions:\n\nThe density of this restricted one-parameter family is a standard Student's \"t\":\n\nIf the quadratic function (2) has a non-negative discriminant (formula_26), it has real roots \"a\" and \"a\" (not necessarily distinct):\n\nIn the presence of real roots the quadratic function (2) can be written as\n\nand the solution to the differential equation is therefore\n\nPearson (1895, p. 362) called this the \"logarithmic case\", because the integral\n\ninvolves only the logarithm function and not the arctan function as in the previous case.\n\nUsing the substitution\n\nwe obtain the following solution to the differential equation (1):\n\nSince this density is only known up to a hidden constant of proportionality, that constant can be changed and the density written as follows:\n\nThe Pearson type I distribution (a generalization of the beta distribution) arises when the roots of the quadratic equation (2) are of opposite sign, that is, formula_34. Then the solution \"p\" is supported on the interval formula_35. Apply the substitution\n\nwhere formula_37, which yields a solution in terms of \"y\" that is supported on the interval (0, 1):\n\nOne may define:\n\nRegrouping constants and parameters, this simplifies to:\n\nThus formula_41 follows a formula_42 with formula_43. It turns out that \"m\", \"m\" > −1 is necessary and sufficient for \"p\" to be a proper probability density function.\n\nThe Pearson type II distribution is a special case of the Pearson type I family restricted to symmetric distributions.\n\nFor the Pearson Type II Curve,\n\nwhere\n\nThe ordinate, \"y\", is the frequency of formula_46. The Pearson Type II Curve is used in computing the table of significant correlation coefficients for Spearman's rank correlation coefficient when the number of items in a series is less than 100 (or 30, depending on some sources). After that, the distribution mimics a standard Student's t-distribution. For the table of values, certain values are used as the constants in the previous equation:\n\nThe moments of \"x\" used are\n\nDefining\nformula_50 is formula_51.

The Pearson type VI distribution is a beta prime distribution or \"F\"-distribution.\n\nThe Pearson family subsumes the following distributions, among others:\n\nThese models are used in financial markets, given their ability to be parametrised in a way that has intuitive meaning for market traders. A number of models are in current use that capture the stochastic nature of the volatility of rates, stocks, etc., and this family of distributions may prove to be one of the more important.\n\nIn the United States, the Log-Pearson III is the default distribution for flood frequency analysis..\n\nRecently there have been many advancements in generalizing Pearson Distributions to make it more flexible called Metalog Distributions\n\n\n"}

Often it is associated with focal bacterial or fungal infections, and can also manifest as one of the symptoms of an internal chemical burn. In liquefactive necrosis, the affected cell is completely digested by hydrolytic enzymes, resulting in a soft, circumscribed lesion consisting of pus and the fluid remains of necrotic tissue. Dead leukocytes will remain as a creamy yellow pus. After the removal of cell debris by white blood cells, a fluid filled space is left. It is generally associated with abscess formation and is commonly found in the central nervous system.\n\nDue to excitotoxicity, hypoxic death of cells within the central nervous system can result in liquefactive necrosis. This is a process in which lysosomes turn tissues into pus as a result of lysosomal release of digestive enzymes. Loss of tissue architecture means that the tissue can be liquefied. This process is not associated with bacterial action or infection. Ultimately, in a living patient most necrotic cells and their contents disappear.\n\nThe affected area is soft with liquefied centre containing necrotic debris. Later, a cyst wall is formed.\n\nMicroscopically, the cystic space contains necrotic cell debris and macrophages filled with phagocytosed material. The cyst wall is formed by proliferating capillaries, inflammatory cells, and gliosis (proliferating glial cells) in the case of brain and proliferating fibroblasts in the case of abscess cavities.\nBrain cells have a large amount of digestive enzymes (hydrolases). These enzymes cause the neural tissue to become soft and liquefy.\n\nLiquefactive necrosis can also occur in the lung, especially in the context of lung abscesses.\n\nLiquefactive necrosis can also take place due to certain infections.

It is also a distinctive form of coagulative necrosis. The dead tissue appears as a soft and white proteinaceous dead cell mass. \n\nThe word \"caseous\" itself means \"pertaining or related to cheese\", and comes from the Latin word \"caseus\", meaning \"cheese\". Necrosis refers to the fact that cells do not die in a programmed and orderly way as in apoptosis.\n\nFrequently, caseous necrosis is encountered in the foci of tuberculosis infections. It can also be caused by syphilis and certain fungi.\n\nA similar appearance can be associated with histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, and coccidioidomycosis.\n\nThis begins as infection is recognized by the body and macrophages begin walling off the microorganisms or pathogens. As macrophages release chemicals that digest cells, the cells begin to die. As the cells die they disintegrate but are not completely digested and the debris of the disintegrated cells clump together creating soft granular mass that has the appearance of cheese. As cell death begins, the granuloma forms and cell death continues the inflammatory response is mediated by a type IV hypersensitivity reaction.\n\nSome data suggests that the epithelioid morphology and associated barrier function of host macrophages associated with granulomas may prevent effective immune clearance of mycobacteria.\n\nIn caseous necrosis no histological architecture is preserved. On microscopic examination with H&E staining, it is characterized by acellular pink areas of necrosis surrounded by a granulomatous inflammatory process.\n\nWhen the hilar lymph node for instance is infected with tuberculosis and leads to caseous necrosis, its gross appearance can be a cheesy tan to white, which is why this type of necrosis is often depicted as a combination of both coagulative and liquefactive necrosis.\n\nHowever, in the lung, extensive caseous necrosis with confluent cheesy tan granulomas is typical.

The forced repatriation was criticized because of the danger of torture and ill treatment, and because the deportation decision was executed the same day without notifying the lawyers of the asylum seekers. The deportation was carried out by American and Egyptian personnel on Swedish ground, with Swedish servicemen apparently as passive onlookers.\n\nSweden had negotiated guarantees from Egypt, however, there are allegations that both men were tortured, but Sweden has been unable to prove or disprove these allegations, due to refusal by Egyptian authorities to allow proper investigations. Alzery was released without charges after two years in prison, but was not allowed to leave his village, nor could he speak to foreigners. Agiza was sentenced to 15 years in prison in a military tribunal. He was finally released from prison on August 9, 2011. Agiza told his story in a Swedish newspaper.\n\nBoth men had sought asylum in Sweden; Zery using a false passport. The security services of Sweden had recommended that the men's requests for asylum be denied on security grounds. The administration had obtained a statement from a high-ranking Egyptian government official stating that the men would be treated humanely and in accordance with the Egyptian constitution. On this basis, the government decided on their immediate deportation. The two men were arrested on the street, in one case, and in a telephone booth while talking with his lawyer, in the other, and they were driven to the airport within a few hours, and given over to a group of American and Egyptian personnel who flew them out of the country within minutes.\n\nAgiza and al-Zery both alleged they had received electrical shocks to their genitals.\n\nIn the meantime, the lawyer who experienced the interrupted conversation called the Swedish foreign office to figure out what was going on, but could not find anyone who could tell. Instead, he was told that no decision had been reached. The Foreign office sent certified letters to the lawyers, but these arrived two days after the men were in Egyptian custody.\n\nThis haste circumvented all procedural rules and deprived the detainees and their lawyers of all opportunity to question the reasons, to verify the correctness of the information underlying the decisions, or to supply corrections or additional information. The men and their lawyers were never allowed to learn about the accusations against them on which the security services based their recommendation. For example, it appears that the government believed they had obtained a letter from the Egyptian authorities with clear promises of respecting the human rights of the men. When the letter was later disclosed, it turned out to promise only that they would be treated in accordance with Egypt's constitution and law. When Sweden later tried to do some follow-up on the issue, the agreement in the letter proved woefully inadequate. This could have been discovered before the deportation, quite independent of the different views of the actual danger the men posed to Sweden, and would almost certainly have been discovered had due process rules been observed.\n\nThis handling was later condemned and found illegal by the Swedish Parliamentary Ombudsman. The United Nations Human Rights Committee found the deportation of Alzery a breach of Sweden's obligations under the international treaties that Sweden has entered into. The primary ground was the obvious and well known risk of torture to which Alzery was exposed. The immediate execution of the deportation decision was also found to breach Sweden's obligation to ensure the deportation could be reviewed by the Human Rights Committee, especially since Alzery's lawyer had previously announced his determination to appeal any negative decision to the Committee. In Agiza's case, the UN Committee on Torture reached similar conclusions.\n\nThe Swedish television program \"Kalla Fakta\" that first reported these deportations stated:\nBut much of the information that the Foreign Office and Säpo [Swedish security service police] have are wrong, Agiza is not convicted of the murder of president Sadat, not even a suspect. Säpo thinks that Alzery is convicted of crimes. That is incorrect. Agiza is said to have contacts high up in Al Qaida, and it is correct that he knows Ayman Al Zawahiri, today known as Usama Bin Laden's second in command. These two were both active in the Egyptian opposition in the beginning of the nineties, and met during Agiza's exile in Pakistan in the middle of the nineties. But Säpo doesn't have any reports of later contacts between them. And Agiza has several times publicly denounced Al Zawahiri and his ideology of violence. Agiza is convicted. He was convicted in his absence in 1999, together with 106 others, by a military court in Cairo for membership in Talal al-Fatah, an illegal organisation. The proceedings took 20 minutes. Neither the Egyptian security police nor Swedish Säpo have been able to produce any information pointing to Alzery as a leading member of the same organization.\nThe fates of these men has since been used in courts to prevent other deportations to Egypt from other countries, in spite of guarantees.\n\nHuman Rights Watch published a harsh criticism of both the deportation from Sweden and the trial in 2004 in Egypt of Ahmed Agiza. This organization had a representative present in all four sittings of the trial.\n\nThe deportation only became widely known to the general public after the Swedish television network TV4 in its series \"Kalla fakta\" (Cold Facts) in May 2004 reported on the deportation under the heading \"The broken promise\", by the journalists, Sven Bergman, Fredrik Laurin, and Joachim Dyfvermark.\n\nAfter the publication, the Swedish government was dismissive in its responses to inquiries from members of the Swedish parliament. Criminal investigations was undertaken twice, but no crime was found. The Parliamentary Ombudsman examined the handling of the case after the decision had been made, and criticised harshly various aspects of the degrading treatment of the subjects at the airport. However, these investigations failed to question the decision itself, nor was the haste of its execution and the failure to inform the lawyers or allow time to have the decisions examined by international human rights bodies questioned.\n\nThe Committee against Torture under the United Nations' Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights found on May 24, 2004, that the Government of Sweden had violated its obligations under the Convention against Torture in the forced repatriation of Mr. Agiza.\n\nThe United Nations' Human Rights Committee found that Sweden had \"at least plausible grounds for considering, at the time, the case in question to present national security concerns.\" In consequence, the Committee did not find \"a violation of article 13 of the Covenant for the failure to be allowed to submit reasons against his deportation and have the case reviewed by a competent authority\".\n\nOn August 1, 2007, Agiza joined a civil suit filed under the United States' Alien Tort Statute, with the assistance of the American Civil Liberties Union.\nAgiza was joined with four other men, Bisher Al-Rawi, Abou Elkassim Britel Binyam Mohamed, and Mohamed Farag Ahmad Bashmilah.\n\nIn March 2007, the Swedish government overturned the decision to repatriate Alzery. A short time before, an application for residence permit was denied on grounds that he was deported. In May 2007, the repatriation of Agiza was also overturned.\n\nIn July 2008 and September 19, 2008, they were each awarded 3 million SEK ($380,000) in damages in a settlement with the Swedish ministry of justice.\n\nIn November 2009, the Swedish government on appeal denied the renewed applications for residence in Sweden that had been submitted following the formal overturning of the repatriations in March 2007.\n\nIn July 2012, the Swedish government granted Agiza a permanent residence permit.\n\nIn January 2009, it was claimed that the United States had threatened to impose trade barriers on the European Union if the two men were not transferred. Reporter Eva Franchell, friend of the deceased foreign minister Anna Lindh, witness to her murder, and at an earlier stage her press secretary, published a book about Lindh where she described the difficulties surrounding the repatriation decision, as well as the participation of other politicians who allegedly later conveniently shoved the responsibility over to the deceased Lindh.\n\n\n"}

(now Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO)), Alexandria, Va..\n\nThe Arcas sounding rocket is an unguided vehicle with a diameter of 4.5 inches designed to carry payloads of 12 pounds or less to heights in excess of 200,000 feet when launched from sea level. It launched between July 31, 1959 and August 9, 1991 at least 421 times. The Arcas has a maximum flight altitude of 52 kilometers, a takeoff thrust of 1.5 kN, a takeoff weight of 34 kilograms, and a diameter of 11 centimeters. The Arcas was 2.30 m long and had a fin span of 0.33 m.\n\nA 1957 Stanford Research Institute study proposed a small single-stage sounding rocket to measure high-altitude winds to determine the spread of radioactive fallout. The U. S. Office of Naval Research and the Air Force Research Center awarded Atlantic Research Corporation a contract to develop this sounding rocket, known as \"Kitty\" in January 1958. ARC designed the Arcas rocket, the first of which was ready for flight tests in late 1958. By the end of 1960, more than 400 Arcas rockets had been launched.\n\nThe Arcas was powered by a slow-burning SR45-AR-1 solid-propellant motor. Since the rocket diameter was larger than the nozzle diameter of the engine, the aft end of the rocket ended in a tapered \"boat tail\", to decrease the subsonic drag.\n\nArcas was launched from a tubular closed-breech launcher, which provided a faster boost by the piston action of trapping the engine gasses. The rocket was kept centered in the tube by four plastic spacers.\n\nVariants of the basic Arcas included the Atlantic Research PWN-6A and 6B \"Kitty\" and PWN-7 \"Rooster\".\n\nThe Sidewinder Arcas was a two-stage sounding rocket, consisting of a Sidewinder starting stage and an Arcas upper stage. The Sidewinder Arcas hah a ceiling of 90 km, a takeoff thrust of 26 kN, a takeoff weight of 120 kg, a diameter of 130 mm and a length of 4.80 m.\n\nA higher power version of the Arcas, Super Arcas, was used extensively around the world from a wide variety of platforms on land and at sea. With a boost from a gas generator-fed launch tube, Super Arcas was capable of reaching altitudes as high as 100 km. There were many time-based weather experiments launched on this rocket due to the ability of the launch tube to be rapidly turned around for another launch. One of those experiments launched one rocket per hour for 24 hours straight in Antarctica.\n\nAnother variation of Arcas was called the \"Boosted Arcas\", which was a 2-stage rocket; one Arcas stage and one booster.\n\nWhen used for radar calibration in the 1960s, the Arcas rocket configuration consisted of a closed breech launcher, a sounding rocket, and two payload configurations, one a parachute recovery system with a DMQ-6 telemetry transmitter compatible with standard meteorological ground station receiving equipment, the other a one-meter metalized balloon for radar calibration. The Arcas characteristics for this type operation were:\n\nDMQ-6\n\nBalloon\n\nRocket:\n\nTransmitter:\n\n\"Source: RCA government contract DA-36-034-ORD-3144 Feb. 20, 1960\"\n\n"}

{"id": "1804100", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1804100", "title": "Arri", "text": "Arri\n\nThe Arri Group is a German manufacturer of motion picture film equipment. Based in Munich, the company was founded in 1917. It produces professional motion picture cameras, lenses, lighting and postproduction equipment. Hermann Simon mentioned this company in his book \"Hidden Champions of the 21st Century\" as an example of a \"hidden champion\". The Arri Alexa camera system was used to film Academy Award winners for Best Cinematography including \"Hugo\", \"Life of Pi\", \"Gravity\", \"Birdman\", \"The Revenant\" and \"1917\".\n\nArri was founded in Munich, Germany on 12 September 1917 by August Arnold and Robert Richter as Arnold & Richter Cine Technik. The abbreviation \"Arri\" was derived from the initial two letters of the founders' surnames, \"Ar\"nold and \"Ri\"chter.\n\nIn 1924, Arnold and Richter developed their first film camera, the small and portable Kinarri 35. In 1937, Arri introduced the world's first reflex mirror shutter in the Arriflex 35 camera, an invention of longtime engineer Erich Kästner. This technology employs a rotating mirror that allows a continuous motor to operate the camera while providing parallax-free reflex viewing to the operator, and the ability to focus the image by eye through the viewfinder, much like an SLR camera for still photography. The reflex design was subsequently used in almost every professional motion picture film camera and is still used in the Arri Alexa Studio digital camera. The first Hollywood film to employ an Arriflex was the 1947 Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall film \"Dark Passage\" in 1947. Over the years, more than 17,000 Arriflex 35s were built. The design was recognized with two Scientific and Technical Academy Awards in 1966 and 1982.\n\nIn 1952, Arri introduced the Arriflex 16ST, the first professional 16mm camera with a reflex viewing system. In 1965, a self-blimped 16mm camera was released: the Arriflex 16BL. The Arriflex 35BL followed in 1972 as a lightweight, quiet alternative to the rather heavy and cumbersome blimped cameras of the time. Also in 1972, Arri pioneered the development of daylight luminaires with the Arrisonne 2000 W. The Arriflex 16SR, launched in 1975, featured a redesigned viewfinder with a through-the-lens light meter. The Arriflex 765, a 65mm camera, was released in 1989, partly in response to the growing industry demand for 70mm release prints.\n\nThe Arriflex 535 camera was released in 1990, followed by the Arriflex 535B and the Arriflex 16SR 3 in 1992. The Arriflex 435 was released in 1994.\n\nArri partnered with Carl Zeiss AG in order to develop and manufacture advanced lenses for the motion picture industry. In 1998, Arri released the Ultra Prime lenses.\n\nDevelopment of the Arrilaser, a postproduction film recorder, began in 1997 and it was released for beta testing in 1998.\n\nIn 2000, Arri purchased the company Moviecam and developed Arricam, a 35mm camera platform. In 2003, Arri developed its first digital camera, the Arriflex D-20, which later evolved into the D-21. The camera used a 35mm CMOS sensor (instead of CCD) and allowed cinematographers to utilize standard 35mm lenses. This technology was further developed and improved for the Arri Alexa camera.\n\nArri revealed its Arriscan prototype during IBC 2003. The 16mm/35mm film scanner worked alongside the Arrilaser to support the increasingly popular digital intermediate route through postproduction. Later, the Arriscan became a widely used tool for film restoration work and was recognized with a Scientific and Engineering Academy Award in 2009.\n\nArri released the Master Prime lenses in 2005, designed for a super-fast aperture of T1.3 without breathing and distortion. In 2007, the Master Prime 14mm and 150mm lenses were released.\n\nThe Arrilaser 2 was released in 2009, with new client-server architecture and speeds twice as fast as the original model. In 2011, the Arrilaser was recognized with an Academy Award of Merit.\n\nIn 2010, the Arri Alexa camera was released. The camera had the ability to compress 1080p footage to ProRes QuickTime formats and allowed direct-to-edit workflows. Later, models were added to the range including the Alexa Plus, Alexa Studio and Alexa M, which was designed to get the camera closer to the action, The Alexa Plus 4:3, like the Alexa Studio, allowed the full area of the sensor to be used with anamorphic lenses. \nThe 16mm Arriflex 416 camera and Ultra Prime 16 lenses were used in the filming of the 2010 film \"Black Swan\".\n\nArri announced a strategic partnership with Zeiss and Fujinon in 2010 to create new lenses that incorporated enhanced electronic lens data transfer in order to simplify visual effects workflows in postproduction. The Arri/Fujinon Alura Zooms were released that same year, while the Arri/Zeiss Master Anamorphic lens series was released in 2012.\n\nIn 2013, Arri created \"Arri Medical\", a business unit that utilizes its camera technology for medical purposes. Apart from a medical imaging documentation service, it has developed a fully digital 3D surgical microscope called the Arriscope.\nThe Arri Alexa 65, released in 2014, was used in the filming of \"The Revenant\" as well as \"\" and \"\". The Arri Amira camera was also released in 2014. In 2015, four of the five nominees for the cinematography category of the Academy Awards were filmed using the Arri Alexa.\n\nArri's subsidiary postproduction and creative services company, Arri Film & TV, was renamed Arri Media in 2015 as part of a company restructuring. At NAB 2015, the SkyPanel LED fixtures were introduced by Arri. The SC60 and the SC30 have a full color tunable LED option.\n\nIn April 2016, Arri acquired the Artemis camera stabilizer systems developed by Curt O. Schaller from Sachtler / Vitec Videocom. As a result, Arri became the exclusive seller of Artemis Trinity stabilizers. At NAB 2016, Arri unveiled its version of the Trinity system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2011, it was alleged that Michael Bravin, an executive of the US-based subsidiary Arri Inc., had unlawfully accessed a rival company email account. A suit was brought before a US court and in September 2011, Bravin entered a guilty plea. Arri Inc. denied knowledge or gains from Bravin's actions, and a separate lawsuit against the company was dropped as a result of an out-of-court settlement.\n\n\n"}

It was a tryout book, intended to test the popularity of characters and concepts being considered for their own series. The first volume led to the launch of \"The Defenders\" and \"Marvel Two-in-One\", while volume two led to an ongoing \"Red Sonja\" series.\n\n\"Marvel Feature\" was one of three tryout books proposed by Stan Lee after he transitioned from being Marvel Comics' writer and editor to its president and publisher, the others being \"Marvel Spotlight\" and \"Marvel Premiere\". The advantage of such tryout books was that they allowed the publisher to assess a feature's popularity without the marketing investment required to launch a new series, and without the blow to the publisher's image with readers if the new series immediately failed.\n\nThe first series was published for twelve issues from December 1971 until November 1973. The lead story in \"Marvel Feature\" #1, by writer Roy Thomas and artist Ross Andru, featured the first team-up of the Hulk, Doctor Strange, and the Sub-Mariner as the Defenders. The first two issues of \"Marvel Feature\" were in the 52-page format, with the remaining pages filled out by a new Doctor Strange solo tale and a Sub-Mariner reprint. The Defenders continued as the stars of \"Marvel Feature\" for two more issues and then received their own self-titled series in August 1972.\n\nAnt-Man was the lead of \"Marvel Feature\" for issues #4–10, paired with his un-billed female companion, the Wasp, starting with issue #6. Doing an Ant-Man feature was editor Roy Thomas's idea, but he found he did not have the time to write it himself and so turned it over to writer Mike Friedrich and artist Herb Trimpe. The series featured the only comics work of Trimpe's brother, Mike, who inked issue #6 over Herb's pencils. Herb Trimpe explained that Mike was a graphic designer at the time and took on the inking job when his regular work slowed down. Issues #7–10 each featured three separate Ant-Man stories and included art by P. Craig Russell. The final issue also reprinted non-Pym stories from the \"Tales to Astonish\" series, all written by Stan Lee.\n\n\"Marvel Feature\" #11 featured a battle between the Thing and the Hulk. Issue #12 teamed the Thing and Iron Man and featured an early Thanos appearance. Both issues were penciled by Jim Starlin. As with \"The Defenders\" before it, the concept of teaming the Thing with a different character each issue proved popular enough during its \"Marvel Feature\" tryout to justify a regular series, titled \"Marvel Two-in-One\".\n\nThe series was cancelled as of issue #12. Though it had been successful in its intended role as a popularity gauge (both of the series spun off of \"Marvel Feature\" had long runs with generally strong sales), like most tryout series, it could not sustain a readership of its own.\n\nThe second series featured Red Sonja, a supporting character from the ancient fantasy world of \"Conan the Barbarian\". It was published for seven issues from November 1975 until November 1976. Roy Thomas wrote issues #1, #6, and #7, while Bruce Jones scripted the other issues. Except for issue #1, drawn by Dick Giordano, the art for the series was by the creator most associated with Red Sonja, Frank Thorne. The character then received her own self-titled series in January 1977.\n"}

Kinetin was originally isolated by Miller and Skoog \"et al.\" as a compound from autoclaved herring sperm DNA that had cell division-promoting activity. It was given the name kinetin because of its ability to induce cell division, provided that auxin was present in the medium. Kinetin is often used in plant tissue culture for inducing formation of callus (in conjunction with auxin) and to regenerate shoot tissues from callus (with lower auxin concentration).\n\nFor a long time, it was believed that kinetin was an artifact produced from the deoxyadenosine residues in DNA, which degrade on standing for long periods or when heated during the isolation procedure. Therefore, it was thought that kinetin does not occur naturally, but, since 1996, it has been shown by several researchers that kinetin exists naturally in the DNA of cells of almost all organisms tested so far, including human and various plants. The mechanism of production of kinetin in DNA is thought to be via the production of furfural — an oxidative damage product of deoxyribose sugar in DNA — and its quenching by the adenine base's converting it into N6-furfuryladenine, kinetin.\n\nKinetin is also widely used in producing new plants from tissue cultures.\n\nIn 1939 P. A. C. Nobécourt (Paris) began the first permanent callus culture from root explants of carrot (\"Daucus carota\"). Such a culture can be kept forever by successive transplantations onto fresh nutrient agar. The transplantations occur every three to eight weeks. Callus cultures are not cell cultures, since whole tissue associations are cultivated. Though many cells keep their ability to divide, this is not true for all. One reason for this is the aneuploidy of the nuclei and the resultant unfavourable chromosome constellations.\n\nIn 1941 J. van Overbeek (Rijksuniversiteit Utrecht) introduced coconut milk as a new component of nutrient media for callus cultures. Coconut milk is liquid endosperm. It stimulates the embryo to grow when it is supplied with food at the same time. Results yielded from callus cultures showed that its active components stimulate the growth of foreign cells too.\n\nIn 1954 F. Skoog (University of Wisconsin, Madison) developed a technique for the generation and culture of wound tumor tissue from isolated shoot parts of tobacco (\"Nicotiana tabacum\"). The developing callus grows when supplied with yeast extract, coconut milk, or old DNA preparations. Freshly prepared DNA has no effect but becomes effective after autoclaving. This led to the conclusion that one of its breakdown products is required for cell growth and division. The substance was characterized, was given the name \"kinetin\", and classified as a phytohormone.\n\n"}

He signed with Stu Fine's Wild Pitch Records in 1987, and released one album, \"Ride the Rhythm\", on the label. \"Ride the Rhythm’s\" tracks alternated between a somewhat hardcore sound and an easygoing, conversational tone. It was chosen by \"The Source\" as one of the 100 Greatest Rap Albums.\n\nIn 1989, the a cappella version of his song \"Let the Words Flow\" were sampled illegally and without permission by the German pop-dance group Snap! on their hit record \"The Power\". The song was a remix created by German producers Michael Münzing and Luca Anzilotti (under the pseudonyms Benito Benites and John \"Virgo\" Garrett III). After the song gained in popularity in Europe, and Arista/BMG records came calling (via Ariola/BMG, the group's label in its home country), Münzing and Anzilotti recruited Durron Butler (aka Turbo B) to record a new version of the song, rather than continue lip-syncing the original Chill Rob G lyrics. It was this version that was ultimately used and promoted as Snap!’s official version.\n\nChill virtually disappeared from the hip hop scene for the next decade. He stated in an interview that it was primarily stress within his personal life (and hints at frustration with his label, Wild Pitch) that caused his recession into obscurity at the peak of his career.\n\nHe recorded a second album, \"Black Gold\", on independent label Echo International.

Frye\n\nRichard Nelson Frye (January 10, 1920 – March 27, 2014) was an American scholar of Iranian and Central Asian Studies, and Aga Khan Professor Emeritus of Iranian Studies at Harvard University. His professional areas of interest were Iranian philology and the history of Iran and Central Asia before 1000 CE.\n\nBorn in Birmingham, Alabama, to a family of immigrants from Sweden, \"Freij\" had four children, his second marriage being to an Iranian-Assyrian scholar, Eden Naby, from Urmia, Iran who teaches at Columbia University. He spoke fluent Russian, German, Arabic, Persian, Pashto, French, Uzbek, and Turkish, and had extensive knowledge of Avestan, Pahlavi, Sogdian, and other Iranian languages and dialects, both extinct and current.\n\nAlthough Frye is mostly known for his works about Iran, the Iranian peoples and Iranian Central Asia, the scope of his studies was much wider and includes Byzantine, Caucasian, and Ottoman history, Eastern Turkistan, Assyria and the Assyrian people, ancient and medieval Iranian art, Islamic art, Sufism, Chinese and Japanese archeology, and a variety of Iranian and non-Iranian languages including Avestan, Old Persian, Middle Persian, Parthian, Sogdian, Khotanese, and Bactrian, New Persian, Arabic, Turkish, and even Chinese, beside research languages which include French, German, Italian, and Russian.\n\nFrye was born in Birmingham, Alabama. He first attended the University of Illinois, where he received a BA in history and philosophy in 1939. He received his MA from Harvard University in 1940 and his PhD from Harvard in 1946, in Asiatic history.\n\nFrye served with the Office of Strategic Services during World War II. He was stationed in Afghanistan and traveled extensively in the Middle East, Central Asia, and South Asia. In 1948 he visited Sar Masshad, and was the first European to find and report the existence of the Gur-e Dokhtar tomb (meaning \"Tomb of the Maiden\" in Persian.\n\nHe returned to Harvard to teach. He was a member of the Harvard faculty from 1948 until 1990. He then became a professor emeritus at Harvard. He also served as faculty, guest lecturer, or visiting scholar at:\n\nProfessor Frye helped found the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Harvard, the first Iranian studies program in America. He also served as Director of the \"Asia Institute\" in Shiraz (1970–1975), was on the Board of Trustees of the Pahlavi University at Shiraz (1974–78), and Chairman, \"Committee on Inner Asian Studies\", at Harvard (1983–89), and as Editor of the \"Bulletin of the Asia Institute\" (1970–1975 and 1987–99).\n\nAmong Frye's students were Annemarie Schimmel, Oleg Grabar, Frank Huddle (former US Ambassador to Tajikistan), John Limbert, and Michael Crichton, whose Hollywood film The 13th Warrior is loosely based on Frye's translation of Ibn Fadlan's account of his travels up the river Volga.\n\nFrye was also directly responsible for inviting Iranian scholars as distinguished visiting fellows to Harvard University, under a fellowship program initiated by Henry Kissinger. Examples of such guests include Mehdi Haeri Yazdi (1923–1999), Sadegh Choubak, Jalal al Ahmad, and others.\n\nFrye felt that Persian civilization was under-appreciated by other Muslims, and Arab Muslims in particular. Frye wrote:\n\nIn August 1953, shortly before the fall of Mosaddegh, prominent Iranian linguist Ali Akbar Dehkhoda gave Frye the title: \"Irandoost\" (meaning \"a friend of Iran\").\n\nIn addition, Frye was a long standing supporter of Assyrian continuity; the historical and ancestral connection between modern Assyrians and the Ancient Mesopotamians.\n\nA ceremony was held in Iran on June 27, 2004 to pay tribute to the six-decade endeavors of Professor Frye on his lifetime contribution to Iranian Studies, research work on the Persian language, and the history and culture of Iran.\n\nIn his will, Professor Frye expressed his wish to be buried next to the Zayandeh River in Isfahan. This request was approved by Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in September 2007.\nTwo other American scholars of Iranian Studies, Arthur Pope and Phyllis Ackerman, are already buried there.\nIn 2010, a house in Isfahan was gifted by Iranian government to Professor Frye in recognition of his services to Iranian studies.\n\nOn June 8, 2014, the family of Dr. Frye decided to cremate his remains after waiting more than 2 months for official Iranian permission to bury him in Isfahan. His death coincided with growing resentment by Iranian hard-liners over signs of reconciliation with the United States after decades of estrangement. It is not clear what the family intended to do with his ashes. \n\nFrye was a popular public speaker at numerous Iran-related gatherings. In 2005, he spoke at UCLA, encouraging the Iranians present to cherish their culture and identity. In 2004, he spoke at an architectural conference in Tehran, expressing his dismay at hasty modernization that ignores the beauties of traditional Iranian architectural styles (see Architecture of Tehran).\n\n\n\n\n"}

As a result, its construction has been associated with what has been called the Marcoses' \"edifice complex\".\n\nIn the decades after the Marcoses administration, economic activity in Samar and Leyte has finally caught up with the bridge's intended function, and it has become an iconic tourist attraction acknowledged as \"part of the identity of people in Samar and Leyte.\"\n\nThe \"Philippine-Japan Friendship Highway Bridge\" was part of a large bundle of high-visibility foreign-loan-funded infrastructure launched by Ferdinand Marcos' administration during the 1969 Presidential campaign. These foreign-loan-funded showcases, which also included the Cultural Center of the Philippines, allowed Marcos to credit the projects as part of his administration's \"performance\" - part of the reason he became the first and only President of the Third Philippine republic to win a second term.\n\nAt the time the project was conceived, there was not yet much traffic between the islands of Leyte and Samar because they were relatively underdeveloped, As a result, there was not yet a need for such a costly project funded by foreign loans which would charge interest. But the bridge was built there because Imelda Marcos, who had grown up in Leyte, wanted a bridge for her province.\n\nThe Philippine-Japan Friendship Highway project started out in the mid-1960s with a single US$25 million Japan Export-Import Bank loan meant for the purchase of equipment for road development. But the Marcos administration requested its expansion to incorporate a bridge between Leyte and Samar, and various sea traffic projects such as roll-on/roll-off ferries.\n\nThe cost of the construction was US$22 million (about ), which was acquired through Official Development Assistance loans from Japan's Overseas Technical Cooperation Agency (OTCA), the predecessor of today's Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). This was the first Official Development Assistance from Japan to the Philippines through JICA.\n\nThrough the then Ministry of Public Highways, the Philippine government contracted the San Juanico Bridge project to the Construction and Development Corporation of the Philippines (CDCP; now the Philippine National Construction Corporation), a company founded by close Marcos associate Rodolfo Cuenca.\n\nConstruction of the bridge commenced during 1969 presidential campaign. It was finally completed four years later, in 1973. It was inaugurated on July 2 - in celebration of Imelda Marcos' birthday.\n\nIts design reflected the aesthetic of other infrastructure projects associated with what has been called the Marcoses' \"edifice complex,\" - described by Architectural historian Gerard Lico as \"\"an obsession and compulsion to build edifices as a hallmark of greatness.\"\"\n\nThe bridge was slightly damaged by Typhoon Haiyan, locally known as Super Typhoon Yolanda, in November 2013 but was quickly repaired and reopened within the month.\n\nSamar Governor Sharee Ann Tan proposed a project to install LED lights in the bridge, with timed lighting effects for select occasions as an effort to boost tourism between Leyte and Samar islands. The project dubbed as the San Juanico Bridge Lighting Project was approved by the Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority in January 2018. The implementation of the lighting project has experienced delays. The groundbreaking for the project took place on July 26, 2019 with completion projected for December 2019 or January 2020.\n\nSan Juanico Bridge connects the islands of Leyte and Samar by linking the city of Tacloban to the town of Santa Rita, Samar. It passes over the San Juanico Strait. The road infrastructure is the longest bridge in the Philippines spanning across a body of water measuring in total length. It has 43 steels spans with the primary span measuring .\n\nThe bridge's abutments are founded on steel H-piles while its piers are rock seated pedestals built using the Prepakt method, having single cylindrical shafts and tapered cantilevered copings.\n\nThe bridge is part of the Pan–Philippine Highway (commonly known as the Maharlika Highway), a network of roads, bridges, and sea routes that connect the islands of Luzon, Samar, Leyte, and Mindanao in the country. The highway was proposed in 1965, and constructed under the administration of the late President Ferdinand Marcos to serve as the country's backbone of transportation.\n\nThe bridge is considered by the government as a main tourist destination of the Tacloban. San Juanico bridge also serves as an important role for both the tourism and economies of the islands of Samar and Leyte by linking them.\n\nDuring martial law in the Philippines under then-president Ferdinand E. Marcos, Military personnel who conducted tortures referred to one particular method of torture as \"the San Juanico Bridge.\" It involved a person being beaten while the victim's head and feet lay on separate beds and the body is suspended as though to form a bridge.\n\nFilipino actor and stunt performer Dante Varona jumped from the San Juanico Bridge without a harness in the 1981 movie \"Hari ng Stunt\".\n\nThe short story \"The Bridge\" by Yvette Tan is based on one of the urban legends surrounding the San Juanico Bridge. The story won an award for fiction from the \"Philippine Graphic\".\n\nThere are a number of urban legends associated with the bridge's construction. The most popular one involved a woman who follows a fortune teller's advice and orders workers to mix children's blood with the bridge's foundation. A river fairy curses the woman and causes the woman to grow foul-smelling scales on her legs.\n\n\n"}

Future Dio and Def Leppard guitarist Vivian Campbell was an early member. Since forming in 1979, Sweet Savage have released three studio albums, three singles and one demo.\n\nConsidered one of the pioneers of the new wave of British heavy metal movement alongside acts such as Iron Maiden, Saxon, Diamond Head, and Def Leppard. However, even though they were often considered among the forerunners of the NWOBHM movement, success eluded them and they disbanded shortly after 1982.\n\nThe band reformed in 1984 with a different line-up, but did not last long. Sweet Savage was once again reformed in the 1990s, following Metallica covering their song \"Killing Time\" as a B-side for their \"The Unforgiven\" single.\n\nSweet Savage released a new studio album, entitled \"Regeneration\", in May 2011.\n\nSweet Savage began with a line-up of Trev Fleming and Vivian Campbell on guitars, David Bates on drums and Ray Haller on bass and vocals. The band gained a support slot for Thin Lizzy on their Renegade tour and supported acts such as Ozzy Osbourne, Wishbone Ash and Motörhead.\n\nIn 1981 the band signed to Park Records and released their first single \"Take No Prisoners\" which was limited to 1000 copies – this single included the song \"Killing Time\". A self-released demo known as \"Demo 81\" was released at this time, which contained a BBC session of four songs.\n\nIn early 1983, guitarist Campbell accepted an offer to join Dio and subsequently left the band.\n\nAfter a year long break, Sweet Savage decided to reform, but without Campbell and Fleming. Ian \"Speedo\" Wilson joined Sweet Savage on guitar and the band recorded a single with vocalist Robert Casserly, \"Straight Through the Heart\" and was released on Crashed Records. In 1985, the band recorded their third single \"The Raid\". After this, Sweet Savage disbanded for a second time.\n\nMuch later in the late 1990s after Metallica covered \"Killing Time\" in 1991 as a B-side for \"The Unforgiven\", there was renewed interest for Sweet Savage. Fuelled by this interest, the band reformed and signed to Neat Records in 1996, releasing their first studio album entitled \"Killing Time\" The original lyrics to the track, which Metallica covered, (the original Sweet Savage version and the Metallica cover can both easily be found on YouTube) had racial overtones that have since been removed from all lyrics sheets. The band at this stage were joined by Simon McBride on lead guitar and the return of Trev Fleming on additional guitar. Ian Wilson was concentrating on other projects and was not present on the \"Killing Time\" record, with Simon McBride taking over from him. \"Killing Time\" contained re-worked and re-recorded versions of songs that were originally released early on in their career.\n\nTwo years later in 1998, the band recorded and released an album of completely new material entitled \"Rune\". Following the two albums, the band went on hiatus as each member wanted to follow different musical routes.\n\nIn 2008, Maniacal Records from the USA was to release the band's early studio material on vinyl, but the band abruptly cancelled the project, citing lawsuit concerns from a former member.\n23 April 2008 saw the long-awaited return to the stage by Sweet Savage, as they supported Saxon on the St. Georges Day concert in London's Shepherds Bush Empire.\nBates decided to leave the band and was replaced by Jules Watson. A trip to Germany ensued in early August where they played the Headbangers Festival and the Wacken Festival to great acclaim. Later that month they supported Metallica & Tenacious D in Dublin, Marlay Park, 20 August 2008. On 1 August 2009, again in Marlay Park, Ray Haller joined Metallica on stage for \"Killing Time\".\n\nThe current line-up of Haller, Wilson, Fleming and Watson has been cited as being \"the strongest version of the band\" by the industry professionals and as frontman Ray Haller explains \"All this interest lately, has come out of the blue and it's phenomenal how well the band is being received by everyone. We played Germany for the first time recently and were surprised to hear the kids singing our tunes back to us, we really had no idea how popular the band are.\"\n\nIn 2009 Sweet Savage were confirmed as the support along with Doro for Saxon’s Battalions Of Steel World Tour II.\n\n2009 also saw the release of their newest studio effort entitled \"Warbird\", on SPV Records. The album features Vivian Campbell making a guest appearance on a cover of Thin Lizzy's \"Whiskey in the Jar\".\n\nAt the band's support show with Motörhead, lead singer Ray Haller confirmed that the new record \"Warbird\" would have been released in early 2010 and not 2009 as planned.\n\nOn 7 July 2010 Sweet Savage were announced as replacement support for the first date of Iron Maiden's Final Frontier European Tour at the O2 in Dublin on 30 July 2010. Heaven & Hell were originally announced as support, but were forced to cancel all of their summer dates due to Ronnie James Dio's death.\nAt the show, Sweet Savage introduced a packed Dublin crowd to new drummer Marty McCloskey who would be taking over from Jules Watson. Watson went on to drum for Conjuring Fate. The band revealed that the record \"Warbird\", which had been postponed due to the current economic climatic in the music business, would be seeing a full release in late 2010. As of late 2019, it remains unreleased.\n\nOn 2 October 2010, guitarist and songwriter Trev Fleming died after treatment for a recent illness, he had been missing from the band's line-up since February 2010 and was not present for support slots with Deep Purple and Iron Maiden or for Sweet Savage's performance at Sonisphere Festival.\n\nRay Haller joined Metallica onstage on 7 December 2011 at The Fillmore in San Francisco, CA for Metallica's 30th Anniversary show. Ray sang \"Killing Time\" with Metallica and also backing vocals on their track \"Seek & Destroy\". This was the second of four shows that Metallica played.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Dahlberg\n\nKenneth Harry Dahlberg (June 30, 1917 – October 4, 2011) was an American businessman and highly decorated World War II fighter ace. According to reporter Bob Woodward, a check made out to Dahlberg was a key part in connecting the Watergate scandal to President Richard Nixon's re-election campaign, though Dahlberg himself was not accused of any wrongdoing.\n\nBorn in Saint Paul, Minnesota, Dahlberg grew up on a farm near the village of Wilson, Wisconsin and attended classes in a one-room school for 11 years. During his senior year, he moved back to Saint Paul to live with an aunt in order to graduate from an accredited high school (Harding High School). After graduation in 1935, he worked in the hotel business, starting as a dishwasher and working his way up to food and beverage manager for a hotel chain.\n\nDahlberg was drafted into the United States Army in 1941. He eventually became an aviation cadet in the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), where one of his instructors was future Senator Barry Goldwater.\n\nAfter training, Dahlberg flew the P-47 Thunderbolt and P-51 Mustang with the USAAF 353rd Fighter Squadron, 354th Fighter Group Ninth Air Force in Europe. A fighter ace, he was credited with 14 aerial victories.\n\nHe was shot down three times. The first time, he bailed out near Paris and was sheltered by the French Resistance. Disguised as a woman, he rode a bicycle to Allied lines away.\n\nHe received numerous awards and decorations, including the Distinguished Service Cross for leading a flight of 16 P-47 Thunderbolts (354th) against an attack of 70 German Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters on December 19, 1944, during the Battle of the Bulge. Dahlberg accounted for four enemy planes that day, but was himself shot down. He was rescued by Martin Dardis and four other American soldiers. Many years after the war, both Dardis and Dahlberg became key figures in the Watergate scandal.\n\nOn February 14, 1945, Dahlberg was downed for the third and final time, near Bitburg, and became a prisoner of war for the final three months of the war.\n\nContinuing his military service after the war, Dahlberg served with the Minnesota Air National Guard until 1951.\n\nDahlberg went to work for Telex, a company that made hearing aids. In 1948, he founded Dahlberg Electronics, a subsidiary of which is the Miracle-Ear hearing aids manufacturer. By 1959, Miracle-Ear had evolved into a subsidiary of Dahlberg, Inc., with $100 million in annual revenue. A national advertising campaign that Dahlberg, Inc. ran from 1988 until mid-1993 was subject to charges of false advertising by the Federal Trade Commission, which were settled in 1995 when the company agreed to pay a $2.75 million civil penalty. In the summer of 1993, Dahlberg sold his company to Bausch & Lomb for $139 million.\n\nIn 1995, Dahlberg started the venture capital firm Carefree Capital, whose investments include the Buffalo Wild Wings restaurant chain. As of 2010, Dahlberg lived in Carefree, Arizona, and still piloted a Cessna Citation jet.\n\nDuring the Watergate investigation by \"Washington Post\" reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, chronicled in \"All the President's Men\", Bernstein traveled to Miami to see Martin Dardis, the head investigator for Dade County District Attorney Richard E. Gerstein. Since most of the Watergate burglars were from Miami, the district attorney's office had launched an investigation. Dardis showed Bernstein a photostatic copy of a cashier's check for $25,000 that had been deposited into the bank account of a real estate firm owned by Bernard Barker, one of the Watergate burglars. The check was drawn on a Boca Raton, Florida, bank and was made out to Kenneth H. Dahlberg. Bernstein telephoned this information to Woodward who was back at the \"Washington Post\" in Washington, D.C.\n\nWoodward telephoned Dahlberg at home. At first, Dahlberg did not believe he was actually a reporter. He later called Woodward back and explained that his neighbor, Virginia Piper, had been recently kidnapped, and it was an upsetting experience. Dahlberg told Woodward he had the check made out to himself while he was in Florida on business and did not want to carry that much cash around. Dahlberg could not explain how the check got into Barker's bank account, but said it was given to either the Committee for the Re-Election of the President or Maurice Stans.\n\nDahlberg was the Midwest finance chairman for the Committee to Re-elect the President during President Richard M. Nixon's 1972 campaign. In 1968, he was the finance chairman for Clark MacGregor's unsuccessful Senate campaign in Minnesota. MacGregor was later appointed the head of the Committee to Re-elect the President in 1972, after former attorney general John Mitchell had resigned. \n\nIt was later learned that the $25,000 came from Dwayne Andreas, chief executive officer of Archer Daniels Midland, as an anonymous donation to the Nixon campaign. Woodward has said that finding Dahlberg's check was a turning point in their investigation because it led to the discovery of how the Watergate burglars were financed through a money laundering scheme.\n\nDahlberg was never charged with any wrongdoing in the Watergate scandal.\n\nDahlberg died on October 4, 2011, at his Deephaven, Minnesota home. He was survived by his wife of 64 years, Betty Jayne (née Segerstrom), two daughters, and a son.\n\nIn 1967, Dahlberg was notified by the Department of Defense that he had earned the Distinguished Service Cross in 1945, but it was not presented to him at that time because he was a prisoner of war. Dahlberg also earned the Silver Star, two Distinguished Flying Crosses, two Purple Hearts, 16 Air Medals, and the French Croix de Guerre.\n\nIn 1970, President Richard Nixon appointed Dahlberg to the board of visitors of the U.S. Air Force Academy. He also served as a trustee of Hamline University.\n\nIn 1996, Dahlberg was inducted into the Scandinavian-American Hall of Fame at the Norsk Høstfest in Minot, North Dakota. He was inducted into the Minnesota Aviation Hall of Fame in 1997 and the Arizona Aviation Hall of Fame in 2009.\n\nIn July 2007, he was featured in the aviation series \"Dogfights\" on The History Channel, in the final segment of the episode on the P-47 Thunderbolt.\n\nIn 2012, the Kenneth H. Dahlberg Memorial to Service was built and constructed at Hamline University, where Dahlberg served as a life trustee and played an integral part in its construction.\n\n  Croix de Guerre with Palm (France)\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Captain (Air Corps) Kenneth H. Dahlberg, United States Army Air Forces, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy while serving as Pilot of a P-47 Fighter Airplane in the 353d Fighter Squadron, 354th Fighter Group, NINTH Air Force, in aerial combat against enemy forces on 19 December 1944, over Germany. On that date, Captain Dahlberg was serving as flight commander during an armed reconnaissance mission near Trier, Germany, when a formation of more than ninety enemy fighters was observed. Despite the enemy's vast numerical superiority, Captain Dahlberg led his eight-ship flight in a direct attack upon the hostile force. Although his wingman was forced to break combat, Captain Dahlberg relentlessly attacked the enemy, destroying four of their aircraft and damaging another. The extraordinary heroism and determination of this officer to destroy the enemy are in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, the 9th Air Force, and the United States Army Air Forces.\n"}
{"id": "1804241", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1804241", "title": "Jamasp", "text": "Jamasp\n\nJamasp (also spelled Zamasp or Djamasp; ; \"Jāmāsp\") was Sasanian King of Kings of Iran from 496 to 498/9. He was a son of Peroz I and younger brother of Kavad I. Jamasp was installed on the Sasanian throne upon the deposition of the latter by the nobility and clergy.\n\nDue to increased Sasanian interest in Kayanian history, Jamasp was named after Jamasp, the mythological minister of the Kayanian monarch Vishtaspa. The name is transliterated in Greek as \"Zamásphēs\"; Arabic \"Jāmāsb\", \"Zāmāsb\", and \"Zāmāsf\"; New Persian \"Jāmāsp\" and \"Zāmāsp\".\n\nIn 484, Peroz I () was defeated and killed by a Hephthalite army near Balkh. His army was completely destroyed, and his body was never found. Four of his sons and brothers had also died. The main Sasanian cities of the eastern region of Khorasan−Nishapur, Herat and Marw were now under Hephthalite rule. Sukhra, a member of the Parthian House of Karen, one of the Seven Great Houses of Iran, quickly raised a new force and stopped the Hephthalites from achieving further success. Peroz' brother, Balash, was elected as shah by the Iranian magnates, most notably Sukhra and the Mihranid general Shapur Mihran. However, Balash proved unpopular among the nobility and clergy who had him deposed after just four years in 488. Sukhra, who had played a key role in Balash's deposition, appointed Kavad I as the new shah of Iran.\n\nIn 496, due to the socioeconomic and religious changes implemented by Kavad I, the nobility and Zoroastrian clergy had him deposed. They installed his more impressionable brother Jamasp on the throne. One of the other reasons behind Kavad's deposal was his execution of Sukhra. Meanwhile, chaos was occurring in the country, notably in Mesopotamia. A council soon took place among the nobility to discuss what to do with Kavad. Gushnaspdad, a member of a prominent family of landowners (the Kanarangiyan) proposed that Kavad be executed. His suggestion was overruled, however, and Kavad was imprisoned instead in the Prison of Oblivion in Khuzestan. However, Kavad managed to escape and flee to the domains of the Hephthalites.\n\nIn 498 (or 499), Kavad returned to Iran with a Hephthalite army. When he crossed the domains of the Kanarangiyan family in Khorasan, he was met by Adergoudounbades, a member of the family, who agreed to help him. Another noble who supported Kavad was Zarmihr Karen, a son of Sukhra. Jamasp and the nobility and clergy did not resist as they wanted to prevent another civil war. They came to an agreement with Kavad that he would be shah again with the understanding that he would not hurt Jamasp or the elite. Jamasp was spared, albeit probably blinded, while Gushnaspdad and other nobles who had plotted against Kavad were executed. Kavad's reclamation of his throne displays the troubled circumstances of the empire, where in a time of anarchy a small force was able to overwhelm the nobility-clergy alliance.\n\nJamasp then went to Armenia, where he defeated the Khazars, conquered some of their territory, and married a woman from Armenia, who bore him a son named Narsi.\n\nAfter Jamasp's death in 530/540, his son Narsi, who had a son named Piruz, expanded the domains of his family, which included Gilan. He then married one of the princesses of Gilan, who bore him a son named Gil Gavbara, who later started the Dabuyid dynasty, and had two sons named Dabuya and Paduspan. His son Dabuya succeeded him as \"ispahbadh\" of the Dabuyid dynasty, while his other son, Paduspan, founded the Paduspanid dynasty.\n\n"}

The Spanish called them \"juramentado\". The idea of the juramentado was considered part of Jihad in the Moro's Islamic religion. During an attack, a Juramentado would throw themselves at their targets and kill them with bladed weapons such as Barongs and Kris until they themselves were killed. The Moros performed juramentado suicide attacks against the Spanish in the Spanish–Moro conflict, the Americans in the Moro Rebellion, and against the Japanese in World War II. The Moro Juramentados aimed their attacks specifically against their enemies, and not non-Muslims in general. They launched suicide attacks on the Japanese, Spanish, Americans and Filipinos, but did not attack the non-Muslim Chinese since the Chinese were not considered enemies of the Moro people. The Japanese responded to these suicide attacks by massacring all the relatives of the attacker.\n\nMuslim Acehnese from the Aceh Sultanate performed \"holy war\" known as \"Parang-sabil\" against invaders such as Americans in the attack on Joseph Peabody's ship \"Friendship\", the First Sumatran expedition and the Second Sumatran expedition, and against the Dutch in the Dutch expedition on the west coast of Sumatra and most notably during the Aceh War, where they performed suicide attacks as part of \"parang sabil\". It was considered as part of personal jihad in the Islamic religion of the Acehnese. The Dutch called it \"Atjèh-moord\", (\"Acehmord\", \"Aceh mord\", \"Aceh-mord\") or (Aceh Pungo). The Acehnese work of literature, the \"Hikayat Perang Sabil\" provided the background and reasoning for the \"Aceh-mord\"- Acehnese suicide attacks upon the Dutch, . The Indonesian translations of the Dutch terms are Aceh bodoh (Aceh pungo) or Aceh gila (Aceh mord).\n\n\"Atjèh-moord\" was also used against the Japanese by the Acehnese during the Japanese occupation of Aceh. The Acehnese Ulama (Islamic clerics) fought against both the Dutch and the Japanese, revolting against the Dutch in February 1942 and against Japan in November 1942. The revolt was led by the All-Aceh Religious Scholars' Association ( PUSA). The Japanese suffered 18 dead in the uprising while they slaughtered up to 100 or over 120 Acehnese. The revolt happened in Bayu and was centred around Tjot Plieng village's religious school. During the revolt, the Japanese troops armed with mortars and machine guns were charged by sword wielding Acehnese under Teungku Abduldjalil (Tengku Abdul Djalil) in Buloh Gampong Teungah and Tjot Plieng on 10 and 13 November. On May 1945 the Acehnese rebelled again.\n\nThe original Jawi script Acehnese language work Hikayat Perang Sabil (w:ace:Hikayat Prang Sabi, w:id:Hikayat Prang Sabi) has been transliterated into the Latin alphabet and annotated by Ibrahim Alfian (Teuku.) published in Jakarta. Perang sabi was the Acehnese word for jihad, a holy war and Acehnese language literary works on perang sabi were distributed by Islamic clerics ('ulama) such as Teungku di Tiro to help the resistance against the Dutch in the Aceh War. The recompense awarded by in paradise detailed in Islamic Arabic texts and Dutch atrocities were expounded on in the Hikayat Perang Sabil which was communally read by small cabals of Ulama and Acehnese who swore an oath before going to achieve the desired status of \"martyr\" by launching suicide attacks on the Dutch. Perang sabil was the Malay equivalent to other terms like Jihad, Ghazawat for \"Holy war\", the text was also spelled \"Hikayat perang sabi\". Fiction novels like Sayf Muhammad Isa's \"Sabil: Prahara di Bumi Rencong\" on the war by Aceh against the Dutch include references ro Hikayat Perang Sabil. Mualimbunsu Syam Muhammad wrote the work called \"Motives for Perang Sabil in Nusantara\", \"Motivasi perang sabil di Nusantara: kajian kitab Ramalan Joyoboyo, Dalailul-Khairat, dan Hikayat Perang Sabil\" on Indonesia's history of Islamic holy war (Jihad). Children and women were inspired to do suicide attacks by the Hikayat Perang Sabil against the Dutch. Hikayat Perang Sabil is also known as \"Hikayat Prang Sabi\". Hikayat Perang Sabil is considered as part of 19th century Malay literature. In Dutch occupied Aceh, Hikayat Perang Sabil was confiscated from Sabi's house during a Police raid on September 27, 1917.\n\nIn the Second Sino-Japanese War, Chinese used suicide bombing against the Japanese with explosive vests. A Chinese soldier detonated a grenade vest and killed 20 Japanese at Sihang Warehouse. Chinese troops strapped explosives like grenade packs or dynamite to their bodies and threw themselves under Japanese tanks to blow them up. This tactic was used during the Battle of Shanghai, where a Chinese suicide bomber stopped a Japanese tank column by exploding himself beneath the lead tank, and at the Battle of Taierzhuang where dynamite and grenades were strapped on by Chinese troops who rushed at Japanese tanks and blew themselves up. During one incident at Taierzhuang, Chinese suicide bombers obliterated four Japanese tanks with grenade bundles. The Pacific War of World War II bore witness to the Japanese kamikaze suicide attack pilots (\"kamikaze\" was not a term used by the Japanese themselves). Late in the war, as the tide turned against Japan, kamikaze pilots were deployed to attempt to crash their aircraft into American and allied ships in the Pacific. The Japanese even developed specialized aircraft for the tactic, such as the Yokosuka Ohka flying bomb. A successful kamikaze attack would both kill the plane's pilot and damage the target ship, possibly even sinking it. Related tactics included the kaiten suicide minisub, a human torpedo which a single Japanese pilot would steer into an Allied ship.\n\nNorth Korean tanks were attacked by South Koreans with suicide tactics during the North Korean conquest of the South.\n\nAmerican tanks at Seoul were attacked by North Korean suicide squads, who used satchel charges. A North Korean soldier named Li Su-Bok, who exploded an American tank with a suicide bomb, is hailed as a hero in North Korean propaganda.\n\nCertain aircraft built or projected for the \"Luftwaffe\" during the time of the Allied bombing before the surrender of Nazi Germany in World War II, such as the Bachem Ba 349, \"Fliegende Panzerfaust\", Sombold So 344, Zeppelin Rammer or the Blohm & Voss BV 40 are sometimes listed as suicide weapons. However, they were not intended as such, even though the chances of survival would have been very limited for the pilots of such dangerous artifacts. In those years Nazi authorities considered the use of \"selbstopfer\" (suicide) planes such as the Messerschmitt Me 328 and the Fieseler 103.\n\nDuring the Cold War, it was argued that the doctrine of mutual assured destruction turned nuclear weapons into suicide weapons. The idea of a Doomsday weapon took this to its logical extreme.\n\nPolitical groups using suicide weapons in the post-Cold War era include mainly outfits affiliated to Islamic terrorism, among which even children have been used in order to escape detection when carrying out suicide attacks. However, non-Islamic groups, such as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, also have been prone to use suicide weapons. Today, the most common suicide weapons used to carry out terrorist attacks are car bombs or truck bombs, as well as antipersonnel bombs carried by a single person. Suicide bombers strap explosives, often covered with nails, screws, or other items intended to act as fragments, to their bodies or otherwise carry them into populated areas and detonate them. The Tamil Tigers of Sri Lanka are known for having made high-profile use of this method in the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi. Similar methods have been also used by Palestinian terrorist groups in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, among others.\n\nKamikaze attacks were mimicked in the September 11, 2001 attacks, in which a group of mostly Saudi terrorists destroyed the World Trade Center and part of the Pentagon by flying hijacked jet airliners into them. It was the first and only time in history that hijacked jet airliners filled with fuel were used as cruise missiles against targets of such magnitude.\n\n\n\n"}

It uses the H.323 protocol for videoconferencing, and is interoperable with OpenH323-based clients such as Ekiga, OpenH323, and Internet Locator Service (ILS) as reflector. It also uses a slightly modified version of the T.120 Protocol for whiteboarding, application sharing (or by extension, desktop sharing), and file transfers.\n\nNetMeeting was released on May 29, 1996, originally bundled with Internet Explorer 3, and later with Internet Explorer 4. It incorporates technology acquired by Microsoft from UK software developer Data Connection Ltd and DataBeam Corporation (subsequently acquired by Lotus).\n\nBefore video service became common on free IM clients, such as Yahoo! Messenger and MSN Messenger, NetMeeting was a popular way to perform video conferences and chatting over the Internet (with the help of public ILS servers, or \"direct-dialing\" to an IP address). The defunct TechTV channel even used NetMeeting as a means of getting viewers onto their call-in shows via webcam, although viewers had to call on their telephones, because broadband Internet connections were still rare.\n\nNetMeeting uses H.323 standard for videoconferencing: It uses G.723.1 and G.711 standards for audio coding and offers bit-rates between 5.3 kbit/s and 64 kbit/s. For video coding, it uses H.263 standard and supports 30 frames per second. NetMeeting multimedia conferencing sessions over the network are established via RTP, UDP and IP network protocol.\n\nApplication sharing, shared whiteboard, chat, and file transfer features use T.120 standard over TCP/IP connections.\n\nAs of Windows XP, the Start menu shortcut to NetMeeting was removed “by design”. Users must start codice_1 manually from the Start menu Run dialog.\n\nAs of Windows Vista, NetMeeting is no longer included with Microsoft Windows. NetMeeting can still be installed and run on the 32-bit versions of Windows Vista as Microsoft published an update for 32-bit versions of Windows Vista on March 22, 2007 that installs NetMeeting 3.02 on Windows Vista Business, Enterprise or Ultimate editions. However, some features are not available in 3.02 such as remote desktop sharing invitations (incoming) and whiteboard area selection. Microsoft has stated that the Vista compatible version is unsupported and is only meant as a transition tool to help support collaboration sessions when used with Windows XP-based computers. On Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise, or Ultimate, users have the option of installing Windows XP Mode to gain access to NetMeeting.\n\nMicrosoft originally recommended using newer applications such as Meeting Space, Remote Desktop, Remote Assistance, Skype, Microsoft Office Live Meeting and SharedView in place of NetMeeting. All except Remote Desktop, Remote Assistance and Skype have been discontinued and none fully replaced NetMeeting. The secondary whiteboard in NetMeeting 2.1 and later uses H.324 protocol.\n\nLive Communications Server, Office Communicator, Microsoft Lync, Skype for Business and now Microsoft Teams can somewhat be considered the successors to NetMeeting in that, like NetMeeting, they support whiteboarding, desktop sharing, and file transfers - however with more features, most prominently IM.\n\n\n"}

Campden tablets allow the amateur brewer to easily measure small quantities of sodium metabisulfite, so it can be used to protect against wild yeast and bacteria without affecting flavour. Untreated cider must frequently suffers from acetobacter contamination causing vinegar spoilage. Yeasts are resistant to the tablets but the acetobacter are easily killed off, hence treatment is important in cider production.\n\nTypical use is one crushed Campden tablet per US gallon (3.8 L) of must or wort. This dosage contributes 67 ppm sulfur dioxide to the wort but the level of active sulfur dioxide diminishes rapidly as it reacts with chlorine and chloramine, and with aldehydes (particularly in wine). Therefore, the concentration of free sulfur dioxide is greatly diminished by the time the beer or wine is consumed. However, when used only for the purpose of dechlorinating tap water before brewing, one tablet will effectively treat 20 US gallons (75 L) of water.\n\nCampden tablets are also used as an anti-oxidizing agent when transferring wine between containers. The sodium metabisulfite in the Campden tablets will trap oxygen that enters the wine, preventing it from doing any harm.\n\nIt is a common misconception that Campden tablets can be used to halt the ferment process in wine before all the available sugars are converted by the yeast, hence controlling the amount of residual sweetness in the final product. This however is not true. In order to halt fermentation, enough Campden tablets would have to be added to render the wine undrinkable. Alternatively, when used in conjunction with potassium sorbate, the yeast population will be greatly reduced and prevented from reproducing. Without the addition of potassium sorbate the yeast population will only be stunned and eventually repopulate if provided with enough fermentable sugars.\n\nCampden tablets typically contain 0.44 g each of sodium metabisulfite (plus filler) and 8 of these are equivalent to one half level teaspoon (2.5 mL) of sodium metabisulfite. Other Campden tablet formulations use potassium matabisulfite. Each is also referred to interchangeably as—sulfites, and the 'bi' can be found as 'di'. In terms of usage, sodium thiosulfate is a closely related compound.\n\nThe name Campden tablet comes from the town of Chipping Campden in Gloucestershire, England, where the original solution was developed in the 1920s by the Fruit and Vegetable Preserving Research Station - now Campden BRI. The idea was then taken up by the Boots Co., who developed the tablet.\n\nCampden tablets are also useful in decontamination and neutralization after exposure to tear gas.\n\nThe molar mass (commonly called molecular weight or MW) of potassium metabisulfite is 222 g/mol, while the molecular weight of sodium metabisulfite is 190 g/mol.\n\nSome people have allergies or intolerance to sulfites. Allergies are less common than intolerance, but in rare cases may cause life-threatening anaphylactic reaction. Products containing residual amounts of sulfites, including potassium metabisulfite and sodium metabisulfite, should be labelled.\n\n"}

While his early recordings were dancehall and reggae, he later moved towards hip hop and rap. His most popular single is the 2003 hit \"No Letting Go\".\n\nWonder was born in Buff Bay, Portland, Jamaica. He sang in Sunday school as a child, and began songwriting at the age of 13, getting a major career break when he was given a regular weekly slot at Metro Media in Allman Town. \n\nHe auditioned at Sonic Sounds studio, but while Sly Dunbar was impressed, his touring commitments with Black Uhuru prevented him from signing Wonder. He had more success, however, with King Tubby, who produced his first single, \"Long and Lasting Love\", in 1985, with two more following. Wonder's career suffered a setback when Tubby was killed in 1988, and he recorded for several other record producers at Sonic Sound, enjoying a further hit with the Lloyd Dennis-produced \"It's Over Now\", leading to the release of his first album, \"No More Chance\", although his success in this era was limited. \n\nHis fortunes improved when he began working with Dave Kelly, a friend from primary school, who had become resident sound engineer at Penthouse Studios. The partnership enjoyed a string of hits, starting with \"Saddest Day\", and they also worked on Wonder's second album, \"Part 2\". His 1990 live performance of Alphaville's \"Forever Young\" was recorded and later released to Alphaville fans in a limited, cassette-only album entitled \"History\". He toured the UK in 1992 along with other Penthouse stars Marcia Griffiths, Tony Rebel, and Buju Banton. He also recorded \"Bonafide Love (Movie Star)\" with Buju Banton, and wrote several early hits for him, including the controversial \"Boom Bye Bye\". He toured again with Banton in 1994 as part of the Penthouse Showcase. Wonder formed the band Alias along with Kelly, Baby Cham, Frisco Kid, and Frankie Sly, and later Entourage.\n\nIn 2000, Wonder launched his own record label, Singso, and his 2000 album \"Da Vibe\" saw him begin to incorporate hip hop into his sound. He collaborated with several other major artists, including Jason Dalyrimple of Soul for Real, Foxy Brown, and Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes, and the move towards hip hop increased with his 2001 album \"Schizophrenic\".\n\nHis career really took off internationally when he signed to Atlantic Records, achieving worldwide success with the song \"No Letting Go\" in 2003. The song is based on the Diwali riddim, which was also used by several other artists that year, such as Sean Paul, Lumidee and Missy Elliott. The single reached No. 11 in the US and No. 3 in the UK.\n\n\"No Letting Go\" and the album \"No Holding Back\" were a major success on urban radio stations in the US, and this prompted the release of several compilation albums featuring older Wonder material, including Trojan Records', \"\" (2005). \n\nA new album, \"Foreva\" was released in 2007. It reached No. 6 on the US Top Reggae Albums chart.\n\nHis album \"May Way\" was released in December 2012. \"Sweet Songs\" is due to be released in 2014.\n\nIn October 2014, he featured on the \"Never Mind the Buzzcocks\" identity parade, where he revealed he now tours selling Yams, joking \"I've sold more Yams than records.\"\n\n"}

He is co-director of Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, co-director of the Wolfgang Kohler Primate Research Center, honorary professor at University of Leipzig and at Manchester University's Department of Psychology, and professor of psychology at Duke University.\n\nEarning many prizes and awards from the end of the 1990s onward, he is considered one of today's most authoritative developmental and comparative psychologists. He is \"one of the few scientists worldwide who is acknowledged as an expert in multiple disciplines\". His \"pioneering research on the origins of social cognition has led to revolutionary insights in both developmental psychology and primate cognition.\"\n\nTomasello was born in Bartow, Florida. He received his bachelor's degree 1972 from Duke University and his doctorate in Experimental Psychology 1980 from University of Georgia.\n\nHe was a professor of psychology and anthropology at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, US, during the 1980s and 1990s. Subsequently, he moved to Germany to work at the Max Planck Institute.\n\nHe works on child language acquisition as a crucially important aspect of the enculturation process. He is a critic of Noam Chomsky's universal grammar, rejecting the idea of an innate universal grammar and instead proposing a functional theory of language development (sometimes called the social-pragmatic or usage-based approach to language acquisition) in which children learn linguistic structures through intention-reading and pattern-finding in their discourse interactions with others.\n\nTomasello also studies broader cognitive skills in a comparative light at the Wolfgang Köhler Primate Research Center in Leipzig. With his research team, he created a set of experimental devices to test toddlers' (from 6 months to 24 months) and apes' spatial, instrumental, and social cognition; the outcome of which is that social (even ultrasocial) cognition is what truly sets human apart. \n\nMore specifically, Tomasello argues that apes lack a series of skills:\n\nTomasello sees these skills as being preceded and encompassed by the capacity to share attention and intention (collective intentionality), an evolutionary novelty that would have emerged as a cooperative integrating of apes skills that formerly worked in competition.\n\nInferring a common need, being motivated to act cooperatively to fulfill this need, coordinating individuals' roles and perspectives under the common goal of fulfilling this common need if, and only if other agent fulfill his commitment toward that goal, and sharing the spoils fairly ; thus can be defined the overall scheme of the sharing of attention and of intention. Tomasello holds such dual structure of commonality and individuality as being a cognitive integration of skills in mind reading, in instrumental action and in simulational thinking (meaning agents use an internal representation of the state of things, and simulate actions and outcomes of these actions). Individuals need to make clear or explicit, by eye contact, by gestural pantomime or else, that they intend to coordinate their actions and perspectives under a common goal. Communicating such a specific intent suggest agents can entertain a sense of forming a \"we\", to which they feel a sense of commitment, such that defecting from collaborating require an apology or a taking leave. Collaborative agents also see their interaction through a representational format amounting to a bird's eye view or view from nowhere, as suggested by their skills at role switching with their partner, and at inferring what is helpful or relevant to help their partner play their role. \n\nTomasello's defense, use and deepening of the shared attention and intention hypothesis rely on the experimental data asserted to above (see also ). Tomasello also resorts to an evolutionary two-step scenario (see below), and to philosophical concepts borrowed from Paul Grice, John Searle, Margaret Gilbert, Michael Bratman, and anthropologist Dan Sperber. \n\nAt one point in time, after the emergence of the genus Homo two millions years ago, Homo Heidelbergensis or other close candidate became obligate foragers and scavengers under ecological pressures (desertification) driving to resources scarcity. Individuals able to avoid free-riders and to divide the spoils with collaborative partners would have gain an adaptive advantage over non cooperators. The heightened dependence on joint effort to gain food and the social selection of partners are taken to account for an evolution toward better skills at coordinating individual's roles and perspectives under a common attentional frame (that of the hunt or scavenging) and under a common goal, giving rise to joint, interpersonal intention. Later, around 200 000 years ago, new ecological pressures presumably posed by competition within groups put those comprising \"loose pool\" of collaborators at a disadvantage against groups of coherently collaborative individuals working for a common territorial defense. \"Individuals [...] began to understand themselves as members of particular social group with a particular identity\".. \n\nFor Tomasello, this two-step evolutionary path of macro ecological pressures impacting micro-level skills in representation, inferences and self-monitoring, does not hold because natural selection would see internal mechanisms. « Cognitive processes are a product of natural selection, but they are not its target. Indeed, natural selection cannot even \"see\" cognition; it can only \"see\" the effects of cognition in organizing and regulating overt actions ».. Ecological pressures would have put prior cooperative or mutualistic behaviors at such an advantage against competition as to create a new selective pressure favoring new cognitive skills, which would have posed new challenges, in an autocatalytic way.\n\nEchoing the phylogenetic path, humans' unique skills at joint and collective intentionality develop during the individual's lifetime by scaffolding, not only on simple skills like distinguishing animate/inanimate matter, but also on the communicative conventions and institutions forming the socio-cultural environment, forming feedback loops that enrich and deepen both cultural ground and individual's prior skills. \"[B]asic skills evolve phylogenetically, enabling the creation of cultural products historically, which then provide developing children with the biological and cultural tools they need to develop ontogenetically\". \n\nThe sharing of attention and of intention is taken to be prior to language in evolutionary time and in an individual's lifetime, while conditioning language's acquisition through the parsing of joint attentional scenes into actors, objects, events and the like. More broadly, Tomasello sees the sharing of attention and of intention as the roots of human cultural world (the roots of conventions, of group identity, of institutions) : \"\"Human reasoning, even when it is done internally with the self, is [...] shot through and through with a kind of collective normativity in which the individuals regulate her actions and thinking based on the group's normative conventions and standards\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

It marks the point where the River Thames meets the North Sea, roughly halfway between Havengore Creek in Essex and Warden Point on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent.\n\nUntil 1964 it marked the seaward limit of the Port of London Authority. As the sandbank was a major hazard for shipping coming in and out of London, in 1732 it received the world's first lightship. This became a major landmark, and was used as an assembly point for shipping. Today it is marked by Sea Reach No. 1 Buoy.\n\nThe Nore gives its name to the anchorage, or open roadstead, used by the Royal Navy's North Sea Fleet, and to the RN Command based there. It was the site of a notorious mutiny in 1797.\n\nThe Nore is a hazard to shipping, so in 1732 the world's first lightship was moored over it in an experiment by Robert Hamblin, who patented the idea. The experiment must have proved successful, because by 1819 England had nine lightships. The Nore lightship was run by Trinity House, General Lighthouse Authority for England (and Wales, the Channel Islands and Gibraltar).\n\nThe early Nore lightships were small wooden vessels, often Dutch-built galliots. By the end of the 19th century a larger ship with a revolving light had appeared, but after about 1915 the authorities ceased to use a lightship. Sea Reach No. 1 Buoy as of 2006 marks the anchorage-point of the former lightship, about midway between Shoeburyness in Essex and the Isle of Sheppey in Kent. This defines the limit of the Thames and the beginning of the North Sea.\n\nThe Nore has been the site of a Royal Navy anchorage since the age of sail, being adjacent to both the city and port of London and to the Medway, England's principal naval base and dockyard on the North Sea.\n\nDuring the French Revolutionary War it was the scene of a notorious mutiny, when seamen protesting against their poor pay and working conditions refused orders and seized control of their ships in May 1797. The mutiny ended in June, but while the ringleaders were punished, much was done by the Admiralty to improve pay and conditions for the seamen. \n\nFrom 1899 to 1955, the Royal Navy maintained a Commander-in-Chief, The Nore, a senior officer responsible for protecting the entrance to the port of London, and merchant traffic along the east coast of Britain. In the First World War the Nore Command principally had a supply and administrative function, but in the Second World War it oversaw naval operations in the North Sea along the East coast of Britain, guarding against invasion and protecting trade.\n\nAlso during the Second World War a series of defensive towers known as Maunsell Forts was built in the Thames estuary to protect the approach to London from air and sea attack. The Nore was the site of one of these, the Great Nore Tower. It was equipped with a battery of anti-aircraft guns and manned by a unit of the British Army. It was completed in 1943, but was abandoned at the end of hostilities. It was badly damaged in a collision in 1953 and dismantled in 1959–1960.\n\n"}

They were peace talks aimed at enhancing the \"final status\" negotiations, to end the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. According to the statement issued by the negotiators at the end of the talks, they came closer to reaching a final settlement than in any previous peace talks. Prime Minister Ehud Barak's government terminated the talks on 27 January 2001 due to the upcoming Israeli election, and the new Sharon government did not restart them.\n\nThe Taba Summit took place from 21 to 27 January 2001 at Taba, after the failed Camp David 2000 Summit between Prime Minister of Israel Ehud Barak and the Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, and against the backdrop of the Second Intifada that commenced. The parties had first negotiated at Bolling Air Force Base in Washington, hosted by President Bill Clinton from 19 to 23 December 2000. The Israelis under Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami, the Palestinian under senior negotiator Saeb Erekat, Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo and Gaza security chief Mohammed Dahlan. President Clinton presented bridging proposals (the so-called \"Clinton Parameters\"). A summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, mediated by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, was planned on 28 December. As the Palestinians delayed their acceptance of the Clinton Parameters, Barak decided not to go.\n\nAt the start of the Taba Summit, Israel held on three main points:\n\nJanuary 2001, the European Special Representative to the Middle East Process Miguel Moratinos presented a document, known as \"The Moratinos non-paper,\" describing the outcome of the Taba negotiations. Although the paper has no official status, it has been acknowledged by the parties as being a relatively fair description of the outcome of the negotiations on the permanent status issues at Taba. It describes observed positions on the permanent status issues territory, Jerusalem, refugees and security, in order to find ways to come to joint positions. \"At the same time it shows that there are serious gaps and differences between the two sides, which will have to be overcome in future negotiations.\" Summary of the paper:\n\nThe two sides agreed that in accordance with the UN Security Council Resolution 242, the 4 June 1967 lines would be the basis for the borders between Israel and the Palestinian state. Israel reduced its demands to 6% with territorial compensation that would offset about 3%, while the Palestinians proposed an Israeli annexation of about 3% along with a territorial compensation of the same amount. The Israeli proposal would have given the Palestinians some 97% of the land area of the West Bank.\n\nBoth sides presented their own maps of the West Bank. The maps served as a basis for the discussion on territory and settlements. The Israeli side presented two maps, and the Palestinian side engaged on this basis. The Palestinian side presented some illustrative maps detailing its understanding of Israeli interests in the West Bank. The Israeli side stated that the Clinton proposals provide for annexation of Settlement blocs, areas which only had a small number of Palestinians. The Palestinian side did not agree that the parameters included blocs, and did not accept proposals to annex blocs. The Palestinian side stated that blocs would cause significant harm to the Palestinian interests and rights, particularly to the Palestinians residing in areas Israel sought to annex.\n\nNeither side presented any maps of the Gaza Strip. It was implied that the Gaza Strip would be under total Palestinian sovereignty, but details still had to be worked out. All settlements would be evacuated. The Palestinian side claimed it could be arranged in 6 months, a timetable not agreed to by the Israeli side. Both sides agreed that there was going to be a safe passage from the north of Gaza (Beit Hanun) to the Hebron district, and that the West Bank and the Gaza Strip must be territorially linked.\n\nBoth sides accepted in principle the Clinton suggestion of having a Palestinian sovereignty over Arab neighborhoods and an Israeli sovereignty over Jewish neighborhoods in Jerusalem. Both sides favored the idea of an open city. The Israeli side accepted that Jerusalem would be the capital of the two states: \"Yerushalaim\", capital of Israel and \"Al-Quds\", capital of the state of Palestine. Both parties accepted the principle of respective control over each side's respective holy sites. Israel's sovereignty over the Western Wall would be recognized although there remained a dispute regarding the delineation of the area covered by the Western Wall and especially the link to what is referred to in Clinton's ideas as the space sacred to Judaism of which it is part. Both sides agreed that the question of \"Haram al-Sharif\"/Temple Mount has not been resolved.\n\nNon-papers were exchanged which were regarded as a good basis for the talks. Both sides agreed to adopt the principles and references which could facilitate the adoption of an agreement. Both sides suggested, as a basis, that the parties should agree that a just settlement of the refugee problem in accordance with the UN Security Council Resolution 242 must lead to the implementation of UN General Assembly Resolution 194. The Israeli side expressed its understanding that the wish to return shall be implemented within the framework of one of the following programs:\n\nA. Return and repatriation\n\nB. Rehabilitation and relocation\n\nBoth sides agreed that UNRWA should be phased out in accordance with an agreed timetable of five years, as a targeted period.\n\nThe Israeli side requested that the issue of compensation to Jewish immigrants from Arab countries be recognized, while accepting that it was not a Palestinian responsibility or a bilateral issue. The Palestinian side raised the issue of restitution of refugee property. The Israeli side rejected this.\n\n\nIsrael wanted to keep military control over Palestinian land and airspace in states of emergency, not because of a possible future threat from Palestine, but because of possible other threats from the East. The Palestinians wanted to accept international forces only.\n\nThe Palestinians could not accept Israeli annexation of Giv'at Ze'ev and Ma'ale Adumim in the Jerusalem area. Israel wanted future expansion of the settlements into the West Bank. Unlike the Palestinians, Israel did not consider East Jerusalem part of the West Bank and its Israeli inhabitants settlers.\n\nThe Taba Summit officially ended with a joint statement, that included some of the following points:\n\nThe breakdown is often attributed to the political circumstances posed by Israeli elections and changeover in leadership in the United States: They had run out of political time. They couldn't conclude an agreement with Clinton now out of office and Barak standing for reelection in two weeks. \"We made progress, substantial progress. We are closer than ever to the possibility of striking a final deal,\" said Shlomo Ben-Ami, Israel's negotiator. Saeb Erekat, Palestinian chief negotiator, said, \"My heart aches because I know we were so close. We need six more weeks to conclude the drafting of the agreement.\"\n\nThe following month the Likud party candidate Ariel Sharon defeated Ehud Barak in the Israeli elections and was elected as Israeli prime minister on 6 February 2001. Sharon's new government chose not to resume the high-level talks. Immediately after the elections and before the change of government, an 8 February 2001 statement published by the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that:\n\nIn June 2002, amidst claims he had lost control over militant groups, Yasser Arafat said in an Haaretz interview that he was willing to accept the Taba proposal. The Israeli government replied saying the offer was no longer valid.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1804305", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1804305", "title": "Cognitive semantics", "text": "Cognitive semantics\n\nCognitive semantics is part of the cognitive linguistics movement. Semantics is the study of linguistic meaning. Cognitive semantics holds that language is part of a more general human cognitive ability, and can therefore only describe the world as people conceive of it. It is implicit that different linguistic communities conceive of simple things and processes in the world differently (different cultures), not necessarily some difference between a person's conceptual world and the real world (wrong beliefs).\n\nThe main tenets of cognitive semantics are:\n\nAs part of the field of cognitive linguistics, the cognitive semantics approach rejects the traditional separation of linguistics into phonology, morphology, syntax, pragmatics, etc. Instead, it divides semantics into \"meaning-construction\" and \"knowledge representation\". Therefore, cognitive semantics studies much of the area traditionally devoted to pragmatics as well as semantics. \n\nThe techniques native to cognitive semantics are typically used in lexical studies such as those put forth by Leonard Talmy, George Lakoff, Dirk Geeraerts, and Bruce Wayne Hawkins. Some cognitive semantic frameworks, such as that developed by Talmy, take into account syntactic structures as well.\n\nAs a field, semantics is interested in three big questions: what does it mean for units of language, called lexemes, to have \"meaning\"? What does it mean for sentences to have meaning? Finally, how is it that meaningful units fit together to compose complete sentences? These are the main points of inquiry behind studies into lexical semantics, structural semantics, and theories of compositionality (respectively). In each category, traditional theories seem to be at odds with those accounts provided by cognitive semanticists.\n\nClassic theories in semantics (in the tradition of Alfred Tarski and Donald Davidson) have tended to explain the meaning of parts in terms of \"necessary and sufficient conditions\", sentences in terms of \"truth-conditions\", and composition in terms of \"propositional functions\". Each of these positions is tightly related to the others. According to these traditional theories, the meaning of a particular sentence may be understood as the conditions under which the proposition conveyed by the sentence hold true. For instance, the expression \"snow is white\" is true if and only if snow is, in fact, white. Lexical units can be understood as holding meaning either by virtue of set of things they may apply to (called the \"extension\" of the word), or in terms of the common properties that hold between these things (called its \"intension\"). The intension provides an interlocutor with the necessary and sufficient conditions that let a thing qualify as a member of some lexical unit's extension. Roughly, propositional functions are those abstract instructions that guide the interpreter in taking the free variables in an open sentence and filling them in, resulting in a correct understanding of the sentence as a whole.\n\nMeanwhile, cognitive semantic theories are typically built on the argument that lexical meaning is conceptual. That is, meaning is not necessarily reference to the entity or relation in some real or possible world. Instead, meaning corresponds with a concept held in the mind based on personal understanding. As a result, semantic facts like \"All bachelors are unmarried males\" are not treated as special facts about our language practices; rather, these facts are not distinct from encyclopaedic knowledge. In treating linguistic knowledge as being a piece with everyday knowledge, the question is raised: how can cognitive semantics explain paradigmatically semantic phenomena, like category structure? Set to the challenge, researchers have drawn upon theories from related fields, like cognitive psychology and cognitive anthropology. One proposal is to treat in order to explain category structure in terms of \"nodes\" in a \"knowledge network\". One example of a theory from cognitive science that has made its way into the cognitive semantic mainstream is the theory of prototypes, which cognitive semanticists generally argue is the cause of polysemy. \n\nCognitive semanticists argue that truth-conditional semantics is unduly limited in its account of full sentence meaning. While they are not on the whole hostile to truth-conditional semantics, they point out that it has limited explanatory power. That is to say, it is limited to indicative sentences, and does not seem to offer any straightforward or intuitive way of treating (say) commands or expressions. By contrast, cognitive semantics seeks to capture the full range of grammatical moods by also making use of the notions of framing and mental spaces.\n\nAnother trait of cognitive semantics is the recognition that meaning is not fixed but a matter of construal and conventionalization. The processes of linguistic construal, it is argued, are the same psychological processes involved in the processing of encyclopaedic knowledge and in perception. This view has implications for the problem of compositionality. An account in cognitive semantics called the dynamic construal theory makes the claim that words themselves are without meaning: they have, at best, \"default construals,\" which are really just ways of using words. Along these lines, cognitive semantics argues that compositionality can only be intelligible if pragmatic elements like context and intention are taken into consideration.\n\nCognitive semantics has sought to challenge traditional theories in two ways: first, by providing an account of the meaning of sentences by going beyond truth-conditional accounts; and second, by attempting to go beyond accounts of word meaning that appeal to necessary and sufficient conditions. It accomplishes both by examining the structure of concepts.\n\nFrame semantics, developed by Charles J. Fillmore, attempts to explain meaning in terms of their relation to general \"understanding\", not just in the terms laid out by truth-conditional semantics. Fillmore explains meaning in general (including the meaning of lexemes) in terms of \"\"frames\"\". By \"frame\" is meant any concept that can only be understood if a larger system of concepts is also understood.\n\nMany pieces of linguistic evidence motivate the frame-semantic project. First, it has been noted that word meaning is an extension of our bodily and cultural experiences. For example, the notion of \"restaurant\" is associated with a series of concepts, like \"food, service, waiters, tables, and eating\". These rich-but-contingent associations cannot be captured by an analysis in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions, yet they still seem to be intimately related to our understanding of \"restaurant\".\n\nSecond, and more seriously, these conditions are not enough to account for asymmetries in the ways that words are used. According to a semantic feature analysis, there is nothing more to the meanings of \"boy\" and \"girl\" than:\n\n\nAnd there is surely some truth to this proposal. Indeed, cognitive semanticists understand the instances of the concept held by a given certain word may be said to exist in a \"schematic relation\" with the concept itself. And this is regarded as a legitimate approach to semantic analysis, so far as it goes.\n\nHowever, linguists have found that language users regularly apply the terms \"boy\" and \"girl\" in ways that go beyond mere semantic features. That is, for instance, people tend to be more likely to consider a young female a \"girl\" (as opposed to \"woman\"), than they are to consider a borderline-young male a \"boy\" (as opposed to \"man\"). This fact suggests that there is a latent frame, made up of cultural attitudes, expectations, and background assumptions, which is part of word meaning. These background assumptions go up and beyond those necessary and sufficient conditions that correspond to a semantic feature account. Frame semantics, then, seeks to account for these puzzling features of lexical items in some systematic way.\n\nThird, cognitive semanticists argue that truth-conditional semantics is incapable of dealing adequately with some aspects of the meanings at the level of the sentence. Take the following:\n\n\nIn this case, the truth-conditions of the claim expressed by the antecedent in the sentence are not being denied by the proposition expressed after the clause. Instead, what is being denied is the way that the antecedent is framed.\n\nFinally, with the frame-semantic paradigm's analytical tools, the linguist is able to explain a wider range of semantic phenomena than they would be able to with only necessary and sufficient conditions. Some words have the same definitions or intensions, and the same extensions, but have subtly different domains. For example, the lexemes \"land\" and \"ground\" are synonyms, yet they naturally contrast with different things—\"sea\" and \"air\", respectively. \n\nAs we have seen, the frame semantic account is by no means limited to the study of lexemes—with it, researchers may examine expressions at more complex levels, including the level of the sentence (or, more precisely, the utterance). The notion of framing is regarded as being of the same cast as the pragmatic notion of \"background assumptions\". Philosopher of language John Searle explains the latter by asking readers to consider sentences like \"The cat is on the mat\". For such a sentence to make any sense, the interpreter makes a series of assumptions: i.e., that there is gravity, the cat is parallel to the mat, and the two touch. For the sentence to be intelligible, the speaker supposes that the interpreter has an idealized or default frame in mind.\n\nAn alternate strain of Fillmore's analysis can be found in the work of Ronald Langacker, who makes a distinction between the notions of \"profile\" and \"base\". The profile is the concept symbolized by the word itself, while the base is the encyclopedic knowledge that the concept presupposes. For example, let the definition of \"radius\" be \"a line segment that joins the center of a circle with any point on its circumference\". If all we know of the concept \"radius\" is its profile, then we simply know that it is a line segment that is attached to something called the \"circumference\" in some greater whole called the \"circle\". That is to say, our understanding is fragmentary until the base concept of \"circle\" is firmly grasped.\n\nWhen a single base supports a number of different profiles, then it can be called a \"\"domain\"\". For instance, the concept profiles of \"arc, center, and circumference\" are all in the domain of \"circle\", because each uses the concept of \"circle\" as a base. We are then in a position to characterize the notion of a frame as being either the base of the concept profile, or (more generally) the domain that the profile is a part of.\n\nA major divide in the approaches to cognitive semantics lies in the puzzle surrounding the nature of category structure. As mentioned in the previous section, semantic feature analyses fall short of accounting for the frames that categories may have. An alternative proposal would have to go beyond the minimalistic models given by classical accounts, and explain the richness of detail in meaning that language speakers attribute to categories.\n\n\"Prototype theories\", investigated by Eleanor Rosch, have given some reason to suppose that many natural lexical category structures are graded, i.e., they have prototypical members that are considered to be \"better fit\" the category than other examples. For instance, robins are generally viewed as better examples of the category \"bird\" than, say, penguins. If this view of category structure is the case, then categories can be understood to have central and peripheral members, and not just be evaluated in terms of members and non-members.\n\nIn a related vein, George Lakoff, following the later Ludwig Wittgenstein, noted that some categories are only connected to one another by way of \"family resemblances\". While some classical categories may exist, i.e., which are structured by necessary and sufficient conditions, there are at least two other kinds: \"generative\" and \"radial\". \n\n\"Generative categories\" can be formed by taking central cases and applying certain principles to designate category membership. The principle of similarity is one example of a rule that might generate a broader category from given prototypes.\n\n\"Radial categories\" are categories motivated by conventions, but not predictable from rules. The concept of \"mother\", for example, may be explained in terms of a variety of conditions that may or may not be sufficient. Those conditions may include: being married, has always been female, gave birth to the child, supplied half the child's genes, is a caregiver, is married to the genetic father, is one generation older than the child, and is the legal guardian. Any one of the above conditions might not be met: for instance, a \"single mother\" does not need to be married, and a \"surrogate mother\" does not necessarily provide nurturance. When these aspects collectively cluster together, they form a prototypical case of what it means to be a mother, but nevertheless they fail to outline the category crisply. Variations upon the central meaning are established by convention by the community of language users.\n\nFor Lakoff, prototype effects can be explained in large part due to the effects of idealized cognitive models. That is, domains are organized with an ideal notion of the world that may or may not fit reality. For example, the word \"bachelor\" is commonly defined as \"unmarried adult male\". However, this concept has been created with a particular ideal of what a bachelor is like: an adult, uncelibate, independent, socialized, and promiscuous. Reality might either strain the expectations of the concept, or create false positives. That is, people typically want to widen the meaning of \"bachelor\" to include exceptions like \"a sexually active seventeen-year-old who lives alone and owns his own firm\" (not technically an adult but seemingly still a bachelor), and this can be considered a kind of straining of the definition. Moreover, speakers would tend to want to exclude from the concept of \"bachelor\" certain false positives, such as those adult unmarried males that don't bear much resemblance to the ideal: i.e., the Pope, or Tarzan. Prototype effects may also be explained as a function of either basic-level categorization and typicality, closeness to an ideal, or stereotyping.\n\nSo viewed, prototype theory seems to give an account of category structure. However, there are a number of criticisms of this interpretation of the data. Indeed, Rosch and Lakoff, themselves chief advocates of prototype theory, have emphasized in their later works that the findings of prototype theory do not necessarily tell us anything about category structure. Some theorists in the cognitive semantics tradition have challenged both classical and prototype accounts of category structure by proposing the dynamic construal account, where category structure is always created \"on-line\"—and so, that categories have no structure outside of the context of use.\n\nIn traditional semantics, the meaning of a sentence is the situation it represents, and the situation can be described in terms of the possible world that it would be true of. Moreover, sentence meanings may be dependent upon propositional attitudes: those features that are relative to someone's beliefs, desires, and mental states. The role of propositional attitudes in truth-conditional semantics is controversial. However, by at least one line of argument, truth-conditional semantics seems to be able to capture the meaning of belief-sentences like \"Frank believes that the Red Sox will win the next game\" by appealing to propositional attitudes. The meaning of the overall proposition is described as a set of abstract conditions, wherein Frank holds a certain propositional attitude, and the attitude is itself a relationship between Frank and a particular proposition; and this proposition is the possible world where the Red Sox win the next game.\n\nStill, many theorists have grown dissatisfied with the inelegance and dubious ontology behind possible-worlds semantics. An alternative can be found in the work of Gilles Fauconnier. For Fauconnier, the meaning of a sentence can be derived from \"mental spaces\". Mental spaces are cognitive structures entirely in the minds of interlocutors. In his account, there are two kinds of mental space. The \"base space\" is used to describe reality (as it is understood by both interlocutors). \"Space builders\" (or \"built space\") are those mental spaces that go beyond reality by addressing possible worlds, along with temporal expressions, fictional constructs, games, and so on. Additionally, Fauconnier semantics distinguishes between \"roles\" and \"values\". A semantic role is understood to be description of a category, while values are the instances that make up the category. (In this sense, the role-value distinction is a special case of the type-token distinction.) \n\nFauconnier argues that curious semantic constructions can be explained handily by the above apparatus. Take the following sentence:\n\n\nThe semanticist must construct an explanation for the obvious fact that the above sentence is not contradictory. Fauconnier constructs his analysis by observing that there are two mental spaces (the present-space and the 1929-space). His \"access principle\" supposes that \"a value in one space can be described by the role its counterpart in another space has, even if that role is invalid for the value in the first space\". So, to use the example above, the value in 1929-space is \"the blonde\", while she is being described with the role of \"the lady with white hair\" in present-day space.\n\nAs we have seen, cognitive semantics gives a treatment of issues in the construction of meaning both at the level of the sentence and the level of the lexeme in terms of the structure of concepts. However, it is not entirely clear what cognitive processes are at work in these accounts. Moreover, it is not clear how we might go about explaining the ways that concepts are actively employed in conversation. It appears to be the case that, if our project is to look at \"how\" linguistic strings convey different semantic content, we must first catalogue \"what\" cognitive processes are being used to do it. Researchers can satisfy both requirements by attending to the \"construal operations\" involved in language processing—that is to say, by investigating the ways that people \"structure their experiences\" through language.\n\nLanguage is full of conventions that allow for subtle and nuanced conveyances of experience. To use an example that is readily at hand, framing is all-pervasive, and it may extend across the full breadth of linguistic data, extending from the most complex utterances, to tone, to word choice, to expressions derived from the composition of morphemes. Another example is \"image-schemata\", which are ways that we structure and understand the elements of our experience driven by any given sense.\n\nAccording to linguists William Croft and D. Alan Cruse, there are four broad cognitive abilities that play an active part in the construction of construals. They are: attention/salience, judgment/comparison, situatedness, and constitution/gestalt. Each general category contains a number of subprocesses, each of which helps to explain the ways we encode experience into language in some unique way.\n\n"}

Through these stage revues Grahame also met his longtime musical, writing and acting partner Rory O'Donoghue, who had begun his performing career playing The Artful Dodger in a Sydney production of the musical \"Oliver!\" as well as being the lead singer and guitarist in the Sydney rock bands The Pogs and Oakapple Day. Rory was only 14 at the time he met Bond, when The Pogs were brought in to provide musical backing for one of the Architecture Revues.\n\nAfter graduating, Grahame and friends continued working together on a wide range of projects in radio, theatre, TV and film. He collaborated on several short films and stage pieces with Peter Weir, and wrote and played in a number of stage comedies and revues. The success of Bond's work in the Architecture Revues led to a professional stage revue for the PACT Theatre Company, \"Balloon Dubloon\" (1969) with Peter Weir, which in turn led to an invitation from festival director Sir Robert Helpmann to stage a revue, \"Drip Dry Dreams\" at the Adelaide Festival and Richbrooke.\n\nThrough Bob Allnutt, a staffer at the PACT Theatre Company who also worked for the ABC's Religious Affairs Department, Weir, Bond and friends were commissioned to produce a TV special, \"Man On A Green Bike\", a fantasy that examined three different views of Christmas; this screened on ABC-TV at the end of December 1969. The 50-minute film, which was Bond's first known TV appearance, was co-written by and starred Bond and Peter Weir, with Geoff Malone, James Dellit, and Anna Nygh. The story concerned three men, once friends sharing many adventures, who are now mayors of three cities—medieval Ackley, the futuristic Cadmium, and Petal Lake, a community reminiscent of the 1930s. Into their midst comes the strange figure of Mr. Maloon, a man travelling on a heavily laden green bike, whose presence disturbs and embarrasses the mayors.\n\nDuring 1970 Bond, Weir and co. created and performed the revue \"Filth\" at the Phillip St Revue, followed by \"Hamlet On Ice\" at the Nimrod Theatre. Bond's friendship with Weir led to him writing the music for the three-part AFI Award-winning 1970 film \"Three To Go\" (in which he also had a small acting role), for which Weir directed one segment. Bond also provided the music and played a leading role in Weir's first film, the 1971 short feature \"Homesdale\".\n\nAunty Jack was created for a proposed ABC Radio children's radio series, \"The Aunty Jack Show\", commissioned by Paddy Conroy (former head of ABC TV and now cable channel manager). It was intended to replace the long-running children's radio series \"The Argonauts Club\", which was about to be cancelled. The new series never went to air because ABC executives felt that the Aunty Jack character and some of Grahame's songs were \"inappropriate\" for young listeners.\n\nThe Aunty Jack character made her TV debut in \"Aunty Jack's Travelling Show\", an episode of ABC-TV's \"The Comedy Game\", broadcast in late 1971. It was originally to be called \"Aunty Jack's Travelling Abattoirs\" but ABC executives also found the title inappropriate. The program featured Bond, O'Donoghue and Derum, with Sharman Mellick and Kate Fitzpatrick in supporting roles.\n\nThis marked the start of a fruitful partnership between Bond, O'Donoghue and ABC writer, producer and director Maurice Murphy. They became the creative nucleus for a string of programs that strongly influenced TV comedy in Australia.\n\nAlthough frequently compared to \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\", as the two teams evidently shared the same love of surreal humour, the Aunty Jack character appeared well before The British show was screened in Australia. The Goons have also been mentioned as an inspiration, but in Johnson and Smiedt's history of Australian comedy \"Boom Boom\", Bond himself said that he had listened to The Goons only occasionally. He mentioned Australian radio star Jack Davey, Bob Dyer, \"the Mickey Mouse Club\" and \"The Steve Allen Show\" as early interests, but cited the surreal black humour of Joseph Heller's novel \"Catch-22\" as a major comedic influence.\n\nPeter Weir was also involved behind the scenes in the early days of the series. He had been part of the university revues they had done together in the 1960s, and had a small part in \"Homesdale\" and was credited as a writer on the \"Aunty Jack's Travelling Show\" and four episodes of the subsequent series. He gave up performing just before \"The Aunty Jack Show\", saying in a later interview: \"We were very much in the vein of Monty Python, and I saw them in England and they were so superior to what we did… that was it. I told my writing partner I wanted to focus on films, I sold him my sketches and that was it. It was very difficult because he had just gotten a TV deal.\"\n\nMaurice Murphy was a pivotal figure in this fertile era of Australian television comedy—he oversaw \"Aunty Jack\" and its various spin-off series, and also acted as a vital buffer between the Aunty Jack creative team and the ABC's conservative management. Ted Robinson, then a young director, got his break working for Murphy on the second series of \"Aunty Jack\". Robinson later took over Murphy's mantle in the 1980s, producing some of the best Australian TV comedy series of the period, including \"The Big Gig\" and \"The Gillies Report\". Interviewed for \"Mouthing Off\", a history of Australian comedy, Robinson enthusiastically sang Murphy's praises:\n\n\"Aunty Jack's Travelling Show\" convinced the ABC to commission a short series, to be screened weekly. \"The Aunty Jack Show\" premiered on 16 November 1972 and became an immediate cult hit with younger audiences, although it was poorly received by critics. Some viewers found it too confronting, and according to Murphy, the ABC received hundreds of calls after the first episode, complaining about the violence, the \"bad language\" and especially about the drag aspect of the Aunty Jack character.\n\nThe adverse reaction was reportedly strong enough for the ABC to seriously consider taking the series off the air, but it is generally reported that impassioned pleas from the children of certain ABC executives saved the show from being cancelled. This would not be the team's last such run-in with management, however, and the tensions between the creative and bureaucratic elements in the ABC eventually came to a head with \"The Off Show\" in 1977.\n\nBond cancelled the show at the end of the second season by having Aunty Jack die of a heart attack, 'mortified' by the other cast members' 'dirty' language and content. Nevertheless, the cast was revived and returned for a special two years later to mark the inauguration of colour television in Australia on 1 March 1975. The special beat ABC's commercial rivals by beginning 3 minutes early, at 11:57 pm 28 February 1975 in black and white and then wiping to colour at midnight.\n\nTwo series of \"The Aunty Jack Show\" were made in 1972 and 1973 respectively. The first series comprised seven episodes, the second six episodes. There were also two specials, one aired 8 June 1973 before the second series began in October, and a second aired in 1975 and an unaired pilot, before the series started. Each episode was built around a central theme.\n\nRegular cast:\n\n\"Aunty Jack\" alternated one-off sketches with segments featuring many regular and semi-regular characters. All episodes featured segments with Aunty Jack and her sidekicks — Flange Desire (Sandra McGregor), Thin Arthur (Rory O'Donoghue) and, in the first season the Narrator Neville (John Derum) who was replaced in the second season by Kid Eager (Garry McDonald), a parodic amalgam of characters like Dennis the Menace and Ginger Meggs. There were also semi-regular appearances by the folk-singing duo Errol and Neil (Grahame & Rory), and rock'n'roll butcher Kev Kavanagh (Bond), a character that he had introduced (as \"Mr Kevin\") in Peter Weir's \"Homesdale\".\n\nDerum left the show after Series 1, wishing to pursue other interests. Derum appeared in archival footage in the special, Aunty Jack Rox On, and was replaced in Series 2 by a new cast member, Garry McDonald, a talented young actor, comedian and musician, who had recently graduated from the National Institute of Dramatic Art. His main role was as Aunty Jack's new sidekick, the cheeky, gum-chewing, freckle-faced Kid Eager. In one episode McDonald premiered a new character, devised by a viewer who had taken up a writing course and was inspired by the first episodes to write and submit scripts, which were welcomed by the team. This character featured only briefly in \"Aunty Jack\", but became much more prominent in the spin-off \"Wollongong the Brave\" as the Wollongong media 'un-personality' Norman Gunston. The Gunston character also appeared on the \"Aunty Jack Sings Wollongong\" LP and starred in the Logie-winning Tonight Show parody, \"The Norman Gunston Show\", which premiered in 1975.\n\nSome of the sketches over the two series included the following:\n\nA compilation of colour filmed segments from the first series was edited into an 85-minute feature \"The Very Best of The Aunty Jack Show\" which was screened at the 1973 Montreux Film Festival. It was not seen by Australian audiences until it was broadcast on ABC television on 26 January 1991.\n\nThe popularity of the series led to a one-off TV special, \"Aunty Jack Rox On\" with special guest Stevie Wright, a concert tour, a #1 hit single, \"Farewell Aunty Jack\" (a version of the closing theme of the series) and a best-selling album \"Aunty Jack Sings Wollongong\", released in early 1974. \"Farewell Aunty Jack\" was released as a single in December 1973, reached Number 1 on the Australian charts a week later, where it stayed for 3 weeks. It was the first Australian single in picture-disc form to hit No.1 nationally, reputedly being the first disc of its kind in the world (although \"Goondiwindi Grey\" by Tex Morton in 1972 had also been issued in Australia as a picture disc too, but didn't hit the top spot nationally).\n\nBy the time Series 2 was underway Bond was already tired of Aunty Jack so he decided to kill her off in the final episode, \"The R-Certificate Show\" when, shocked by the gratuitous sex and nudity, Aunty Jack expires from a heart attack. Bond then departed for a much-needed holiday on Norfolk Island where, jointly inspired by the convict ruins and his holiday reading, Errol Flynn's \"My Wicked Wicked Ways\", he came up with the concept for a new series set in the bushranger days, which became \"Flash Nick From Jindivik\".\n\nThe next outing for the classic Aunty Jack team was \"Wollongong the Brave\" (1974), a series of four one-hour specials that showcased favourite characters from the series. Episode 1 \"Aunty Jack'n'The Gong in Bloody Concert\" featured the core characters, augmented by a rock group. Episode 2 featured 'Country and Mediterranean' music group The Farelly Brothers and their singing sheep Jason; Episode 3 featured meat guru Kev Kavanagh and the final instalment \"Norman Gunston: The Golden Weeks\" eventually spawned \"The Norman Gunston Show\" in late 1975.\n\nAt 11:57 PM on Friday 28 February 1975, Aunty Jack, Thin Arthur, and Kid Eager introduced colour television broadcasting on ABC-TV, beating another channel's first colour program by deliberately starting three minutes early. The team's last major TV collaboration was the abortive comedy series \"The Off Show\" (1977) which was cancelled after only a few episodes following a controversial incident in which ABC executive Alan Batemen pulled the premiere episode from the schedule half an hour before it was due to air and then erased the tape, reportedly because he was offended by the Bill Harding religious parody sketch \"Leave It To Jesus\".\n\nAlthough fans long hoped that the show might be released on home video, it was more than thirty years after the show's first screening until this took place. Although there have been a number of reasons suggested, it is generally accepted that the major stumbling block was a long-running disagreement between Bond and the ABC, stemming from Bond and O'Donoghue's resentment over the presumed loss of several \"Aunty Jack\" episodes and the \"Off Show\" incident. Since Bond and O'Donoghue controlled the rights for all the original music featured in the series, their refusal to release them effectively kept the series off home video until 2005.\n\nFor many years there were persistent rumours—fuelled by press statements from Bond himself—that some episodes had been lost or destroyed. This was given added credence by the fact that (like the BBC) the ABC had undertaken an \"economy drive\" in the late 1970s and early 1980s, during which (it has been reported) that substantial portions of many shows were erased.\n\nAlthough (according to Bond) the original master tapes for three episodes were erased, all the original film footage shot for the missing episodes had survived and with the assistance of the National Archives of Australia the footage was located and restored, enabling the missing episodes to be reconstructed. The long-awaited release of the complete Series 1 on DVD took place in December 2005, and the complete Series 2 followed in April 2006. Although the master videotapes were monochrome, and the main episodes are presented in this format on DVD, much of the footage for the series was filmed in colour and these are included as alternate scenes. The only episode in the entire Aunty Jack Show series not to be released on DVD was the 1973 special, 'Aunty Jack Rox On'.\n\nIn 2019, \"TV Week\" listed \"The Aunty Jack Show\" at #99 in its list of the 101 greatest Australian television shows of all time, which appeared in its monthly \"TV Week Close Up\" publication. The magazine said the character's aggressive attitude, her golden boxing glove and her \"I'll rip yer bloody arms off\" catchprase quickly established her, and the show, as comedy icons.\nAunty Jack returned in early 2006 in a live stage show titled \"The Aunty Jack Show and Tell\", starring Grahame Bond and Rory O'Donoghue. As well as Aunty Jack and Thin Arthur, the show featured the singing tramps Neil and Errol, Country and Eastern music exponents the Farrelly Brothers, the Ri Fol Tit Men and bodgie butcher and meat artist Kev Kavanagh.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1804336", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1804336", "title": "Kakatiya dynasty", "text": "Kakatiya dynasty\n\nThe Kakatiya dynasty was a South Indian dynasty whose capital was Orugallu, now known as Warangal. It was eventually conquered by the Delhi Sultanate.\n\nThe demise of Kakatiya dynasty resulted in confusion and anarchy under alien rulers for sometime, before the Musunuri Nayaks brought stability to the region.\n\nStudies of the inscriptions and coinage by the historian Dineshchandra Sircar reveal that there was no contemporary standard spelling of the family name. Variants include \"Kakatiya\", \"Kakatiyya\", \"Kakita\", \"Kakati\" and \"Kakatya\". The family name was often prefixed to the name of the monarch, giving constructs such as \"Kakatiya-Prataparudra\". Some of the monarchs also had alternate names; for example, \"Venkata\" and \"Venkataraya\" may have been alternate names of Prataparuda I, with the former appearing on a coin in the form \"Venkata-Kakatiya\".\n\nThe dynasty's name derives from the word \"Kakati\", which is variously thought to be the name of a goddess or a place. It is possible that Kakati was the name of a deity worshipped by the early Kakatiya chiefs, and also the name of the place where they resided.\n\nKumarasvami Somapithin, a 15th-century writer who wrote a commentary on Vidyanatha's \"Prataparudriya\", states that the dynasty was named after Kakati, a form of goddess Durga. Although the Hindu mythological texts do not mention any such form of Durga, the worship of a goddess named Kakati is attested by several other sources. For example, Vallabharaya's \"Krida-bhiramamu\" mentions an image of Kakatamma (Mother Kakati) in the Kakatiya capital Orugallu. the 16th century Shitap Khan inscription mentions the reinstallation of the image of goddess Jaganmatrika (mother of the universe) and the lotus seat of the Kakatirajya, which had been destroyed by the Turushkas (Turkic people). According to one theory, Kakati was originally a Jain goddess (possibly Padmavati), and later came to be regarded as a form of Durga.\n\nThe Bayyaram tank inscription from the reign of Ganapati-deva names the family's founder as Venna, and states that he resided at Kakati, because of which his descendants came to be known as Kakatishas. Ganapati-deva's Garavapadu charter names the family's founder as Durjaya, and states that his descendant Karikala Chola arrived at a town called Kakati during a hunting expedition, and set up his camp there. The modern identity of Kakati is uncertain: different historians have variously attempted to identify it with modern Kakati village in Karnataka and Kanker in Chhattisgarh. \"Siddeshvara Charitra\", a later literary work, states that the ancestors of the Kakatiya family lived at Kandarapura (identified with modern Kandhar in Maharashtra). However, no other evidence supports this tradition.\n\nMuch of the information about the Kakatiya period comes from inscriptions, including around 1,000 stone inscriptions, and 12 copper-plate inscriptions. Most of these inscriptions document matters relating to religion, such as donations to Hindu temples. They are particularly abundant for the period 1175–1324 CE, which is the period when the dynasty most flourished and are a reflection of that. The probability is that many inscriptions have been lost due to buildings falling into disuse and also the ravages of subsequent rulers, most notably the Muslim Mughal Empire in the Telangana region. Inscriptions are still being discovered today but governmental agencies tend to concentrate on recording those that are already known rather than searching for new examples. According to a 1978 book, written bby P.V.P. Sastry's 1978 book on the history of the Kakatiyas, published by the Government of Andhra Pradesh\n\nInformation about the Kakatiya period also comes from Sanskrit and Telugu literary works written during Kakatiya and post-Kakatiya period. The most notable among these works include \"Prataparudriyam\", \"Krida-bhiramamu\", \"Panditaradhya-charitamu\", \"Sivayogasaramu\", \"Nitisara\", \"Niti-shastra-muktavali\", \"Nritta-ratnavali\", \"Pratapa-charita\", \"Siddheshvara-charitra\", \"Somadeva-rajiyamu\", \"Palnativira-charitra\", \"Velugotivari-vamsavali\", and \"Velugotivari-vamsacharitra\". Chronicles by Muslim authors such as Isami and Firishta describe Prataparudra's defeats against the Muslim armies. The Kannada text \"Kumara-Ramana-charita\" also provides information about Prataparudra's relations with the Kampili kingdom.\n\nBesides epigraphs and literature, the forts, temples and tanks constructed during the Kakatiya period are an important source of information about the contemporary society, art and architecture.\n\nThe Kakatiya rulers traced their ancestry to a legendary chief or ruler named Durjaya. Many other ruling dynasties of Andhra also claimed descent from Durjaya. Nothing further is known about this chief.\n\nMost of the Kakatiya records do not mention the varna (social class) of the family, but the majority of the ones that do, proudly describe them as Shudra. Examples include the Bothpur and Vaddamanu inscriptions of Ganapati's general Malyala Gunda \"senani\". The Kakatiyas also maintained marital relations with other Shudra families, such as the Kotas and the Natavadi chiefs. All these evidences indicate that the Kakatiyas were of Shudra origin.\n\nA few copper-plate inscriptions of the Kakatiya family describe them as belonging to the Kshatriya (warrior) varna. These inscriptions primarily document grants to brahmans, and appear to be inspired by the genealogies of the imperial Cholas. For example, the Motupalli inscription of Ganapati counts legendary solar dynasty kings such as Rama among the ancestors of Durjaya, the progenitor of the Kakatiya family. The Malkapuram inscription of Vishveshvara Shivacharya, the preceptor of Kakatiya rulers Ganapati-deva and Rudrama-devi, also connects the Kakatiyas to the solar dynasty (Sūryavaṃsa). The term \"Kshatriya\" in these panegyric records appears to signify the family's warrior-like qualities rather than their actual varna.\n\nThe regnal years of the early members of the Kakatiya family are not certain. Venna, said to have been born in the family of Durjaya, is the earliest known Kakatiya chief. The Bayyaram tank inscription names his successors as Gunda I, Gunda II, and Gunda III, comparing them to the three Ramas (Parashurama, Dasharatha-Rama, and Balarama). Gunda III was succeeded by Erra, who ruled Kurravadi and other regions. The inscription states that Erra's successor Gunda IV alias Pindi-Gunda ( 955-995) beheaded all his enemies. Gunda IV is also mentioned in the Mangallu grant of the Eastern Chalukya ruler Dānārnava in 956 CE.\n\nGunda IV was succeeded by Beta I ( 996-1051), who was succeeded by Prola I ( 1052-1076), called \"ari-gaja-kesari\" (\"lion to the elephant-like enemies\") in the Bayyaram inscription. The succeeding chiefs included Beta II (c. 1076–1108), Tribhuvanamalla Durgaraja (c. 1108–1116) and then Prola II (c. 1116–1157).\n\nThe early Kakatiya rulers used the title \"Reddi\" (derived from \"Redu,\" meaning king in Telugu). However, after they became sovereigns they were addressed as \"deva\" (Lord or deity) and \"devi\" (Lady or deity). There appears to be a significant element of \"sanskritisation\" in this transition.\n\nEarly members of Kakatiya family appear to have served as military generals of the Rashtrakutas, as indicated by a 956 inscription of the Vengi Chalukya prince Dānārnava. The inscription suggests that an attack by the Rashtrakuta king Krishna III forced the Vengi Chalukya king Amma II to flee his kingdom, after which Dānārnava (titled Vijayaditya) ruled the kingdom as a Rashtrakuta vassal. It records Dānārnava's grant of Mangallu village to a brahmana named Dommana, at the request of Kakatiya Gundyana. Dommana had performed a religious ceremony called \"Karpati-vrata\" for Gundyana, for which he received the village as an \"agrahara\". The inscription names Gundyana's ancestors as Gundiya-Rashtrakuta and Eriya-Rashtrakuta. This suggests that Gundyana was a Rashtrakuta general, and not a Vengi Chalukya subordinate, as assumed by some earlier historians.\n\nThe Bayyaram tank inscription, which records the construction of \"Dharma-kirti-samudra\" tank by Ganapati's sister Mailama (or Mailamba), provides another genealogical list. The similarities of names mentioned in the Mangallu and Bayyaram inscriptions lists suggest that both of these refer to the same family:\n\nHistorian P.V.P. Sastry theorizes that Betiya was the son of Eriya (alias Erra) and father of Gundyana (alias Pindi-Gunda), but may have become too insignificant to be mentioned by his descendants, because of a premature death or another reason.\n\nThe significance of the suffix \"Rashtrakuta\" in the names of the early Kakatiya chiefs is debated. According to one theory, the suffix implies that these chiefs were Rashtrakuta subordinates. This theory is based on the fact that the phrase \"Rashtrakuta-kutumbinah\" appears in several Rashtrakuta-era copper-plate inscriptions, and refers to the officers and subjects of the Rashtrakuta kingdom.\n\nAccording to another theory, the suffix implies that the Kakatiyas were a branch of the Rashtrakuta family, because the term \"Rashtrakuta-kutumbinah\" was used for officers employed by the Rashtrakuta administration, not feudatory chiefs: the early records of the Kakatiya chiefs describe them as \"samantas\" (feudatory chiefs). The Kazipet Darga inscription of Tribhuvanamalla Durgaraja states that the Kakatiya chief Beta was born in the family of Samanta Viṣṭi. Historian P.V.P. Sastry theorises that \"Viṣṭi\" is a corruption of Vrishni, the name of a clan from which some Rashtrakutas claimed descent. He notes that some chiefs of Rashtrakuta origin adopted the title \"Viṭṭi-narayana\", which means \"as great as Narayana (Krishna) of the Vitti (Vrishni) family. Sastry further proposes that the term \"Voddi\", which appears in the phrase \"Voddi-kula\" (\"Voddi family\") in the Mangallu inscription may be same as \"Viṣṭi\". Sastry also believes that the early Kakatiya chiefs followed Jainism, which was also patronized by the Rashtrakutas, thus strengthening the view that the two dynasties were connected (see Religion section below).\n\nThe Kakatiyas seemed to have adopted the mythical bird Garuda as their royal insignia, as attested by the Ekamranatha temple inscription of Ganapati-deva, the Palampet inscription of the Kakatiya general Recharla Rudra, and Vidyanatha's \"Prataparudriya\". The Bayyaram tank inscription calls the Kakatiya chief Beta I (son of Gunda IV) \"Garudamka\"-Beta, and \"Garuda\" here appears to refer to the family's emblem. In Hindu mythology, Garuda is the vahana of god Vishnu. The Rashtrakutas and some other dynsaties of Deccan claimed descent from the Vrishni clan (associated with Vishnu's avatar Krishna), and had adopted Garuda as their royal insignia. According to Sastry, this corroborates the theory that the Kakatiyas were associated with the Rashtrakuta family. Sastry further speculates that the Kakatiyas may have adopted the Garuda symbol because of Jain influence: the yaksha of the Jain tirthankara Shantinatha is represented by the Garuda symbol.\n\nBased on Ganapati-deva's Garavapadu inscription, which names Karikala Chola among the family's ancestors, epigraphist C.R.K. Charlu theorised that the Kakatiyas were a branch of the Telugu Cholas. However, no other Kakatiya record mentions Karikala, and unlike the Telugu Cholas, the Kakatiyas did not claim to belong to the Kashyapa-gotra. Therefore, Sastry dismisses Charlu's theory as untenable.\n\nAfter the decline of the Rashtrakuta power, the Kakatiyas served as vassals of the Kalyani Chalukyas. After the decline of the Chalukya power in the 12th century, they assumed sovereignty by suppressing other Chalukya subordinates in the Telangana region.\n\nThe 1149 Sanigaram inscription of Prola II is the last known record of the Kakatiyas as vassals. The 1163 Anumakonda inscription of Prataparudra I is the earliest known record that describes the Kakatiyas as a sovereign power.\n\nAccording to Sastry, Prataparudra I reigned between around 1158 – 1195, while Sircar gives the dates 1163–1195. He was also known as Rudra Deva, Kakatiya Rudradeva, Venkata, and Venkataraya He was the son of Prola II, who had made efforts to assert greater Kakatiya influence on territories in the western parts of the declining Western Chalukyan empire and who died in a battle fought against the Velanati Choda ruler Gonka II around 1157/1158 while doing so. It was during Prataparudra's reign, in 1163, that the Kakatiyas declared an end to their status as feudatory chiefs of the Chalukyas. It is notable that inscriptions were henceforth written using the Kakatiya chiefs' vernacular Telugu rather than the Kannada language that had prevailed until that point.\n\nMahadeva succeeded Prataparudra I as king, reigning probably from 1195 to 1199.\n\nJust as the Seuna and Hoysala dynasties took control of linguistically related areas during the 13th century, so too did the Kakatiyas under the rule of Ganapati. He is also known as Ganapathi Deva and, according to Sastry, reigned between 1199–1262; Sircar gives regnal dates of 1199–1260. He significantly expanded Kakatiya lands during the 1230s when he launched a series of attacks outside the dynasty's traditional Telangana region and thus brought under Kakatiya control the Telugu-speaking lowland delta areas around the Godavari and Krishna rivers. The outcome in the case of all three dynasties, says historian Richard Eaton, was that they \"catalysed processes of supralocal identity formation and community building\".\n\nThe Kakatiya capital at Orugallu, established in 1195, was not forgotten while Ganapati expanded his territory. He organised the building of a massive granite wall around the city, complete with ramps designed for ease of access to its ramparts from within. A moat and numerous bastions were also constructed.\n\nGanapati was keen to bolster the dynasty's economy. He encouraged merchants to trade abroad, abolishing all taxes except for a fixed duty and supporting those who risked their lives to travel afar. He created the man-made Pakhal Lake.\n\nRudrama Devi, also known as Rudramadevi, reigned around 1262–1289 CE (alternative dates: 1261–1295 CE) and is one of the few queens in Indian history. Sources disagree regarding whether she was the widow of Ganapati or his daughter.\n\nMarco Polo, who visited India probably some time around 1289–1293, made note of Rudrama Devi's rule and nature in flattering terms. She continued the planned fortification of the capital, raising the height of Ganapati's wall as well as adding a second earthen curtain wall in diameter and with an additional -wide moat.\n\nA fragmentary Kannada language inscription also states that the Kakatiya general Bhairava defeated the Yadava army probably in or after 1263 CE, which may be a reference to his repulsion of Mahadeva's invasion. A coin of Mahadeva bears the Kakatiya emblem varaha with the Yadava symbols; this varaha may have been stuck on Mahadeva's coins to mark the Kakatiya victory.\n\nRudrama was married to Virabhadra, an Eastern Chalukyan prince of Nidadavolu who had been selected for that purpose by her father. Having no son as an heir, Rudrama abdicated in favour of her grandson when it became apparent that the expansionist sultan Alauddin Khalji was encroaching on the Deccan and might in due course attack the Kakatiyas.\n\nThe earliest biography of Rudrama Devi's successor, Prataparudra II, is the \"Prataparudra Caritramu\", dating from the 16th century. His reign began in 1289 (alternative date: 1295) and ended with the demise of the dynasty in 1323. It is described by Eaton as the \"first chapter in a larger story\" that saw the style of polity in the Deccan change from being regional kingdoms to transregional sultanates that survived until the arrival of the British East India Company in the 18th century.\n\nThe Kakatiya kingdom attracted the attention of the Delhi Sultanate ruler Alauddin Khalji because of the possibility for plunder. The first foray into the Kakatiya kingdom was made in 1303 and was a disaster due to the resistance of the Kakatiya army in the battle at Upparapalli. In 1309 Alauddin sent his general, Malik Kafur, in an attempt to force Prataparudra into acceptance of a position subordinate to the sultanate at Delhi. Kafur organised a month-long siege of Orugallu that ended with success in February 1310. Prataparudra was forced to make various symbolic acts of obeisance designed to demonstrate his new position as a subordinate but, as was Alauddin's plan, he was not removed as ruler of the area but rather forced thereafter to pay annual tribute to Delhi. It was probably at this time that the Koh-i-Noor diamond passed from Kakatiya ownership to that of Alauddin, along with 20,000 horses and 100 elephants.\n\nIn 1311, Prataparudra formed a part of the sultanate forces that attacked the Pandyan empire in the south, and he took advantage of that situation to quell some of his vassals in Nellore who had seen his reduced status as an opportunity for independence. Later, though, in 1318, he failed to provide the annual tribute to Delhi, claiming that the potential for being attacked on the journey made it impossible. Alauddin's son Mubarak Shah responded by sending another of his generals, Khusrau Khan, to Orugallu with a force that bristled with technology previously unknown in the area, including trebuchet-like machines. Prataparudra had to submit once more, with his obeisance on this occasion being arranged by the sultanate to include a very public display whereby he bowed towards Delhi from the ramparts of Orugallu. The amount of his annual tribute was changed, becoming 100 elephants and 12,000 horses.\n\nThe new arrangements did not last long. Taking advantage of a revolution in Delhi that saw the Khalji dynasty removed and Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq installed as sultan, Prataparudra again asserted his independence in 1320. Tughlaq sent his son, Ulugh Khan, to defeat the defiant Kakatiya king in 1321. Khan's army was riven with internal dissension due to its containing factions from the Khalji and Tughluq camps. This caused the siege on this occasion to last much longer — six months, rather than the few weeks that had previously been the case. The attackers were initially repulsed and Khan's forces retreated to regroup in Devagiri. Prataparudra celebrated the apparent victory by opening up his grain stores for public feasting. Khan returned in 1323 with his revitalised and reinforced army and, with few supplies left, Prataparudra was forced into submission after a five-month siege. The unprepared and battle-weary army of Orugallu was finally defeated, and Orugallu was renamed as Sultanpur. It seems probable, from combining various contemporary and near-contemporary accounts, that Prataparudra committed suicide near to the Narmada River while being taken as a prisoner to Delhi.\n\nThe Kakatiya base was the city of Orugallu in the dry uplands of northern Telangana on the Deccan Plateau. From there they expanded their influence into Coastal Andhra, the delta between the Godavari and Krishna rivers that feed into the Bay of Bengal. According to Rao and Shulman, the latter contained a high proportion of Brahmins while the former was the haunt of \"peasants, artisans and warriors\". Under the Kakatiyas, cultural innovation often began in the uplands, was refined in the lowlands and then recycled back into the Deccan. This bi-directional flow of cultural influences brought into being a feeling of cultural affinity between those who spoke the Telugu language where nothing of that nature had previously existed. The unification of the distinct upland and lowland cultures was their most significant political achievement, achieved through a process of binding many locally powerful figures in allegiance to the empire.\n\nThe area of land under Kakatiya control reached its zenith around the 13th century CE during the rule of Ganapati Deva. By this time, South India and the Deccan was essentially under the aegis of four Hindu monarchies, of which the Kakatiyas were one. The four dynasties were in a constant state of warfare with each other, with the Kakatiyas eventually exercising control from close to Anagondi in the west to Kalyani in the north-east, and down to Kanei and Ganjam district in southern Orissa.\n\nA notable trend during the dynastic period was the construction of reservoirs for irrigation in the uplands, around 5000 of which were built by warrior families subordinate to the Kakatiyas. The dramatically altered the possibilities for development in the sparsely populated dry areas. Many of these edifices, often called \"tanks\", including the large examples at Pakala and Ramappa, are still used today.\n\nAnother notable architectural feature of the dynasty relates to temples. Even before the arrival of the dynasty, there were large, well-established and well-endowed Hindu places of worship in the relatively populous delta areas; however, the temples of the uplands, which were smaller and less cosmopolitan in origin and funding, did not exist until the Kakatiya period. In the lowlands, where Brahmins were numerous, the temples had long benefited from a desire to build social networks for the purposes of domestic and foreign trade, as well as for obtaining grazing rights in the face of competition; in the uplands, the endowment of the buildings was often associated with the construction and continued maintenance of reservoirs and enabled a different type of networking based on political hierarchies. The strengthening of those hierarchies, which was achieved in part by donating land for the temples and then attending worship, was necessary as the inland agrarian society grew rapidly in number and location.\n\nThere is a disparity between analysis of inscriptions, of which the work of Cynthia Talbot has been in the vanguard, and the traditional works of Vedic Hinduism that described pre-colonial India in terms of a reverent and static society that was subject to the strictures of the caste system. Colonial British administrators found much that appealed to them in the latter works but the Kakatiya inscriptions of Andhra Pradesh, which depict a far wider range of society and events, suggest that the reality was far more fluid and very different from the idealised image.\n\nCaste itself seems to have been of low importance as a social identifier. Even the Kakatiya kings, with one exception, considered themselves to be Shudras (in the ritual varna system). They were egalitarian in nature and promoted their subordinate warrior-chiefs who were similarly egalitarian and spurned the Kshatriya rank. Anyone, regardless of birth, could acquire the \"nayaka\" title to denote warrior status, and this they did. There is also little evidence that Kakatiya society paid much regard to caste identities, in the sense of \"jāti\". Although occupation does appear to have been an important designator of social position, the inscriptions suggest that people were not bound to an occupation by birth.\n\nThe population became more settled in geographic terms. The growth of an agricultural peasant class subsumed many tribal people who previously had been nomadic. The nexus of politics and military was a significant feature of the era, and the Kakatiya recruitment of peasants into the military did much to create a new warrior class, to develop social mobility and to extend the influence of the dynasty into areas of its kingdom that previously would have been untouched. The Kakatiya kings, and in particular the last two, encouraged an egalitarian ethos. The entrenched landed nobility that had existed prior to the dynasty found its power to be on the wane; the royal gifting of lands formerly in the possession of nobles to people of lesser status did much to effect this dilution.\n\nHistorian P.V.P. Sastry theorises that the early Kakatiya chiefs were followers of Jainism. A story in the \"Siddheshvara-charita\" states that Madhavavarman, an ancestor of the Kakatiyas, obtained military strength by the grace of goddess Padmakshi. The 1123 Govindapuram Jain inscription of Polavasa, another family of feudatory chiefs, contains a similar account of how their ancestor Madhavavarman obtained military strength by the grace of the Jain goddess Yaksheshvari.\n\nAccording to tradition, Prola II was initiated into Shaivism by the Kalamukha preceptor Rameshvara Pandita, and established Shaivism as his family's religion. The Shaivism-affiliated personal names of the later Kakatiya kings (such as Rudra, Mahadeva, Harihara, and Ganapati) also indicate a shift towards Shaivism. This, according to Sastry, strengthens the theory that the early Kakatiya chiefs were Jains.\n\nThe following members of the Kakatiya family are known from epigraphic evidence. The rulers are children of their predecessors, unless otherwise specified.\n\n\n\nTughlaq control of the area lasted only for around a decade. The fall of the Kakatiya dynasty resulted in both political and cultural disarray because of both disparate resistance to the sultanate and dissension within it. The structure of the Kakatiya polity disintegrated and their lands soon fell under the control of numerous families from communities such as the Reddies and Velamas. As early as 1330, Musunuri Nayaks who served as army chiefs for Kakatiya kingdom united the various Telugu clans and recovered Warangal from the Delhi Sultanate and ruled for half a century. Surrounded by more significant states, by the 15th century these new entities had ceded to the Bahamani Sultanate and the Sangama dynasty, the latter of which evolved to become the Vijayanagara empire.\n\nA brother of Prataparudra II, Annamaraja, has been associated with ruling what eventually became the princely state of Bastar during the British Raj period. This appears likely to be historical revisionism, dating from a genealogy published by the ruling family in 1703, because it records only eight generations spanning almost four centuries of rule. Such revisionism and tenuous claims of connection to the Kakatiyas was not uncommon because it was perceived as legitimising the right to rule and a warrior status. Talbot notes that there is a record of a brother called Annamadeva and that:\nAccording to Talbot and Eaton, a revisionist interpretation of Prataparudra II himself appeared much sooner, within a few years of his death, and for broadly similar reasons. A stone inscription dated 1330 mentions a Prolaya Nayaka, who was said to have restored order, as in Prataparudra days. He presented himself as a legitimate successor to Prataparudra, by portraying both of them as righteous monarchs, meanwhile reconstructing Prataparudra's life and career in a favorable way. By 1420, Muslim rulers had become accommodated to the Deccan society, and strong dichotomies between Hindus and Muslims were no longer useful. Muslim rulers were no longer conceived as diametrically opposed to the figure of Prataparudra, but rather as rulers of equal status.\n\nThis type of revisionism, which Talbot describes as \"social memories\" and which persist to the present day, reappeared in the 16th century with the \"Prataparudra Caritramu\" hagiography, which claimed him to be the founder of the \"padmanayaka\" class of Telugu warrior and provided the elite of the Vijayanagara empire with what Talbot has described as a \"charter of legitimacy\". This work claimed, contrary to all reasonable evidence, that he did not die after being taken prisoner but instead met with the sultan, was recognised as being an avatar of Shiva, and allowed to return to Orugallu. Once back home, the \"Prataparudra Caritamu\" says, he released the \"padmanayakas\" from their allegiance to him and told them to become independent kings. The work also claims Vijayanagara to be an ally of Prataparudra, which is clearly anachronistic but served the purpose of elevating the role of the \"padmanayakas\", whom it claimed to be ultimately subordinate to Vijayanagara during his time.\n\n\nFootnotes\nCitations\nBibliography\n"}

It is down the line from via and is situated between and . It is managed by Southern.\n\nTrains calling at Haywards Heath are operated by Southern and Thameslink. Until 2008 a small number of CrossCountry services also stopped here.\n\nThe London and Brighton Railway opened its main line from a junction with the London and Croydon Railway at Norwood as far as Haywards Heath on 12 July 1841, a coach service was provided to take passengers on the remainder of their journey towards Brighton. The remainder of the line to Brighton opened shortly after on 21 September of the same year. The original station was designed by the architect David Mocatta and included a central passing line, and an awning over the platform. The station retained its importance as a junction following the construction of the line to Lewes from Keymer to the south. From 1846 the railway became the London Brighton and South Coast Railway.\n\nOn 3 September 1883 the Lewes and East Grinstead Railway opened a branch line from Copyhold Junction, just north of the station, to Horsted Keynes railway station on their existing line between those towns. There was an intermediate station at Ardingly. As a result, Haywards Heath station was enlarged by the provision of two bay platforms. \nAs soon as the line was opened, the Lewes and East Grinstead Railway merged with the London Brighton and South Coast Railway, but until 1912, there was no physical connection between the tracks of the branch line and those of the main line; they ran parallel all the way to Haywards Heath station. Once the connection was made, it provided a relief route for the congested Brighton main line from Croydon to Brighton via Oxted, East Grinstead and Haywards Heath. This double-track branch line was closed to passengers on 28 October 1963, but a single-track section remains to serve a freight and aggregates terminal at Ardingly.\n\nHaywards Heath station was the site of the first use of the practice of \"slipping\" coaches from the rear of express trains, at intermediate junctions, for onward transmission to smaller stations. The earliest recorded example was in February 1858, when coaches for Hastings were slipped from a London Bridge to Brighton express. This practice was a regular feature at the station until the electrification of the line during 1932/3. The station and surrounding structures such as bridges were also totally rebuilt at this time. A single signal box, alongside Platform 4 (the westernmost platform face), replaced the former North and South boxes.\n\nIn 2014, work began on a new \"Station Quarter\", which would include construction of a new multi-storey car park and footbridge to service the platforms, a new Waitrose supermarket on site and a regeneration of the existing station buildings. The multi-storey car park was opened in late 2016 along with the new footbridge, while the new Waitrose supermarket was opened in March 2017.\n\nThe station lies on a quadruple-track passing loop (the line either side of the station is double-track), which allows fast services to overtake stopping services. As such, it has a total of four platforms, one per track, numbered 1 to 4.\n\nUnusually, the platforms have been numbered \"right-to-left\" (when facing London), instead of \"left-to-right\" which is the usual numbering scheme on the Brighton Main Line.\n\nPlatforms 1 and 4 are signalled bidirectionally, which allows trains to reverse here or run \"the wrong way\" through the station at times of disruption. Platforms 2 and 3 are partially signalled in both directions, allowing trains running to/from the south to reverse here.\n\nThere are three entrances/exits at the station. The main one is just off Commercial Square; access to platforms is in the form of a subway under the railway line. The other two entrances and exits use the new footbridge on the southern end of the platforms; one end of the footbridge leads onto Market Place and the other end connects with the station car park at Clair Road. All routes in and out of the station offer step-free access.\n\nThe typical Monday-Saturday service from the station is:\n\n\n\nTrains to and to (or ) run together between London and Haywards Heath, where they divide.\n\nOn Sundays the services to Cambridge do not run, while southbound services are reduced in frequency to 4tph to Brighton, 1tph to Littlehampton and 1tph to Ore. Sunday services to Ore and Littlehampton run separately and do not divide here.\n\nThe freight sidings at Haywards Heath were constructed during the First World War when the railway received a rapid growth in its freight traffic as a result of munitions trains travelling to Newhaven. They were intended to enable passenger trains to overtake slower freight traffic.\n\nToday a sidings track does remain from Old Wickham Lane Bridge, 700 meters north of the station to Folly Hill Tunnel entrance. This line is not often used anymore, however it is protected for future extension to the Bluebell Railway. An area imminently east of platform 1 is also protected for the potential terminus platform / station for the Bluebell if it does reach Haywards Heath. The new terminus would have a maximum of 1 platform, but would not be numbered platform 0.\n\nJust south of the station there is a 249-yard (228.6 m) tunnel through Folly Hill. There was an accident during the construction of this tunnel on 2 January 1841, causing a roof fall and killing three men, which prevented the railway from opening through to Brighton in the July. Until the 1970s this tunnel suffered from an excess of water falling from the ground above and in the 1840s it had to be lined with galvanised iron sheeting to prevent the water from falling on the third class passengers in open carriages.\n"}

After completing his education at Williamstown High School, Sigley's career began in 1952 as a turntable operator on Danny Webb's breakfast program at radio station 3DB (Melbourne). Television started in Australia in 1956, and Sigley made his TV debut as host of \"Teenage Mailbag\" on HSV-7 in 1957. Shortly after this, he travelled to London, gaining some work experience at the BBC. But a bigger break was to come with a three-year stint at Radio Luxembourg, where he performed under the name 'Ernie Williams'.\n\nSigley is remembered for his 1964 association with the Adelaide leg of The Beatles tour of Australia. In one press conference, Sigley's questioning of The Beatles brought about an enthusiastic response from John Lennon, which led to one of the best interviews of the tour.\n\nIn 1981 he returned to 3DB to host the breakfast program. Sigley was host of the afternoon program on Melbourne's 3AW from 1996 until his retirement on Friday 7 November 2008, when he took on a part-time role at the station. Sigley partnered either Bruce Mansfield or Philip Brady in the Friday night slot. Sigley ended his radio career in January 2009 after a 57-year association with the industry, when it is believed he stormed out of a heated meeting with 3AW management.\n\nHe was part of the original cast of \"Sunnyside Up\", and in the 1960s and early 1970s, Sigley hosted the prime time Adelaide variety show, Adelaide Tonight on NWS-9. Beginning in 1974, Sigley was the host of the national Nine Network variety show, \"The Ernie Sigley Show\", featuring notable Australian media personalities such as Denise Drysdale, Noni Hazlehurst, Pete Smith and Joy Westmore. The program was abruptly axed after an off-air outburst by Sigley, directed at station owner Kerry Packer and producer Peter Faiman, when the network cut short his first show for 1976 to accommodate a network sports awards telecast. Packer flew to Melbourne the next day and dismissed Sigley in person, effective immediately, and replaced him with Don Lane.\n\nAfter his dismissal in 1976, Sigley moved to ATV-0 and hosted the early evening variety show \"Ernie\" and then in 1978, \"the Penthouse\", which became \"Saturday Night Live\" on HSV-7 co-hosting with Mary Hardy.\n\nHe was the original host of the Australian version of the popular game show, \"Wheel of Fortune\", from 1981 to 1984.

Production of roses used to be the highest in Japan.\n\nThe waterfront area was formerly an industrial area and there were shipyards, iron works, and numerous canneries. Most of the heavy industry has been replaced by commercial venues.\n\nAt Shimizu Station, the \"Shimizu Ekimae Ginza\" shopping area used to be the city center of Shimizu. However, there are no longer any department stores. The Seiyu that remained near the station closed in March 2015. Since many large suburban shopping centers have been expanding, the shopping area downtown is not as lively as it used to be. Lately, department stores like Nagasaki-ya, Marui, Seifu and Daiei have closed, one after the another. Moreover, since Shimizu merged with Shizuoka, a plan is being implemented to move fundamental functions to the area around Higashi-Shizuoka Station as the third central area of the city in addition to Shimizu and Shizuoka.\n\n\n\nUntil 1984, the Shimizukō Line ran 8 km into Miho in the heart of the Shimizu peninsula. Local bus services provide many routes throughout Shimizu-ku.\n\n\nIt is well located, being in between the two major port areas of Japan, i.e. the Tokyo Bay ports of Tokyo, Kawasaki and Yokohama (Keihin ports) and the Osaka Bay ports of Osaka and Kobe (Hanshin ports. The Port of Shimizu has a water depth of about 12 meters; its attractiveness has been enhanced over the past years by the construction of new road and rail links which contribute to expanding its commercial hinterland.\n\nIn tonnage, imports (about 6.5 million tons) are close to twice export volumes, but in trade value exports are twice as valuable as imports.\n\nThe Port of Shimizu container traffic is about balanced, with over 250,000 TEU (Twenty Foot Equivalent Unit) in each direction, with auto parts and chemicals amongst the main cargo types. Major international container lines provide weekly services on major trade routes, including North America, Europe and Asia, with about 110 calls per months on 28 trade routes.\n\nThe port of Shimizu also includes a terminal to receive LNG tankers and store imported Liquefied natural gas; it is operated by Shimizu LNG, a subsidiary of Shizuoka Gas (Japan is the world's largest importer of LNG).\n\nThe Port of Shimizu is also connected to other Japan ports. In particular, it is served by a Roll-on/roll-off service serving the port of Ōita, on the north-east coast of the southern island of Kyushu. This service, which sails three times a week and has a transit time of 20 hours, has enabled a modal shift of freight trucks from road to sea, thereby contributing to decreasing congestion and pollution on roads.\n\nShimizu is famous as one of the top cities in Japan where football is quite popular. It is well known as the home town of a J.League team, Shimizu S-Pulse. An earlier club, \"Hagoromo Club\" (which spun off its parent company Nippon Light Metal) represented Shimizu in the old Japan Soccer League in the 1970s.\n\nThe local elementary schools and junior high schools equip fields with night lighting for soccer and Shimizu has maintained this infrastructure for a long time. Since 1987, the national soccer competition “Shimizu Cup” for boys and girls has been held in August.\n\nA famous son of the city is Japan youth international and Celtic footballer, Koki Mizuno.\n\n"}

This is a technique used in music, specifically in twelve-tone technique, where the inversion and retrograde techniques are performed on the same tone row successively, \"[t]he inversion of the prime series in reverse order from last pitch to first.\"\n\nConventionally, inversion is carried out first, and the inverted form is then taken backward to form the retrograde inversion, so that the untransposed retrograde inversion ends with the pitch that began the prime form of the series. In his late twelve-tone works, however, Igor Stravinsky preferred the opposite order, so that his row charts use inverse retrograde (IR) forms for his source sets, instead of retrograde inversions (RI), although he sometimes labeled them RI in his sketches.\n\nFor example, the forms of the row from \"Requiem Canticles\" are as follows:\nNote that IR is a transposition of RI, the pitch class between the last pitches of P and I above RI.\n\nOther compositions that include retrograde inversions in its rows include works by Tadeusz Baird and Karel Goeyvaerts. One work in particular by the latter composer, \"Nummer 2\", employs retrograde of the recurring twelve-tone row B–F–F–E–G–A–E–D–A–B–D–C in the piano part. It is performed in both styles, particularly in the outer sections of the piece. The final movement of Hindemith's Ludus Tonalis, the Postludium, is an exact retrograde inversion of the work's opening Praeludium.\n"}

In 1682, he became chief factor of the trading post of Fort Albany in James Bay, where he became rich. In 1697, he bought stock in the HBC; in 1711, he gained a seat on the board of directors. \n\nThe long wars of the Grand Alliance and the Spanish Succession between England and France had spread to North America and battered the Company financially and logistically. Four of the Company's five trading posts were lost to the French; Knight led an expedition in 1693 that successfully recaptured Fort Albany, the only one retained by the English. However, among the provisions of the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 was the restoration of the captured posts.\n\nIn 1714, Knight was sent out to take possession of York Factory and restore the Company's fortunes. \"Having served in a range of capacities in the Hudson’s Bay Company over the preceding 38 years, he was one of the most experienced fur traders ever to have taken charge of a company post.\" Despite the damage to the fort from the French occupation, and the hardships of the climate, he succeeded in rebuilding the Company's business, and in 1719, it paid its first dividend in 20 years.\n\nKnight was determined to find the Northwest Passage, a then-hypothetical route connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans through the Canadian North. A Chipewyan interpreter working for Knight told him of a possible mineral-rich route across the north. Knight outfitted two ships, the \"Albany\" and \"Discovery\"—captained by George Berley and David Vaughan respectively—to search for this route, and set off in 1719. They never returned.\n\nIn 1721, Knight and his crew were on Marble Island, located from today's Rankin Inlet. It is possible the ships encountered the shallows of the local waters and were wrecked, although they were able to successfully offload large quantities of coal, several cannons and provisions.\n\nThere is evidence of interaction with the local Inuit, but by 1722, Knight and his crew were reported to have perished from sickness and famine. Apparently, the Company post at Churchill was completely unaware of the shipwreck, as no search or rescue expedition was ever sent. On 20 November 1765, \"two Inuit boys informed the commander at Fort Churchill, Moses Norton, that their Elders had told them a story about two ships having been wrecked on Marble Island many years ago.\" The ruins of Knight's settlement on Marble Island were discovered in 1768, by Company explorer Samuel Hearne.\n\n"}

Johnson in 1957. Karl Malden took over directing duties for several days when Daves fell ill. The film stars Gary Cooper, Maria Schell, George C. Scott and Malden and is set in the gold fields of Montana during the gold rush of the 1860s and '70s. The story follows a doctor who saves a criminal from a lynch mob, then learns of the man's past and tries to manipulate him.\n\nThis marked the first film for Scott. He and Malden later teamed for 1970's \"Patton\", for which Scott won an Oscar.\n\nJoseph Frail (Gary Cooper)—doctor, gambler, gunslinger—rides into the small town of Skull Creek, Montana, with miners in a gold rush, looking to set up a doctor's office. He passes by the \"hanging tree,\" an old oak with a thick branch over which has been slung a rope with a frayed end, presumably a former noose.\n\nHe rescues and treats Rune (Ben Piazza), a young man who was shot by \"Frenchy\" (Karl Malden) while trying to steal gold from a sluice. Frail forces Rune into temporary servitude with the threat of revealing he is the thief.\n\nA stagecoach is robbed and overturned, killing the driver and a male passenger. A search party is formed, and Frenchy finds the sole survivor, Swiss immigrant Elizabeth Mahler (Maria Schell), daughter of the male passenger.\n\nCrippled by burns, blindness and dehydration, Elizabeth is moved into a house next to the doctor's house to recover. The placement causes much chagrin among the town's righteous women, who believe that Elizabeth may be paying for her medical care through illicit behavior.\n\nFrenchy sneaks in under the guise of trying to strike a business deal with Elizabeth, but instead tries to kiss her. Frail witnesses the aggression and chases Frenchy back to town. Frail beats him up and threatens to kill him. Meanwhile, a faith healer named Dr. Grubb (George C. Scott) sees Frail's medical practice as a threat.\n\nElizabeth eventually regains her sight and makes romantic overtures toward Frail. He rejects her. She leaves in a huff, determined to strike it rich as a prospector so that she can pay off Frail and get out from under his control.\n\nShe teams up with Rune and Frenchy, who plan to buy a claim and set up a sluice. To get money, she pawns a family heirloom necklace. It is worthless, but Frail secretly tells the storekeeper to loan her however much money she needs. Thus Frail secretly continues to control her.\n\nShe finds out and asks Frail why he did not respond to her affection. He reveals that his wife had an affair with his own brother. He found them together, both dead, an apparent murder-suicide. In a rage, he burned down his house with their bodies in it. He tells Elizabeth he is \"not allowed to forget.\"\n\nElizabeth, Frenchy and Rune strike it rich on their claim, finding a \"glory hole\" of gold under a large tree stump. They ride into town, tossing a few pieces of gold to the townsfolk. Frenchy, overwhelmed by his sudden importance in the town, uses some of the gold to buy whiskey for everyone. The gaiety quickly turns into a riot of the lawless town members led by Dr. Grubb. While the lawful citizens of the town are engaged in fighting fires set by Grubb, Frenchy takes advantage of the commotion to make advances on Elizabeth. Her disinterest sparks a brutal physical assault as he attempts to rape her. Frail again catches Frenchy just in time. A fistfight ensues. Frenchy pulls his pistol and shoots, but misses. Frail kills Frenchy.\n\nSeeing his opportunity to remove his \"competition\", Grubb incites the mob to lynch Frail. They carry him to the hanging tree, tie his hands, and stand him up in a wagon bed, the rope around his neck. Rune and Elizabeth rush in carrying their gold and the deed to their claim. Elizabeth offers everything to the townsfolk if they will let Frail live. As the mob turns on itself in the struggle to grab the gold and the deed, the lynch party disperses.\n\nElizabeth now feels she has finally repaid Frail in full. Rune slips the noose off, and Elizabeth turns to walk away. Frail calls out her name. She turns back, and steps to the end of the wagon. He kneels down, cups her chin with both hands, and they touch foreheads, while a ballad plays in the background.\n\n\nThe film was the first one for Cooper's Baroda Productions company. It was also the first film produced by former talent agents Martin Jurow and Richard Shepherd.\n\nPrincipal photography was shot on location in the Oak Creek Wildlife Area, in the mountains west of Yakima, Washington. The scenes during the opening credits and title, where Gary Cooper rides alongside the river on horseback with a pack horse in tow, were filmed about mid-June in 1958, just northeast of Goose Prairie, Washington, along the north bank of the Bumping River. The fictional small gold mining town of Skull Creek was a temporary film set constructed along the south side of Little Rattlesnake Creek by its confluence with Rattlesnake Creek, just southwest of Nile, Washington.\n\nWith the direction of Ted McCord, A.S.C., Directory of Photography for \"The Hanging Tree\", made use of full-aperture photography and reduction printing to improve the grain quality of the film. This process involves widening the aperture of the camera to capture a larger image, then reducing the image back to standard size in post-production. While this achieves the greatest effect jumping from larger formats like 65mm film, Ted McCord used 35mm film and extended to aperture to the sprocket holes on the film. When shooting a subject from 100 feet, this extended the width of the shot from 42 feet to 48 feet.\n\nMarty Robbins performed the title song that was nominated for best song at the 32nd Annual Academy Awards and the 1960 Golden Laurel Award for Best Song. The lyrics contain a short reference to the film's story. It was also released on the reissue of the album \"Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs\" (1959) by Marty Robbins, who performed this song in the opening credits of this film. A known cover-version is by Frankie Laine who performed this song at the 32nd Academy Awards.\n\nThe film's score was composed by Max Steiner.\n\n\nThe film was received well by audiences and critics at its 1959 debut. \"Film Bulletin\" drew a parallel between the \"glory hole\" of gold Elizabeth and Rune discover and the profits of the film. The well-rounded casting, beautiful landscapes, and Marty Robbins title song all contributed to the film's success.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1804375", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1804375", "title": "Khalwati order", "text": "Khalwati order\n\nThe Khalwati order (also known as Khalwatiyya, Khalwatiya, or Halveti, as it is known in Turkey) is an Islamic Sufi brotherhood (\"tariqa\"). Along with the Naqshbandi, Qadiri and Shadhili orders, it is among the most famous Sufi orders. The order takes its name from the Arabic word \"khalwa\", meaning “method of withdrawal or isolation from the world for mystical purposes.”\n\nThe order was founded by Umar al-Khalwati in the city of Herat in medieval Khorasan (now located in western Afghanistan). However, it was Umar's disciple, Yahya Shirvani, who founded the “Khalwati Way.” Yahya Shirvani wrote Wird al-Sattar, a devotional text read by the members of nearly all the branches of Khalwatiyya.\n\nThe Khalwati order is known for its strict ritual training of its \"dervishes\" and its emphasis of individualism. Particularly, the order promoted individual asceticism (\"zuhd\") and retreat (\"khalwa\"), differentiating themselves from other orders at the time. The order is associated as one of the source schools of many other Sufi orders.\n\nThere were two major historical movements of the Khalwati order. The first one started in the late 14th century and ended in the 17th century. The first historical movement marks its origins and spread in vast area, now being part of Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey. The second movement began in the late 15th century to the mid-19th century mostly focused in Egypt, considered the reform period of the Khalwati order. The order lost popularity in 1865, but many of its leaders branched off to form different orders to expand Islam throughout Africa. The order resided mostly in large urban areas.\n\n Al-Hasan Al-Basri is known as pir of the pirs which by all the 12 tariqa orders have their silsilas from. He also added that Umar al-Khalwati is a shaykh that died in seclusion after being in it for 40 days. He continued to point out that all the other orders have their silsila from Khalwati. Because in order to achieve self-fulfilment a murid or dervish need to practice Khalwa. Then we have the others that attribute Umar al-Khalwati as its founder, or the \"first \"pir\"\". However, Umar- Khalwati was considered a mysterious man who did very little to spread the order. Shaykh Yahya Shirvani was considered \"the second pir\" that was responsible for the spread of the Khalwati order. Yahya Shirvani lived during a time of great political instability in the wake of the Mongol invasion. After the Mongol invasions, Turkish nomads began to gather into urban centers of the Islamic world. All these cities had Sufi \"shaykhs\" performing miracles for the nomads. Thus, these Turkish nomads were easily converted to mystical Islam when the Sufi \"shaykhs\" promised them union with Allah. Yahya Shirvani entered Baku at this time of religious fervor and political instability, and he was able to start a movement. Yahya Shirvani was able to gather ten thousand people to his movement. Yahya had many popular, charismatic disciples to spread the order, including Pir Ilyas.\n\nThe time of greatest popularity for Khalwati order was during the thirty-year reign of “Sufi Bayazid II” (1481–1511) in Ottoman Turkey. During this time, the sultan practiced Sufi rituals, which, without a doubt, brought in many people to the order who wanted to advance their political career. This is the time period where members of the upper class, Ottoman military, and higher ranks of civil services were all involved with the Khalwati order. The Sufi sheikh, Chelebi Khalifa, moved the headquarters of the Khalwati order from Amasya to Istanbul. Here, they rebuilt a former church into a \"tekke\", or Sufi lodge. The tekke became known as the Koca Mustafa Pasha Mosque. These buildings spread throughout the region as Khalwati's popularity grew. The order spread from its origins in the Middle East to the Balkans (especially in southern Greece, Kosovo and North Macedonia, to Egypt, Sudan and almost all corners of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nAfter Chelebi Khalifa’s death, the power was passed to his son-in-law, Sunbul Efendi. He was considered a very spiritual man that saved the Koca Mustafa Pasha Mosque. According to the miraculous account, the new sultan Selim I, was suspicious of the Khalwati order and wanted to destroy its \"tekke\". Selim I sent workers to tear down the \"tekke\", but an angry Sunbul Efendi turned them away. Hearing this, Selim I went down there himself only to see hundreds of silent dervishes gathered around Shaykh Sunbul dressed with his \"khirqa\". Selim was astonished by Sunbul’s spiritual power and canceled the plans to destroy the \"tekke\".\n\nThe attacks from the ulama, the orthodox religious class, were more serious in the long run. Their hostility were on many Sufi orders, not just the Khalwatiya. Their criticism was a political concern, which suggested that they Khalwatis were disloyal to the Ottoman state, and a doctrinal concern, that the Sufis were thought by the ulama to be too close to folk Islam and too far from the shari'a. The ulama also held a cultural hostility towards them, which made the ulama intolerant of the Sufis.\n\nThe order began to transform itself over the course of the 16th and 17th centuries as it became more embedded in Ottoman social and religious life. A good example of this is the branch of the order founded by Sha`ban-i Veli (d. 1569) in Kastamonu. Whereas Sha`ban was a retiring ascetic who kept a low profile in the 16th century, by the 17th century his spiritual follower `Omer el-Fu'adi (d. 1636) wrote multiple books and treatises that sought to cement the order's doctrines and practices, in addition to combatting a growing anti-Sufi feeling that later took shape in the form of the Kadizadeli movement. Also during this period, the order sought to reassert its Sunni identity, by disassociating itself with the Shi’i enemy. With the reign of Sulayman the Magnificent and Selim II the order entered a revival. They had links with many high-ranking officials in the Ottoman administration and received substantial donations in cash and property, which helped to recruit more members.\n\nBy this time, members of the Khalwati order broke ties with the common people, who they previously aligned themselves so closely. They attempted to rid the order of folk Islam to a more orthodox order. The Khalwati was very conscious of their public image and wanted the order to become more of an exclusive membership for the upper class. From here, the Khalwati order broke off into many suborders. In 1650s rose one of the most famous Anatolian Khalwati shaykhs, Niyazi al-Misri. Niyazi was famous for his poetry, his spiritual powers, and public opposition to the government. He was a leader that represented the old Khalwati order, one for the masses. Niyazi gave the common people and their spiritual aspirations a voice again in the Khalwati order. Niyazi's poetry demonstrates some of the Khalwati's aspects of retreat. He writes in one of his poems:\n\nMost scholars believe that the Khalwati went through a revival during the 18th century when Mustafa ibn Kamal ad-Din al-Bakri (1688-1748) was in charge. Al-Bakri was considered a great shaykh who wrote many books, invented Sufi techniques, and was very charismatic. He travelled throughout Jerusalem, Aleppo, Istanbul, Baghdad, and Basra. Before he died he wrote 220 books, mostly about \"adab\". It is said that he saw the prophet nineteen times and al-Khidr three times. In many cities, people would mob al-Bakri to receive his blessing. After al-Bakri died, Khalwati dome scholars believe that al-Bakri set “a great Sufi renaissance in motion.” He was considered the reformer who renewed the Khalwati order in the Egypt. The Khalwati order still remains strong in Egypt where the Sufi orders do receive a degree of support from the government. The Khalwati order also remains strong in the Sudan.\n\nHowever, not all scholars agree with al-Bakri’s influence. Frederick de Jong argues in his collected studies that al Bakri’s influence was limited. He argues that many scholars speak of his influence, but without much detail about what he actually did. Jong argues that al-Bakri’s influence was limited to adding a prayer litany to the Khalwati rituals. He made his disciples read this litany before sunrise and called it the Wird al-sahar. Al-Bakri wrote this prayer litany himself and thought it necessary to add it to the practices of the Khalwati order. Jong argues al-Bakri should not be attributed with the revival of the Sufi order for his limited effect.\n\nMembers of the Khwalti order were involved in political movements by playing a huge role in the Urabi insurrection in Egypt. The order helped others oppose British occupation in Egypt. The Khalwati groups in Upper Egypt protested British occupation due to high taxes and unpaid labor, which, in addition to drought, made living very hard in the 1870s. Their protests blended with the large stream nationalist protests that lead up to the Urabi insurrection. It can be said that the Khalwati’s fight to improve living conditions eventually lead to the larger nationalist protests.\nThe situation varies from region to region. In 1945, the government in Albania recognized the principal tariqas as independent religious communities, but this came to an end after the Albanian Cultural Revolution in 1967. In 1939 there were twenty-five Khalwatiyya tekkes in Albania, Macedonia and Kosovo. In 1925 the orders were abolished in Turkey and all tekkes and zawiyas were closed and their possessions confiscated by the government, and there is no data available on the status of the Khalwatiyya. In Egypt there are still many active branches of the Khalwatiyya.\n\nModernity has affected the orders to have quite different forms in different environments. They vary depending on the locality, personality of the shaykh and the needs of the community. There may also be different prayer practices, patterns of association, and the nature of relations linking the disciples to the shaykh and to each other.\n\nThe Khalwati order had many tekkes in Istanbul, the most famous being the Jerrahi, Ussaki, Sunbuli, Ramazani and Nasuhi. Although the Sufi orders are now abolished in the Republic of Turkey, the above are almost all now mosques and/or places of visitation by Muslims for prayer.\n\n\nThe hallmark of the Khalwatiyya tariqa, way, and its numerous subdivisions is its periodic retreat (khalwa) that is required of every novice. These can last between three days to forty days. The khalwa for some offshoots of the Khalwatiyya is essential in preparing the pupil, murid. The collective dhikr follows similar rules throughout the different branches of the Khalwatiyya order. The practice of dhikr is described as repetitive prayer. The practitioner is to be repeating Allah's name and remembering Allah. The dervish is to be attentive to Allah in their repetitive prayer. They are to be completely focused on Allah, so much so that an early Sufi master says \"True dhikr is that you forget your dhikr.\" Another practice that distinguishes the Khalwatiyya from other tariqas is that for them it is through participation in the communal rites and rituals that one reaches a more advanced stage of awareness, one that the theorists of the order described as a face-to-face encounter with Allah.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Murray often announced the frequency as 104.9 MHz, the relevant frequency in Sydney. The show ended at the end of 2007, although in 2009 it was reinstated on Triple M in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.\n\nThe 2006-2007 show almost always ended with the song \"Watermelon Man\" and included:\n\nThis climactic competition every evening followed the common radio-quiz format in which callers call in and the first contestant answers as many questions as they can before the compere passes to the next caller. There were five questions so the winner was the person who answered the fifth question correctly.\n\nWhen an inadequate number of callers rang in, Mashup (music) of The Doors' \"Riders on the Storm\" and Blondie (band)'s \"Rapture\" was played as punishment music until enough contestants called.\n\nThe quiz was normally run in the last 5 minutes of the show. Hints were given to ensure that the quiz finished on time. These got as simple as \"just say <answer to question>\".\n\nInitially, the prize was \"absolutely nothing\" but eventually it became the chance to hear the song \"Watermelon Man\", which was often the answer to the fifth and last question.\n\nMurray's parodies of Sydney personalities include:\n\nMurray is married and lives in Sydney. He is a lifelong Wests Tigers supporter and a Holden fan. He is an atheist.\n\nMurray and his wife Sian's 1-day-old son, Leo, died in August 2012 due to complications from a premature birth.\n\n"}

{"id": "1804413", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1804413", "title": "Shadhili", "text": "Shadhili\n\nThe Shadhili Tariqa () is a Sufi order of Sunni Islam founded by Abul Hasan Ali ash-Shadhili of Morocco in the 13th century. Followers (Arabic \"murids\", \"seekers\") of the Shadhiliya are known as Shadhilis.\n\nIt has historically been of importance and influence in North Africa and Egypt with many contributions to Islamic literature. Among the figures most known for their literary and intellectual contributions are Ibn 'Ata Allah, author of the \"Hikam\", and Ahmad Zarruq, author of numerous commentaries and works, and Ahmad ibn Ajiba who also wrote numerous commentaries and works. In poetry expressing love of Muhammad, there have been the notable contributions of Muhammad al-Jazuli, author of the \"Dala'il al-Khayrat\", and Busiri, author of the famous poem, the Qaṣīda al-Burda. Many of the head lecturers of al-Azhar University in Cairo have also been followers of this tariqa.\n\nOf the various branches of the Shadhili tariqa are the Fassiyatush, found largely in India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. The Darqawi branch is found mostly in Morocco and the Darqawi Alawiyya \"(no connection to the \"Kızılbaş-Turkish-Alevis\" or \"Syrian-Arab-Alawis\")\" which originated in Algeria is now found the world over, particularly in Syria, Jordan, France and among many English-speaking communities. British scholar, Martin Lings wrote an extensive biography of the founder of this branch, Ahmad al-Alawi, entitled 'A Sufi Saint of the 20th century'.\n\nThe anniversary of Qutub Al Akbar Imam Abul Hasan Ali ash-Shadhili is held on 12th of Shawwal (the tenth month of lunar calendar) at Humaithara in Egypt.\n\nShadhiliyya has nearly 72 branches across the globe. A few prominent branches are listed below.\n\nFassiyatush shadhili Sufi order was established by Qutbul Ujud Ghouthuz Zamaan Ash Sheikh Muhammad bin Muhammad bin Mas'ood bin Abdur Rahman Al Makki Al Magribi Al Fassi Ash Shadhili (Imam Fassi) who was a Moroccan by origin and born in Makkah. Fassiyatush Shadhiliyya is widely practised in India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Mauritius and Indonesia. The descendants of Imam Fassi who are Sheikhs of Fassiyatush Shadhiliyya who live in Makkah and in Jeddah visit to these countries frequently to train Ikhwan. The international leader of Fassiya ash Shadhiliyya (Sheikhus Sujjadah) is selected from the heirs of Qutbul Ujood and Najmul Ulema Sheikh Ajwad bin Abdallah al Fassi al Makki ash Shadhili is the present leader of the international Sufi order al Fassiya ash Shazuliya.\n\nThe Darqawiyya, a Moroccan branch of the Shadhili order, was founded in the late 18th century CE by Muhammad al-Arabi al-Darqawi. Selections from the Letters of al-Darqawi have been translated by the Shadhili initiate Titus Burckhardt, and also by the scholar Aisha Bewley. One of the first tariqas to be established in the West was the 'Alawiya branch of the Darqawiyya, which was named after Ahmad ibn Mustafa al-'Alawi al-Mustaghanimi, popularly known as Shaykh al-Alawi. \"A significant book about him, written by Martin Lings, is \"A Sufi Saint of the Twentieth Century\".\"\n\nThe 'Attasiyah Order is a branch of the 'Alawi Order, founded by Umar bin Abdur Rahman bin Aqil al-Attas. It is centered in Yemen but also has centers in Pakistan, India, and Myanmar. The 'Alawiya order in Yemen has recently been studied by the anthropologist David Buchman. In his article \"The Underground Friends of God and Their Adversaries: A Case Study and Survey of Sufism in Contemporary Yemen\", Professor Buchman summarizes the results of his six-month period of fieldwork in Yemen. The article was originally published in the journal \"Yemen Update\"\n\nAnother figure is Sheikh Abdal Qadir al-Murabit, a Scottish convert to Islam, whose lineage is Shadhili-Darqawi. Currently his order is known as the Murabitun. At other times his order has been known as the Darqawiyya and Habibiya. One of the first books that Abdal Qadir wrote was \"The Book of Strangers\", which he authored under the name Ian Dallas.\n\nAnother contemporary order deriving, in part, from Abdal Qadir al-Murabit is the al-Haydariyah al-Shadhiliyah, headed by Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri. Of Shi'ite descent, Fadhlalla teaches within neither a Shi'i nor a Sunni framework.\n\nThe Darqawi-Alawi branch of the Shadili tariqa also established itself in Damascus and the Levant through Sheikh Muhammad al-Hashimi al-Tilmisani, the son of an Algerian qadi, who migrated to Damascus along with his spiritual guide Ibn Yallis. After the death of Ibn Yallis, Hashimi was authorized by Sheikh Ahmad al-'Alawi (see above Martin Lings), during a visit to Damascus in the early 1920s, and was made his deputy in Damascus. A biography of his life was published in English as \"Shaykh Muhammad al-Hashimi: His Life and Works\".\n\nThe most well known living spiritual guide of this branch of the Shadhili tariqa, especially to English-speakers, is Sheikh Nuh Ha Mim Keller, an American scholar, author, and translator, who resides in Amman, Jordan. He was authorized by Sheikh Abd al Rahman Al Shaghouri, who was himself a student of Sheikh Muhammad al-Hashimi al-Tilmisani and the lead singer of his gatherings in Damascus. Advocating a holistic and erudite approach to Sufism, Nuh Keller and his students have played an instrumental role in broadening access to Islamic sciences through online education and high quality publications and translations of classical works. His tariqa is notable in attracting a large number of scholars, academics, and professionals.\n\nSheikh Muhammad Sa'id al-Jamal, another student of Sheikh Muhammad al-Hashimi al-Tilmisani and who died in 2015, had worked from the Haram al-Sharif or The Temple Mount in Jerusalem and was a mufti of the Hanbali Madhab. He was also a student of the spiritual guide and Shadhili Sheikh Abdur Rahman Abu al Risah of Halab of the Shadhili Yashruti line. He was a direct descendant of Muhammad, through his ancestor Ahmad ar-Rifa`i. He wrote many books in both English and Arabic on Sufism, tafsir, and healing. His students from the US also established the University of Spiritual Healing and Sufism which is devoted to the Sufi way of healing.\n\nAnother branch of the Shadhilia which has groups in Egypt, Indonesia, Turkey and America is the Shadhilia-Batawia founded by Sheikh Ibrahim al-Batawi, for many years professor at al-Azhar. He was a confrere of Sheikh Abdu-l-Halim Mahmud, Shaikh al-Azhar, who was very influential in the revival of Sufism in Egypt. Sheikh Ibrahim's student, Sheikh Abdullah Nooruddeen Durkee has established the Shadhdhuliyyah-Baddawia order in the US. Sheikh Nooruddeen has translated and transliterated the Qur'an and has compiled two definitive books on the Shadhdhuliyyiah, Orisons and Origins.\n\n\"Between October 17–26, 1999 the First International Shadhilian Festival occurred in Egypt. It concluded with a pilgrimage to the tomb of Abu 'l-Hasan al-Shadhili and involved Sufi gatherings of dhikr\" and the singing of qasidas, or classical poetry.\n\nThe Maryamiyya Order was founded by Swiss-German metaphysician Frithjof Schuon, author of \"The Transcendent Unity of Religions\", among other influential books, as an outgrowth of the Alawiyya order (of which he was initiated into by René Guénon). In 1946, the students of a group he led in Switzerland declared him to be an \"independent master\", spurring him to create his own order. Sometime in 1965, Nūr al-Dīn began having visions of Maryam (as the Virgin Mary is known in Islam), who the Order is named after. The Maryamiyya Order is particularly notable for being largely formed around Perennial philosophy and Neoplatonism, and heavily influenced by Advaita Vedanta and Guénon's Traditionalist School.\n\nIt has been suggested that the Shadhili school was influential on St. John of the Cross, in particular on his account of the dark night of the soul and via Ibn Abbad al-Rundi.\n\nThis influence has been suggested by Miguel Asín Palacios and developed by others, who claim that Ibn Abbad al-Rundi drew detailed connections between their teachings.\n\nOther scholars, such as José Nieto, argue that these mystical doctrines are quite general, and that while similarities exist between the works of St. John and Ibn Abbad and other Shadhilis, these reflect independent development, not influence.\n\nEvery tariqa must have a chain of transmission and authorization to be recognized as valid. All the chains start from Ali ibn Abitalib and goes as 2 branches one through his son Imam Hasan ibn Ali Ibn Abitalib and another through Hasan Basri. The chain through Imam Hasan ibn Ali is referred as golden chain and the other through Hasan al Basri is referred as silver chain. Shadhiliyya is golden chain by its origin.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1804416", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1804416", "title": "Tuscan dialect", "text": "Tuscan dialect\n\nTuscan ( ; ) is a set of Italo-Dalmatian varieties of Romance mainly spoken in Tuscany, Italy.\n\nStandard Italian is based on Tuscan, specifically on its Florentine dialect, and it became the language of culture throughout Italy due to the prestige of the works by Dante Alighieri, Petrarch, Giovanni Boccaccio, Niccolò Machiavelli, and Francesco Guicciardini. It would later become the official language of all the Italian states and of the Kingdom of Italy when it was formed.\n\nIn \"De vulgari eloquentia\" ( 1300), Dante Alighieri distinguishes four main subdialects: \"fiorentino\" (Florence), \"senese\" (Siena), \"lucchese\" (Lucca) and \"aretino\" (Arezzo).\n\nTuscan is a dialect complex composed of many local variants, with minor differences among them.\n\nThe main subdivisions are between Northern Tuscan dialects, the Southern Tuscan dialects, and Corsican.\n\nThe Northern Tuscan dialects are (from east to west):\n\nThe Southern Tuscan dialects are (from east to west):\n\nCorsican on the island of Corsica and the Corso-Sardinian transitional varieties spoken in northern Sardinia (Gallurese and Sassarese) are classified by scholars as a direct offshoot from medieval Tuscan, even though they now constitute a distinct linguistic group.\n\nExcluding the inhabitants of Province of Massa and Carrara, who speak an Emilian variety of a Gallo-Italic language, around 3,500,000 people speak the Tuscan dialect.\n\nThe Tuscan dialect as a whole has certain defining features, with subdialects that are distinguished by minor details.\n\nThe Tuscan gorgia affects the voiceless stop consonants and . They are often pronounced as fricatives in post-vocalic position when not blocked by the competing phenomenon of syntactic gemination:\n\nA phonetic phenomenon is the intervocalic weakening of the Italian \"soft g\", the voiced affricate (\"g\" as in judge\") and \"soft c\", the voiceless affricate (\"ch\" as in church\"), known as \"attenuation\", or, more commonly, as deaffrication.\n\nBetween vowels, the \"voiced post-alveolar affricate\" consonant is realized as \"voiced post-alveolar fricative\" (\"z\" of azure):\n\nThis phenomenon is very evident in daily speech (common also in Umbria and elsewhere in Central Italy): the phrase \"la gente\", 'the people', in standard Italian is pronounced , but in Tuscan it is .\n\nSimilarly, the \"voiceless post-alveolar affricate\" is pronounced as a \"voiceless post-alveolar fricative\" between two vowels:\n\nThe sequence \"la cena\", 'the dinner', in standard Italian is pronounced , but in Tuscan it is . As a result of this weakening rule, there are a few minimal pairs distinguished only by length of the voiceless fricative (e.g. \"lacerò\" 'it/he/she ripped' vs. \"lascerò\" 'I will leave/let').\n\nA less common phonetic phenomenon is the realization of \"voiceless s\" (voiceless alveolar fricative ) as the voiceless alveolar affricate when preceded by , , or .\n\nFor example, \"il sole\" (the sun), pronounced in standard Italian as , would be in theory pronounced by a Tuscan speaker . However, since assimilation of the final consonant of the article to the following consonant tends to occur in exactly such cases (see \"Masculine definite articles\" below) the actual pronunciation will be usually . Affrication of can more commonly be heard word-internally, as in \"falso\" (false) → . This is a common phenomenon in Central Italy, but it is not exclusive to that area; for example it also happens in Switzerland (Canton Ticino).\n\nThere are two Tuscan historical outcomes of Latin \"ŏ\" in stressed open syllables. Passing first through a stage , the vowel then develops as a diphthong . This phenomenon never gained universal acceptance, however, so that while forms with the diphthong came to be accepted as standard Italian (e.g. \"fuoco\", \"buono\", \"nuovo\"), the monophthong remains in popular speech (\"foco\", \"bono\", \"novo\").\n\nA characteristic of Tuscan dialect is the use of the accusative pronoun \"te\" in emphatic clauses of the type \"You! What are you doing here?\".\n\nA morphological phenomenon, cited also by Alessandro Manzoni in his masterpiece \"\"I promessi sposi\"\" (The Betrothed), is the doubling of the dative pronoun.\n\nFor the use of a personal pronoun as \"indirect object\" (\"to someone, to something\"), also called \"dative case\", the standard Italian makes use of a construction \"preposition + pronoun\" a me (to me), or it makes use of a synthetic pronoun form, mi (to me). The Tuscan dialect makes use of both in the same sentence as a kind of intensification of the dative/indirect object:\n\nThis usage is widespread throughout the central regions of Italy, not only in Tuscany, and is often considered redundant and erroneous by language purists.\n\nIn some dialects the double accusative pronoun \"me mi vedi\" (lit: \"You see me me\") can be heard, but it is considered an archaic form.\n\nThe singular and plural masculine definite articles can both be realized phonetically as in Florentine varieties of Tuscan, but are distinguished by their phonological effect on following consonants. The singular provokes lengthening of the following consonant: 'the dog', whereas the plural permits consonant weakening: 'the dogs'. As in Italian, masc. sing. \"lo\" occurs before consonants long by nature or not permitting in clusters is normal (\"lo zio\" 'the uncle', \"lo studente\" 'the student'), although forms such as \"i zio\" can be heard in rustic varieties.\n\nA morpholosyntactic phenomenon found throughout Tuscany is the personal use of the particle identical to impersonal si (not to be confused with \"passive si\" or the \"reflexive si\"), as the first person plural. It is basically the same as the use of \"on\" in French.\n\nIt's possible to use the construction si + Third person in singular, which can be preceded by the first plural person pronoun noi. \n\nThe phenomenon is found in all verb tenses, including compound tenses. In these tenses, the use of \"si\" requires a form of essere (\"to be\") as auxiliary verb. If the verb is one that otherwise selects auxiliary avere in compound constructions, the past participle does not agree with the subject in gender and number:\nIf the verb normally requires \"essere\", the past participle is marked as plural:\n\nUsually \"si\" contracts before è: \"si è → s'è\".\n\nAnother morphological phenomenon in the Tuscan dialect is what might appear to be shortening of first singular verb forms in the present tense of fare (\"to do\", \"to make\") and andare (\"to go\").\n\nThese forms have two origins. Natural phonological change alone can account for loss of and reduction of to in the case of > * > . A case such as Latin: \"sapio\" > Italian so (I know), however, admits no such phonological account: the expected outcome of would be *, with a normal lengthening of the consonant preceding yod.\n\nWhat seems to have taken place is a realignment of the paradigm in accordance with the statistically minor but highly frequent paradigms of \"dare\" (give) and \"stare\" (be, stay). Thus \"so, sai, sa, sanno\" (all singulars and 3rd personal plural of 'know') come to fit the template of \"do, dai, dà, danno\" ('give'), \"sto, stai, sta, stanno\" ('be, stay'), and \"fo, fai, fa, fanno\" ('make, do') follows the same pattern. The form vo, while quite possibly a natural phonological development, seems to have been reinforced by analogy in this case.\n\nA phonological phenomenon that might appear to be a morphological one is the loss of the infinitival ending -re of verbs.\n\nStress remains on the same vowel that is stressed in the full form, so that the infinitive can come to coincide with various conjugated singulars: \"pèrde\" 'to lose', \"pèrde\" 's/he loses'; \"finì\" 'to finish', \"finì\" 's/he finished'. This homophony seldom, if ever, causes confusion, as they usually appear in distinct syntactic contexts. \n\nWhile the infinitive without \"-re\" is universal in some subtypes such as Pisano-Livornese, in the vicinity of Florence alternations are regular, so that the full infinitive (e.g. \"vedere\" 'to see') appears when followed by a pause, and the clipped form (\"vedé\") is found when phrase internal. The consonant of enclitics is lengthened if preceded by stressed vowel (\"vedéllo\" 'to see it', \"portàcci\" 'to bring us'), but not when the preceding vowel of the infinitive is unstressed (\"lèggelo\" 'to read it', \"pèrdeti\" 'to lose you').\n\nA similar process is found in Catalan and its dialects. Final infinitive -r is not pronounced, so \"anar\" is realised as /ə'na/.\n\nThe biggest differences among dialects is in the lexicon, which also distinguishes the different subdialects.\nThe Tuscan lexicon is almost entirely shared with standard Italian, but many words may be perceived as obsolete or literary by non-Tuscans. There are a number of strictly regional words and expressions too.\n\nCharacteristically Tuscan words:\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is one of the largest companies of the industry in the Central and Eastern European region and has operations in over 40 countries.\n\nThe company sells products for gynecology, the central nervous system, and cardiology areas among other therapeutic areas. The company was established in Budapest by Gedeon Richter, a pharmacist, in 1901. The establishment of his firm marked the beginning of the development of the Hungarian pharmaceutical industry.\n\nGedeon Richter plc has a primary listing on the Budapest Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the BUX Index. It had a market capitalisation of approximately $6,6 billion as of 2018, the third largest of companies with a primary listing on the Budapest Stock Exchange. It has secondary listings on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.\n\nIn 1901, the pharmacist Gedeon Richter founded the company, when he first received a license to industrially produce medicines.\n\nInitially, small-scale pharmaceutical production took place in the Arany Sas (Golden Eagle) Pharmacy, which still operates today. At the time pharmaceutical production on an industrial scale required heavy investments, and large-scale pharmaceutical manufacturing activities were considered to be extremely capital-intensive operations. Initially, the laboratory processed extracts from organs of animals and produced organotherapeutic drugs.\n\nThe plant was built in 1907 in the Kőbánya suburb of Budapest and was Hungary´s first pharmaceutical manufacturing plant and regarded as an outstanding technological achievement in its day. In compliance with the established international trends of the pharmaceutical industry in those days, the company produced herbal drugs, processed extracts from plants and manufactured synthetic products at a later date. The company became a highly recognized manufacturer of lecithin products, antiseptic and febrifuge products, as well as painkillers (Hyperol, Kalmopyrin, and Tonogen, which continue to be in use). In 1934, Constant Janssen, of the future Janssen Pharmaceuticals, acquired the distribution rights for Gedeon Richter's products.\n\nIn the 1970s, chemists at the Gedeon Richter Chemical Works in Budapest discovered the brain enhancing drug Vinpocetine.\n\nIn 1995 Gedeon Richter signed a manufacturing contract with Danco for marketing an abortion pill in France. In 1997 the company made the decision to breach of contract by pulling out the production on U.S. market. Thus, on May 9, 1997 the New Yorker Supreme Court accused the company by Danco Laboratories Ltd., because they lost over $200 million by the abortion pill project.\n\nIn May 2006 Gedeon Richter signed a development and supply agreement with the US-based company Repros Therapeutics to produce Proellex. In July 2007 Gedeon Richter signed a contract with Barr Pharma for the production of Novartis Lamisil. Barr paid Gedeon Richter a royalty for distributing the product in the U.S.\n\nFrom July 2008 - April 2012, the company constructed a new manufacturing facility ($110 million) in Debrecen.\n\nIn October 2010, Gedeon Richter acquired 100% of a private Swiss biopharmaceutical company, PregLem, for CHF 445 million (€337 million). PregLem is focused on the treatment of gynecological conditions and infertility.\n\nIn 2015, Stada Arzneimittel AG and Gedeon Richter signed a license and distribution agreement to commercialize Richter’s biosimilar Pegfilgrastim in Europe.

While the greater part of the village lies within County Fermanagh, part of it crosses the border and the River Erne into County Donegal. It lies in the historic barony of Lurg. It had a population of 904 people in the 2011 Census, and is situated within Fermanagh and Omagh district.\n\nBelleek is a busy market town with a variety of pubs, shops, restaurants and a hotel. It is noted for the fine parian china produced there at the Belleek Pottery, the oldest pottery in Ireland. The china is valued by collectors from all over the world. It is also a noted location for angling and other recreational activities and is now linked to the River Shannon by canal.\n\nThe highest temperature in Northern Ireland recorded by the Met Office, , occurred at Knockarevan (near Belleek) in County Fermanagh on 30 June 1976.\n\nThe village is the most westerly settlement in Northern Ireland and thus the most westerly settlement in the United Kingdom. The majority \nof the pottery is still produced in Belleek today using the same procedures of over 160 years.\n\nThere is evidence of Neolithic settlers in the area, and later legend has it that Fionn mac Cumhail's men sharpened their swords on the big limestone rock at Belleek Falls. (The flagstone, which gave its name to the area, was destroyed together with the falls during drainage works in the 1880s).\n\nA castle was built at \"Caol Uisce\" near Belleek at the entrance to Lower Lough Erne by Gilbert Costello in 1212. Belleek town in its present layout was founded on the Blennerhassett estate during the Plantation of Ulster in the early 17th century.\n\nThe establishment of the pottery in 1857 saw the start of growth and the town developed further with the founding of a cooperative creamery in 1899, a police station, a courthouse, post office and dispensary.\n\nLocated on the border, there were a number of incidents in Belleek during the Troubles – which resulted in eight fatalities between 1972 and 1992.\n\nThe renowned Belleek Pottery in the centre of the village is currently owned by US-based Dundalk man, George Moore. It was founded in 1857 by John Caldwell Bloomfield, who declared that any piece with the slightest flaw would be destroyed and this is still the case today. The first examples of this fine Parian china were made using kaolin and feldspar deposits found in the lands surrounding Castle Caldwell. With the establishment of the pottery, new houses were built for workers in Rathmore Terrace and in Hawthorn Terrace. There is a visitor's centre at the pottery.\n\nA stained glass window featuring a potter's hands is located above the altar in St. Patrick's Roman Catholic church. This was built in 1903 at a cost of £2000. Three stained glass windows were also unveiled in Belleek Church of Ireland in May 2009 to commemorate the founders of Belleek Pottery, John Caldwell Bloomfield, the local landowner, Robert Williams Armstrong, architect, ceramics expert and first manager of Belleek Pottery and David McBirney, Dublin who provided the finance for the project. All were members of the Church of Ireland.\n\nCastle Caldwell Forest Walk lies four miles outside Belleek at the western end of Lower Lough Erne. Castle Caldwell was originally built in 1612. Lower Lough Erne is home to various protected wildlife, including inland Sandwich tern, curlew, lapwing, redshank, and snipe colonies.

Bornological spaces were first studied by Mackey. The name was coined by Bourbaki after , the French word for \"bounded\".\n\nA bornology on a set \"X\" is a collection \"B\" of subsets of \"X\" such that\nElements of the collection \"B\" are usually called bounded sets. The pair (\"X\", \"B\") is called a bornological set.\n\nA base of the bornology \"B\" is a subset \"B\" of \"B\" such that each element of \"B\" is a subset of an element of \"B\".\n\n\nIf \"B\" and \"B\" are two bornologies over the spaces \"X\" and \"Y\", respectively, and if \"f : X → Y\" is a function, then we say that \"f\" is a bounded map if it maps \"B\"-bounded sets in \"X\" to \"B\"-bounded sets in \"Y\". If in addition \"f\" is a bijection and formula_6 is also bounded then we say that \"f\" is a bornological isomorphism.\n\nExamples:\n\nTheorems:\n\nIf \"X\" is a vector space over a field \"K\" then a vector bornology on \"X\" is a bornology \"B\" on \"X\" that is stable under vector addition, scalar multiplication, and the formation of balanced hulls (i.e. if the sum of two bounded sets is bounded, etc.). If in addition \"B\" is stable under the formation of convex hulls (i.e. the convex hull of a bounded set is bounded) then \"B\" is called a convex vector bornology. And if the only bounded subspace of \"X\" is the trivial subspace (i.e. the space consisting only of formula_8) then it is called separated. A subset \"A\" of \"X\" is called bornivorous if it absorbs every bounded set. In a vector bornology, \"A\" is bornivorous if it absorbs every bounded balanced set and in a convex vector bornology \"A\" is bornivorous if it absorbs every bounded disk.\n\nEvery topological vector space \"X\", at least on a non discrete valued field gives a bornology on \"X\" by defining a subset \"B ⊆ X\" to be bounded (or von-Neumann bounded), if and only if for all open sets \"U ⊆ X\" containing zero there exists a \"r > 0\" with \"B ⊆ r U\". If \"X\" is a locally convex topological vector space then \"B ⊆ X\" is bounded if and only if all continuous semi-norms on \"X\" are bounded on \"B\".\n\nThe set of all bounded subsets of \"X\" is called the bornology or the Von-Neumann bornology of \"X\".\n\nSuppose that we start with a vector space \"X\" and convex vector bornology \"B\" on \"X\". If we let \"T\" denote the collection of all sets that are convex, balanced, and bornivorous then \"T\" forms neighborhood basis at 0 for a locally convex topology on \"X\" that is compatible with the vector space structure of \"X\".\n\nIn functional analysis, a bornological space is a locally convex topological vector space whose topology can be recovered from its bornology in a natural way. Explicitly, a Hausdorff locally convex space \"X\" with topology formula_9 and continuous dual formula_10 is called a bornological space if any one of the following equivalent conditions holds:\nwhere a subset \"A\" of \"X\" is called sequentially open if every sequence converging to \"0\" eventually belongs to \"A\".\n\nThe following topological vector spaces are all bornological:\n\n\nSuppose that \"X\" is a topological vector space. Then we say that a subset \"D\" of \"X\" is a disk if it is convex and balanced. The disk \"D\" is absorbing in the space \"span(D)\" and so its Minkowski functional forms a seminorm on this space, which is denoted by formula_20 or by \"p\". When we give \"span(D)\" the topology induced by this seminorm, we denote the resulting topological vector space by formula_21. A basis of neighborhoods of \"0\" of this space consists of all sets of the form \"r D\" where \"r\" ranges over all positive real numbers. If \"D\" is von Neuman bounded in \"X\" then the (normed) topology of \"X\" will be finer than the subspace topology that \"X\" induces on this set.\n\nThis space is not necessarily Hausdorff as is the case, for instance, if we let formula_22 and \"D\" be the \"x\"-axis. However, if \"D\" is a bounded disk and if \"X\" is Hausdorff, then formula_20 is a norm and \"X\" is a normed space. If \"D\" is a bounded sequentially complete disk and \"X\" is Hausdorff, then the space \"X\" is a Banach space. A bounded disk in \"X\" for which \"X\" is a Banach space is called a Banach disk, infracomplete, or a bounded completant.\n\nSuppose that \"X\" is a locally convex Hausdorff space. If \"D\" is a bounded Banach disk in \"X\" and \"T\" is a barrel in \"X\" then \"T\" absorbs \"D\" (i.e. there is a number \"r > 0\" such that \"D ⊆ r T\").\n\n\nA disk in a topological vector space \"X\" is called infrabornivorous if it absorbs all Banach disks. If \"X\" is locally convex and Hausdorff, then a disk is infrabornivorous if and only if it absorbs all compact disks. A locally convex space is called ultrabornological if any of the following conditions hold:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1804463", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1804463", "title": "Pericyte", "text": "Pericyte\n\nPericytes (previously known as Rouget cells) are multi-functional mural cells of the microcirculation that wrap around the endothelial cells that line the capillaries and venules throughout the body. Pericytes are embedded in basement membrane, where they communicate with endothelial cells of the body's smallest blood vessels by means of both direct physical contact and paracrine signaling. Pericytes help to maintain homeostatic and hemostatic functions in the brain and also sustain the blood–brain barrier. These cells are also a key component of the \"neurovascular unit\", which includes endothelial cells, astrocytes, and neurons. Pericytes regulate capillary blood flow, the clearance and phagocytosis of cellular debris, and the permeability of the blood–brain barrier. Pericytes stabilize and monitor the maturation of endothelial cells by means of direct communication between the cell membrane as well as through paracrine signaling. A deficiency of pericytes in the central nervous system can cause the blood–brain barrier to break down.\n\nIn the central nervous system, pericytes wrap around the endothelial cells that line the inside of the capillary. These two types of cells can be easily distinguished from one another based on the presence of the prominent round nucleus of the pericyte compared to the flat elongated nucleus of the endothelial cells. Pericytes also project finger-like extensions that wrap around the capillary wall, allowing the cells to regulate capillary blood flow.\n\nBoth pericytes and endothelial cells share a basement membrane where a variety of intercellular connections are made. Many types of integrin molecules facilitate communication between pericytes and endothelial cells separated by the basement membrane. Pericytes can also form direct connections with neighboring cells by forming peg and socket arrangements in which parts of the cells interlock, similar to the gears of a clock. At these interlocking sites, gap junctions can be formed, which allow the pericytes and neighboring cells to exchange ions and other small molecules. Important molecules in these intercellular connections include N-cadherin, fibronectin, connexin and various integrins.\n\nIn some regions of the basement membrane, adhesion plaques composed of fibronectin can be found. These plaques facilitate the connection of the basement membrane to the cytoskeletal structure composed of actin, and the plasma membrane of the pericytes and endothelial cells.\n\nPericytes in the skeletal striated muscle are of two distinct populations, each with its own role. The first pericyte subtype (Type-1) can differentiate into fat cells while the other (Type-2) into muscle cells. Type-1 characterized by negative expression for nestin (PDGFRβ+CD146+Nes-) and type-2 characterized by positive expression for nestin (PDGFRβ+CD146+Nes+). While both types are able to proliferate in response to glycerol or BaCl2-induced injury, type-1 pericytes give rise to adipogenic cells only in response to glycerol injection and type-2 become myogenic in response to both types of injury. The extent to which type-1 pericytes participate in fat accumulation is not known.\n\nPericytes are also associated with endothelial cell differentiation and multiplication, angiogenesis, survival of apoptotic signals and travel. Certain pericytes, known as microvascular pericytes, develop around the walls of capillaries and help to serve this function. Microvascular pericytes may not be contractile cells, as they lack alpha-actin isoforms, structures that are common amongst other contractile cells. These cells communicate with endothelial cells via gap junctions, and in turn cause endothelial cells to proliferate or be selectively inhibited. If this process did not occur, hyperplasia and abnormal vascular morphogenesis could result. These types of pericyte can also phagocytose exogenous proteins. This suggests that the cell type might have been derived from microglia.\n\nA lineage relationship to other cell types has been proposed, including smooth muscle cells, neural cells, NG2 glia, muscle fibers, adipocytes, as well as fibroblasts and other mesenchymal stem cells. However, whether these cells differentiate into each other is an outstanding question in the field. Pericytes' regenerative capacity is affected by aging. Such versatility is useful, as they actively remodel blood vessels throughout the body and can thereby blend homogeneously with the local tissue environment.\n\nAside from creating and remodeling blood vessels, pericytes have been found to protect endothelial cells from death via apoptosis or cytotoxic elements. It has been shown \"in vivo\" that pericytes release a hormone known as pericytic aminopeptidase N/pAPN that may help to promote angiogenesis. When this hormone was mixed with cerebral endothelial cells as well as astrocytes, the pericytes grouped into structures that resembled capillaries. Furthermore, when the experimental group contained all of the following with the exception of pericytes, the endothelial cells would undergo apoptosis. It was thus concluded that pericytes must be present to ensure the proper function of endothelial cells, and astrocytes must be present to ensure that both remain in contact. If not, then proper angiogenesis cannot occur. It has also been found that pericytes contribute to the survival of endothelial cells,as they secrete the protein Bcl-w during cellular crosstalk. Bcl-w is an instrumental protein in the pathway that enforces VEGF-A expression and discourages apoptosis. Although there is some speculation as to why VEGF is directly responsible for preventing apoptosis, it is believed to be responsible for modulating apoptotic signal transduction pathways and inhibiting activation of apoptosis-inducing enzymes. Two biochemical mechanisms utilized by VEGF to accomplish this would be phosphorylation of extracellular regulatory kinase 1 (ERK-1), which sustains cell survival over time, and inhibition of stress-activated protein kinase/c-jun-NH2 kinase, which also promotes apoptosis.\n\nPericytes play a crucial role in the formation and functionality of the blood–brain barrier. This barrier is composed of endothelial cells and ensures the protection and functionality of the brain and central nervous system. It has been found that pericytes are crucial to the postnatal formation of this barrier. Pericytes are responsible for tight junction formation and vesicle trafficking amongst endothelial cells. Furthermore, they allow the formation of the blood–brain barrier by inhibiting the effects of CNS immune cells (which can damage the formation of the barrier) and by reducing the expression of molecules that increase vascular permeability.\n\nAside from blood–brain barrier formation, pericytes also play an active role in its functionality by controlling the flow within blood vessels and between blood vessels and the brain. In animal models with lower pericyte coverage, trafficking of molecules across endothelial cells occurs at a higher frequency, allowing proteins into the brain that would normally be excluded. Loss or dysfunction of pericytes is also theorized to contribute to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and ALS through breakdown of the blood-brain barrier.\n\nIncreasing evidence suggests that pericytes can regulate blood flow at the capillary level. For the retina, movies have been published showing that pericytes constrict capillaries when their membrane potential is altered to cause calcium influx, and in the brain it has been reported that neuronal activity increases local blood flow by inducing pericytes to dilate capillaries before upstream arteriole dilation occurs. This area is controversial, with a recent study claiming that pericytes do not express contractile proteins and are not capable of contraction in vivo, although the latter paper has been criticised for using a highly unconventional definition of pericyte which explicitly excludes contractile pericytes. It appears that different signaling pathways regulate the constriction of capillaries by pericytes and of arterioles by smooth muscle cells.\n\nPericytes are important in maintaining circulation. In a study involving adult pericyte-deficient mice, cerebral blood flow was diminished with concurrent vascular regression due to loss of both endothelia and pericytes. Significantly greater hypoxia was reported in the hippocampus of pericyte-deficient mice as well as inflammation, and learning and memory impairment.\n\nBecause of their crucial role in maintaining and regulating endothelial cell structure and blood flow, abnormalities in pericyte function are seen in many pathologies. They may either be present in excess, leading to diseases such as hypertension and tumor formation, or in deficiency, leading to neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nThe clinical phases of hemangioma have physiological differences, correlated with immunophenotypic profiles by Takahashi et al. During the early proliferative phase (0–12 months) the tumors express proliferating cell nuclear antigen (pericytesna), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and type IV collagenase, the former two localized to both endothelium and pericytes, and the last to endothelium. The vascular markers CD31, von Willebrand factor (vWF), and smooth muscle actin (pericyte marker) are present during the proliferating and involuting phases, but are lost after the lesion is fully involuted.\n\nHemangiopericytoma is a rare vascular neoplasm, or abnormal growth, that may either be benign or malignant. In its malignant form, metastasis to the lungs, liver, brain, and extremities may occur. It most commonly manifests itself in the femur and proximal tibia as a bone sarcoma, and is usually found in older individuals, though cases have been found in children. Hemangiopericytoma is caused by the excessive layering of sheets of pericytes around improperly formed blood vessels. Diagnosis of this tumor is difficult because of the inability to distinguish pericytes from other types of cells using light microscopy. Treatment may involve surgical removal and radiation therapy, depending on the level of bone penetration and stage in the tumor's development.\n\nThe retina of diabetic individuals often exhibits loss of pericytes, and this loss is a characteristic factor of the early stages of diabetic retinopathy. Studies have found that pericytes are essential in diabetic individuals to protect the endothelial cells of retinal capillaries. With the loss of pericytes, microaneurysms form in the capillaries. In response, the retina either increases its vascular permeability, leading to swelling of the eye through a macular edema, or forms new vessels that permeate into the vitreous membrane of the eye. The end result is reduction or loss of vision. While it is unclear why pericytes are lost in diabetic patients, one hypothesis is that toxic sorbitol and advanced glycation end-products (AGE) accumulate in the pericytes. Because of the build-up of glucose, the polyol pathway increases its flux, and intracellular sorbitol and fructose accumulate. This leads to osmotic imbalance, which results in cellular damage. The presence of high glucose levels also leads to the buildup of AGE's, which also damage cells.\n\nStudies have found that pericyte loss in the adult and aging brain leads to the disruption of proper cerebral perfusion and maintenance of the blood–brain barrier, which causes neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. The apoptosis of pericytes in the aging brain may be the result of a failure in communication between growth factors and receptors on pericytes. Platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGFB) is released from endothelial cells in brain vasculature and binds to the receptor PDGFRB on pericytes, initiating their proliferation and investment in the vasculature.\n\nImmunohistochemical studies of human tissue from Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis show pericyte loss and breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. Pericyte-deficient mouse models (which lack genes encoding steps in the PDGFB:PDGFRB signalling cascade) and have an Alzheimer's-causing mutation have exacerbated Alzheimer's-like pathology compared to mice with normal pericyte coverage and an Alzheimer's-causing mutation.\n\nIn conditions of stroke, pericytes constrict brain capillaries and then die, which may lead to a long-lasting decrease of blood flow and loss of blood–brain barrier function, increasing the death of nerve cells.\n\nEndothelial cells and pericytes are interdependent and failure of proper communication between the two cell types can lead to numerous human pathologies.\n\nThere are several pathways of communication between the endothelial cells and pericytes. The first is transforming growth factor (TGF) signaling, which is mediated by endothelial cells. This is important for pericyte differentiation. Angiopoietin 1 and Tie-2 signaling is essential for maturation and stabilization of endothelial cells. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) pathway signaling from endothelial cells recruits pericytes, so that pericytes can migrate to developing blood vessels. If this pathway is blocked, it leads to pericyte deficiency. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling also aids in pericyte recruitment by communication through G protein-coupled receptors. S1P sends signals through GTPases that promote N-cadherin trafficking to endothelial membranes. This trafficking strengthens endothelial contacts with pericytes.\n\nCommunication between endothelial cells and pericytes is vital. Inhibiting the PDGF pathway leads to pericyte deficiency. This causes endothelial hyperplasia, abnormal junctions, and diabetic retinopathy. A lack of pericytes also causes an upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), leading to vascular leakage and hemorrhage. Angiopoietin 2 can act as an antagonist to Tie-2, destabilizing the endothelial cells, which results in less endothelial cell and pericyte interaction. This occasionally leads to the formation of tumors. Similar to the inhibition of the PDGF pathway, angiopoietin 2 reduces levels of pericytes, leading to diabetic retinopathy.\n\nUsually, astrocytes are associated with the scarring process in the central nervous system, forming glial scars. It has been proposed that a subtype of pericytes participates in this scarring in a glial-independent manner. Through lineage tracking studies, these subtype of pericytes were followed after stroke, revealing that they contribute to the glial scar by differentiating into myofibroblasts and depositing extracellular matrix. However, this remains controversial, as more recent studies suggest that the cell type followed in these scar studies is likely to be not pericytes, but fibroblasts.\n\nThe emerging evidence (as of 2019) suggests that neural microvascular pericytes, under instruction from resident glial cells, are reprogrammed into interneurons and enrich local neuronal microcircuits. This response is amplified by concomitant angiogenesis.\n\n\n"}

It was a bicameral Parliament, with an Upper House having a power of veto over the Commons.\n\nAfter the death of Oliver Cromwell his son Richard Cromwell succeeded him as Lord Protector of the Protectorate on 3 September 1658. As a civilian, Richard did not have the full confidence of the Army, particularly as the administration had a perennial budget deficit of half a million pounds and the Army was owed nearly nine hundred thousand pounds in back pay. His only option was to call a Parliament in the hope that it would cement his position by general recognition of the ruling class and by raising new taxes to pay the arrears owed to the Army.\n\nThe Third Protectorate Parliament was summoned on 9 December 1658 on the basis of the old franchise, and assembled on 27 January 1659. Richard was recognised as Lord Protector by the Parliament by 223 votes to 134, but over the next month the old divisions re-surfaced. The \"Commonwealthsmen\" and members of the Rump Parliament (such as Sir Henry Vane, Edmund Ludlow and Sir Arthur Haselrig) wanted to dismantle the Protectorate and return to the Commonwealth which had existed between the regicide of Charles I in January 1649 and the dismissal of the Rump Parliament by Oliver Cromwell in 1653.\n\nThe Protectorate faction was led by the Secretary of State John Thurloe, General John Lambert and Major-Generals Charles Fleetwood and Sir John Desborough. These members wished to keep the Protectorate but were divided over who should command the Army and be Lord Protector. \n\n\"The proposition of restoring the Parliament met with great opposition from many of those that had tasted the sweetness of power and profit under the late usurpation of the Cromewells, and who feared a more equal distribution of things; and therefore they everywhere affirmed that there was not a sufficient number of members left to make up a Parliament\".\n\nAn informal committee of key generals and republican parliamentary members met at Henry Vane the Younger's home at Charing-Cross; representing the army were John Lambert, Col John Hones, Col. Kelsey, Col. Berry, and representing Parliament were Sir Henry Vane, Sir Arthur Haslerig, Major Saloway and Edmund Ludlow.\n\n\"The things demanded by those of the army were: 1. To be secured by an act of indemnity for what was past; 2. That some provision of power might be made for Mr. Richard Cromwell, as well as for the payment of his debts, and future subsistence in a plentiful manner, they having promised to take care of him in these particulars; 3. That what should stand in need of regulation both in the law and clergy, should be reformed and amended; 4. That the government of the nation should be by a representative of the people, and by a select senate (chosen in part by the military faction)\". Difficulties arose from mistrust between Parliament and the army, making effective working between the two houses problematic. \n\nThe issues came to a head when Parliament attempted to impeach Major-General William Boteler for actions he had carried out during the Rule of the Major-Generals in 1656. In response to the attempted impeachment, on 6 April 1659 the Grandees in the Army presented Parliament with a declaration calling for soldiers to be granted immunity from prosecution for all actions carried out during Oliver Cromwell's Protectorate. But accepting that the Commonwealthsmen were in the ascendency in Parliament, Desborough and Fleetwood forced a reluctant Richard Cromwell to use his powers as Lord Protector to dissolve Parliament on 22 April 1659.\n\nThe Grandees intended to keep Richard Cromwell as Lord Protector under Army control, without calling another parliament. Their position was undermined, however, when it became clear that the Army's rank and file still harboured support for the \"Good Old Cause\" of the Commonwealth, and still wanted to have their arrears of pay settled. This groundswell of support forced the Grandees to allow Richard Cromwell to re-call the Rump Parliament less than a month after the dissolution of the Third Protectorate Parliament.\n\nThere were two Speakers during the Third Protectorate Parliament and two Deputy Speakers. Chaloner Chute served as Speaker from 27 January 1659 until 14 April 1659, with two deputy speakers: Sir Lislebone Long from 9 March 1659 until 14 March 1659, and Thomas Bampfield from 16 March 1659 until 14 April 1659. Thomas Bampfield was Speaker from 15 April 1659 until 22 April 1659.\n\nThe Third Protectorate Parliament was preceded by the Second Protectorate Parliament and followed by the return of the Rump Parliament.\n\nThe constituencies and distribution of seats, in England and Wales, for this Parliament reverted to being the same as in the Long Parliament. However the Scottish and Irish constituencies (see list in the First Protectorate Parliament article) remained unchanged.\n\nAbbreviations: Boro' const. – Borough/Burgh constituencies, Shire const. – County/Shire constituencies, Univ. const. or const'ies – University constituencies, Total Const. – Total constituencies, Con.

He was chosen by the members of the diplomatic mission to Joseon in 1423.\n\nShūbun is considered to be the founder of the Chinese style of \"suiboku\" ink painting in Japan. He was influenced by Chinese landscape painters Xia Gui and Ma Yuan.\n\nThroughout his life, Shūbun was associated with the Zen Buddhist temple, Shōkoku-ji. Early in his career, he studied painting there under Josetsu, a Chinese immigrant who became the father of the new Japanese ink painting tradition. Under Josetsu's influence, Shūbun started studying Chinese Song Dynasty painting by masters such as Xia Gui and Ma Yuan; consequently, Shūbun's style was an intermediate step between early Japanese artists who imitated Chinese models very closely, and later artists, who developed a national style. Later in life, Shūbun became overseer of buildings and grounds at Shōkoku-ji.\n\nIn the 1440s he taught the young Sesshū Tōyō, who became his best pupil and the most highly regarded Japanese artist of his time. Another important pupil may have been Kanō Masanobu, who succeeded Shūbun as the chief painter of the Ashikaga shogunate, and also founded the Kanō school of painting.\n\nShūbun's most well-known painting, designated as a National Treasure in Japan, is \"Reading in a Bamboo Grove\", now kept in the Tokyo National Museum.

The starfish is native to the coasts of northern China, North Korea, South Korea, Russia and Japan and distribution of this species into other countries has increased. It is on the Invasive Species Specialist Group list of the world's 100 worst invasive species.\n\nIn the UK spawning occurs from July to October at temperatures of 10°C to 12°C. Fertilized eggs develop into free-swimming larvae that live in the water for around 90 days before settling and metamorphosing into juvenile seastars. In one year the northern Pacific seastar is capable of increasing its diameter by 8 cm; when fully grown the northern Pacific seastar lives up to five years, and can reach sizes up to 40 to 50 cm in diameter. Larval survival is constrained by temperature and salinity of the surrounding marine habitat, with the optimal ranges respectively 8°C to 16°C, and 3‰ to 8.75‰. Generally, seastars are sensitive to salinity fluctuations, and are unlikely to be found in places of high salinity. In Japan its numbers increase and reach outbreak proportions for two to three years; outbreaks have been found to occur in three or ten year cycles.\nNative to the coasts of northern China, Korea, Russia and Japan, the northern Pacific seastar lives in waters between 71 °C and 22 °C. It lives in mainly shallow water, but also is found as deep as 200 metres. It is rarely found on reefs or high wave action areas, instead sitting on mud, sand or pebbles.\n\nIn Tasmania, due to the plague of these seastars, hunting days have been organized, where volunteers work together to physically remove as many of the seastars as possible. Efforts of this kind in 1993 resulted in the collection of more than 30,000 seastars. During the first attempts to remove the seastar from Tasmania, many of the seastars that were captured were cut up and thrown back into the sea. Unfortunately, each part that was thrown back was able to regenerate and grow a new seastar as long as it had part of the central disc remaining.\n\nSeastar poisons are not specific and in the ocean, could damage many other natural marine communities. Also, the amount of chemicals needed to poison seastars in estuaries would be uneconomical, and very impractical. In Australia, northern Pacific seastars don't have any pathogens, though in Japan, northern Pacific seastars are attacked by a unicelled animal called Orchitophrya. Orchitophrya invades seastars' testes, kills sperm, and castrates the seastar. However scientists later discovered that Orchitophrya doesn't usually invade all 10 of the seastar's testes and doesn't have the effect hoped for.\n\nThe northern Pacific seastar has also been found in Port Phillip Bay, Victoria, for some years now. The seastar has migrated inland in the Maribyrnong River, reaching as far inland as Essendon. The Maribyrnong is a salty river (previously known as Saltwater River), but finding the seastar this far inland is unusual.\n"}

The Rifa'iyya had its greatest following until the 15th century C.E. when it was overtaken by the Qadiri order. The order is said to wield particular influence in Cairo, Egypt. \n\nThe Rifa'i order is most commonly found in the Arab Middle East but also in Turkey, the Balkans and South Asia.\n\nRecords indicate Ahmad al-Rifa'i inherited his maternal uncle's, Mansur al-Bata'ihi, position of headship to his religious community in 1145-6 C.E. At this time many followed his activities in and around the village of Umm 'Ubayda. In the Lower Iraq marshlands, the Rifa'i order developed and gained notice throughout the 12th century C.E. due to its extravagant practices. Rifa'i expanded into Egypt and Syria.\n\nIn 1268 C.E., Abu Muhammad 'Ali al-Hariri formed the Syrian branch of the order which became known as the Haririya. The Rifa'i gained further popularity in Egypt and Turkey. In the 15th century C.E., its popularity waned and the popularity of the Qadiriyya order rose. Subsequently, interest in the Rifa'i order centered within Arab lands.\n\nThe order has a presence in Syria and Egypt and plays a noticeable role in Kosovo and Albania. The Rifa'i Tariqa blends worship styles or ideas with those of other orders that predominate in the local area. For example, the group established by Ken'an Rifa'i in Istanbul that reflects elements of the Mevlevi Order, while more rural Turkish Rifa'is have absorbed significant influence from the Alevi/Bektashi tradition.\n\nThe order spread into Anatolia during the 14th and 15th Centuries and ibn Battuta noted Rifa'i 'tekkes' in central Anatolia. The order however, began to make progress in Turkey during the 17th to 19th centuries when tekkes began to be found in Istanbul. The order spread into the Balkans (especially Bosnia, where they are still present), modern day Albania and Kosovo.\n\nIn the United States and Canada tekkes (lodges) are found in Staten Island and Toronto that were under the guidance of the late Shaykh Xhemali Shehu (d.2004) of Prizren, Kosovo. Each of these orders is ultimately Turkish in origin.\n\nThe original Rifai order has spawned many branches and derivatives. For example, the Islamic Sufi Order of Qadiri Rifai Tariqa of the Americas has been a legally registered non-profit organization since 1996. This order has students and branches in Australia, Germany, UK, South Africa, and Mauritius. The head of the order, Taner Ansari travels worldwide attending conferences, giving discourses, and has written many books. The order has its center established in Nassau, New York.\n\nDuring heightened states of Rifa'i Ratib, Rifa'i followers were noted to have eaten live snakes, entered ovens filled with fire and ridden on lions. Followers were also noted to have practiced charming snakes and thrusting iron spikes and glass into their bodies. \n\nIt is uncertain whether or not Ahmed ar-Rifa'i instituted the practices that helped solidify the Rifa'i order's massive popularity. While some scholars attribute these practices to al-Rifa'i, other scholars contend he was unaware of these practices and that these were introduced after the Mongol invasion.\n\n"}

{"id": "1804540", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1804540", "title": "Fragile binary interface problem", "text": "Fragile binary interface problem\n\nThe fragile binary interface problem or FBI is a shortcoming of certain object-oriented programming language compilers, in which internal changes to an underlying class library can cause descendant libraries or programs to cease working. It is an example of software brittleness.\n\nThis problem is more often called the fragile base class problem or FBC; however, that term has a wider sense.\n\nThe problem occurs due to a \"shortcut\" used with compilers for many common object-oriented (OO) languages, a design feature that was kept when OO languages were evolving from earlier non-OO structured programming languages such as C and Pascal.\n\nIn these languages there were no objects in the modern sense, but there was a similar construct known as a record (or \"struct\" in C) that held a variety of related information in one piece of memory. The parts within a particular record were accessed by keeping track of the starting location of the record, and knowing the offset from that starting point to the part in question. For instance a \"person\" record might have a first name, last name and middle initial, to access the initial the programmer writes codice_1 which the compiler turns into something like codice_2. Modern CPUs typically include instructions for this common sort of access.\n\nWhen object-oriented language compilers were first being developed, much of the existing compiler technology was used, and objects were built on top of the record concept. In these languages the objects were referred to by their starting point, and their public data, known as \"fields\", were accessed through the known offset. In effect the only change was to add another field to the record, which is set to point to an immutable virtual method table for each class, such that the record describes both its data and methods (functions). When compiled, the offsets are used to access both the data and the code (via the virtual method table).\n\nThis leads to a problem in larger programs when they are constructed from libraries. If the author of the library changes the size or layout of the public fields within the object, the offsets are now invalid and the program will no longer work. This is the FBI problem.\n\nAlthough changes in implementation may be expected to cause problems, the insidious thing about FBI is that nothing \"really\" changed, only the layout of the object that is hidden in a compiled library. One might expect that if one changes codice_3 to codice_4 that it might cause a problem, but in this case one can cause problems without changing codice_3, it can be caused as easily as moving lines of source code around for clarity. Worse, the programmer has little or no control over the resulting layout generated by the compiler, making this problem almost completely hidden from view.\n\nIn complex object-oriented programs or libraries the highest-level classes may be inheriting from tens of classes. Each of those base classes could be inherited by hundreds of other classes as well. These base classes are fragile because a small change to one of them could cause problems for any class that inherits from it, either directly or from another class that does. This can cause the library to collapse like a house of cards as many classes are damaged by one change to a base class. The problem may not be noticed when the modifications are being written if the inheritance tree is complex. Indeed, the developer modifying the base class is generally unaware of which classes, developed by others, are using it.\n\nOne solution to the fragile binary interface problem is to write a language that knows the problem exists, and does not let it happen in the first place. Most custom-written OO languages, as opposed to those evolved from earlier languages, construct all of their offset tables at load time. Changes to the layout of the library will be \"noticed\" at that point. Other OO languages, like Self, construct everything at runtime by copying and modifying the objects found in the libraries, and therefore do not really have a base class that can be fragile. Some languages, like Java, have extensive documentation on what changes are safe to make without causing FBI problems.\n\nAnother solution is to write out an intermediate file listing the offsets and other information from the compile stage, known as meta-data. The linker then uses this information to correct itself when the library is loaded into an application. Platforms such as .NET do this.\n\nHowever, the market has selected programming languages such as C++ that are indeed \"position dependent\" and therefore exhibit FBI. In these cases there are still a number of solutions to the problem. One puts the burden on the library author by having them insert a number of \"placeholder\" objects in case they need to add additional functionality in the future (this can be seen in the structs used in the DirectX library). This solution works well until you run out of these dummies -- and you do not want to add too many because it takes up memory.\n\nObjective-C 2.0 provides non-fragile instance variables by having an extra level of indirection for instance variable access.\n\nAnother partial solution is to use the Bridge pattern, sometimes known as \"Pimpl\" (\"Pointer to implementation\"). The Qt framework is an example of such an implementation. Each class defines only one data member, which is a pointer to the structure holding the implementation data. The size of the pointer itself is unlikely to change (for a given platform), so changing the implementation data does not affect the size of the public structure. However, this does not avoid other breaking changes such as introducing virtual methods to a class that has none, or changing the inheritance graph.\n\nAnother solution requires a smarter linker. In the original version of Objective-C, the library format allowed for multiple versions of one library and included some functionality for selecting the proper library when called. However this was not always needed because the offsets were only needed for fields, since methods offsets were collected at runtime and could not cause FBI. Since methods tend to change more often than fields, ObjC had few FBI problems in the first place, and those it did could be corrected with the versioning system. Objective-C 2.0 added a \"modern runtime\" which solved the FBI problem for fields as well. Additionally, the TOM language uses runtime collected offsets for everything, making FBI impossible.\n\nUsing static instead of dynamic libraries where possible is another solution, as the library then cannot be modified without also recompiling the application and updating the offsets it uses. However static libraries have serious problems of their own, such as a larger binary and the inability to use newer versions of the library \"automatically\" as they are introduced.\n\nIn these languages the problem is lessened by enforcing single inheritance (as this reduces the complexity of the inheritance tree), and by the use of interfaces instead of base classes with virtual functions, as interfaces themselves do not contain code, only a guarantee that each method signature the interface declares will be supported by every object that implements the interface.\n\nThe whole problem collapses if the source code of the libraries is available. Then a simple recompilation will do the trick.\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his role in a 1416 revolt against the Ottoman Empire, in which he and his disciples posed a serious challenge to the authority of Sultan Mehmed I and the Ottoman state. His full name was Sheikh Bedreddin Mahmud Bin Israel Bin Abdulaziz.\n\nMany details of Bedreddin's early life are disputed, as much of it is the subject of legend and folklore. He was born in 1359 in the town of Simavna (Kyprinos), near Edirne. His father was the \"ghazi\" of the town, and his mother was the daughter of a Greek Byzantine fortress commander. Notably, Bedreddin was of mixed Muslim and Christian parentage, with a Christian mother and a Muslim father; this contributed to his syncretic religious beliefs later in life. Turkish scholar Cemal Kafadar argues that Bedreddin's ghazi roots may also have contributed to his commitment to religious coexistence. In his youth he was a \"kadi\" to Ottoman warriors on the marches, which gave him ample experience in jurisprudence, a field of study in which he would become well-versed. Bedreddin was exposed to a variety of different cultures during his education, traveling far from his birthplace in Thrace. He studied theology in Konya, and then in Cairo, which was the capital of the Mamluk sultanate. After this, he traveled to Ardabil, in what is now Iranian Azerbaijan. Ardabil was under the control of the Timurids, and was home to the mystic Safavid order. Surrounded by mystics and far removed from the religious norms of the Ottoman Empire, Bedreddin was in an excellent place to cultivate his unconventional religious ideology. There he found an environment sympathetic to his pantheistic religious beliefs, and particularly the doctrine of \"oneness of being\". This doctrine condemned oppositions such as those of religion and social class as interference in the oneness of God and the individual, and such doctrine ran contrary to increasing Ottoman efforts to establish Sunni Islam as the state religion. By adopting it, Bedreddin further established himself as a subversive.\n\nDuring the Ottoman Interregnum after the defeat of sultan Bayezid I by Tamerlane in 1402, Bedreddin served as the kadiasker, or chief military judge, of the Ottoman prince Musa as Musa struggled with his brothers for control of the Ottoman sultanate. Along with the frontier bey Mihaloglu, he was a chief proponent of Musa's revolutionary regime. While kadiasker, Bedreddin gained the favor of many frontier ghazis by distributing \"timars\" among them. Through this he aided these unpaid ghazis in their struggle against centralization, a clear indication of his subversive side.\n\nAfter Musa’s defeat by Ottoman sultan Mehmed I in 1413, Bedreddin was exiled to Iznik, and his followers were dispossessed of their timars. However, he soon decided to capitalize on the climate of opposition to Mehmed I following the disorder of the still-fresh interregnum. Leaving his exile in Iznik in 1415, Bedreddin made his way to Sinop and from there across the Black Sea to Wallachia. In 1416, he raised the standard of revolt against the Ottoman state.\n\nMost of the revolts that ensued took place in regions of Izmir, Dobrudja, and Saruhan. The majority of his followers were Turcomans. The rest included frontier ghazis, dispossessed \"sipahis\", medrese students, and Christian peasants. The first of these rebellions was kindled in Karaburun, near Izmir. There, Borkluje Mustafa, one of Bedreddin’s foremost disciples, instigated an idealistic popular revolt by preaching the communal ownership of property and the equality of Muslims and Christians. Most those who revolted were Turkish nomads, but Borkluje’s followers also included many Christians. In total, approximately 6,000 people revolted against the Ottoman state in Karaburun. Torlak Kemal, another of Bedreddin’s followers, led another rebellion in Manisa, and Bedreddin himself was the leader of a revolt in Dobrudja, in contemporary northeastern Bulgaria. The heartland for the Dobrudja revolt was in the \"wild forest\" region south of the Danube Delta. Bedreddin found disciples among many who were discontent with sultan Mehmed; he became a figurehead for those who felt they had been disenfranchised by the sultan, including disgruntled marcher lords and many of those who had been given timars by Bedreddin as Musa's kadiasker, which had been revoked by Mehmed.\n\nThese uprisings posed a serious challenge to the authority of Mehmed I as he attempted to reunite the Ottoman Empire and govern his Balkan provinces. Although they were all eventually stifled, the series of coordinated revolts instigated by Bedreddin and his disciples was suppressed after only great difficulty. Torlak Kemal's rebellion in Manisa was crushed and he was executed, along with thousands of his followers. Borkluje's rebellion put up more of a fight than the others, defeating first the army of the governor of Saruhan and then that of the Ottoman governor Ali Bey, before finally it was finally crushed by the Vizier Bayezid Pasha. According to the Greek historian Doukas, Bayezid slaughtered unconditionally to ensure the rebellion's defeat, and Borkluje was executed along with two thousand of his followers. Sheikh Bedreddin's own Dobrudja rebellion was a short-lived one, and came to an end when Bedreddin was apprehended by Mehmed's forces and taken to Serres. Accused of disturbing the public order by preaching religious syncretism and the communal ownership of property, he was executed in the marketplace.\n\nSheikh Bedreddin was a prolific writer and religious scholar, and a distinguished member of the Islamic religious hierarchy. He is often regarded as a talented voice in religious sciences, particularly for his thoughts on Islamic law. For his works on jurisprudence he is classed among the great scholars of Islamic thought. On the other hand, many condemn him as a heretic for his radical ideas on religious syncretism. Bedreddin advocated overlooking religious difference, arguing against zealous proselytism in favor of a utopian synthesis of faiths. This latitudinarian interpretation of religion was a major part of what allowed him and his disciples to instigate a broad-reaching popular revolt in 1416, unifying a very heterogeneous base of support.\n\nBedreddin's religious origins were as a mystic. His form of mysticism was greatly influenced by the work of Ibn al-‘Arabi, and he is known to have written a commentary of al-‘ Arabi's book \"Fusus al-hikam\" (The Quintessence of Wisdom). Through his writings, he developed his own form of mysticism. His most significant book, \"Varidat\", or \"Divine Inspirations,\" was a compilation of his discourses which reflected on his ideas about mysticism and religion. Bedreddin was a monist, believing that reality is a manifestation of God's essence, and that the spiritual and physical worlds were inseparable and necessary to one another. As he writes in \"Varidat\", he believed that \"This world and the next, in their entirety, are imaginary fantasies; heaven and hell are no more than the spiritual manifestations, sweet and bitter, of good and evil actions.\"\n\nBedreddin's pantheistic beliefs greatly influenced many of his political and social ideas, particularly the doctrine of \"oneness of being.\" This doctrine condemns oppositions which its adherents believe hinder the oneness of the individual with God, including oppositions between religions and between the privileged and the powerless. This belief system is reflected in the beliefs of Bedreddin and his disciples, who, among other things, preached that all religions are essentially the same, as well as that ownership of property should be communal. Such ideas appealed greatly to those who felt marginalized in Ottoman society, and this egalitarian ideology played a major role in inspiring popular revolt in 1416.\n\nSheikh Bedreddin clearly had ambitious political aspirations when he began his rebellion. According to the 15th-century Sunni historian Idris of Bitlis, Bedreddin considered himself the Mahdi, who would bring about God's unity in the world by distributing his lands among his followers. Although Idris' account is partial, Bedreddin's ambitions as a political and religious leader are apparent. He even went so far as to claim that he was descended from the Seljuk royal house, undoubtedly to bolster his legitimacy as a potential ruler. It is plausible that he aspired to win the sultanate.\n\nThe revolt of 1416 marked a turning point in the toleration of non-Muslims by the Ottoman state. By crushing the rebellion aggressively and stigmatizing those who revolted, the state condemned popular discontent as illegitimate and further defined its position of opposition to religious nonconformists. After the revolt, Turco-Muslim presence in the Balkans became equivalent to an Ottoman presence. Bedreddin's rebellion made it clear to Ottoman statesmen that religious dissidence could pose a serious threat to their administrative structure, and in the years that followed, Murad II, Mehmed's successor, took steps to ensure that Islam was further established as the state's religion. For example, Murad expanded the Janissaries in the wake of the Bedreddin revolt to increase Ottoman military power, but also to create a steady flow of Christians being converted to Islam. This demonstrates a clear shift in Ottoman policy away from toleration of non-Muslims and closer to one of assimilation, a trend that would continue in the coming centuries.\n\nSects of Bedreddin's followers continued to survive long after his death. His teachings remained influential, and his sectarians were considered a threat until the late sixteenth century. Known as the Simavnis or the Bedreddinlus, a sect of his followers in Dobrudja and Deliorman continued to survive for hundreds of years after his execution. Unsurprisingly, the Ottoman government viewed this group with great suspicion. In the sixteenth century, they were regarded as identical to the Kizilbash, and persecuted along with them. Some of Bedreddin's doctrines also became common among some other mystic sects. One such sect was the Bektashi, a dervish order commonly associated with the Janissaries.\n\nSheikh Bedreddin continues to be known in Turkey, especially among socialists, communists, and other political leftists. In the twentieth century, he was brought back into the spotlight by the communist Turkish writer Nazim Hikmet, who wrote \"The Epic of Sheikh Bedreddin\" to voice opposition to the rise of fascism in the 1930s. Hikmet's work popularized Bedreddin as a historical champion of socialism and an opponent of fascist tyranny, and his name has remained well known to those on the left of the political spectrum. His bones were exhumed in 1924, but his devotees were so fearful of a backlash against Bedreddin's newfound political significance by the Turkish government that he was not buried until 1961. He was finally put to rest near the mausoleum of Mahmud II, in Istanbul.\n\n\n"}

It is the only widespread file format for representing tabulature, and is extensively used for disseminating tabulature via the Internet.\n\nASCII tab is intended to be a human-readable format rather than machine-readable, and hence is not strictly defined. Though some standards are used by all ASCII tab files, such as hyphens to represent string lines and digits to represent frets, other things such as barlines, rhythms, bends, chord symbols etc. may be present, absent or represented in a variety of ways. Additionally, ASCII tab files frequently contain lyrics and freeform text in unpredictable places.\n\nThere are various computer programs for creating guitar tabulature which can save ASCII tab files, but due to the unpredictability of the format, only a few (e.g. G7) can read arbitrary ASCII tab files created by humans.\n\nASCII tab files usually have the file extension .tab, .btab (for bass guitar) or .txt.\n\nThe tabulature for a C major chord on six-string guitar with standard tuning typically looks something like this:\n\nThe string tunings at the left-hand side are often omitted. When notating entire songs, usually a note near the beginning of the tabulature tells the reader what tuning the instrument should be in. The number on each line refers to the fret as in guitar tab. Sometimes an 'x' means that the string should be played, but muted with either the left-hand fingers or the right-hand palm. The chord symbol C is written above - again this may or may not be included.\n\nOther techniques, such as hammer-ons, string pulls (or pull-offs), slides, and bends may also be shown. Hammer-ons are usually shown with an \"h\" in between the fret to strike and the fret to hammer on. String pulls are shown with a \"p\". \"Tribute\" by Tenacious D is one example of a song that uses both of these:\n\nA trill is a combination of hammer-ons and pull-offs being performed in succession.\n\nSlides are shown in the same format, but with a slash (/) or the letter S in between the fret to slide from and the fret to slide to. \"ATWA\" by System of a Down is a song that uses these (in Drop D tuning):\n\nBending is often shown by a letter b, but may also be indicated by an ^. A bend can show how far the string is to be bent, when the string is to be released (denoted by an r), or that it is a bend to an unspecific note. Examples:\n\nIn the first example, a note played at the fifth fret on the G string (the note C) is bent up one full step so that it sounds like a note played at the seventh fret on the G string (the note D); secondly, the same note is played, but the bend is released so that the string again sounds a C note; thirdly, the string is bent to an undetermined note; fourthly, the string is bent to an undetermined note, and released back to the C note.\n\nASCII tab can also indicate rhythms above the staff; however this is rarely done. Barlines can be indicated using '|' characters (pipes). Lyrics may be added above or below the staff, either aligned with the music or as a continuous text block. Freeform text (describing the song, composer, transcriber, notational conventions used, etc.) is also often included at the start or end of the file, or used for relevant comments about a certain part of the song.\n\nASCII tab can also use various lines, arrows, and other symbols to denote bends, hammer-ons, trills, pull-offs, slides, and so on. These are the symbols that represent various techniques, though these may vary:\n"}
{"id": "1804632", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1804632", "title": "Team time trial", "text": "Team time trial\n\nA team time trial (TTT) is a road-based bicycle race in which teams of cyclists race against the clock (see individual time trial for a more detailed description of ITT events). \n\nThe winning team in a TTT is determined by the comparing the times of (usually) the fourth-finishing rider in each team (though the relevant finish position can be otherwise specified in advance by the race organisers). This means that each team will try to get their first four (at least) riders across the finish line in a tight group: it is actually a disadvantage for any rider to finish far in advance of the fourth rider, as by staying back a faster rider can help the fourth rider to get a quicker time.\n\nWhere a TTT is part of a stage race, it is necessary for each rider to be given a finish time that can be cumulated into the general classification timings. Hence, all riders in the team who finish in the leading bunch are given the time of the fourth rider, and any rider who has been dropped is timed individually in the usual way.\n\nTeams start at equal intervals, usually two, three or four minutes apart. Starting sequences will usually be based on individuals' times in previous events, but in TTTs conducted as part of a multi-stage road race (such as the Tour de France and the Giro d'Italia) the highest ranked teams will normally start later. Later starters have the advantage of knowing what times they need to beat (and this also makes the event more interesting to spectators).\n\nUnlike individual time trials where competitors are not permitted to 'draft' (ride in the slipstream) behind each other, in team time trials, riders in each team employ this as their main tactic, each member taking a turn at the front while teammates 'sit in' behind. After their turn, the lead rider will swing over, allowing the next rider to take the lead, while the leader goes to the back of the team.\n\nShould one team overtake another, the overtaken team would be expected to drop back.\n\nThe main principle behind a TTT is that a few riders can ride at the front of the formation slightly above their aerobic threshold while others draft behind these riders. The riders then rotate, allowing some riders to recover while drafting behind fresher teammates. A rider who is riding at the front is said to be taking a pull.\n\nAccelerations require harder efforts, and therefore it is desirable to have a smooth, steady pace. Different riders have different power outputs, lactate thresholds and aerodynamics. In order to equalize the efforts in order to not burn some riders off too early, the weaker riders take shorter pulls and stronger riders take longer pulls, all at the same speed to minimize the change in pace. A rider finishing a pull usually rotates to the \"very back of the formation\", and the rider who was formerly behind this rider takes over. A rider who needs more time to recover may take a longer time at the back of the formation while the other teammates rotate in front of this rider. With \"increased desired speed\", the riders take harder but shorter pulls at the front so as not to burn themselves up.\n\nThe choice of formation is crucial to the performance of the team because it dictates how fast the riders can rotate. The two most popular formations are the single paceline and double paceline. In a single paceline, riders take longer pulls. Often, a double paceline is desirable since each rider takes shorter pulls, and therefore a higher pace is able to be maintained. This is why double pacelines are more often seen at the end of a TTT event when the teams are nearing the finish line.\n\nThe recorded finishing time in a team time trial is often based on the N-th rider of that team. For example, in stage races such as the Tour de France or Giro d'Italia the finishing time is based on the 5th rider of the team, out of a total of 9 riders per team. Therefore, a team may choose to have a few of its riders take a death pull towards the end of the TTT event, in which the riders take as hard a pull at the front as possible in order to resist the pace at the cost of exhausting themselves with no hope of being able to latch onto the back of the formation for drafting. They then drop back and leave the remainder of the team to finish the time trial.\n\nAt the professional level, cycling teams are frequently accompanied by motorcycle outriders, team cars and official scrutineers. In a large stage race, the TTT will involve all remaining members of the team, with the time taken when, say, the fifth rider has crossed the line. This encourages a team to keep the minimum number together; the more riders a team has, the more the task of setting the pace can be shared; some teams may sacrifice weaker riders to maintain a higher pace, or strong riders may put in greater efforts over the early part of a course to give their team a good start before dropping off the pace and finishing alone.\n\nIn a stage race, teams usually consist of several members. Each member of the team is credited with the time of the N-th team member to cross the finish line; this is usually after the median member of a nine-person team (e.g. the fourth out of eight members of a team in the Tour de France as of 2018). However, if a rider is dropped from the team's main group on the course, finishing separately in (N+1)-th position or later, then the dropped rider will get his actual time, not that of the fifth rider. This means there are often difficult decisions to make regarding hanging back for a team leader, and chaos can often ensue if ground rules have not been made by the team's manager.\n\nThe '(N+1)-th rider' convention also prevents a team leader who is far stronger than his teammates from riding by himself and setting a pace that would give his weaker teammates an unfair boost in the general classification. Traditionally, each team received the exact time it recorded in that stage.\n\nFor two years, starting with the 2004 Tour de France, the only team that received its actual time in the Tour de France was the winning team; the trailing teams at worst received set time penalties based on their placings in that stage - for example, riders in a team that finished six minutes behind the winner might lose only three minutes in the general classification. According to this rule any team that finished within 30 seconds of the winning team would earn its actual time. This happened in 2005, as Team CSC finished two seconds behind Lance Armstrong's Discovery Channel team in that year's team time trial. With the team time trial returning for the 2009 Tour de France, this rule change was not retained. The team time trial in 2009 is almost 30 kilometres shorter than the one in the 2005 edition.\n\nIf a stage race starts with team time trial, the leader's jersey is given to a rider who finishes first of the winning team.\n\nThe fastest team time trial in the Tour de France was by Orica-GreenEDGE in 2013 during the 25 km team time trial around Nice. Orica-GreenEDGE had an average speed of 57.84 km/h (35.94 mph) and won the stage, with Simon Gerrans taking the yellow jersey. However, the team time trial was not held in the Tour from 2006 through to 2008. The 2009 Tour de France included a 39 km team time trial.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1999, UK amateur cycling club teams, each comprising four riders, competed in an annual national championship run over courses of 100 kilometres (the championship record time of 2:00:07 was achieved in 1993 by a team from North Wirral Velo which included Chris Boardman). The championship was reconstituted in 2004, with teams of three riders competing over 50 km courses (the 2005 event was won by the Recycling.co.uk team in a time of 1:01:20).\n\nTeam time trials are also popular during the early parts of the traditional March to September season, though riders are more likely to compete in teams of two or three; distances will tend to be 10 or 25 miles.\n\nUnique to the UK the Grand Prix des Gentlemen is a very special event, and rather unique for a two-up time trial. First held in 1970 and based on the Parisian cycle race 'Gentlemen à Aulnay'. The teams of two must include a veteran rider (over the age of 40), who is classed as the ‘Gentleman’, the other rider being the pacer. The Gentleman isn’t allowed to pass the pacer until 200 yards from the finish line. This is a challenging event and often has the older rider making every effort to hold the pace line to save energy and ensure he can contribute for the final pull. In the past riders such as Chris Boardman, Bradley Wiggins and Michael Hutchinson (cyclist) have raced the event as the pacer, while Tour de France rider Sean Yates has been th pacer as well as the 'Gentleman'.\n\n"}

They are differentiated from later Gibson banjos by their scarcity. Banjo sales plummeted during the Great Depression, for lack of buyers, and metal parts became scarce into the 1940s as factories shifted to support the war. As parts became scarce, non-standard versions came out, made from a variety of leftover parts, called floor sweep models.\n\nAlthough this term normally refers to World War II, when used to describe Gibson banjos, the term prewar operationally refers to banjos made prior to 1947. Production of metal banjo parts was suspended during World War II. However, small numbers of Gibson banjos continued to be constructed and shipped during the war years using stocks of metal parts remaining in factory bins. For that reason, Gibson banjos produced between 1940 and 1945 often reflect the creativity of shop personnel rather than standard catalogue descriptions. Production of metal banjo parts resumed in the Fall of 1946; however, it is commonly believed that the metal composition of foundry products delivered to Gibson after World War II was inferior to that of parts produced prior to 1940. On April 12, 1947, the Gibson Instrument Company changed their corporate logo from script lettering to the use of block letters, and this change occurred sufficiently close to resumption of banjo output to allow easy identification of prewar and postwar Gibson instruments.\n\nDetermining the authenticity of a prewar Gibson banjo can be a real challenge for a variety of reasons:\n\n"}
{"id": "1804683", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1804683", "title": "Operation Jericho", "text": "Operation Jericho\n\nOperation Jericho was a low-level Second World War bombing raid on 18 February 1944, by Allied aircraft on Amiens Prison in German-occupied France.\n\nThe objective of the raid was to free French Resistance and political prisoners. The raid is remarkable for the precision and daring of the attack, which was filmed by a camera on one of the aeroplanes. There is debate as to who requested the attack and whether it was necessary.\n\nMosquito bombers succeeded in breaching the walls and buildings of the prison, as well as destroying guards' barracks. Of the 717 prisoners, 102 were killed, 74 wounded and 258 escaped, including 79 Resistance and political prisoners, although two-thirds of the escapees were recaptured.\n\nIn 1943, many members of the French resistance movement in the Amiens area had been caught by the Germans and imprisoned in Amiens Prison. Some had been betrayed by collaborators and the entire movement in the area was at risk. By December 1943, 12 members of the resistance had been executed at the prison and it was learned that more than 100 other members were to be shot on 19 February 1944. Dominique Ponchardier began sending information about the prison to London, including details of the layout, defences and duty rosters.\n\nWhen two Allied intelligence officers were captured and sent to Amiens prison, a precision air attack on the prison was requested and the mission was allocated to the 2nd Tactical Air Force. The prison was next to a long straight road and surrounded by high walls. The guards ate in a building adjacent to the main prison building, making lunch the best time to kill the maximum number of guards.\n\nThe balance of munitions used had to be arranged so that when hitting the main prison walls, they were breached and the cell doors sprung open without the building being destroyed. As well as destroying the guards' mess hall, the outer walls had to be breached to allow the inmates to escape. There were around 700 inmates in the prison and loss of life was inevitable during an air raid but it was thought that many had already been condemned to death and it would give a chance for some at least to escape.\n\nNo. 140 Wing of the RAF Second Tactical Air Force, based at RAF Hunsdon in Hertfordshire, was selected to carry out the raid using Mosquito FB Mk VIs. The Wing comprised 18 Mosquitos from No. 464 Squadron RAAF, No. 487 Squadron RNZAF and No. 21 Squadron RAF and was led by the Wing's commander, Group Captain Percy Charles Pickard (DSO and two bars, DFC).\n\nThe Mosquitos of 487 Squadron were to breach the outer walls of the prison, while 464 Squadron was to bomb the guard's quarters and the mess hall. No. 21 Squadron was to act as reserve and breach the walls if the first two squadrons failed. The raid was to be led by Air Vice-Marshal Basil Embry and was ready to go from 10 February. Close escort was to be provided by Hawker Typhoons from No. 198 Squadron RAF and No. 174 Squadron RAF.\n\nEmbry was originally intended to command the attack but was later forbidden from flying on the mission, as he was involved in the planning of the invasion of Europe. Pickard took his place, despite his limited experience of low-level attack. The mission was delayed by very poor weather, which worsened after 10 February, with low cloud and snow across Europe. By 18 February, it was not possible to wait any longer and the 18 Mosquitos, plus a PR (photo-reconnaissance) Mosquito (\"O\" for Orange), were prepared. The crews were briefed at 08:00 under high security, the first time they had been made aware of the target. Pickard, in \"F\" for Freddie, was to bring up the rear of the second wave of aircraft, to assess the damage and to call in 21 Squadron if necessary. In the event of anything happening to Pickard's aircraft, the crew of the PR Mosquito would broadcast the signal instead.\n\nThe final decision to carry out the attack was made two hours before the deadline for striking the target and the Mosquitos took off from Hunsdon, into weather worse than many of the crews had previously experienced. Four Mosquitos lost contact with the formation and had to return to base and one had to turn back due to engine trouble, leaving nine to carry out the main attack with four in reserve.\n\nAt one minute past noon they reached the target, three of the 487 Squadron aircraft aiming for the eastern and northern walls of the prison, with bombs fitted with eleven-second delayed-action fuses, while the other two made a diversion attack on the local railway station, before returning to the prison. The outer walls were breached but the 464 Squadron Mosquitos were too close behind and had to circle while the bombs detonated.\n\nThe eastern wall appeared un-breached at 12:06, when two aircraft from 464 Squadron attacked it from an altitude of , with eight bombs but observers did not see any damage to the prison. Simultaneously, two Mosquitos from 464 Squadron bombed the main building from , also with eight bombs. A direct hit on the guardhouse killed or disabled the occupants and a number of prisoners were killed or wounded, while many were able to escape. Pickard, circling at , saw prisoners escape and signalled the No. 21 Squadron Mosquitos to return home. As he turned for home, hits from a Fw 190 fighter of JG 26 severed the tail of his Mosquito and the crash killed him and his navigator. A total of 255 prisoners escaped, though 182 were recaptured. The diversion attack on the railway station delayed German reinforcements, sent to recapture the escapees, by two hours.\n\nThe circumstances involving the request and the true purpose of the mission have remained a secret. While it has been widely believed that the request came from the French resistance, which had members in the prison scheduled to be executed, a post-war investigation by the RAF revealed that resistance leaders were not aware of the raid until the RAF requested a detailed description of the prison.\n\nThe raid resulted in over 250 prisoners escaping and killed a number of German guards. However, 102 prisoners were killed in the attack, and many who escaped were later recaptured.\n\nA letter is on record from the head of the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), Stewart Menzies, thanking the RAF for its execution of the raid. (The letter is signed by \"C\", a code name for Menzies.) This suggests that the SIS played a role in the planning of the raid. When the head of the SOE's French section, Maurice Buckmaster, was confronted with the fact of the letter signed by \"C\", he stated that he had never seen it, but that \"C\" referred to the head of the SIS, Buckmaster said that he had not requested the raid and did not know who had.\n\nA 2011 BBC television documentary on Operation Jericho suggested the raid may have been intended to divert the attention of German military intelligence and away from Normandy, where the D-Day invasion took place a few months later.\n\nA plaque at the prison is dedicated to those who died in the attack and a general airfield memorial is at Hunsdon Airfield, the Mosquito base. On the 60th anniversary in 2004, a Spitfire performed a flypast, as none of the surviving Mosquitos were airworthy.\n\n\"Mosquito Squadron\", a 1969 British war film directed by Boris Sagal and starring David McCallum, was partially inspired by this operation.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The yard had a capacity of 420 cars and could store 31 locomotives in a roundhouse with adjacent repair shops. The York Railway Station was built on the north side of the tracks just east of Main Street around 1883.

{"id": "1804697", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1804697", "title": "Step pyramid", "text": "Step pyramid\n\nA step pyramid or stepped pyramid is an architectural structure that uses flat platforms, or steps, receding from the ground up, to achieve a completed shape similar to a geometric pyramid. Step pyramids are structures which characterized several cultures throughout history, in several locations throughout the world. These pyramids typically are large and made of several layers of stone. The term refers to pyramids of similar design that emerged separately from one another, as there are no firmly established connections between the different civilizations that built them.\n\nZiggurats were huge religious monuments built in the ancient Mesopotamian valley and western Iranian plateau, having the form of a terraced step pyramid of successively receding stories or levels. There are thirty-two ziggurats known at, and near, Mesopotamia. Twenty-eight of them are in Iraq, and four of them are in Iran. Notable Ziggurats include the Great Ziggurat of Ur near Nasiriyah, Iraq, the Ziggurat of Aqar Quf near Baghdad, Iraq, Chogha Zanbil in Khūzestān, Iran, the most recent to be discovered – Sialk near Kashan, Iran and others. \n\nZiggurats were built by the Sumerians, Babylonians, Elamites and Assyrians as monuments to local religions. The probable predecessors of the ziggurat were temples supported on raised platforms or terraces that date from the Ubaid period during the 4th millennium BC, and the latest date from the 6th century BC. The earliest ziggurats probably date from the latter part of the Early Dynastic Period of Sumer. Built in receding tiers upon a rectangular, oval, or square platform, the ziggurat was a pyramidal structure. Sun-baked bricks made up the core of the ziggurat with facings of fired bricks on the outside. The facings were often glazed in different colors and may have had astrological significance. Kings sometimes had their names engraved on these glazed bricks. The number of tiers ranged from two to seven, with a shrine or temple at the summit. Access to the shrine was provided by a series of ramps on one side of the ziggurat or by a spiral ramp from base to summit. It was also called Hill of Heaven or Mountain of the gods.\n\nThe earliest Egyptian pyramids were step pyramids. In the 1st Dynasty at Saqarra, a large step pyramid like structure was found within the interior of Mastaba 3808 dating to the reign of the pharaoh Anedjib. Egyptologist Walter B Emery found other mastabas of this late 1st Dynasty period that may have been of similar design in which several inscriptions depicting step pyramids during this era are also found, mostly credited to Anedjib's successor Qa'a. . The first recognized step pyramid, however, dates to the beginning of the Third Dynasty attributed to the pharaoh Djoser. Though Egyptologists often credit his vizier Imhotep as its architect, the Dynastic Egyptians themselves, contemporaneously or in numerous later Dynastic writings about the character, did not credit him with either the designing of the Pyramid of Djoser or the invention of stone architecture. Djoser's pyramid was first built as a square mastaba like structure, which as a rule were known to otherwise be rectangular, and expanded several times by way of a series of accretion layers to produce the stepped pyramid structure we see today. Later pharaohs, including Sekhemkhet and possibly Khaba, built similar structures, known as the Buried Pyramid and the Layer Pyramid, respectively.\n\nIn the Fourth Dynasty, the Egyptians began to build \"true pyramids\" with smooth sides. The earliest of these pyramids, located south of Saqarra and Giza at Meidum, was first constructed as a finished \"tower-shaped\" step pyramid like structure and later converted to a true pyramid which at some point this layer collapsed. Though there is disagreement among Egyptologists whether Sneferu or his predecessor Huni built the tower core, it is generally accepted Sneferu at the least was responsible for converting it to a true pyramid. Sneferu is also credited with building two other pyramids, the Bent Pyramid and the Red Pyramid at Dahshur, which were the first true pyramids to be built as such from the beginning. Though with this innovation the outwardly appearance of Egyptian stepped pyramids came to an end in favor of smooth-sided true pyramids, the pyramids that followed whose cores have been exposed all show some form of stepped pyramid at their center.\n\nOne of the unique structures of Igboland was the Nsude Pyramids, at the Nigerian town of Nsude, northern Igboland. Ten pyramidal structures were built of clay/mud. The first base section was 60 ft. in circumference and 3 ft. in height. The next stack was 45 ft. in circumference. Circular stacks continued, till it reached the top. The structures were temples for the god Ala/Uto, who was believed to reside at the top. A stick was placed at the top to represent the god's residence. The structures were laid in groups of five parallel to each other. Because it was built of clay/mud like the Deffufa of Nubia, time has taken its toll requiring periodic reconstruction.\n\nA step pyramid exists in the archaeological site of Monte d'Accoddi, in Sardinia, dating to the 4th millennium BC: \"a trapezoidal platform on an artificial mound, reached by a sloped causeway. At one time a rectangular structure sat atop the platform ... the platform dates from the Copper Age (c. 2700–2000 BC), with some minor subsequent activity in the Early Bronze Age (c. 2000–1600 BC). Near the mound are several standing stones, and a large limestone slab, now at the foot of the mound, may have served as an altar.\"\n\nThe most prolific builders of these step pyramids were the pre-Columbian civilizations. The remains of step pyramids can be found throughout the Mayan cities of the Yucatán, as well as in Aztec and Toltec architecture. In many of these cases, successive layers of pyramids were built on top of the pre-existing structures, with which the pyramids expanded in size on a cyclical basis. This is true of the Great Pyramid of Cholula and of the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan.\n\nStep pyramids were also a part of South American architecture, such as that of the Moche and the Chavín culture.\n\nThere are a number of earthwork step pyramids within North America. Often associated with mounds and other mortuary complexes across the Eastern Woodlands (concentrated in the North American Southeast), step pyramids were constructed as ceremonial centers by the Mississippian cultures (900–1500 CE), and are regarded as a facet of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex.\n\nThe largest earthen work step pyramid of this type in North America is Monks Mound, located in present-day Cahokia, Illinois. With the base of the structure exceeding 16 acres Monks Mound is also one of the largest pyramids by area in the world (after La Danta and Great Pyramid of Cholula).\n\nAs well as menhirs, stone tables, and stone statues Austronesian megalithic culture in Indonesia also featured earth and stone step pyramid structure, referred to as \"punden berundak\" as discovered in Pangguyangan site near Cisolok and in Cipari near Kuningan. The construction of stone pyramids is based on the native beliefs that mountains and high places are the abode for the spirit of the ancestors. \n\nThe step pyramid is the basic design of 8th century Borobudur Buddhist monument in Central Java. However the later temples built in Java were influenced by Indian Hindu architecture, as displayed by the towering spires of Prambanan temple. In the 15th century Java during the late Majapahit period saw the revival of Austronesian indigenous elements as displayed by Sukuh temple that somewhat resembles a Mesoamerican pyramid, and also stepped pyramids of Mount Penanggungan.\n\n\n"}

This would also help to ease rush hour congestion on the 504 King streetcar.\n\nThe original Grand Trunk Railway station consisted of a wooden frame building, located on the south side of the tracks just east of Dufferin Street. The grade separation, which was done between 1910 and 1912, resulted in the demolition of that station since it was necessary to build a retaining wall along the south side of the cutting. New Dufferin Gates were constructed at the entrance to Exhibition Place, with concrete stairs down to two side platforms west of the new bridge over the tracks. Passenger service continue to operate there until the 1960s.\n\nWork to widen the platforms and add a snowmelt system, an accessible boarding area, and platform canopies began in the fall of 2012 and was completed in the spring of 2016.\n\nExhibition is the southwestern terminus of the proposed Ontario Line. The line is targeted for an opening in 2027.\n"}

It is down the line from via and is situated between and . It is managed by Southern.\n\nTrains calling at Hassocks are operated by Southern and Thameslink.\n\nThe station was named \"Hassocks Gate\" upon its opening on 21 September 1841 by the London and Brighton Railway, which became the London Brighton and South Coast Railway in 1846. It was one of the few intermediate stations on the line with four tracks, to allow express trains to overtake those stopping at the station. However, the number of tracks was later reduced to two, although the additional width is still apparent from the siting of the station buildings.\n\nThe original 1841 station building was designed by David Mocatta, the architect of the railway, in a simple cottage style, but using the same modular system that he applied to other stations on the line.\n\nFor many years Hassocks Gate station was used by excursion trains for passengers visiting the nearby South Downs and suffered as a result as it became a meeting place for prostitutes. It stands almost at the summit of the line's climb from London before passing through Clayton Tunnel, a short distance south of the station. This was the site of the Clayton Tunnel rail crash in 1861, resulting in 23 deaths and 176 injuries.\n\nBetween December 1880 and August 1881 a new station building was constructed by James Longley & Co of Crawley to the designs of Thomas Myres as the prototype for those later built in the same style on the Bluebell and Cuckoo line with a half-timbered upper storey, decorative brick eaves, stained glass windows and charming porches. The booking office was covered by a lantern-shaped roof and the platforms by wooden canopies on iron columns. The station was demolished in 1973 by British Rail and replaced with a CLASP structure which was described as \"truly awful\".\nIn 2006 the local community announced that it was hoping to raise £2.5m to rebuild the station to the previous design. Although these plans fell through, in 2008 Network Rail announced that it would be carrying out an 18-month feasibility study to identify possible improvements to the existing building in order to facilitate access by the disabled and elderly. Limited modifications were made to the station in 2011 with the addition of ticket gate lines on both platforms and some refurbishment of the shelters. In January 2011 it was announced by Network Rail that £1.25 million would be used to rebuild the station under the Department for Transport’s National Station Improvement Programme and that a further £1.6 million, from the Access for All scheme, used to install step-free access.\n\nWork began on building the new station in November 2012 and the new ticket office opened for the first time on 14 June 2013. At this point there was still work to be completed including the installation of lifts to improve access to the subway however the opening of the new station officially took place on Friday 5 July 2013, conducted by the MD of Southern and Catherine Cassidy. Work was completed by December 2013.\n\nThe station features in Sabine Baring-Gould's mid-Victorian ghost story \"The 9.30 Up-train\".\n\nThe typical service from the station is:\n\n\nTrain services to Bedford were replaced with services to Cambridge in late 2019\n"}

It is down the line from via and is situated between and on the main line. Train services are provided by Southern and Thameslink.\n\nThe first station at Burgess Hill was opened on 21 September 1841 by the London and Brighton Railway (L&BR), at the time of the completion of the route to Brighton. The original facilities were all in the small wooden hut (which still stands on platform 1) and wooden platforms set beside the main line. The L&BR became the London Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&SCR) in 1846 and a track plan of the station dating from 1874 shows that by then several sidings and a signal box had been constructed at the station.\n\nThe present station building dates from 1877 and is typical of LB&SCR stations of the period.\n\nThe station has a typical double-track layout, with two side platforms each long enough to hold a 12-car train. Both platforms are signalled bidirectionally, but in normal service platform 1 is used by northbound services towards London (and beyond to Bedford and Cambridge), while platform 2 is for southbound trains to Brighton and Littlehampton. Both platforms are covered by shelters approximately four carriages long at the north end, and there are also smaller shelters further down the platforms. There is a small café and an accessible toilet located on platform 1 and a small waiting room on platform 2.\n\nThe station has two car parks: the main one next to platform 1 and a smaller one adjacent to platform 2. Both car parks include disabled parking spaces.\n\nThere are three entrances/exits to and from the station, all featuring ticket barriers. The main entrance/exit is through the station building on Station Road, which includes the ticket office and also houses a small newsagent and a cash machine. Access to the platforms from the station building is via two sheltered sets of stairs, which also act as a footbridge between the two platforms. The other two entrances/exits link the platforms directly with the station's car parks. These entrances/exits are both fully wheelchair-accessible, but each one only connects directly to one of the platforms - access to the other platform is only via the aforementioned footbridge. This means that step-free access is available to both platforms, but step-free access \"between\" the two platforms is only possible by venturing outside the station. Ticket machines are located by each of the three entrances.\n\nAs of July 2019, the typical off-peak Monday-Friday service pattern from this station is:\n\n\nAt peak times the Southern services between London Victoria and Brighton are replaced by Gatwick Express services on the same route, while Southern additionally serves the station with two trains per hour between London Victoria and (via and ).\n\nOn Saturdays the Thameslink services between Brighton and Cambridge are reduced to hourly, although upon completion of the Thameslink Programme it is planned to increase these to half-hourly as well.

He was raised in a poor family. Although a top student, he dropped out of school to work alongside his father. He failed to get employment with the National Iranian Oil Company. He then decided to continue his education. After obtaining a high school diploma, he joined the armed forces and studied at the Military Academy. During that time the country was experiencing political turmoil. He became a member of a clandestine political organization comprising army colonels. They had left-wing political inclinations and opposed the then leader of Iran Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. On August 19, 1953, the nationalist government of Mohammad Mosaddeq was overturned through a Shah-backed coup d'état. Activities of the organization were disclosed after Zahedi swept to power, and Afghani was arrested along with a number of his colleagues. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, but he was released after five years due to a commutation.\n\nAfghani wrote his masterpiece \"Madam Ahou's Husband\" while in prison and he himself published his masterpiece in 1961 because no publisher accepted to publish such a long novel written by an unknown writer, but after its publication many famous writers admired it. Literary figures such as the renowned translator Najaf Daryabandari and the prominent author Mohammad Ali Jamalzadeh praised his novel. The novel depicts the appalling life of Iranian women in that era.\n\nDaryabandari once stated, \"Looking into the life of the rabble, the author in this book pictures a painful tragedy. The scenes described in the book are reminiscent of masterpieces written by Leo Tolstoy and Honoré de Balzac. I have never had the same opinion about any other Persian books.\"\n\nIn March 1962, Jamalzadeh, in a letter to a friend, wrote, \"I received \"Madam Ahou’s Husband\". I think fellow writers and I should kiss goodbye writing. Iran is a bizarre country. It nurtures talented youth in no time. What a wonderful book! Such descriptive images.\"\n\nIn 1965, Afghani published his second novel, \"Joyful People of Qarrasu Valley\". The novel is about the love of a poor boy for the daughter of the village lord. It also depicts political currents of the post-1941 period.\n\nHis other works include \"Woven of Grief\", \"Sindokht\", \"Turnip Is a Paradisal Fruit\" and \"Cousin Parvin\".

It is located within the historic county of Monmouthshire.\n\nThe town houses a growing number of light industrial and high-tech firms. It is the home town of influential rock band Manic Street Preachers.\n\nBlackwood was founded in the early 19th century by local colliery owner John Hodder Moggridge, who lived at nearby Woodfield Park Estate: the first houses in Blackwood were built by Moggridge in an attempt to build a model village.\n\nDeplorable working conditions at the time of the Industrial Revolution, however, led to Blackwood becoming a centre of Chartist organisation in the 1830s. The South Wales Chartist leaders John Frost, Zephaniah Williams – a Blackwood man – and William Jones met regularly at the Coach & Horses public house in Blackwood. Planning their march on Newport in what became known as the Newport Rising in 1839, intended to coincide with a Britain-wide 'revolution' against the Government, the gentry and the Establishment in 1839.\n\nWhen the insurrection erupted in November a large contingent of insurgents gathered at Blackwood. Upon meeting their comrades from the upper Sirhowy Valley the rebels armed themselves with makeshift weapons and marched south to Newport to demand the adoption of the People's Charter and the release of Henry Vincent from Monmouth gaol. However, the South Wales Movement were the only ones to march and the national rising failed and its leaders were sentenced to death (later commuted to deportation to Tasmania).\n\nIn 1912 the Titanic's distress signals were picked up by amateur wireless enthusiast Artie Moore who resided at the Old Mill, Gelligroes, just outside the town. Moore went on to work as a senior scientist for Marconi and was involved with the invention of the transistor for telecommunications.\n\nThe former Penllwyn House on the outskirts of the town was originally part of the Lord Tredegar Estates and is believed to be the original home of the family of Henry Morgan (c. 1635 – 1688), a privateer and Governor of Jamaica. The building is now a public house The town is home to the Maes Manor Hotel, located in a grand old manor house known as Maesrudded. The house was formerly home to the Lord Lieutenant of Monmouthshire.\n\nEvan James (Ieuan ap Iago, 1809–93) was a weaver and wool merchant by profession and owner of the Ancient Druid Inn in Hollybush, in the parish of Bedwellty, Monmouthshire. He moved to Pontypridd when his son James (Iago ap Ieuan, 1833–1902) was a young boy. Evan James and his son James are credited with composing the Welsh national anthem, 'Hen Wlad fy Nhadau' ('Land of my Fathers') in 1856. Evan was a poet and it is believed that he wrote the words while his son James composed the tune. The song was published in the volume 'Gems of Welsh Melody' (1860) and soon became extremely popular. It is not certain when the song was first adopted as the Welsh national anthem. A memorial, designed by W. Goscombe John, was erected in honour of Evan and James James in Ynysangharad Park, Pontypridd, in 1930.\n\nThe decline of the coal mining industry throughout the later part of the twentieth century affected South Wales, the major source of employment was lost and the landscape left daily reminders of what had been. State backed rejuvenation schemes have gone some way to rejuvenate the wider Blackwood area, including the relief road and various light industrial areas.\n\nIn sport, Blackwood has two rugby union and one rugby league sides, all of whom play at Glan-Yr-Afon Park. The rugby union sides are Blackwood RFC, established in 1889, and Blackwood Stars RFC, originating . The rugby league club is called the Blackwood Bulldogs and plays in the Welsh Conference Premier. Rugby players Kevin Moseley, Alun Pask and Alun Lewis hail from the town.\n\nBlackwood also has a cricket club called Blackwood Town Cricket Club that plays in the Glamorgan and Monmouthshire League Division One. A number of Blackwood players have gone on to play for Glamorgan, Ryan Watkins and Kyle Tudge amongst them\n\nThe Bus Station, which links Blackwood to a lot of surrounding areas and includes a rail-link service to nearby train stations, has had a make-over.\n\nBlackwood's cinema, the Maxime, was originally purpose-built as a cinema in 1938, was then used as a bingo hall, but is now once again a five-screen cinema. Some of the original decor has been preserved in the foyer.\n\nBlackwood is twinned with Protivín, a small town in the Czech Republic.\n\nThe Arup designed Chartist Bridge linking the East and West sides of the Sirhowy Valley. Previously the journey was made by de-tour or over a 1 in 4 road through the bottom of the valley known locally as the Rhiw.\n\nThe bridge is a part of the Sirhowy Enterprise Way, regeneration project and opened four months ahead of schedule on 3 December 2005.\n\nThe bridge is a cable-stayed bridge 230m long supported 30m above the valley floor by a 90m A frame pylon. Difficulties with mining-related subsidence during construction and in the foreseeable future led the design team to allow the bridge to breathe if settlement does occur. The bridge and the Sirhowy Enterprise Way are operated and maintained by the DBFO Company (Design, Build, Finance and Operate) in accordance with the DBFO contract for a period of thirty years.\n\nA statue to honour the Chartist struggle and their march to Newport has been erected on the East side of the bridge while a name plate is situated on the West. The statue itself is an impressive and imposing figure of a chartist striding forward, pike in hand. It is made up of thousands of brass rings and represents strength in unity.\n\nBlackwood Miners Institute is described by Caerphilly County Borough Council as the \"Heart of the Community\", from its inception in 1925 as Snooker Hall to its current Multi Entertainment Venue it sits at the heart of the town's event programme and is known locally as \"The 'stute\".\n\nIn 1925 a Snooker Hall was opened, by the Coal Industry and the Social Welfare Organisation, and funded by the miners of Oakdale Colliery at the rate of 3d a week. The building was initially single-story but by 1936 another two floors had been added and by then the building had an auditorium, dance floor, reading room, library, ladies room and rehearsal rooms for local societies. Programmes from the time included Tea Dances, snooker/billiards, reading groups, rehearsals and union meetings for local miners.\n\nWith the decline of the mining industry the building fell into disrepair throughout the 1970s and 1980s and ownership was handed to Islwyn Borough Council with the mandate to make it available for community use.\n\nThe building was formally re-opened in February 1992 by Lynne Vaughan, who was Theatre Manager between September 1991 and June 1995. Funded by Islwyn Borough Council and the Welsh Office, it has given local dramatic societies the opportunity to perform on the same stage as Jasper Carrot, Ken Dodd and Welsh National Opera.\n\nThe 1904–1905 Welsh Revival and the prominence of Christianity in the culture of Blackwood and the surrounding villages have left Blackwood with a high number of churches and chapels, although many are now disused, derelict and falling to ruin.\n\nNon-conformist churches include Mount Pleasant Baptist Church on Cefn Road, Blackwood Methodist Church, the Oasis Christian Centre (Charismatic) and Blackwood Pentecostal (Pentecostal Movement)\n\nAnglican churches include St. Margaret's (Church in Wales), located at the top of the High Street. There is a Roman Catholic church, Sacred Heart, in nearby Pontllanfraith.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, sometimes referred to as Mormons, have a history here.\n\nThe Boys' Brigade and Girls' Brigade are in Blackwood with companies meeting at the Baptist and Methodist churches, there are also a number of Christian youth groups.\n\nThere is a network of primary schools, junior schools and secondary schools. The town is provided for by three local comprehensive schools all with between 800 – 1000 pupils. The Secondary schools are Blackwood Comprehensive School, Pontllanfraith Comprehensive and Oakdale Comprehensive. As of 2017 Pontllanfraith Comprehensive and Oakdale Comprehensive schools have merged to become Islwyn High School. Until the mid-1990s Blackwood comprehensive had separate uniforms for senior and junior pupils. A number of Blackwood pupils have been to Oxbridge and to other leading educational institutions.\n\nAn increase in demand for Welsh language medium education has led to the establishment of two Welsh Medium Infants and Primary schools. Ysgol Trelyn is located in the community of Pengam to the west of Blackwood and the newly opened Ysgol Cwm Derwen is located in the village of Oakdale to the east of the town. Both schools are 'feeder' schools to the Secondary School Ysgol Gyfun Cwm Rhymni located in Fleur de Lys, a village adjacent to Pengam to the west of Blackwood.\n\nBlackwood is in the middle of the Sirhowy Valley, the source of the river near Tredegar to the North and the confluence with the River Ebbw to the South. The main road to Blackwood and for traffic heading North or South was through Blackwood High Street (B4521) until the Sirhowy Enterprise Way was opened in 2005. Sirhowy Enterprise way was 4.3 km of new single carriageway roads following the former Pennar Branch railway line \n(closed 1989) on the Eastern Side of the valley, connected by the Chartist Bridge to the North and a bridge linking Woodfieldside to Blackwood in the south. The new roads which link to the A472 and the A467 provide links with Newport and other major towns and have closed off local roads such as the 1 in 4 incline of the Rhiw.\n\nBlackwood has no heavy or light rail links, local bus services run between Blackwood Bus Station and Ystrad Mynach with a link to the Transport for Wales, Rhymney Line. Blackwood appears in the preliminary South Wales Metro plan published by Transport for Wales as being a possible extension to the rail links. The Sirhowy Tramroad, which was constructed in 1797, ran through what is now High Street. The tramroad was converted to a standard-gauge Railway in 1860 and was taken over by The London & North Western Railway (LNWR) in 1876 which was incorporated into The London, Midland & Scottish Railway (LMS) in 1923. Passenger services ran from June 1865 until June 1960, Mineral traffic to coal yards at Blackwood & Tredegar continued until April 1969 with track lifted the following year. Some evidence of the railway still exists such as the underpass at Cwmgelli, most of the line is now a cycle path. The site of Blackwood railway station is now occupied by KFC.\n\nThe town has since been served by buses. There were two major companies in the Eastern and Central Valleys, namely:\n\nRed & White and Western Welsh merged to become National Welsh in 1978, which was privatised in 1987. Its operations were acquired by Stagecoach in South Wales in 1992.\n\nOther operators have included:\n\nThe Rotary Club of Blackwood was formed in 1946 and currently has seventeen male members and one female member. The Club meets every Tuesday at Maes Manor Hotel and is active in the local community. The Club raises funds for various charities and supports extracurricular activities in local schools.\n\nEvery Christmas, club members can be found at the entrance to the town's Asda store, with a miniature nativity scene, raising funds that the Club donates to local charities.\n\nOn 6 December 2012 the Club hosted the Welsh premiere of the Dustin Hoffman film \"Quartet\". The venue for this premiere was Cardiff's Cineworld complex, with an after film party at a Cardiff hotel.\n\nIn early August 2014 Blackwood's Maxime cinema reopened its doors after being purchased by new owners and after being given an extensive refit. On 5 August the Rotary Club of Blackwood hosted the cinema's gala opening evening. The film chosen for this event was the aptly named \"Blackwood\", a 2014 ghost story from an independent production company.\nThe Club's 2018 president was Trevor Morgan, a local clergyman.\n\nBlackwood is currently represented on Caerphilly County Borough Council by three Independent councillors: Kevin Etheridge, Andrew Farina-Childs and Nigel Dix.\n\n\n"}

This enables automatic management branching and merging, speeds up most operations (except pushing and pulling), improves the ability to work offline, and does not rely on a single location for backups.\n\nIn 2010, software development author Joel Spolsky described distributed version control systems as \"possibly the biggest advance in software development technology in the [past] ten years\".\n\nDistributed version control systems (DVCS) use a peer-to-peer approach to version control, as opposed to the client–server approach of centralized systems. Distributed revision control synchronizes repositories by transferring patches from peer to peer. There is no single central version of the codebase; instead, each user has a working copy and the full change history.\n\nAdvantages of DVCS (compared with centralized systems) include:\n\nDisadvantages of DVCS (compared with centralized systems) include:\n\nSome originally centralized systems now offer some distributed features. For example, Subversion is able to do many operations with no network. Team Foundation Server and Visual Studio Team Services now host centralized and distributed version control repositories via hosting Git.\n\nSimilarly, some distributed systems now offer features that mitigate the issues of checkout times and storage costs, such as the Virtual File System for Git developed by Microsoft to work with very large codebases, which exposes a virtual file system that only downloads files to local storage as they are needed.\n\nThe distributed model is generally better suited for large projects with partly independent developers, such as the Linux kernel project, because developers can work independently and submit their changes for merge (or rejection). The distributed model flexibly allows adopting custom source code contribution workflows. The integrator workflow is the most widely used. In the centralized model, developers must serialize their work, to avoid problems with different versions.\n\nEvery project has a central repository that is considered as the official repository, which is managed by the project maintainers. Developers clone this repository to create identical local copies of the code base. Source code changes in the central repository are periodically synchronized with the local repository.\n\nThe developer creates a new branch in his local repository and modifies source code on that branch. Once the development is done, the change needs to be integrated into the central repository.\n\nContributions to a source code repository that uses a distributed version control system are commonly made by means of a pull request, also known as a merge request. The contributor requests that the project maintainer \"pull\" the source code change, hence the name \"pull request\". The maintainer has to \"merge\" the pull request if the contribution should become part of the source base.\n\nThe developer creates a pull request to notify maintainers of a new change; a comment thread is associated with each pull request. This allows for focused discussion of code changes. Submitted pull requests are visible to anyone with repository access. A pull request can be accepted or rejected by maintainers.\n\nOnce the pull request is reviewed and approved, it is merged into the repository. Depending on the established workflow, the code may need to be tested before being included into official release. Therefore, some projects contain a special branch for merging untested pull requests. Other projects run an automated test suite on every pull request, using a continuous integration tool such as Travis CI, and the reviewer checks that any new code has appropriate test coverage.\n\nThe first open-source DVCS systems included Arch, Monotone, and Darcs. However, open source DVCSs were never very popular until the release of Git and Mercurial.\n\nBitKeeper was used in the development of the Linux kernel from 2002 to 2005. The development of Git, now the world's most popular version control system, was prompted by the decision of the company that made BitKeeper to rescind the free license that Linus Torvalds and some other Linux kernel developers had previously taken advantage of.\n\n"}

In total, he played 54 league games for the club over three and a half seasons – and helped Odd reach the 2002 Norwegian Cup Final, where they were beaten 1–0 by Vålerenga. His play with Odd Grenland led to interest from various European clubs including Aston Villa, and AC Milan, with which he had a training stint.\n\nSolli joined Rosenborg of Trondheim in the summer of 2003 and made four starts and ten substitute appearances in the second half of that season as the club won a 12th consecutive league title. During his first season with Rosenborg he scored his first-ever league goal against Viking on 23 August 2003, in his fifth full season as a professional footballer. He was also a regular in the ensuing European campaigns for Rosenborg and scored an important first-leg goal against Maccabi Haifa in the UEFA Champions League third qualifying round in August 2004.

The term, coined by \"Manchester Evening News\" journalist Tom Jackson in 1951, usually refers to the players who won the league championship in seasons 1955–56 and 1956–57 with an average age of 21 and 22 respectively.\n\nEight of the players – Roger Byrne (28), Eddie Colman (21), Mark Jones (24), Duncan Edwards (21), Liam Whelan (22), Tommy Taylor (26), David Pegg (22) and Geoff Bent (25) – died in or as a result of the Munich air disaster in February 1958, while Jackie Blanchflower (24 at the time of the crash) and senior player Johnny Berry (31 at the time of the crash) were injured to such an extent that they never played again. Berry was the senior player in the team by the time of the crash, having been signed from Birmingham City in 1951, by which time he was already 25.\n\nA few of the players in the team at this time had actually been bought from other clubs, although one of them, goalkeeper Ray Wood, was just 18 when he joined United from Darlington in 1949. Wood's successor in the first team, Harry Gregg, signed in December 1957, was signed from Doncaster Rovers as the world's most expensive goalkeeper at the time for £23,500. Tommy Taylor had been one of the most expensive players in English footballer when United paid £29,999 for him as a 21-year-old from Barnsley in 1953, whereas Johnny Berry had already been at the club for two years when Taylor arrived.\n\nOther notable \"Busby Babes\" include full-back Bill Foulkes, wingers Kenny Morgans and Albert Scanlon, forward Dennis Viollet, wing-half Wilf McGuinness (who later became manager of Manchester United) and forwards John Doherty, Colin Webster and Eddie Lewis. McGuinness and Webster were not on the plane when it crashed at Munich, whereas Doherty had just been sold to Leicester City.\n\nThe last remaining player from the pre-Munich side, Bobby Charlton (20 at the time of the crash), retired from playing in 1975; though he had left Manchester United two years earlier, he had continued playing as player-manager of Preston North End. As a player, he set the all-time goalscoring record for Manchester United and England, which was later broken by another United player (Wayne Rooney) and his appearance record was unbroken for 35 years after his last game for United, while his England record was not broken until 2015, by the same United player (Wayne Rooney) as he scored his 50th England goal. Bill Foulkes, who retired in 1970, had still been at the club when the European Cup was finally won in 1968. \n\nHarry Gregg had left the club in the 1966–67 season, signing for Stoke City, who had signed Dennis Viollet from United five seasons earlier. Kenny Morgans had moved to Swansea City in 1961, having rarely played for United after the end of the 1957-58 season. Albert Scanlon was sold to Newcastle United in November 1960. Ray Wood had been sold to Huddersfield Town within a year of the Munich crash, having been unable to win back his place in the team from Harry Gregg, leaving Old Trafford around the same time as Colin Webster, who was sold to Swansea Town. Wilf McGuinness suffered a broken leg in a reserve match during the 1959-60 season and never returned to the first team, although he stayed with the club as a member of the coaching staff and spent 18 months as United's manager after the retirement of Sir Matt Busby in May 1969. Injury also ended the career of John Doherty, who played his last game for Leicester City less than a year after United sold him to the East Midlands club.\n\nSammy McIlroy was born in Belfast and moved to Manchester United in 1969 becoming Matt Busby's final signing, he was \"The last of the Busby Babes\".\n\n"}

Located in northern Burgess Hill, it primarily serves the town's neighbourhoods of World's End and Sheddingdean. The station is down the line from via . It is situated between and stations on the main line, and between Haywards Heath and stations on the East Coastway line, which branches off just south of the station at Keymer Junction. The station is managed by Southern which is one of two companies serving Wivelsfield, the other one being Thameslink. Until May 2018, Gatwick Express also served the station with a single early-morning service towards London.\n\nDespite its name, the station is not located in Wivelsfield village, which actually lies approximately to the northeast, in the Lewes District of East Sussex.\n\nThe London Brighton and South Coast Railway opened a station called Keymer Junction on the Lewes line, just beyond the junction, towards the end of 1854, although, it appears that some trains may have called at Keymer Crossing from the completion of the junction in 1847. The station was closed on 1 November 1883 to allow for the proposed remodelling of the junction. However, when the railway later sought Parliamentary authority to abandon their planned changes, they were required to provide a replacement station to the north of the junction on the present site.\n\nThe second Keymer Junction station was opened on 1 August 1886 and retained that name until 1 July 1896 when it was renamed Wivelsfield. Construction of the new station involved widening a narrow, high embankment. Just over two months after it opened, heavy rain caused a landslip which caused a long section of the Up (northbound) platform, and the waiting room building, to collapse and fall down the embankment.\n\nOn 23 December 1899, a serious accident happened here, when a red signal was obscured by thick fog. A train from Brighton collided with a boat train from Newhaven Harbour at , and six passengers were killed and twenty seriously injured. The accident resulted in improvements made to the signalling at Keymer Junction.\n\nThere are three entrances at the station. Two of these are located where the railway line passes over Leylands Road (both on the south side of the road, one on each side of the railway), less than 40 metres apart from each other. Both entrances give access to the platforms via the same subway at the northern end of the station; the easternmost of the two entrances also includes the ticket office. The third entrance of the station is located by the station car park on Gordon Road; it is the only entrance with step-free access (via a ramp) but is directly linked only to platform 2. For this reason, just one of the two platforms is fully wheelchair-accessible.\n\nTrain services are provided by Southern and Thameslink.\n\nThe typical service from the station is:\n\nOn Sundays all London Victoria - Eastbourne trains are extended to Ore.\n\nIn Autumn 2015 Network Rail released the Sussex Area Route Study, where two options for the proposed grade separation of Keymer Junction are detailed, both of which would transform the station dramatically. Option 1 is the minimal option and creates a new platform 0 on the west side of the station served by a 3rd track from the new flyover line from Lewes. Option 2 is much more ambitious and builds on option 1 by adding an additional 4th platform on the east side of the station as well, served by a 4th track on the line to Lewes. Whilst this would enable each line to the south to have a dedicated platform the primary benefit would be that the existing platforms could be used to turn back trains in either direction as needed without blocking the main lines.\n"}

First sold in the UK in 1937, they were originally aimed at women. They have since been sold in Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and, since 2017, the US. The slogan is \"The lighter way to enjoy chocolate\".\n\nMaltesers consist of a spheroid malted milk centre surrounded by milk chocolate. Maltesers are sold in a variety of packaging, including plastic bags (ranging in size from small 'fun-size' upwards), larger cardboard boxes and tubes, and plastic buckets (ranging in size from medium to very large). They also have medium-sized \"teasers\" in Celebrations boxes. Maltesers are also one of the types of chocolate included in Mars's Revels assortment.\n\nMaltesers brand director Rebecca Shepheard-Walwyn called Maltesers “one of the UK’s biggest heritage brands.” A YouGov poll saw them ranked the most popular confectionary in the UK.\n\nMaltesers were created by the American Forrest Mars Sr. in England in 1936, and first sold in 1937. They were originally described as \"energy balls\" and aimed at slimming women.\n\nThe current Maltesers' slogan is \"\"The lighter way to enjoy chocolate\"\". Earlier slogans have included: \"\"The chocolates with the less fattening centre\"\", \"\"No ordinary chocolate\"\" and \"\"Nothing pleases like Maltesers\"\". In the 1930s, advertisements claimed that the Maltesers malted milk centre is one-seventh as fattening as ordinary chocolate centres; this led marketers to claim it was beneficial for weight loss. \n\nIn Australia, Mars signed a production deal with MacRobertson's in 1954, but then switched to Cadbury in 1963.\n\nIn 2011, the product gained Fairtrade accreditation in the UK and Ireland by sourcing all their cocoa and sugar under Fairtrade Terms. In 2016, Maltesers’ commercials in the UK began featuring disabled actors (including \"The Inbetweeners\" actress Storme Toolis) which have been highly successful for the brand. Celebrating universally awkward situations, the adverts were inspired by real-life stories from disabled people.\n\nIn January 2017, Maltesers officially became available in the United States for the first time. The factory in Newmarket, Ontario, Canada produces the Maltesers for the North American market; it is expected the factory exports about 80 percent of its production to the United States.\n\nIn the United Kingdom and Ireland, the ingredients are: sugar, skimmed milk powder, cocoa butter, glucose syrup, barley malt extract, cocoa mass, palm fat, lactose, demineralised whey powder, milk fat, wheat flour, emulsifiers (e442, soya lecithin, e492), palm oil, raising agents (e500, e501, e341), salt, gelling agent (pectin), flavouring.\n\nIn Canada, the ingredients are: sugar, modified milk ingredients, malted milk powder (malted barley, corn syrup, modified milk ingredients, wheat flour, modified and hydrogenated palm oil, sugar, wheat gluten, sodium bicarbonate, potassium bicarbonate, salt), cocoa butter, cocoa mass, corn syrup, palm and palm kernel oil, lactose, malted barley extract, soy lecithin, ammonium salt of phosphorylated glyceride, pectin, sorbitan tristearate, artificial flavour.\n\nIn Australia and New Zealand, the ingredients are: sugar, milk solids, cocoa butter, glucose syrup (sources include wheat), barley malt extract, cocoa mass, vegetable fat, emulsifiers (soy lecithin, 492), wheat gluten, raising agents (501, 500), salt, natural flavour (vanilla extract), pectin.\n\nIn the United States, the ingredients are: sugar, skim milk, cocoa butter, barley malt extract, chocolate, glucose syrup, whey permeate, fractionated palm oil, whey, corn syrup, milkfat, less than 2% - palm oil, palm kernel oil, wheat flour, soy lecithin, sorbitan tristearate (emulsifier), leavening (potassium bicarbonate, monocalcium orthophosphate, baking soda), wheat gluten, lactose, pectin, salt, flavor.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The line is long between Oslo and Stavanger.\n\nThe railway was constructed in several phases, the first section being opened in 1871 and the last not opened until 1944. While there was a continual construction work from Oslo westward as far as Moi, the Jæren Line from Egersund to Stavanger in Western Norway was opened in 1878. Up to 1913 the name used on plans and for the completed sections was the Vestlandet Line (\"The West Country Line\").\n\nThe Sørlandet Line was completed by the German occupation force during World War II. It was opened for regular traffic on 1 May 1944. The line was an important communications link for transportation of troops, as well as war material. Long stretches of the Sørlandet Line railway are set away from the coast, instead of on the more densely populated coastline. One reason for this was to protect the line from invading forces, and also to prevent the line being bombarded by navy ships.\n\nOn 15 November 1950 the Hjuksebø train disaster killed 14 people in a collision between an express train and runaway freight cars. On 15 December 2019 operation of passenger services passed from Vy to Go-Ahead Norge. Since then, Go-Ahead operates its long-haul passenger service between Oslo and Stavanger as \"Sørtoget\" (\"The South Train\").\n\nAmong the stretches which make up the Sørland Line are:\n\nThe Sørlandet Line has one operational branch line, the Arendal Line, which runs between Nelaug and Arendal. Another branch line, the Flekkefjord Line, from Sira to Flekkefjord, was once part of the main line. It was turned into a branch line upon completion of the Sørland Line in 1944, and was finally closed in 1990. Other branch lines which are now closed are the Numedal Line between Kongsberg and Rødberg (in Nore og Uvdal), the Setesdal Line and the Kragerø Line between Neslandsvatn and Kragerø.\n\nKristiansand Station is designed as a terminal station. Therefore, passenger-trains from Stavanger towards Oslo reverse direction when leaving Kristiansand. Freight trains use a direct connection between the eastern and western part of the line outside of Kristiansand, and does not have to change direction at Kristiansand station.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1804774", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1804774", "title": "Park golf", "text": "Park golf\n\nThe founders of the sport wanted to keep it simple so that people of all ages could become parkers easily. A single ball and club are sufficient for a game of park golf. Courses are relatively short and the physical strain of the game is low. The cost of playing is also low and the rules are simple. For this reason, it is a good sport for children and families. Despite this, the majority of the 700,000 parkers continue to be of retirement age.\n\nA \"round\" of park golf is 9 holes. The International Park Golf Association has set upper limits on the length of park golf holes and courses. The maximum length for an individual hole is 100 meters. A 9-hole course is limited to 500 meters or less. Because there is no lower limit, courses can be found in small corners of parks or in the fringe around parking lots.\n\nIt is played using a club similar in appearance to a standard golf driver with a thicker, shorter shaft. The head on a Park Golf club is rarely varied, but the length of stick can change according to the height of the Parker. The club is flat, and only the most skillful Parker can hit the ball in the air.\n\nThe durable plastic resin balls are bright-coloured so they can be easily distinguished from a distance. They come in many colours but are all 60 mm in diameter and less than 100 grams. Balls may be made of a single or multiple components and individual manufactures' balls all perform slightly differently. It is not unusual to see players with several balls for use in different conditions.\n\nAlthough some people carry their balls in their hand between rounds or place it in their pockets, others invest in various ball-carrying devices. The most basic is a moulded length of stainless steel which is attached to the belt or shoelaces. High-end carriers resemble a leather fanny pack and can hold multiple balls, cellular phones, score cards and other personal items.\n\nMost parkers invest in a scorecard holder to protect the scorecard from the elements. Even the most haphazard of players have been known to spend 200 yen on a cheap version of this accessory. The better scorecard holders have a pencil attached.\n\nPark golf uses terminology similar to golf, utilizing words such as par, bogey, eagle and double eagle. To formally play a game of Park Golf, two to four participants are required to form one group. Order is decided by drawing rods that are generally provided by the course management at the beginning of each course. Once initial shooting order is determined, the group decides which course to play on as most parks have 2-4 courses, one course being 9 holes. Multiple courses can be played. Holes can be shot in any order, as long as all holes are played eventually. This occurs most commonly due to a quick group advancing on a slower group of park golfers.\n\nDuring a tournament, rules are that the person to shoot the lowest number of strokes on one hole, goes first the following hole. The highest number of strokes results in going last. Thus, shooting order changes frequently and is something that must be paid attention to. During the game, if a player is having difficulty finishing a hole, rules state that a player may take eight as their score once they exceed this number of strokes and move on.\n\nThe playing field is marked by a green, semi-fairway, fairway, bunkers, rough, and out of bounds. Balls landing out of bounds are replaced to an area on the fairway equal distance from the hole, the player taking two strokes for this mistake instead of playing from where the ball had landed. The player at the end of all accrued courses with the lowest score is the winner.\n\nIn Park Golf, etiquette is based around the principles of enjoyment of the game and enjoyment of nature. \n\nPlayers take care not to damage the greenery and smoking on all courses is forbidden.\n\nStance is the foundation upon which Park Golf shots are constructed. An address behind the ball is used to increase the loft of a shot. Likewise, a forward stance will help keep the ball running along the ground. An open stance offers stability; a closed stance gives precision. This is a difficult choice for a parker and requires decisiveness and concentration.\n\nPlayers are to be considerate of the group behind them by moving off the green once their play is over. Likewise, the group should not enter the next green prior to that group's play being completed. Players are encouraged to continuously check their surroundings to ensure the safety of themselves and others. In addition, players are advised to only give advice when asked in order to avoid meddling.\n\nThere are regular tournaments, with scores as low as 96 for 4 rounds. One unexceptional competitor recently recorded a score of 22 for a round. Tournaments usually cost 1000 yen, which seems expensive, but on reflection is quite cheap when you consider that a box lunch is often included. The winner generally gets an envelope with a small amount of money, and the runners-up get boxes of tissues. Very often the courses are closed because people are having a tournament.\n\nThe Park Golf Association in Japan celebrates August 9 as 'Park Golf Day', in hopes of raising the profile of the game. In Japanese, 8 can be said as \"pa\" and 9 as \"ku\". If put together, it sounds like park.\n\nThe novel \"A Flower Blooms in Poloshiri Park\" was set in Poloshiri Highland Park Golf Course, Hokkaidō, Japan.\n\nAmerican wrestler Dick \"The Destroyer\" Beyer, who spent several years wrestling in Japan, imported the sport of park golf to the United States and opened the first park golf course in the country (in his native Akron, New York) in July 2013.\n\n"}

It functioned as the seat of county government between 1870 and 1965 (when county governments were abolished) and is today a service centre for the central Kennebecasis River valley, as well as being a suburb of Saint John.\n\nThe area in which the town of Hampton is located had been inhabited by French settlers in the 1600s while First Nations had called it home since time immemorial. The United Empire Loyalists however were the first to establish permanent settlements in the area shortly after arriving in 1783. It was in 1785 that Kings County was established in NB and in 1795 the Parish of Hampton was created out of parts of Sussex and Kingston parishes. One area of the town, known now as the Lower Norton Shore, was originally known as the Yankee Shore because of all the Loyalist immigrants in the 1780s. \n\nBy 1871 Hampton had a population of 250. By 1904 it grew to 800 and also included a post office, 3 stores, 3 hotels, a match factory, a grist mill, a saw mill and 3 churches. At this time it also included the community of Hampton Ferry (population 150) and the village of Ossekeag (Hampton Station) which had a population of 500 and was home to a post office, 7 stores, a hotel, a machine shop and 4 churches. It was also the site of a station on the Intercontinental Railway and a junction on the Hampton-St. Martin's railway. The name Ossekeag is Mi'kmaq for \"marshy brook\"\n\nHampton was incorporated as a village in 1966. It became a town in 1991.\n\nHampton is located in the Kennebecasis River valley, where the river flows into a wide flood plain. The Hampton Marshes contain a diverse assortment of wildlife and are one of the town's major tourist attractions. Although Hampton is located far upstream from the Bay of Fundy, its high tides have some effect there nonetheless. The marshes flood every spring during the run-off, and then the water levels vary during the course of the year, offering a constantly changing landscape for different animals, birds and fish. In late years, the marshes have suffered from an invasion of Purple Loosestrife.\n\nThe old Hampton Gaol at , built around 1870, was designated protected in 1976 as a New Brunswick Provincial Historic Site.\n\nThe town of Hampton is the birthplace of: John Peters Humphrey, (one of the drafters of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights); artist and sculptor John Hooper; MLA Bev Harrison; Colin Jardine, bassist for folk punk band, Sleepy PUNK; NHL referee Tim Peel; singer/songwriter Jessica Rhaye; journalist/New Brunswick author Dorothy Dearborn; and journalist/New Brunswick author Stuart D. Trueman.\n\nSteve Fossett once made a crash landing outside Hampton, in an aborted attempt to be the first balloonist to fly solo non-stop around the world. The Solo Challenger departed Stratobowl, South Dakota, on January 8, 1996. Fossett called it \"the most embarrassing day of my life,\" but a woman from the town thought otherwise. Forcing her way through the crowd that gathered, she offered him a miniature Canadian flag. \"Welcome to Canada,\" she said. Fossett sighed wearily and thanked her.\n\nAs the shire town of the county, Hampton is also home to the Kings Co. Museum and Gaol\n\nHampton is administered by an elected mayor and town council. For the term May 2008 to May 2012, the council consists of:\nMayor: Ken Chorley;\nDeputy Mayor: Robert Doucet;\nCouncillors: Dwight Bond, Peter Behr and Todd Beach.\n\nGary Crossman (PC) represents Hampton in the provincial legislature.\n\nAt the federal level, Hampton is located in the riding of Fundy Royal. The current Member of Parliament is Rob Moore of the Conservative Party of Canada.\n\nHampton New Brunswick has four different schools: Dr. A.T. Leatherbarrow Primary School, Hampton Elementary School, Hampton Middle School, and Hampton High School. Their High School is represented by a variety of athletic teams including basketball, soccer, golf, football, hockey, and track and field. Their athletic mascot is the Hampton Husky.\n\nHighways in Hampton include Route 1, Route 100, Route 121, and Route 845. There is a modern roundabout in the town centre.\n\nThe community obtained rail service in 1859 with the opening of the European and North American Railway to Saint John, connecting to Moncton in 1860. Passenger service continued until 1994. The tracks are still in use for freight, as Canadian National Railways operate them as a secondary mainline.

But at doses of 4-10 milligrams users find 5-MeO-MiPT to be a very euphoric and tactile chemical. Its energetic effects can be very strong at high doses, increasing normal heart rate considerably. Sounds can be amplified in perception to a point where synesthetic effects (\"touching or/and tasting sounds\") occur.\n\nOrally, 5-MeO-MiPT is active at 4-6 mg. The drug can also be smoked, but unlike most other tryptamines, this route requires a much higher dosage. 10–20 mg is usually smoked. It typically produces a very strong odor.\n\nSome users report activity as low as 1 mg while others report no activity up to 20 mg, this compound seems to be highly sensitive to the individual and any potential researchers should keep this in mind. Titrating the dose would be especially important with this compound.\n\nSome users report little to no visual activity until doses of 10 mg or higher are taken. This chemical proves very useful for opening up and expressing oneself much like MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) and may be a useful chemical in psychedelic therapy.\n\nThe mechanism that produces the hallucinogenic and entheogenic effects of 5-MeO-MiPT is thought to result primarily from 5-HT receptor agonism, although additional mechanisms of action such as inhibition of MAO may be involved also. 5-MeO-MiPT binds most strongly to 5-HT1A receptors; it also shows fairly strong binding affinity to the SERT and NET, thereby acting as a moderately potent serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. These mechanisms may help explain why there are many anecdotal reports of anti-depressant and anxiolytic effects from modest doses of this compound. For example, SNRIs such as venlafaxine are commonly prescribed to treat depression, and the 5-HT1A agonist buspirone is prescribed primarily for treatment of anxiety.\n\nThe toxicity of 5-MeO-MiPT is not known but as with all research chemicals doses should be carefully weighed on an accurate milligram scale and users should take caution because overdoses are not listed. There are many reports of vasoconstriction with it as well. There is no known documentation of death attributed to the use of 5-MeO-MiPT alone.\n\nAs of October 2015 5-MeO-MiPT is a controlled substance in China.\n\n5-MeO-MiPT is a Class A drug in the United Kingdom as are most ethers of ring-hydroxy tryptamines.\n\n5-MeO-MiPT is unscheduled at the federal level in the United States, but it could be considered an analog of 5-MeO-DiPT, in which case purchase, sale, or possession could be prosecuted under the Federal Analog Act.\n\n\"5-Methoxy-N-methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine\" is a Schedule I controlled substance in the state of Florida making it illegal to buy, sell, or possess in Florida.\n\n5-MeO-MiPT is not scheduled in Canada.\n\n\n"}

It was dedicated to \"\"my friend Nicholas Kilburn\"\". It was first performed at the Birmingham Festival on 1 October 1912, conducted by the composer, with Muriel Foster as the soloist.\nThe text of the work is the 1874 poem \"Ode\" by Arthur O'Shaughnessy, which Elgar set in its entirety. He had been working on the music intermittently since 1903, without a specific commission.\n\nThe words of the poem no doubt appealed to Elgar's nature, as it celebrates the dreaming artist — by 1912, he was established as part of British artistic society, but was ambivalent at best about that society. The mood of the Ode is clear in the first lines, which depict the isolation of the creative artist:\nLater verses celebrate the importance of the artist to his society.\n\nThe music is for the most part reserved and personal, and Elgar quotes his own music several times. Sometimes there is a specific verbal cue: for example, the word \"dreams\" is accompanied by a theme from \"The Dream of Gerontius\", and \"sea-breakers\" by the opening of \"Sea Pictures\". The music also quotes the first and second symphonies, the Violin Concerto, \"Nimrod\" (from the \"Enigma Variations\"), \"Rule, Britannia\" and \"La Marseillaise\". Most of the music is original.\n\nIt was commissioned for, and first performed at, the Birmingham Triennial Music Festival, 1912. Early criticism of the work was directed more at the words than at the music, but it was also dismissed as tawdry and self-centred. It is true that performances are rare, particularly outside England. The self-quotations inevitably bring to mind Strauss's \"Ein Heldenleben\", but with different intent; Elgar is depicting the artist not as hero but as bard.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1804814", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1804814", "title": "Clevedon Court", "text": "Clevedon Court\n\nClevedon Court is a manor house on Court Hill in Clevedon, North Somerset, England, dating from the early 14th century. It is now owned by the National Trust. It is designated as a Grade I listed building.\n\nThe house was built and added to over many years. The great hall and chapel block are the earliest surviving parts of the structure with the west wing being added around 1570, when the windows and decoration of the rest of the building were changed. Further construction and adaptation was undertaken in the 18th century when it was owned by the Elton baronets. The house was acquired by the nation and was given to the National Trust in part-payment for death duties in 1960. The Elton family is still resident in the house, which is now open to the public.\n\nIn addition to the main house, the grounds include a selection of walls and outbuildings, some of which date back to the 13th century. The gardens are listed (Grade II*) on the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.\n\nMuch of the present house was built in the early 14th century by Sir John de Clevedon. There is speculation that it may lie on the site of a Roman building, based on excavations to the south of the house in 1961/62. The house incorporates remnants of a 13th-century building which lie at an angle to the rest of the house. It was situated nearly two miles inland from the parish church of St Andrew, which stands on the coast.\n\nAfter the Norman Conquest of 1066, the manor of Clevedon was granted by the King to Matthew de Mortagne, who in turn granted it to his sub-tenant, Hildebert. It is thought that Sir John was a descendant of either Matthew or Hildebert. Perhaps because of the distance to the parish church, the manor house included a chapel dedicated, in the 1320s, to Saint Peter. The house has undergone considerable change since it was built, almost every century seeing structural alterations, but it still retains many features of a mediaeval manor house.\n\nThe de Clevedon family line ended in 1376, and the manor eventually passed, by marriage, to the Northamptonshire family of Wake, who were Lords of the Manor until 1630. John Wake made major additions to the house in the late 16th century, including a new west wing. The manor was sold by Sir John Wake to Sir John Digby in 1630. Digby's estates were confiscated during the English Civil War, but were recovered after the Restoration by his heir. In 1709 the house was bought by Abraham Elton, a merchant from Bristol.\n\nThe Eltons were a prominent Bristol family, and Abraham 1st was Sheriff of Bristol in 1702, a member of the Society of Merchant Venturers becoming Master in 1708, Mayor of Bristol in 1710, and High Sheriff of Gloucestershire in 1716. He became a member of parliament for the five years preceding his death in 1728. He was created a baronet in 1717 as the first of the Elton baronets. The family wealth originally came from copper and brass (including mining in the Mendip Hills) and other commerce, and property. His descendants, not only at Clevedon, also profited from the slave trade.\n\nSir Abraham Elton was succeeded by four further Sir Abraham Eltons. Sir Abraham Elton, 2nd Baronet, and his son Sir Abraham Elton, 3rd Baronet, were also Sheriff and Mayor of Bristol in their time, and the second Baronet was also MP for Taunton 1722–1727, succeeding to his father's seat of Bristol in 1727 until his own death in 1742, despite being nearly ruined in the South Seas Bubble crisis. The third Baronet died bankrupt, and the estate (which had been entailed to protect it from his creditors) passed in 1761 to his brother, Sir Abraham Isaac Elton, 4th Baronet. He made substantial changes to the house and grounds in the then fashionable Gothic revival style, and was succeeded in 1790 by his son, Sir Abraham Elton, 5th Baronet. He was ordained as a young man, and was a curate in West Bromwich before inheriting the title. He was a supporter of Hannah More, and a fervent opponent of Methodism, at one time inducing the vicar of Blagdon to sack his curate, causing a national scandal. His second wife, Mary, made further alterations to the house in the early 19th century, and also made many improvements to the town, including a school. One of the town's modern primary schools is named after her.\n\nThe line of Abrahams came to an end in 1842 when Sir Charles Abraham Elton, 6th Baronet, succeeded his father. Sir Charles was a writer, and contributed to several periodicals including \"The Gentleman's Magazine\". Sir Charles' sister Julia was married to the historian Henry Hallam, and his nephew Arthur Hallam is buried in the Elton family vault at St Andrew's church. Arthur Hallam is the subject of Alfred Tennyson's poem \"In Memoriam A.H.H.\". Tennyson visited Clevedon Court in 1850, the year in which the poem was published, and also in which he was created Poet Laureate. William Makepeace Thackeray was a visitor to the court during Sir Charles's time and it was the inspiration for the house \"Castlewood\" which featured in his novel \"The History of Henry Esmond\" although, contrary to common belief, it is improbable that he wrote any of it at Clevedon Court. Samuel Taylor Coleridge lived in Clevedon briefly during this period and may have visited the Court.\nSir Arthur Elton, 7th Baronet, inherited the house and title in 1853 and, like his father, was a writer. He resigned as MP for Bath in 1859 and spent the rest of his life improving the town, setting up a lending library and allotments, and building and funding the cottage hospital (still in existence). All Saints' Church, near the Court, was built in 1860 on the orders of Sir Arthur, and he also made additions to the fabric of the Court itself. The West Wing of the house was largely destroyed by a fire in 1882. It was rebuilt, with C. E. Davis as the architect. During these building works, the chapel was rediscovered, the East window having been filled and altar broken off (perhaps during the English Protestant Reformation), and the room having been known until then as the \"Lady's Bower\".\n\nSir Edmund Elton, 8th Baronet, nephew and son-in-law of Sir Arthur, inherited the estate and title in 1883. He was an enthusiastic voluntary fireman, and inventor of one of the first forked bicycle brakes, as well as a device to prevent ladies' skirts from becoming entangled in bicycle wheels. He was also a well-known potter, setting up his \"Sunflower Pottery\" in the Court grounds with the help of a local boy called George Masters. \"Elton ware\" became popular, especially in America where it was marketed by Tiffany & Co. Elton and Masters' work typically has a variety of rich colours, bas-relief decoration of flowers in a style similar to Art Nouveau, and in the later works metallic glazes are often used.\nSir Edmund's son Sir Ambrose succeeded him in 1920. His son Sir Arthur was one of the pioneers of documentary film making in the years prior to, during and after the Second World War, working with John Grierson. He inherited the title on his father's death in 1951. The house was acquired by the Nation, and was given to the National Trust, in part-payment of death duties, in 1960. The West Wing was immediately demolished, being considered to have no architectural or historical significance, to reduce running costs and to return the house to its supposed mediaeval ground plan. Sir Arthur died in 1973 and was succeeded by his son Sir Charles. The Elton family is still resident in the house, which is now open to the public.\n\nThe site faces south, with its back to Court Hill, and the road may have passed east-west within of the front door. The great hall, screens passage, porches and chapel blocks have all survived from the early 14th century and the square headed chapel windows contain reticulated tracery of the decorated period. These buildings were probably complete by 1322 although the parapets of the porches and chapel may have been remodelled at a later date. The 14th-century building embodied older structures including a small four-storey tower that dates, perhaps, to the mid to late 13th century, and the building that became the 14th-century kitchen (now the museum) was probably the earlier hall.\n\nAlterations during the late mediaeval period were limited to the addition of a two-storey latrine tower at the rear of the house and some rearrangement of the rooms around it. In about 1570 a substantial west wing was added, adjoining and parallel to the solar wing. Apparently typical of its period, it would have transformed the living arrangements of the Wake family who built it. Presumably at the same time, the front of the solar block and east wing were \"Elizabethanised\" with new windows, and the gable end of the kitchen block at the eastern end was decorated with finials.\n\nThere is little evidence of the building work that must have been done in the early 1700s following a period of near-disuse and it may have been restricted to repairs. Substantial alterations in the 1760s and 1770s included the replacement and repitching of the great hall roof, the new gothic south window of the great hall complete with the ogee parapet above it and the provision of a ceiling within the hall. At the same time, the west wing façade was remodelled in \"Chinese Gothic\" style.\n\nSir Arthur Elton (7th Bt) began updating the house before 1850 (and the lodge at the gate dates from 1851) but it was in 1860s that he made major changes. The west wing was extended and remodelled, this time with an Elizabethan style façade. Less obvious alterations to the east end (where the servants lived and worked) probably also date to this period. The fire of 1882 destroyed much of the western end of the house. In the rebuilding that followed, an even larger west end was constructed but Sir Arthur took pains to ensure that its Elizabethan south front was conserved and retained. Postcards of Clevedon reveal that the last change to the great hall window was made in about 1912, when it was given a square head again, in Elizabethan style.\n\nIn the late 1950s, when the National Trust agreed to take on the house, the Victorian west wing (but not its Elizabethan south front) were demolished as were a plethora of minor 18th- and 19th-century buildings at the rear. The new west front was given a stonework façade and incorporated the Elizabethan south front.\n\nIn the grounds, the only certain survivor from the medieval period is the small crenellated drum tower. Its original purpose is unknown. It adjoins a substantial wall that may also have origins in the 13th century. The other garden walls have unknown dates of origin but mostly pre-date around 1730, when the stables were built. All of the other buildings, including the lodge at the South entrance (1851) are Georgian or Victorian. The medieval appearance of the eastern barn resulting from incorporation of stone from the former medieval barn that stood in front of the house.\n\nAn early picture of the court shows a building known as Wake's Tower on Court Hill. It is included in Saxton's map of 1570 but was demolished before 1738. Towers such as this were popular Elizabethan features and were lookouts or summer houses. A summerhouse was built on the site but this too was in ruins by the early 19th century.\n\nThe central and largest room in the house is the great hall which was the original dining room and the accompanying screens passage which gave access to the hall from the service rooms. The staircase to the north of the hall was added in the 18th century. The state room on the western side of the first floor was damaged by fire in 1882; the oak panelling around the fireplace was brought from the Eltons' former house in Queen Square, Bristol. The chapel on the first floor has a rectangular window with reticulated tracery, which dominates the front of the house. The stained glass in the window was added after the 1882 fire. The justice room has had a variety of uses but takes its name from its function as the manorial court until the 18th century. The house contains many family portraits and other pictures as well as collections of Eltonware and Nailsea Glass and prints of bridges and railways.\n\nThe gardens of Clevedon Court are listed (Grade II*) on the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.\n\nNestling at the foot of Court Hill, on a sheltered south-facing site largely protected from the winds which blow off the Bristol Channel, the front lawns of Clevedon Court run gently down to the perimeter wall. The bulk of the house conceals the dramatic architectural quality of the garden behind, carved out of the hillside in a series of terraces, which rise steeply back to merge with the woodland above. They are surrounded by what Gertrude Jekyll described as \"One of the noblest ranges of terrace walls in England.\"\nAlthough a court roll of 1389 mentions two gardens, there is no record of where these were sited, nor is there any record of when the terraces were constructed. The basic layout as known today was certainly in place by about 1730, as can be seen in a portrait of the house from that period. Later in the 18th century, the space behind the great pilastered wall was infilled to make the top terrace, which has wide views across the valley to the Mendip Hills beyond. The Octagon, a garden pavilion, was built about the same time, as was the more rustic summer house which faces it down the long grassy walk of the Pretty Terrace. Further modifications involved facing the lower retaining wall with rosy pink bricks, which were also used to build a double flight of steps below the Octagon. The garden is still largely in its 18th-century form, though small ponds and fountains were added in the 19th century and the once open hillside behind is now thickly wooded. A single rose arbour remained from the Edwardian garden but was on the verge of collapse when it was replaced with a new one in 2009, marking 300 years of the Elton family's presence at Clevedon Court.\n\nVery little is known about the mid-18th century planting, although there remains, in front of the house, a gnarled black mulberry tree, which was described as ancient in 1822. However, 19th-century drawings and photographs record increasingly elaborate and fussy bedding schemes, finally swept away in the 1960s. Today there is a more informal style, emphasising the architectural character of the garden with its long straight sweeps of wall; it is also an easier style to maintain. In recent years, native wild plants have been allowed to mingle with rare and exotic specimens and continual thought is being given to contrasting textures and colours of foliage. The lower garden, below the front of the house, now has the air of a small arboretum with a number of fine specimen trees, such as a splendid late-leafing catalpa (an oriental plane tree) dominates this part of the garden and the grass at its foot is left uncut during the Spring, allowing camassias and bluebells to make a fine showing.\n\nAs with many English gardens, this one is at its best in May and June, when the magnolias are in bloom and luxurious plants, such as peonies and alliums, are flowering. An ongoing initiative is being made to put in plants which provide interest throughout the season or are at their best in the late summer. There are now many species and colours of lavender and plenty of agapanthus, crinum, nerines and day lilies, together with such rarities as a Heptacodium and an Arbutus menziesii.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1804817", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1804817", "title": "Young Friends General Meeting", "text": "Young Friends General Meeting\n\nYoung Friends General Meeting (YFGM) is the national organisation for young Quakers (from 18 to 30-ish) in the United Kingdom. The name refers both to the organisation and to the General Meetings which are held in February, May and October each year, in various Quaker Meeting Houses in Britain. The organization also publishes a tri-annual magazine entitled The Young Quaker.\n\nThe Young Friends Movement in the United Kingdom emerged in the first decade of the twentieth Century, inspired by John Wilhelm Rowntree and led by Neave Brayshaw. The first National Conference of Young Friends was held in August 1911. Among the first generation were many conscientious objectors, who suffered badly during the Great War. \n\nThe movement has influenced Britain Yearly Meeting strongly during the twentieth century, for instance on the issue of ethical investments. \n\nThe name changed from Young Friends Central Committee to the present name in 1993. \n\nIn 1998, YFGM gave the annual Swarthmore Lecture to Friends gathered at Yearly Meeting in London, with the title \"Who do we think we are? Young Friends' Commitment and Belonging\".\n\nPerhaps summing up its work is a statement from 1926: 'Our work is based on the thought that 'What you have inherited from your forefathers, you must acquire for yourselves to possess it'. That is to say that each generation of Young Friends by its experiments must discover for itself the truths on which the Society is built, if it is to use those truths, and to continue and enlarge the work of the Society. Hence the occasional separate meetings of younger Friends and our desire to have means of expressing corporately our own experience' (\"Quaker Faith & Practice\", 21.04)\n\nYoung Friends General Meeting is represented on various Quaker bodies in the United Kingdom, including two representatives on Meeting for Sufferings.\n\nYoung Friends General Meeting arranges several events each year. In addition to three General Meetings and three Planning Weekends annually, smaller groups of YFGM members often arrange smaller local or themed events.\n\nForemost among these are the General Meetings, which take place at a Meeting House somewhere in Britain three times each year, usually in February, May, and October. These are residential weekend events with most participants sleeping in the Meeting House. These events are the main venue for conducting the business of the meeting, and also serve as spiritual gatherings, and act as the hub of the community. In addition to conducting the business of the organisation, these events usually include a range of activities, including sessions with a focus on spirituality, external speakers, and the opportunity to join with local Friends for Meeting for Worship.\n\nSmaller events, Planning Weekends, which take place around six weeks before General Meetings, serve a dual purpose. Primarily, they exist to plan the proceedings of the General Meeting held in the following month. They also serve as a venue for the meeting of committees, encouraging cooperation and awareness between them.\n\nHistorically, YFGM was responsible for Pardshaw Young Friends' Centre and regularly held gatherings there. However, in 2008 YFGM agreed to hand over responsibility for Pardshaw to West Cumbria Area Meeting.\n\nThese events, which are YFGM events without the business, are usually organised by small groups of YFGM participants on a specific theme, or simply to enjoy each other's company. Previous events have included a theme of mental wellbeing, and a retreat at Yealand Meeting House.\n\n\"The Young Quaker\" (\"TYQ\") is a magazine produced three times each year by Young Friends General Meeting since 2013. Previously known as \"Young Quaker\" and published monthly, it provides a forum for religious, social, environmental and other issues. It lists national and international events as well as changes of address and other notices. Because it is the magazine of Young Friends General Meeting, \"Young Quaker\" is primarily aimed at people between the ages of 18 and 30. The magazine is also read by young people under 18. Writer Charlie Brooker stated that the magazine \"largely consisted of poetry and people wearing sensible hand-knitted jumpers.\"\n\nWhile its predecessor, \"Young Quaker\" was sold predominantly on a subscription only basis, \"The Young Quaker\" is free at YFGM events and by request from the YFGM Office. It is also available to read online on its own website.\n\nThe magazine has five editors which are appointed by Young Friends General Meeting, having been discerned by YFGM's Nominations Committee. Co-editors are usually appointed for a period of three years.\n\n\"The Young Quaker\" was started in 1922, as a natural development from the Young Friends movement. It stopped after a couple of years and resurfaced in the mid 1930s as a quarterly European publication. It went to ground again and then came back in the 1940s during the second world war as a London news sheet for young Friends. In 1956 production began regularly under the title \"Young Quaker\" and the magazine was published continuously until 2011. A full archive of can be found in the library at Friends House.\n\n\n"}

He died at age 31, in broken health, having published the year prior—anonymously—a collection of essays and aphorisms with the encouragement of Voltaire, his friend. He first received public notice under his own name in 1797, and from 1857 on, his aphorisms became popular. In the history of French literature, his significance lies chiefly in his friendship with Voltaire (20 years his senior).\n\nHe was born in Aix-en-Provence into the nobility, but his family was poor. He spent his youth at the family seat, Chateau of Vauvenargues. Frail health prevented him from pursuing any but minimal schooling; he did not study Latin or Greek. He also suffered poor eyesight. In boyhood, he became friends with Victor Riqueti, marquis of Mirabeau (born 1715), father of the future French Revolution figure, Mirabeau, and with the future archaeologist, Jules-François-Paul Fauris de Saint-Vincens (born 1718), with both of whom he would correspond avidly once he left home.\n\nIn the France of that age, the only occupations considered proper for a nobleman were in the military or the church. At age 17 or 18, Vauvenargues embarked on a career in the military, as a cadet in the King's Regiment. By 1739, he had achieved the rank of lieutenant; later, he was promoted to captain. In 1740, he met a fellow officer, an adolescent about nine years his junior, Paul Hippolyte Emmanuel de Seytres, who became a permanent object of the author's devotion. The two were part of the disastrous Siege of Prague (1742), the expedition to Bohemia in support of Frederick II of Prussia's designs on Silesia, in which the French were abandoned by their ally. Seytres died in the spring, at the age of seventeen. The future author's fascination for the boy persisted for the remaining five years of his own life. He addressed his philosophical work, \"Conseil à un jeune homme (Advice to a young Man)\" to Seytres and labored on a funeral eulogy for him, a work which Vauvenargues considered to be among the most important of his life and which he continued to polish until his own death. The Siege of Prague ruined Vauvenargues physically. In December, when half the army was conducted in a strategic retreat, his legs froze, and though he spent a long time in hospital at Nancy he never completely recovered. He was present at the battle of Dettingen, and on his return to France was garrisoned at Arras. He retired from the army.\n\nHe began corresponding with Voltaire in April 1743. He was encouraged to turn to literature by his friend the marquis of Mirabeau, author of \"L'Ami des Hommes\", and father of the statesman. Wishing to enter the diplomatic service, for two years he made applications to ministers and to king Louis XV himself. These efforts were unsuccessful, but Vauvenargues nevertheless came close to securing a diplomatic appointment, thanks to the intervention of Voltaire. But he contracted smallpox, which disfigured him, rendered him nearly blind, and left him with a chronic cough. Voltaire then asked him to submit to him his ideas on the difference between Jean Racine and Pierre Corneille. Their acquaintance ripened into a deep friendship.\n\nVauvenargues managed to move to Paris in 1745, where he lived as a recluse. Among the few people he socialized with were Jean-François Marmontel and Voltaire. He continued to correspond with Fauris de Saint-Vincens. In 1746 he published—anonymously—his sole volume, a collection of writing including \"Introduction à la connaissance de l'esprit humain\", with \"Reflexions\" and \"Maximes\" appended. Voltaire implored him to publish a second edition of the book with improved diction. It was published in the year of his death (different sources disagree on whether he lived to see the publication of the second edition).\n\nHe died in Paris on 28 May 1747.\n\nIn childhood, he developed a great admiration for the work of the ancient Greek writer Plutarch.\n\nDespite the scantiness of Vauvenargues's oeuvre, it has attracted considerable interest. A century after his death, Schopenhauer favorably quoted several of Vauvenargues sayings, including: \"la clarté est la bonne foi des philosophes\" [clarity is the good faith of philosophers], from \"Reflections and Maxims\", 729], and: \"personne n'est sujet a plus de fautes que ceux qui n'agissent que par reflexion\" [none are so prone to make mistakes as those who act only on reflection].\n\nThe chief distinction between Vauvenargues and his predecessor François de La Rochefoucauld is that Vauvenargues thinks nobly of man, and is altogether inclined rather to the Stoic than to the Epicurean theory. He has been called a modern Stoic.\n\n\n"}

The series was created by Jean Chalopin along with Diane Eskenazi (Golden Films) and Avi Arad (Toy Biz chairman, CEO and the founder of Marvel Studios) who were also executive producers of the series, which lasted for two seasons of 13 episodes each. Its first episode aired on September 13, 1992, and the last episode was on December 12, 1993. It aired as part of Bohbot's \"Amazin' Adventures\" programming block.\n\nThe show's premise had King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table trapped in the Cave of Glass by Arthur's sister, the evil enchantress Queen Morgana. The wizard Merlin, unable to free King Arthur and the Knights himself, searches the timeline for replacement Knights. He finds the quarterback of the New York Knights football team, Arthur King, and transports him and his teammates to Camelot after one of their football games. He appoints Arthur King as their leader, with his teammates as the new Knights of the Round Table, and assigns them the task of freeing the true King and Knights. To do so, they must find the Twelve Keys of Truth, one for each knight that only the knight in question can initially touch. Once all the keys are found, the real knights will be free and the team will return home. In the meantime, they pledge \"fairness to all, to protect the weak and vanquish the evil\". The Knights are armed with special armor and are able to summon their respective creatures at any time when in battle armor. These animals, such as King Arthur's dragon, are emblazoned on their shields.\n\nThe series had a progressive story with both sides advanced towards their goals. Continuity was also established in the episodes which would be brought up in later episodes, along with some repeat minor characters, character relationships, and previously overcome weaknesses of the Knights. Despite the continual movement towards a resolution, the series is incomplete and ended abruptly during the second season.\n\n\n\n\n\nA video game based on the series was produced by Enix for the Super NES platform in 1995. The game features a final confrontation between King Arthur and Morgana, in the form of a giant dragon, providing a finale to the series where the Knights football team were able to return to their own time.\n\nMattel released a handful of 5\" action figures and vehicles/accessories based on the show. Marvel Comics released a three-part comic book miniseries written by Mike Lackey in 1993.\n\nMaximum Entertainment released the complete series of \"King Arthur and the Knights of Justice\" on Region 2 DVD in the UK. In 2010, after several various partial VHS and DVD releases, Image Entertainment released the complete series as a boxed set in North America with all 26 episodes in a three-DVD set \"King Arthur and the Knights of Justice: The Complete Animated Series\".\n\nFor some time during late 2000s, the whole series has been made available for free watching through Internet streaming at the Lycos' SyncTV service and on Kidlet. Between 2012 and 2014, it has been also available for instant streaming on Netflix. In 2016, Golden Films released it via Amazon.com. As of 2019, the series is available from the subscription service Watch It Kid!.\n\nThe show has been ranked first on the lists of \"The 10 Most Ridiculous Adaptations of Arthurian Legend\" (2009) and the \"8 Mostly Forgotten '90s Cartoons\" (2011) by website Topless Robot, as well as \"15 Most WTF Adaptations Of King Arthur\" by ScreenRant in 2017. Conversely, writer Mark McCray gave it a positive review \"thanks to Chalopin's creative touches, which included a great premise, exceptional storytelling, and beautifully drawn animated characters.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1804835", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1804835", "title": "Super Touring", "text": "Super Touring\n\nSuper Touring, Class 2 or Class II was a motor racing Touring Cars category defined by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) for national touring car racing in 1993. It was based on the \"2 litre Touring Car Formula\" created for the British Touring Car Championship (BTCC) in 1990. The FIA organised a World Cup for the category each year from 1993 to 1995, and adopted the term \"Super Tourer\" from 1995.\n\nSuper Touring replaced Group A as the norm in nearly every touring car championship across the world, but escalating costs, and the withdrawal of works teams caused the category to collapse in the late 1990s. The cars looked like regular production road cars, while expensive changes had to be made to provide space for racing tyres inside the standard wheel arches.\n\nAn example for this was the German Super Tourenwagen Cup (STW) series, which ran from 1994 to 1999, filling a void left after the end of the 2.5-litre V6-powered Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft (DTM) in 1996. In 2000, the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters (keeping the 'DTM' acronym) resumed with 4.0-litre V8-powered cars.\n\nThe Super Touring cars were required to be a minimum of in length, with four doors, effectively requiring a small family saloon car as a minimum. No more than 2 litres engine capacity, or six cylinders were permitted, and the engine was required to be naturally aspirated. Only two wheels could be driven and steered. For homologation, initially at least 2500 units of the model used must have been produced. In 1995, in a bid to counter the increasing numbers of homologation specials this number was increased to at least 25,000 units.\n\nThere was no restriction on body size and doors until 1993, when it was changed to only allow cars with a minimum of four doors and no smaller than the EuroNCAP 'Small Family Car' class, although 'Large Family Car' tends to dominate the category. Until 1995, teams were only permitted to fit aerodynamic device that were available through dealers, but that changed when, in 1994 BTCC season, Alfa Romeo entered a 155 with Gabriele Tarquini and Giampiero Simoni as drivers. The car had a front spoiler with a bottom piece that could be unscrewed and moved forward, acting as a splitter, and a rear spoiler with a pair of extensions, giving the car more downforce. When Alfa Romeo won the first five rounds, Ford, supported by Vauxhall, made a complaint to the race stewards. TOCA soon decided the aero devices were illegal and Alfa Romeo were stripped of the points they earned at Snetterton and Silverstone (although this decision was later reversed by appeal) and in return, walked out from the Oulton Park race. After this point, Alfa were forced to run their spoilers in the retracted position (the position in which the spoilers were fitted on the road going version, the Alfa 155 Silverstone – of which only 2,500 cars were homologated to allow the use of the aerodynamic devices and higher rev limits for a 1.8-litre car – though the road car was sold with two unfitted spoiler extension brackets). In the meantime, Renault and BMW responded by introducing their own limited edition road cars (Laguna Airflow and 318is, respectively) to enable them to run with oversized aerodynamic aids; Renault would win the Oulton Park race that Alfa Romeo had walked out. Soon after that, the FIA changed the regulation in all series to increase minimum number of produced road cars for homologation to 25,000, and allowing cars to only use non-production aerodynamic devices with a restricted size. Restrictions varied depending on body type, with Volvo having to revert from the 850 Estate to their four-door saloon model the following season when they found themselves to be disadvantaged by the new rules. In the Italian Supertourismo category, teams entered extended spoilers without complaints.\n\nSome series however, would change the rules to suit crowd demands, and competition from rival series, one example, was the Japanese Touring Car Championship (JTCC), which made increases to body width and exhaust noise while restricting front aerodynamic devices in 1997 (which allowed Toyota to use the larger Toyota Chaser); it ultimately backfired when Nissan and Honda left the series at the end of season, leaving Toyota as the only manufacturer that competed. In 1999, a new formula using spaceframe cars came to nothing, and the series was abandoned altogether, as by then Japan's big three all had works entries in the then-JGTC.\n\nIn Australia, the series began in 1993 when the Group A regulations for the Australian Touring Car Championship series was replaced by Supercars Group 3A Formula (known as V8 Supercars from 1997 onwards) and Super Touring. The advent of a new management structure and telecast arrangement for V8 Supercars put them in conflict with Bathurst 1000 organisers. Super Touring were offered the chance to compete at Bathurst after race organisers could not come to terms with V8 Supercars. Bathurst City Council and V8 Supercars came to a separate arrangement to host their own breakaway \"Australian 1000 Classic\" race. Super Touring did not become a viable option, and the third and final race was transformed into a motorsport carnival, with several categories attending and the Super Touring event halved to , before collapsing in the aftermath of the 1999 race. In 2000, in the absence of a rival, the V8 Supercars event took up the Bathurst 1000 name.\n\nUnfortunately, during the Super Touring's long run, the category suffered two fatal accidents. In 1995, Gregg Hansford at Phillip Island, and Kieth O'dor at Avus, were involved in fatal accidents as a result of a broken neck caused by their cars' being hit side-on. Soon after, rollcages in competition cars with built-in side impact bars, and seats with head restraints on the side would become mandatory.\n\nOne reason for Super Touring's demise was the cost of preparing a car for competition. In 1990, a Vauxhall Cavalier cost £60,000. By the later part of the 90's, a similar car with more sophisticated aerodynamics device and telemetry cost £250,000.\n\nThe later World Touring Car Championship regulations are very inspired by the old series, with production-based four-door saloons powered by 2.0-litre engines. Wider wheel arches are allowed, which makes the cars look more spectacular. Cars under S2000 regulations are cheaper than their predecessors, to which serious modifications had to be made to allow for wider tires, lower ride height and different suspension – as the width of Super 2000 cars does not need to be the same as that of the production models, development costs can be kept lower. Various national championships use similar rules.\n\nAlthough it bears no resemblance to its predecessor, the \"Super Touring\" name was retained by the Championnat de France de Supertourisme for their 3.0-litre tube frame cars.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1804849", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1804849", "title": "Orthomolecular psychiatry", "text": "Orthomolecular psychiatry\n\nOrthomolecular psychiatry is the use of orthomolecular medicine for mental illness. The approach uses unorthodox forms of individualized testing and diagnosis to attempt to establish an etiology for each patient's specific symptoms, and claims to tailor the treatment accordingly, using a combination of nutrients, dietary changes and medications that are claimed to enhance quality of life and functionality as well as to reduce or eliminate symptoms and the use of xenobiotic drugs. Orthomolecular psychiatry has been rejected by the mainstream medical community.\n\nOrthomolecular psychiatry began with Abram Hoffer and Humphry Osmond in the 1950s and was continued by Carl Pfeiffer, although proponents of orthomolecular psychiatry say that the ideas behind their approach can be traced back to the 1920s and '30s. Orthomolecular psychiatry's goal of weaning patients from conventional neuroleptic drugs follows \"Pfeiffer's Law\", \"For every drug that benefits a patient, there is a natural substance that can achieve the same effect\". In 1968, Linus Pauling first used the term \"orthomolecular\".\n\nHoffer's therapies focused on using niacin, among other nutrients, to treat what he diagnosed as acute schizophrenia based on an unaccepted test. In 1973, a task force of the American Psychiatric Association examined niacin monotherapy of patient populations with chronic schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and rejected the practice along with the reliability of Hoffer's diagnostic approach.\n\nThe assertions by proponents of orthomolecular psychiatry were rejected in 1973 by a panel of the American Psychiatric Association. However, the underpinning ideas of orthomolecular psychiatry have become popular in alternative medical circles as a means to explain conditions such as autism, heavy metal toxicity, and chronic inflammatory disease. After 1975, orthomolecular psychiatry research was primarily reported in \"Orthomolecular Psychiatry\", now the \"Journal of Orthomolecular Medicine\", a publication founded by Hoffer to counter what he considered to be a medical conspiracy against his ideas.\n\nProponents of orthomolecular psychiatry claim to have identified the causes of some psychiatric syndromes, in particular those that cause psychosis; according to orthomolecular proponents, testing for these causes guides diagnosis and treatment. Diagnostic measures and therapies commonly employed include \"individual biochemical workup\", fasting, identifying suggested allergies, dietary changes, megavitamin therapy, amino acids, and other so-called \"pharmacologic nutrients\". These diagnoses have not been accepted by mainstream medicine.\n\nNeurological Disorders\n\"Defects in vitamin B6 metabolism may contribute to some types of neurological abnormalities, because of the involvement of PLP in numerous key pathways of neural functions (namely neurotransmitter synthesis, amino acid metabolism, sphingolipid biosynthesis, and degradation).\".\n\nOrthomolecularists claim that the causes of psychotic disorders include food allergy, hypoglycemia, hypothyroidism in the presence of normal thyroid values, heavy metal intoxications including those allegedly due to dental fillings, as well as several hypothesised conditions they call \"pyroluria\", \"histadelia\" and \"histapenia\". These conditions are said to be not recognized by the conventional medical community though over 400 medical practitioners are said to have attended practitioner education workshops worldwide.\n\n\"Pyroluria\" (or \"malvaria\" from the term \"mauve factor\") involves hypothetical excessive levels of pyrroles in the body resulting from improper hemoglobin synthesis. Carl Pfeiffer believed that pyroluria is a form of schizophrenic porphyria, similar to acute intermittent porphyria where both pyrroles and porphyrins are excreted in the human urine to an excessive degree. and orthomolecular psychiatrists have alleged that pyroluria is related to diagnoses of ADHD, alcoholism, autism, depression, down syndrome, manic-depression, schizophrenia, celiac disease, epilepsy, and psychosis. Pfeiffer's methods have not been rigorously tested, and pyrroles are not considered to be related to schizophrenia. Studies have either failed to detect hemopyrrole and kryptopyrrole in the urine of normal controls and schizophrenics, or found no correlation between these chemicals and mental illness. Few, if any, medical experts regard the condition as genuine, and few or no articles on pyroluria are found in modern medical literature; the approach is described as \"snake oil\" by pediatrician and author Julian Haber.\n\n\"Histadelia\" is a condition hypothesised by Carl Pfeiffer to involve elevated serum levels of histamine and basophils, which he says can be treated with methionine and vitamin B megadoses. Pfeiffer claims that \"histadelia\" can cause depression with or without psychosis, but no published clinical trials have tested the effectiveness of this therapy.\n\n\"Histapenia\" in orthomolecular medicine is the condition of high serum copper with low histamine.\n\nOrthomolecular psychiatry has been rejected by the mainstream medical community. Critics have noted that the claims advanced by its proponents are unsubstantiated, and even false. Authoritative bodies such as the National Institute of Mental Health and American Academy of Pediatrics have criticized orthomolecular treatments as ineffective and toxic.\n\nA 1973 task force of the American Psychiatric Association charged with investigating orthomolecular claims concluded:\nThis review and critique has carefully examined the literature produced by megavitamin proponents and by those who have attempted to replicate their basic and clinical work. It concludes in this regard that the credibility of the megavitamin proponents is low. Their credibility is further diminished by a consistent refusal over the past decade to perform controlled experiments and to report their new results in a scientifically acceptable fashion. Under these circumstances this Task Force considers the massive publicity which they promulgate via radio, the lay press and popular books, using catch phrases which are really misnomers like \"megavitamin therapy\" and \"orthomolecular treatment,\" to be deplorable.\n\nOne review suggested the APA statement was \"well-intentioned\" but biased, and called for further research in this field.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1804871", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1804871", "title": "Louver", "text": "Louver\n\nA louver (American English) or louvre (British English; see spelling differences) is a window blind or shutter with horizontal slats that are angled to admit light and air, but to keep out rain and direct sunshine. The angle of the slats may be adjustable, usually in blinds and windows, or fixed.\n\nLouvers originated in the Middle Ages as lantern-like constructions in wood that were fitted on top of roof holes in large kitchens to allow ventilation while keeping out rain and snow. They were originally rather crude constructions consisting merely of a barrel. Later they evolved into more elaborate designs made of pottery, taking the shape of faces where the smoke and steam from cooking would pour out through the eyes and mouth, or into constructions that were more like modern louvers, with slats that could be opened or closed by pulling on a string.\n\nModern louvers are often made of aluminum, metal, wood, or glass. They may be opened and closed with a metal lever, pulleys, or through motorized operators. The Standard specifies requirements for the construction of buildings using louver in bushfire-prone areas in order to improve their resistance to bushfire attack from burning embers, radiant heat, flame contact and combinations of the three attack forms. The revised building standard details various construction methods and materials that must be used depending on the homes level of bushfire risk. This includes changes to the window and glazing requirements for homes located in a Bushfire Attack Level category greater BAL-Low.\n\nOften used interchangeably by mistake, the key difference between louvers and jalousies is that louvers are fixed position. Jalousies are installed within a movable adjustable mechanism which positions all jalousies into any parallel position with respect to each other.\n\nLouvers are rarely seen as primary design elements in the language of modern architecture, but rather simply a technical device. Louvers are part of the design of Demerara windows to help keep 18th and 19th century buildings cool in hot climates and block direct sunlight. Some modern louver systems serve to improve indoor daylighting. Fixed mirrored louver systems can limit glare and of redirect diffuse light. Such louvers may be integrated in between two panes of double glazing. In industrial facilities such as steel foundries and power plants, louvers are very common. They are utilized for natural ventilation and temperature control.\n\nLouvers are frequently found in bell towers, where they are utilised to let out as much sound as possible, while having the bells remain unexposed to the weather.\n\nLouvers may be used as a type of flood opening, usually covered by one or more moving flaps. They are designed to allow floodwaters to enter and leave the building, equalizing hydrostatic pressure on the walls and mitigating structural damage due to flooding. Louver windows are a staple in the design of homes and perfect to withstand the pressures of future cyclonic conditions. Cyclone homes have always been synonymous with louver windows, louver blades have been tested for ‘debris type B’ for cyclonic regions.\n\nLouvers are used as semi-passive means of thermal control on spacecraft as well.\n\nRear window louvers are also available as an accessory for some automobiles.\n\nLouvers may also be used on traffic light lenses to prevent traffic from seeing the wrong traffic signal.\n\nLouvers are used for different purposes in electronics. \n\nBased on the design of the electronic device, a majority of the electronic devices that have them are laptops. They are less likely seen in desktops, where the design of the airflow vents are usually circular holes. \n\nThe majority of laptops that use louvers are workstation or gaming laptops, where there is a higher need of air flow, than other laptops. The louvers are usually situated near the internal fans. Majority of the time, laptop manufacturers call these louvers \"fan louvers\". \n\nThere are examples of architects who use louvers as part of the overall aesthetic effect of their buildings. The most well-known example is Finnish modernist architect Alvar Aalto who would create aesthetic effects in the facades of his buildings through the combination of different types and sizes of louvers, some fixed some moveable, and made mostly from wood (e.g., the various buildings of the Helsinki University of Technology). A second example, taking influence from Aalto, is the second-generation modernist architect Juha Leiviskä.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1804872", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1804872", "title": "Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland", "text": "Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland\n\nThe Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI; ) is a professional association and educational institution that is responsible for the medical speciality of surgery throughout the island of Ireland. Uniquely among the four mutually recognised royal surgical colleges in the United Kingdom and Ireland, it also incorporates a medical school, which is now Ireland's largest with over 3,000 students from 60 countries. Since 2019 the body has had full university status, making it the first private university in Ireland.\n\nRCSI's main campus is situated on St. Stephen's Green in Dublin, having received its royal charter in 1784. At present, it incorporates schools of medicine, pharmacy, physiotherapy and nursing, and thus provides both undergraduate and postgraduate levels of education and research activities in a number of healthcare fields.\n\nIn the Times Higher Education 2020 impact rankings, RCSI was ranked number one in the world under the category of “good health and well-being”.\n\nSince medieval times, the practice of surgery was licensed by the Barber-Surgeons' Guild, also known at the time as the Guild of St Mary Magdalene. The guild chapel was in Christ Church Cathedral. Guild membership at that time was obtained by a 3-year apprenticeship followed by 2 years as a master. In fact the College of Surgeons maintained a mandatory period of apprenticeship to a qualified surgeon until 1828.\n\nIn 1446, the Guild of St Mary Magdelene (of Barbers) was incorporated by royal decree of Henry VI, becoming the first medical corporation in Britain or Ireland.\n\nIn 1765 Sylvester O'Halloran, a surgeon from Limerick, proposed a College of Surgeons along the lines of the College de St. Cosme in Paris, which had been regulating French surgeons since it had been created by Royal Charter by Louis IX in 1255, to train and regulate surgeons. The Dublin Society of Surgeons was founded in 1780 at the Elephant public house on Essex street (now Parliament street). Trinity College did not teach surgery as a subject until 1851, so Ireland was entirely without a school focused on surgery.\n\nTo have a separate organisation focused on providing standardised surgical education became one of the goals of the society and they lobbied for a Royal Charter, in 1781 presenting the Lord Lieutenant a petition to be incorporated separately from the barbers. The awaited charter was granted by King George III on 11 February 1784. The governing body, including the first president Samuel Croker-King and William Dease, first professor of surgery, met in the boardroom of the Rotunda Hospital for the first time on 2 March. Importantly, admission or employment was not discriminated against on sectarian grounds. Two of its chief founders, Sylvester O'Halloran and William Dease, as well as eleven out of its first 57 presidents, were Catholics. The college also recognised the medical qualifications given by the Catholic university from 1856, which gave legitimacy to their diplomas. The first candidate for examination was John Birch, in August 1784.\n\nThe current location, at the corner of York Street, was acquired in September 1805, with additional land at Glover's Alley bought in 1809. It was previously an abandoned Quaker burial ground. The Duke of Bedford laid the first stone of the new building on St. Patrick's Day, 1806 and building reached completion in March 1810.\n\nA supplemental charter was granted by Queen Victoria in 1844, dividing medical graduates into Licentiates and Fellows. Initially, physicians were trained alongside surgeons. In 1886 these two disciplines were merged, and the medical school began operation. As a result of this historical legacy, graduates of medicine still receive Licentiate diplomas from the two Royal Colleges as well as now being awarded MB (Bachelor of Medicine) BCh (Bachelor of Surgery) and BAO (Bachelor of the Art of Obstetrics) degrees by the National University of Ireland.\n\nDuring the 1916 Rising, the main college building on St Stephen's Green was occupied by Irish Citizen Army forces, led by Commandant Michael Mallin and Countess Markievicz. After surrendering, both were tried and sentenced to death. Mallin was executed while Markievicz's sentence was commuted due to her gender.\n\nRCSI was the first medical institution of learning to offer a 4-year graduate entry programme for medicine in Ireland. Now defunct subjects taught include: Logic (1852–1862), Military Surgery (1851–1860), Botany (1792–1889) and Hygiene or Political Medicine (1841–1921, then united with chair of Medical Jurisprudence).\nSince the 1980s Beaumont Hospital, Dublin has been the principal centre for medical training. Other affiliated hospitals include teaching hospitals such as Connolly Hospital, Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital, and St. Joseph's Hospital, Dublin, and there is now a group within the HSE hospital management structure, the RCSI Hospitals group.\n\nIn 2010, Prof. Eilis McGovern became President of RCSI and thereby the first female President of any surgical Royal College in the world.\n\nThe RCSI motto, \"Consilio Manuque\" (\"Scholarship and Dexterity\"), was adopted from the College de St. Cosme in Paris, which had been afforded the motto by Louis XIV. It was originally \"Consiloque Manuque\", his personal motto.\n\n\n\nRCSI is a culturally diverse, international organisation with alumni present in almost every country in the world. It describes its values as innovation, excellence, independence, academic freedom, diversity, tolerance and community. It champions a patient-centric approach to all its activities and endeavours.\n\nRCSI now offers undergraduate degrees in Medicine, Pharmacy and Physiotherapy and is the largest Irish medical school. Its primary purpose is the education and training of healthcare professionals and health sciences research. More than 3,800 students representing 60 nations are currently enrolled in its Medicine (1,800), Pharmacy (200) and Physiotherapy (100) programmes. There are 17,000 RCSI alumni working as medical doctors or in allied disciplines around the world.\n\nStudents at RCSI are encouraged to participate in extracurricular activities that promote service in the community and cultural awareness. A complete list of current student societies and clubs can be found on the RCSI website.\n\nThe Students' Union (SU) is an annually elected body, consisting of 8 officers. The SU is the college's bridge between faculty and the student body and is invited to most meetings, ensuring that student voices are heard on a variety of topics. The SU works closely with the Student Council, which consists of representatives from all classes at RCSI.\n\nThe Biological Society (BioSoc) is the official student society of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) and claims to be the oldest student medical society in the world.\n\nAs a leading international medical institution, RCSI is active in all medically related sectors of education around the globe. During the South African Apartheid, for example, RCSI provided medical education to those that were discriminated against. In 2005, RCSI Dubai was founded and currently offers a master's programme in Healthcare Management.\n\nIn 2007 RCSI (Royal College of Surgeons Ireland) in conjunction with Valentia Technologies, the Dublin Fire Brigade (DFB), and the Pre Hospital Emergency Care Council (PHECC) launched unique training initiative with the Emergency Medical Services Dubai Training Institute. The aim is to better patient care and improve response times within Dubai's emergency ambulance services.\n\nIn Malaysia, RCSI, together with University College Dublin (UCD), owns a branch campus within George Town, the capital city of the State of Penang. Established in 1996, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and University College Dublin Malaysia Campus (RUMC), formerly known as the Penang Medical College, offers twinning programmes in which students typically spend the first half of their courses in either RCSI or UCD, before completing the courses back at RUMC. Meanwhile, the Perdana University Royal College of Surgeon in Ireland (PU-RCSI) in the State of Selangor was established in 2011. The programme hosts up to 100 students per year on its 5-year undergraduate medical programme, the first cohort graduated in 2016.\n\nRCSI-Bahrain is a fully owned constituent university of RCSI and already has nearly 450 registered students. The first cohort commenced medical studies in October 2004 and graduates are entitled to a Degree of Bachelor of Medicine, NUI, Bachelor of Surgery, Bachelor of Obstetrics MB, BCh, BAO (NUI, RCSI) degree. In 2006 the Medical University of Bahrain established a new School of Nursing which took its first cohort of students in September 2006. Since 2009 students can also obtain the degrees conferred upon RCSI graduates from the National University of Ireland.\n\nFor students at the home institution of RCSI, options may be taken abroad as a result of collaborative agreements with other medical schools around the world. In 2007, these medical schools included Columbia University, University of Pennsylvania, and Tufts University. There are also informal agreements with other institutions such as the Johns Hopkins University and Mayo Clinic.\n\nMore than 60 countries from each continent are represented in the RCSI student body.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1804882", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1804882", "title": "Lisa the Simpson", "text": "Lisa the Simpson\n\n\"Lisa the Simpson\" is the seventeeth episode of \"The Simpsons\" ninth season. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 8, 1998. In the episode, Lisa fears that she may be genetically predisposed to lose her intelligence after Grandpa tells her of a family gene that can permanently take away intelligence.\n\n\"Lisa the Simpson\" was written by Ned Goldreyer and directed by Susie Dietter. This episode was the final episode with Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein as show runners. \n\nIt received generally positive reviews from critics, and is considered one of the best episodes of the ninth season.\n\nAt Springfield Elementary, Lisa is presented with a brain teaser, which she is unable to solve. Following this incident, Lisa finds herself unable to perform simple tasks. Later, Lisa tells Grampa about her recent cognitive problems. He seems to recognize this, and tells Lisa about the \"Simpson Gene\", which apparently causes all members of the Simpson family to gradually lose their intelligence as they get older.\n\nLisa appears on the TV news program \"Smartline\" to tell the citizens of Springfield to treasure their brains. As she does this, Homer decides to prove her wrong, and contacts the entire extended Simpson family to visit. However, when they arrive, Homer realizes they are also unsuccessful, unintelligent people, which only depresses Lisa further and causes Homer to send them home.\n\nHowever, before they leave, Marge urges Homer to talk to the Simpson women. Reluctantly, he talks to one of them at her request and he discovers that the women are all successful. Lisa asks why the women in her family were not affected by the \"Simpson Gene\". Dr. Simpson reveals that the defective gene is only found in the Y-chromosome and only the males are affected. As a female, Dr. Simpson tells Lisa that she will be successful like them. She is relieved that she is fine and she will not suffer the \"Simpson Gene\". When Bart realises he will be a failure in life due to his sex, he is wary and bemoaning his future. However, Homer reassures him that he will be a spectacular failure. Lisa is soon finally able to solve the brain teaser she was unable to finish earlier in the episode.\n\nMeanwhile, Jasper visits the Kwik-E-Mart and attempts to empty the freezer containing ice cream in order to freeze himself, with the intention of being defrosted sometime in the distant future. Apu decides to take advantage of this unusual situation for financial gain. The convenience store becomes more profitable as a tourist trap, until the freezer's cooling system fails, causing Jasper to defrost and walk away. Apu then decides to turn the Kwik-E-Mart into the \"Nude-E-Mart\".\n\nThis episode was the final episode that was run by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, as it was a carry-over episode from season eight. The episode was written by Ned Goldreyer, and is one of the two episodes he has written on \"The Simpsons\". Susie Dietter, one of the directors of the show, also left the show after this episode, but returned for one episode in season 18, \"Yokel Chords\".\n\nAs it was the final episode they ran, Oakley and Weinstein wanted to end on a good note, with Weinstein stating that the episode \"was meant to embody the humor, depth, and emotions of \"The Simpsons\"\". They also wished to have an episode they ran that was based on the background of every character they could do, and believed that this episode came out well. The name of the episode was the center of an argument that Oakley and Goldreyer had, as Oakley had originally wanted to have the episode named \"Lisa the Simpson\", although Goldreyer wanted to name it \"Suddenly Stupid\", a pun on a show that had been airing at the time called \"Suddenly Susan\".\n\nThe Simpsons' family members that showed up took some time to be made, but the staff enjoyed the results. All of the male Simpson family members that showed up were voiced by Dan Castellaneta, the voice of Homer. He had asked for the recording tape to be run for about 20 minutes, so he could do many different voice variations that would fit the different men, but still be close to Homer's voice.\n\nIn its original broadcast, \"Lisa the Simpson\" finished 19th in ratings for the week of March 2–8, 1998, with a Nielsen rating of 10.7, equivalent to approximately 10.4 million viewing households. It was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following \"The X-Files\".\n\nIGN's Todd Gilchrist named the episode as one of his favorites of the ninth season in his review of the DVD boxset. The authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, thought well of the episode, saying, \"A terrific episode, with a good mix of pathos (Lisa's farewell to the Springsonian and her favourite jazz club are inspired) and fun (her Homeresque 'woo-hoo') which comes together to make a refreshing and exciting look at Lisa's life.\"\n\nBill Oakley and Josh Weinstein greatly enjoyed the episode and thought of it as a great final episode that they ran. On the DVD audio commentary, writer Ned Goldreyer stated, \"I think this might have been the best episode ever produced.\"\n\n"}

Despite its name, it is not a conventional cycling sprint event - it is, in the men's event, a three-man team time trial held over three laps of a velodrome, and, in the women's event, a two-woman event held over two laps.\n\nThe current men's world record time is 41.225 seconds. This was set by the Netherlands team of Jeffrey Hoogland, Harrie Lavreysen and Roy van den Berg at the 2020 UCI Track World Championships. The women's record of 31.928 seconds was set by the Chinese pair of Guo Shuang and Gong Jinjie, at the 2012 Olympic Games.\n\nIt was first introduced into championship racing in 1995. The team sprint has been an Olympic event for men since 2000 and for women since 2012.\n\nLike the team pursuit event, two teams race against each other, starting on opposite sides of the track. At the end of the first lap, the leading rider in each team pulls up the banking leaving the second rider to lead for the next lap; at the end of the second lap, the second rider does the same, leaving the third rider to complete the last lap on his own. The team with the faster time is the winner.\n\nThe third rider needs good endurance qualities to maintain high speed to the finish. Kilometre track time trial specialists are usually chosen for this role.\n\nThe qualifying round sees each team racing by themselves against the clock. The aim of the qualifying round is to simply set the fastest possible time out of all the teams. In the Olympic Games qualifying teams will then progress into a knockout round against another team, with the two eventual surviving teams competing for the Gold and Silver and the next two competing for the Bronze medal. In the World Championships and World Cup Classics meetings, the top two from the qualifying round progress straight to the final and the third and fourth quickest fight it out for the bronze medal.\n"}

It is primarily used in water, and can be as small or as large as required by the users specifications.\n\nThe simplest acoustic network consists of one measurement resulting in a single range between sound source and sound receiver. \n\nBigger networks are only limited by the amount of equipment available, and computing power needed to resolve the resulting data. The latest acoustic networks used in the marine seismic industry can resolve a network of some 16,000 individual ranges in a matter of seconds.\n\nThe principle behind all acoustic networks is the same. Distance = speed x travel time. If the travel time and speed of the sound signal are known, we can calculate the distance between source and receiver. In most networks, the speed of the acoustic signal is assumed at a specific value. This value is either derived from measuring a signal between two known points, or by using specific equipment to calculate it from environmental conditions.\n\nThe diagram below shows the basic operation of measuring a single range.\n\n\nIf the operator is using acoustic ranges to position items in unknown locations they will need to use more than the single range example shown above. \n\nAs there is only one measurement, the receiver could be anywhere on a circle with a radius equal to the calculated range and centered on the transmitter.\n\nAudition and acoustic solutions for environmental sounds and noises acquisition and signal processing applications, designs, markets, manufactures and sells low complexity embeddable solutions for capture and other acoustic processing applications: \n- Multi-channel A/D conversion\n- Beamforming and front-end acoustic processing solutions for low noise audio capture\n- Standalone and Embeddable\n- System for acoustic ambient intelligent applications\n\nIf a second transmitter is added to the system the number of possible positions for the receiver is reduced to two.\n\nIt is only when three or more ranges are introduced into the system, is the position of the receiver achieved.\n"}

His father was Volesus Valerius, and his brothers were Marcus Valerius Volusus and Manius Valerius Volusus Maximus. He had a daughter, Valeria, and possibly a son or grandson who was also named Publius Valerius Poplicola who served as consul in 475 BC and 460 BC. Before holding public office, Valerius had spoken in defence of the plebs, the common people of Rome.\n\nIn 509 BC, Valerius was one of the leaders of the Roman revolution, together with Lucius Junius Brutus, Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus, and Spurius Lucretius Tricipitinus. Winning over public opinion while the king was campaigning away from the city, they deposed and banished Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the seventh and last King of Rome. In place of the monarchy, they established a republic, together with the office of consul. Brutus and Collatinus were elected the first consuls.\n\nFrom exile, the Tarquins plotted the assassination of the consuls, together with some disaffected members of the Aquillii and Vitellii, who had benefited from the deposed regime. Valerius was informed of the plot by a slave, Vindicius. He personally investigated the conspiracy, sneaking into the Aquillius estate and finding incriminating evidence, based on which the consuls held a public trial. The conspirators, including two of Brutus' sons, were found guilty and executed. Valerius played a leading role in the trial.\n\nAfter the trial, Brutus demanded that his colleague, Collatinus, resign the consulship and go into exile, as a member of the hated royal family, whom the people could not trust. Collatinus was stunned by this betrayal, as he had been one of the leaders of the rebellion following the death of his wife, Lucretia, at the hands of the king's son, Sextus Tarquinius. Nevertheless, he resigned, and Valerius was elected to replace him.\n\nMeanwhile, Tarquin, whose family was of Etruscan origin, obtained the support of the Etruscan cities of Tarquinii and Veii. At the head of an Etruscan army, Tarquin fought the consuls Brutus and Valerius at the Battle of Silva Arsia. Valerius commanded the Roman infantry, while Brutus led the cavalry. Arruns Tarquinius, the king's son, died in combat with Brutus, who was also mortally wounded, but the Romans were ultimately victorious. Valerius collected the spoils of battle and returned to Rome, where he celebrated a triumph on March 1, 509 BC. His four-horse chariot subsequently became the traditional vehicle for a victorious Roman general. Then, Valerius held a magnificent funeral for Brutus, and gave a memorable speech.\n\nLivy wrote that Valerius fought the Veientes again in the same year, although the reason is not stated.\n\nAfter the death of Brutus, Valerius was the sole surviving consul. Spurius Lucretius was chosen in place of Brutus, but he died after a few days, and was followed by Marcus Horatius Pulvillus. When Valerius began construction of a new house on top of the Velian Hill, which would be conspicuously visible from the Senate house, a rumour began to circulate that he intended to re-establish the monarchy, with himself as king. At once, Valerius stopped building, and demolished the structure in a single night. Addressing an assembly of the people, he caused his lictors to lower their fasces as a mark of humility, and to remove the axes from them within the city. \"I have just liberated Rome, bravely, but now I am slandered, like being either an Aquillius or a Vitellian. I am the bitterest enemy of the former kings, so I shouldn't be accused of wanting to be king.\" In order to allay suspicions, he caused his house to be built at the foot of the hill, rather than its peak. In later times, the Temple of Victory stood in the same place.\n\nFor his actions and deference to the people of Rome, Valerius received the surname \"Poplicola\", meaning \"one who courts the people\". Before the impending elections, Valerius filled up the ranks of the Senate, which had been severely reduced as a result of the revolution and the subsequent war. The consul also promulgated new laws, including the right of appeal (\"provocatio\") from the decisions of a magistrate, and demanding the forfeiture of all the rights of anyone convicted of plotting to restore the monarchy.\n\nPoplicola was elected consul three more times, in 508, 507, and 504 BC. Horatius was his colleague again in 507, while his colleague in 508 and 504 was Titus Lucretius Tricipitinus. He was the first consul ever to be re-elected.\n\nIn 508 BC, Lars Porsena, the king of Clusium, attacked Rome at the behest of Tarquin. According to Plutarch, both Poplicola and his colleague, Lucretius, were severely wounded during the battle. During the siege, Poplicola executed a successful sally, defeating a Clusian raiding party. According to Plutarch, Poplicola negotiated a treaty with Porsena, ending the war. He gave the king hostages, including his daughter Valeria, whom Porsena protected from the Tarquins.\n\nIn 506, when his brother Marcus was consul, the Sabines attacked Rome. Poplicola participated in two Roman victories, repelling the invasion. The people rewarded Poplicola with a house on the Palatine Hill.\n\nIn 505, the Latin League and the Sabines threatened Rome with a large army. Although diplomatic negotiations were halted, Poplicola meddled with the politics of the Sabines, assisting Attius Clausus, who moved to Rome with five hundred followers. Clausus became a Roman citizen under the name of Appius Claudius; he was the founder of the Claudii. When the Sabines attempted to besiege Rome, Poplicola successfully commanded the army, anticipating their movements and thwarting their plans. He was elected consul for the fourth time in 504 BC, and once again defeated the Sabines. He celebrated a triumph in May of that year.\n\nPublius Valerius Poplicola died in 503 BC, shortly after passing the consular office to his successors, Agrippa Menenius Lanatus and Publius Postumius Tubertus. Livy records that at the time of his death, he was considered \"by universal consent to be the ablest man in Rome, in the arts both of peace and war\". He had little money, and so was buried at the public charge, and was mourned by the Roman matrons as had been done for Brutus before him.\n\nBy decree, each citizen contributed a quadrans for the funeral. The remains of Poplicola were buried within the city of Rome, on the Velian Hill. His death was mourned for an entire year. After Poplicola, many noted members of the Valerian gens were buried near the same spot.\n\nIn 1977 an inscription was discovered in the ruins of the ancient town of Satricum. The Lapis Satricanus dates from the late 6th to early 5th centuries BC and bears the name \"Poplios Valesios\", which would be rendered in Classical Latin as Publius Valerius. This does not prove the historicity of the narrative given by later Roman historians, but it does demonstrate that at least one prominent individual did indeed bear the name at the close of the 6th century.\n\nIn \"The Federalist Papers\", a collection of 85 essays promoting the adoption of the United States Constitution, written by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay in 1787–1788, the three statesmen used the allonym \"Publius\" in honor of Poplicola's role in establishing the Roman Republic.\n\nFollowing the Spanish–American War, a piece titled \"The Duty of the American People as to the Philippines\" was published under the pseudonym \"Publicola\". The author recommended the development of the Philippines to improve the lives of the Filipino people, as well as to further American trading interests in the Orient.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1804896", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1804896", "title": "Prunus serotina", "text": "Prunus serotina\n\nPrunus serotina, commonly called black cherry, wild black cherry, rum cherry, or mountain black cherry, is a deciduous tree or shrub belonging to the genus \"Prunus\". The species is widespread and common in North America and South America.\n\nBlack cherry is closely related to the chokecherry (\"Prunus virginiana\"); chokecherry, however, tends to be shorter (a shrub or small tree) and has smaller, less glossy leaves.\n\n\"Prunus serotina\" has the following subspecies and varieties:\n\n\"Prunus serotina\" is a medium-sized, fast-growing forest tree growing to a height of . Leaves are long, ovate-lanceolate in shape, with finely toothed margins. Fall leaf color is yellow to red. Flowers are small, white and 5-petalled, in racemes long which contain several dozen flowers. The flowers give rise to edible reddish-black \"berries\" (drupes), in diameter.\n\nA mature black cherry tree can easily be identified in a forest by its very broken, dark grey to black bark, which has the appearance of very thick, burnt cornflakes. However, for about the first decade or so of its life, the bark is thin, smooth, and banded, resembling that of a birch. It can also quickly be identified by its long, shiny leaves resembling those of a sourwood, and by an almond-like odor released when a young twig is scratched and held close to the nose.\n\n\"Prunus serotina\" is a pioneer species. In the Midwest, it is seen growing mostly in old fields with other sunlight-loving species, such as black walnut, black locust, and hackberry. Gleason and Cronquist (1991) describe \"P. serotina\" as \"[f]ormerly a forest tree, now abundant as a weed-tree of roadsides, waste land, and forest-margins\". It is a moderately long-lived tree, with ages of up to 258 years known, though it is prone to storm damage, with branches breaking easily; any decay resulting, however, only progresses slowly. Seed production begins around 10 years of age, but does not become heavy until 30 years and continues up to 100 years or more. Germination rates are high, and the seeds are widely dispersed by birds and bears who eat the fruit and then excrete them. Some seeds however may remain in the soil bank and not germinate for as long as three years. All \"Prunus\" species have hard seeds that benefit from scarification to germinate (which in nature is produced by passing through an animal's digestive tract).\n\n\"Prunus serotina\" was widely introduced into Western and Central Europe as an ornamental tree in the mid 20th century, where it has become locally naturalized. It has acted as an invasive species there, negatively affecting forest community biodiversity and regeneration.\n\n\"Prunus serotina\" subsp. \"capuli\" was cultivated in Central and South America well before European contact.\n\nDeer browse the foliage.\n\nLike apricots and apples, the seeds of black cherries contain cyanogenic glycosides, compounds that can be converted into cyanide, such as amygdalin. These compounds release hydrogen cyanide when the seed is ground or minced, which releases enzymes that break down the compounds. These enzymes include amygdalin beta-glucosidase, prunasin beta-glucosidase and mandelonitrile lyase. In contrast, although the flesh of cherries also contains these compounds, it does not contain the enzymes needed to produce cyanide, so the flesh is safe to eat.\n\nThe foliage, particularly when wilted, also contains cyanogenic glycosides, which convert to hydrogen cyanide if eaten by animals. Farmers are recommended to remove any trees that fall in a field containing livestock, because the wilted leaves could poison the animals. Removal is not always practical, though, because they often grow in very large numbers on farms, taking advantage of the light brought about by mowing and grazing. Entire fencerows can be lined with this poisonous tree, making it difficult to monitor all the branches falling into the grazing area. Black cherry is a leading cause of livestock illness, and grazing animals' access to it should be limited.\n\n\"P. serotina\" is a host of caterpillars of various Lepidoptera (see List of Lepidoptera which feed on \"Prunus\"). The eastern tent caterpillar defoliates entire groves some springs.\n\nKnown as capolcuahuitl in Nahuatl (the source of the \"capuli\" epithet), it was an important food in pre-Columbian Mexico. Native Americans ate the berries.\n\nThe wood of \"Prunus serotina\" is also used as a spice in foods, as it imparts a unique flavor. \n\n\"Prunus serotina\" timber is valuable; perhaps the premier cabinetry timber of the U.S., traded as \"cherry\". High quality cherry timber is known for its strong orange hues and high price. Low-quality wood, as well as the sap wood, can be more tan. Its density when dried is around .\n\n\"Prunus serotina\" trees are sometimes planted as ornamentals.\n"}

{"id": "1804907", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1804907", "title": "Woodchipper", "text": "Woodchipper\n\nA tree chipper or woodchipper is a machine used for reducing wood (generally tree limbs or trunks) into smaller woodchips. They are often portable, being mounted on wheels on frames suitable for towing behind a truck or van. Power is generally provided by an internal combustion engine from to . There are also high power chipper models mounted on trucks and powered by a separate engine. These models usually also have a hydraulic crane.\n\nTree chippers are typically made of a hopper with a collar, the chipper mechanism itself, and an optional collection bin for the chips. A tree limb is inserted into the hopper (the collar serving as a partial safety mechanism to keep human body parts away from the chipping blades) and started into the chipping mechanism. The chips exit through a chute and can be directed into a truck-mounted container or onto the ground. Typical output is chips on the order of to across in size. The resulting wood chips have various uses such as being spread as a ground cover or being fed into a digester during papermaking.\n\nMost woodchippers rely on energy stored in a heavy flywheel to do their work (although some use drums). The chipping blades are mounted on the face of the flywheel, and the flywheel is accelerated by an electric motor or internal combustion engine.\n\nLarge woodchippers are frequently equipped with grooved rollers in the throat of their feed funnels. Once a branch has been gripped by the rollers, the rollers transport the branch to the chipping blades at a steady rate. These rollers are a safety feature and are generally reversible for situations where a branch gets caught on clothing.\n\nThe woodchipper was invented by Peter Jensen (Maasbüll, Germany) in 1884, the \"Marke Angeln\" woodchipper soon became the core business of his company, which already produced and repaired communal- and woodworking-machinery.\n\nShredders that make use of high-torque low-speed grinding rollers are growing in popularity for residential use. These shredders are driven with an electric motor and are very quiet, dust free, and self-feeding. Some of these machines are equipped with an anti-jamming feature.\n\nThe original chipper design employs a steel disk with knives mounted upon it as the chipping mechanism. This technology dates back to an invention by German Heinrich Wigger, for which he obtained a patent in 1922. In this design, (usually) reversible hydraulically powered wheels draw the material from the hopper towards the disk, which is mounted perpendicularly to the incoming material. As the disk spins, the knives cut the material into chips. These are thrown out the chute by flanges on the drum. This design is not as energy-efficient as the drum-style design, but produces chips of more uniform shape and size. Most chippers currently used by commercial tree care companies are disk-type.\n\nConsumer-grade disk-style chippers usually have a material diameter capacity of . Industrial-grade chippers are available with discs as large as in diameter, requiring . One application of industrial disk chippers is to produce the wood chips used in the manufacture of particle board.\n\nNewer chippers employ mechanisms consisting of a large steel drum powered by a motor, usually by means of a belt. The drum is mounted parallel to the hopper and spins towards the output chute. The drum also serves as the feed mechanism, drawing the material through as it chips it. It is colloquially known as a \"chuck-and-duck\" chipper, due to the immediate speed attained by material dropped into the drum.\n\nChippers of this type have many drawbacks and safety issues. If an operator becomes snagged on material being fed into the machine, injury or death is very likely. Chippers of this type are also very loud. The chips produced may be very large, and if thin material is inserted, it may be cut into slivers rather than chips, and since the drum is directly driven by the engine, materials that are too large or long may stall the engine while usually remaining firmly stuck in the drum.\n\nMuch larger machines for wood processing exist. \"Whole tree chippers\" and \"Recyclers\", which can typically handle material diameters of to may employ drums, disks, or a combination of both. The largest machines used in wood processing, often called \"Tub Grinders\", may handle a material diameter of or greater, and use carbide tipped flail hammers to pulverize wood rather than cut it. These machines usually have to . Some are so heavy that they require a semi-trailer truck to be transported. Smaller models can be towed by a medium duty truck.\n\nAlthough chippers vary greatly in size, type, and capacity, the blades processing the wood are similar in construction. They are rectangular in shape and are usually to across by to long. They vary in thickness from about to . Chipper blades are made from high grade steel and usually contain a minimum of 8% chromium for hardness.\n\nThirty-one people were killed in woodchipper accidents between 1992 and 2002 in the US, according to a 2005 report by the \"Journal of the American Medical Association\".\n\nJoel and Ethan Coen's film \"Fargo\" features an infamous scene in which Peter Stormare, as Gaear Grimsrud, feeds the remains of Steve Buscemi's character, Carl Showalter, into a woodchipper. The scene, according to the film's special edition DVD, was based on the 1986 murder of Helle Crafts. The woodchipper used in the scene is now a tourist attraction at the Fargo-Moorhead Visitors Centre.\n\n"}

Victorinus was African by birth and experienced the height of his career during the reign of Constantius II. He is also known for translating two of Aristotle's books from ancient Greek into Latin: the \"Categories\" and \"On Interpretation\" (\"De Interpretatione\"). Victorinus had a religious conversion, from being a pagan to a Christian, \"at an advanced old age\" (c. 355).\n\nVictorinus, at some unknown point, left Africa for Rome (hence some modern scholars have dubbed him \"Afer\"), probably for a teaching position, and had great success in his career, eventually being promoted to the lowest level of the senatorial order. That promotion probably came at the time when he received an honorific statue in the Forum of Trajan in 354 (Jerome supplied biographical information but was not his student). Victorinus' religious conversion from Platonism to Christianity (c. 355), \"at an advanced old age\" according to Jerome, made a great impression on Augustine of Hippo, as recounted in Book 8 of the latter's \"Confessions\". His conversion is historically important in foreshadowing the conversion of more and more of the traditionally pagan intellectual class, from the gods who in pagan belief had made Rome great.\n\nBrought up a Christian, Emperor Julian had converted to a philosophical and mystical form of paganism; and once in power upon the providential death of Constantius II, then Julian attempted to reorganize the highly decentralized pagan cults, on lines analogous to the Christian Church. The emperor, wanting to purge the schools of Christian teachers, published an edict in June 362 mandating that all state appointed professors receive approval from municipal councils (the emperor's accompanying brief indicated his express disapproval of Christians lecturing on the poems of Homer or Virgil with their religion being incongruous with the religion of Homer and Virgil). Victorinus resigned his position as official \"rhetor of the city of Rome\", professor of rhetoric, not an orator. The sprightly old professor kept writing treatises on the Trinity to defend the adequacy of the Nicene Creed's definition of Christ the Son being \"of the same substance\" (\"homoousios\" in Greek) with the Father. After finishing this series of works (begun probably in late 357), he turned his hand to writing commentaries on the Pauline Epistles, the first in Latin. Although it seems from internal references that he wrote commentaries on Romans and the Corinthians letters as well, all that remains are works, with some lacunae, on Galatians, Ephesians, and Philippians (the comments from the first 16 verses of this latter are missing).\n\nWe are fairly well informed on his previous works, mostly texts for his teaching areas of grammar and rhetoric. His most important works from the standpoint of the history of philosophy were translations of Platonist authors (Plotinus and Porphyry at least), which are unfortunately lost. They greatly moved Augustine and set him on a road of creating a careful synthesis of Christianity and Neoplatonism that was tremendously influential. Victorinus wrote a brief treatise \"De Definitionibus\" (\"On Definition\") that lists and discusses various types of definitions used by rhetoricians and philosophers; he recommends the \"substantial definitions\" preferred by the latter (prior to the late 19th century this work was ascribed to Boethius). Victorinus' manual of prosody, in four books, taken almost literally from the work of Aelius Aphthonius, still exists. It is doubtful that he is the author of certain other treatises attributed to him on metrical and grammatical subjects. His commentary on Cicero's \"De Inventione\" is very diffuse.\n\nHe retained his Neoplatonic philosophy after becoming Christian, and in \"Liber de generatione divini Verbi\", he states that God is above being, and thus it can even be said that He is not. Victorinus noted, \"Since God is the cause of being, it can be said in a certain sense, that God truly is (vere ων), but this expression merely means that being is in God as an effect is in an eminent cause, which contains it though being superior to it.\"\n\nMary T. Clark has identified the following works of Marius Victorinus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1804938", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1804938", "title": "Ford EXP", "text": "Ford EXP\n\nThe Ford EXP is a sports compact coupe that was produced and sold by Ford Motor Company in North America from the 1982 to 1988 model years. The first two-seat Ford since the 1957 Thunderbird, the EXP made its debut at the 1981 Chicago Auto Show. Sharing the dashboard, wheelbase, suspension, and powertrain with the Ford Escort, the EXP was longer, lower, and more aerodynamic than its five-seat counterpart.\n\nIn line with the first-generation Escort, the EXP was produced in a version from 1982 to 1985, undergoing a facelift during the 1985 model year. The model was dropped after the 1988 model year. Although not intended to replace the EXP (as it was originally designed to become the 1989 Ford Mustang), the 1989 Ford Probe would become the next front-wheel drive sports coupe sold by Ford. After the EXP, the next two-seat Ford marketed in North America would be the 2002 Ford Thunderbird. Then in 1998, the Escort of the time was marketed as a ZX2, a nod to the EXP and the XR2 from the 1980s. Although EXPs were sports cars, it was common to remove the rear carpeting to put in rear seats as the floor pans are identical between the 3-door Escorts, Escort GTs, and EXPs, however the lower roof line makes rear seating uncomfortable.\n\nFrom 1982 to 1983, the EXP was sold by Lincoln-Mercury dealers as the Mercury LN7. The LN7 was distinguished largely by its \"bubbleback\" hatch, large bumper strips across the doors, \"black-out\" tail lights, and more slits in the nose clip than those of an EXP. The vehicle, however, was dropped after failing to meet sales expectations.\n\nBy 1980, Ford Motor Company had entered a period of major transition. Following the termination of Lee Iaccoca (to become CEO of Chrysler), chairman Henry Ford II retired and Ford's chief stylist, Eugene Bordinat, stepped down as well.\n\nDuring the late 1970s, there had been a push by automobile manufacturers around the world to make small, fuel efficient cars; this was initiated by the OPEC oil embargo of October 17, 1973–1974. This embargo included a 70% increase in oil prices, causing long lines at gasoline filling stations, and skyrocketing prices for gasoline. People wanted, demanded more miles for their gasoline dollars. By the end of the decade, this led auto manufacturers from the United States, Japan, and West Germany to rethink the adage that \"bigger is better\".\n\nThe world would respond with smaller cars. A second energy crisis and a renewed recession followed in 1979-1982. Ford studied a two-seater commuter car called the Super Gnat. It was to have a three-cylinder engine with a wheelbase of just 78 inches. In addition, Ford built the Mustang RSX concept car, exploring a slightly smaller two-seat derivative of the Mustang.\n\nAlthough Lee Iacocca was fired from the company, the most important part of his career at Ford was the Ford Mustang. In 1964, the Mustang was developed by adapting the underpinnings and powertrain of the mainstream Ford Falcon economy car and repackaging it as the sporty Mustang. During the 1970s, the same product engineering was used in the development of the Ford Granada, Ford Thunderbird/Mercury Cougar, and the entire Lincoln product line.\n\nTo replace the aging Ford Pinto, the company began development on the Ford Escort in the late 1970s. While originally intended to be a \"world car\", the North American version shared little aside from its engine, suspension, and its name in the final design.\n\nThe basis for developing the Escort into the EXP stemmed from company marketing research. Ford felt that the growing number of one- and two-person households, combined with the lifestyle of the younger target audience who desired a small sporty car, led them to the conclusion that Americans wanted a \"lively little car that is dependable, efficient, and good-looking\". Conversely, if a potential customer wanted the extra room for four or five passengers, they would buy an Escort, Mustang, or Fairmont. Much like a European gran turismo, the EXP would be a personal vehicle for two people with a cargo area in back for emergency transport of anything or anyone else.\n\nAs the Falcon became the Mustang and the Maverick became the Granada, Ford restyled the Escort from the beltline up and turned the rear seats into cargo space. The distinguishing feature between the vehicles would be an all-new rear hatchback and front headlights. Mercury received a similar variant of the Lynx named the LN7.\n\nComparing the EXP to the original Thunderbird, Ford Division, general manager Louis E. Latalf said, \"we're introducing another two-seater with the same flair, but the EXP will be a very affordable, very fuel efficient car matched to the lifestyles of the eighties.\"\n\nFord EXP and Mercury LN7 development took place in Ford's St Thomas plant in Ontario, the plant that produced the majority of EXPs and LN7s and all of the EXPs and LN7s for the 1982 and 1983 models. Here LN7s and EXPs were continually experimented on and further engineered as more technologies became available. But the plant only produced EXPs from February 16, 1981 to August 5, 1983 and LN7s from February 16, 1981 to June 30, 1983 ending the 1983 model year for both cars leaving the American plants to produce all the 1984 to 1988 EXPs.\n\nAccording to an article published in \"Popular Mechanics\" (March 1981), the letters EXP were supposed to stand for \"Erika Project Personal\", where project cars are designated \"X\". The \"Erika\" came from the code-name from the European Escort.\n\nBut it is more likely the abbreviations \"EXP\" and \"LN7\" are just different variations on the models they're derivative of: \"Escort\" and \"Lynx\".\n\nThe EXP was coming but Ford hadn't marketed it yet or decided what some of its details and options would be. A few EXPs were built just for conceptual design and advertisement. These extremely rare EXPs shared the body style of the EXPs and LN7s to come in 1982 but featured many things that would be available in every EXP or LN7. They were all painted in vibrant colors with black painted across the entire car under the door bumper-lines and had a round silver badge where Ford's blue oval would find itself in 1982. These models particularly stood out as they had dual vents towards the front of the hood instead of the vents to be later seen on the front bumper clips, lacked bumper strips on the doors, and the rear taillights were completely red where all the EXPs produced had black around the reverse lights. An SS package and \"bubblebacks\" -like that of the LN7 and 2nd gen. EXPs- were optional along with black paint around the door windows later seen on 2nd gen. EXPs, aluminum oval-spoke wheels and \"1.6L\" badges on the front fenders. At least 10 were made in Canada and were all featured in a rare catalog featuring only those cars and people with them. No sightings have been recorded since.\n\nThe first non-concept or prototype EXP (white with red interior) and LN7 (green with grey interior) both rolled off the line on February 16, 1981. The first EXP was driven off the line by Ontario Premier Bill Davis.\n\nFord expected to make/sell 200,000 EXPs and 70,000 LN7s in the first model year (1982) but their production numbers only met half that expectation. It is presumed they didn't meet the predicted sales figures either.\nThe EXP's uni-body rode on the Escort's 94.2inch (2393 mm) wheelbase, with front-wheel drive, and four-wheel independent suspension from 1970s European Fords. At 50 inches tall and 14 feet long, the EXP was longer, lower, and sportier than the North American Escort. The EXP's wheelbase is also close to the \"foxbody\" Mustang of the same era differing by less than an inch in length.\n\nPerformance wasn't the car's strong suit, however, since the EXP weighed about 200 pounds more than a typical 1980s Escort but carried the same small 1.6 L \"CVH\" I4 engine rated at 70 hp (52 kW) and a standard 4-speed MTX-I manual transaxle. The engine was specifically developed for the North American market of fuel efficiency while the European models of these engines spun faster and made more power. Originally there were to be two available engine options; 1.3-liter CVH and a 1.6-liter CVH, however the choice was made to only use the larger version. Europe ended up with all the CVH variants while North America only saw the 1.6 and later 1.9-liter CVH engines. Also the suspension is that of European Fords from the 1970s, sharing nearly every part with modifications for FWD applications of North American Escorts. Nevertheless, the March 1981 issue of \"Car and Driver\" reported that their EXP with a manual transmission reached 44 MPG on the highway, a figure comparable to modern hybrid cars.\n\nBoth the Ford EXP and the Mercury LN7 had a sharply sloped windshield, wheel arches with prominent lips, and wide body side moldings not far below the top of the wheel well. The biggest difference was the rear fascia. The EXP was a notchback with a lift-up hatch, while the LN7 used a big \"bubbleback\" backlite. The EXP's minimalist grille consisted merely of twin horizontal slats on the sloped front panel (the LN7 had ten). The \"bubbleback\" appearance was used on the larger Mustang-derived sports coupe for Mercury called the Capri. These appearances made the coefficient of drag low for both the EXP (0.37) and LN7 (0.36) and also helped fuel efficiency.\n\nPriced considerably higher than the Escort, the EXP carried an ample list of standard equipment. It included power brakes, full instrumentation, full carpeting, map lighting (non-sunroof), electric back window defroster, power hatchback release, a digital clock, a cargo area security shade, and rims that are noticeably wider than those of Escorts. Models with a manual transmission had a sport-tuned exhaust. Automatic models had a wide-open throttle cutout switch for the optional air conditioning compressor clutch. Other options include floor vents and power steering or air conditioning and manual steering, AM/FM radio, cruise control, roof luggage rack, rear window wiper, various seat styles and fabrics, removable sunroof, right hand mirror, TRX tires and suspension, child seat, and a very wide variety of colors inside and out with many various pinstripes and other painted decals.\n\nAs the full 1982 model year began, Ford offered an optional (at no extra cost) 4.05:1 final drive for better performance. Later came a close-ratio transmission with 3.59:1 final drive ratio intended for the same purpose. Ford also offered an 8\"(203 mm) rear brake drum set over the 7\"(180 mm) rear brake drums of other EXPs and Escorts. As the years went on many different rim options became available but the color choices became more limited.\n\nFinally, in March 1982, an 80 hp (59 kW) version of the CVH engine became available (High Output option H.O.). It had higher (9.0:1) compression, a dual-inlet air cleaner, lower-restriction exhaust, a bifurcated four-into-two-into-one exhaust manifold, larger carburetor venturis (a 32mm primary and a 34mm secondary compared to the 32mm of both venturis in the non-HO engine), and a higher-lift (0.289 mm) camshaft.\n\nThen, in the last week of September 1982, in co-operation with Bosch, Ford Canada assembled the first electronic multi-port fuel-injected (EFI) 1.6 L for the EXP GT giving it the distinction of being the first model Ford offered with that option for the U.S. market. Although EFI with the EEC IV was an add on to the existing 80 hp H.O. \"CVH\" engine, it produced 88 hp (65.5 kW) and 94 lb/ft of torque in a 9.5:1 compression ratio, naturally aspirated configuration giving it an affinity for higher octane fuel.\n\nThe Mercury division of Ford Motor Company marketed the EXP as the Mercury LN7, much as the Mercury Lynx was derived from the Ford Escort. While sharing a common powertrain with the EXP, the LN7 differed slightly in its styling. As with the Mercury Capri, the LN7 was styled with a convex-curved \"bubbleback\" backlite. In addition, the taillights were tinted black and the grille had slightly different styling having 10 grille slats compared to the 2 of the EXP.\n\nThe LN7 sold far under sales projections and was discontinued after the 1983 model year after approximately 40,000 were sold; compared to the rest of the Lincoln-Mercury model line, a two-seat compact sports coupe was relatively out of place.\n\nThe biggest option for 1982 with both EXPs & LN7s was the TR package, this would be available in 1982-1985 models. \n\nThe TR package featured special Michelin TRX tires of a special metric size of 365mm which is between 14in & 15in diameter wheels. These tires performed \"well\", made only by Michelin with an extremely soft rubber compound with a tread pattern like that of drive tires on garden tractors. All these factors made for sticky cornering but they turn to dust under hard braking and wear fast. Only one vendor sells the correct diameter as of today and the supply is very limited, they haven't been made since the 1990s so the ones for sale are all NOS that are now over 25 years old making them unsafe for road use even if stored correctly. As such the vendor says explicitly \"NOT for road use\" and \"No warranty or guarantee\" making them good for car shows but any speeds over 25mph almost ensure they'll explode, even perfectly stored TRX tires are typically found with severe rotting/checking. Due to the nature of the TRX wheels they can't be resized to 14in standards either making the TRX wheels near useless.\n\nThe other TR equipment pieces were:\nStiffer valving for the struts (Turbo models had red Konis)\nHigher rate front springs (160 lb/in vs standard 120 lb/in)\nLarger front swaybar (26mm vs standard 24mm, Turbo models are 27mm)\nStiffer suspension bushings\nHigher rate progressive rear springs (320-548 lb/in vs standard 195 lb/in continuous rate)\n\n By 1984, Ford was trying hard to conquer the youth market, especially the affluent young motorist with offerings such as the Mustang SVO, Thunderbird Turbo Coupe, and the new EXP Turbo Coupe also built by Ford's Special Vehicle Operations (SVO). It shared most of the parts the McLaren ASC EXP came with; turbo, Koni shocks, stiffer springs, lower ride height, improved brakes, and TRX Michelin tires.\n\nIn the car's initial development there was a plan for adding fuel injection and a turbo charger to increase power significantly, but there wasn't enough time to get it into the first 2 production years. The turbocharged 1.6 L \"CVH\" engine, available for the Escort and EXP, featured a high-lift camshaft and EEC-IV electronic controls. With an 8:1 compression ratio and boost pressure up to 8 psi, torque was increased to 120 lb/ft and power raised to 120 hp (89.5 kW), a gain of some 35 percent over the naturally aspirated models.\n\nAll these improvements allowed for a 0-60mph time of 9 seconds and 1/4mi time of 16.9s at 82mph which unimpressive today was good for the era. The 1983 EFI or HO 5-speed EXPs would only conquer 0-60mph in 14s and 1/4mi in 20s at 70mph (all depending on the options and model year).\nBut not even the 86-88 EXPs with the 1.9L EFI HO motor could touch the Turbo model with a 1/4mi time of 17.5s at 77mph.\n\nThe Turbo Coupe had a unique front air dam and rear decklid spoiler, with a taped \"Turbo\" badge on the rear bumper. It also had two-tone paint with a black lower section, a unique C-pillar appliqué featuring the EXP lettering, black wheel flares, and black rocker panel moldings.\n\nIts only optional features were AC (Air Conditioning) and removable sunroof.\nIts transition from 1984 into 1985 included the change from the 3-spoke (round-spoke) steering wheel to the 2-spoke (square-spoke) steering wheel, the softer 2-piece shift knob and vinyl boot to the 1-piece shift knob and square rubber boot, and the addition of the (at the time) newly federal-mandated 3rd brake light built into the spoiler (which would be seen on all EXPs from 1986 forward).\n\nBy the mid-1980s, two-seat compact sports coupes were in vogue. By 1985, the EXP found competition in the Honda CR-X, Pontiac Fiero, and Toyota MR2. While the latter two were mid-engine, rear-wheel drive vehicles, all were similar to the EXP in deriving a number of powertrain and chassis components from other production vehicles. After four years of production, the first-generation EXP was discontinued during the 1985 model year. Originally marketed towards buyers that valued fuel efficiency over high performance, the Ford EXP had begun to struggle against newer vehicles. Build quality and refinement were also inferior to its Japanese competitors.\n\nIn 1985, a group of Ford assembly employees took an EXP off the line and upgraded it with parts from the updated 1985½ Ford Escort. The one-off \"prototype\" built by the factory workers was presented to Ford CEO Donald Petersen, who liked it and approved it for production, as a \"1985½\" model.\n\nOfficially renamed the \"Ford Escort EXP\", the second-generation EXP abandoned the controversial front headlights and widely flared fenders in favor of a version of the bodywork from the standard Ford Escort, sharing its flush-mounted headlamps and amber turn signal lenses. The Escort EXP was given a model-specific front bumper with an integrated air dam; along with the Escort GT, the EXP was produced with its own grille, distinguished by a single slot below the Ford emblem. The rear bodywork remained largely the same; with the exception of the Mercury LN7 \"bubble hatch\" becoming standard; the grey rear taillamp lenses introduced in 1985 were retained. To match the lowered front bumpers, the rear bumpers were redesigned.\n\nAlong with the exterior, the interior of the EXP was redesigned to match the rest of the Ford Escort line.\n\nThe Ford Escort EXP Luxury Coupe was equipped with low-back cloth/vinyl (or all-vinyl) seats (from the standard Ford Escort), AM/FM stereo radio, overhead console, left remote mirror (standard), with a tachometer and trip odometer. From the 1985½ introduction to the end of 1986, the Luxury Coupe came with a 1.9L CVH inline-4 with a 2-barrel carburetor, making 90 hp. For 1987 and 1988, the 1.9L engine was equipped with throttle-body fuel injection, termed CFI (Central Fuel Injection) by Ford, while still making 90 hp.\n\nIntroduced for 1986, the Ford Escort EXP Sport Coupe was produced through 1988. Externally distinguished by 15-inch alloy wheels, dual electric mirrors, and fog lamps, the Sport Coupe was fitted with components from the Ford Escort GT, including suspension and brake upgrades and sport bucket seats. Fitted with a center console, the Sport Coupe was equipped with a systems monitor (with LEDs as warning indicators for headlights, taillights, and fuel level). The Sport Coupe was fitted with a 106 hp version of the 1.9L CVH engine, equipped with multiport fuel injection. For 1987, the output was increased to 115 hp.\n\nFrom its 1982 introduction, sales of the EXP were never as strong as Ford marketing executives had intended. After the introduction of competitive 2-seat vehicles (such as the Pontiac Fiero and Honda CRX), buyers shifted towards higher-performance vehicles. During the 1980s, insurance rates on 2-seat cars were rising over those of cars with back seats, creating a separate deterrent for buyers.\n\nWithin Ford, the development of the Ford Mustang played a separate part in the demise of the EXP. In 1982, Ford commenced work on the fourth-generation Mustang; beginning work on a \"design of tomorrow\", the goal was to shift the Mustang from rear-wheel drive to front-wheel drive, increasing fuel efficiency; in place of the Fox platform, the Mustang was to become a counterpart of the Mazda MX-6. At the time, General Motors was considering a similar redesign of the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird by 1990.\n\nBy the mid-1980s, as the public learned of the planned front-wheel drive Mustang, it spawned a negative reaction from buyers and dealers, leading Ford to reconsider the decision. However, as the front-wheel drive car was significantly far along in the development cycle, Ford chose to bring it to production, renaming it Ford Probe (after a series of aerodynamically advanced Ford concept cars). As Ford could not afford the market overlap of producing three compact sports coupes (alongside the Ford Festiva, Ford Escort, and Ford Tempo two-doors), the company chose to discontinue the Escort EXP, as it was the slowest-selling nameplate.\n\nIn October 1988, after over 225,000 Ford (Escort) EXPs were produced, the final Ford Escort EXP rolled off the assembly line.\n\nFord was experimenting with the EXP's potential with the newly released EXPs and LN7s of 1982. A select few of each were turned into convertible models. These models are very rare as Ford did not sell any more than the estimated 28 LN7s and recorded 8 EXPs that were produced, not to mention what kind of costs were involved in converting these cars. The 8 EXPs were converted by Dynamic Conversions in Hillsdale, Michigan. The 28 LN7s were converted by Andy Hotten's crew in Ford's St Thomas factory where most EXPs and LN7s were built. Very few of these convertible models are reported to be around today.\n\nFurther experimentation from Ford with their EXPs resulted in producing four all-electric EXPs. These selected 1982 EXPs are powered by 39HP GE (General Electric) electric motors and Soleq parts all built together by Electric Vehicle Associates (EVA) out of Cleveland, OH. EVA used their technology from the Escorts they made (\"EVcorts\"). Production of both vehicles were limited as the costs to convert these two cars was far beyond the cars' original values. Its original range is estimated between 20 and 60 miles with a top speed of . This idea didn't meet expectations either as these EXPs were lacking both sport and practicality. It's unsure if EVA went on to convert EXPs and Escorts at their own expense.\n\nMany other EXPs would be subject to electric propulsion, but not on Ford's dime. It was a popular competition in colleges, tech schools, and universities to convert smaller cars like EXPs to electric power and then compete against other schools with them. Involved in these competitions were the cars' general performance, endurance, and efficiency.\n\nIn 1982 American Sunroof Company (ASC) and McLaren supposedly equipped two EXPs with sunroofs, true notchbacks, ground effects, and charged aspiration. ASC (American Sunroof Corporation) did the cosmetic modifications and McLaren made the performance modifications. One has the following modifications: a supercharger, turbocharger, tighter steering, 1 inch shorter ride height, Recaro racing seats, TRX suspension, KONI shocks, twin fuel pumps, fuel injection, machined uprights (for wheel clearance), enhanced power steering, and portion-valved brakes. This EXP ASC McLaren makes 120HP and 137 ft/lb of torque. Ford already had their own removable sunroofs optional for all EXPs & LN7s but later (1984-1985) added their own ground effects, \"bubblebacks\", and spoilers to save money and turbocharged EXPs themselves to make the same amount of power. The other EXP has yet to be spotted.\n\nAs part of a Weinstock's promotion a select batch of Mercury LN7s were built with all black interior, purple exterior, and gold pinstripes along the body and within the black bump strips. These LN7s had every available factory option and could only be won by sweepstakes entries (not open to Weinstock's or Ford employees). Along with being awarded an LN7, winners were granted a $1000 gift certificate from Weinstock's. If a winner had already ordered an LN7 they could be refunded in full and their ordered LN7 became the Scoundrel Edition car if they so chose. It's assumed that only 500 of these LN7s were ever made.\n\nAnother promotional sweepstakes event involved some rare LN7 replicas of the Budweiser Race Team's LN7 funny-car in 1982. Grand prize of the drawing was a normal LN7 (provided by Ford Motor Company) painted to perfectly match the real drag strip car, only one model is known to exist and its whereabouts are unknown. First prizes were tickets to two NHRA national events. Second prizes were four go-cart replicas of the Budweiser funny car, eight others were won at select NHRA events. It is unknown how many were made but they were all built by Ford Motor Company with 3hp motors powering them up to 15mph.\n\nAt least one first-generation EXP was modified as an early \"test mule\" for the 3.0 L SHO V6 engine co-developed between Ford and Yamaha and was part of Ford's GN34 program to develop a mid-engine sports car. Some were made RWD with the Yamaha V6 on display in the rear bubble hatch while others were AWD models with the V6 under the hatch as well. Some V6s were punched from 3.0 to 3.2 to 3.4 to 3.6 liters all mated to a ZF-5 transmissions.\n\nIt is unknown how many EXP-based test mules were built; later prototypes were custom-built designs. The GN34 mid-engine sports car was shelved in the late 1980s, with the Ford-Yamaha V6 engine leading to the introduction of the Ford Taurus SHO sports sedan.\n\nOne rare Mercury LN7 was also converted specifically for the 1981 PPG CART Indy Car World Series. It featured a dramatic front chin spoiler, brake-cooling ducts just ahead of the rear wheels, 14\" Apache-5 aluminum wheels, clear headlight and foglight covers (for aero-speed purposes) and a wrap-around rear spoiler all provided by ASC (American Sunroof Company) and Ford. \n\nThe power plant was an early turbocharged version of the 1.6L CVH built by Jack Roush and Ford's SVO, featuring a reworked version of the Motorcraft 2150 2-barrel carburetor, TRW cold-forged pistons for 8.5:1 compression, magna-fluxed & polished factory connecting rods, ported head with 3-angle valve seats milled down .06\", stock camshaft & lifters, European 1.6L CVH head gasket, a turbocharger adding just 8psi (but capable of providing 15psi with race fuel), custom 6qt baffled oil pan, and water-alcohol-injection all adding up to 7,000RPMs (electronically limited) of 180 horsepower (no dyno results were recorded above 8psi of boost). \n\nThe transmission is a factory Escort/Lynx/EXP/LN7 4-speed manual transmission blue-printed with extreme care and tight tolerances at an aircraft level allowing it to handle both the 180 horsepower, 7,000RPMs of input, and top speeds around 125mph.\n\nSuspension also had to be heavily modified to handle 125mph and quick handling of turns. Doing so required a thicker sway-bar, lower ride height, increased spring rate by 15%, Koni shocks all around, and redesigned, fully adjustable rear suspension.\n\nInterior is near factory specifications with the addition multiple warning lights and boost gauge, full roll cage, fuel cell, fire-countermeasures, and ASC/McLaren sport seats with 4-point harnesses.\n\nOutside of the \"1982 CART Indy World Series News Media Guide\" very few photos of the car exist but it is currently on display in the Roush Racing Museum with the 1982 EXP PPG Pace Car among a few of Ford's GN34 specimens. \n\nOne rare Ford EXP is one converted specifically serve as a CART Series PPG Indy Car World Series Pace Car in 1982. This car wears a tapered front clip and unique hatch and body-integrated spoiler, both reminiscent of a past EXP prototype. It also is widened at each of the four quarter panels of the car believed to allow room for a Ford-Yamaha SHO V6 in the front or possibly in the rear like the aforementioned GN34 EXP experiment. It is also possible to be host to another 1.6L CVH built and turbocharged by Jack Roush and Ford's SVO. \n\nVery few photos of the car exist but it is currently on display in the Roush Racing Museum with the 1981 LN7 PPG Pace Car among a few of Ford's GN34 specimens.\n\nFord provided 3 EXP/LN7 cars for SCCA competition racing in 1981–1983.\n\nOne car was made with PBS. What was previously an LN7 was transformed into a competition race car through fiberglass body parts, racing suspension, and a PBS 2.0L (Ford 1.6L) CVH mated with a 5-speed transmission. \nA second car was made into a competition rally car by Blume Power Inc. for driver \"Dick Turner\" rumored to be RWD and hosting a V8 under the hood.\nThe third car was another circuit car like the PBS LN7 but little is known about this racer.\n\n"}

It falls under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Honolulu and its bishop; it is staffed by the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary. Located at 130 Ohua Avenue, adjacent to Kalākaua Avenue in Waikiki, Saint Augustine by the Sea ministers primarily to visitors, as Waikiki contains the highest number of domestic and international visitors in the State of Hawai‘i.\n\nThe parish campus is the home of the Damien Museum which houses several relics of Saint Damien of Moloka‘i and related historical artifacts. A 20-minute video is shown about Father Damien and his work with Kalaupapa leprosy settlement.\n\nThe current clerics of the parish include Father Lane K. Akiona, SS.CC., pastor, and Father Lucius, SS.CC., parochial vicar.\n\nFather Modestus Favens, SS.CC., was said to have built the first chapel in Waikiki as early as 1854. The chapel was about twenty-feet by forty-feet with a steeple. Mass was seldom said in this chapel - the predominant weekly activity was Sunday afternoon devotions and religious instruction. In 1898, during the Spanish–American War, many American soldiers were encamped near Diamond Head. At their request, Msgr. Gulstan Ropert, SS.CC., authorized the first Mass for these soldiers in the chapel. The chapel was deemed much too small for continued military use and a temporary wooden frame structure was erected by the military authorities with a roof and open sides thatched with coconut palm fronds. Msgr. Ropert blessed the new structure and entrusted it to the care of Father Valentin Franckx, SS.CC. Father Franckx later made improvements to the chapel by putting in flooring, galvanized roofing and lattice walls. When the soldiers left, the community in Waikiki continued to frequent the chapel on Sundays when Father Valentin said Mass.\n\nRopert approved plans to build a more permanent church and in 1901, on the feast day of Saint Augustine, he dedicated the new church under the title of its festal namesake, as the carpenters took a break while the services were conducted. Waikiki was being touted as a tourist destination and the number of parishioners and visitors continued to grow. The church underwent enlargement in 1910, and 1925, essentially by cutting the building in two and moving the back to the beach. In 1920, the church acquired a right-of-way access to Kalākaua Avenue.\n\n"}

Carlsen played left-handed with a one-handed backhand. His greatest asset was his powerful serve, and his game was therefore best suited to fast surfaces (grass and hardcourt). For most of his long career, Carlsen was Denmark's best tennis player, and consistently among the few Danish players playing at the highest international level. He was awarded as best Danish \"Tennis Player of the Year\" seven times by the Danish Tennis Federation (first time in 1991, last time in 2005). Two times the award went to the Danish Davis Cup team, of which Kenneth Carlsen until 2003 was a central part (having a 29–13 record in singles).\n\nCarlsen began playing tennis at age nine, and in his teens became one of the best juniors in the world. He finished as No. 3 in the world in 1991. He turned full-time professional in 1992, and his breakthrough as senior in a major tournament came at the Copenhagen Open where he beat top-20 player Alexander Volkov in the first round. Later that year, he reached the final in Brisbane—it was only his fourth ATP Tour tournament. His debut in the 1993 Australian Open confirmed his position among the best players in the world as he went to the fourth round. The same year he reached his career-best singles ranking as world No. 41 in June. Since 1993, he was for most of the time ranked within the top 100. In 1994, he played the most famous match of his career when he beat Stefan Edberg in five sets at Wimbledon.\n\nIn 1996, he reached the final of the tournament that triggered his career, Copenhagen Open, but lost to Cédric Pioline. The next year, he reached the final in Auckland, but this time lost to Jonas Björkman. This saw his ranking shoot up 20 spots to world No. 52. In 1999, Carlsen reached the final in Newport, but lost to Chris Woodruff.\n\nIn 2000, he suffered from a serious shoulder injury, and underwent surgery twice. As a result, he did not play any tournaments that year. His recovery was relatively slow, and he could not return to professional tennis until June 2001. His long absence from the sport, however, did not seem to affect his playing negatively. In 2002, he won his second ATP tournament in Tokyo, and in 2005 he won the Regions Morgan Keegan Championship in Memphis at almost 32 years old. His resurgence saw him in June 2005 become world No. 50.\n\nCarlsen rarely played doubles, but reached three ATP doubles finals in his career: Copenhagen with Frederik Fetterlein in 1997 (lost to Andrei Olhovskiy/Brett Steven), Tashkent, Uzbekistan with Sjeng Schalken in 1998 (lost to Stefano Pescosolido/Laurence Tieleman), and Beijing with Michael Berrer in 2006 (lost to Mario Ančić/Mahesh Bhupathi).\n\nHe played a total of 46 Grand Slam events during his career, and used to hold the record for most first-round exits for a long time: 30. But he was surpassed by Albert Montañés at 2014 Australian Open where he reached 31 career Grand Slam first-round exits.\n\nOn June 27, 2007, he announced that he would retire from professional tennis, and he played his last ATP match in first round of the Stockholm Open on October 10, 2007. The week after, he played his final professional tennis match at a Challenger tournament in Kolding, Denmark.\n\nIn November 2008, Carlsen was appointed captain of the Denmark Davis Cup team.

{"id": "1804971", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1804971", "title": "Possessive determiner", "text": "Possessive determiner\n\nPossessive determiners (from ; / ktētikós - en. ktetic) constitute a sub-class of determiners which modify a noun by attributing possession (or other sense of belonging) to someone or something. They are also known as possessive adjectives, although the latter term is sometimes used with a wider meaning.\n\nExamples in English include possessive forms of the personal pronouns, namely: \"my\", \"your\", \"his\", \"her\", \"its\", \"our\" and \"their\", but excluding those forms such as \"mine\", \"yours\", \"ours\", and \"theirs\" that are used as possessive pronouns but not as determiners. Possessive determiners may also be taken to include possessive forms made from nouns, from other pronouns and from noun phrases, such as \"John's\", \"the girl's\", \"somebody's\", \"the king of Spain's\", when used to modify a following noun.\n\nIn many languages, possessive determiners are subject to agreement with the noun they modify, as in the French \"mon\", \"ma\", \"mes\", respectively the masculine singular, feminine singular and plural forms corresponding to the English \"my\".\n\nPossessive determiners, as used in English and some other languages, imply the definite article. For example, \"my car\" implies \"the car that belongs to me/is used by me\". (However, \"This is the car I have\" implies that it is the only car you have, whereas \"This is my car\" does not imply that to the same extent. When applied to relatives other than parents or spouse, there is no implication of uniqueness – \"my brother\" can mean equally well \"one of my brothers\" as \"the one brother I have\".) It is not correct to precede possessives with an article (*\"the my car\") or (in today's English) other definite determiner such as a demonstrative (*\"this my car\"), although they can combine with quantifiers in the same ways that \"the\" can (\"all my cars\", \"my three cars\", etc.; see English determiners). This is not the case in all languages; for example in Italian the possessive is usually preceded by another determiner such as an article, as in \"la mia macchina\" (\"my car\", literally \"the my car\").\n\nWhile some classify the words \"my\", \"your\", etc. as possessive adjectives, others, due to the differences noted above, do not consider them adjectives – at least, not in English – and prefer possessive determiners. In some other languages the equivalent parts of speech behave more like true adjectives, however.\n\nThe words \"my\", \"your\", etc. are sometimes classified, along with \"mine\", \"yours\" etc., as possessive pronouns or genitive pronouns, since they are the possessive (or genitive) forms of the ordinary personal pronouns \"I\", \"you\" etc. However, unlike most other pronouns, they do not behave grammatically as stand-alone nouns, but instead qualify another noun – as in \"my book\" (contrasted with \"that's mine\", for example, where \"mine\" substitutes for a complete noun phrase such as \"my book\"). For this reason, other authors restrict the term \"possessive pronoun\" to the group of words \"mine\", \"yours\" etc. that substitute directly for a noun or noun phrase.\n\nSome authors who classify both sets of words as \"possessive pronouns\" or \"genitive pronouns\" apply the terms dependent/independent or weak/strong to refer, respectively, to \"my\", \"your\", etc. and \"mine\", \"yours\", etc. For example, under this scheme, \"my\" is termed a dependent possessive pronoun and \"mine\" an independent possessive pronoun.\n\nIn linguistic terminology, possessive forms are also referred to as ktetic forms, since has its equivalent in (ktētikós). Term ktetic is used in reference to ktetic (possessive) adjectives, and also in reference to other ktetic (possessive) forms, including names derived from ktetics (ktetic personal names).\n\nThe basic pronominal possessive determiners in modern English are \"my\", \"your\", \"his\", \"her\", \"its\", \"our\", \"their\" and \"whose\" (as in \"Whose coat is this?\" and \"the man whose car was stolen\"). As noted above, they indicate definiteness, like the definite article \"the\". Archaic forms include \"thy\" and \"mine/thine\" (for \"my/thy\" before a vowel). For details, see English personal pronouns.\n\nOther possessive determiners (although they may not always be classed as such, though they play the same role in syntax) are the words and phrases formed by attaching the clitic \"-'s\" (or sometimes just an apostrophe after \"-s\") to other pronouns, to nouns and to noun phrases (sometimes called determiner phrases). Examples include \"Jane's\", \"heaven's\", \"the boy's\", \"Jesus',\" \"the soldiers',\" \"those men's\", \"the king of England's\", \"one's\", \"somebody's\".\n\nFor more details of the formation and use of possessives in English, see English possessive. For more details about the use of determiners generally, see English determiners.\n\nThough in English the possessive determiners indicate definiteness, in other languages the definiteness needs to be added separately for grammatical correctness.\n\nIn Norwegian the phrase \"my book\" would be \"boka mi\", where \"boka\" is the definite form of the feminine noun \"bok\" (book), and \"mi\" (my) is the possessive pronoun following feminine singular nouns.\n\nIn some Romance languages such as French and Italian, the gender of the possessive determiners agrees with the thing(s) owned, not with the owner. French, for example, in the singular, uses \"son\" for masculine nouns and also for feminine noun phrases starting with a vowel, \"sa\" elsewhere; compare \"Il a perdu son chapeau\" (\"He lost his hat\") with \"Elle a perdu son chapeau\" (\"She lost her hat\"). In this respect the possessive determiners in these languages resemble ordinary adjectives. French also correlates possessive determiners to both the plurality of the possessor and possessee, as in \"notre voiture\" (our car) and \"nos voitures\" (our cars). In Modern Spanish, however, possessive determiners do not change for gender, e.g. \"mi hijo y mi hija\" (\"my son and my daughter\"), but do change for plurality of the possessee, e.g. \"Mi esposa tiene mis gafas\" (\"My wife has my glasses\"). Spanish possessive \"pronouns\" do agree with gender and plurality of the possessee, e.g. \"Esas niñas son nuestras. Ese bolígrafo es nuestro.\" (\"Those girls are ours. That pen is ours.\").\n\nIn Italian, constructions such as \"il tuo libro nero\" (\"the your book black \", rendered in English as \"your black book\") and \"quel tuo libro nero\" (\"that your book black\", rendered in English as \"that black book of yours\") are grammatically correct. In Italian, the possessive determiners behave in almost every respect like adjectives.\n\nSome Germanic languages, such as English and Dutch, use different pronouns depending on the owner. English has the (uninflected) words \"his\" and \"her\"; Dutch uses the (uninflected) \"zijn\" and \"haar\". Other Germanic languages, such as German and several Dutch dialects including Limburgish and Brabantian, additionally use different forms depending on the grammatical gender of the object owned. German has \"sein\" (with inflected forms like \"seine\") for masculine and \"ihr\" (with inflected forms like \"ihre\") for feminine possessors; in German, the \"hat\" sentences above would be \"Er hat seinen Hut verloren\" (He lost his hat) and \"Sie hat ihren Hut verloren\" (She lost her hat) respectively. Brabantian also inflects \"zijn\" (his) and \"haar\" (her) according to the grammatical gender and number of the thing(s) owned.\n\nSome languages have no distinctive possessive determiners, and express possession by declining personal pronouns in the genitive or possessive case, or by using possessive suffixes or particles. In Japanese, for example, \"boku no\" (a word for \"I\" coupled with the genitive particle \"no\"), is used for \"my\" or \"mine\". In Mandarin Chinese, the possessive determiner and possessive pronoun take the same form as each other: the form associated with \"wǒ\" (\"I\") is \"wǒ de\" (\"my\", \"mine\"), where \"de\" is the possessive particle.\n\nSome languages use the same word for both the possessive determiner and the matching possessive pronoun. For example, in Finnish \"meidän\" can mean either \"our\" or \"ours\".\n\nOn the other hand, some Micronesian languages such as Pohnpeian have a large number of possessive classifiers that reflect both the possessor and the possessum: \"nah pwihk\" means \"his (live) pig;\" \"ah pwihk\" means \"his (butchered) pig;\" and \"kene pwihk\" means \"pork; his pig (to eat).\" As a further example, \"tehnweren ohlo war\" (-n that-man canoe) means \"that man's canoe,\" referring to a person of high status.\n\nFor possessive determiners as elsewhere, the genitive does not always indicate strict \"possession\", but rather a general sense of \"belonging\" or \"close identification with\". Consider the following examples:\n\n\n\n\nPossessive determiners commonly have similar forms to personal pronouns. In addition, they have corresponding possessive pronouns, which are also phonetically similar. The following chart shows the English, German, and French personal pronouns, possessive determiners and possessive pronouns.\n\n\n"}

It was released in the US in March 1967 (Epic Records LN 24239 (monaural) / BN 26239 (rechanneled stereo), but not released in the UK because of a continuing contractual dispute that also prevented \"Sunshine Superman\" from a UK release. In June 1967, a cross-section of both albums was released as \"Sunshine Superman\" (Pye Records NPL 18181) in the UK. \"Mellow Yellow\" was the name of Donovan's hit single released the previous November.\n\nThe songs on \"Mellow Yellow\" represent a transition in Donovan's writing. Donovan's songs had previously illustrated his infatuation with an ability to define the mid-sixties pop music scene. On \"Mellow Yellow\" this is still evident in \"Sunny South Kensington\", \"Museum\" (originally recorded for the \"Sunshine Superman album\" and rerecorded for \"Mellow Yellow\") and the title track, but is also tempered with world-weary observations of that scene (\"Young Girl Blues\"). The contractual problems that prevented the release of Donovan's music in the UK led him to write such songs as the resigned \"Writer in the Sun\", where he contemplates the possibility of his own forced retirement from the music industry at the age of 20.\n\nMickie Most's production and the arrangements of John Paul Jones accommodate these two divergent traits of Donovan's songwriting throughout \"Mellow Yellow\". The peppier songs feature a diverse selection of instruments similar to \"Sunshine Superman\" and helped make a top 10 hit out of the title track on both sides of the Atlantic. The introspective ruminations feature sparse instrumentation that highlights Donovan's guitar playing, singing, and lyrics.\n\nOn \"Mellow Yellow\", Donovan gave a nod to his friend Bert Jansch on \"House of Jansch\", marking the third Donovan album in a row that paid tribute to the British folk personage.\n\nJohn Cameron played blues piano, harpsichord, and undertook arrangements.\n\nPaul McCartney provided background vocals on at least one of the tracks. He is uncredited for his work.\n\nAccording to a recent biography (\"\"Darker Than The Deepest Sea: The Search For Nick Drake\"\"), the album was a significant influence on Nick Drake.\n\nThe track \"Museum\" was covered by Herman's Hermits on their 1967 album release \"Blaze\".\n\n\nAll tracks by Donovan Leitch.

She becomes a part of the events related to the rescue of the Danish Jews, when thousands of Jews were helped to reach neutral ground in Sweden in order to avoid being relocated to concentration camps. She risked her life in order to help her best friend, Ellen Rosen, by pretending that Ellen is Annemarie's late older sister Lise, who had died earlier in the war. Lise had been killed by the Nazi military as a result of her work with the Danish Resistance, though her former fiancé Peter, based in part on Danish resistance member Kim Malthe-Bruun, continues to help them. The story's title is taken from a reference to Psalm 147:4, in which the writer relates that God has numbered all the stars and has named each one of them. It ties into the Star of David, worn by Ellen Rosen on her necklace, which is a symbol of Judaism.\n\nThe novel was awarded the Newbery Medal in 1990 as the previous year's \"most distinguished contribution to American literature for children\". Lois Lowry traveled to Copenhagen to conduct research and interviews for the book. She took the photo of the girl used for the cover (shown in infobox). That cover was used on many editions of the book.\n\nAnnemarie Johansen and her friend, Ellen Rosen, are ten-year-old girls living in Copenhagen, Denmark, during World War II. Annemarie has a 5-year-old sister named Kirsti. There are Nazis on every street corner in Copenhagen. Butter, sugar, coffee, and cigarettes are rationed. \nAfter an encounter with two German soldiers, Annemarie and Ellen are told to be much more careful. Later on, it turns out that for unknown reasons the Germans are \"relocating\" Denmark's Jews. At the synagogue, the Nazis have taken the names and addresses of all the Jewish people in Copenhagen. Ellen and her family are Jewish. Ellen's parents have fled with Peter, the former fiancé of Annemarie's older sister, Lise, who died years before. Ellen must stay with the Johansens, pretending to be Lise, even though she is half the age of the real Lise. Soldiers enter the Johansens' apartment at 4 in the morning, thinking that the Rosens are \"Paying a visit\" to the Johansens. Annemarie and Ellen wake up and Annemarie breaks the Star of David necklace off Ellen's neck. If the soldiers had seen it, they would have known Ellen was a Jew. The soldiers see Ellen's dark hair and become suspicious because the Johansens have blond hair, and Ellen has brown hair. Luckily, Lise had brown hair as an infant. Mr. Johansen shows the Nazis a picture of baby Lise, and they leave.\n\nMrs. Johansen, Annemarie, Ellen, and Kirsti leave the next morning to go to Uncle Henrik's house by the sea. Sweden, a Nazi-free country, can be seen from Uncle Henrik's house. Before they had gone to his house, Mr. Johansen had spoken in code to Henrik. When they get there, Henrik seems like his ordinary self. The next day, Henrik says that Annemarie's Great-Aunt Birte has died. A huge casket is placed in the middle of the living room. Annemarie knows that there is no Aunt Birte, but learns from her uncle that it is easier to be brave if you do not know something, so she does not tell Ellen the truth about her \"aunt\".\n\nLater on, many people come to mourn \"Aunt Birte\", to Annemarie's puzzlement. Nazis come to the house and see all the people and start questioning the family. They explain that Great-Aunt Birte has died, and they are carrying out traditional rituals. The Nazis order the casket opened, and Mrs. Johansen acts fast. She says that Great-Aunt Birte had typhus, a very contagious and dangerous disease, or so the doctor said. She goes to the casket to open it, but one of the soldiers slaps her in the face and says they can open it when the soldiers leave. \n\nAfter they leave, the wake continues. Peter, who is present, reads the beginning of Psalm 147 from the Bible to the group, recounting the Lord God numbering the stars. As the psalm is not familiar to Annemarie, her thoughts begin to wander. She wonders how it is possible to number the stars in the sky and remembers Ellen saying that her mother is afraid of the ocean because her mother thinks it is cold and cruel. Annemarie thinks that the night sky and the world are also cold and cruel. Peter opens the casket and gives the warm clothing and blankets concealed within it to the Jewish families. They depart in smaller groups to avoid attracting attention. Ellen says goodbye to Annemarie and her mother.\n\nIn the morning, Annemarie sees her mother crawling in the distance because she had broken her ankle. After helping her mother back to the house, Annemarie finds a packet of great importance to the Resistance, a packet which Mr. Rosen dropped when he accidentally tripped on a flight of stairs. Mrs. Johansen tells Annemarie to fill a basket with food and the packet, and run as fast as she can. Annemarie runs off onto a wooded path in the direction of her uncle's boat. She is halted by Nazi soldiers with dogs. When they question Annemarie about what she is doing out so early, she lies, saying that she is taking a basket with a meal to her uncle. The soldiers do not believe her, and one of them grabs at the basket. However, the soldiers eventually let her go, and Annemarie makes it to her uncle's boat. She gives Uncle Henrik an envelope that contains a handkerchief. The handkerchief had traces of cocaine on it to numb the dog's sense of smell. When the Nazi dogs took onto the boat sniff the handkerchief, they can no longer smell Uncle Henrik's hidden \"cargo\": the Jewish people he is smuggling to safety.\n\nUncle Henrik returns to Denmark later that evening from Sweden. He tells Annemarie that many Jewish people, including the Rosens, were hiding in his boat. He also explains that the handkerchief in her package contained the scent of rabbit blood, which attracted the dogs, and the strong odor of cocaine, which numbs their noses, preventing them from tracking down the Jews in Henrik's boat. Several revelations are made, including that Peter is in the Danish Resistance.\n\nTwo years later, the war in Europe ends, and all of Denmark celebrates. The Jews who were forced to leave Denmark will find that their friends and neighbors have kept up their apartments in hopes of their return. Peter had been captured and executed by the Nazis in the town square earlier in the war, after which Annemarie learned that her sister Lise died, not in an accident, but because the Nazis intentionally hit her with a military car: she was also in the Resistance. It is unknown whether Ellen or her parents return to Copenhagen.\n\nCritical and popular reactions were positive. \"Kirkus Reviews\" said that \"...like Annemarie, the reader is protected from the full implications of events--but will be caught up in the suspense and menace of several encounters with soldiers and in Annemarie's courageous run as a courier on the night of the escape.\"\n\nIn addition to winning numerous awards, the book has been one of the best-selling children's books of all time. According to \"Publishers Weekly\", it was the 82nd best selling children's book of all time in the United States with sales above 2 million as of 2001. Sales have remained solid, even years after publication.\n\nIn 1996, Doug Larche, with the editorial assistance of Susan Elliott, wrote a dramatic adaptation of \"Number the Stars\" which was published by The Dramatic Publishing Company of Woodstock, Illinois. The work has had over 250 productions, including opening two Holocaust Museums and playing two summers at the Danish International Immigrant Museum. It continues to be produced at major youth and regional theatres, as well as community, university, college, high school, middle school and academy theatres around the world. In 1998, The Dramatic Publishing Company released \"Number the Stars A Musical Play\", adapted by Sean Hartley.\n\nIn September 2017, actor Sean Astin announced that he had spent the last ten years attempting to get a film adaptation greenlit.\n\n\n"}

Grünberg which first lived in Dysina (Dýšina) to the east of Pilsen. Grünberg was a Catholic.\n\nAfter the war, the family was interned; the parents were brought to a camp. His father, a Russia-born engineer who since 1928 had worked for Škoda, died on 27 November 1945 in Czech imprisonment and is buried in a mass grave in Pilsen which is also inscribed with \"Grünberg Theodor † 27. November 1945\". His mother Anna (who died in 2002 aged 100) had to work in agriculture and stayed with her parents in the Petermann house in Untersekerschan (Dolní Sekyřany), where her children (a sister was born in 1937) were brought later. The remaining Grünberg family, like almost all Germans, was expelled from Czechoslovakia in 1946. Seven-year-old Peter came to Lauterbach, Hesse where he attended gymnasium.\n\nGrünberg received his intermediate diploma in 1962 from the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt. He then attended the Technische Universität Darmstadt, where he received his diploma in physics in 1966 and his Ph.D. in 1969. While there, he met and married his wife, Helma Prauser, who became a schoolteacher. From 1969 to 1972, he did postdoctoral work at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada. He later joined the Institute for Solid State Physics at Forschungszentrum Jülich, where he became a leading researcher in the field of thin film and multilayer magnetism until his retirement in 2004.\n\nIn 1986 he discovered the antiparallel exchange coupling between ferromagnetic layers separated by a thin non-ferromagnetic layer, and in 1988 he discovered the giant magnetoresistive effect (GMR). GMR was simultaneously and independently discovered by Albert Fert from the Université de Paris Sud. It has been used extensively in read heads of modern hard drives. Another application of the GMR effect is non-volatile, magnetic random access memory.\n\nApart from the Nobel Prize, Grünberg's work also has been rewarded with shared prizes in the APS International Prize for New Materials, the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics Magnetism Award, the Hewlett-Packard Europhysics Prize, the Wolf Prize in Physics and the 2007 Japan Prize. He won the German Future Prize for Technology and Innovation in 1998 and was named European Inventor of the Year in the category \"Universities and research institutions\" by the European Patent Office and European Commission in 2006.\n\n"}

The parish was canonically erected in 1916, when Father Ulrich Taube, SS.CC., built the first wooden church that was consecrated that same year under the title of Saint Anthony of Padua by Msgr. Libert H. Boeynaems, SS.CC., Vicar Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands. Father Ulrich commuted daily from the downtown Honolulu rectory at the Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace, serving the faithful of Kalihi Kai until his resignation due to illness in 1927.\n\nMsgr. Stephen Alencastre, SS.CC., Vicar Apostolic, appointed Father Hubert Nijs, SS.CC., as the second pastor of the parish. Father Hubert moved into a rectory cottage next to the church and became the first resident priest in Kalihi Kai. Plantation workers and laborers moving into Kalihi Kai since the turn of the century resulted in a substantial increase in population. In an area where most of the faithful lacked basic education, Father Hubert announced the opening of a parish school and converted the medium-sized parish hall into two rooms. Two Maryknoll nuns volunteered to staff the school with an enrollment of 128 students in the first and second grades that opened on September 2, 1928. These two sisters made a daily commute from their convent located near Punahou School. Five more Maryknoll nuns joined the school in 1929 and Father Hubert purchased the adjacent property across Kaumualii Street and built a two-story convent for the sisters.\n\nThe school facilities were expanded as Father Hubert continued to purchase adjacent lots. Father Hubert also erected a three-room school building and made improvements to the convent. In 1947, during the episcopate of Msgr. James Sweeney, Father Hubert razed the old rectory cottage and built a new three story school next to a new rectory. In 1950, Msgr. Sweeney approved the assignment by the Provincial Superior of the Sacred Hearts Fathers of Father Maurice Coopman, SS.CC., as the pastor of Saint Anthony parish. Father Maurice labored patiently, and erased the parish debt accrued during the building of the school and rectory. Father Maurice was retired in 1962 due to illness and Father Anselm Ernest Gouveia, SS.CC., was appointed pastor after serving the faithful as pastor in Kaneohe.\n\nThe wooden church built in 1916 was razed in 1967 to make way for a new concrete church designed by Ray Akagi at a cost of $226,800. Designed with a semicircular floor plan, a domed roof, and replete with beautiful ecclesiastical appointments including a mosaic depicting the baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist, floral stained glass windows, and various other stained-glass windows depicting various events in the history of the parish and the diocese, and walnut pews manufactured by the Trappist monks of Lafayette, Indiana the new church was consecrated on August 25, 1968 by Msgr. John J. Scanlan, Bishop of Honolulu.\n\nThe parish campus includes an elementary school as well as a convent and rectory. The school is staffed by the Philippine province of the Congregation of the Sisters of St. Paul of Chartres and lay staff. The parish is staffed by the clergy of the Missionaries of La Salette.\n\n"}
