It exists in two major versions of 1887 and 1890. It was premiered under conductor Hans Richter in 1892 in Vienna. It is dedicated to the Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria.\n\nThis symphony is sometimes nicknamed \"The Apocalyptic\", but this was not a name Bruckner gave to the work himself.\n\nBruckner began work on the Eighth Symphony in July 1884. Working mainly during the summer vacations from his duties at the University of Vienna and the Vienna Conservatory, the composer had all four movements completed in draft form by August 1885. The orchestration of the work took Bruckner until April 1887 to complete: during this stage of composition the order of the inner movements was reversed, leaving the scherzo second and the Adagio as the third movement.\n\nIn September 1887 Bruckner had the score copied and sent to conductor Hermann Levi. Levi was one of Bruckner's closest collaborators, having given a performance of the Seventh Symphony in Munich that was \"the greatest triumph Bruckner had yet experienced\". He had also arranged for Bruckner's career to be supported in other ways, including financial assistance from the nobility, and an honorary doctorate from the University of Vienna. However the conductor wrote back to Bruckner that:\n\nI find it impossible to perform the Eighth in its current form. I just can't make it my own! As much as the themes are magnificent and direct, their working-out seems to me dubious; indeed, I consider the orchestration quite impossible... Don't lose your courage, take another look at your work, talk it over with your friends, with Schalk, maybe a reworking can achieve something.\n\nBy January 1888, Bruckner had come to agree with Levi that the symphony would benefit from further work. Early work of revision was carried out in the first movement and the Scherzo, expressed as pencil notations in their score. A distinct version of the Adagio – now called the “intermediate Adagio” or “Adagio of 1888” – was also retrieved and edited in 2004 by Dermot Gault and Takanobu Kawasaki. Thereafter Bruckner concentrated on the new versions of the Fourth and Third. He began work on the final version of the Adagio in March 1889 and completed the new version of the symphony in March 1890.\n\nOnce the new version was completed, the composer wrote to Emperor Franz Josef I for permission to dedicate the symphony to him. The emperor accepted Bruckner's request and also offered to help pay for the work's publication. Bruckner had some trouble finding a publisher for the work, but in late 1890 the Haslinger-Schlesinger-Lienau company agreed to undertake publication. Bruckner's associates Josef Schalk and Max von Oberleithner assisted with the publication process: Schalk prepared the musical text to be sent to the printer while Oberleithner corrected the proofs and also provided financial support. The symphony was eventually published in March 1892. It was the only one of Bruckner's symphonies to be published before its first performance.\n\nBy the time the 1890 revision was complete Levi was no longer conducting concerts in Munich: as a result he recommended that his protege Felix Weingartner, Kapellmeister of Mannheim, lead the first performance of the symphony. The premiere was twice scheduled to occur under the young conductor's direction during 1891, but each time Weingartner substituted another work at the last minute. Eventually the conductor told Bruckner that he was unable to undertake the performance because he was about to take up a new position at the Berlin Opera. However, Weingartner admitted, in a letter to Levi, that the real reason he was unable to perform the symphony was because the work was too difficult and he did not have enough rehearsal time: in particular, the Wagner tuba players in his orchestra did not have enough experience to cope with their parts.\n\nAfter a Munich performance by Levi was canceled because of a feared outbreak of cholera, Bruckner focused his efforts on securing a Vienna premiere for the symphony. At last Hans Richter, subscription conductor of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, agreed to conduct the work. The first performance took place on 18 December 1892. Although some of the more conservative members of the audience left at the end of each movement, many of Bruckner's supporters were also present, including Hugo Wolf and Johann Strauss.\n\nThe well known critic Eduard Hanslick left after the slow movement. His review described the symphony as \"interesting in detail, but strange as a whole, indeed repellent. The peculiarity of this work consists, to put it briefly, in importing Wagner's dramatic style into the symphony.\" (Korstvedt points out that this was less negative than Hanslick's reviews of Bruckner's earlier symphonies.) There were also many positive reviews from Bruckner's admirers. One anonymous writer described the symphony as \"the crown of music in our time\". Hugo Wolf wrote to a friend that the symphony was \"the work of a giant\" that \"surpasses the other symphonies of the master in intellectual scope, awesomeness, and greatness\".\n\nThe symphony was slow to enter the orchestral repertoire. Only two further performances occurred during Bruckner's lifetime. The American premiere did not take place until 1909, while the symphony had to wait until 1929 for its first London performance.\n\nThe symphony has four movements. The total duration varies by performance and the edition of the score used, but is typically around 80 minutes.\n\nThe symphony begins in a tonally ambiguous manner with a theme rhythmically reminiscent of the main theme of the first movement of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 in D minor and of the March in D minor of 1862. According to theorist Heinrich Schenker this passage is \"like the beginning of the world.\"\n\\relative c {\n</score>\nA more song-like second subject group uses the Bruckner rhythm:\n\\relative c' {\n</score>\nThe third subject group, which is strikingly dissonant, forms a smooth transition to the development:\n\\relative c' {\n</score>\nIn structure, the opening movement is therefore a typically Brucknerian three-subject sonata form, though handled with more panache than in his previous works. The development was substantially refined in 1890. In both versions, this section of the movement contains a massive, augmented three-part statement of the main theme, impressively given on full orchestra in combination with the Bruckner rhythm of the second subject group.\nThis combination of the main two themes of the exposition rises pitch-wise by a third until the orchestra drops away, leaving a single flute accompanied by a timpano.\n\nIn the recapitulation, the third theme leads to a great climax for the entire orchestra, in which the bare rhythm of the main theme is dominant:\n\\relative c {\n</score>\nThis suddenly breaks off, leaving just the trumpets and three of the horns hammering out the rhythm, timpani thundering beneath. When the strings and woodwinds rejoin, it is in a very dejected mood. At this juncture the two versions differ significantly. In the 1887 version, this solemn passage leads to what many consider an unconvincingly premature victory coda, which sounds the main theme in C major. For the 1890 version, the triumphant ending was cut, and the despondent passage extended by a few bars to form a pianissimo coda in itself (thus becoming the only instance of a first movement ending softly in Bruckner's symphonic œuvre). This quiet, sombre ending is for low winds and low strings in a thoroughly bleak C minor, and there is no doubt from contemporary letters of Bruckner that it represented death in some way.\n\nIt has been suggested by some scholars that the coda was inspired by the climax of the Dutchman's monologue in Wagner's \"Der fliegende Hollander\", with the words, \"Ihr Welten endet euren Lauf, ewige Vernichtung, nimm mich auf!\".\n\nThe five-note \"Deutscher Michel\" theme, accompanied by tremolo figures in the upper strings, is a reminiscence of the \"Credo\" of the Mass in E minor:\n\\relative c {\n</score>\nThe main part of the Scherzo is fundamentally the same in both versions, though somewhat more repetitive in the first version. The orchestration and dynamics are more refined in the second version, helping to give the movement a rich and original sound. The Trios, however, are quite different: the 1890 version was rewritten as an adumbration of the ensuing Adagio movement, featuring the harps, and the tempo was slowed down:\n\\relative c\" {\n</score>\nThis Scherzo is Bruckner's largest, lasting around 14 or 15 minutes in most performances.\n\nThe main difference between versions is at the climax, for which in the 1887 version Bruckner managed to insert six cymbal clashes. He must have thought that excessive, as he pared it down to two in the 1890 version. The key of this climax was also altered from C major in 1887 to E-flat major in 1890. The coda of this movement is recalled in the coda of the Adagio of the Ninth Symphony.\n\nThis Adagio differs from those in other symphonies by the composer in that the second thematic group is not presented in a more flowing tempo. The two themes are, first, a recollection of the slow movement of Schubert's Wanderer Fantasie for Pianoforte and an answering descending passage, both over throbbing, richly scored strings; and, secondly, a tonally unstable passage radiant with ecstasy. The structure and scale of the Adagio as it develops these themes is grander than any of Bruckner's previous slow movements.\n\nThe movement opens in an unusual way; while it is in time, the string accompaniment is made up of a mix of uneven triplets and eighth notes. Simon Rattle describes this as a \"fascinating rhythmic hall of mirrors.\"\n\\relative c\" {\n</score>\nThis eventually leads to a great chorale in the strings that starts in G major but leads to F major:\n\\relative c' {\n</score>\nThe second part of the movement begins with a cello melody:\n\\relative c' {\n</score>\n\nThe Adagio is the most controversial of all the movements in terms of different versions. For example, Robert Haas inserted one quiet, solemn passage in his edition of the 1890 score which restored a cut between two loud passages (before the main climax of the movement), whereas in the Leopold Nowak edition these two loud passages are joined. This difference greatly affects the impression given to the listener for this section of the movement as it heads towards the great E major climax. The 1890 Adagio, in both the edition of Robert Haas and that of Leopold Nowak, remains shorter than the 1887 original.\n\nBeginning belligerently (by Bruckner's standards), this movement reaches a triumphant conclusion using themes (or at least rhythmic impressions of these) from all four movements. The form of this movement is complex, derived from a three-subject sonata structure but, like the opening movement of Symphony No. 7, highly individualised. The scale and complexity of this movement are both on a different level from that in the opening of the Seventh Symphony, however, not least in that this movement must synthesise the entire symphony (as it reworks old ideas and new ones into a coherent whole), and forms what must be a satisfactory conclusion for the whole work.\n\nThe opening theme is a powerful chorale, originally given over a march, in which the rhythmic thundering of the timpani recalls certain passages in the opening movement:\n\\relative c {\n</score>\nThe second subject, a song theme, is remarkable in that it recollects not only its counterpart in the first movement but also the Adagio:\n\\relative c\" {\n</score>\nThe third subject is a march theme, which is a direct reworking of the introduction to the third subject group of the opening movement:\n\\relative c {\n</score>\nIn the recapitulation, this third theme is presented as a fugue which leads to the solemn coda and the splendid, bright finish to the symphony.\n\nThe development presents these three themes and other elements in ways which recollect earlier parts of the symphony, both episodically and in simultaneously parallel combinations. The thematic treatment is subtle and counterpoint is frequently used in the presentation of themes. It therefore seems natural that such a synthesis concludes by contrapuntally combining all the main themes of the symphony: the coda begins in a solemn C minor in which the opening theme of the Finale reaches a powerful climax. This is answered quietly by the woodwind giving out the same theme, then more optimistically by the full orchestra, from which, in a flurry of trumpets and timpani, the Scherzo theme heralds a remarkably succinct combination of all the themes in C major:\n\\relative c {\n</score>\nFor all its grandeur, the ending is remarkably concise, and the perorations are more terse than those of, say, Bruckner's own Symphony No. 5 in B flat major.\n\nTwo complete autograph manuscripts of the symphony exist, dating from 1887 and 1890 respectively. More sketches exist from all phases of work on this symphony than for most of Bruckner's works. For example, thanks to the sketches, we can see the evolution of the opening theme. Part scores show that the tonal ambiguity of the symphony's opening was not how Bruckner originally envisaged the main theme: the rhythm was to fit an arpeggiated contour in C minor. The final opening is much less defined and hovers in more of a B-flat major region, though it suggests several keys.\n\nThis was Bruckner's first version of the symphony, but was not published until 1972 in an edition edited by Leopold Nowak.\nThere are enormous variants in orchestration, harmony, voice leading and motivic treatment between the two versions. In some sections one can almost speak of two different pieces, rather than two versions of the same work. Some significant differences from the more familiar later versions include a loud ending to the first movement and a different tonality for the climax of the slow movement. It is also notably longer than the 1890 version, and has a different instrumentation (the most significant consistent difference being that the 1890 version has triple rather than double woodwind throughout the first three movements). The double woodwind of the 1887 version gives a somewhat more austere character to the overall sound of the work. Some scholars support this version of the symphony. Bryan Gilliam, for example, argues that the later version (from 1890) is shorter and smoother, and is hence a dubious concession to the Brahms-loving bourgeoisie of the time.\n\nThe 1887 version was premiered by Hans-Hubert Schönzeler for the BBC in 1973, and has thereafter been recorded by Dennis Russell Davies, Vladimir Fedoseyev, Eliahu Inbal, Georg Tintner, Michael Gielen, Kent Nagano, Simone Young, Franz Welser-Möst and Fabio Luisi.\n\nA digitalisation of the North-American premiere of the 1887 version by Tintner with the National Youth Orchestra of Canada, Kingston, Ontario (Canada), 31 August 1982 (LP: Jubal 5003/4, 1982), and of a 2009 live performance by Gennadi Rozhdestvensky with the Bolshoi Orchestra can be heard on John Berky's website.\n\nThe new edition by Paul Hawkshaw has been premiered by Peter Oundjian with the Yale Symphony Orchestra on 27 October 2017.\n\nA copy of an intermediate version of the Adagio with an estimated date of 1888 exists in the Austrian National Library. This Adagio, which already requires triple woodwind, has been edited by Dermot Gault and Takanobu Kawasaki and recorded by Akira Naito with the Tokyo New City Orchestra. A MIDI version is also available.\nIntermediate versions of the other movements have been edited by Carragan and performed by Gerd Schaller.\nThis account of the Eighth was founded on individual, possibly non-contemporaneous manuscripts rather than one complete copy. … Thus it will always have to be regarded as experimental, not on the same editorial level as the firmly-established manuscript versions of 1887 and 1890 and the printed version of 1892. But in it we have a fascinating view of the work-in-progress of Bruckner the eternal reviser, looking for the most expressive realization of his lofty thoughts and melodic inspiration.\n\nSome scholars such as Deryck Cooke and Robert Haas have suggested that the 1890 revision was the product of Bruckner's insecurity and pressure from his colleagues such as Josef Schalk. Cooke even referred to it as the \"Bruckner-Schalk revision\". Against this, Leopold Nowak pointed out that there is no evidence of handwriting in the 1890 manuscript other than Bruckner's own; according to testimony of his friends and associates, the composer was resistant to interference. The scoring is fuller and more grandiloquent than in 1887, with subtler textures and harmonies in the woodwind in particular, allowed for by the increased size of this section of the orchestra. The 1890 version was published in 1955 as edited by Nowak.\n\nThis was the first publication of the symphony, and was also the version used at the first performance. It contains some relatively minor changes from the 1890 manuscript, the most notable being a six-bar cut and a two-bar repeated passage in the Finale. The alterations were made by Joseph Schalk and Max von Oberleithner, almost certainly without Bruckner's direct involvement, but were probably approved by the composer before publication. Korstvedt writes that \"while the 1892 edition may not be \"pure Bruckner\" – whatever that might be – to all appearances Bruckner authorized it, and for that reason it needs to be taken seriously.\" This edition is available in complete recordings by Wilhelm Furtwängler, Hans Knappertsbusch, Josef Krips, William Steinberg, George Szell, Bruno Walter and Takeo Noguchi. Serge Koussevitzky also used this edition in his severely cut broadcast performance of 1947; this performance, which has been preserved on disc, amounts to a wholly new \"edition\".\n\nRobert Haas published his edition of the Eighth Symphony in 1939. He based it on the 1890 autograph but included passages from 1887 that had been changed or omitted. The \"Gesamtausgabe\" describes it as a “Mischform,” or mixed form. Nevertheless it remains a beloved and, perhaps, the most frequently played and recorded edition of the work.\n\nHaas argued that Levi’s comments were a crippling blow to Bruckner’s artistic confidence, even leading him to \"entertain suicidal notions\", although Haas had no evidence for this. This led, Haas maintained, to Bruckner’s three-year effort to revise the Eighth Symphony and many of his earlier works. This line of thought supports Haas’ editorial methods. Haas took what he admired from Bruckner's different versions and rolled them into his own version. He justified the rejection of various features of Bruckner’s 1890 revision on biographical grounds: they are the ideas of a Bruckner who mistrusted his own judgment, and therefore non-Brucknerian.\n\nThe most significant omissions that Bruckner made (and therefore of Haas's restorations) are in the Adagio and Finale of the work. In addition, Haas inserted into the finale a transitional passage of eight bars from a sketch found in the library of the Kremsmünster Abbey (A-KR C56-14e1), discarding five bars of Bruckner's own revision. Korstvedt has described these interventions as \"exceed[ing] reasonable limits of scholarly responsibility\".\n\nDespite its dubious scholarship, Haas's edition has proved enduringly popular: conductors such as Herbert von Karajan, Bernard Haitink and Günter Wand continued to use it even after the Nowak/1890 edition was published, while noted Bruckner conductor Georg Tintner has written that the Haas edition is \"the best\" version of the symphony and referred to Haas himself as \"brilliant\". On the other hand, Eugen Jochum used Haas's edition for his first recording, made in 1949, before Nowak published his edition, and Nowak's for his subsequent recordings, while Wilhelm Furtwängler, despite having given the premiere of the Haas score, reverted to the 1892 edition in his final years.\n\nThe controversy over the Haas edition centers on the fact that its musical text was a fabrication of the editor never approved by Bruckner himself. In particular, Nowak, who succeeded Haas as principal editor of the Bruckner complete works, argued that there is little evidence for the psychological breakdown that Haas claimed Bruckner suffered upon Levi's rejection of the work. Bruckner's letters at the time suggest that he was frustrated by Levi’s judgment (dismissing Levi as having a \"hard time grasping things\") and psychologically healthy. Bruckner's revisions, according to this view, are the result of his artistic perfectionism. Nowak therefore rejected Haas's approach by sticking closely to Bruckner's autograph scores.\n\nAs noted above, under the discussion of versions, Nowak left in 1955 an edition of the 1890 version and in 1972 an edition of the 1887 version.\n\nBoth versions will be published in the new Collected Edition. The new edition corrects enough mistakes in the older print. Nevertheless, it is still very much the same score.\n\nThe 1887 version requires an instrumentation of three each of the following woodwind: flutes, a piccolo in the climax of the Adagio, and doubling the third flute in the Finale, oboes, clarinets, bassoons (the third doubling as contrabassoon in the Finale), and eight horns – the triple woodwinds and horns 5 to 8, however, only enter in the Finale (with double woodwind and four horns for the earlier movements) – in addition to three trumpets, three trombones, a quartet of Wagner tubas and a single contrabass tuba, along with timpani, cymbals, triangle, three harps, and strings.The 1890 version deletes the piccolo part, and extends the triple woodwinds and calls for eight horns on all four movements. Horns 5 to 8 replace the Wagner tubas in most of the first and third movements, doubling as Wagner tubas at some points of the symphony.This is the only symphony where Bruckner employs the harp. This was, in total, the largest orchestra Bruckner ever used (since the Ninth Symphony, which uses an otherwise identical orchestra, does not require harps and percussion other than timpani).\n\nIn an 1891 letter to conductor Felix Weingartner, Bruckner gave extramusical associations to several parts of the symphony:\nIn the first movement, the trumpet and horn passage based on the rhythm of the [main] theme in the \"Todesverkündigung\" [the annunciation of death], which gradually grows stronger, and finally emerges very strongly. At the end: surrender.\n\nScherzo: Main theme – named \"deutscher Michel\". In the second part, the fellow wants to sleep, and in his dreamy state cannot find his tune: finally, he plaintively turns back.\n\nFinale: At the time our Emperor received the visit of the Czars at Olmütz; thus, strings: the Cossacks; brass: military music; trumpets: fanfares, as the Majesties meet. In closing, all themes … thus as \"deutscher Michel\" arrives home from his journey, everything is already gloriously brilliant. In the Finale there is also the death march and then (brass) transfiguration.\nBruckner's associates report other comments that the composer is said to have made about the symphony. The coda to the first movement is \"how it is when one is on his deathbed, and opposite hangs a clock, which, while his life comes to an end, beats on ever steadily: tick, tock, tick, tock\" while in the slow movement \"I have gazed too deeply into a maiden's eyes\".\n\nIn an unsigned programme note at the 1892 first performance Joseph Schalk elaborated Bruckner's program, adding references to Greek mythology (Aeschylus's Prometheus, Zeus or Cronus, etc.) mixed with a few Christian references such as the Archangel Michael.\n\nOver the recorded lifetime of this symphony, significantly different approaches have been taken, including tempo choices and the choice of score.\n\nWilhelm Furtwängler, in a live performance with the Vienna Philharmonic in 1944 used a modified Haas edition.\n\nOn 29 September 1944, the Preussische Staatskapelle Berlin, conducted by Herbert von Karajan, recorded the last three movements of the 8th Symphony with the finale in experimental stereophonic sound. In his interpretation Karajan kept strict metre whereas \"recordings from the 1940s … typically present this passage [the reprise of the third subject group in the finale] as a grand accelerando-rallentando, with a tempo increase of as much as 20 percent,\" while Karajan's recording \"is a notable exception.\"\n\nThe first commercial recording of the complete symphony was made by Eugen Jochum with the Hamburg State Philharmonic Orchestra in 1949 for Deutsche Grammophon. Jochum later recorded it in studio with the Berlin Philharmonic in 1964 for Deutsche Grammophon, and in 1976 with the Dresden Staatskapelle for EMI using the Nowak 1890 edition both times. Karl Böhm, in a studio recording with the Vienna Philharmonic in 1976 for Deutsche Grammophon used the Nowak 1890 edition, but with one Haas passage in the finale.\n\nIn the last two decades of the 20th century, recordings tended to \"set a broader basic tempo, … abstain from dramatic tempo fluctuations – especially increases – and place great store by fullness of tone, precise ensemble, and textural clarity.\"\n\nTypically, this work lasts about 80 minutes, although there are performances running as long as 103 minutes. Herbert von Karajan and the aforementioned Günter Wand each recorded the Haas hybrid version more than once. After Eliahu Inbal recorded the 1887 version for the first time, other conductors have followed. Takashi Asahina has recorded a disc comparing excerpts from the Haas and Nowak editions.\n\n\n"}

Following this, the protagonist finds himself repeatedly experiencing the same misfortunes he passed on to the old woman.\n\nThemes of the occult, youthful sexuality, and schoolyard bullying and profanity are explored in the novel, and its resulting suppression has garnered its position 49 on the American Library Association's list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990-2000.\n\nIn a 1989 suburban town, a boy named David tries to get in the cool group by helping his friend Scott, and two troublemakers named Roger and Randy (the former being the leader) carry out a prank. Their target is an elderly woman who was called a witch by all the kids in the school. When they attack her and steal her cane David flips her off to try to impress Roger. But when they leave the old lady's house, she cries out to David \"Your Doppelgänger will regurgitate on your soul!\" The following days David finds himself experiencing strange happenings that lead him to believe that he is cursed. After being rejected by Roger and his gang, David finds himself becoming a loser.

His actions lead Roger's gang to target him and his friends, calling them \"The Three Stooges\". He becomes friendly with a cute girl named Tori Williams, but his pants fall down when he gets the courage to ask her for her phone number. Finally, his younger brother Ricky, after being ridiculed by Roger's younger brother, loses all respect for David.\n\nEventually, David begs the elderly woman to remove the curse, but she asks for her cane to be returned first. As it turns out, Tori doesn't scorn David for his humiliation in having his pants fall down in front of her, and tries to pretend that she had her eyes closed in thought when it happened, to prevent David from becoming uncomfortable around her. David finally decides to fight for his dignity, and, with his friends and little brother by his side, he goes to face Roger's gang and get the cane back, not suspecting that many things, including the curse, are not as they seem. Mo, Tori, Larry, David and his little brother all go to Roger's house for the fight. They get the cane and bring it back to the 'witch' who turns out to be Tori's great-aunt. The aunt is not a witch and there was no curse but David was feeling so bad that sub-consciously he does the things to himself that had happened to the old lady. At the end of the book, 150 years later, a boy named Willy, who is similarly bullied, idolizes David, who is now a famous historical figure. \n"}

After a few detonate in its stomach, Varan is mortally wounded and escapes back into the ocean. After final bomb explodes, Varan is defeated.\n\nVaran reappears in \"Destroy All Monsters\" living in Monsterland with many other monsters including Godzilla, Mothra, Kumonga, Anguirus, Baragon, Minilla, Rodan, Gorosaurus, and Manda. Varan is seen in the wide screen version of the film, gliding in to join the other Earth monsters to fight against King Ghidorah, although it does not actually take part in the fight. Within the context of the film itself it is only seen on Monsterland's monitors early in the film, gliding down to the ground prior to the climatic fight at the end of the movie, and in the last scene gliding up into the air as a static model rather than as an actor in a suit. It is never mentioned by name in this film and its roar is not heard.\n\nVaran makes a cameo in \"\" using stock footage from \"Varan the Unbelievable\" during the narrative at the beginning, claiming that Varan was one of many monsters that arose due to the devastation that the World Wars brought, along with Gezora, Baragon, Gaira, Titanosaurus, and Megaguirus.\n\nVaran is 50 meters (164 feet) tall and weighs 15,000 metric tons (16,534 short tons).\n\nEiji Tsuburaya and Akira Watanabe based Varan's design on that of a \"Draco\" lizard, Godzilla, and a kappa. The name \"Varan\" is derived from \"Varanus pater\", or \"father of lizards.\" However, it may also be named after the genus of monitor lizards \"Varanus\". In its film appearances, Varan does not have any special abilities such as fiery or radioactive breath. It can however glide at speeds of Mach 1.5, and has a row of spines along its body which may afford protection.\n\nFew figures of Varan have been issued compared to other kaiju film monsters. Bullmark released the first ever Varan vinyl toy in 1970. Bandai has only issued Varan in gashapon form as part of High Grade Series 6, in promotion for the film \"Godzilla 2000\". Y-MSF has also released a figure on the 6\" scale in 2005. Other companies, such as CCP, Marmit, Trendmasters, and the modern version of Marusan have also released Varan figures.\n\nIn one of the early drafts of what would become \"Godzilla vs. Gigan\", Varan was to have joined Godzilla and Rodan in defending the Earth against King Ghidorah, Gigan, and a new monster that had never been seen before with the name Mogu. Shusuke Kaneko, director of the popular Heisei Gamera trilogy had originally considered Varan, along with Anguirus, to star in \"\" as antagonists to Godzilla. Varan and Anguirus were however replaced with the far more popular Mothra and King Ghidorah. The suit designer is said to have compromised by giving some of Varan's facial features to King Ghidorah. \n\n\n\n"}

He came from a humble family from the province of Kii or Ōmi, and died in Hakone on September 1, 1502. Sōgi was a Zen monk from the Shokokuji temple in Kyoto and he studied poetry, both waka and renga. In his 30s he became a professional renga poet. \n\nDuring his travels to almost every corner of Japan, he was welcomed by the most powerful political, military and literary figures of his day. He attracted more disciples than any other poet of his generation. After traveling throughout Japan, he returned to Kyoto where he commanded great respect.\n\nHe is best-remembered for his renga, wherein two or more poets collaborate to create a poem, by writing alternate stanzas. In Sōgi's day, such renga were typically 100 verses in length. Arising from the court tradition of waka, renga was cultivated by the warrior class as well as by courtiers, and some of the best renga poets, such as Sōgi, were commoners. \n\nSōgi is considered the greatest master of renga, his two most famous works being \"Three Poets at Minase\" (\"Minase sangin hyakuin\", 1488) and \"Three Poets at Yuyama\" (\"Yuyama sangin hyakuin\", 1491). This outstanding poet left more than 90 works (anthologies, diaries, poetic criticisms and manuals, among others). Before his death, he wrote \"Sōgi Alone\", which mostly includes his memoirs.\n"}

{"id": "2011912", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2011912", "title": "Retail therapy", "text": "Retail therapy\n\nRetail therapy is shopping with the primary purpose of improving the buyer's mood or disposition. Often seen in people during periods of depression or stress, it is normally a short-lived habit. Items purchased during periods of retail therapy are sometimes referred to as \"comfort buys\" (compare comfort food).\n\nThe name \"retail therapy\" is ironic and semifacetious, acknowledging that shopping hardly qualifies as true therapy in the medical or psychotherapeutic sense. It was first used in the 1980s, with the first reference being this sentence in the \"Chicago Tribune\" of Christmas Eve 1986: \"We've become a nation measuring out our lives in shopping bags and nursing our psychic ills through retail therapy.\"\n\nThe fact that shopping may provide a short time of comfort (relief from dysphoria), but also imposes costs and is subject to comedown and withdrawal, make it, like opioid use, either a therapy or an addiction, depending on whether each person uses it adaptively or maladaptively. Retail therapy thus exists on a spectrum with shopping addiction (compulsive buying disorder). In 2001, the European Union conducted a study finding that 33% of shoppers surveyed had \"high level of addiction to rash or unnecessary consumption\". This habit was causing debt problems for many. The same study also found that young Scottish people had the highest susceptibility to binge purchasing. A 2013 survey of 1000 American adults found that slightly more than half had engaged in retail therapy, with the practice being more common among women (63.9% of women and 39.8% of men); women were most likely to buy clothing while men were most likely to buy food. Research from professors at Youngstown State University found similar results (64% of women vs. 40% of men), with relief from anxiety being the most common reason for retail therapy.\n\nResearchers at Melbourne University have advocated its classification as a psychological disorder called oniomania or compulsive shopping disorder.\n\nWindow shopping can offer some of the comforts of shopping. The advantage is that many items and many stores can be enjoyed without cost far more than spending would allow. The disadvantage is that one cannot acquire or keep the items. \n\n\n"}

In 1967, he became a Companion of the Order of Canada.\n\nLeonard Outerbridge was born in Asheville, North Carolina, on May 6, 1888, the son of Bermudians Sir Joseph Outerbridge and Maria Harvey Outerbridge (born Tucker), who were residents of Newfoundland. He was educated at Bishop Feild College in St. John's, Marlborough College in England, and finished a law degree at the University of Toronto where he was a Member of Alpha Delta Phi.\n\nOuterbridge served in the Canadian forces, during the Great War, reaching the rank of Colonel. After the war he worked as a lawyer in Toronto for a year before returning to St. John's to help his brother, Herbert, manage Harvey and Company Ltd.\n\nFrom 1923-24, Outerbridge was president of the Newfoundland Board of Trade, and in 1925 headed the Charity Organization Bureau. From 1930-1944, he was honorary private secretary to successive governors. For the last three years of the Second World War, Outerbridge volunteered full-time as director of Civil Defence, supervising the Air Raids Precaution Team. He was knighted in 1946 \"for services as Honorary Private Secretary to the Governor of Newfoundland\" as announced in the 1946 King's Birthday Honours.\n\nDuring the second referendum in 1948, Outerbridge was one of a group of Water Street merchants who supported confederation. In 1949, he succeeded Sir Albert Walsh, who was installed on a temporary basis, as the second lieutenant-governor of Newfoundland.\n\nOuterbridge, not Walsh, was Smallwood's initial choice for Newfoundland's first lieutenant-governor. As a confederation supporter, he was instrumental in gaining support from Newfoundland merchants. Upon the signing of the Terms of Union, Smallwood actually announced Outerbridge's appointment to the position but Canadian Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent and Outerbridge felt the declaration too hasty. Fearing the public would suspect patronage, Outerbridge was reluctant to take the position. It was decided Albert Walsh would become the first lieutenant-governor of the new Canadian province of Newfoundland, and Outerbridge succeeded him less than a year later. His term as lieutenant-governor lasted for eight years. He was made Knight of Grace of St. John of Jerusalem in 1951.\n\nAfter his term, Outerbridge became president of Harvey and Company Limited. In the 1970s he became chair of the company and still held the position at 90. Outerbridge was appointed a Companion of the Order of Canada in 1967. He received a special service award for his work as director of the Canadian National Institute for the Blind in 1983, and, in 1985, he was made a Companion of the Order of the Red Cross. He died in St. John's on September 6, 1986.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2011930", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2011930", "title": "Virtual crime", "text": "Virtual crime\n\nVirtual crime or in-game crime refers to a virtual criminal act that takes place in a massively multiplayer online game (MMOG), usually an MMORPG. The huge time and effort invested into such games can lead online \"crime\" to spill over into real world crime, and even blur the distinctions between the two. Some countries have introduced special police investigation units to cover such \"virtual crimes\". South Korea is one such country and looked into 22,000 cases in the first six months of 2003.\n\nSeveral interpretations of the term \"virtual crime\" exist. Some legal scholars opt for a definition based on a report written by freelance journalist Julian Dibbell on what was the first prominent case, \"a rape in cyberspace.\" One such scholar defined virtual crime as needing to have all the qualities of a real crime, and so was not a new subset of crime at all. Conversely, it has also been said that the connection between virtual crimes and real crimes are \"tenuous at best: It is the link between a brutal rape and a fictional story of a brutal rape. Surely the difference is more striking than any similarity.\" It is difficult to prove that there are real-life implications of virtual crime, so it is not widely accepted as prosecutable.\n\nTo rectify this, the modern interpretation of the term \"virtual\" must be amended such that it carries the traditional implication; \"that is such in essence or effect, though not recognised as such in name or according to strict definition.\" In this sense, it \"would include those crimes that somehow evoke and approach the effect and essence of real crime, but are not considered crimes.\"\n\nOver time, players build their characters and collect in-game items. Some such items may have been obtained through months of gameplay, involving various tasks and a substantial level of effort. According to standard conceptions of economic value, the goods and services of virtual economies do have a demonstrable value. Since players of these games are willing to substitute real economic resources of time and money (monthly fees) in exchange for these resources, by definition they have demonstrated utility to the user. \n\nStemming from their value in the virtual economy, these items, and the characters themselves, have gained monetary value in the real world. eBay, along with specialist trading sites, have allowed players to sell their wares. This has attracted fraudulent sales as well as theft. Many game developers, such as Blizzard Entertainment (responsible for \"World of Warcraft\") oppose and even prohibit the practice. Some argue that to allow in-game items to have monetary values makes these games, essentially, gambling venues.\n\nIn the online world of Brittania, the currency of one Annum equates to about $3.4 US. If someone were to steal another player's virtual currency, they could convert it to US dollars via PayPal. This stems controversy over whether or not this should be dealt with like real crime, as there are real-life implications.\n\nIn most games, players do not own, materially or intellectually, any part of the game world, and merely pay to use it. Because this \"virtual property\" is actually owned by the game developer, a developer who opposed real commerce of in-game currencies would have the right to destroy virtual goods as soon as they were listed on eBay or otherwise offered for real trade.\n\nIn South Korea, where the number of computer game players is massive, some have reported the emergence of gangs and mafia, where powerful players steal and demand that beginners give them virtual money for their \"protection\". \n\nIn China, Qiu Chengwei was sentenced to life in prison after stabbing and killing fellow \"The Legend of Mir 3\" gamer Zhu Caoyuan. In the game Qiu had lent Zhu a powerful sword (a \"dragon sabre\"), which Zhu then went on to sell on eBay for 7,200 Yuan (about £473 or US$870). With no Chinese laws covering the online dispute, there was nothing the police could do.\n\nIn the game \"The Sims Online\" a 17-year-old boy going by the in-game name \"Evangeline\", was discovered to have built a cyber-brothel, where customers would pay sim-money for minutes of cybersex. This led to the cancellation of his accounts but no legal action, mainly because he was above the age of consent.\n\nThe term \"virtual mugging\" was coined when some players of \"Lineage II\" used bots to defeat other player's characters and take their items. In Japan, the Kagawa prefectural police arrested a Chinese foreign exchange student on 16 August 2005 following the reports of virtual mugging and the online sale of the stolen items.\n\nThe virtual economies of many MMOs and the exchange of virtual items and currency for real money has triggered the birth of the game sweatshop, in which workers in the developing world, typically China (although there has been reports of this type of activity in Eastern European countries), earn real-world wages for long days spent monotonously performing in-game tasks. Most instances typically involve farming of resources or currency, which has given rise to the epithet \"Chinese Adena Farmer\", because of its first reported widespread use in \"Lineage II\". More egregious cases involve using exploits such as in duping money or items, such as a large-scale incident in \"Star Wars Galaxies\". Both practices can place great stress on the creators' artificial economy, requiring robust design, and often repeated updates, to preserve reasonable work/reward ratios and game balance. There have also been reports of collusion (or vertical integration, depending on the source) among farmers and online currency exchanges. In 2002, a company called Blacksnow Interactive, a game currency exchange, admitted to using workers in a \"virtual sweatshop\" in Tijuana, Mexico to farm money and items from \"Ultima Online\" and \"Dark Age of Camelot\". When Mythic Entertainment cracked down on the practice, Blacksnow attempted to sue the game company.\n\nIt was reported on 14 November 2007 that a Dutch teenager had been arrested for allegedly stealing virtual furniture from \"rooms\" in 3D social-networking website Habbo Hotel. The teenagers involved were accused of creating fake Habbo websites in order to lure users into entering their account details, which would then be used to steal virtual furniture bought with real money totalling €4000.\n\n\n\n"}

Her childhood was marked by the Napoleonic wars and by the death (1810) of her mother when Charlotte was just twelve years old.\n\nIn 1814 the Russian imperial family arranged her marriage – for political reasons – with Grand Duke Nicholas Pavlovich of Russia,\nwho later became Emperor Nicholas I. The couple married on 1 July 1817. Upon her marriage, Charlotte converted to Russian Orthodoxy, and took the Russian name \"Alexandra Feodorovna\". Ideally matched with her husband, she had a happy marriage that produced a large family; seven of her children survived childhood.\n\nFollowing the death of her brother-in-law, Emperor Alexander I of Russia, in December 1825, Alexandra's husband became the new Russian emperor. Alexandra enjoyed her husband's confidence in affairs of state, but she had no interest in politics other than her personal attachment to Prussia, her native country. She was the obedient and admiring supporter of her husband's views. Her personality was completely overshadowed by Nicholas I's strong character. As empress, Alexandra Feodorovna had no interest in charity work. Her chief interests were in family affairs, dancing, balls and jewels. After 1841 her health deteriorated. She spent long sojourns abroad in search of a respite to her illness. As she became largely an invalid, Nicholas I took mistresses, but Alexandra retained her husband's love. She survived Nicholas I by five years and died in 1860.\n\nEmpress Alexandra Feodorovna was born as Princess Friederike Luise Charlotte Wilhelmine of Prussia, at the Charlottenburg Palace in Berlin on .She was the eldest surviving daughter and fourth child of Frederick William III, King of Prussia, and Duchess Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, and a sister of Frederick William IV and of William I, German Emperor. She was known as Charlotte, a name popular in the Prussian royal family, and nicknamed Lottchen by her family.\n\nThe princess's childhood was marked by the Napoleonic Wars and she was raised under difficult financial conditions. Her father was a kind, religious man but a weak and indecisive ruler who, following military defeats in 1806, lost half of his kingdom. Charlotte's mother, admired for her beauty, intellect, and charm, was considered more decisive than her husband. When the Prussians were defeated at the battle of Jena, Louise fled to Königsberg, taking her children with her, Charlotte then being eight years old. In East Prussia, they were given protection by Tsar Alexander I. \"My daughter Charlotte is reserved and concentrated, but like her father, her seemingly cold appearance conceals the beating of her hot compassionate heart\", wrote Queen Louise about her daughter. On 27 October 1806, Berlin fell under Napoleon’s control and Charlotte grew up in war-torn Memel, Prussia. In December 1809, Queen Louise finally returned to Berlin with her children, but after a few months, became ill and died of typhus at the age of 34, shortly after Charlotte’s twelfth birthday. As the eldest daughter, Charlotte was now the most senior lady at the court and had to undertake her mother’s duties. For the rest of her life, Charlotte treasured her mother’s memory.\n\nIn February 1814, Grand Duke Nicholas Pavlovich, future Tsar of Russia, and his brother Grand Duke Michael Pavlovich, visited Berlin. Arrangements were made between the two dynasties for Nicholas to marry Charlotte, then fifteen years old, to strengthen the alliance between Russia and Prussia. Nicholas was only second in line to the throne, as the heir was his brother Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich who, like Tsar Alexander I, was childless. On a second visit the following year, Nicholas fell in love with the then-seventeen-year-old Princess Charlotte. Nicholas was tall and handsome with classical features. The feeling was mutual, \"I like him and am sure of being happy with him.\" She wrote to her brother, \"What we have in common is our inner life; let the world do as it pleases, in our hearts we have a world of our own.\" Hand-in-hand, they wandered over the Potsdam countryside, and attended the Berlin Court Opera. By the end of his visit, in October 1816, Nicholas and Charlotte were engaged. They were third cousins as great-great-grandchildren of Frederick William I of Prussia.\n\nOn 9 June 1817 Princess Charlotte came to Russia with her brother William. After arriving in St. Petersburg she converted to Russian Orthodoxy, and took the Russian name \"Alexandra Feodorovna\". On her nineteenth birthday, , she and Nicholas were married in the Grand Church of the Winter Palace. \"I felt myself very, very happy when our hands joined,\" she would later write about her wedding. \"With complete confidence and trust, I gave my life into the hands of my Nicholas, and he never once betrayed it.\"\n\nAt first, Alexandra Feodorovna had problems adapting to the Russian court, the change of religion affected her and she was overwhelmed by her new surroundings. She gained the favor of her mother-in-law, Maria Feodorovna, but did not get along well with the Empress Elizabeth Alexeievna, consort of her brother-in-law. \"I was very weak, very pale and (they claimed) very interesting-looking\", she recalled later.\n\nPregnant with her first child, Alexandra traveled to Moscow where, on , she gave birth to her first son, the future Tsar Alexander II. The next year, in Krasnoye Selo, she had a daughter, Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna. That summer, Tsar Alexander I announced privately to Nicholas and Alexandra his intention of eventually abdicating during his lifetime and that Nicholas would succeed him since their brother Constantine intended to marry morganatically. In 1820 Alexandra delivered a stillborn daughter, which brought on a deep depression. Her doctors advised a holiday, and in the autumn of 1820 Nicholas took her to see her family in Berlin, where they remained until the summer of 1821, returning again in the summer of 1824. They did not come back to St. Petersburg until March 1825 when Tsar Alexander I required their presence in Russia.\n\nAlexandra Feodorovna spent her first years in Russia trying to learn the language and customs of her adopted country under the tutelage of the poet Vasily Zhukovsky, whom she characterized as being \"too much of a poet to be a good tutor\". The Imperial family spoke German and wrote their letters in French, which was widely spoken at the Russian court, and as a consequence, Alexandra never completely mastered the Russian language.\n\nAlexandra Feodorovna wrote in her memoirs of her first years in Russia, \"We both were truly happy only when we found ourselves alone in our apartments, with me sitting on his knees while he was loving and tender\". Nicholas nicknamed his wife \"Mouffy\". For eight years, during the reign of Tsar Alexander I, the couple lived quietly. Tsar Alexander I had no surviving children and his heir, Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich, renounced his succession rights in 1822, making Nicholas heir to the throne.\n\nIn 1825 the Tsar gave Alexandra the Peterhof Palace, where she and Nicholas lived. It would remain her favorite summer residence.\n\nAlexandra was tall, thin, had a small head, and a pronounced brow. She had an air of regal majesty. Her quick, light walk was graceful. She was frail, often in poor health. Her voice was hoarse, but she spoke rapidly and with decision. \n\nAlexandra Feodorovna was an avid reader and enjoyed music. Her favorite Russian writer was Lermontov. She was kind and liked privacy and simplicity. She dressed elegantly, with a decided preference for light colors, and collected beautiful jewels. Alexandra loved dancing and was particularly skillful at the mazurka enjoying court balls until dawn. Neither arrogant nor frivolous, Alexandra was not without intelligence and had an excellent memory; her reading was quite extensive; her judgment of men sure, slightly ironical. However, she took no active interest in politics and fulfilled the role of being an empress consort, rather than being active in the public sphere. She loved her family very dearly, and even developed facial tics whilst fearing the Decembrist Uprising and its plans to kill her family. The facial tics were a trait that ran in the royal German-Russian-British family in many branches.\n\nAlexandra Feodorovna became Empress consort upon her husband's accession as Tsar Nicholas I in December 1825 during a turbulent period marked by the bloody repression of the Decembrist revolt. She and her husband were consecrated and crowned at the Assumption Cathedral in the Kremlin on 3 September 1826.\n\nBy 1832 Nicholas and Alexandra had seven children whom they raised with care. In 1837, when much of the Winter Palace was destroyed by fire, Nicholas reportedly told an aide-de-camp, \"Let everything else burn up, only just save for me the small case of letters in my study which my wife wrote to me when she was my betrothed.\"\n\nAfter more than twenty-five years of fidelity Nicholas took a mistress, Barbara Nelidova, one of Alexandra's ladies-in-waiting; the doctors had forbidden the Empress from sexual activity due to her poor health and recurring heart-attacks. Nicholas continued to seek refuge from the cares of state in Alexandra's company. \"Happiness, joy, and repose - that is what I seek and find in my old Mouffy.\" he once wrote.\n\nIn 1845, Nicholas wept when court doctors urged the Empress to visit Palermo for several months due to poor health. \"Leave me my wife\", he begged her physicians, and when he learned that she had no choice, he made plans to join her briefly. Nelidova went with them, and though Alexandra was jealous in the beginning, she soon came to accept the affair, and remained on good terms with her husband's mistress.\n\nAlexandra Feodorovna was always frail and in poor health. At forty, she looked far older than her years, becoming increasingly thin. For a long time, she suffered from a nervous twitching that became a convulsive shaking of her head.\n\nIn 1837 the Empress chose a resort in the Crimea for a new residence. There, Nicholas ordered that the Palace of Oreanda be built for her. She was only able to visit the palace once however; the Crimean War began in 1852. Towards the end of 1854, Alexandra Feodorovna fell ill, and came close to death, though she managed to recover. In 1855 Tsar Nicholas I contracted influenza, and he died on 6/18 February.\nAlexandra Feodorovna survived her husband by five years. She retired to the Alexander Palace in Tsarskoe Selo, and remained on good terms with her late husband's mistress Barbara Nelidova, whom she appointed as her personal reader.\n\nThe Dowager Empress's health became more and more fragile with the years. Unable to spend the harsh winters in Russia, she was forced to make long sojourns abroad in Switzerland, Nice and Rome. She wrote in September 1859 \"I am homesick for my country and I reproached myself for costing so much money at a time when Russia has need of every ruble. But I cough and my sick lungs cannot go without a southern climate\".\n\nAfter returning from a trip abroad in July 1860 she did not cease to be ill. In the autumn of 1860, her doctors told her that she would not live through the winter if she did not travel once more to the south. Knowing the danger, she preferred to stay in St. Petersburg so that she might die on Russian soil. The night before her death, she was heard to say, \"Niki, I am coming to you.\" She died in her sleep at the age of sixty-two on 1 November 1860 at the Alexander Palace in Tsarskoe Selo.\n\n"}

{"id": "2011952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2011952", "title": "Sculpture of the United States", "text": "Sculpture of the United States\n\nThe history of sculpture in the United States begins in the 1600s \"with the modest efforts of craftsmen who adorned gravestones, Bible boxes, and various utilitarian objects with simple low-relief decorations.\" American sculpture in its many forms, genres and guises has continuously contributed to the cultural landscape of world art into the 21st century.\n\nThere is frequently art in well-made tombstones, iron products, furniture, toys, and tools—perhaps better reflecting the character of a people than sculptures made in classical styles for social elites. One of these specific applications, the carving of wooden figureheads for ships, started in the Americas as early as 1750 and a century later helped launch the careers of Samuel McIntyre and the country's first famous sculptor, William Rush (1756–1833) of Philadelphia. The tradition begun then continues today in the folk sculpture style known as Chainsaw carving.\n\nIn the 1830s, the first generation of notable American sculptors studied and lived in Italy, particularly in Florence and Rome, creating the Neoclassic style. At that time, Italy \"\"provided the proper atmosphere, brought the sculptor close to the great monuments of antiquity, and provided museum collections that were available to study.\"\" They also gave the artists access to the carvers of Italy who translated their clay works into marble. During this period the themes from which the subjects of sculptural works were chosen tended to be drawn from antiquity, the exceptions being portraits (whose subjects were frequently shown wearing Roman or Greek garb) or works that included Native Americans. These artists included Horatio Greenough (1805–1852), Hiram Powers (1805–1873), Thomas Crawford (1814–1857), Thomas Ball (1819–1911) and his son-in-law William Couper (1853–1942), Harriet Hosmer (1830–1908), Chauncey Ives (1810–1894), Randolph Rogers (1825–1892) and (somewhat later) William Henry Rinehart (1825–1874).\n\nAmerican women also became active sculptors during the Italian Period despite the sexism of the age. Among the women who acquired both commissions and fame were Edmonia Lewis, Harriet Hosmer, Anne Whitney, Vinnie Ream and Emma Stebbins).\n\nIn the decades following the Civil War American sculptors began more and more to go to Paris to study — falling in with the more naturalistic and dramatic style exemplified by the works of Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux (1827–1875) and Antoine-Louis Barye (1796–1875) and other French sculptors. Among these Americans were Augustus Saint-Gaudens, Frederick MacMonnies, and Daniel Chester French. \n\nAmerican sculpture of the mid- to late 19th century was often classical and often romantic, but it showed a special bent for a dramatic, narrative, almost journalistic realism (especially appropriate for nationalistic themes) as witnessed by the frontier life depicted by Frederic Remington. This was the beginning of the style of \"Western Art\" that continued with Alexander Phimister Proctor and others through the 20th into the 21st century.\n\nThe naturalism of the French school, exemplified by Antoine Barye, had a great impact on the first sculptors of American wildlife. The first generation of American animaliers included, Edward Kemeys, Edward Potter (who occasionally worked with Daniel Chester French, producing horses for his equestrian statues), Alexander Phimister Proctor (who executed mounts for Augustus Saint-Gaudens' riders), Charles Russell, Herbert Haseltine, Albert Laessle and Anna Hyatt Huntington.\nThe years following the American Civil War saw a huge increase in the number of public monuments erected in the United States. \"By far the most prevalent monument features a fully equipped Confederate soldier (the same prototype held true for Union monuments) in a realistic pose.\"\nThis style of monument was popularized by sculptor Martin Milmore who created one of the first ones in 1868. Milmore's own monument, authored by Daniel Chester French, \"Death and the Sculptor\" remains one of America's \"noble tributes.\"\n\nAs the century closed, the pace of monument-building quickened in the great cities of the East, especially those erected to memorialize the Civil War. Several outstanding sculptors emerged, most of them trained in the beaux-arts academies of Paris. Daniel Chester French stands out, as do Frederick William Macmonnies, Hans Schuler, and Lorado Taft. This tradition continued to the 1940s with Charles Keck, Alexander Stirling Calder and others and the use of figurative sculpture in monuments persists into the 21st Century. After the middle of the 20th Century sculpture used in public monuments was increasingly abstract.\nThere are at least three major mountain sculptures in the United States. These are Mount Rushmore, Stone Mountain, and Crazy Horse Memorial. Gutzon Borglum, an accomplished sculptor with such pieces as \"Seated Lincoln\" and a variety of other public monuments, oversaw the sculpture of Mount Rushmore in the Black Hills in South Dakota. The monument was finished after his death by his son Lincoln Borglum.\n\nGutzon Borglum also was responsible for starting the Stone Mountain project in Georgia but had a falling-out with its overseers. The monument was then taken up by Augustus Lukeman, who died during its carving in 1935. The memorial was finished by Walker Hancock and was considered complete in 1972.\n\nThe Crazy Horse Memorial in the Black Hills of South Dakota depicts the Oglala Lakota warrior Crazy Horse riding a horse and pointing into the distance. It was begun in 1948 by sculptor Korczak Ziolkowski and continued after his death by his wife, Ruth Ziolkowski, who took over the helm of the project, and several of their children. The face was dedicated in 1998.\n\nPublic buildings of the last quarter of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century provided an architectural setting for sculpture, especially in relief. Karl Bitter, Lee Lawrie, Adolph Alexander Weinman, C. Paul Jennewein, Rene Paul Chambellan, Corrado Parducci, and many others worked in the simple, sometimes narrative style that fit these spaces. Much of this work was created by anonymous sculptors and carvers.\n\nAs the century began, many young European sculptors migrated to the free, booming economy across the Atlantic, and European trained sculptors account for much of the great work created before 1950. These include Elie Nadelman, Albin Polasek, Gaston Lachaise and Carl Milles.\n\nSeveral notable American sculptors joined in the revitalization of the classical tradition at this time, most notably Paul Manship, who \"discovered\" archaic Greek sculpture while studying on a scholarship in Rome. C. Paul Jennewein and Edward McCartan were also leaders in this direction who fit easily with the art-deco tastes of the 1920s.\nIn the 1930s and 1940s, the ideologies that rent European politics were reflected in associations of American sculptors. On the right was the group, mostly native-born, mostly old-school classical, mostly modelers of clay, who founded the National Sculpture Society, led by the heiress and sculptor Anna Hyatt Huntington and preserved in the sculpture park that she endowed — Brookgreen Gardens in South Carolina.\n\nOn the left, often immigrant, often expressionistic, was the New York-based Sculptors Guild, with an emphasis on more current themes and direct carving in wood or stone. Its most famous member was William Zorach.\n\nWith the Harlem Renaissance, an African-American sculpture genre emerged. Richmond Barthé was an outstanding example. Augusta Savage was a sculptor and teacher. Other contemporary sculptors include Elizabeth Catlett, Martin Puryear, Jerry Harris, Thaddeus Mosley, and Richard Hunt.\n\nSome Americans, such as Isamu Noguchi, had already moved from figurative to nonfigurative design, but after 1950, the entire American art world took a dramatic turn away from the former tradition, and America led the rest of the world into a more iconoclastic and theoretical approach to modernism.\n\nWithin the next ten years, traditional sculpture education would almost completely be replaced by a Bauhaus-influenced concern for abstract design. To accompany the triumph of abstract expressionist painting, heroes of abstract sculpture such as David Smith emerged, and many new materials were explored for sculptural expression. Louise Nevelson pioneered the emerging genre of environmental sculpture.\n\nHowever, during this period a group of American sculptors persisted in creating works in their pre-war, modern/classical-style. These include Milton Horn, Donal Hord, Charles Umlauf, Joseph Erhardy, and John Henry Waddell.\n\nThe figure returned in the 1960s, but without the beaux-arts figurative tradition, sometimes even as life-casts like those George Segal made with plaster. Jim Gary created life-sized figures composed of metal washers and hardware almost invisibly welded together, as well as those of stained glass and even used automobile parts and tools in his sculptures.\n\nConcerns for the qualities of forms and design continued — but usually without representing a human figure. Minimalist sculpture by artists such as Richard Serra and Norman Carlberg often replaced the figure in public settings. Sculpture of the late 20th century was mostly a playful exploration of the boundaries of what could be called art.\n\nThe Minimalist style reduces sculpture to its most essential and fundamental features. Minimalists include Tony Smith, Donald Judd, Robert Morris, Larry Bell, Anne Truitt, and Dan Flavin;\n\nSite specific and environmental art works are represented by artists: Donald Judd, Dennis Oppenheim, Richard Serra, Robert Irwin, George Rickey, and Christo and Jeanne-Claude led contemporary abstract sculpture in new directions. Artists created environmental sculpture on expansive sites in the 'land art in the American West' group of projects. These land art or 'earth art' environmental scale sculpture works exemplified by artists such as Robert Smithson, Michael Heizer, James Turrell (Roden Crater) and others\nThe land art (earth art) environmental scale sculpture works by Robert Smithson, Michael Heizer, James Turrell and others.\n\nArtists Bill Bollinger, Eva Hesse, Sol LeWitt, Jackie Winsor, Keith Sonnier, Bruce Nauman, and Lucas Samaras, among others were pioneers of Postminimalist sculpture.The later works of Robert Graham continued evolving, often in public art settings, into the 21st century.\n\nAlso during the 1960s and 1970s artists as diverse as Stephen Antonakis, Chryssa, Walter De Maria, Dan Flavin, Robert Smithson, Dennis Oppenheim, Robert Irwin, Claes Oldenburg, George Segal, Edward Kienholz, Duane Hanson, and John DeAndrea explored abstraction, imagery and figuration through Light sculpture, Land art, and installation art in new ways.\n\nOther kinds of sculpture grew in importance, some evolving from the work of leaders in ironwork during the early 1900s who included Samuel Yellin. A center for the western style of American sculpture developed at Loveland, Colorado, and many studios, magazines, and even a museum (the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City) pursued this interest. A neo-Victorian style emerged, pioneered by the sculptor Frederick Hart.\n\nThe art-doll and ceramic sculpture communities also grew in numbers and importance in the late 20th century, while the entertainment industry required large-scale, spectacular (sometimes monstrous or cartoon-like ) sculpture for movie sets, theme parks, casinos, and athletic stadiums. Industrial product design, especially automobiles, should not be ignored. An example is Randolph Parducci's (brother of Corrado Parducci) sculptures created for the famous chariot race scene in the film \"Ben Hur\".\n\nUnited States courts have consistently held that sculptors maintain an intellectual property right to sculptures and are entitled to compensation if photographs are used for commercial purposes. The rights apply even if the sculptor no longer owns the sculpture or the sculpture is not even in a public space. The sculptor, however, could sign away those rights. Some other countries, such as Germany, give permission to take the photographs via the concept of Panoramafreiheit, or Freedom of Panorama.\nOn February 25, 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled 2-1 that the Frank Gaylord, sculptor of the Korean War Veterans Memorial, was entitled to compensation because an image of it was used on a 37 cent U. S. postage stamp and he had not signed away his intellectual property rights. The appeals court rejected arguments that the photo was transformative.\n\nIn 2002, amateur photographer and retired Marine John All was paid $1,500 to use one of his photographs of the memorial on a snowy day for the stamp which sold more than $17 million worth of stamps. In 2006, sculptor Frank Gaylord enlisted Fish & Richardson to make a pro bono claim that the U. S. Postal Service had violated his intellectual property rights to the sculpture and thus he should have been compensated. The Postal Service argued that Gaylord was not the sole sculptor (saying he had received advice from federal sources – who recommended that the uniforms appear more in the wind) and also that the sculpture was actually architecture. Gaylord won all of his arguments in the lower court except for one…the court ruled the photo was fair use and thus he was not entitled to compensation. Gaylord appealed the fair use ruling and won the case on appeal. On April 22, 2011, The US Court of Claims awarded Gaylord $5,000.\n\n\n\n"}

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 17, 1998. Homer and Marge discover that the fear of getting caught while making love is a turn on and start making love in public places. This episode is rated TV-14 in the United States (TV-PG-DLS on FXX), and was at one point rated M in Australia. It was the first episode written by Matt Selman and was the only episode to be directed by Klay Hall. Some networks list the episode by the title, \"Margie, May I Sleep with Danger?\".\n\nMatt Groening listed the episode as being his eighth favorite episode, and the aroused cow is one of his all-time favorite act break jokes. Andy Dougan of the \"Evening Times\" characterized the episode along with \"Large Marge\", \"Three Gays of the Condo\", and \"The Way We Weren't\", as \"four of the funniest episodes of recent series\". The DVD release was also reviewed favorably by Louis R. Carlozo in the \"Chicago Tribune\", where the episode was seen as \"more ridiculous\" than \"Large Marge\".\n\nIt is Homer and Marge's eleventh wedding anniversary and Grampa does not arrive at the Simpson house to babysit the children, spoiling Homer and Marge's evening together. Later that evening, Homer and Marge attempt to have sexual intercourse, but lack enthusiasm. The following day, it is discovered that the refrigerator's motor has burned out so Homer and Marge make their way to a hardware store to buy another one.\n\nOn the way, the car gets stuck in the muddy driveway in the middle of farm country. Homer and Marge rush into the nearest barn to avoid a sudden storm. A farmer discovers the barn door is open and suspects trespassers. He enters the barn, nearly catching Homer and Marge, who are hiding in the hay loft, but leaves after failing to locate them. When the coast is clear, Homer and Marge have inspired sexual intercourse in the hay loft.\n\nHomer and Marge think their marriage has been recharged and go for a romantic weekend at a bed and breakfast, but soon fall into their old patterns. However, a maid walks in on them and they conclude they are both aroused when they risk being caught during intimate moments, so they have sex behind window curtains in a room full of people. Their love life is recharged and one day they begin to have sex on the same miniature golf course windmill where Bart was conceived.\n\nThis time they come \"too\" close to being caught having public sex, and while they manage to escape, they have to flee through Springfield naked. After trying to seek help from Gil at his car lot, they steal his hot air balloon and fly throughout the city in it. As Marge tries to pilot the balloon after Homer falls and is left hanging on the rope, the balloon lands in a football stadium, and a naked photograph of Homer and Marge appears in the local newspaper. The next day, Bart and Lisa see the picture and their parents begin to explain sex to them. Before they go into detail, however, they decide to go back to the miniature golf course.\n\nIn a subplot, Bart and Lisa stay at the Springfield Retirement Castle with Grandpa, and they discover a metal detector in his closet. While Bart uses it to look for pirate treasure, they uncover an alternate ending to \"Casablanca\". After playing the scene on a projector screen it turns out to be a very sanitized and typical Hollywood happy ending, where Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman's characters marry in the end. Bart, Lisa and Grandpa all like it but one of the spectators, the Old Jewish Man, reveals that he was once a studio executive and tried to include this happy ending to the film. Disgruntled, he pays Bart and Lisa to re-bury the film reel, giving them another film reel to bury along with it, titled \"It's A Wonderful Life (Killing Spree Ending).\"\n\n\"Natural Born Kissers\" was the first episode written by Matt Selman, who partly based it on his parents' marriage. The episode was the only time that show runner Mike Scully ever got a call from Fox where they suggested not doing the episode. They were worried about the sexual content, the nudity, and how it was going to be handled. They disliked several of the phrases used in the episode, such as the term \"ass forkin'\".\n\nIn an interview, Matt Groening said: \"The network censors couldn't believe it, and neither could I: the cow at the peephole while Homer and Marge make love in a hayloft; neighbors groping Homer when he and Marge are caught nude inside the windmill at the Sir Putts-A-Lot mini golf course; Homer dangling naked from a hot-air balloon, his ass dragging against the glass of a Crystal Cathedral-like church.\"\n\nThe producers fought the censors and in the end, very little of the script was modified. This episode is the first time that Marge's buttocks are shown on television. Marge and Homer in the golf course is a reference to the season three episode \"I Married Marge\", although in that episode they are in a castle, rather than a windmill.\n\nThe airplane restaurant \"Up, Up and Buffet!\" is based on a submarine shaped restaurant that was near the Fox studio named \"Dive!\". A supposed alternate ending to the 1942 film \"Casablanca\" is shown in the episode, and the Old Jewish Man gives Bart and Lisa a copy of \"It's A Wonderful Life\" with a \"killing-spree ending\". The song \"Spanish Flea\" plays during the radio commercial for Divorce Specialists. The song \"Rock the Casbah\" by The Clash plays over the end credits.\n\nIn its original broadcast, \"Natural Born Kissers\" finished 29th in ratings for the week of May 11–18, 1998, with a Nielsen rating of 8.8, equivalent to approximately 8.6 million viewing households. It was the fourth highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following \"The X-Files\", \"King of the Hill\", and \"Ally McBeal\".\n\nMatt Groening listed the episode as being his eighth favorite episode, and the aroused cow is one of his all-time favorite act break jokes. The authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote, \"a superb episode which actually makes Marge and Homer's love life seem very real; everyone needs a bit of spice now and again, and they find theirs. The balloon trip is hysterical, and the attempts to explain their behaviour to a very worldly-wise Bart and Lisa are magnificent.\"\n\nThe episode was part of a DVD boxed set release called \"The Simpsons Kiss and Tell: The Story of Their Love\", and in his review of the release, Andy Dougan of the \"Evening Times\" characterized the episode along with \"Large Marge\", \"Three Gays of the Condo\", and \"The Way We Weren't\", as \"four of the funniest episodes of recent series\".

{"id": "2011957", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2011957", "title": "Scutelleridae", "text": "Scutelleridae\n\nScutelleridae is a family of true bugs. They are commonly known as jewel bugs or metallic shield bugs due to their often brilliant coloration. They are also known as shield-backed bugs due to the enlargement of the thoracic scutellum into a continuous shield over the abdomen and wings. This latter characteristic distinguishes them from most other families within Heteroptera, and may lead to misidentification as a beetle rather than a bug. These insects feed on plant juices from a variety of different species, including some commercial crops. Closely related to stink bugs, they may also produce an offensive odour when disturbed. There are around 450 species worldwide.\n\nJewel bugs are small to medium-sized oval-shaped bugs with a body length averaging at . They can easily be distinguished from stink bugs (Pentatomidae) because the shield-like enlarged last section of their thorax (known as the scutellum, Latin for \"little shield\") completely covers the abdomen and the wings.\n\nDespite their resemblance to beetles, jewel bugs are hemipterans or true bugs. The scutellum is an extension of the thorax, unlike the elytra of beetles which are hardened forewings. As such, jewel bugs have four membranous wings underneath the scutellum in contrast to two in beetles. The scutellum in jewel bugs also does not have a division in the middle and thus does not 'split open' when they take flight like in beetles.\n\nThe heads of jewel bugs are triangular and the antennae have three to five segments. Like all heteropterans, jewel bugs are characterized by a segmented beak-like mouthpart (known as the rostrum). During feeding, jewel bugs inject proteolytic enzymes in their saliva into plants, digesting plant matter into a liquid form which they then suck up. The tarsus has three segments (tarsomeres).\n\nThough some species are quite drab, the most conspicuous jewel bugs are often brilliantly colored, exhibiting a wide range of iridescent metallic hues that change with the view angle. The colors are the result of a combination of factors. Some species like \"Chrysocoris stockerus\" and \"Scutellera nobilis\" display colors from multiple thin layers of pigmented chitin. The colors often change or become duller when the specimens are dried, due to the topmost chitinous layer becoming opaque and obscuring the colors of the bottom layer. The colors can be restored by moistening the surfaces with water.\n\nIridescence (or goniochromism) in jewel bugs like \"Poecilocoris lewisi\" are the result of structural coloration. Instead of pigments, the colors are caused by the interference, diffraction, or scattering of light by numerous tiny structures.\n\nIn \"Poecilocoris lewisi\", multiple tiny conical protuberances around 900 nm in height and averaging at a diameter of 360 nm are scattered on the epicuticle. These structures affect light passing through them, producing their oily-looking blue sheen (known as the Tyndall effect or Mie scattering).\n\nIn other species like the African shield bug (\"Calidea panaethiopica\"), the dorsal cuticle is dotted with tiny regularly spaced hemispherical cavities. The depressions act like Bragg mirrors. When light hits the pitted surface, it gives off multiple reflections resulting in the distinctive two tone yellow-blue iridescence.\n\nThe colors and patterns on jewel bugs can vary significantly between instars and even within adults of a species.\n\nJewel bugs are also known to mimic the colors, patterns, and shape of other organisms for defensive purposes. An example is the yellow-spotted black \"Steganocerus multipunctatus\" which exhibits Müllerian mimicry with the tortoise beetle \"Chiridopsis suffriani\".\n\nAll jewel bugs feed on plants (phytophagous). The eggs are laid in compact clusters. They may be round or barrel-shaped with a lid or a cap at the top (known as the operculum). They also contain a ring of small protuberances near the cap called micropylar processes. They permit the passage of sperm into the egg for fertilization and enable gaseous exchange from within the egg and the outside world for the embryos. The eggs are white or cream colored when freshly laid but can change color as the embryo matures. When hatching, the prolarva (the advanced embryo) exit the egg by opening the lid through peristaltic movements and with the help of a T-shaped internal structure in the egg (known as the egg burster).\n\nLike all hemipterans, jewel bugs undergo incomplete metamorphosis (hemimetaboly) and do not possess larval and pupal stages. Instead the adults develop from several stages (instars) of nymphs (usually five) through successive moltings (ecdysis). Nymphs resemble the adults except for size and the absence of wings. They can be of different coloration or patterns from adults.\n\nSome species are known to exhibit parental care of eggs and nymphs. Notable examples of which are \"Cantao parentum\", \"Pachycoris klugii\", \"Pachycoris stalii\", \"Pachycoris torridus\", and \"Tectocoris diophthalmus\".\n\nChemical secretions from dorsal abdominal or sternal exocrine glands are used to attract mates by certain species of jewel bugs. In certain genera (like \"Tectocoris\", \"Psacasta\", \"Odontoscelis\", and \"Irochrotus\"), males possess special unicellular glands in the abdomen known as the androconia (singular: androconium). They release sex pheromones when ruptured.\n\nFemales possess a spermatheca, an ectodermal gland which opens into the oviduct. These serve as storage for sperm deposited by males. It contains glands which can nourish the spermatozoa until they can be released to fertilize eggs.\n\nMale jewel bugs of the genus \"Hotea\" possess an unusually large, spiky, and heavily sclerotized genitalia. They are used in a mating practice known as traumatic insemination, a result of evolutionary sexual conflict. Male \"Hotea\" bugs tear through the female reproductive ducts to deposit sperm, inflicting substantial damage to the female in the process.\n\nLike stink bugs, a vast majority of jewel bugs, both adults and nymphs, are also capable of releasing pungent defensive chemicals from glands located on the sides of the thorax. Typical compounds exuded by jewel bugs include alcohols, aldehydes, and esters.\n\nNymphs and adults often exhibit clustering behavior, being found in large numbers close to each other. This behavior is thought to have an evolutionary advantage. The more individuals present in an area, the stronger the odor of the chemicals released when the bugs are threatened. If this fails, stink bugs will react to threat by flying away or dropping to the ground.\n\nScutellerids were first described by the English zoologist William Elford Leach in 1815. It belongs to the order Hemiptera (true bugs), under the suborder Heteroptera and infraorder Pentatomomorpha. They are classified under the superfamily Pentatomoidea. They were formerly classified as a subfamily of Pentatomidae by George Willis Kirkaldy in 1909. The earliest attempt to restore them to family status was in 1917 by Edward Payson Van Duzee. Most authorities today regard it as a valid family group.\nIn phylogenetic studies in 2008 by Grazia \"et al.\", Scutelleridae was shown to be consistently monophyletic, basal to Acanthosomatidae, and distal to Plataspididae and Parastrachiidae. Below is the morphological unweighted tree of the superfamily Pentatomoidea after Grazia \"et al.\" (2008).\n\nThe family is composed of about 81 genera and around 450 species worldwide. While the tribal and subfamilial classifications remain unclear, they are divided into eight subfamilies \"sensu lato\": Elvisurinae, Eurygastrinae, Hoteinae (sometimes classified under Pachycorinae), Odontoscelinae, Odontotarsinae, Pachycorinae, Scutellerinae, and Tectocorinae.\n\n\nThough most jewel bugs do little harm to crop plants, a few members of Scutelleridae are considered major agricultural pests. Together with some species of stink bugs, they are collectively known as sunn pests (also spelled as senn, , or shüne pests) or wheat bugs. The most economically important species of which are members of the genus \"Eurygaster\".\n\n\"Eurygaster integriceps\", in particular, is a very destructive pest of cereal crops in North Africa, the Balkans, and western and central Asia. Other scutellerids known under the name 'sunn pest' include members of the genus \"Odontotarsus\", among others. Methods of control for sunn pests have included biological pest control, using wasps of the family Scelionidae from the genera \"Trissolcus\" and \"Ooencyrtus\".\n\nThe cotton harlequin bug (\"Tectocoris diophthalmus\") is also an important pest of cotton crops and \"Hibiscus\".\n\nBiological methods of pest control have sometimes backfired. A parasitoid fly which preys on hemipterans, \"Trichopoda pennipes\" was introduced to Hawaii to control the invasive species \"Nezara viridula\", the southern green stink bug. The fly now threatens native species of bugs in Hawaii as well, particularly the Koa bug (\"Coleotichus blackburniae\", a jewel bug species notable for not possessing stink glands) which has now become rare.\n\n\n"}

It is equipped with either a carburetor or electronic fuel injection and was also offered as the G10T with an IHI RHB31/32 turbocharger and either MPFI or a carburetor. It has a single overhead camshaft driving six valves. Cylinder spacing is , as for the four-cylinder G13/G15/G16 engines.\n\nA bore and stroke give the engine a total of of displacement. It produces at 5100 rpm and at 3200 rpm with 9.5:1 compression in the carbureted model, at 5700 rpm and at 3300 rpm in the fuel-injected model. The original home market version originally offered a carbureted JIS at 5500 rpm, later power output fluctuated around .\n\nFrom 1984 to 1988 the standard G10 engine used a hemispherical head carbureted design with mechanical lifters. From 1989 to 2001 the engine received updates in the form of throttle-body fuel injection and hydraulic lifters. A detuned unit, with a slightly different camshaft, two-ring pistons and differently tuned engine control unit, was used in the ultra-fuel-efficient Geo Metro XFi model, which delivered as much as . In the US, the G10 in the 2000 Chevrolet Metro became the last engine available on an American-sold vehicle to use throttle body injection for fuel delivery.\n\nThrough the 1985-1991 model years a turbocharged MPFI version of the G10 was offered in some markets. This engine delivered at 5500 rpm and at 3500 rpm. This turbocharged engine, with mechanical lifters, was available in both the US and Canadian Firefly/Sprint/Forsa from 1987-88. Only the Canadian Firefly/Sprint had this option, with hydraulic lifters, in the 1989-1991 model years. In the Japanese domestic market, the car was originally carbureted ( JIS at 5500 rpm, at 3500 rpm) and went on sale in June 1984. In October 1987, along with a facelift, the home market Turbo received fuel injection and power output went up to JIS, torque to . It was a short-lived version, however, as by September 1988 the car was no longer on sale in the Japanese domestic market. As the only market in the world, Canada did continue to receive this engine for its versions of the second generation Cultus.\n\nBecause of the physics of the straight-three engine, the G10 tends not to idle as smoothly as other engines such as a straight-six engine.

In numerous cases Willam decided the accused was innocent. In one of his most consequential cases, William refused to condemn a man on charges of heresy, despite the demands of the inquisitor Bernardo Gui. The accusations of heresy stemmed from the man's translation of a Greek book that contradicted the scriptures. Despite his appeals to the Pope, William was imprisoned and tortured until he recanted, in turn leading to the translator's death by burning at the stake. Though he departed from his role as an inquisitor, his torture and the death of the accused remain fresh in his mind.\n\nIn 1327, William and Adso travel to a Benedictine monastery in Northern Italy to attend a theological disputation between the Franciscans and Papal emissaries on the poverty of Christ. This abbey is being used as an embassy between Pope John XXII, and the Friars Minor, who are suspected of heresy.\n\nThe abbey boasts a famed scriptorium where scribes copy, translate or illuminate books. After a string of unexpected deaths the abbot seeks help from William, who is renowned for his deductive powers, to investigate the deaths. William is reluctantly drawn in by the intellectual challenge and his desire to disprove fears of a demonic culprit. William also worries the abbot will summon officials of the Inquisition should the mystery remain unsolved.\n\nFollowing the events of \"The Name of the Rose\", Adso and William part ways, with Adso relating the tale before his death. We are informed near the end of the book that William had died earlier during a Plague in Europe.\n\nThe fictional friar, William of Baskerville, alludes both to the fictional sleuth Sherlock Holmes and to William of Ockham. The name itself is derived from William of Ockham and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's book \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\". Another view is that Eco has created Brother William as a combination of Roger Bacon, William of Ockham and Sherlock Holmes. (William himself notes that Bacon was a mentor of his and cites his ideas several times in the course of the book.)\n\nWilliam of Ockham, who lived during the time of the novel, first put forward the principle known as \"Ockham's Razor\", which is often summarised as the dictum that one should always accept as most likely the simplest explanation that accounts for all the facts. William applies this dictum in a manner analogous to the way Sherlock Holmes applies his similar dictum, that when one has eliminated the impossible, whatever remains — however improbable — must be the truth.\n\nIn the book, \"The Name of the Rose\", Umberto Eco's description of Brother William of Baskerville has some similarities to Arthur Conan Doyle's description of Sherlock Holmes in \"A Study in Scarlet\" (1887).\n\nHowever, William has blond eyebrows and yellowish hair clumps growing from his ears.\n\nWilliam of Baskerville's behavioral characteristics, as relayed through William's novice, Adso of Melk, also displays similarities to Sherlock Holmes' as characterized by Dr. Watson.\n\nSherlock Holmes' use of cocaine is also similar to Brother William's use of a mysterious herb. The book explains that Brother William used to collect some herb that has a mentally stimulating effect, but it does not seem narcotic. \"He sometimes stopped at the edge of a meadow, at the entrance to a forest, to gather some herb [...] and he would then chew it with an absorbed look. He kept some of it with him, and ate it in the moments of great tension\".\n\nSean Connery portrayed William of Baskerville in the 1986 film adaptation \"The Name of the Rose\". John Turturro portrayed William of Baskerville in the 2019 miniseries \"The Name of the Rose\".\n\n"}

It airs an adult hits radio format and is owned by iHeartMedia. Its slogan is \"We Play Everything.\" KDRB is the flagship station for Iowa State University sports.\n\nThe station's studios are located at 2141 Grand Avenue in Des Moines along with iHeartMedia's other Des Moines stations, and its transmitter is located on Northwest 2nd Street, near Ankeny Boulevard in Alleman. KDRB broadcasts in the HD Radio format. Its HD-2 subchannel airs a simulcast of sister station WHO.\n\nIn 1948, the station signed on as WHO-FM. It was owned by the Central Broadcasting Company and was the third FM station in Des Moines, after KRNT-FM and KSO-FM. In its early years, it primarily simulcast its sister station, AM 1040 WHO. During the \"Golden Age of Radio,\" WHO-AM-FM carried programming from the NBC Red Network, including comedies, dramas, news, sports, soap operas, game shows and big band broadcasts.\n\nStudios were located at 1100 Walnut Street and the station's tower and transmitter were located on top of the Equitable Building at 6th and Locust in Des Moines. In 1950, the transmitter was moved to a new tower at WHO's transmitter site in Mitchellville, Iowa. The old transmitter and tower on top of the Equitable Building were sold to KCBC for a new FM station KCBC-FM. In the mid-1960s, WHO-FM ceased simulcasting its AM sister and started programming easy listening and classical music.\n\nIn 1973, the station underwent some dramatic changes. The call letters were changed to KLYF and the station was reprogrammed with a beautiful music format in FM stereo. This was the first time that the station broadcast in multiplex stereo and became known by its nickname \"K-Life.\" As the 1980s approached, KLYF added more vocals to its sound to attract younger listeners. In 1981, the format evolved into a soft adult contemporary format.\n\nBy the mid 1990s, KLYF was a Hot AC station competing directly with KSTZ. The station's transmitter was eventually moved to the WOI Tower near Alleman, Iowa.\n\nIn December 1996, Palmer Broadcasting sold its Des Moines radio stations to Jacor Broadcasting of Cincinnati, Ohio. Jacor immediately re-branded KLYF as \"Mix 100.3,\" but left the format unchanged for the most part. On June 17, 1998, the call letters changed to KMXD to represent Mix and Des Moines. Over time the station saw its ratings decline.\n\nSeveral steps were taken to try to counteract this, such as rebranding the station as \"Mix 100\" and trying an \"80s and more\" format. When these steps failed, the format was changed again to mainstream adult contemporary and the station was renamed \"My 100.\" In 1999, Clear Channel Communications (the forerunner to current owner iHeartMedia) bought Jacor, bringing KLYF under its ownership.\n\nOn May 25, 2006, the AC format came to an end, as KMXD was rebranded as \"The Bus,\" simulcasting the adult hits format on 106.3, which at the time carried the KDRB call sign. This was a short lived, transitional arrangement to get listeners of 106.3 to move to 100.3. The adult hits format had performed better than expected, and the decision was made to move \"The Bus\" to the 100,000 watt signal at 100.3.\n\nOn June 12, 2006, KMXD became KDRB \"The Bus\" on 100.3 FM. The 106.3 frequency switched to AAA as KPTL, \"Capital 106.3\".\n\n100.3 The Bus primarily has no DJs, except Heather Burnside in middays and Maxwell in afternoon drive. However, most of the time, the \"Bus Driver\" is heard between most songs and commercial breaks, mainly to identify the station. The voice of the \"Bus Driver\" is national voiceover artist Mark Driscoll.\n\nKDRB has been the flagship station for the Iowa State University Cyclones sports teams since the 2006-2007 season, taking over from sister station AM 1460 KXNO. Its longtime AM sister, WHO, airs the games of the rival University of Iowa.\n\nKDRB has an effective radiated power of 100,000 watts, the maximum output for non-grandfathered FM stations. It broadcasts from a height above average terrain (HAAT) of 547 meters (1795 feet). That gives it one of the best FM signals in Iowa, allowing it to be heard over much of the state. With a good radio, it can sometimes be heard in small sections of Kansas, Illinois and Nebraska. Co-owned AM 1040 WHO also has the largest coverage area of any AM station in the state of Iowa.\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1885, it was the first modern nationalist movement to emerge in the British Empire in Asia and Africa. From the late 19th century, and especially after 1920, under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, Congress became the principal leader of the Indian independence movement. Congress led India to independence from Great Britain, and powerfully influenced other anti-colonial nationalist movements in the British Empire.\n\nCongress is a secular party whose social democratic platform is generally considered to be on the centre-left of Indian politics. Congress' social policy is based upon the Gandhian principle of Sarvodaya—the lifting up of all sections of society—which involves the improvement of the lives of economically underprivileged and socially marginalised people. The party primarily endorses social democracy—seeking to balance individual liberty and social justice, welfare and secularism. Its constitution states democratic socialism to be its ideal.\n\nAfter the party's foundation in 1885, Womesh Chunder Bonnerjee\nbecame its first president.  A total of sixty one people have served as the president of the Indian National Congress. Sonia Gandhi is the longest serving president of the Congress party, having held the office for nineteen years from 1998 to 2017.\n\nDuring 1885–1933, the presidency had a term of 1 year only. Traditionally, the post rotated between prominent members of the party, successive terms for the same person being frowned upon. During Jawaharlal Nehru's premiership, he rarely held the Presidency of INC, even though he was always head of the Legislative Party.\n\nIndira Gandhi however, institutionalized the practice of having the same person as the Congress President and the Prime Minister of India after she formed Congress (I) in 1978. Her son Rajiv Gandhi continued that practice.\n\nP. V. Narasimha Rao too held both the Congress (I) President and the Prime Minister's posts. Sitaram Kesri held the post after INC was voted out. But as the party never returned to power under his leadership, he didn't hold the two posts together.\n\nDuring 2000–09, INC did not host a conference for the first time in history. In 2004, when the INC was voted back into power, Manmohan Singh became the first Prime Minister, not to be the president of the party since Indira Gandhi established the practice of the president holding both positions. Sonia Gandhi is the longest serving president of the Congress party, having held the office for nineteen years from 1998 to 2017. Her son Rahul Gandhi, the last Congress President, resigned from the post on 3 July 2019. On 10 August, the Congress Working committee, elected Sonia Gandhi as the interim President. The decision led to critics saying that the Gandhi family is refusing to loosen its grip on the party’s internal power structures.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2012056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2012056", "title": "Rome, Open City", "text": "Rome, Open City\n\nOpen City or Rome, Open City () is a 1945 Italian neorealist drama film directed by Roberto Rossellini. The picture features Aldo Fabrizi, Anna Magnani and Marcello Pagliero, and is set in Rome during the Nazi occupation in 1944. The title refers to Rome being declared an open city after 14 August 1943. The film won several awards at various film festivals, including the most prestigious Cannes Grand Prix and was nominated for the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar at the 19th Academy Awards.\n\nIn occupied Rome in 1944, German SS troops are trying to arrest the engineer Giorgio Manfredi, a communist and a leader of the Resistance against the German Nazis and Italian Fascists, who is staying in a rooming house. The landlady warns him in time of the Germans' arrival, so that he can elude them by jumping across the rooftops. He goes to the home of Francesco, another Resistance fighter. There he encounters Pina who lives in the next apartment. Pina, Francesco's fiancée, is visibly pregnant. She first suspects Giorgio of being a cop and gives him a rough time, but when he makes it clear he is not, she welcomes him into Francesco's apartment to wait for him. With Pina's help (she is also part of the Resistance), Giorgio contacts Don Pietro Pellegrini, a Catholic priest who is helping the Resistance, and asks him to transfer messages and money to a group of Resistance fighters outside the city as Giorgio is now known to the Gestapo and cannot do it himself.\n\nDon Pietro is scheduled to officiate at Pina's and Francesco's wedding the next day. Francesco is not very religious, but rather would be married by a patriot priest than a fascist official; Pina, on the other hand, is devout, but wrestling with why God would allow such terrible things to happen to people. Her son, Marcello, is a somewhat reluctant altar boy. He and his friends have a small role in the Resistance planting bombs. Pina's sister Laura stays with her, but is not involved in the Resistance; in fact, she works in a cabaret serving the Nazis and Fascists. She is also an old friend of Marina, a girlfriend of Giorgio who has been looking for him, but with whom he is splitting up. Marina also works in the cabaret and as an occasional prostitute.\nThe local SS commander in the city, helped by the Italian police commissioner, suspects that Giorgio is at Francesco's apartment. They conduct a huge raid, pulling out all the people and arresting dozens of men. Giorgio gets away, but Francesco is thrown in a truck with other arrestees. Seeing him being taken away, Pina breaks through a cordon of police and runs towards him, but is shot dead. The priest, who was in the building to hide weapons, under the guise of praying for a dying man, holds her in his arms and prays for her soul. The truck drives away in a convoy with military vehicles, but outside of town it is attacked by Resistance fighters, and many of the captives escape. Francesco makes it back into Rome and reconnects with Giorgio. Together they go to the priest, who has offered to hide them in a monastery.\n\nMarina betrays her former lover in exchange for drugs and a fur coat. Using information given by Marina, the Gestapo and Italian police capture Giorgio and the priest, along with an Austrian defector, on their way to the monastery. Francesco is saying goodbye to Marcello, and sees them get picked up and gets away. The defector, fearing torture, hangs himself in his cell. The Gestapo try to get Giorgio to betray his comrades, but it is in vain. He does not respond to sweet talk, so they torture him intensely; they want to break him before word gets out that he was arrested, so they can take the Resistance by surprise with the information they hope to extract from Giorgio.\n\nThey also try to use Don Pietro's influence on Giorgio to convince him to betray his cause, saying that he is an atheist and communist who is the enemy, but Don Pietro responds that anyone who strives to live a righteous life is on the path of God whether they believe in Him or not. They then force Don Pietro to watch Giorgio's torture. When Giorgio dies without revealing anything, Don Pietro blesses his body and commends him to God's mercy (last rites and sacraments cannot be given to someone who has died). Giorgio's refusal to yield shakes the confidence of the Germans, including the commander, who had boasted to the priest and the collaborating woman that they were the \"master race\", and no one from a \"slave race\" could withstand their torture.\n\nMarina and a German officer stumble into the scene while intoxicated; she faints when she sees that the Germans have tortured Giorgio to death rather than treat him well as she had been led to expect. Realizing that she was responsible for this, she passes out. The Gestapo chief and the collaborator decide that she is now useless to them and arrest her, taking away the fur coat they had given her as a bribe.\n\nDon Pietro still refuses to crack, so he is taken to be executed early the next morning before his parish can learn of his arrest and respond with a protest. However, the parish altar boys/Resistance fighters show up to where Don Pietro is being executed, and they begin whistling a tune which Don Pietro recognizes. The Italian firing squad is lined up to execute Don Pietro, but some deliberately miss him. The German officer in charge of the execution squad walks over to Don Pietro as soon as he realizes that the Italians will not kill a priest, and executes Don Pietro himself.\n\nAt this, the altar boys and Resistance fighters grow silent, bow their heads in grief, and slowly walk away. As the kids make way back into the city, a final shot of the city of Rome and St. Peter's Basilica can be seen clearly in the background.\n\nBy the end of World War II, Rossellini had abandoned the film \"Desiderio\" because conditions made it impossible to complete (it later was finished by Marcello Pagliero in 1946 and disowned by Rossellini). By 1944, there was virtually no film industry in Italy and no money to fund films. Rossellini had met and befriended a wealthy, elderly lady in Rome who wanted to finance a documentary on Don Pieto Morosini, a Catholic priest who had been shot by the Germans for helping the partisan movement in Italy. Rossellini wanted actor Aldo Fabrizi to play the priest in reenactments and contacted his friend Federico Fellini to help get in touch with Fabrizi.\n\nBy then, the lady had agreed to finance an additional documentary about Roman children who had fought against the German occupiers. Fellini and screenwriter Sergio Amidei suggested to Rossellini that, instead of two short documentaries, he should make one feature film that combined the two ideas, and in August 1944, just two months after the Allies had forced the Nazis to evacuate Rome, Rossellini, Fellini, and Amidei began working on the script for the film.\n\nThe devastation that was the result of the war surrounded them as they wrote the script. They titled it \"Roma, città aperta\" and declared publicly that it would be a history of the Roman people under Nazi occupation. Shooting for the film began in January 1945. The funding from the elderly Roman lady was never enough, and the film was crudely shot due to circumstances and not for stylistic reasons. The facilities at Cinecittà Studios were also unusable at that time due to unreliable electricity supply and poor quality film stock.\n\nNew Yorker Rod E. Geiger, a soldier in the Signal Corps, who eventually became instrumental in the movie's global success, met Rosselini at a point when they were out of film. Geiger had access to the film units at the Signal Corps that regularly threw away short-ends and complete rolls of film that might be fogged, scratched, or otherwise deemed unfit for use, and was able to obtain and deliver enough discarded stock to complete the picture.\n\nIn order to authentically portray the hardships and poverty of Roman people under the occupation, Rossellini hired mostly non-professional actors for the film, with a few exceptions of established stars including Fabrizi and Anna Magnani. On the making of the film, Rossellini stated that the \"situation of the moment guided by my own and the actors' moods and perspectives\" dictated what they shot, and he relied more on improvisation than on a script. He also stated that the film was \"a film about fear, the fear felt by all of us but by me in particular. I too had to go into hiding. I too was on the run. I had friends who were captured and killed.\" Rossellini relied on traditional devices of melodrama, such as identification of the film's central characters and a clear distinction between good and evil characters. Four interior sets were constructed for the more important locations of the film.\n\nIt was believed that the actual film stock was put together out of many different disparate bits, giving the film its documentary or newsreel style. But, when the Cineteca Nazionale restored the print in 1995, \"the original negative consisted of just three different types of film: Ferrania C6 for all the outdoor scenes and the more sensitive Agfa Super Pan and Agfa Ultra Rapid for the interiors.\" The previously unexplained changes in image brightness and consistency are now blamed on poor processing (variable development times, insufficient agitation in the developing bath and insufficient fixing).\n\nIt was one of the early Italian films of the war to depict the struggle against the Germans, unlike the films made in the early years of the war (when Italy was Germany's ally under Mussolini) that depicted the British, Americans, Greeks, Russians and other allied countries, as well as Ethiopians, communists, and partisans as the antagonists. After the Allied Invasion of Italy in 1943, Italian morale crumbled, and they agreed to a separate peace with the allies, causing their former German allies to occupy large parts of Italy, intern Italian soldiers, deport Italian Jews to concentration camps, and treat many of its citizens with disdain for what they saw as a cowardly betrayal by one of their major allies.\n\n\"Rome, Open City\" received a mediocre reception from Italian audiences when it was first released when Italian people were said to want escapism after the war. However, it became more popular as the film's reputation grew in other countries. The film brought international attention to Italian cinema and is considered a quintessential example of neorealism in film, so much so that together with \"Paisà\" and \"Germania anno zero\" it is called Rossellini's \"Neorealist Trilogy\". Robert Burgoyne called it \"the perfect exemplar of this mode of cinematic creation [neorealism] whose established critical definition was given by André Bazin\". Rossellini himself traced what was called neorealism back to one of his earlier films \"The White Ship\", which he claimed had the same style. Some Italian critics also maintained that neorealism was simply a continuation of earlier Italian films from the 1930s, such as those directed by filmmakers Francesco De Robertis and Alessandro Blasetti. More recent scholarship points out that this film is actually less neo-realist and rather melodramatic. Critics debate whether the pending marriage of the Catholic Pina and the communist Francesco really \"acknowledges the working partnership of communists and Catholics in the actual historical resistance\".\n\nBosley Crowther, film critic for \"The New York Times,\" gave the film a highly positive review, and wrote \"Yet the total effect of the picture is a sense of real experience, achieved as much by the performance as by the writing and direction. The outstanding performance is that of Aldo Fabrizi as the priest, who embraces with dignity and humanity a most demanding part. Marcello Pagliero is excellent too, as the resistance leader, and Anna Magnani brings humility and sincerity to the role of the woman who is killed. The remaining cast is unqualifiedly fine, with the exception of Harry Feist in the role of the German commander. His elegant arrogance is a bit too vicious – but that may be easily understood.\" Film critic William Wolf especially praised the scene where Pina is shot, stating that \"few scenes in cinema have the force of that in which Magnani, arms outstretched, races towards the camera to her death.\"\n\nPope Francis has said that the film is among his favorites.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 100% based on 42 reviews, with an average rating of 9.08/10. The site's critics' consensus reads: \"\"Open City\" fills in the familiar contours of its storyline with three-dimensional characters and a narrative depth that add up to a towering – and still powerfully resonant – cinematic achievement.\"\n\nThe film opened in Italy on 27 September 1945, with the war damage to Rome not yet repaired. The United States premiere followed on 25 February 1946 in New York. The American release was censored, resulting in a cut of about 15 minutes. The story of the film's journey from Italy to the United States is recounted in Federico Fellini's autobiographical essay \"Sweet Beginnings\". Rod E. Geiger, a U.S. Army private stationed in Rome, met Rossellini and Fellini after catching them tapping into the power supply used to illuminate the G.I. dancehall. In the book \"The Adventures of Roberto Rossellini\", author Tag Gallagher credits Geiger at age 29 as the \"man who more than any single individual was to make him and the new Italian cinema famous around the world\". Before the war, Geiger had worked for an American distributor and exhibitor of foreign films which helped facilitate the film's release in the United States. In gratitude, Rossellini gave Geiger a co-producer credit.\n\nHowever, According to Fellini's essay Geiger was \"a 'half-drunk' soldier who stumbled (literally as well as figuratively) onto the set of \"Open City\". [He] misrepresented himself as an American producer when actually he 'was a nobody and didn't have a dime.'\" Fellini's account of Geiger's involvement in the film was the subject of an unsuccessful defamation lawsuit brought by Geiger against Fellini.\n\nThe film was banned in several countries. West Germany banned it from 1951 to 1960. In Argentina, it was inexplicably withdrawn in 1947 following an anonymous government order.\n\nWins\n\n\n\n"}

The music was composed by lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Patrick Stump, with all lyrics penned by bassist Pete Wentz, continuing the band's songwriting approach they took for some songs on their prior 2003 effort \"Take This to Your Grave\". Neal Avron handled production duties. Commenting on the record's lyrical themes, Wentz said the lyrics were about \"the anxiety and depression that goes along with looking at your own life.\" In support of their release the group headlined tours worldwide and played at various music festivals. For their Black Clouds and Underdogs tour the album was re-released as \"From Under the Cork Tree (Limited \"Black Clouds and Underdogs\" Edition)\", featuring new songs and remixes.\n\nThe album was Fall Out Boy's breakthrough mainstream success. Spearheaded by the lead single \"Sugar, We're Goin' Down\", the album debuted at No. 9 on the US \"Billboard\" 200 with 168,000 first week sales, a position it stayed at for two non-consecutive weeks, earning the band their first top 10 album and becoming their longest charting and best-selling album. It logged 14 weeks in the top 20 out of its 78 chart weeks. The album as well as its singles won several awards and achieved Triple Platinum status. It has sold over 3.5 million albums in the United States as of 2007, and over 4 million worldwide. As of February 2013 \"Cork Tree\" has 3.7 million US sales. The album produced two hugely popular hit singles, \"Sugar, We're Goin' Down\" and \"Dance, Dance\" peaking at No. 8 and No. 9 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 respectively and receiving regular radio play at both Pop and Alternative stations. In 2005 the album was ranked 18th on the \"Top 100 best-selling albums of the year in the US\" with 2,654,320 sales and at No. 43 on IFPI's list of the \"Top 50 Best Selling Albums of 2005\" worldwide. Internationally it impacted in the UK and Canada.\n\nFall Out Boy formed near Chicago, Illinois, in 2001. The band debuted with a self-released demo in the same year, and in 2002 released a split EP with Project Rocket through Uprising Records. A first mini-album, \"Fall Out Boy's Evening Out with Your Girlfriend\" was recorded in 2002 but released in 2003 by Uprising against the band's wishes. Both releases helped Fall Out Boy gain notoriety on the internet and attention from record labels. The band signed with indie label Fueled by Ramen and received an advance from major label Island Records, which financed the production of \"Take This to Your Grave\". \"Grave\" became an underground success and helped the band gain a dedicated fanbase. Fall Out Boy returned to the studio in November 2004 to begin work on a new album.\n\nHowever, the group suffered a setback in February 2005 after Wentz's anxieties about creating a new record culminated in a suicide attempt. Wentz explained, \"It was overwhelming. I was either totally anxious or totally depressed. It is particularly overwhelming when you are on the cusp of doing something very big and thinking that it will be a big flop. I was racked with self-doubt.\" After undergoing therapy, Wentz rejoined the band and headed to Burbank, California to record the album.\n\n\"From Under the Cork Tree\" was recorded in Burbank, California, and served as the first time the band had stayed in California for an extended period of time. The group lived in corporate housing during the making of the album. In contrast to \"Take This to Your Grave\"'s rushed recording schedule, Fall Out Boy took a much more gradual pace while working on \"From Under the Cork Tree\". It was the first Fall Out Boy record in which Stump created all the music and Wentz wrote all the lyrics, continuing the approach they took for some songs on \"Grave\". Stump felt that this process was much more \"smooth\" as every member was able to focus on their individual strengths. He explained: \"We haven't had any of those moments when I play the music and he'll say, 'I don't like that,' and he'll read me lyrics and I'll say, 'I don't like those lyrics.' It's very natural and fun.\" Despite this, the band had great difficulty creating its desired sound for the album, constantly scrapping new material. Two weeks before recording sessions began, the group abandoned ten songs and wrote eight more, including the album's first single, \"Sugar, We're Goin' Down\".\n\nThe chorus of \"Sugar, We're Goin' Down\" was nearly thrown away by the group's label, but it was ultimately salvaged. Wentz recalled, \"Our label told us the chorus was too wordy and the guitars were too heavy and that the radio wasn’t going to play it.\" Island Records also intervened when the band wanted to title the album's first track \"My Name Is David Ruffin And These Are The Temptations\". Wentz stated \"Our label said, 'You're going to get sued for doing that,' and our lawyer said, 'You're definitely going to get sued for doing that,' which totally sucked. So we said, 'OK, why don't we immortalize you in a song?'\" The group subsequently retitled the song \"Our Lawyer Made Us Change the Name of This Song So We Wouldn't Get Sued\".\n\nStump served as the primary composer for \"From Under the Cork Tree\". He said of the album's musical style: \"We experimented quite a bit with all sorts of stuff. Some metal, some folk, some R&B. But ultimately, your band sounds like your band. You can put those things in it, but it's still going to sound like you.\" Niyaz Pirani of \"The Orange County Register\" referred to \"Dance, Dance\" as \"pop-punk-meets-swing-dance glory\".\n\nOn earlier works, Stump collaborated with Wentz on the lyrics. For \"From Under the Cork Tree\" and albums thereafter, Wentz handled all the lyrical duties. He called them \"more introspective\" than the group's previous album. \"\"Take This To Your Grave\" was very reactionary,\" says Wentz. \"It was like this person does this to you. But part of growing up is understanding that if you end up in the same situation over and over again you probably have to examine your own self and wonder whether that's one of the reasons that you have ended up in the same situation repeatedly. This time the lyrics were more about the anxiety and depression that goes along with looking at your own life.\" He also said of his lyrics, \"This is where we're going to be a year from now, and this is what you're going to be saying about us.\" Wentz described \"I've Got a Dark Alley and a Bad Idea that Says You Should Shut Your Mouth (Summer Song)\" as \"looking in the mirror and not feeling safe in your own skin\".\n\nThe band wanted to create a record that was \"a lot more developed,\" Wentz said. \"When we did \"Take This to Your Grave\", we were really young, we had two weeks to do it and it was like, make it or break it, this is your only shot. This time we had more time to sit with the songs and make them work and more of a chance to plan things out. To us, we're throwing the fight, but we didn't write a record that's throwing a fight. We wrote a record that means a lot to us but maybe isn't going to mean a lot to the people who are hyping us as the next big thing. And that's fine. We don't want to be the saviors of anything — we just want to be ourselves. We made a record we really like, and that's all we ever wanted. Fall Out Boy have never been about goals or ambitions. We started out just for fun, and it became this huge thing. In 2007, it emerged that the band had reached an out of court settlement with American Nightmare vocalist Wesley Eisold, over the use of his poetry in some songs from \"From Under the Cork Tree\" and \"Infinity on High\". The settlement led to future pressings of both albums listing Eisold in the credits.\n\nThe title is taken from a line in the 1936 children's book \"The Story of Ferdinand\" by Munro Leaf, which Wentz was intrigued by. The story focuses on a bull named Ferdinand who would rather sniff flowers under a cork tree than participate in fights. The album cover features a van with a trailer in a slump of snow. This is a reference to the car accident the band was in while they were driving to New York City to film the video for \"Grand Theft Autumn/Where Is Your Boy\" from their album \"Take This to Your Grave\".\n\nCritical reaction to \"From Under the Cork Tree\" was generally positive. In an extremely positive review of the album, Johnny Loftus of Allmusic said: \"Musically, Cork Tree's first five tracks are relentless, with razor-sharp melodies that seem familiar but sound totally unique at the same time. The 'Oh! Oh!'s and punchy chords of 'Of All the Gin Joints in All the World' are a thrill greater than any Jimmy Eat World album ever; 'Sugar, We're Going Down' 's half-time shifts are triumphs of tumbling words; and the opening track meditates wryly on all-ages shows' fame. Further, when Fall Out Boy rip into 'Sophomore Slump or Comeback of the Year,' summer 2005 will not be able to ignore them. 'We're the therapists pumping through your speakers/Delivering just what you need,' they sing. It's obviously time to embrace our inner mall kid.\" \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the album a B+ in one of its \"short takes\" and called it \"Peppy pop-punk aimed at the Warped Tour crowd. If the infectious songs don't get you, the snarky titles will\".\n\nHowever, mixed criticism was dealt by reviewers for the band being part of a saturated scene of pop-punk bands. In \"Rolling Stone\"'s review, they gave it 3 stars out of 5 saying \"...FOB's knack for crafting ginormous, soaring anthems is in full-force: even with its demented, inscrutable lyrics, \"Sugar, We're Goin Down\" will likely still be blasting from radios ten years on.\" Music critic Robert Christgau, in a C+ review of the album, said that \"these Warped Tour cover boys aren't terrible, but are they ever ordinary. Only their record company would claim that emotional vocals, dramatic dynamics, poppy-punky tempos, and not actually all that catchy tunes add up to their own sound.\" \"IGN\" was very negative towards the album, giving it a 3.6 out of 10 saying: \"Pop-punk had to begin somewhere, and when it rains, it apparently pours; Fall Out Boy is merely another addition to a stable bursting at the seams.\"\n\n\"Rolling Stone\" listed it among the \"40 Greatest Emo Albums of All Time\" in 2016, with Brittany Spanos writing it \"changed the course of emo-punk, pop-punk and pop itself with \"From Under the Cork Tree\", which brought the scene mainstream.\"\n\"From Under the Cork Tree\" debuted at No. 2 on the US \"Billboard\" 200 with 168,000 copies sold in its first week. It became the band's first top 10 effort, as their 2003 album \"Take This to Your Grave\" did not chart in the top 200. Logging 78 weeks on the chart, \"Cork Tree\" has sold over 3.7 million copies in the US and over three million worldwide, making it Fall Out Boy's best selling album. It is certified RIAA triple platinum for shipments of three million copies. During Christmas 2005, the album again reached its peak of No. 2 with 257,000 sales, posting the band's second biggest sales week to date as of 2013. By August 2006, the album had sold nearly 3,400,000 copies. Upon the release of Fall Out Boy's 2007 follow-up album \"Infinity on High\", which debuted at No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" 200, \"From Under the Cork Tree\" re-entered the \"Billboard\" 200 at No. 168 with 5,300 sales. In early 2015, the album re-entered the \"Billboard\" 200 at No. 190 for a 78th week on the strength of the band's \"American Beauty/American Psycho\" No. 1 album release.\n\nOn the 2005 year-end charts, \"Cork Tree\" was No. 53 on the \"Billboard\" 200, No. 26 in 2006, and No. 187 on the 2000s decade-end chart.\n\nThree singles were released from this album: \"Sugar, We're Goin' Down\", \"Dance, Dance\" and \"A Little Less Sixteen Candles, a Little More \"Touch Me\"\". The first two singles enjoyed mainstream and commercial success and exposed Fall Out Boy to a new audience. \"From Under the Cork Tree\"s lead single, \"Sugar, We're Goin' Down\", debuted on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 at No. 93 and eleven weeks later it peaked at No. 8 in September 2005. It spent five weeks in the top 10 and 20 weeks (five months) in the top 20, logging a total of 42 weeks on the chart before it was retired. The track received heavy airplay spins on Alternative as well as Pop stations, being a crossover hit. It reached No. 3 on \"Billboard\" Alternative Songs. Its MTV2-award-winning video enjoyed regular rotation on TV music programs. This exposed the band to the mainstream audience and helped them reach great popularity. In the UK, \"Sugar\" also reached No. 8, and spent 21 weeks in the top 75. \"Sugar, We're Goin' Down\" has sold over two million copies in the US and was certified Triple Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting the shipment of three million copies. It stands as the band's best-selling single to date.\n\nThe second single from the album, \"Dance, Dance\" was also released to commercial success, charting at No. 9 in the US in January 2006 and No. 8 in the UK, a second top 10 hit single for the band in both regions. In the US it spent 14 weeks in the top 20 out of a total of 30 chart weeks before it was retired, being certified Platinum by the RIAA for the shipment of one million units. \"Dance, Dance\" is Fall Out Boy's highest hit on Alternative radio, peaking at No. 2 on \"Billboard\" Alternative Songs. It charted at No. 35 on Ireland's singles chart. \"Dance, Dance\"'s music video won awards for \"Viewer's Choice\" and \"Best Group\" at the 2006 MTV awards, two Teen Choice Awards for \"Rock Track\" and \"Single\", and helped the band win \"People's Choice: Favorite International Group\" at the MuchMusic Video Awards.\n\n\"A Little Less Sixteen Candles, a Little More \"Touch Me\"\", the album's third and last single, was much less popular than \"Cork Tree\"s first two singles but managed to reach No. 65 on the Hot 100. It charted for 13 weeks. On \"Billboard\" Alternative Songs, it peaked at No. 38. In the UK, \"Sixteen Candles\" reached No. 38 on the singles chart. The band considered between \"A Little Less Sixteen Candles...\" and \"Sophomore Slump or Comeback of the Year\" as the third and last single, deciding on the former.\n\nOn March 14, 2006, a separate version of the album was released entitled \"From Under the Cork Tree (Limited \"Black Clouds and Underdogs\" edition)\". This consisted of a total 18 tracks, the first 13 being the original release. The album rose to No. 9 on the \"Billboard\" 200 upon its re-release, its second week at its peak position. The three new songs and two dance remixes are as follows and in this order:\nThe iTunes Store released a similar \"From Under the Cork Tree (Limited \"Black Clouds and Underdogs\" Edition)\" EP consisting of 8 tracks: the above 5 as well as the music videos for \"Sugar We're Goin Down\" and \"Dance, Dance\". It also contains a live performance of \"Sugar, We're Goin' Down\".\n\nThe limited edition is sometimes sold along with the regular edition under the same name.\n\nThe album was repressed on vinyl in January 2013 with the bonus \"Black Clouds and Underdogs\" tracks. It was on swirled Maroon vinyl, and limited to 1,500 copies, and exclusively sold at Hot Topic.\n\n\nFall Out Boy\n\nGuest artists\n\nArtwork\n\nOther\n\nChris Cole-Wright - Pan Flute\n\nProduction\n\nManagement \n\n\n"}
{"id": "2012063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2012063", "title": "Aboriginal Protection Board", "text": "Aboriginal Protection Board\n\nAboriginal Protection Board, also known as Aborigines Protection Board, Aborigines Welfare Board, Board for the Protection of Aborigines and similar names, refers to a number of historical Australian State run institutions with the function of regulating the lives of Aboriginal Australians. They were also responsible for administering the various Half-caste acts where these existed and had a key role in the Stolen Generations. The Boards had nearly ultimate control over Aboriginal people's lives.\n\nProtectors of Aborigines were appointed by the Board under the conditions laid down in the various Acts. In theory, Protectors of Aborigines were empowered to undertake legal proceedings on behalf of Aboriginal people, dictate where Aboriginal people could live or work, and keep all wages earned by employed Aboriginals.\n\nAs the Boards had limited funds Protectors received very limited remuneration, and so a range of people were appointed as local Protectors, including Resident Magistrates, Jail Wardens, Justices of the Peace and in some cases ministers of religion, though most were local police inspectors. The minutes of the Board show they mostly dealt with matters of requests from religious bodies for financial relief and reports from Resident or Police Magistrates pertaining to trials and convictions of Aboriginal people under their jurisdiction.\n\nAboriginal Protection Boards also known and issued permits to allow Aboriginal people the right to leave their respective missions and reserves and enter the mainstream society for a set period of time.\n\nThe Victorian Central Board for the Protection of Aborigines was established by the \"Aboriginal Protection Act 1869\" (Vic), replacing the Central Board Appointed to Watch Over the Interests of the Aborigines, and made Victoria the first colony to enact comprehensive regulations on the lives of Victorian Aborigines. The Board exerted an extraordinary level of control over people's lives including regulation of residence, slavery as employment, marriage, social life and other aspects of daily life.\n\nThe Victorian Half-Caste Act (in full, an \"Act to amend an Act entitled \"An Act to Provide for the Protection and Management of the Aboriginal Natives of Victoria\"\") passed in 1886 was an extension and expansion of the \"Aboriginal Protection Act 1869\" which gave extensive powers over the lives of Aboriginal people to the Board for the Protection of Aborigines, including regulation of residence, employment and marriage.\n\nIn particular, the 1886 Act started to remove Aboriginal people of mixed descent, known as \"half-castes\", from Aboriginal stations or reserves to force them to assimilate into European society. These expulsions separated families and communities, causing distress and leading to protest. Nevertheless, the Board refused to assist the expelled people. It was assumed that the expulsions would lead to the decline in the population of the reserves and their eventual closure.\n\nThe Board existed in the following incarnations:\n\n\nThe Board was finally abolished by the \"Aborigines Act 1957\". The \"Aborigines Act 1910\" increased the rights of Aboriginal people in Victoria, but it was only with the \"Aboriginal Lands Act 1970\" that recognition came of Aboriginal people's right to land. Under this Act the deeds of land at the Lake Tyers Mission and Framlingham reserves were transferred to the communities.\n\nThe New South Wales Board for the Protection of Aborigines was established in 1883 and was reconstituted under the \"Aborigines Protection Act 1909\" with wide ranging control over the lives of Aboriginal people, including the power to remove children from families because their parents were Aboriginals, as was written on many of the files, and the power to dictate where Aboriginal people lived to ensure protection from violent colonialists and provide education in the face of European opposition (McCallum, 2008). It also controlled their freedom of movement and personal finances. In particular, Aboriginal children could be removed from their homes and families and taken into care to be raised like white children, thus starting the stolen generation. The 1911 amendment to the \"Aboriginal Protection Act\" established Kinchela Boys Home and Cootamundra Domestic Training Home for Aboriginal Girls. Aboriginal children were removed from their homes for various welfare reasons and transported to Kinchela and Cootamundra, where they were often abused and neglected while being taught farm labouring and domestic work, many of them ending up as servants in the homes of wealthy Sydney residents.\n\nIn 1915, the \"Aborigines Protection Amending Act 1915\" gave the Board authority to remove Aboriginal children \"without having to establish in court that they were neglected.\" \n\nThe Board was renamed the Aborigines Welfare Board in 1940 by the \"Aborigines Protection (Amendment) Act 1940\", which stipulated that Aboriginal people should be assimilated into mainstream white society. The Board consisted of 11 members, including two Aboriginal people, one \"full-blood\" and one having \"a mixture of Aboriginal blood\". This essentially meant that Aboriginal culture should evaporate, and Aboriginal people should eventually become indistinguishable from Europeans. The Aborigines Welfare Board was abolished under the \"Aborigines Act 1969\" (NSW).\n\nThe Western Australian Aborigines Protection Board operated between 1 January 1886 and 1 April 1898 as a statutory authority. It was created by the \"Aborigines Protection Act 1886\" (WA), also known as the \"Half-Caste Act\", \"An Act to provide for the better protection and management of the Aboriginal natives of Western Australia, and to amend the law relating to certain contracts with such Aboriginal natives\" (statute 25/1886); \"An Act to provide certain matters connected with the Aborigines\" (statute 24/1889). \n\nThe 1886 Act was enacted following the furore over the Fairburn Report (which revealed slavery conditions among Aboriginal farm workers) and the work of the Rev. John Gribble. The Act introduced employment contracts between employers and Aboriginal workers over the age of 14. There was no provision in the 1886 Act for contracts to include wages. But, employees were to be provided with \"substantial, good and sufficient rations\", clothing and blankets. The 1886 Act provided a resident magistrate with the power to indenture 'half-caste' and Aboriginal children, from a suitable age, until they turned 21. An Aboriginal Protection Board, was also established to prevent the abuses reported earlier, but rather than protect Aborigines, it mainly succeeded in putting them under tighter government control. It was intended to enforce contracts, employment of prisoners and apprenticeships, but there was not sufficient power to enforce clauses in the north, and they were openly flouted. The Act defined as \"Aboriginal\" \"every Aboriginal native of Australia, every Aboriginal half-caste, or child of a half-caste\". Governor Broome insisted that the act contain within it a clause permitting traditional owners to continue hunting on their tribal lands.\n\nThe effect of the Act was to give increasing power to the Board over Aboriginal people, rather than setting up a system to punish whites for wrongdoing in relation to Aboriginal people. An Aboriginal Department was set up, under the office of the Chief Protector of Aborigines. Nearly half of the Legislative Council voted to amend the act for contract labour as low as age 10 but it was defeated. McKenzie Grant, the member for The North, claimed that child labour of age six or seven was a necessary commonplace, as \"in this way they gradually become domesticated\". The Attorney General Septimus Burt, in debate on the 2nd reading speech, claimed that contracts were being issued, not for current work, but to hold Aboriginal people as slaves on stations for potential future work, and so prevent them from being free to leave.\n\nIn 1898, the Board was replaced by the Aborigines Department.\n\nA Queensland Aboriginal Protection Board was established by the \"Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act 1897\".\nThe \"Aborigines Act Amendment Act 1939\" created the Aborigines Protection Board in South Australia, which was \"charged with the duty of controlling and promoting the welfare\" of Aboriginal people (which included anyone descended from an Aboriginal person). Charles Duguid was a founding board member; other board members included J. B. Cleland and Constance Cooke.\n\nBy the late 1960s, all states and territories had repealed the legislation allowing for the removal of Aboriginal children under the policy of 'protection'.\n\n\n"}

In 1993 the borders of the riding of Pincher Creek-Crowsnest shifted south into Cardston, and the riding was renamed Cardston-Chief Mountain.\n\nThe riding was named after the town of Cardston and this region is considered one of the most conservative in the province.\n\nCardston electoral district was created in 1905 when Alberta became a province. The electoral district replaced the previous Cardston territorial electoral district represented in the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories from 1902 to 1905.\n\nThe 1905 election was between Liberal candidate John William Woolf and Conservative candidate John Parrish. Woolf was well known rancher and politician in the area. He had served as the district representative in the Northwest Territories Legislature from 1902 to 1905. Woolf also served briefly on the local government as a municipal councilor in the town of Cardston. Woolf won the district on election day easily defeating Parish with a landslide taking nearly 70% of the popular vote.\n\nDistrict results from the first province wide plebiscite on electricity regulation.\n\nOn October 30, 1957 a stand-alone plebiscite was held province wide in all 50 of the provincial electoral districts in Alberta. The government decided to consult Alberta voters to decide on liquor sales and mixed drinking after a divisive debate in the Legislature. The plebiscite was intended to deal with the growing demand for reforming antiquated liquor control laws.\n\nThe plebiscite was conducted in two parts. Question A asked in all districts, asked the voters if the sale of liquor should be expanded in Alberta, while Question B asked in a handful of districts within the corporate limits of Calgary and Edmonton asked if men and woman were allowed to drink together in establishments.\n\nProvince wide Question A of the plebiscite passed in 33 of the 50 districts while Question B passed in all five districts. Cardston recorded the strongest vote in the province against expanded sale of liquor, this was likely due to the strong Mormon communities in the district, which had made Cardston a dry city since 1904. The district also recorded a strong voter turnout. It was well above the province wide average of 46 percent.\n\nOfficial district returns were released to the public on December 31, 1957. At first the Social Credit government said it did not consider the results binding, but soon the government repealed the existing liquor legislation and introduced an entirely new \"Liquor Act\".\n\nMunicipal districts lying inside electoral districts that voted against expanded liquor sales such as Cardston were designated Local Option Zones by the Alberta Liquor Control Board and considered effective dry zones, business owners that wanted a license had to petition for a binding municipal plebiscite in order to be granted a license.\n\n"}

Forms similar to many modern insects had already evolved before the dawning of the dinosaur and lived alongside them and beyond up to the present day.

{"id": "2012090", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2012090", "title": "One-pass compiler", "text": "One-pass compiler\n\nIn computer programming, a one-pass compiler is a compiler that passes through the parts of each compilation unit only once, immediately translating each part into its final machine code. This is in contrast to a multi-pass compiler which converts the program into one or more intermediate representations in steps between source code and machine code, and which reprocesses the entire compilation unit in each sequential pass.\n\nThis refers to the logical functioning of the compiler, not to the actual reading of the source file once only. For instance, the source file could be read once into temporary storage but that copy could then be scanned many times. The IBM 1130 Fortran compiler stored the source in memory and used many passes; by contrast the assembler, on systems lacking a disc storage unit, required that the source deck of cards be presented twice to the card reader/punch.\n\nOne-pass compilers are smaller and faster than multi-pass compilers.\n\nOne-pass compilers are unable to generate as efficient programs as multi-pass compilers due to the limited scope of available information. Many effective compiler optimizations require multiple passes over a basic block, loop (especially nested loops), subroutine, or entire module. Some require passes over an entire program. Some programming languages simply cannot be compiled in a single pass, as a result of their design. For example PL/I allows data declarations to be placed anywhere within a program, specifically, \"after\" some references to the not-yet-declared items, so no code can be generated until the entire program has been scanned. The language definition also includes pre-processor statements that generate source code to be compiled: multiple passes are certain. In contrast, many programming languages have been designed specifically to be compiled with one-pass compilers, and include special constructs to allow one-pass compilation.\n\nThe basic problem is of forward references. The correct interpretation of a symbol at some point in the source file may be dependent on the presence or absence of other symbols further on in the source file and until they are encountered, correct code for the current symbol cannot be produced. This is the problem of context dependence, and the span can be anywhere from adjacent symbols to arbitrarily large amounts of source text.\n\nSuppose that the symbol < is recognized as being for a \"less than\" comparison, as opposed to \"greater than\" for example. Because of character coding limitations, the glyph ≤ may not be available in a standard encoding, so a compound representation is to be allowed, \"<=\". Even though this context is determined by the very next symbol, it is unknown when \"<\" is encountered. Similarly, the symbol \"=\" does not always mean \"=\", as when it is a part of a compound symbol. Other compound symbols might include \".lt.\" for the case when the special character \"<\" is unavailable. Yet another possibility where a character code for the glyph ¬ (\"not\") is unavailable is \"<>\" for \"¬=\" or \"not equal\" - some systems employ ~ or ! for ¬ as still further variation. One approach is to advance the scan after \"<\" and on encountering the \"=\", backtrack. This of course means that there will be two passes over that portion of text, which is to be avoided. For that matter, the source file may come from a device not supporting a go-back-and-reread operation, such as a card reader. Instead of making an early decision that may later have to be undone, the lexical analyser can maintain multiple interpretations rather like the notion of Quantum Superposition, collapsing to a specific choice only on later observing the determining symbol. Notably, COBOL compilers devote a pass to distinguishing between full stops appearing in decimal constants and the full stops that appear at the end of statements. Such a scheme is unavailable to a single-pass compiler.\n\nSimilarly with the names of items. Few languages restrict themselves to single-character names, so the character \"x\" as a single-character name is quite different from the character \"x\" within a name such as \"text\" - now the context extends beyond the immediately adjacent characters. It is the task of the lexical analyser to separate the items of the sequential source stream into the tokens of the language. Not just words, because \"<\" and \"<=\" are tokens also. Names typically start with a letter and continue with letters and digits, and perhaps a few additional symbols such as \"_\". The syntax allowed for specifying numbers is surprisingly complex, for example +3.14159E+0 can be valid. It is usual to allow an arbitrary number of space characters between tokens, and fortran is unusual in allowing (and ignoring) spaces within apparent tokens also so that \"GO TO\" and \"GOTO\" are equivalent as are \"<=\" and \"< =\". However, some systems may require spaces to delimit certain tokens, and others, such as Python, use leading spaces to indicate the scope of program blocks that otherwise might be indicated by Begin ... End or similar markers.\n\nLanguages that allow arithmetic expressions typically follow the syntax of infix notation with precedence rules. This means than the generation of code for an expression's evaluation does not proceed smoothly as the expression's tokens are elicited from the source text. For example, the expression x + y*(u - v) does not lead to the equivalent of load x, add y, because x is not added to y. If a stack scheme is used for arithmetic, the code may start with a Load x, but the code that corresponds to the following + token does not then follow. Instead, code for (u - v) is generated, followed by multiplication by y, and only then is x added. The parser of arithmetic expressions does not move back and forth along the source during its analysis, it employs a local stack of deferred operations driven by the precedence rules. This dance can be avoided by requiring that arithmetic expressions be presented in Reverse Polish notation or similar; for the above example something like u v - y * x + and which would be scanned strictly left-to-right.\n\nAn optimising compiler may analyse the form of an arithmetic expression, to identify and remove repetition or make other potential improvements. Consider\nSome languages, such as Algol, allow assignments within an arithmetic expression, so the programmer could have written something like\nbut aside from the exertion required to do so, the resulting statement's form is messy and will no longer be easily compared to the mathematical expression being coded for. Mistakes would be easily made. Instead, the compiler could represent the entire expression's form (typically using a tree structure), analyse and modify that structure, and then emit the code for the improved form. There would be an obvious extension to blocks of successive assignment statements. This does not involve a second pass through the source text, as such.\n\nAlthough the lexical analyser has split the input stream into a stream of tokens (and discarded any commentary), the interpretation of these tokens according to the language's syntax may yet depend on the context. Consider the following statements in fortran pseudo code:\nThe first is the assignment of the value of some arithmetic expression (the \"etc\") to an element of a one-dimensional array called \"if\". Fortran is unusual in that it contains \"no\" reserved words, so a token \"write\" does not necessarily mean that there is a write-statement in progress. The other statements are indeed if-statements - the second is an arithmetic-if that examines the sign of the result of the expression and based on it being negative, zero, or positive jumps to label 1, 2, or 3; the third is a logical-if, and requires that the result of its expression be boolean - thus, the correct interpretation of the token \"if\" emerging from the lexical analyser cannot be made until \"after\" the expression has been scanned and following the closing bracket there appears either an equals sign, a digit (being the text of \"label1\": fortran uses only integers as labels though if letters were allowed the scan would have to rely on finding the commas) or something starting with a letter (that must be \"then\"), and so now, the context spans an arbitrary amount of source text because the \"expression\" is arbitrary. However, in all three cases the compiler can generate the code for evaluating the \"expression\" as its scan advances. Thus, the lexical analysis cannot always determine the meaning of the tokens it has just identified because of the vagaries of the allowable syntax, and so the syntax analysis must maintain a superposition of possible states if backtracking is to be avoided.\n\nWith the syntax analysis adrift in a fog of superposed states, should an error be encountered (that is, a token is found that cannot be fitted into any valid syntactic frame) the production of a helpful message can be difficult. The B6700 Algol compiler for example was notorious for error messages such as \"semicolon expected\" along with a listing of the source line plus a marker showing the location of trouble - often marking a semicolon. In the absence of a semicolon, if one were indeed placed as indicated, on recompilation there could well arise a message \"unexpected semicolon\" for it. Often, only the first error message from a compiler will be worth attending to, because subsequent messages went awry. Cancelling the current interpretation then resuming the scan at the start of the next statement is difficult when the source file is in error, and so subsequent messages are unhelpful. Further code production is of course abandoned.\n\nThis problem can be reduced through the employment of reserved words, so that for example \"if\", \"then\", and \"else\" always are parts of an if-statement and cannot be names of variables, but a surprisingly large number of useful words may thereby become unavailable. Another approach is \"stropping\", whereby reserved words are marked off, say by placing them between special characters such as full stops, or apostrophes as in some versions of Algol. This means that codice_1 and codice_2 are different tokens, the latter being an ordinary name, but supplying all those apostrophes soon becomes irksome. For many languages, spacing supplies sufficient information though this may be complex. Often it is not just a space (or tab, etc.) but a character other than a letter or digit that terminates a possible token's text. In the above example, the \"expression\" of the if-statement must be within brackets so that the \"(\" definitely ends the identification of \"if\" and similarly, \")\" enables the identification of \"then\"; further, other parts of a compound if-statement must appear on new lines: \"else\" and \"end if\" (or \"endif\") and \"else if\". By contrast, with Algol and others the brackets are not needed and all the parts of an if-statement can be on one line. With Pascal, if a or b then \"etc.\" is valid, but if \"a\" and \"b\" are expressions, then they must be enclosed in brackets.\n\nSource file listings produced by the compiler can be made easier to read by having the reserved words it identifies presented underlined or in bold or \"italic\", but there has been criticism: \"Algol is the only language that distinguishes between an italic and normal full stop\". Actually this is no joking matter. In fortran, a do-statement's start such as codice_3 is distinguished from codice_4 (an assignment of the value 1.15 to a variable called codice_5; recall that spaces are irrelevant) only by the difference between a comma and a full stop, and a printed listing's glyphs may not be well-formed. \n\nCareful attention to the design of a language can promote clarity and simplicity of expression with a view to creating a reliable compiler whose behaviour is easily understandable. Yet poor choices are common. For example, Matlab denotes matrix transposition by using an apostrophe as in A' which is unexceptionable and closely follows mathematical usage. Well and good, but for the delimiters of a text string Matlab ignores the opportunity presented by the double quote symbol for any purpose and uses apostrophes for this as well. Though Octave uses double quotes for text strings, it strives to accept Matlab statements as well and so the problem extends to another system.\n\nIt is at this stage that pre-processor options are exercised, so called because they are exercised previous to the compiler proper processing the incoming source. They echo the \"macro expansion\" options of assembler systems, hopefully with a more gracious syntax. The most common arrangement is a variation on\noften with some arrangement to distinguish pre-processor source statements from \"ordinary\" source statements, such as the statement starting with a % symbol in pl/i, or a #, etc. Another simple option is a variation of\nBut caution is needed, as in\nSince without the brackets, the result would be sum:=3*x + y; Similarly, caution is needed in determining the bounds of the replacement text and how the resulting text will be scanned. Consider\nHere the define statement is terminated by a semicolon, and the semicolon is not itself a part of the replacement. The invocation can't be codice_6 because that is a different name, but codice_7 would be codice_8 and the subsequent scan may or may not be able to regard that as a single token.\n\nSome systems allow the definition of pre-processor procedures whose output is source text to be compiled, and may even allow such source to define still further pre-processor items. Adroit usage of such options allows for constants to be given explanatory names, recondite details to be replaced by easy mnemonics, the appearance of new statement forms, and the generation of in-line code for specific usages of a general procedure (such as sorting), rather than devise actual procedures. With a proliferation of parameters and parameter types, the number of combinations required grows exponentially.\n\nFurther, the same pre-processor syntax could be used for multiple different languages, even natural languages as in the generation of a story from a story template using a person's name, nickname, name of pet dog, etc. and the temptation would be to devise a pre-processor programme which would accept the source file, perform the pre-processor actions and output the result ready for the next stage, the compilation. But this clearly constitutes at least one extra pass through the source and so such a solution would be unavailable to a single-pass compiler. Thus, progress through the actual input source file may well advance in fits and starts, but it is still unidirectional.\n\nCode generation by the compiler also faces the problem of forwards reference, most directly in the likes of Go to \"label\" where the destination label is an unknown distance further ahead in the source file, and thus the jump instruction to reach that label's location involves an unknown distance across yet-to-be-generated code. Some language designs, influenced perhaps by \"GOTOs considered harmful\", do not have a GOTO statement, but this does not evade the problem as there are many implicit GOTO equivalents in a program. Consider\nAs mentioned before, code to evaluate the \"condition\" can be generated straight away. But when the then token is encountered, a JumpFalse operation code must be placed whose destination address is the start of the code for the \"code false\" statements, and similarly, when the else token is encountered, the just-completed code for the \"code true\" statements must be followed by a GOTO-style jump operation whose destination is the code that follows the end of the if-statement, here marked by the fi token. These destinations are knowable only after an arbitrary amount of code is generated for the as-yet unscanned source. Similar problems arise for any statement whose parts span arbitrary amounts of source, such as the case statement.\n\nA recursive-descent compiler would activate a procedure for each type of statement, such as an if-statement, in turn invoking the appropriate procedures to generate the code for the statements of the \"code true\" and \"code false\" parts of its statement and similarly for the other statements according to their syntax. In its local storage it would keep track of the location of the address field of its incomplete JumpFalse operation, and on encountering its then token, would place the now-known address, and similarly on encountering the fi token for the jump needed after the \"code true\" code. The GoTo statement differs in that the code to be jumped over is not inside its statement form, so an entry in an auxiliary table of \"fixups\" is needed that would be used when finally its label is encountered. This notion could be extended. All unknown-destination jumps could be made via an entry in a jump table (whose addresses are later filled in as the destinations are encountered), however the necessary size of this table is unknown until the end of the compilation.\n\nOne solution to this is for the compiler to emit assembler source (with compiler-generated labels as the destinations for jumps, etc.), and the assembler would determine the actual addresses. But this clearly requires an additional pass through (a version of) the source file and so is disallowed for single-pass compilers.\n\nAlthough the description above has employed the notion that code may be generated with certain fields left to be fixed up later, there was an implicit assumption that the size of such code sequences was stable. This may not be the case. Many computers have provision for operations occupying different amounts of storage, notably relative addressing whereby if the destination is within say -128 or +127 addressing steps then an eight-bit address field can be used, otherwise a much larger address field is required to reach. Thus if the code were generated with a hopeful short address field, later it may become necessary to go back and adjust the code to use a longer field, with the consequence that earlier code referencing locations after the change will have to be adjusted as well. Likewise, later references going backwards across the change will have to be fixed, even those that had been to known addresses. And as well, the fixup information will itself have to be fixed, correctly. On the other hand, long addresses could be used for all cases when nearness is not certain, but the resulting code will no longer be the best possible...\n\nAlready mentioned are some possibilities for optimisation within a single statement. Optimisations across multiple statements would require that the content of such statements be held in some sort of data structure that could be analysed and manipulated before code is emitted. In such a case, producing provisional code, even with fixups allowed for, would be a hindrance. In the limit this means the compiler would generate a data structure representing the entire program in an internal form, but a straw could be clutched and the claim made that there is no actual second pass of the source file from start to end. Possibly in the PR document advertising the compiler.\n\nNotably therefore, a compiler cannot generate its code in a single relentlessly-forwards sequence, still less immediately as each part of the source is read. The output could still be written sequentially, but only if output of a section is deferred until all pending fixups for that section have been made.\n\nWhen generating code for the various expressions, the compiler needs to know the nature of the operands. For example, a statement such as A:=B; could produce rather different code depending on whether A and B are integers or floating-point variables (and what size: single, double or quadruple precision) or complex numbers, arrays, strings, programmer-defined types, etc. In this case, a simple approach would be to transfer a suitable number of words of storage, but, for strings this could be unsuitable as the recipient may be smaller than the supplier and in any case, only a part of the string may be used - perhaps it has space for a thousand characters, but currently contains ten. Then there are more complex constructions, as offered by COBOL and pl/i, such as codice_9 In this case, A and B are aggregates (or structures) with A having for example parts codice_10, codice_11 and codice_12 while B has parts codice_13, codice_14 and codice_15, and in that order. The \"by name\" feature means the equivalent of codice_16 But because codice_14 has no counterpart in A, and codice_12 has no counterpart in B, they are not involved.\n\nAll of this can be handled by the requirement that items are declared before they are used. Some languages do not require explicit declarations, generating an implicit declaration on first encountering a new name. Should a fortran compiler encounter a previously-unknown name whose first letter is one of I,J...,N, then the variable will be an integer, otherwise a floating-point variable. Thus a name codice_5 would be a floating-point variable. This is a convenience, but after a few experiences with mistyped names, most programmers agree that the compiler option \"implicit none\" should be used.\n\nOther systems use the nature of the first encounter to decide the type, such as a string, or an array, and so forth. Interpreted languages can be particularly flexible, with the decision being made at run time, somewhat as follows\nShould there be a compiler for such a language, it would have to create a complex entity to represent the variable pi, containing an indication as to just what its current type is and associated storage to represent such a type. This is certainly flexible, but may not be helpful for intensive computation as in solving A.x = b where A is a matrix of order a hundred, and suddenly, any one of its elements may be of a different type.\n\nDeclaration before use is likewise an easy requirement to meet for procedures and functions, and this applies also to the nesting of procedures within procedures. As with ALGOL, Pascal, PL/I and many others, MATLAB and (since 1995) Fortran allow a function (or procedure) to contain the definition of another function (or procedure), visible only within the containing function, but these systems require that they be defined \"after\" the end of the containing procedure.\n\nBut when recursion is allowed, a problem arises. Two procedures, each invoking the other, cannot both be declared before usage. One must be first in the source file. This need not matter if, as on the encounter with an unknown variable, sufficient can be deduced from the encounter that the compiler could generate suitable code for the invocation of the unknown procedure, with of course the \"fixup\" apparatus in place to come back and fill in the correct address for the destination when the procedure's definition is encountered. This would be the case for a procedure with no parameters, for example. The returned result from a function invocation may be of a type discernable from the invocation, but this may not always be correct: a function could return a floating-point result but have its value assigned to an integer.\n\nPascal solves this problem by requiring \"predeclaration.\" One of the procedure or function declarations must be given first, but, instead of the body of the procedure or function, the keyword forward is given. Then the other procedure or function can be declared and its body defined. At some point the \"forward\" procedure or function is redeclared, along with the body of the function.\n\nFor the invocation of a procedure (or function) with parameters, their type will be known (they being declared before use) but their usage in the procedure invocation may not be. Fortran for example passes all parameters by reference (i.e. by address) so there is no immediate difficulty with generating the code (as always, with actual addresses to be fixed up later), but Pascal and other languages allow parameters to be passed by different methods at the programmer's choice (by reference, or by value, or even perhaps by \"name\") and this is signified only in the definition of the procedure, which is unknown before the definition has been encountered. Specifically for Pascal, in the specification of parameters a prefix \"Var\" signifies that it must be received by reference, its absence signifies by value. In the first case the compiler must generate code that passes the address of the parameter, while in the second it must generate different code that passes a copy of the value, usually via a stack. As always, a \"fixup\" mechanism could be invoked to deal with this, but it would be very messy. Multi-pass compilers can of course collate all the required information as they shuttle back and forth, but single-pass compilers cannot. Code generation could be paused while the scan advances (and its results be held in internal storage) until such time as the needed entity is encountered, and this might not be regarded as resulting in a second pass through the source because the code generation stage will soon catch up, it was merely halting for a while. But this would be complex. Instead a special construction is introduced, whereby the procedure's definition of parameter usage is declared \"forward\" of its later full definition so that the compiler may know it before use, as it requires.\n\nFrom First Fortran (1957) onwards, separate compilation of portions of a program has been possible, supporting the creation of libraries of procedures and functions. A procedure in the source file being compiled that invokes a function from such an outside collection must know the type of result returned by the unknown function, if only to generate code that looks in the right place to find the result. Originally, when there were only integers and floating-point variables, the choice could be left to the rules for implicit declaration, but with the proliferation of sizes and also types the invoking procedure will need a type declaration for the function. This is not special, having the same form as for a variable declared inside the procedure.\n\nThe requirement to be met is that at the current point in a single-pass compilation, information on an entity is needed so that the correct code for it can be produced now, if with address fixups later. Whether the required information will be encountered later on in the source file or is to be found in some separately-compiled code file, the information is provided by some protocol here.\n\nWhether or not all invocations of a procedure (or function) are checked for compatibility with each other and their definitions is a separate matter. In languages descended from Algol-like inspiration, this checking is usually rigorous, but other systems can be indifferent. Leaving aside systems that allow a procedure to have optional parameters, mistakes in the number and type of parameters will normally cause a program to crash. Systems that allow separate compilation of parts of a complete programme that later are \"linked\" together should also check for the correct type and number of parameters and results as mistakes are even easier to make, but often do not. Some languages (such as Algol) have a formal notion of \"upgrading\" or \"widening\" or \"promotion\", whereby a procedure that expects say a double-precision parameter may be invoked with it as a single precision variable, and in this case the compiler generates code that stores the single precision variable into a temporary double-precision variable which becomes the actual parameter. This however changes the parameter passing mechanism to copy-in, copy-out which may lead to subtle differences in behaviour. Far less subtle are the consequences when a procedure receives the address of a single precision variable when it expects a double precision parameter, or other size variations. When within the procedure the parameter's value is read, more storage will be read than that of its given parameter and the resulting value is unlikely to be an improvement. Far worse is when the procedure changes the value of its parameter: something is sure to be damaged. Much patience can be expended in finding and correcting these oversights.\n\nAn example of such a construct is the forward declaration in Pascal. Pascal requires that procedures be declared or fully defined before use. This helps a one-pass compiler with its type checking: calling a procedure that hasn't been declared anywhere is a clear error. Forward declarations help mutually recursive procedures call each other directly, despite the declare-before-use rule:\nfunction odd(n : integer) : boolean;\nbegin\nend;\n\nfunction even(n : integer) : boolean;\nbegin\nend;\nBy adding a forward declaration for the function codice_20 before the function codice_21, the one-pass compiler is told that there will be a definition of codice_20 later on in the program.\nfunction even(n : integer) : boolean; forward;\n\nfunction odd(n : integer) : boolean;\nWhen the actual declaration of the body of the function is made, either the parameters are omitted or must be absolutely identical to the original forward declaration, or an error will be flagged.\n\nWhen declaring complex data aggregates, a possible usage of functions Odd and Even could arise. Perhaps if a data aggregate X has a storage size that is an odd number of bytes, a single byte item might be added to it under the control of a test upon Odd(ByteSize(X)) so as to make an even number. Given the equivalent declarations of Odd and Even as above, a \"forward\" declaration probably wouldn't be needed because the usage of the parameters is known to the pre-processor which is unlikely to present opportunities to choose between by reference and by value. However, there could be no invocations of these functions in the source code (outside their definitions) until after their actual definition, because the result of the invocation is required to be known. Unless of course the pre-processor engaged in multiple passes of its source file.\n\nAnyone who has attempted to maintain coherence amongst the declarations and usages of procedures in a large program and its usage of libraries of routines, especially one undergoing changes, will have struggled over the usage of forward or similar added declarations for procedures invoked but not defined in the current compilation. Maintaining synchrony between widely-separated locations especially across different source files requires diligence. Those declarations using the reserved word are easy to find, but if the helpful declarations are not distinguished from ordinary declarations, the task becomes troublesome. The gain of supposedly swifter compilation may seem insufficient when simply abandoning the goal of one-pass compilation would remove this imposition.\n\n"}

{"id": "2012096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2012096", "title": "Mick Mills", "text": "Mick Mills\n\nMichael Dennis Mills MBE (born 4 January 1949) is an English former footballer who played for Ipswich Town, Southampton and Stoke City. He managed Stoke City, Colchester United and Birmingham City. During his career he achieved Ipswich Town's record number of appearances and captained England at the 1982 World Cup.\n\nMills joined Portsmouth as a schoolboy, but the club abandoned its youth system, forcing him to look for a new club to begin his fledgling career. Ipswich Town took him on and he made his debut for the first team in 1966, aged just 17, in a 5–2 victory against Wolverhampton Wanderers. A full back who could play on either side but was more frequently used on the left, Mills spent his late teens in and out of the Ipswich first team but became an established regular in 1969, the year the club achieved promotion to the First Division. It was also the year that Bobby Robson arrived as manager. \n\nRobson appointed Mills as team captain in 1971 and so began a close working relationship between coach and skipper which was at the forefront of Ipswich's rise to the top of the game for a decade. In 1973, Ipswich finished fourth in the First Division, won the Texaco Cup and qualified for the UEFA Cup. Ipswich began to finish in the top sector of the First Division with some regularity and played in numerous European competitions, but actual success seemed to elude them. Mills was the experienced captain of a young side consisting mainly of players brought through the ranks. They achieved third place in the First Division in 1977 and expected to go better than that the following year.\nHowever, that subsequent season in the First Division for Ipswich was disappointing as they struggled to find any consistency and finished a lowly 16th. There was a tremendous bonus for them in the FA Cup, however, as they reached the final where they beat favourites Arsenal 1–0 at Wembley. Mills, as captain, lifted the trophy - Ipswich's first major honour for 16 years. Ipswich, meanwhile, continued to hit high spots, finishing in the top five every year between 1978 and 1982, including a memorable season in 1981 which saw them just miss out on First Division and FA Cup glory, but won the UEFA Cup, which Mills duly collected after victory over AZ 67 Alkmaar in the final.\n\nIn the same year, Robson had told a 33-year-old Mills that his contract at Ipswich would not be renewed. Mills joined Southampton in November 1982 for £40,000, while Robson became Ron Greenwood's replacement as England manager, thereby ending Mills' international career too. He made 741 appearances for Ipswich over 17 years, a club record.\n\nHe joined Southampton in November 1982 and spent three seasons at The Dell making 123 appearances before leaving in the summer of 1985 to become player-manager at Stoke City. At Stoke Mills played himself 44 times before deciding to retire from playing at the age of 38.\n\nDuring the 1972–73 season, England manager Alf Ramsey gave Mills his first international cap in a 1–1 draw with Yugoslavia at Wembley. Mills played at right back, a position which became more familiar to him with England than with Ipswich as his career continued. His second cap came in 1976 against Wales and he had eleven by the end of the 1977 campaign.\n\nWhile his club had finally won a trophy, Mills' international career was in a semi-statuesque state. Don Revie had given him a number of games at left back, including the opening qualifiers for the 1978 World Cup (a straightforward 4–1 win for England over Finland, followed by a disappointing 2–0 defeat to Italy) but Mills had to cope with lots of competition for both full back slots. After Revie's departure, successor Ron Greenwood seemed to prefer Liverpool's Phil Neal at right back and Leeds United's Trevor Cherry at left back, with Mills as reserve for both. He didn't play in any of the remaining qualifying games, and England failed to reach the finals. Mills, however, started to become a regular in the England set-up in 1978 though some confusion continued over his best position as, of the eight internationals during that year, he played six at left back (with Neal on the right) and two at right back (with Cherry down the left). Mills sacrificed his place in the final England game of 1978, against Czechoslovakia, when Nottingham Forest right back Viv Anderson was handed his debut, becoming England's first black player.\n\nAnother young debutant, Kenny Sansom, emerged in 1979 to give Mills food for thought in the other full back slot, but he began to settle in at left back for his country as England qualified for the 1980 European Championships. Mills was named in Greenwood's squad but by now Sansom was an established option in the left back slot and he got the nod over Mills in England's opening two group games - a draw with Belgium and a defeat against hosts Italy - before Mills returned for the final game against Spain, which, despite an England win, saw their exit from the tournament. Mills played four England matches in 1981 - notably, they were all World Cup qualifiers for the 1982 tournament, with Greenwood happy to use less experienced players like Anderson and Sansom in the friendly games which preceded them. When England beat Hungary at Wembley in their final qualifier to reach their first World Cup in a dozen years, Mills won his 35th cap.\n\nStill switching flanks for his country when required (but rarely for club - he was almost always the left back), Mills played in just two of the preparation matches for the competition, but was named in the team as right back and captain (squad captain Kevin Keegan was injured) when England played their first game of the tournament against France in Bilbao. England won 3–1 and Mills stayed in the side for the remaining group matches, both of which England also won, although he switched to left back for the final match to allow a run-out for Neal. Greenwood reverted to a Mills-Sansom full back pairing for the second phase, but two goalless draws against West Germany and Spain (the latter of which finally saw Keegan's return to the team) sent England out of the competition.\n\nIn 1985, Mills became player-manager of Stoke City with Sammy Chung as his assistant. Mills joined Stoke with the club a very poor position having just been relegated from the First Division with a record low points tally and with little money available. He sent about trying to restore some pride into the support and began well as Stoke beat Leeds United 6–2 on the third match of the 1985–86. Money was still a major problem so he sold Mark Chamberlain to Portsmouth for £300,000 but typical of the financial climate at Stoke the money was used to reduce the club's overdraft. Results slowly improved and Stoke finished the season in 10th place in what was a season of recovery. More player sales followed in 1986–87 but the arrival of Peter Coates as chairman allowed for some new players to arrive most notably Lee Dixon, Nicky Morgan and former Ipswich teammate Brian Talbot. Morale was boosted again thanks to another large win over Leeds United (7–2) as Stoke climbed up the table into the play-offs. However their form could not be maintained and they had to settle for 8th position.\n\nThe 1987–88 season was a frustrating one for Stoke as little progress was made a poor position of 11th was the final outcome with Dixon and Steve Bould both being sold to Arsenal. The 1988–89 season again saw Stoke finish in mid-table which prompted speculation that Mills would not be offered a new contract. In the end he was given a 'final chance' to get Stoke promoted and he was given a £1 million transfer budget by Coates for the 1989–90 season. He spent it all breaking the club's record transfer of £480,000 for Sheffield Wednesday defender Ian Cranson, £75,000 on Derek Statham from West Bromwich Albion, £175,000 for Ian Scott and £250,000 for Wayne Biggins both from Manchester City. However results were terrible and with Stoke rock bottom and heading into the third tier for the first time since 1927 he was sacked in November 1989.\n\nThe following year he became manager of Colchester United, but was sacked after only a few months when they were relegated to the Conference. Mills became chief scout for Sheffield Wednesday and then a coach at Birmingham City - at one point becoming caretaker manager after the dismissal of Trevor Francis.\n\nSource:\n\nSource:\n\nMills is now technical director of Galaxy Sports Management and is a football summariser for BBC Radio Suffolk, which he continues to do to this day on match day live.\n\nIn 2010, Mills was named a patron of the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation. He was awarded the MBE for services to football.\n\nIpswich Town\n\nSouthampton\n\nIndividual\n\n"}

The tale was first published in Copenhagen by C.A. Reitzel on 2 October 1838 in the first booklet of \"Fairy Tales Told for Children. New Collection.\" The booklet consists of Andersen's \"The Daisy\" and \"The Wild Swans\". The tale was Andersen's first not based upon a folk tale or a literary model. \"The Steadfast Tin Soldier\" has been adapted to various media including ballet and animated film.\n\nOn his birthday, a boy receives a set of 25 toy soldiers all cast from one old tin spoon and arrays them on a table top. One soldier stands on a single leg, as having been the last one cast there was not enough metal to make him whole. Nearby, the soldier spies a pretty paper ballerina with a spangle on her sash. She, too, is standing on one leg, and the soldier falls in love. That night, a goblin among the toys in the form of a jack-in-the-box, who also loves the ballerina, angrily warns the soldier to take his eyes off her, but the soldier ignores him.\n\nThe next day, the soldier falls from a windowsill (presumably the work of the goblin) and lands in the street. Two boys find the soldier, place him in a paper boat, and set him sailing in the gutter. The boat and its passenger wash into a storm drain, where a rat demands the soldier pay a toll.\n\nSailing on, the boat is washed into a canal, where the tin soldier is swallowed by a fish. When this fish is caught and cut open, the tin soldier finds himself once again on the table top before the ballerina. Inexplicably, the boy throws the tin soldier into the fire, which is most likely the work of the jack-in-the-box goblin. A wind blows the ballerina into the fire with him; she is consumed by it. The maid cleans the fireplace in the morning and finds that the soldier has melted into a little tin heart, along with the ballerina's spangle, which is now burned black as coal.\n\nThe tale was first published in Copenhagen, Denmark by C. A. Reitzel on 2 October 1838 in \"Fairy Tales Told for Children. New Collection. First booklet.\" Other tales in the booklet include \"The Daisy\" and \"The Wild Swans\". The tale was republished in collected editions of Andersen's work, first, on 18 December 1849 in \"Fairy Tales\" and again on 15 December 1862 in the first volume of \"Fairy Tales and Stories\".\n\n\"The Steadfast Tin Soldier\" is the first tale Andersen wrote that has neither a literary model nor a folk tale source. It marks a new independence in his writing, and is the zenith of his evocation of the nineteenth-century nursery world with its toy dancers, castles, and swans.\n\nJoan G. Haahr writes in \"The Oxford Companion to Fairy Tales\": \"The story is unusual among Andersen's early tales, both in its emphasis on sensual desire and in its ambiguities. Blind fate, not intention, determines all events. Moreover, the narrative questions the very decorum it praises. The tin soldier's passive acceptance of whatever happens to him, while exemplifying pietistic ideals of self-denial, also contributes to his doom. Were he to speak and act, the soldier might gain both life and love. Restrained, however, by inhibition and convention, he finds only tragedy and death. The tale is often read autobiographically, with the soldier viewed as symbolizing Andersen's feelings of inadequacy with women, his passive acceptance of bourgeois class attitudes, or his sense of alienation as an artist and an outsider, from full participation in everyday life.\"\nUb Iwerks did a 1934 Cinecolor cartoon based on the story entitled \"The Brave Tin Soldier\". The cartoon's plot is slightly different from the original story. The antagonist is not a Jack-in-the-Box, but rather a toy king who wants the ballerina for himself. The tin soldier attacks the king, and as a result is put on trial and sentenced to death via firing squad. The ballerina pleads for his life to be spared, but her pleas go ignored. She then stands alongside the tin soldier and both are shot into a burning fireplace, where he melts into the shape of a heart with her. The cartoon has a happy ending, as both the tin soldier and ballerina are sent to \"Toy Heaven\", where the tin soldier now has both legs.\n\nGeorge Pal's war-themed 1941 Puppetoon, \"Rhythm in the Ranks\", is likely a loose adaptation of Andersen's story, with a toy soldier getting discharged after falling in love with an ice-skating ballerina.\n\nPaul Grimault (with Jacques Prévert) did a 1947 colour French cartoon \"Le Petit Soldat\" that portrayed the title character as a toy acrobat who is called to war and returns crippled but determined to rescue his ballerina.\n\nMarcia Brown's 1953 picture book illustrating the story in M. R. James's translation was awarded a Caldecott Honor.\n\nIvo Caprino's 1955 puppet movie \"The Steadfast Tin Soldier\".\n\nShawn Phillips's 1964 song 'Little Tin Soldier' is also based on the Hans Christian Andersen tale and was covered by Donovan in 1965.\n\nThe music video of Anastacia's 2005 song Heavy On My Heart was inspired by The Steadfast Tin Soldier, in which it features mannequins in a shop window.\n\nThe Small Faces 1967 song Tin Soldier opens with the lyric \"I am a little tin soldier that wants to jump into your fire\", and appears to have been influenced by the Andersen story.\n\nAndersen's contemporary August Bournonville choreographed the tale for his ballet \"A Fairy Tale in Pictures\", and George Balanchine choreographed the tale in 1975, allowing the soldier and the ballerina to express their love before the ballerina is blown into the fire. Georges Bizet set the tale to music in \"Jeux d'Enfants\".\n\nIn 1976, Soyuzmultfilm made an animated adaptation.\n\nA live action musical adaptation was the second of four episodes of The Enchanted Musical Playhouse that originally aired from 1984 to 1985 on the (then) brand new Disney Channel.\n\nIn 1985, Harmony Gold made an English dub of The Little Train adaptation of the story, the film was originally made in Italy in the late 70s.\n\nIn 1986, Atkinson Film-Arts made an animated adaptation featuring the voices of Rick Jones, Terrence Scammell, and Robert Bockstael, with narration by Christopher Plummer.\n\nIn 1989, Studio Miniatur Filmowych made an animated adaptation.\n\nIn 1991, it was adapted into an animated television movie as part of Timeless Tales from Hallmark which was produced by Hanna-Barbera and Hallmark. It featured the voices of George Newbern as the Tin Soldier, Megan Mullally as the Ballerina, Tim Curry as the Jack-in-the-box and Paul Williams as a frog named Frogbauten. It was Curry's second clown role after he played Pennywise in \"It\" (1990).\n\nChildren's author Tor Seidler adapted the book in 1992, with illustrations by Fred Marcellino.\n\n1995 saw Jon Voight make his directorial debut with \"The Tin Soldier\", a Showtime family film loosely based on Andersen's story.\n\nIn 1996, Vivian Little and Kathleen Mills adapted Anderson's story into a full-length ballet for the Dance Fremont studio in Seattle. The ballet is still produced every winter, as an alternative to the popular Christmas ballet \"The Nutcracker\", which many American studios produce in December. Dance Fremont centers the story around a young deaf boy who receives the toys for Christmas, and uses Signed Exact English for all dialogue.\n\nIn Disney's film \"Fantasia 2000\", an adaptation of the tale is set to the first movement of the Piano Concerto No. 2 in F Major by Dmitri Shostakovich. The segment differs slightly from Andersen's tale: there are only five soldiers, but still only one with one leg; the ballerina appears to be made of porcelain; the soldier is disappointed to discover the ballerina has two legs, but the ballerina still accepts him; at the end, the jack-in-the-box villain is the one that perishes in the fire instead of the soldier and ballerina who both remain in one piece. Other animated films for children have been produced on the tale, and, in 1975, a science fiction fantasy feature film, \"The Tin Soldier\".\nIn Stieg Larsson's 2006 thriller \"The Girl Who Played with Fire\", the fiercely independent protagonist Lisbeth Salander compares the journalist Mikael Blomkvist, who had stayed loyal to her despite her repeated blatant rejection of him, with Andersen's steadfast tin soldier (implicitly comparing herself with Andersen's ballerina).\n\nMike Mignola's graphic novel \"Baltimore, or The Steadfast Tin Soldier and the Vampire\" fuses the poignancy of \"The Steadfast Tin Soldier\" with supernatural Dracula myths, set in a post-World War I environment. Kate DiCamillo's \"The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane\" (2006) makes use of the tale's themes.\n\nThe Hanson song Soldier is also based on this fairy tale. The song doesn't mention the goblin at all. The tin soldier fell out the window when the wind blew and the tin soldier and ballerina melted together while dancing and the ballerina fell near the fireplace.\n\nIn Anirudh Arun's 2013 bildungsroman \"The Steadfast Tin Soldier?\", the protagonist Ashwin is compared to the tin soldier by his successful brother Abhinav (the society thus plays the part of the dangerous jack-in-the-box).\n\nDaft Punk's music video for the song \"Instant Crush\" is said to have been inspired by \"The Steadfast Tin Soldier\".\n\n\n"}

The municipality covers an area of , and has a total population of 48,989 (1 December 2017). Its mayor is Martin Damm, a member of Venstre. The main town and the site of its municipal council is the city of Kalundborg.\n\nThe municipality is surrounded by water on three sides: \n\nThe municipalities of Samsø to the northwest, and Juelsminde on the Jutland peninsula to the west are thus also Kalundborg's municipal neighbors, albeit separated by water.\n\nFerry lines connect the municipality to Aarhus on the Jutland peninsula, and to the island of Samsø at the central harbour in Kalundborg. The harbour is conveniently located near the Kalundborg train station, which connects to the cities of Holbæk and Copenhagen. A large industrial zone, including a South Harbour?, is located south of the town's central area.\n\nOn January 1, 2007 Kalundborg municipality was, as the result of \"Kommunalreformen\" (\"The Municipal Reform\" of 2007), merged with existing Gørlev, Hvidebæk, Bjergsted, and Høng municipalities to form the new Kalundborg municipality.\n\nThe ten largest urban areas in the municipality are:\nKalundborg's municipal council consists of 27 members, elected every four years. \n\nBelow are the municipal councils elected since the Municipal Reform of 2007.\n\nThe tip of \"Røsnæs\" peninsula is the westernmost point on the island of Zealand. On the northern side of the peninsula is the Skanse Forest (\"Skanseskoven\") which has a rich birdlife. During the spring and autumn it is visited by many migrating birds.\n\nStately Lerchenborg Castle, the traditional seat of the aristocratic Lerche family, is located on the forest-covered \"Asnæs\" peninsula. It is one of the finest examples of baroque architecture in Denmark. The home and gardens are open to the public, but is closed during 2005 for restoration. A number of special arrangements take place at the castle during the year, including a Christmas market, music concerts and car shows. The castle was built in 1747 by General Lerche-Lerchenborg. In the southern side wing is a room dedicated to Hans Christian Andersen who was guest in 1862.\n\nThe municipality also encompasses a large body of water near its northern coast— Saltbæk Cove (\"Saltbæk Vig\"), which is one of the largest lakes in West Zealand and a bird reservation. Nearby to the south is a public beach.\n\nOur Lady Church (\"Vor Frue Kirke\"), erected ca. 1170, is located in the center of Kalundborg city's old quarter called \"Højbyen\" (\"The High City\"). It is a beautiful and unique, five-spired church which is believed to have been built by Esbern Snare. It is closely associated with King Valdemar I and the famous Archbishop Absalon. \nThe city center has cobblestone streets, narrow streets, and well-preserved half-timbered houses from the Middle Ages.\n\n"}

Most of the area is in the San Isabel and Gunnison National Forests, with a smaller area in the White River National Forest southeast of Aspen. Most of the area is in northwest Chaffee County with smaller portions in Gunnison, Pitkin, and Lake counties.\n\nThe Collegiate Peaks area includes much of the Sawatch Range and has the highest average elevation of any wilderness area in the United States. Five of the area's peaks are named for famous universities and colleges, including Mt. Harvard, Mt. Oxford, Mt. Yale, Mt. Princeton and Mt. Columbia. These peaks are the source of the name for the wilderness area, which includes them all but Mt. Princeton. Other fourteeners in the area include La Plata Peak, Mount Belford, Huron Peak, and Missouri Mountain. The Collegiate Peaks also includes several notable peaks including the Three Apostles, a chain of three mountains about six miles (10 km) south of the ghost town of Winfield. The middle peak of the Three Apostles is also referred to as Ice Mountain and is generally recognized as one of the most difficult peaks to climb in the Sawatch Range. Notably, the Collegiate Peaks also has two peaks named Grizzly Peak. One is south of Independence Pass at 13,988, and the other is north of Taylor Reservoir on the Continental Divide at 13,281.\n\nThe area is an important watershed for three rivers on both sides of the Continental Divide: the upper Arkansas River, the Gunnison River, and the Roaring Fork River. There are numerous alpine creeks in the area's wide valleys and these are all quite marshy. Snow does not usually begin to melt until May or June and it remains year-round in places on some of the high peaks.\n\nBoth the Continental Divide Trail and the Colorado Trail cross the area. The Continental Divide Trail follows the course of the Continental Divide itself with several side spurs. The Colorado Trail passes through the lower eastern portion of the area and crosses Pine Creek, Frenchman Creek and Three Elk Creek all of which drain into the Arkansas River north of Buena Vista.\n\nIn earlier times the area was inhabited by various people. There are groves of old growth Ponderosa Pine on the eastern side which bear evidence of stripping by bands of native Utes who inhabited the area and used the bark from living trees for clothing and food. The area is also dotted with the evidence of mining operations from the last century. In the Pine Creek valley - one of the central valleys between Mounts Oxford, Belford and Missouri to the north and Mt. Harvard and Columbia to the south, there is evidence of an earlier settlement on both sides of the stream comprising four cabins and a horse corral. South of the town of Winfield are the spare remains of the town of Harrison at the base of Mt. Huron.\n\nThe Collegiate Peaks borders several other Colorado wilderness areas including: Buffalo Peaks, Maroon Bells-Snowmass, Hunter-Fryingpan, and Mount Massive. It was designated by congress as a wilderness area in 1980 in accordance with the provisions of the Wilderness Act of 1964.\n"}

However, it ran into production hassles and is yet to be released.\n\nKhan had a special appearance as an unfaithful fiancé in the 2010 Ranbir Kapoor–Priyanka Chopra starrer, \"Anjaana Anjaani\".\n\nIn 2011, the actor ventured into production with his co-owned production house, Born Free Entertainment along with friend and actress Dia Mirza and her husband, Sahil Sanga. Their first film, \"Love Breakups Zindagi\", was released on 7 October 2011, and was met with a lukewarm response.\n\nIn 2012, Khan played a supporting role in \"Tezz\", which stars Anil Kapoor and Ajay Devgan in the lead. His next film, Ameesha Patel's maiden production, \"Desi Magic\", was slated to release on 28 February 2015.\n\nIn August 2017, Khan made his television debut on a show called \"Haasil\" playing the lead role of Ranvir Raichand opposite Vatsal Sheth and Nikita Dutta. The show premiered on October 2017.\n\nKhan married his high school sweetheart Malaika Parekh on 20 November 2005. In an interview, Malaika stated that Zayed proposed four times to Malaika and she has four rings from him. They both studied in Kodaikanal International School and became acquainted with each other in 1995.\n\nMalaika Parekh born on 23 August 1980 in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. Her mother, Chris Parekh, is English. Malaika is trained in the gems and jewellery business as her late father Rohit Parekh, a diamond merchant, was in the same trade.\n\nIn September 2007, Malaika and Zayed announced that they were expecting their first child. The couple had a baby boy, Zidaan, born 18 January 2008, and a second son, Aariz, born 22 September 2011.\n\nIn 2008, Khan gave up smoking in honour of his first son.\n"}

These properties allow precedence relations to be\ndefined between the terminals of the grammar. A parser that exploits these relations is considerably simpler than more general-purpose parsers such as LALR parsers. Operator-precedence parsers can be constructed for a large class of context-free grammars.\n\nOperator precedence grammars rely on the following three precedence relations between the terminals:\n\nThese operator precedence relations allow to delimit the handles\nin the right sentential forms: formula_1 marks the left end, formula_2 appears in\nthe interior of the handle, and formula_3 marks the right end. Contrary to other shift-reduce\nparsers, all nonterminals are considered equal for the purpose of identifying\nhandles.\nThe relations do not have the same properties as their un-dotted counterparts;\ne. g. formula_4 does not generally imply formula_5, and formula_6 does not follow\nfrom formula_7. Furthermore, formula_8 does not generally hold, and formula_9 is possible.\n\nLet us assume that between the terminals and there is\nalways exactly one precedence relation. Suppose that $ is the end of the string.\nThen for all terminals we define: formula_10 and formula_11. If we\nremove all nonterminals and place the correct precedence relation:\nformula_1, formula_2, formula_3 between the remaining terminals, there remain strings\nthat can be analyzed by an easily developed bottom-up parser.\n\nFor example, the following operator precedence relations can\nbe introduced for simple expressions:\n\nThey follow from the following facts:\n\nThe input string\nafter adding end markers and inserting precedence relations becomes\n\nHaving precedence relations allows to identify handles as follows:\n\n\nIt is generally not necessary to scan the entire sentential form to find the handle.\n\n Initialize: Set ip to point to the first symbol of w$\n\nAn operator precedence parser usually does not store the precedence\ntable with the relations, which can get rather large.\nInstead, precedence functions \"f\" and \"g\" are defined.\nThey map terminal symbols to integers, and so the precedence relations\nbetween the symbols are implemented by numerical comparison:\n\nNot every table of precedence relations has precedence functions,\nbut in practice for most grammars such functions can be\ndesigned.\n\n\nConsider the following table (repeated from above):\n\nUsing the algorithm leads to the following graph:\n\nfrom which we extract the following precedence functions from the maximum heights in the directed acyclic graph:\n\nThe class of languages described by operator-precedence grammars, i.e., operator-precedence languages, is strictly contained in the class of deterministic context-free languages, and strictly contains visibly pushdown languages.\n\nOperator-precedence languages enjoy many closure properties: union, intersection, complementation, concatenation, and they are the largest known class closed under all these operations and for which the emptiness problem is decidable. Another peculiar feature of operator-precedence languages is their local parsability, that enables efficient parallel parsing.\n\nThere are also characterizations based on an equivalent form of automata and monadic second-order logic.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2012158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2012158", "title": "Aerobic conditioning", "text": "Aerobic conditioning\n\nAerobic conditioning is a process whereby the heart and lungs are trained to pump blood more efficiently, allowing more oxygen to be delivered to muscles and organs.\n\nAerobic conditioning is the use of continuous, rhythmic movement of large muscle groups to strengthen the heart and lungs (cardiovascular system). Improvement in aerobic conditioning occurs when athletes expose themselves to an increase in oxygen uptake and metabolism, but to keep this level of aerobic conditioning, the athletes must keep or progressively increase their training to increase their aerobic conditioning.\n\nAerobic condition is usually achieved through cardiovascular exercise such as running, swimming, aerobics, etc. A stronger heart does not pump more blood by beating faster but by beating more efficiently. Trained endurance athletes can have resting heart rates as low as the reported 28 beats per minute in people such as Miguel Indurain or 32 beats per minute of Lance Armstrong, both of whom were professional cyclists at the highest level.\n\nAerobic conditioning trains the heart to be more effective at pumping blood around the body, it does this in a multitude of ways:\n\nAerobic conditioning has the ability to raise a person's maximum oxygen intake, meaning that they are able to diffuse more oxygen into their blood than they previously could.\n\nAlthough exercising at lower intensities will improve aerobic conditioning, the most rapid gains are made when exercising close to an individual's anaerobic threshold. This is the intensity at which the heart and lungs can no longer provide adequate oxygen to the working muscles and an oxygen debt begins to accrue; at this point the exercise becomes anaerobic. Anaerobic training intensity for most individuals will be <85-92% of maximum heart rate.\n\nOnce improvement in aerobic conditioning is apparent, for example in metabolism and oxygen uptake, the body will progressively adapt to further training. Aerobic conditioning can be anywhere from walking on the treadmill to mowing the lawn. The average healthy person should engage in 150–200 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise every week. This amount of physical activity should help with maintaining a healthy weight and keeping the cardiovascular system in good condition.\n\nAerobic conditioning has many advantages over anaerobic as it can increase physical endurance and lifespan. During aerobic training, the aim is to improve the blood flow to the lungs, heart, and blood vessels. This particular type of training targets large muscle groups so that as the intensity of physical activity is increased, overall fitness is improved. There are many benefits to aerobic training, and the outcomes can be very rewarding. Aerobic conditioning can increase the duration that one can endure physical activity. This type of conditioning can help with heart disease, diabetes, or anxiety. Aerobic conditioning also has many non-medical benefits, such as improving mood, alleviating fatigue and stabilizing sleeping patterns. This overall type of conditioning has the most longevity to its practice and can improve a person's health and general well being immensely.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2012159", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2012159", "title": "Waiapu River", "text": "Waiapu River\n\nThe Waiapu River is a river in the Gisborne District of the North Island of New Zealand, with a total length of approximately . Found in the north-east of the Waiapu Valley, it flows north-east from the joining of the Mata River and the Tapuaeroa River (both of which flow from the Raukumara Ranges), then passes by Ruatoria before reaching the Pacific Ocean at Rangitukia. Other tributaries of the Waiapu River include the Mangaoporo, Poroporo, Wairoa, Maraehara rivers, and the Paoaruku stream. It is the most well known river in the region, and lies within the rohe (territory) of Ngāti Porou, the largest iwi (extended kinship group or tribe) on the East Coast, and second largest in New Zealand. The area was the site of hostilities during the New Zealand Wars from June to October in 1865, both between Pākehā (New Zealand Europeans) and Māori, and between factions of Ngāti Porou.\n\nThe New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of \"swallowing river\" for .\n\nIn 1840, approximately 80% of the Waiapu River catchment area, covering , was native forest, with a rich array of native flora and fauna. There was a small area to the east of the river covered in coastal forest and scrub due to partial clearance and burning. Between 1890 and 1930 there was large-scale clearing, felling and burning of native forests for pastoralism. Floods and heavy rainfall are common to the area, and this, combined with the development, resulted in widespread erosion and large amounts of sediment being deposited in the river. This has changed the landscape significantly.\n\nSince the late 1960s, much work has been done to repair the area by planting exotic forests in eroding areas, and encouraging the return of native scrub. However, by 2002 the Waiapu catchment area had few natural habitats remaining. It was 26% exotic \"Pinus radiata\" forest, 37% pasture, 21% native forest, and about 12% kānuka and mānuka scrub. It was highly degraded and modified, and had extensive and serious erosion problems. About half of the pasture area could be considered erosion-prone and unsustainable. Many of the catchment's rivers were full of sediment, and classed as highly degraded. The river had one of the highest sediment yields in the world (20,520 t/km/year in 2000), more than two and a half times that of the adjacent catchment area of the Waipaoa River. Anecdotal evidence suggests that this sediment may have adversely affected nearby coastal and marine environments.\n\nApproximately one sixth of the annual sediment flow in all New Zealand river systems is in the Waiapu River, which continues to be one of the most sediment laden rivers in the world. The annual suspended sediment load is 36 million tonnes, and of sediment flows into the sea every second. The water quality of the river's tributaries is often much higher, as they are closer to the native vegetation cover of the Raukumara Ranges.\n\nIn lower areas, much of the eroded gravel from the catchment area settles on the Waiapu riverbed, making it rise rapidly. The riverbed rose between 1986 and 2007, and a number of bridges over Waiapu's tributaries have had to be raised to accommodate their rising riverbeds. As the riverbed rises, so does the river, which is causing extensive riverbank erosion. The banks eroded at a rate of per year between 1988 and 1997. By the 2003 to 2008 period this rate had doubled, with per year eroding in 2005 and 2006. This erosion threatens the town of Ruatoria, and groynes have been installed in an attempt to divert the river away from the town.\n\nMāori settlement of the Waiapu Valley, surrounding the Waiapu River, was widespread until the 1880s. The river and valley are within the rohe (territory) of Ngāti Porou, and is of immense cultural, spiritual, economic, and traditional value to them. According to traditional beliefs, Ngāti Porou have had an undisturbed relationship with the river since the time of Māui, and the river serves to unite those who live on either side of it. The valley, which they call Te Riu o Waiapu, was a place where they could live, offering safe refuge during periods of war, and supplies of fresh water and various species of fish. In 1840, Ngāti Porou extensively cultivated the area around the river. The significance of the river is expressed in the following whakataukī or pepeha (sayings or proverbs):\n\nKo Hikurangi te maunga, Ko Waiapu te awa, Ko Ngāti Porou te iwi (Hikurangi the mountain, Waiapu the river, Ngati Porou the people)\n\nHoake tāua ki Waiapu ki tātara e maru ana. (Let us shelter under the thick matted cloak of Waiapu.)\n\nThe first Māori church was built on the banks of the Waiapu river in the 1830s. Whakawhitirā Pā, in which the church was located, was described to Richard Taylor as the largest in the region. Just prior to 1840, the pā had approximately 3,000 inhabitants. Taylor's drawing of the church, done after visiting in April 1839, can be viewed here.\n\nMany Ngāti Porou hapū (subtribes or clans) still live in the area, and the valley has a large number of marae. In 2002, the population was approximately 90% Māori, and traditional culture is still practised in the area — though it has changed significantly in the last 150 years. Since they arrived, the many hapū that live alongside the Waiapu River have been responsible for preserving the mauri (special nature) of the river, and the hapū of the valley act as kaitiakitanga (guardians) of the river and its tributaries. The techniques the iwi use to catch kahawai at the mouth of the river are unique to that river, and are considered sacred.\n\nNgāti Porou believe that taniwha (water spirits or monsters) dwell in and protect the river, in turn protecting the valley and its hapū. Taniwha believed to be in Waiapu River include Kotuwainuku, Kotuwairangi, Ohinewaiapu, and Ngungurutehorowhatu.\n\nAccording to an affidavit of Hapukuniha Te Huakore Karaka, two taniwha were placed in strategic locations in the river to protect the hapū from invading tribes — one near Paoaruku (a locality at ) and one at the Wairoa River (a small creek at ). Karaka said that a bridge was built from Tikitiki to Waiomatatini, to the protest of local Māori who were concerned that it would disturb the taniwha. The night before the bridge was completed, a storm came washing the bridge away — the weather till then had been calm. From then, one person would drown in the river nearly every year. If it did not happen one year, two would drown the next. A local tohunga, George Gage (Hori Te Kou-o-rehua Keeti) was approached to help the situation, and after that there were no similar drownings.\n\nThe deforestation and land development of the area has had a huge negative impact on Māori. In December 2010, Ngāti Porou signed a settlement deal with the New Zealand Government for various grievances, some of which relate to the Waiapu Valley. The settlement included a million financial redress, and the return of sites culturally significant to the iwi totally approximately .\n\nThe high level of sediment in Waiapu River means it is undesirable as a source of drinking water, however local marae and small communities have been known to use the water for domestic purposes on occasion. Farmers also allow livestock to drink directly from small streams flowing into the Waiapu River. There are no consents to take, use or dam water on the river or its tributaries, however a mini-hydro power station is expected to be operating in 2012 on a small stream in the catchment area.\n\nAs very little water is taken from Waiapu River or its tributaries, the Gisborne District Council decided it was not necessary to implement the usual water plan regulating water usage in the district. However, a nationwide focus on freshwater policy means that a water plan for the river will be developed with the guidance of the Gisborne Freshwater Advisory Group. This plan is likely to be completed by 2016, and will cover \"its cultural, recreational, ecological, environmental, amenity and commercial values\".\n\nGravel deposited by the river onto shingle beaches near its mouth is extracted at approximately 12 different sites, predominantly for use on nearby rural and forestry roads.\n\nThe Waitahaia River, which flows into the Waiapu River through the Mata River, is renowned for its brown trout — a European species of fish introduced into New Zealand for fishing in the late 1860s.\n\n\n"}

The last locally-owned radio station in Orange County, New York (and one of the few in the entire Hudson Valley), WTBQ broadcasts on 1110 AM and 93.5 FM, throughout Orange County and Northern New Jersey. The station has a diversified format consisting of news, oldies music, specialty music shows, talk shows, and specialty programming.\n\nLocal media figure Ed Klein brought WTBQ to air July 27, 1969 with studios originally located in the village of Warwick. The call letters come from Klein's young daughter's affection for her teddy bear. Originally, WTBQ had a \"Beautiful Music\" format (dubbed \"The Casual Q\"), in contrast to Top 40 music, which Klein hated. WTBQ also had a strong emphasis on news, both local and national (the station was a Mutual Broadcasting System affiliate in the 1970s before later switching to ABC). In the mid-1970s the station evolved to more of a Middle Of The Road format. By 1978, the station switched to a \"town and country\" format playing half Adult Contemporary songs and half country music.\n\nIn 1982, WTBQ was purchased by Jimmy Sturr, who in 1984 moved the studios to the \"Professional Building\" at 62 North Main Street in nearby Florida, New York. The station moved to more of a Mainstream Adult Contemporary music format but ran Jimmy Sturr's Polka Show once a week on the weekend. After another change in ownership (to George Dacre's \"Goodtime Broadcasting\") later in the 1980s, the station switched to Adult Standards. By the early 1990s, the station had financial problems and went silent on May 8, 1993. In May 1994, the station's current owner Frank \"Smokin'\" Truatt bought the station, returning it to the air on July 1, 1994.\n\nFrom its inception, WTBQ has been strictly an AM \"daytimer\", signing on 15 minutes before dawn and signing off 15 minutes after dusk, with exceptions are made in event of a local news emergency such as a snowstorm. Still, WTBQ became the first station in the Hudson Valley to carry its programs on the internet in 1999; it was also the first area radio station with a website, back in 1995. Beginning in 1997, WTBQ began adding more specialty shows on weekends such as a polka show, classic country music show, NASCAR racing, an Irish program, a diversified music show, among others. By 1999, the station was running mostly specialty shows on weekends and a few during the week. By about 2003, the station began gradually adding more such programming during the week.\n\nOn November 30, 2007, WTBQ moved from the Village of Florida back to Warwick. Ed Klein died on October 18, 2008, at the age of 86. WTBQ celebrated its 40th anniversary with a special ceremony at the station's broadcasting tower where a plaque was placed at the antenna site, honoring Ed Klein for having signed-on the station in 1969. Also, in 2008, WTBQ would add an FM translator station, allowing the station to broadcast 24 hours a day, boosting station listening and sales.\n\nIn June 2012, WTBQ moved to Sanfordville Road. On July 1, 2014, local officials (including State Senator William Larkin and Orange County Executive Steve Neuhaus) honored Frank Truatt's 20 years of independent ownership and giving back to the community. A January 2014 article in The Wall Street Journal honored Frank Truatt for owning one of the last of the real \"community\" radio stations in the New York metro area.\n\nAt 1:30 pm on January 28, 2011, WTBQ switched its FM frequency to 93.5 MHz, after just more than three years at 99.1 MHz. The new translator, W228CG, broadcasts at 250 watts. A considerable upgrade from the previous 19 watts, the coverage area is about 50% larger than on 99.1.\n\nWTBQ became one of the first American AM stations to use an FM translator when it began airing on W256BD on January 25, 2008. The arrangement, made possible by a Special Temporary Authority from the Federal Communications Commission and Digital Radio Broadcasting, allowed WTBQ to broadcast its programs 24 hours a day via an FM antenna located on WTBQ's AM broadcast tower. The new translator also broadcasts from WTBQ's tower, located in the Town of Warwick.\n\nBeginning in April 2019, WTBQ began a simulcast on WGHT AM 1500 in Pompton Lakes, New Jersey.\n\n\n \n"}

{"id": "2012172", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2012172", "title": "Satsvarupa dasa Goswami", "text": "Satsvarupa dasa Goswami\n\nSatsvarupa das Goswami (IAST ', Devanagari: ) (born Stephen Guarino\"' on December 6, 1939) is a senior disciple of Bhaktivedanta Swami, who founded the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), better known in the West as the Hare Krishna movement. Serving as a writer, poet, and artist, Satsvarupa dasa Goswami is the author of Bhaktivedanta Swami's authorized biography,\"Srila Prabhupada-lilamrta\". After Bhaktivedanta Swami's death, Satsvarupa dasa Goswami was one of the eleven disciples selected to become an initiating guru in ISKCON.\nSatsvarupa dasa Goswami, (Sanskrit: ), is one of the first few Westerners ordained by Bhaktivedanta Swami in September 1966. He has been since established as a prolific Vaishnava writer and poet. While traveling, lecturing on Krishna consciousness, and instructing disciples worldwide, he published over hundred books including poems, memoirs, essays, novels, and studies based on the Vaishnava scriptures. In his later years he created hundreds of paintings, drawings, and sculptures that attempt to capture and express his perspective on the culture of Krishna consciousness.\n\n\nHe was born Stephen Guarino, the elder of two children, to Italian Roman Catholic parents in Staten Island, New York.\nHe was educated initially in a public high school nearby and then enrolled in the Brooklyn College, where he underwent an intellectual revolution putting in question his Catholic values. In the college he read Nietzsche and Dostoevsky and associated with students and professors who were religious skeptics.\nIn January 1962 he joined the Navy, where he served for two years on board of U.S.S. Saratoga, a super-carrier. In his introduction to \"With Śrīla Prabhupāda in the Early Days, 1966–1969\" he writes: \"A few months after the death of President Kennedy, I was honorably discharged, and without visiting my parents on Staten Island, I went directly to the Lower East Side. By then, the Lower East Side was, in my mind and in the minds of my friends, the most mystical place in the world.\" \"I certainly didn't think some guru was suddenly going to appear and save me. I was too cynical. Yet I was regularly reading versions of the Bhagavad-gita and the Upanishads. Ironically, one week before the gift shop at 26 Second Avenue changed into Srila Prabhupada's temple, I was standing in that very doorway with a Bhagavad-gita in my back pocket, waiting to meet a friend. Somehow we had chosen 26 Second Avenue as a meeting place. At that time, I had no idea what was about to happen.\"\n\nIn July 1966 he met and accepted a spiritual instruction from A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami who registered ISKCON a month later. Bhaktivedanta Swami soon began assigning him typing tasks which Satsvarupa understood \"to be yoga\". On September 23, 1966 he was ordained and shortly became one of the leading figures of the new Gaudiya Vaishnava movement.\n\nAfter Bhaktivedanta Swami died, he was one of eleven disciples selected to become an initiating guru in ISKCON. Prof. Larry Shinn in his overview of the contemporary state of the Bhaktivedanta Swami's movement confirms this while relating his first meeting with Satsvarupa dasa Goswami:\n\nIn a typical initiation ceremony as a guru of International Society for Krishna Consciousness he would begin with purification using \"achamana\" (holy water) and concludes with a sermon on the importance of chanting of the holy names in the life of a new initiate.\n\nIn addition to periods of being a GBC personal assistant, the brief period between January and July 1974 during which he had the opportunity to act as a personal servant and secretary to the founder of ISKCON, Bhaktivedanta Swami, is noted. During this time his duties included bringing Bhaktivedanta Swami his medicine and toothbrush in the morning, accompanying him on his morning walk, preparing his breakfast and lunch and providing his daily massage. In other words, the tasks were those of a menial servant, while Satsvarupa das Goswami was excited about it. Some note that the first time Satsvarupa gave Bhaktivedanta Swami a massage it was \"an intense spiritual experience\" for him:\n\nOne may understand how the service given to one's guru can be of such a value by seeing it in the ritual religious context. The theme of status difference, enriched with the idea of intimacy, coalesce in this simple pattern of devotee massaging the spiritual master's legs and feet in the cultural models expressed in puja and innumerable other Vaishnava contexts. Satsvarupa took the posture of a menial servant with evident relish. It is also taken as an example of ideal typical model of the guru-disciple relationship as a disciple should always consider him- or herself a menial servant of the spiritual master.\n\nAs a writer he is following a line of teachers or gurus in his religious tradition. In his review Srivatsa Goswami suggests this view with a reference to the \"path of Six Goswamis\": Satsvarupa dasa Goswami's writing represents a contemporary variety from commentaries on scriptures to a free flowing poetry and prose.\nHis writings were translated to over forty languages by the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust and Gita Nagari Press. He was also requested by Bhaktivedanta Book Trust to complete a number of works, started by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami.\n\nOne of widely read and translated of all his books is \"Srila Prabhupada-Lilamrta\". It's a biography of the founder of the Hare Krishna movement, depicting him through different stages of his life. It was written with the help of a large research team for a period of over six years. \"Srila Prabhupada-lilamrta\" is based on material given by interviewers and researchers and is based on a system of ascertaining whether a reported biographical story is authentic. By researching tape recordings of Bhaktivedanta Swami, author provided accurate quotes of his statements wherever possible. In this biographical work he would always look for several reliable witnesses, in addition to the one who is recalling a particular event.\n\nOther biographical works include \"He Lives Forever\" (1978) (lectures on the significance of Bhaktivedanta Swami's death) and five volumes of \"Prabhupada Nectar\" (1983–86) (collection of anecdotes told by Bhaktivedanta Swami's disciples and compiled by Satsvarupa dasa Goswami) and a number of other titles. His memoir \"With Srila Prabhupada in the Early Days\" (1991) covers the early years of 1966–1969, his book \"Life With the Perfect Master\" (1983) describes the seven-month period in 1974, when he served as Bhaktivedanta Swami's personal servant.\n\nBooks included in this category include titles published by Bhaktivedanta Book Trust such as Narada Bhakti Sutra and Mukunda Mala Strotra, both unfinished works of his preceptor, as well as the multi-volume \"A Poor Man Reads the Bhagavatam\" – elaboration on Bhaktivedanta Purports of the Bhagavata Purana. From 1966 to recent years Satsvarupa has been contributing to \"Back to Godhead\" magazine. His articles in the \"Back to Godhead\" often demonstrate variety of legitimate perspectives on different issues and perspectives in spiritual understanding of Gaudiya Vaishnavism.\n\nHis book published in 1975 during Bhaktivedanta Swami's lifetime was \"Readings in Vedic Literature: the Tradition Speaks for Itself\". Bhaktivedanta Swami was appreciative of reviews of the book by the academic circles. In the years to follow Satsvarupa dasa Goswami was supportive of the foundation of Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies and some of his works were published in the \"ISKCON Communications Journal\" (ICJ) and reviewed by the academia in ICJ academic journal. Despite initial anti-cult controversies, the Hare Krishna movement today is viewed by the academics as \"the most genuinely Hindu of all the many Indian movements in the West\".\n\nA number of his books are employing techniques of free-writing. Diaries and the letters collection from Bhaktivedanta Swami are spanning from the very beginning of the movement in 1966 in the West and provide an account of the ISKCON movement from the very first years to present days. Martin Palmer, Director of the \"International Consultancy on Religion, Education and Culture\" and Religious Adviser to World Wide Fund for Nature wrote of his book \"Entering the Life of Prayer\" 'I recommend this book to any who are genuinely wrestling with the implications of faith and with the path of prayer. It deserves to become a spiritual classic.'\n\nA number of his poetical works were published in modern American idiom. He was also published in prominent Haiku magazines, the poetry dedicated to Bhaktivedanta Swami's glorification received positive reviews. His paintings and sculpture have also been reviewed by the Washington Times. His works as a self-taught artist are reflective of the dedication of his life to the \"study of Vedic literature and the teachings of the spiritual tradition\".\n\nSatsvarupa dasa Goswami was a pioneer in the early days of the movement, and is the most senior member of the movement at present. He was appointed as a ritvik(representative) by his perceptor. Satvarupa was also one of the original members appointed as (GBC) Governing Body Commission created by Bhaktivedanta Swami in 1970 to gradually take on the responsibility of the spiritual management duties in ISKCON. Satsvarupa dasa Goswami was selected a trustee in the will of A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami for the management of ISKCON.\n\nAfter ISKCON's incorporation in July 1966 at 26 Second Avenue, Satsvarupa dasa was engaged as A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami's personal typist and ISKCON secretary for the first year. He was one of the few devotees who maintained outside jobs to support the ISKCON temple at the beginning. Later he managed ISKCON Boston, and ISKCON Press which was later registered as Bhaktivedanta Book Trust. After assuming duties of a GBC (Governing Body Commissioner) in 1970, Satsvarupa was asked by Bhaktivedanta Swami to accept the order of sannyasa in 1972. He accepted sannyasa along with other GBC members, all of whom were originally married men, such as Tamala Krishna Goswami and Hridayananda dasa Goswami. At the time A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami awarded him and other followers the title \"Goswami\" with the single line instruction: \"Preach, preach, preach!\" He is sometimes listed among active promoters of ahimsa among other Eastern religious teachers.\n\nMain preaching activities by the means of traveling sankirtana parties were centered in United States. BBT (Bhaktivedanta Book Trust) Library Party headed by him in mid-1970s was active in establishing distribution network mainly to the Universities of the United States, with some members of the team such as Bhakti Tirtha Swami and Suhotra Dasa traveling as far as Eastern Europe.\n\nIn 1974, Satsvarupa dasa Goswami was requested by Bhaktivedanta Swami to join him as traveling GBC servant, replacing previous servant Srutakirti Dasa and travelled as a menial servant around the globe.\n\nFrom the early days of ISKCON, the Back to Godhead was project required a lot of both contribution and supervision. Satsvarupa dasa Goswami was editor in chief and one of the main contributors to this magazine till 1991, when assisted editor Jayadvaita Swami took over as the editor in chief.\n\nIn accordance with ISKCON GBC Governing Body Commission resolutions March 1978 Satsvarupa dasa Goswami along with other eleven Governing Body Commissioners assumed duties and services of initiating disciples in assigned zones after the death of Bhaktivedanta Swami. Initial preaching areas in the United States and Caribbean were expanded with an addition of Ireland in 1982 where he became a zonal acharya. The assumption of equal status to Bhaktivedanta Swami and the title of \"Guru-Acarya\" are still surrounded in a controversy. While following the direction of Governing Body Commission, Satsvarupa dasa Goswami was one of the pioneers who attempted to reform the system, by assuming more humble and appropriate role of a guru as per recorded instructions of the \"Founder-Acarya.\" While imitation of Bhaktivedanta Swami was criticised, despite these warnings, specifically by Satsvarupa dasa Goswami, such imitation sometimes resulted in curious side-effects and many devotees adopted Bhaktivedanta Swami's mannerisms. This remained evident especially among the older American devotees who even now speak with an Indian accent and display many of Bhaktivedanta Swami's gestures like turning one's head or moving one's hand in a certain way.\n\nIn years 1978–1985 he took part in a controversial zonal acarya system in a position of an Acharya while initiating reform of a high standard of worship. In 1986–1987 a number of senior members and newly appointed GBC members with the support of Satsvarupa dasa Goswami reformed ISKCON guru system, lowering unprecedented level of worship reserved to initiating gurus in ISKCON. He was called as the \"most vocal in the cause of reform\" in ISKCON. Satsvarupa dasa Goswami recorded this period in his book \"Guru Reform Notebook\" (1987). Throughout the years that followed, up until the end of the century, new ISKCON guru system was further developed.\n\nIn 1999 Governing Body Commission confirmed GBC Emeritus status of his membership of the Governing Body of ISKCON.\n\nHis extensive traveling in Europe in 1990s included areas of Scandinavia, Eastern, Central Europe and Italy, but mainly centered in preaching in Ireland and UK.\nIn following years, his devotional life has included the creation of hundreds of paintings, drawings, and sculptures that capture and express the artist's vision of Krishna consciousness. His latest literary work is centered on his commentary on Bhagavata Purana known as \"A Poor Man Reads the Bhagavatam\".\n\nIn 2002, he suffered a physical and emotional collapse from chronic migraine headaches, a condition that required immediate medical intervention and treatment. In consultation with the official governing body of the Krishna consciousness society, he agreed to cease initiating disciples. With the GBC consultation, he retained his Goswami title and continued in the sannyasa order and as an ISKCON guru.\n\nFollowing a period of health recovery, at the age of 68, Satsvarupa dasa Goswami took residence in the East Coast United States where he is engaging in a number of preaching activities, such as regular lecturing and traveling to the holy \"dhamas\". All of the associated preaching and traveling is complementing his main service of commenting and answering disciples' questions on the Bhaktivedanta Purports being published as the volumes of \"A Poor Man Reads the Bhagavatam\" and daily online journal.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

His file is still not fully disclosed and will be held until 2025 in the FSB archives. It was not until 1990 that Kuznetsov was officially recognized as a NKVD agent. He used several pseudonyms during his intelligence operations: e.g. Rudolf Schmidt, Nikolai Vasilevitsh Grachev (Николай Васильевич Грачёв) and Oberleutnant Paul Siebert. Kuznetsov was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union.\n\nKuznetsov was born into a peasant family of Russian ethnicity in Perm Governorate (present-day Sverdlovsk Oblast). He studied forestry in a technical school and, after discovering his linguistic talents, learned the German, Esperanto, Polish, Ukrainian and Mordvinic languages (particularly Erzya language). In 1926, at age 15, Kuznetsov enrolled at Tyumen Agricultural College but did not finish and was forced to return home because of the death of his father. During that time Kuznetsov joined the ranks of the Komsomol. At home he enrolled in the local forestry college but in 1929 Kuznetsov was accused of having counter-revolutionary origins and excluded from Komsomol and the college. After moving in 1930 to Kudymkar (Komi-Permyak Autonomous Okrug) Kuznetsov was recruited by the local department of the OGPU. In 1932 he enrolled into Sverdlovsk Industrial Institute and continued to study German and other foreign languages.\n\nIn 1938 Kuznetsov moved to Moscow and joined the NKVD, his tasks included posing as a Volga German and collecting intelligence about German diplomats in Moscow.\n\nAccording to official Soviet version, Kuznetsov was killed in a firefight with members of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army near the city of Brody on March 9, 1944. In another version by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, Kuznetsov and his associates were detained in the village of Boratyn near Brody, dressed as German soldiers. To avoid being discovered, Kuznetsov blew himself up on a grenade.\n\nKuznetsov is currently buried in Lviv, Ukraine. Since 2003 several unsuccessful attempts have been made to rebury him in Russia. An 2007 attempt was stopped by the Russian Foreign Ministry, they claimed that \"such a move would open a kind of Pandora’s box and give Ukrainian nationalists a reason to launch a campaign to transfer other graves of Soviet soldiers buried in Ukraine.\" An 2018 attempt was prevented by the Lviv authorities, who claimed that such a reburial could not be considered while Ukrainian prisoners where being held captive in Russia during an ongoing Russian military intervention in Ukraine.\n\nNikolai Ivanovich Kuznetsov has been posthumously awarded the honorary title of Hero of the Soviet Union. Minor planet 2233 Kuznetsov, discovered in 1972 by Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Zhuravlyova, is named after him. Kuznetsovsk, a city in Volhynia, was named after the Soviet agent (renamed in 2016 to Varash conforming to a law prohibiting names of Communist origin).\n\n\nKuznetzov's main target, Nazi Party official Erich Koch, survived World War II and outlived his Soviet \"nemesis\"; dying of old age in a Polish prison in 1986 at the age of 90.\n\n\nAccording to the Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance Kuznetzov \"carried out provocations against the Ukrainian liberation movement, as a result of which the Nazi invaders executed hostages\".\n\n\n"}

The result is analogous to a 1962 construction used by Kahr, Moore, and Wang, to show that a more constrained version of the domino problem was undecidable.\n\nBerger did his undergraduate studies at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and studied applied physics at Harvard, earning a master's degree, before shifting to applied mathematics for his doctorate.

He currently competes part-time in the NASCAR Gander Outdoors Truck Series, driving the No. 1 Chevrolet Silverado for Beaver Motorsports.\n\nHe was the 2003 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series champion.\n\nKvapil grew up working on cars in his father's garage, and racing was a natural progression for the Wisconsin native. Kvapil began racing in 1992 at the age of 16 at Rockford Speedway, competing in the NASCAR Weekly Racing Series. He went on to win the American Short Tracker division track championship in 1994 at Rockford. In 1995, he moved up to super late models at Madison International Speedway, \"Wisconsin's Fastest Half-Mile\", and was named the track Rookie of the Year. He also became the track's Late Model Champion a year later in 1996. This honor made Kvapil the youngest to ever capture the title at the track at the age of 20.\n\nKvapil moved to the ARTGO Series, a Midwest asphalt short-track motor-racing touring series. He finished in the top-10 in points from 1998–2000.\n\nIn 2001, Kvapil made his debut in the Craftsman Truck Series driving for Addington Racing in the No. 60 CAT Rental Stores-sponsored Chevrolet. In his 21st start, Kvapil won his first Truck Series race in the Silverado 350 at Texas Motor Speedway. Kvapil's eighteen Top 10's led him to finish fourth place in the driver standings and win the Craftsman Truck Series Rookie of the Year. Kvapil also got to drive a race with powerhouse Richard Childress Racing at Kentucky in the Busch Series, but he ran poorly before flipping his car in a late crash.\n\nIn 2002, Kvapil managed to match his win total by winning the O'Reilly Auto Parts 200 at Memphis Motorsports Park. He finished the season with 14 Top 10's and finished ninth in the final driver points standings.\n\nFunding issues at Addington caused Kvapil to switch to the No. 16 IWX MotorFreight-sponsored Chevrolet for Steve Coulter's Xpress Motorsports team in 2003. He won one race during the season at Bristol Motor Speedway in the O'Reilly 200 presented by Valvoline Maxlife. Kvapil finished the season with 22 Top 10's in 25 races (88 percent). Kvapil passed Brendan Gaughan and Ted Musgrave in points at the season finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway. Gaughan wrecked and Musgrave was black flagged during the race, giving the green flag to Kvapil as he was crowned the 2003 Craftsman Truck Series champion. He was recorded at 99.9 percent lap completion rate, only missing one lap throughout the 2003 season.\n\nPrior to the start of the 2004 season, Kvapil began a partnership with Alexander Meshkin to drive the No. 24 Line-X-Benders / eBay Bang!-sponsored Racing Toyota. Kvapil came away with his first win of the season during the Line-X Spray-on Truck Bedliners 200 at Michigan International Speedway. The win gave Toyota their first win in the top-tiers of NASCAR. Two months later, Kvapil won at New Hampshire International Speedway. The same season, Kvapil won his first Bud Pole Award in the Craftsman Truck Series at the American Racing Wheels 200 at California Speedway. He finished eight in the final driver standings of the season.\n\nAt the end of the 2004 season, Kvapil made his first NEXTEL Cup Series start at Martinsville Speedway. Kvapil drove the No. 06 Mobil 1-sponsored Dodge, the fourth car on the track from Penske Racing. He made three additional starts in the No. 06 in preparation for driving Penske Racing's No. 77 in 2005. In 2005, Kvapil took over the Penske's No. 77 Kodak-sponsored Dodge full-time, replacing Brendan Gaughan.\nKvapil scored his first ever Nextel Cup Series top-10 at Brisol Motor Speedway when he finished seventh during the Food City 500. He picked up another Top 10 at Phoenix International Raceway during the Checker Auto Parts 500. These two top-10 finishes pushed Kvapil to finish 33rd in the point standings during his first season in the series. When the season ended, the Penske Racing No. 77 team temporarily disbanded when Kodak pulled out of the sponsorship deal.\n\nAfter his departure from Penske, Kvapil signed with PPI Motorsports for the 2006 NASCAR Sprint Cup season. He drove the No. 32 Tide-sponsored Chevrolet for the 2006 season. He had his best finishes of the season at Kansas Speedway, Pocono Raceway, and Talladega Superspeedway, where he finished 19th in all three of those events. Kvapil finished the season 36th in points, and was forced to find a new ride for the next season as his PPI contract only lasted one year. PPI eventually shut down after the 2006 due to the inability to find a sponsor to replace Tide. The team also did not have a manufacturer commitment for the 2007 NASCAR Sprint Cup season.\n\nIn 2007, Jack Roush, owner of Roush Racing, offered Kvapil a seat in the No. 6 Ford F-150 in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series. Kvapil replaced Mark Martin in the truck, who moved to Ginn Racing, and David Ragan, who was promoted to replace Martin in the No. 6 Ford in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. Jack Roush, excited about signing with Kvapil, said, “We are pleased beyond measure that we were able to get a driver the caliber of Travis Kvapil. At only 30 years old with a Truck championship and two years of Sprint Cup experience under his belt, Travis brings great long and short term potential to and for Roush Racing.” He finished the season with four wins, three poles, eight Top 5s and 12 Top 10s. He finished the season sixth in the driver point standings. He returned to Roush Fenway Racing as a part-time driver in 2008 when Joey Clanton was released from the No. 09 Ford.\n\nRoush recognized Kvapil's talents, and helped return to Cup with Yates Racing in 2008. Kvapil drove the famous No. 28 Yates Ford Fusion. Prior to the start of the season, Kvapil and teammate David Gilliland did not have a full-time sponsorship on their Yates Racing Fords. While Gilliland's team found full-time sponsorship, Kvapil's team had to piece together sponsorship throughout the season. K&N Filters sponsored Kvapil's team for the Daytona 500. Two weeks later, Kvapil scored an eighth-place finish at Las Vegas Motor Speedway during the UAW-Dodge 400. The finish at LVMS, which was in an unsponsored car, gave Kvapil his third Top 10 of his career. After the race, it was announced that Zaxby's would serve as a sponsorship for the No. 28 team in the Kobalt Tools 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway, a race in which he finished 29th. With a one-race sponsorship deal with Northern Tool and Equipment, Kvapil finished sixth in the Aaron's 499 at Talladega. This gave him his career-best finish in the Sprint Cup Series. Kvapil picked up another Top 10 finish in the Dodge Challenger 500 at Darlington. Despite the lack of sponsorship for the year, Kvapil collected another four Top 10 finishes, finishing 23rd in the points standings. He also won the pole at the fall Talladega race, which turned out to be the last pole award for Yates Racing.\n\nIn 2009, Kvapil returned to the No. 28, but the team was forced to close after six races due to lack of funding. Yates Racing ended up shutting down after the season. Kvapil qualified for several drivers through the rest of the year, but did not have a full-time ride.\n\nIn 2010, Kvapil returned to a full-time ride in the Long John Silver's-sponsored Ford for Front Row Motorsports. This car changed numbers throughout the year, using either No. 34, No. 37, or No. 38, depending on each number's position in points (with the goal being to get all three cars in the Top 35 for 2011). In 2011, Kvapil returned to FRM full-time in the No. 38 car, but signed up to compete for the Camping World Truck Series championship with Randy Moss Motorsports in their No. 5 Toyota. After 10 races, however, Kvapil was released in favor of defending Truck champion Todd Bodine, whose Germain Racing team partnered with RMM to continue running that driver for 2011. Kvapil stuck with FRM in the Cup Series, driving their No. 38 for most races, except in several late-season races, J. J. Yeley swapped rides with Kvapil several times, with the latter driving FRM's start and park No. 55.\n\nLeaving FRM after the end of the 2011 season, Kvapil was signed by BK Racing to compete in the Sprint Cup Series for 2012. He drove the No. 93 Toyota starting with the second race of the year at Phoenix with Todd Anderson serving as crew chief; At Darlington, where David Reutimann drove the No. 93, Kvapil drove the No. 73 for BK Racing, though he drove the No. 93 for the remainder of the season. He also drove for RAB Racing in the season-opening Camping World Truck Series event, replacing a suspended John Wes Townley. Kvapil ended the 2012 Cup season 27th in points, his second best finish in the points since his debut.\n\nHowever, in 2013, both Kvapil and BK Racing struggled. Kvapil dropped to 31st in points, recording five Top 20 finishes but nine DNFs (including five blown engines). The team released Kvapil shortly before the start of the 2014 season.\nDuring Speedweeks 2014, Kvapil announced that he had signed to drive in the Sprint Cup Series for Go FAS Racing on a limited basis, as well as for MAKE Motorsports in the Camping World Truck Series. On August 12, it was announced that Kvapil would replace Townley in the No. 05 Athenian Motorsports Toyota for the Truck race at Michigan. Kvapil also ran several late-season races for Circle Sport, tying his best career finish of sixth at Talladega. Also in the fall, he returned to BK racing to run the No. 83 Toyota in several races after the team released rookie Ryan Truex. Kvapil was scheduled to make a qualifying attempt for the 2015 Cup season at Atlanta, driving the No. 44 Chevrolet for Team Xtreme, but was forced to withdraw when his car, hauler and truck were stolen from a hotel parking lot. For 2015, Kvapil mostly raced in the truck series driving the No. 1 Chevrolet for MAKE Motorsports.\n\nIn 2016, Kvapil announced that he would run the full Camping World Truck Series season with MAKE Motorsports once again. In the season opener at Daytona, Kvapil scored a fifth-place finish. He also made his return to the Xfinity Series, driving the No. 15 Ford for B. J. McLeod Motorsports at Richmond and Talladega.\n\nKvapil continued to drive the No. 50 truck for MAKE, now known as Beaver Motorsports, in 2017.\n\nKvapil is married to his wife Jennifer, and has three children: Kelsey, Carson and Caden. The Kvapils reside in Mooresville, North Carolina.\n\nKvapil competed against fellow Wisconsin native Matt Kenseth at Madison International Speedway. Kvapil, like Kenseth, is an avid Green Bay Packers fan. During the 2006 NASCAR Nextel Cup season, Kvapil and his No. 32 Tide from PPI Motorsports appeared on an episode of \"Guiding Light\".\n\nOn October 8, 2013, Kvapil was arrested by the Mooresville police department following a domestic dispute. Kvapil was charged with assault on a female and false imprisonment, and was released on $1,000 bail. Kvapil was allowed to race in that weekend's Bank of America 500 at Charlotte Motor Speedway. On January 30, 2014, it was announced that Kvapil had accepted a plea deal in the case, pleading guilty in exchange for having the case dismissed following two years' probation, community service, and attending an anger management class.\n\n Season still in progress<br>\n\n"}

Most of the actors were non-professional, including Carlo Battisti who plays the title role of Umberto Domenico Ferrari, a poor elderly man in Rome who is desperately trying to keep his rented room. His landlady (Lina Gennari) is evicting him, and his only true friends, the housemaid (Maria-Pia Casilio) and his dog Flike (called 'Flag' in some subtitled versions of the film) are of no help.\n\nAccording to Robert Osborne of Turner Classic Movies, this was De Sica's favorite of all his films. The movie was included in \"TIME\" magazine's \"All-TIME 100 Movies\" in 2005. The film's sets were designed by Virgilio Marchi.\n\nPolice disperse an organized street demonstration of elderly men demanding a raise in their meager pensions. One of the marchers is Umberto D. Ferrari, a retired government worker.\n\nHe returns to his room, and finds that his landlady has rented it out for an hour to an amorous couple. She threatens to evict Ferrari at the end of the month if he cannot pay the overdue rent: fifteen thousand lire. He sells a watch and some books, but only raises a third of the amount. The landlady refuses to accept partial payment.\n\nMeanwhile, the sympathetic maid confides in Umberto that she has her own problems. She is three months pregnant, but is unsure which of two soldiers is the father, the tall one from Naples or the short one from Florence.\n\nFeeling ill, Umberto gets himself admitted to a hospital; it turns out to be tonsillitis, and he is discharged after a few days. When he returns to the apartment, he finds workmen renovating the entire place. The landlady is getting married. Umberto's room has a gaping hole in the wall; the maid tells him it is to become part of an enlarged living room. The maid was taking care of his dog, Flike, but a door was left open and Flike ran away.\n\nUmberto rushes to the city pound, and is relieved to find his dog. However, when he makes a veiled plea for a loan to one of his friends who has a job, the friend refuses to listen. Unable to bring himself to beg from strangers on the street, Umberto contemplates suicide, but knows he must first see that Flike is taken care of. He packs his belongings, and leaves the apartment. His parting advice to the maid is to get rid of the boyfriend from Florence.\n\nUmberto attempts to find a place for Flike, first with a couple who board dogs, then a little girl he knows, but the latter's nanny makes her give the dog back. Flike goes to play with some children, and Umberto slips away, gambling that one of them will adopt him. Despite Umberto's attempt to abandon Flike, the dog finds him hiding under a footbridge. Finally in desperation, Umberto takes the dog in his arms and walks on to a railway track as a speeding train approaches. Flike becomes frightened, wriggles free and flees. Umberto runs after him. At first Flike warily hides, but eventually Umberto coaxes Flike out to play with a pine cone. Still homeless and nearly penniless, Umberto scampers down the park lane with his dog.\n\n\nDe Sica said that the film was quite unpopular in Italy because it was in a period after WWII when the country was just getting back on its feet. Subsequently, they saw Umberto D. as too critical of the pride they were trying to engender in themselves. It was, however, quite popular overseas and the film he remained most proud of (even dedicating the film to his father).\n\nIn an interview where he discussed \"Diary of a Country Priest\", \"Psycho\" and \"Citizen Kane\", Ingmar Bergman is quoted as saying, \"Umberto D. is... a movie I have seen a hundred times, that I may love most of all.\"\n\nRoger Ebert included the film in his selection of Great Movies, writing \"Vittorio De Sica's \"Umberto D\" (1952) is the story of the old man's struggle to keep from falling from poverty into shame. It may be the best of the Italian neorealist films--the one that is most simply itself, and does not reach for its effects or strain to make its message clear.\"\n\n\nA French remake entitled \"A Man and His Dog\" premiered in 2008. The film was directed by Francis Huster, co-written by Huster and Murielle Magellan, and stars Jean-Paul Belmondo in his first role in seven years, alongside Hafsia Herzi, Julika Jenkins and Francis Huster among others.\n\n"}

Thousands of devotees visit it every day.\n\nThe original temple of Lord Rama was very old, estimated to be of the Rashtrakuta Period from 7th to 11th centuries. However ,antiquity of the Rama idol threw light on the fact that it was more 2000 years.The original temple was destroyed was greatly destroyed by Muslim rulers and it remained in demolished condition. However, during the first Islamic attack on the Temple, the idol of Lord was thrown in the Godavari River by the Temple Brahmins in order to save it.The new temple was funded by Sardar Rangarao Odhekar, and was rebuilt around 1788.Once , Odhekar had a dream that the statue of Rama in black colour was in the Godavari River.He carried out expedition of reviving the idol and miraculously got it. Odhekar took the statue from river and built the temple.Odhekar's expedition is an important part of Nashik's history. There is a statue of Sardar Odhekar in the temple. \n\nAccording to ancient epic of the Ramayana, Lord Rama was sent in exile for fourteen years. After the tenth year of exile, Lord Rama along with Lakshman and Seeta, lived for two and half years on the northern bank of the Godavari near Nasik. This place is known as Panchavati.\n\nThe temple formed a pivotal role in the Dalit movement in India. B. R. Ambedkar led a protest outside the temple on 2 March 1930, in order to allow Dalits into the temple.\n\n1) The main entrance has a Lord Hanuman deity which is black. There is also a very old tree that has Lord Dattatreya's footprint impressions marked on a stone. Pilgrims visit the Kapaleshwar Mahadev temple near the Kalaram Temple.\n\n2) Lord Hanuman's temple is designed in such a way that, Lord Ram's idol can be visible from Lord Hanuman's idol.\n\n3) Main temple of Ram has 14 steps, which represents 14 years of Ram's exile.\n\n4) Also, the temple has 84 pillars, which represents cycle of 84 lakh species one has to go in order to get Human birth.\n"}

Inspired by Bernard Pivot's French literary programme \"Apostrophes\", the series featured interviews with prize-winning authors and journalists, and examined the latest trends in books and contemporary issues in literature.\n\nThe series premiered in September 1989, hosted by Paul Roberts and Jennifer Gibson in its first season. The show was so poorly received at first that the network placed the show on temporary hiatus after only a few episodes, revamping its production team before relaunching it in November. The change did not improve the program's critical reviews, however, with Roberts in particular being singled out for shying away from potentially controversial discussions.\n\nBoth hosts left the series in 1990, and Daniel Richler took over as host in the second season. Under Richler, the show expanded its format to include a rotating stable of contributing interviewers, including journalist Ann Medina, critic and writer Gary Michael Dault, novelists M. T. Kelly and Barbara Gowdy, poet Clifton Joseph and biographer Michael Coren, as well as regular round table discussions on literary topics. The new format significantly improved the program's critical reception.\n\nRichler left the series in 1993, and was succeeded by Guy Lawson. Ken Rockburn, fresh off the cancellation of his syndicated radio series \"Medium Rare\", was also a finalist for the job.\n\nLawson left the show in 1995 to return to writing full-time, and was succeeded that fall by H. S. Bhabra and Marni Jackson.\n\nIn 1996, due to budget cuts at TVOntario the show was slated to have its staff and format cut back, although at this time CBC Newsworld stepped in as a coproducer. A third cohost, Cynthia Macdonald, was added in the 1996 season.\n\nJackson and Bhabra left the show in 1997, and were succeeded by Mary Hynes as sole host. CBC Newsworld did not continue to air the show in the 1997-98 season, instead introducing its own show on books and literature, \"Hot Type\". Hynes hosted until 2000, when she returned to CBC Radio, and was succeeded by Tina Srebotnjak. When BookTelevision launched in 2001, \"Imprint\" was added to its schedule.\n\nTVOntario, the program's producer, cancelled the series in early 2005.\n\n\"One on One: The Imprint Interviews\", a compilation book of author interviews from the series, was published in 1994.\n"}

{"id": "2012209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2012209", "title": "Cognitive apprenticeship", "text": "Cognitive apprenticeship\n\nCognitive apprenticeship is a theory that emphasizes the importance of the process in which a master of a skill teaches that skill to an apprentice.\n\nConstructivist approaches to human learning have led to the development of the theory of cognitive apprenticeship. This theory accounts for the problem that masters of a skill often fail to take into account the implicit processes involved in carrying out complex skills when they are teaching novices. To combat these tendencies, cognitive apprenticeships \"…are designed, among other things, to bring these tacit processes into the open, where students can observe, enact, and practice them with help from the teacher…\". This model is supported by Albert Bandura's (1997) theory of modeling, which posits that in order for modeling to be successful, the learner must be attentive, access and retain the information presented, be motivated to learn, and be able to accurately reproduce the desired skill.\n\nPart of the effectiveness of the cognitive apprenticeship model comes from learning in context and is based on theories of situated cognition. Cognitive scientists maintain that the context in which learning takes place is critical (e.g., Godden & Baddeley, 1975). Based on findings such as these, Collins, Duguid, and Brown (1989) argue that cognitive apprenticeships are less effective when skills and concepts are taught independently of their real-world context and situation. As they state, \"Situations might be said to co-produce knowledge through activity. Learning and cognition, it is now possible to argue, are fundamentally situated\". In cognitive apprenticeships, teachers model their skills in real-world situations.\n\nBy modelling and coaching, masters in cognitive apprenticeships also support the three stages of skill acquisition described in the expertise literature: the cognitive stage, the associative stage, and the stage. In the cognitive stage, learners develop a declarative understanding of the skill. In the associative stage, mistakes and misinterpretations learned in the cognitive stage are detected and eliminated, while associations between the critical elements involved in the skill are strengthened. Finally, in the autonomous stage, the learner's skill becomes honed and perfected until it is executed at an expert level.\n\nLike traditional apprenticeships, in which the apprentice learns a trade such as tailoring or woodworking by working under a master teacher, cognitive apprenticeships allow masters to model behaviors in a real-world context with cognitive modeling. After listening to the master explain exactly what they are doing and thinking as they model the skill, the apprentice identifies relevant behaviors and develops a conceptual model of the processes involved. The apprentice then attempts to imitate those behaviors as the master observes and coaches. Coaching provides assistance at the most critical level– the skill level just beyond what the learner/apprentice could accomplish by themself. Vygotsky (1978) referred to this as the Zone of Proximal Development and believed that fostering development within this zone would lead to the most rapid development. The coaching process includes providing additional modeling as necessary, giving corrective feedback, and giving reminders, which all intend to bring the apprentice's performance closer to that of the master's. As the apprentice becomes more skilled through the repetition of this process, the feedback and instruction provided by the master \"fades\" until the apprentice is, ideally, performing the skill at a close approximation of the master level.\n\nCollins, Brown, and Newman developed six teaching methods rooted in cognitive apprenticeship theory and claim these methods help students attain cognitive and metacognitive strategies for \"using, managing, and discovering knowledge\". The first three, modeling, coaching, scaffolding, are at the core of cognitive apprenticeship and help with cognitive and metacognitive development. The next two, articulation and reflection, are designed to help novices with awareness of problem-solving strategies and execution similar to that of an expert. The final step, exploration, intends to guide the novice towards independence and the ability to solve and identify problems within the domain on their own. The authors note, however, that this is not an exhaustive list of methods and that the successful execution of these methods is highly dependent on the domain.\n\nModeling is when an expert, usually a teacher, within the cognitive domain or subject area demonstrates a task explicitly so that novices, usually a student, can experience and build a conceptual model of the task at hand. For example, a math teacher might write out explicit steps and work through a problem aloud, demonstrating their heuristics and procedural knowledge. Modeling includes demonstrating expert performances or processes in the world.\n\nCoaching involves observing a novice's task performance and offering feedback and hints to sculpt the novice's performance to that of an expert's. The expert oversees the novice's tasks and may structure the task accordingly to assist the novice's development.\n\nInstructional scaffolding is the act of applying strategies and methods to support the student's learning. These supports could be teaching manipulatives, activities, or group work. The teacher may have to execute parts of the task that the student is not yet able to do. This requires the teacher to have the skill to analyze and assess students' abilities in the moment.\n\nArticulation includes \"any method of getting students to articulate their knowledge, reasoning, or problem-solving process in a domain\" (p. 482). Three types of articulation are inquiry teaching, thinking aloud, and critical student role. Through inquiry teaching (Collins & Stevens, 1982), teachers ask students a series of questions that allow them to refine and restate their learned knowledge and form explicit conceptual models. Thinking aloud requires students to articulate their thoughts while solving problems. Students assuming a critical role monitor others in cooperative activities and draw conclusions based on the problem-solving activities. Articulation is described by McLellan as consisting of two aspects: separating component knowledge from skills to learn more effectively, and more commonly verbalizing or demonstrating knowledge and thinking processes in order to expose and clarify ideas.\n\nReflection allows students to \"compare their own problem-solving processes with those of an expert, another student, and ultimately, an internal cognitive model of expertise\" (p. 483). A technique for reflection would be examining the past performances of both an expert and a novice, and highlighting similarities and differences. The goal of reflection is for students to look back and analyze their performances with desire to understand and improve the behavior of an expert.\n\nExploration involves giving students room to problem solve on their own and teaching students exploration strategies. The former requires the teacher to slowly withdraw the use of supports and scaffolds not only in problem solving methods, but problem setting methods as well. The latter requires the teacher to show students how to explore, research, and develop hypotheses. Exploration allows the student to frame interesting problems within the domain for themselves and then take the initiative to solve these problems.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2012210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2012210", "title": "Louis Adamic", "text": "Louis Adamic\n\nLouis Adamic () (23 March 1898 – 4 September 1951) was a Slovene-American author and translator, mostly known for writing about and advocating for ethnic diversity of America.\n\nAlojz Adamič was born at Praproče Mansion in Praproče pri Grosupljem in the region of Lower Carniola, in what is now Slovenia (then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire). The oldest son of a peasant family, he was given a limited childhood education at the city school and, in 1909, entered the primary school at Ljubljana. Early in his third year he joined a secret students' political club associated with the Yugoslav Nationalistic Movement that had recently sprung up in the South-Slavic provinces of Austria-Hungary.\n\nSwept up in a bloody demonstration in November 1913, Adamic was briefly jailed, expelled from school, and barred from any government educational institution. He was admitted to the Jesuit school in Ljubljana, but was unable to bring himself to go. \"No more school for me. I was going to America,\" Adamic wrote. \"I did not know how, but I knew that I would go.\"\n\nOn 31 December 1913, at the age of 15, Adamič emigrated to the United States.\n\nHe finally settled in a heavily ethnic Croatian fishing community of San Pedro, California. He became a naturalized United States citizen in 1918 as Louis Adamic. He worked as a manual laborer and later at a Yugoslavian daily newspaper, \"Narodni Glas\" (\"The Voice of the Nation\"), that was published in New York. As an American soldier he participated in combat on the Western front during the First World War. After the war he worked as a journalist and professional writer.\n\nAll of Adamic's writings are based on his labor experiences in America and his former life in Slovenia. He achieved national acclaim in America in 1934 with his book \"The Native's Return\", which was a bestseller directed against King Alexander's regime in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. This book gave many Americans their first real knowledge of the Balkans. It contained many insights, but proved far from infallible: Adamic predicted that America would prosper by eventually \"going left\", i.e. turning socialist.\n\nHe received the Guggenheim Fellowship award in 1932. During the Second World War he had supported the Yugoslav National liberation struggle and the establishment of a socialist Yugoslav federation. He founded the United Committee of South-Slavic Americans in support of Marshal Tito. From 1949 he was a corresponding member of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts. \n\nFrom 1940 onwards he served as editor of the magazine \"Common Ground\". Adamic was the author of \"Dynamite: The Story of Class Violence in America\" (1931); \"Laughing in the Jungle: The Autobiography of an Immigrant in America\" (1932); \"The Native's Return: An American Immigrant Visits Yugoslavia and Discovers His Old Country\" (1934); \"Grandsons: A Story of American Lives\" (1935, novel); \"Cradle of Life: The Story of One Man's Beginnings\" (1936, novel); \"The House in Antigua\" (1937, travel); \"My America\" (1938); \"From Many Lands\" (1940); \"Two-Way Passage\" (1941); \"What's Your Name?\" (1942); \"My Native Land\" (1943); \"Nation of Nations\" (1945); and \"The Eagle and the Root\" (1950). Maxim Lieber was his literary agent, 1930–1931 and in 1946. In 1941, Adamic won the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award for \"From Many Lands\".\n\nAdamic was strongly opposed to the foreign policy followed by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and in 1946 wrote \"Dinner at the White House\" which purported to be an account of a dinner party given by President Franklin D. Roosevelt at which Adamic and Churchill had both been present. After the proofs had been passed by publishers Harper and Brothers, an additional footnote was inserted in pages 151 and 152 which claimed that Churchill had opposed the National Liberation Front in Greece because they intended to scale down the rate of interest Greece was paying to Hambros Bank. The footnote further claimed that Hambros had \"bailed Winston Churchill out of bankruptcy in 1912\".\n\nThe footnote appeared in the book when it was published, and a copy was circulated to every British Member of Parliament; when Churchill was alerted, he instructed his solicitors to issue a writ for libel. Harper and Brothers admitted the statement was untrue and Adamic also withdrew the claim and apologised; a substantial sum of damages was paid, reported by the \"Daily Express\" as £5,000. the copy of \"Dinner at the White House\" in the British Library is held in the 'Suppressed Safe' collection, inaccessible to readers.\n\nHis support for the Tito regime led to him being targeted by Nevada Senator Pat McCarran, who between May and September, 1949, chaired a subcommittee to expose Soviet sympathizers among ethnic communities. \n\nPlagued by failing health, he is believed to have shot himself at his residence in Milford, New Jersey. He died at a time of political tension and intrigue in Yugoslavia, and there was press speculation in America that his death might have been an assassination by some Balkan faction, but no definitive proof of this theory has ever surfaced.\n\nAccording to John McAleer's Edgar Award-winning \"Rex Stout: A Biography\" (1977), it was the influence of Adamic that led Rex Stout to make his fictional detective Nero Wolfe a native of Montenegro, in what was then Yugoslavia. Stout and Adamic were friends and frequent political allies, and Stout expressed uncertainty to McAleer about the circumstances of Adamic's death. In any case, the demise seems to have inspired Stout's 1954 novel \"The Black Mountain\", in which Nero Wolfe returns to his homeland to hunt down the killers of an old friend.\n\n\n"}

It is named for Robert Crain of Baltimore. It is unique in Maryland in that it has a business route and a truck route which do not connect to their parent; however, the business route is also a part of the Robert Crain Highway. MD 3's current orientation is vestigial from the construction of Maryland's freeway system.\n\nMD 3 begins within the modified cloverleaf interchange of US 50 and unsigned I-595 (John Hanson Highway) and US 301 (Robert Crain Highway) in Bowie, Prince George's County. Within the interchange, US 301 heads south on Crain Highway and east along US 50; meanwhile, MD 3 heads north on Crain Highway, a four-lane divided highway. A short distance after beginning, the route comes to a partial cloverleaf interchange with Belair Drive, containing continuing connections from the US 50/US 301 interchange. Past here, the road runs north through wooded residential areas before the median widens and it bends to the north-northeast, continuing through forested areas with a few businesses. MD 3 continues northeast and the median narrows, with the road widening to eight lanes as it comes to an intersection with MD 450. At this point, MD 450 heads northeast for a concurrency with MD 3 along a six-lane divided highway, running through wooded areas and coming to a bridge over the Patuxent River.\n\nUpon crossing the Patuxent River, the road enters Anne Arundel County and continues northeast, with MD 450 splitting from MD 3 by turning to the east. MD 3 continues north along Crain Highway into Crofton, passing between woodland to the west and residential subdivisions to the east. The road heads into a commercial area and comes to an intersection with the northern terminus of MD 424. At this point, the route turns to the northeast and the median widens to include businesses in the center. MD 3 heads into Gambrills and runs through more commercial areas. The median narrows as the road passes to the southeast of the Waugh Chapel Towne Center and runs between businesses to the northwest and residential neighborhoods to the southeast. The median widens again and the route narrows to four lanes at the St. Stephen's Church Road intersection, passing through a mix of fields, woods, and businesses. The road comes to an intersection with the eastern terminus of MD 175 in Millersville before it heads northeast through woodland. MD 3 comes to its northern terminus at a modified cloverleaf interchange with I-97 and the eastern terminus of the MD 32 freeway. I-97 passes under MD 3 and occupies its median for a very short distance, with MD 3 ending at ramps merging into northbound I-97. The roadway of MD 3, however, continues for a minor distance longer, the southbound carriageway turning and crossing underneath I-97 to join with the northbound on the east side of the Interstate, and continuing north as Veterans Highway, running parallel to I-97 and providing access to MD 178.\n\nIn the past, Crain Highway originally held the designation MD 3, then US 301, and it currently carries both of these designations on different sections.\n\nStarted in 1922, Crain Highway was a new road built by the Maryland State Road Commission and ran from Baltimore to Southern Maryland. The original route of MD 3, completed in 1927 on a greenfield alignment, was once designated Maryland Route 761. With the opening of the Harry W. Nice Bridge in 1940 it was joined with U.S. Route 301. After the Chesapeake Bay Bridge was built in 1952, US 301, which at that time ran along the current alignment of MD 3, was rerouted along US 50, across the Bay Bridge, and north to Wilmington, Delaware, as a bypass around the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area. The former US 301 north of US 50 was then given back the MD 3 designation. After the construction of I-97, MD 3 was cut back to the I-97/MD 32 interchange, which led to the oddity of MD 3 Business in Glen Burnie being completely orphaned from its parent route. Despite this, the route is still designated MD 3 Business.\n\nIf MD 3 existed as a continuous route between its original southern end near Cobb Island (now signed as MD 254 and MD 257) and its original northern end at US 1 (Wilkens Avenue) in southwestern Baltimore, running via US 301, Interstate 97, short segments of the Baltimore Beltway and the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, and Monroe Street in downtown Baltimore, it would be 74.69 miles long. MD 3 was routed via the Beltway and the Parkway to divert it from city streets; originally it followed what is now MD 648 (Baltimore-Annapolis Boulevard) into Baltimore, meeting Monroe Street within today's interchange between the Parkway and Interstate 95.\n\nThe current alignment of the route was upgraded to a divided highway as US 301 in 1954.\n\nThe route is severely congested; attempts to bypass it with new routings have failed. One such routing would have been Interstate 297, a direct freeway link between Interstate 97 and US 50/US 301/I-595.\n\nMaryland Route 3 Business (MD 3 Bus.) is a business route of MD 3 through Glen Burnie and is the northernmost part of the Robert Crain Highway, connecting I-97 and MD 2. MD 3 Bus. begins on two-lane undivided New Cut Road at an arbitrary point just south of Grover Road in Severn, heading north-northeast through a mix of fields and residential neighborhoods and passing east of Archbishop Spalding High School. Past the Grover Road intersection, the route becomes a five-lane road with a center left-turn lane. MD 3 Bus. comes to an interchange with I-97 and becomes a four-lane divided highway, with the name changing to Crain Highway at the intersection with the northern terminus of Veterans Highway within the interchange. From here, the route widens to six lanes and continues through a largely commercial and residential area in Glen Burnie, curving to the north. The road passes under the MD 100 freeway without an interchange before narrowing to four lanes at the Oak Manor Drive intersection immediately after. MD 3 Bus. continues north through suburban areas, with the median transitioning to a center left-turn lane at the Madison Park Drive intersection. The road bends to the north-northeast and reaches a junction with the eastern terminus of MD 174. Following this, the route continues as a five lane road with a center left-turn lane that is lined with businesses, narrowing to a two-lane road at the 5th Avenue intersection. The road continues through residential and commercial areas, gaining a center turn lane again. At the Post 40 Road intersection, the Baltimore and Annapolis Trail crosses the route diagonally, forcing trail users to utilize two crosswalks. Immediately after, MD 3 Bus. intersects MD 648 in the downtown area of Glen Burnie. The route continues north-northeast through developed areas as a two-lane road, with MD 2 now running parallel to the route just one block to the east. Now with shoulders, MD 3 Bus. enters a heavy residential and commercial area for the remainder of its route. The route intersects the northern terminus of MD 270 before it makes a slight curve to the north. MD 3 Bus. continues north for a short distance before it reaches its northern terminus at an intersection with MD 2.\n\nMD 3 Bus. is the only business route in the Maryland state highway system that no longer connects with its parent route. This is due to the construction of a bypass freeway, which took over the MD 3 designation as it was built; MD 3 Bus. was designated for the present business route as it was constructed. However, the freeway was later designated as I-97, and MD 3's mainline was truncated to the point at which the freeway and MD 3 deviated onto different routes, south of MD 3 Bus. Despite this, several locations on I-97 have \"TO MD 3\" signs posted.\n\nJunction list\n\nMaryland Route 3 Truck is an unsigned designation given to Pratt Street eastbound and Lombard Street westbound in downtown Baltimore, running from MD 295 (Greene Street) east to President Street.\n\nThe route exists despite not connecting to the current alignment of MD 3. As mentioned before, this is due to the construction of the freeways south of Baltimore taking the MD 3 designation, including MD 295. Before being given the current MD 295 designation, Paca Street and Greene Street were part of MD 3, which was the connection of MD 3 Truck to MD 3's mainline.\n\n"}

Plays on Corpus Christi Day in 1475 included 'The trial and flagellation of Christ' and 'The Crucifixion'. The plays were then expanded into a three-day cycle on Whit Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. In the years between the plays there was the Chester Midsummer Watch Parade instead.\n\nThe plays are based on biblical texts, from creation to the Last Judgement. They were enacted by common guildsmen and craftsmen on mounted stages that were moved around the city streets, with each company or guild performing one play.\n\nPrior to the event the Crier read out these banns: \"The Aldermen and stewards of evrie societie and Companie draw youselves to your said severall companies according to Ancient Customme and soe to appear with your said severall Companies everie man as you are Called upon paine that shall fall thereon\". Such early banns exhorted each company to perform well.\n\nUnder Queen Elizabeth I the plays were seen as 'Popery' and banned by the English Church. Despite this, a play cycle was performed in 1568 and the cathedral paid for the stage and beer as in 1562. They were performed in 1572 despite a protest by an Evangelical minister. They were performed again, over four days, in 1575. This resulted in the mayor, when he retired from his office, being taken to the Star Chamber in London to answer allegations against him, but with the support of the council (or assembly) he was freed.\n\nOne edition of the plays begins with \"The Banes which are reade beefore the beginninge of the playes of Chester, 4 June, 1600\". Each play ends with \"Finis. Deo gracias! per me Georgi Bellin. 1592\". \n\nThe most well-known of the Chester plays relates the story of Noah and the Great Flood, traditionally acted by the Drawers of Dee (watercarriers). In it, Noah and his sons load up the provisions and the animals while his wife gossips with the neighbours. Noah urges her to hurry aboard, \"\"The flood comes in fleeting fast; On every side it speadeth full fare; For fear of drowning I am agast; Good gossip, let us draw near\"\". However, Noah's wife keeps on drinking and gossiping until, eventually, the sons carry her onto the ark by force. At the end of the play, God provides a rainbow as a token that mankind has had enough punishment for its sinful deeds.\n\nThe plays were revived in Chester in 1951 as part of the Festival of Britain and are presented there every five years. The 2018 run of plays was from 27 June to 14 July.\n\nThe Players of St Peter have been performing the plays in London roughly every five years since 1946.\n\nUnder the direction of Jeff Dailey, the American Theatre of Actors in New York City performed the penultimate play, \"The Coming of Antichrist\", in August 2017.\n\nIn the 20th century, the Noah's Flood play was set operatically by both Benjamin Britten (\"Noye's Fludde\") and Igor Stravinsky (\"The Flood\").\n\n\"The Mysteries\" is an adaption by the poet Tony Harrison, principally based upon the Wakefield Cycle, but incorporating scenes from the York, Chester and N-Town canons, first performed in 1977 at the National Theatre, and again revived in 2000 as a celebration of the millennium.\n\n\n\n"}

Chief Justice Debra Stephens was sworn in on January 5, 2020, and succeeds Mary Fairhurst, who retired for medical reasons. \nPrior to January 1997 (pursuant to a Constitutional amendment adopted in 1995) the post of Chief Justice was held for a 2-year term by a justice who (i) was one of the Justices with 2 years left in their term, (ii) was the most senior in years of service of that cohort, and (iii) (generally) had not previously served as Chief Justice. The last Chief Justice under the rotation system, Barbara Durham was the architect of the present internal election system, and was the first to be elected under the new procedure, serving until her resignation in 1999.\n\nThe court convenes in the Temple of Justice, a historic building on the Washington State Capitol campus in Olympia, Washington.\n\nThe persuasiveness of the Court's decisions reaches far beyond Washington's borders. A Supreme Court of California study published in 2007 found that the Washington Supreme Court's decisions were the second most widely followed by the appellate courts of all other US states in the period from 1940 to 2005 (second only to California).\n\nMembers of the Court are elected to six-year terms, with three justices elected in each even-numbered year in a nonpartisan election with a top-two primary. Judicial elections in Washington, including for the Supreme Court, are frequently uncontested and incumbents typically win reelection. The last time a justice lost reelection was in 2010 when Charlies Wiggins defeated Richard B. Sanders, who had previously defeated Rosselle Pekelis in 1995. When Chief Justice Keith M. Callow lost to Charles W. Johnson in 1990, it was the first time in 40 years an incumbent had lost.\n\nThe only required qualification for justices is that they are admitted to practice law in Washington.\n\nIn case of a vacancy, the Governor of Washington may appoint a replacement who must stand in the next election to fill the unexpired term. Five of the current nine judges were originally appointed.\n\nThe early history of the Washington Supreme Court has been described as follows:\n\nCandidates for election were originally nominated at party conventions, but in 1907 it became a direct nonpartisan election.\n\nCarolyn R. Dimmick was the first woman to sit on the court, taking her seat in 1981. Barbara Durham was the first female chief justice, selected in 1995. Charles Z. Smith, appointed 1988, was the first African American to serve on the court. Mary Yu became the first LGBT, Asian American, and Latina member in 2014. A majority of justices has been female since 2013. After the appointment of Helen Whitener in 2020, the court was called \"arguably the most diverse court, state or federal, in American history,\" with various incumbents reflecting the state's white, black, Hispanic, Asian American, Native American, LGBT, immigrant, Jewish, and disabled populations.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2012280", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2012280", "title": "Operation Grand Slam", "text": "Operation Grand Slam\n\nOperation Grand Slam was a key operation of the 1965 Indo-Pakistani War. It refers to a plan drawn up by the Pakistan Army, in May 1965, to attack the vital Akhnoor Bridge in Jammu and Kashmir. The bridge was not only the lifeline of an entire infantry division in Jammu and Kashmir, but could also be used to threaten Jammu, an important logistical point for Indian forces. The operation ended in a failure for the Pakistan Army as the stated military objectives were not achieved and they subsequently were forced to retreat following a counterattack by the Indian Army.\n\nFollowing the Rann of Kutch affair, which resulted in territorial gains for Pakistan following a boundary award later in 1968, the political atmosphere in Pakistan was jubilant. Believing the Indians were badly demoralised and the Muslims of Jammu and Kashmir would revolt against them with a little help, General Ayub Khan gave his approval for Operation Gibraltar, a plan to provoke uprisings in Jammu and Kashmir by infiltrating teams of military personnel to conduct sabotage and prod the Kashmiri people against Indian forces. The infiltration started in the first week of August 1965, as Pakistani infantry infiltrated the border in teams of twos and threes, eventually swelling to more than 4000–5000 in number.\n\nIdentifying the insurgents as Pakistan Army regulars, India countered them by bringing in additional troops. The Indian Army also launched attacks on the logistical bases of the insurgents in Pakistan-administered Kashmir.\n\nThe Pakistani Army commenced Operation Grand Slam at 0500 hours on 1 September 1965. The aim was to ease the pressure on the 12th Division, which was defending against repeated Indian attacks, and to guard against the threat to the city of Muzaffarabad from the gain by Indian forces of strategic areas such as Hajipir pass in Pakistan-administered Kashmir.\n\nThe Akhnoor sector was lightly defended by four Indian infantry battalions and a squadron of tanks. The infantry was stretched thin along the border and the AMX-13 tanks were no match for the Pakistani M47 Patton and M48 Patton tanks. Against a militarily stronger and larger Pakistani thrust, the Indian forces retreated from their defensive positions. According to Pakistani military historian Major (retd.) A. H. Amin, the Pakistani forces in Operation Grandslam had a 6 to 1 advantage over Indian AMX-13 tanks, which were like 'matchboxes' in front of the Pakistani Pattons. In terms of artillery, Pakistan's 8 inch guns were superior to anything that Indians had at that time and had an overall superiority of 6 to 1.\n\nOn the second day of the attack, the GOC of the 12th Infantry Division Major General Akhtar Hussain Malik, commanding the overall forces in the area, was replaced by Major General Yahya Khan, the GOC of the 7th Infantry Division, which delayed the attack by one day. Not only did this decision cause confusion among the Pakistani officer cadre, the delay also permitted the Indians to rush reinforcements to the sector. When the attack recommenced on 3 September, the Indian forces in the sector were sufficiently reinforced to hold out for a few more days, but they did not have the strength to launch a counterattack. As the attack carried on for two more days without any significant gains in territory, the Indian Army opened up a new front, on 6 September, across the sensitive state of Punjab in Pakistan. The advance of the Indian Army also threatened to cut across the right flank of the Pakistani attack. Realising the gravity of the threat, the Pakistani Army stopped its thrust into Kashmir and diverted forces to counter the Indian incursion.\n\n"}

It has an apparent visual magnitude of 5.5, which is bright enough to be seen with the naked eye outside of urban areas.\n\n18 Scorpii has some physical properties in common with the Sun, a G-type star. Cayrel de Strobel (1996) included it in her review of the stars most similar to the Sun, and Porto de Mello & da Silva (1997) identified it as a younger solar twin. Some scientists therefore believe the prospects for life in its vicinity are good. However, no planet has yet been discovered orbiting this star.\n\n18 Scorpii is a main sequence star of spectral and luminosity type G2 Va, with the luminosity class of 'V' indicating it is generating energy through the nuclear fusion of hydrogen in its core region. Sousa \"et al.\" (2008) found its metallicity to be about 1.1 times that of the Sun, which means the abundance of elements other than hydrogen or helium is 10% greater. The radius of this star, as measured using interferometry by Bazot \"et al.\" (2011), is 101% the radius of the Sun. When combined with the results of asteroseismology measurements, this allows the mass of the star to be estimated as 102% of the Sun's mass. This star is radiating 106% of the Sun's luminosity from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 5,433 K. It is this heat that gives the star the yellow-hued glow of a G-type star.\n\nAccording to Lockwood (2002), it has a temporal photometric behavior very similar to the Sun. Its brightness variation over its entire activity cycle is 0.09%, about the same as the Sun's brightness variations during recent solar cycles. Using the technique of Zeeman-Doppler imaging, Petit et al. (2008) have detected its surface magnetic field, showing that its intensity and geometry are very similar to the large-scale solar magnetic field. The estimated period for the activity cycle of 18 Scorpii is about seven years, which is significantly shorter than the Sun's, and its overall chromospheric activity level is noticeably higher. Like the Sun, it has a hot corona with a temperature in the range of 1.5–2 MK and an X-ray luminosity of .\n\nThough 18 Scorpii is only slightly more metal-rich overall than the Sun, its lithium abundance is about three times as high; for this reason, Meléndez & Ramírez (2007) have suggested that 18 Scorpii be called a \"quasi solar twin\", reserving the term solar twin for stars (such as HIP 56948) that match the Sun, within the observational errors, for all parameters.\n\n18 Scorpii is a young star at 2.9 Gyr (2.9 Billion years old). 18 Scorpii has not yet entered its stable burning stage. The Sun at 4.7 Gyr is at its most stable stage. Due to 18 Scorpii age, it is at the edge of range for a solar twin, and is more of a Solar analog.\n\n18 Scorpii was identified in September 2003 by astrobiologist Margaret Turnbull from the University of Arizona in Tucson as one of the most promising nearby candidates for hosting life, based on her analysis of the HabCat list of stars. This is a solitary star and, as of 2005, radial velocity measurements have not yet revealed the presence of planets orbiting it. Nor does this star display the level of excess infrared emission that would otherwise suggest the presence of unconsolidated circumstellar matter, such as a debris disk.\n\n18 Scorpii was thought to be 5.0 billion years old in the past, new measurements in 2013 found 18 Scorpii to be younger at 2.9 billion years old.\n\n"}

{"id": "2012289", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2012289", "title": "Dumbarton Castle", "text": "Dumbarton Castle\n\nDumbarton Castle (, ) has the longest recorded history of any stronghold in Scotland. It overlooks the Scottish town of Dumbarton, and sits on a plug of volcanic basalt known as Dumbarton Rock which is high.\n\nAccording to the local museum, Dumbarton Rock is a volcanic plug of basalt created 334 million years ago, with the softer exterior of the volcano having weathered away.\n\nAt least as far back as the Iron Age, this has been the site of a strategically important settlement as evidenced by archaeological finds.\n\nThe people that came to reside there in the era of Roman Britain were known to have traded with the Romans - though these may or may not have been the Picts that dwelled in Dumbarton in the Bronze Age & early-mid Iron Age. \nHowever the first written record about a settlement there was marked in a letter Saint Patrick wrote to King Ceretic of Alt Clut in the late 5th century.\n\nDavid Nash Ford has proposed that Dumbarton was the Cair Brithon (\"Fort of the Britons\") listed by Nennius among the 28 cities of Sub-Roman Britain. From the fifth century until the ninth, the castle was the centre of the independent Brythonic Kingdom of Strathclyde. Alt Clut or Alcluith (, , \"Rock of the Clyde\"), the Brythonic name for Dumbarton Rock, became a metonym for kingdom. The king of Dumbarton in about AD 570 was Riderch Hael, who features in Welsh and Latin works.\n\nDuring his reign Merlin was said to have stayed at Alt Clut. The medieval \"Scalacronica\" of Sir Thomas Grey records the legend that \"Arthur left Hoël of Brittany his nephew sick at Alcluit in Scotland.\" Hoël made a full recovery, but was besieged in the castle by the Scots and Picts. The story first appeared in Geoffrey of Monmouth's \"Historia Regum Britanniae\". Amongst lists of three things, in the triads of the \"Red Book of Hergest\", the third \"Unrestrained Ravaging\" was Aeddan Fradog (the Wily, perhaps Áedán mac Gabráin), coming to the court of Rhydderch the Generous at Alclud, who left neither food nor drink nor beast alive. This battle also appears in stories of Myrddin Wyllt, the Merlin of Geoffrey of Monmouth's \"Vita Merlini\", perhaps conflated with the battle of Arfderydd, located as Arthuret by some authors.\n\nIn 756, the first (and second) losses of Dumbarton Rock were recorded. A joint force of Picts and Northumbrians captured the fortress after a siege, only to lose it again a few days later. By 870, it was home to a tightly packed British settlement, which served as a fortress and as the capital of Alt Clut. In 871, the Irish-based Viking kings Amlaíb and Ímar laid siege to Dumbarton Rock. The fortress fell in four months, after its water supply failed. The kings are recorded to have returned to Ireland with 200 ships and a host of British, English, and Pictish captives. These prisoners may have included the ruling family of Alt Clut including the king Arthgal ap Dyfnwal, who was slain the following year under uncertain circumstances. Following the Viking destruction of the fortress, Dumbarton Rock does not appear on record again until the 13th century, and the capital of the restructured Kingdom of Strathclyde appears to have relocated up the Clyde to the vicinity of Partick and Govan.\n\nIn medieval Scotland, Dumbarton (\"Dùn Breatainn\", which means \"the fortress of the Britons\") was an important royal castle. It sheltered David II and his young wife, Joan of The Tower after the Scottish defeat at Halidon Hill in 1333.\n\nIn 1425 the castle was attacked by James the Fat, youngest son of Murdoch Stewart, Duke of Albany, who had been imprisoned by King James I of Scotland on charges of treason. James the Fat became a rallying point for enemies of the King, and raised a rebellion against the crown. He marched on the town of Dumbarton and burned it, but was unable to take the castle, whose defender John Colquhoun successfully held out against James' men.\n\nThe former supporters of James III under the leadership of John Stewart, 1st Earl of Lennox met up at Dumbarton Castle in October 1489. They had hoped to gain the support of Henry VII of England. James IV defeated them in a battle between the Touch and Menteith hills near Stirling on 11 and 12 October. James IV used Dumbarton as the west coast base for his navy and campaigns to subdue the Western Isles. James was at Dumbarton with the Chancellor of Scotland, Colin Campbell, 1st Earl of Argyll, in November 1489. He had the use of a ship belonging to the Laird of Luss. In the following February a royal ship was 'chaysit' by the English and lost some of her cables. In 1494 a row barge was built at Dumbarton for the king using timber from Loch Lomond.\n\nIn March 1495 James IV was provided with a camp bed for use at sea and a boat carried cannon to Dumbarton. Patrick Hepburn, 1st Earl of Bothwell, was made Captain of the castle on 1 April 1495. A man played on the clarschaw, a Gaelic harp, for the King. In 1505 Dumbarton was the King's base for visiting the Western Isles. One ship's mast was made from timber from Drymen. On 5 June James was entertained by a French 'quhissilar', perhaps playing a recorder and on 8 June James played cards with John Murray and Master Robert Cockburn losing £4-10 shillings, and later that day attended Evensong in the Parish kirk and College of Dumbarton. In 1505 John Ramsay built a ship for the King called the \"Columb\", ( Saint Columba being the father of Christianity in Scotland ). In December 1505 a sword that had belonged to William Wallace was repaired.\n\nOn 18 May 1515 the \"James\" or the \"Margaret\" with six other ships brought John Stewart, Regent Albany to Dumbarton. These royal ships were repaired at Dumbarton in July and new docks were made for them. John Drummond of Milnab brought fourteen of their guns to Glasgow. In September Regent Albany held court at Dumbarton, and received Thomas Benolt, the English Clarenceux King of Arms. The Carrick Herald and Clarenceux were sent to Lord Maxwell. In March 1516 Albany issued six letters of remission (forgiveness) to those who had held the castle for Lennox against the king in 1489. Regent Albany returned to France from Dumbarton in 1524.\n\nIn 1526 John Stewart, 3rd Earl of Lennox fortified Dumbarton against the Douglas faction who had control of the young James V, but his forces were defeated by Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus at the battle of Linlithgow Bridge. James Hamilton of Finnart, who was implicated in the death of the Earl of Lennox, was given custody of the castle till 1531. Later in his personal reign James V used the castle as a prison for those convicted at the justice ayre, receiving their fines and composition payments in 1539. In 1540 James circumnavigated Scotland from the Forth and arrived at Dumbarton with Cardinal Beaton, the Earl of Huntly, and the Earl of Arran each leading a force of five hundred men. This expedition was later published by Nicolas de Nicolay Seigneur d'Arfeville, cosmographer to the King of France in 1583, with the first modern map of Scotland's coastline.\n\nMatthew, Earl of Lennox had been an ally of the French party in Scotland led by Mary of Guise but committed himself to the pro-English faction. In 1544 munitions and ten thousand French crowns of the sun arrived with Jacques de la Brosse at Dumbarton's harbour and were secured by Lennox and the Earl of Glencairn. Lennox then went into England, leaving the castle in the keeping of William Stirling of Glorat. Lennox signed a deal with Henry VIII of England offering Dumbarton Castle and the Isle of Bute in return for land in England and marriage to Henry's niece Margaret Douglas, and the future Governorship of Scotland if circumstances permitted. Lennox undertook to prevent the infant queen Mary being taken from Scotland. However, George Stirling of Glorat, unhappy at this policy, prevented Lennox returning into the castle and he was forced to sail to Ireland. George Stirling declared that he would hold the castle in the name of the young queen only. The Privy Council of Scotland agreed to George Stirling's plan. Despite this, more French troops landed at Dumbarton under the leadership of Lorges Montgomery, the soldier who later killed Henry II of France at a joust in 1559.\n\nIn May 1545 Lennox tried to take the castle, with soldiers commanded by his brother, Robert Stewart, Bishop of Caithness. He had sailed from Chester with around 20 followers in May 1546 in the \"Katherine Goodman\" and a pinnace. Regent Arran besieged the castle with a superior force, having borrowed the artillery of the Earl of Argyle. George Stirling of Glorat surrendered after 20 days and made terms. The chronicle historian John Lesley wrote that the Captain and the Bishop surrendered the castle to Arran and were rewarded, after negotiation by the Earl of Huntly. The siege at Dumbarton delayed Arran's action at the siege of St Andrews Castle on the East coast of Scotland. \nThereafter the castle was in the hands of Regent Arran and he held court in person there in July giving legal remission to the keeper of the Castle and in March 1547 acknowledging the good service of George Stirling of Glorat in rendering the castle to him.\n\nAs the war of the Rough Wooing continued, by 22 February 1548 Mary, Queen of Scots was in the castle. Alexander Cunningham, 5th Earl of Glencairn wrote to Mary of Guise from Dumbarton that he had received a French cargo, and it would be as safe as if it were in Stirling Castle. Mary of Guise was at the castle in the first days of May 1548 and Mary, Queen of Scots was kept at the castle for several months before her embarkation for France for safety on 13 July 1548. The sailing however was delayed by adverse winds till 7 August 1548. Her party including the Four Marys left the Clyde in a fleet under the command of Nicolas de Villegagnon. They sailed around the west coast of Ireland, to avoid English ships commanded by Edward Clinton.\n\nIn France she was soon betrothed to the young dauphin Francis. Seven years after the end of the war of the Rough Wooing, in 1557, five hundred Gascon soldiers arrived at Dumbarton destined to serve on the borders against the English for Mary of Guise according to a rumour heard by Gilbert Kennedy, 3rd Earl of Cassilis.\n\nAfter the defeat at the battle of Langside John Fleming, 5th Lord Fleming, keeper of the Castle went with Queen Mary into England but was allowed to return. When William Kirkcaldy of Grange governor of Edinburgh Castle changed to support Mary, this became a problem for Regent Moray. The first siege was lifted because of the assassination of Regent Moray. The assassin James Hamilton of Bothwellhaugh was welcomed at the castle. Fleming's defence of Dumbarton for Mary was satirized in a ballad printed by Robert Lekprevik in May 1570; \"The tressoun of Dumbertane.\" Attributed to Robert Sempill, the ballad describes Fleming's failed ambush of Sir William Drury in May 1570. In October 1570 during the Marian civil war the castle was fortified for Mary against the supporters of James VI of Scotland with stones obtained by demolishing churches and houses in Dumbarton and Cardross. The castle was captured by the forces of Regent Lennox led by Thomas Crawford of Jordanhill and John Cunningham of Drumquhassle in the early hours of 2 April 1571, who used ladders to scale the rock and surprise the garrison.\n\nDumbarton Castle was used as prison for Regent Morton in June 1581 before his execution in Edinburgh. On 8 September 1582 the castle was put unto the keeping of Walter Stewart of Taberstoun an ally of Esmé Stewart, 1st Duke of Lennox, the King's favourite. The Duke of Lennox was displaced by the Gowrie Regime and went to the castle in secret pretending to be travelling from Edinburgh to nearby Dalkeith Palace. Lennox had his own ship there described as a barque. Robert Bowes, the English resident agent, expected the Duke of Lennox would sail to France from Dumbarton \"having well victualled his shippe there.\" Other observers were anxious that the castle might become a foothold for French forces in Scotland allied to Lennox and his faction. In December 1582 two Englishmen in Lennox's service at Dumbarton left by his ship from Largs. Lennox himself travelled to France through England, never to return.\n\nAlthough few buildings remain from this period there are records of works in 1617, 1618, and 1628-9. A replacement Wallace Tower was built superseding the medieval building. In June 1618 masons were working on the upper storey and it was decided to make the tower larger. Externally it was finished with lime plaster called harling. At the south side there was a bell house. By 1627 it was discovered that the keeper Sir John Stewart of Methven had neglected the fortress. He was replaced by Sir John Stewart of Traquair who recorded the poor state of the building. Surviving accounts mostly record work on the artillery and the 'foir yet wall' a defence on the southern side. The Scottish Parliament in 1644 judged that the castle was likely to more hurtful than useful to the country.\n\nIn November 1645 the Committee of Estates approved the recruitment of thirty extra soldiers by the keeper John Semple to guard the increased number of prisoners. The castle's strategic importance declined after Oliver Cromwell's death in 1658. However, due to threats posed by Jacobites and the French in the eighteenth century, new structures and defences were built and the castle was garrisoned until World War II. Some documentation for these later works is preserved in the National Archives of Scotland.\n\nSeveral lists of the castle's contents survive, including inventories from 1510, 1571, 1580, 1644, and 1668. These list guns and furniture and name many locations in the castle. There is also a list of cannon transported by John Drummond of Milnab to Dumbarton in 1536. In 1510 St Patricks chapel contained an old parchment mass book, a pewter chalice, and liturgical cloths. The hall had four tables and next to that was a \"chalmer of Dess\", a 'solar' in English terms with a bed. The Wallace tower was protected with an iron yett and draw bar, there were bedchambers within and a bell at the head of the tower; the 'Wynde Hall' contained another bed.\n\nIn August 1536 George Stirling of Glorat took delivery from John Drummond the king's Master Wright of four great guns and six falcons on carriages with wheels, thirty three bronze hagbut hand-guns and four iron culverins, with ammunition and powder and ramrods for the big guns. John Drummond took away an old brass gun that was long.\n\nIn 1571 amonngst the cannon and guns there was a \"gross culverin\", two small \"batteris\", and a French \"moyen\" mounted for use on the walls. Another moyen was suitable for action in the field. There were two Brittany-made falcons on the walls, a quarter falcon and a \"double barse\". Provisions included eleven hogshead of biscuit. Some of the guns were subsequently taken to besiege Edinburgh Castle during the Marian civil war.\n\nThe document compiled in 1580 was \"the inventar of the munitioun and uther insicht geir underwrittin left in the castell of Dumbertane be Johnne Conninghame of Drumquhassill and deliverit be the said Johnne to William Stewart of Cabirston in name and behalf of ane noble and potent lord Esme erll of Lennox lord Darnley and Obeigny on the 27 August 1580\". There were six large cannon. The bed in the \"chamber of dais\" was now described as 'ane stand bed of eistland tymmar with ruf and pannell of the same', a bed made from imported Baltic oak.\n\nBy 1644, when John Sempill was made keeper the 'Chamber of deisse' still contained a bed with a chamber pot and truckle bed for a servant, but it also contained armaments. There were twelve ram-rods, and three worms' - screws for unloading guns, three hagbuts and an iron flail. The hall contained twelve broken pikes, four without their iron blades. The contents of the armoury included thirty-three corslets, 105 helmets, and 43 swords.\n\nIn 1668 the Governor Francis Montgomerie of Giffin recorded that the first floor of a lodging called the 'new chamber' contained 'a quantity of old rusty guns and sword, so rusted broke and spoiled that they can never serve for any use, above the beds were 'insufficient' and in the top room there was spoiled matches. The windows of this new lodging were broken. Montgomerie was worried about the water-supply from the loch and the 'laigh' low well.\n\n\n\n\nToday all visible traces of the Dark-Age Alt Clut, its buildings and defences, have gone. Not much survives from the medieval castle: the 14th-century Portcullis Arch, the foundations of the Wallace Tower, and what may be the foundations of the White Tower. There is a 16th-century guard house, which includes a face which according to legend is \"Fause Menteith\", who betrayed William Wallace.\n\nMost of the existing structures were built in the 18th century, including the Governor's House, built for John Kennedy, 8th Earl of Cassilis, and fortifications which demonstrated the struggle by military engineers to adapt an intractable site to contemporary defensive needs. The splendid views from the twin summits of the White Tower Crag and the Beak remind us why this rocky outcrop was chosen as 'the fortress of the Britons' centuries ago.\n\nThe castle is open on a daily basis during the summer season and Saturday-Wednesday in the winter. Visitors must climb the 557 steps to see the White Tower Crag and other features.\n\nDumbarton Rock is in state ownership and is legally protected by the Scottish Government as a Scheduled Ancient Monument, to conserve it for future generations. Activities such as rock climbing are forbidden; any change or damage caused is considered a criminal offence.\n\nUp to 1919 Dumbarton Rock was the origin (meridian) of the 6 inch and 1:2500 Ordnance Survey maps for Dumbartonshire. After that the maps for Dumbartonshire were drawn according to the meridian of Lanark Church Spire in Lanarkshire.\n\nIn 1803 Dorothy and William Wordsworth visited the castle and were told that a ruin on the top of the highest eminence had been a windmill and were shown a trout, boxed up in a well close by to the guard room, that had been there for thirty years.\n\nThe castle features in \"The Scottish Chiefs\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2012314", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2012314", "title": "MTV2 (Canadian TV channel)", "text": "MTV2 (Canadian TV channel)\n\nMTV2 is a Canadian pay television channel focused on lifestyle and general entertainment programming aimed at youth and teen audiences. The channel is owned by Bell Media, with the MTV2 name and branding used under an agreement with the ViacomCBS Networks Americas division of ViacomCBS.\n\nOn November 24, 2000, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) announced the licensees of the new, much-sought after, Category 1 digital services. Craig Media, in partnership with TD Capital Group Ltd, was granted a licence for a youth-oriented service known as \"Connect\", which would be catered to teens and young adults (but primarily the former) with programming such as \"informal education, human interest, sitcoms, animation, and video clips\". Due to genre protection rules forbidding digital channels from unduly competing with existing analog services (in particular, MuchMusic), the channel was forbidden from devoting more than 10% of its weekly schedule to music videos.\n\nNonetheless, in August 2001, Craig Media announced that it had reached an agreement with MTV Networks to license programming and the MTV brand in Canada for the channel, prompting a pre-launch name change to MTV Canada. Prior to the channel's launch, Craig purchased TD Capital Group's interest in the channel. The channel launched as MTV Canada on October 18, 2001. Shortly afterward, Craig sold a minority interest in the service to MTV Networks. MTV Canada aired a mix of Canadian-produced programs (including \"Pepsi Breakout\" and \"MTV Select\"), as well as shows from the American MTV channel (such as \"TRL\" and \"The Real World\").\nThe new channel faced a formal complaint to the CRTC from Much's owner CHUM Limited, who argued that it devoted at least 60% of its programming to music videos, in violation of its license. CHUM also accused Craig of using its promise of a teen lifestyle network as a backdoor to gain approval for a channel that would, ultimately, encroach on MuchMusic's protected format instead. Craig disputed the allegations, noting that music was an aspect of youth culture, and accusing CHUM of misrepresenting any programming \"that has some connection to the general topic of music or music videos\" as counting as \"music video clips\". \n\nThe CRTC program categories distinguish between music videos and music-related programming that did not involve music videos, but the commission ruled that music videos contained within music-related programming such as \"MTV Select\" and \"Making the Video\" contributed towards the program category, and put MTV Canada over the 10% limit. The commission also displayed concern for the channel's predominant focus on music programming, as it was at odds with its commitment to deliver a broadly teen-based service as licensed. The CRTC also noted Craig's malicious compliance on its promise to devote 15% of its schedule to \"informal education/recreation & leisure\" programming, which consisted of recreational extreme sports programming aired primarily during overnight timeslots with low viewership, and did not include programming produced by \"independent educational authorities\" as promised. The CRTC thus ordered Craig Media to address these shortcomings.\n\nCHUM's disputes over the channel were soon rendered moot when it ultimately acquired Craig Media in 2004, primarily to gain control of its A-Channel television stations in western Canada. However, per a clause in the licensing agreement, Viacom exercised its right to pull out of the venture upon the change in ownership. On June 9, 2005, CHUM announced it would rebrand the channel as Razer, a change that took effect on June 30 of that year. The new channel was built on interactivity, allowing its audience to \"program, host and contribute to elements to the service and make it their own\". In addition to the new programming slate, Razer debuted \"RazerTXT\", a new programming block where viewers could play a selection of SMS games while watching the shows. Razer would later debut \"Kamikaze\", the branding and programming block used for various anime titles as well as shows such as \"Happy Tree Friends\".\n\nMeanwhile, Bell Globemedia (later CTVglobemedia) struck a licensing agreement with MTV Networks to launch its own MTV channel (previously known as talktv) in early 2006. In July 2006, Bell Globemedia announced that it would purchase CHUM for an estimated CAD$1.7 billion, including its interest in Razer. The sale was approved by the CRTC on June 8, 2007, with the transaction completed on June 22.\n\nOn August 1, 2008, Razer was relaunched as MTV2. Unlike the original channel (now known as Juicebox), with the vast majority of its programming consisting of music videos, the new channel became much closer in format to its U.S. counterpart. Because of their respective licences, it can air music videos and music programming unlike the current main MTV channel in Canada.\n\nOwnership changed hands again when on September 10, 2010, BCE (a minority shareholder in CTVglobemedia) announced that it planned to acquire 100% interest in CTVglobemedia for a total debt and equity transaction cost of CAD$3.2 billion. The deal was approved by the CRTC on March 7, 2011 and was finalized on April 1 of that year, when CTVglobemedia was rebranded as Bell Media.\n\nPresently, MTV2 airs a mix of comedies, documentaries, reality shows, and dramas. As of 2015, the channel doesn't air any of the original programs of its American counterpart, although some of its acquired shows have aired in syndication on MTV2 in the U.S or were produced by its sister channel, MTV, both domestically and internationally.\n\nA high-definition simulcast of the channel was launched on October 16, 2018 and first carried by Shaw Direct.\n"}

The title suggests a word play on the Christmas carol The Little Drummer Boy. The story follows the manipulations of Martin Kurtz, an Israeli spymaster who intends to kill Khalil – a Palestinian terrorist who is bombing Jewish-related targets in Europe, particularly Germany – and Charlie, an English actress and double agent working on behalf of the Israelis.\n\nMartin Kurtz, an Israeli spy working in a clandestine agency to allow plausible deniability for his superiors, recruits Charlie, a \n26 year-old radical left-wing English actress, as part of an elaborate scheme to discover the whereabouts of Khalil, a Palestinian terrorist. Joseph is Charlie's case officer. Khalil's younger brother Salim is abducted, interrogated, and killed by Kurtz's unit. Joseph impersonates Salim and travels through Europe with Charlie to make Khalil believe that Charlie and Salim are lovers. When Khalil discovers the affair and contacts Charlie, the Israelis are able to track him down.\n\nCharlie is taken to Palestinian refugee camps to be trained as a bomber. She becomes more sympathetic to the Palestinian cause, and her divided loyalties bring her close to collapse. Charlie is sent on a mission to place a bomb at a lecture given by an Israeli moderate whose peace proposals are not to Khalil's liking. She carries out the mission under the Israelis' supervision. As a result, Joseph kills Khalil. Charlie subsequently has a mental breakdown caused by the strain of her mission and her own internal contradictions.\n\n\"The Little Drummer Girl\" was made into a feature film by George Roy Hill in 1984. It starred Diane Keaton as Charlie, Yorgo Voyagis as Joseph and Klaus Kinski as Kurtz. The film changes Charlie from an English twentysomething to a thirty-ish American. The film was released on DVD in 2006.\n\nA BBC/AMC miniseries adaptation was directed by Park Chan-wook, starring Florence Pugh, Alexander Skarsgård, and Michael Shannon. It also stars Clare Holman, , Charles Dance, Simona Brown, Michael Moshonov, , and Max Irons; the series debuted in November 2018.\n\nSome reviewers described \"The Little Drummer Girl\" as transcending the spy novel genre. \"\"The Little Drummer Girl\" is about spies\", said William F. Buckley, writing in \"The New York Times\", \"as \"Madame Bovary\" is about adultery or \"Crime and Punishment\" about crime.\" \n\nJohn Grisham, when queried by Bill Moyers, picked \"The Little Drummer Girl\" as one of his favourite novels, saying,\n\nI love to read John le Carré, the British guy who's really probably my favourite writer. \"The Little Drummer Girl\" is a book I read about every four or five years. It's just so clever and brilliantly plotted. It's the kinda book – and his writing is off the charts, the way he expresses himself and the way he describes people and dialogue – and every time I read that book, it inspires me to be better.\nSeveral real-life people have been mentioned as inspirations for the character of Charlie.\n\n\n"}

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 16, 2003, and was seen by around 22 million people during this broadcast. The episode is referred to as the 301st in the opening theme as it originally aired the same day as the episode \"Barting Over\", which was promoted as the 300th episode.\n\nWhile watching a horror movie show hosted by Boobarella (the show's take on Cassandra Peterson's Elvira character), a commercial plays for the Ribwich (the show's take on McDonald's McRib sandwich), a new Krusty Burger sandwich in which meat from an unknown animal is processed and molded into the shape of ribs. Homer excitedly samples the Ribwich, recently arrived at the Krusty Burger in Springfield, and becomes addicted.\n\nThe next day, Principal Skinner holds a spelling bee at the school. Lisa is excited when she wins the spelling bee, for which she is awarded a scale model of the planet Mars (a kickball with the word \"Mars\" written on it). She continues to the state spelling bee, and wins again, qualifying her for the Spellympics to be held in Calgary.\n\nMarge suggests they celebrate by going to a movie, but Homer says he has \"important daddy business\" — which turns out to be eating Ribwiches with Lenny and Carl at Krusty Burger, only to find that the limited-time-only Ribwiches are out of stock. However, a \"Ribhead\" (a fan of the Ribwich) tells Homer that it is being tested in other markets, so he decides to follow a group of Ribheads as they track the release of the Ribwich tour schedule.\n\nAt the Spellympics, hosted by George Plimpton, Lisa wins the semi-finals and secures a spot in the finals. The other two finalists are Sun Moon, a Korean girl, and Alex, a cute boy with big round glasses and a speech impediment who proves to be extremely popular. Plimpton takes Lisa aside and tells her that if she lets Alex win, she will be given a free scholarship to any Seven Sisters college and a free George Plimpton hot plate. Lisa is torn between wanting to win the Spellympics and free college, and asks Marge whether they can afford to send her to college. Marge is unsure, but promises to do whatever it takes to get Lisa into college, but Lisa is still uneasy since she is aware of Homer's low salary.\n\nIn San Francisco, Krusty informs all the Ribheads that the Ribwich will no longer be made, as the animal from which it was made is now extinct. He tosses the last one into the crowd. Homer catches it, fighting off the others. An Italian Ribhead offers Homer the \"lease-a\" to his car for the last Ribwich, and Homer remembers Lisa and the Spellympics. He agrees to the trade and takes off in the car, reaching the Spellympics finals just in time to see Lisa spell \"intransigence\" and encourage her. Lisa, happy to see her father, tells everyone that she was told to take a dive, but then unintentionally misspells her word. Lisa loses, and since she did not do it on purpose, Plimpton rescinds his offer.\n\nOn the way back to Springfield, Homer tries to cheer up Lisa when she admits that she let down everyone in town. However, she finds that in coming second she has become Springfield's most successful native ever (even outachieving the Springfield woman who once dated Charles Grodin). In her honor, the town carved Lisa's face on the side of a mountain.\n\nA lengthy scene at the beginning of the show where Bart rushes to do everything he planned on doing during summer vacation was cut for time. The scene was later placed in the opening of the season 17 episode \"The Monkey Suit\", which aired three years later.\n\nThe sequence where Homer becomes addicted to the Ribwich is a parody of the Darren Aronofsky film \"Requiem for a Dream\" (2000). Boobarella, who appears at the beginning of the episode, is a parody of Elvira, the seductive gothic character portrayed by Cassandra Peterson. While opening the school, Principal Skinner sings a parody of \"School's Out\" by Alice Cooper. The song played during the Spellympics and during the credits is \"I Put a Spell on You\" by Screamin' Jay Hawkins. The song played at the beginning of the Spellympics finals is \"Get Ready for This\" by 2 Unlimited. This song was also played in the episode \"Homer and Ned's Hail Mary Pass\" and \"To Surveil with Love\". The song played during the TV ad for the Ribwich is a parody of \"Like a Rock\" by Bob Seger, which is best known as Chevrolet trucks theme music through most of the 1990s. The title of the episode is a reference to the 1981 book \"I'm Dancing as Fast as I Can\", by Barbara Gordon. The stairs Lisa runs up are similar to the Rocky Steps. A reference to AC/DC is made when Otto asks Lisa to spell \"AC/DC\" and she spells it A-C-D-C, but after she finishes, Otto says \"you forgot the lightning bolt\" (referring to the band's logo). Homer following the Ribwich around with the Ribheads is a play on Deadheads, fans of jam-band music (the Grateful Dead in particular) who follow the band when on tour in order to see multiple concerts. At one point, Krusty the Clown says \"what a long strange product rollout it's been\". This is a reference to the famous line \"what a long strange trip it's been\" in the Grateful Dead song \"Truckin'\". The Ribwich is a parody of McRib and its promotions.\n\nIn 2011, Keith Plocek of \"LA Weekly\"s Squid Ink blog named \"I'm Spelling as Fast as I Can\" the second best episode of the show with a food theme, commenting: \"Spelling bee, schmelling bee. The star of this 2003 episode is the Ribwich, an obvious nod to McDonald's McRib.\"\n\n"}

While in Taiwan, the first season was under the title \"麻辣女刑警\" which means \"Spicy Female Cops\", but has followed the original Hong Kong title for the sequels.

It opened in 1964 as an elementary school and shortly thereafter added a middle school (in 1967) and high school (starting in 1971, with a 10th grade). From the start the school has had a strong connection to Israel and for the first two decades the school's 12th grade took place in Israel. The first high school class graduated in 1974. The school's early motto was \"The best of two worlds,\" which was later reworded as \"The best of both worlds.\"\n\nThe school's original name was Akiva Hebrew Day School. In 1982, the school was renamed Yeshivat Akiva-Akiva Hebrew Day School-Stollman Education Center. It is currently known as Farber Hebrew Day School-Yeshivat Akiva and uses the motto \"A foundation in Torah, a lifetime of success.\" The latest name change came as part of a major endowment by the Audrey & William Farber Family.\n\nThe school grew out of a March 1964 meeting, called by Rabbi James Gordon and Rabbi Hayim Halevy Donin, with 13 parents at the home of Mr. and Mrs. David Dombey.\nThe original trustees of the school were David I. Berris, Mrs. David Dombey, Rabbi Hayim Donin, Dr. Jacob Goldman, Rabbi James I. Gordon, Rabbi Israel J. Halpern, Dr. Max Kapustin, Ithamar Koenigsberg, Dr. Charles Levi, Seymour Ribat, Elliot Steiman and Phillip Stollman.\n\nThe first Annual Akiva Dinner was held on Jan 18, 1966 at the Bnai David Synagogue. At the tenth annual dinner in 1974, Abba Eban was the guest of honor and presented the school with the 1974 Spiritual Bridges Award of the WZO's department for Torah Education and Culture. At the same dinner, Rabbi James I. Gordon was honored for his work with the school. In 1984, Avital Sharansky spoke at the annual dinner.\n\nIn December 1974, Phillip, Max and Frieda Stollman dedicated a kindergarten building in the school. The kindergarten was a prefab building on the property of Young Israel of Southfield.\n\nIn November 1986, Mrs. Hannah Karbal dedicated the Elementary school, which then became known as the Karbal Elementary School.\n\nIn January 1988, The Sara Tugman Learning Resource Center for students with special educational needs was dedicated.\n\nIn 2001, the Schostak Family set up the Millennium Fund to boost the high school program at Akiva. The campus was subsequently known as the Schostak Family Campus.\n\nIn 2013, as the school approached its 50th anniversary, the school received two major donations. The William Davidson Foundation donated $2.25 million, for \"augmentation and improvement of Akiva's academic offerings.\" This was followed by the William and Audrey Farber Philanthropic Endowment Fund, which came forward with a 3 million dollar donation, which instigated a funding campaign and the construction of Akiva's first ever new facility. The Farber donation was later increased to $8 million and a new building was planned. Groundbreaking was in November, 2015.\n\nRabbi Manfred Pick was the first principal of the school, starting in 1964 and remaining at that post until 1970.\n\nRabbi Eliezer Cohen taught at Akiva from 1974 until the time of his death in 2014. He influenced several generations of Akiva students, teaching them Mishna, Talmud, and Bible. He was known for teaching the 6th grade class as well as the highest track of high school students. His yahrzeit continues to be marked by former students with days of learning.\n\nIn 1987, Rabbi Cohen and his 8th and 9th grade girls built a scale model of the Mishkan, which for many years was displayed.\n\nThrough 2018, and according to school records, there have been 562 graduates of Akiva. This divides into 274 men and 288 women. Eight are deceased. By decade, there were 84 graduates in the 1970s (38 men, 46 women), 124 graduates in the 1980s (54 men, 70 women), 100 in the 1990s (49 men, 51 women), 131 graduates in the 2000s (61 men, 70 women) and 123 in the 2010s (72 men, 51 women).\n\nThe largest class was in 2013 (26 students), followed by 1977 (25) and 2002 (24). The smallest class was in 2014, when there were no graduates, followed by 1994 (1), 2003 (2) and 1993 (3 - though no official graduation was held.) The most common class size has been 12 students, with an average size of 12.49.\n\nElisha Prero was the first Student Council president, elected in 1968. He was succeeded by Mike Feigelman in 1969, followed by Gary Torgow in 1970 and Sheldon Klein for the 1970-71 school year. Sharon Rose was elected president for 1971-1972, becoming the first woman to serve that role. Jamie Pearlberg was student council president in the 1991-1992 academic year.\n\nThe senior class annually produces a yearbook. The yearbook belonging to the class of 1991 was banned by the school. The yearbook was traditionally titled \"HeChalutz\" (The Pioneer), a name which lent itself to the school's basketball program for many years. However, the last yearbook which bore this title was issued in 1998.\n\nAkiva has often hosted a spelling bee. In 1969, Benjamin Micznik was the winner. The 1980 school champion was Sara Broner. Ephraim Simon won in 1986.\n\nIn 1969, four Akiva students participated in a science fair at Cobo Hall. Student Michael Feigelman was one of the victors. Judy Krakovits received an honorable mention. In subsequent year, winning science fair projects were displayed at the Cranbrook Institute. in 1974, Grant Mitchell won second prize in the Southwest Michigan Regional Science fair, and first prize in the Metropolitan Detroit Science Fair junior division.\n\nAkiva has participated in Bible Competitions, including the International Chidon HaTanach. In 1972, Benny Micznik and Joel Bigman advanced to the National competition in New York. Ira Finkelstein represented the school in the National Bible Contest in 1980. In 2008, Dovi Nadel came in 3rd internationally. In that same year, Elizabeth Goldmeier was also an international finalist.\n\nA mishmar program was initiated in 1972 for Thursday evenings. At first the program was voluntary, but in later years it became compulsory.\n\nThe students of the school have frequently put on plays for the public. In March 1973, they produced The Diary of Anne Frank. In 1975 students performed \"Tevye and His Daughters.\" In 1980, Akiva students put on \"The Importance of Being Earnest.\"\n\nIn 1982, student Shani Schreiber became a National Merit Scholar.\n\nFor many years, students in the school participated in the Invent America! competition. In 1987, kindergarten student Zevi Steinmetz won the national competition when he invented a Popsicle stick that caught drips.\n\nStarting in 1988, Akiva participated in the International Math Olympiad. Amy Zwas was the School champion in the first year.\n\nIn 2000, students in the elementary school began a yearly wax museum, in which students would dress up as famous historical figures. This was initiated by teacher Shirleen Pensler.\n\nFor many years Akiva has participated in the Southfield Public Library's Battle of the Books, winning on a number of occasions. The first overall victory took place in 1989, when Akiva swept 1st, 2nd and 3rd place. In 2012 a team from Akiva again won the competition. In 2013, an Akiva team won both divisions. An Akiva team placed every year from 2014 to 2018, winning first in 2014, 2015, 2017, and 2018.\n\nStarting in 1989, Akiva participated in the Israel Quiz Bowl, competing in the Day School division. The competition ran through 1993, with Akiva winning in the final year of competition.\n\nIn 1993, Akiva sent its first delegation to Yeshiva University's National Model United Nations (YUNMUN), and has been sending students to the conference ever since. In 1997, several students were awarded Best Delegate awards.\n\nIn 1997 students from Akiva began attending Panim El Panim, a four-day learning program in Washington DC.\n\nIn the 2000s Akiva students began participating in Eimatai programs.\n\nAkiva has had many sports teams over the years, though some were quite short-lived. The basketball team was known as the Pioneers, named after the school yearbook, HeChalutz. With the name change that occurred in 2016, the sports team took on the moniker Farber Fire. The early floor hockey team was known as the Cougars.\n\nAkiva's first reported athletic competition was a 1972 floor hockey contest against Yeshiva Beth Yehuda, played at the Detroit Jewish Center. Akiva won 9-5 before a crowd of 150. The floor hockey team also played against Hillel Day School and Windsor.\n\nIn 1973, sixth grade boys in both Akiva and Yeshivat Beth Yehuda formed a Shabbat observant baseball league and played against one another.\n\nIn 1985 Akiva organized a basketball team, which played against Beth Yehudah, Skokie, and the local JCC. Moshe Rose was the coach. The team captain in 1986 was Donny Ebenstein. in 1987, the school was invited to its first tournament, sponsored by HAFTR. Michael Selesny served as captain that year. That year also saw Akiva host an Israeli high school all-star team. Danny Najman was captain in the 1989-1990 season. Etan Berman and Zach Herman were co-captains in 1995. Ken Kohn became coach of the team in 1994 and served for over two decades in that role. He was replaced in 2011 by Rick Kaczander. The team frequently attends tournaments in New York, including at Yeshiva of Flatbush and Yeshiva University, and has also gone to Toronto, Columbus, and other locations over the years. In 1998 the team won the Tier III championship at the Y.U. tournament, captained by Erie Skoczylas. In 2013, the middle school team played against Hillel at the Palace of Auburn Hills during halftime of an exhibition game.\n\nIn 1989, the school hosted its first basketball tournament, the Akiva Invitational, consisting of four JV teams. Akiva's team was considered a JV squad as all seniors were learning in Israel. This tournament ran for two years, though the tournament trophy resided for many years in the office of the headmaster. In 2011, Akiva again hosted a basketball tournament, dubbed the First Annual Detroit Yeshiva Basketball Invitational Tournament. Teams from Cleveland, Pittsburgh and Columbus participated. The inaugural tournament was won by the team from Fuchs Mizrachi.\n\nA tennis team was started in 2009, coached by Bryan Weinstein. Practice takes place at Southfield-Lathrup High School and at the Detroit Tennis and Squash Club.\n\nFrom the inception of the high school, students were expected to spend time studying in Israel. At first this was done for most of 12th grade, after having completed an accelerated curriculum over the previous three years. In August 1973, the school's first 12th grade, consisting of Jonathan Freier, Sheldon Klein, Gary Torgow, Danny Schnipper, Jonathan Simon, Barbara Eskin, Michael Greenbaum, Benny Micznik, David Donin, Karen Polk, Judith Mermelstein, Lynn Dombey, Sarina Flatt and Solomon Pesis, left for Israel. The program was arranged in conjunction with the Jewish Agency. The girls were originally enrolled in an Ulpana in Kiryat Motzkin, but ended up on Kibbutz Tirat Tzvi, while the boys were in Tikvat Yaakov on moshav Sde Yaakov. The first class was present during the Yom Kippur War.\n\nAmong this first class, who had spent 12th grade in Israel, several elected to return to Israel for another year of study, going to Machon Gold, Keren B'Yavne, Hebrew University, the army-kibbutz Nahal program.\n\nSubsequent classes spent their 12th grade in Israel as well. The Class of 1976 marked the first cohort that learned in Akiva from 1st through 12th grade. The Class of 1977 had the largest number of graduates, at 22, and five elected to attend Bar Ilan University after graduation.\n\nIn 1990, the 12th grade Israel program was cancelled. This led to the entire class of 1991 leaving the school a year early, along with most members of the Class of 1993. Remaining members of the Class of 1993 were skipped a grade and graduated along with the Class of 1992. Again in 1994, only one student was enrolled for senior year. By the 1994-1995 year, however, the transition was complete a regular 12th grade has existed in the school since. Students were widely opposed to the cancellation of the program. Reasons given for the decision were that it became widely accepted among day schools for students to spend a year in Israel post-graduation, and that the Akiva students no longer attended the same schools in Israel, so it no longer felt like an extension of the class. The principal at the time, Zev Shimansky, also felt that students were suffering from the condensed academic program during three years of high school.\n\nMany graduates of Akiva choose to spend a year or more after graduation studying in Israel. The school also has a high aliya rate.\n\nThe original home of Yeshivat Akiva was in the Labor Zionist Building at 19161 Schaefer. The school moved from there to Young Israel of Oak-Woods, and then to the United Hebrew School \"Rohlik\" building at 21550 12 Mile Rd in 1971.\n\nIn 1980, having grown to 260 students, the school began negotiations to lease either the Annie Lathrup Elementary School building on Southfield Rd, or Southfield No. 10 on Berg Road. The school ended up moving to the former, and remained there until 1999. Reticence to lease the building to Akiva led to charges in the Detroit Free Press of anti-Semitism, but the Lathrup City Council approved the transaction unanimously. In 1984, Akiva purchased the building for $350,000. In 1990, the student council raised money to repair the school's old flagpole, which had been vandalized in 1985. In May 1990, the school was closed for two days due to vandals breaking in and damaging the school.\nIn the mid-90s, Akiva began to once again outgrow its building and began looking for a new space. One option was to move back to the UHS building. At the same time, the school ran into difficulties selling its existing property to developers, due to the building's historic status and a failure of the property to be rezoned.\nIn 1998, with the merger of Adat Shalom and Beth Achim, Akiva was able to move into the old Beth Achim building on 12 Mile Road, which took place for the start of the 1999-2000 school year. To celebrate the move, a parade was held down 12 Mile Road with the school's Torah scrolls. The school remains on that campus, though a new building was constructed in 2016.\n\nStarting in 1972, Akiva offered a summer day camp for ages 4–13. The camp was originally held at Congregation Bnai Torah.\nIn the 1990s the camp was known as Camp Ruach. In the early 2000s it was called Camp Akiva, and in 2010 it joined with the JCC's Camp Discovery.\n\nIn 1992, a uniform was instituted in Akiva, to strengthen an existing dress code. The uniform was approved by the board of directors on November 5, 1991 and polling showed an 80% approval rate among parents, though it was widely opposed by the students. \nThe dress code had called for girls to wear blouses with sleeves and skirts below their knees, while boys were to wear pants, collared shirts, kipot and tzitzit.\nThe uniform was eventually relaxed in the mid-1990s, and returned to being a dress code of a similar nature.\n\nBy 2011, the school had a uniform for the elementary school and a dress code for the upper school. This was done to allow students the ability to develop their own sense of style and to teach them to balance style with halachic demands.\n\nThe school has used a number of fundraising techniques over the years, including bingo games, flower sales, rummage sales, Chinese auctions and an annual dinner.\nIn 1982 the school filed for reorganization under Chapter XI, but was able to recover and continue operating, opening with 330 students in 1982. By March, 1983, the school had exited Chapter XI after a successful reorganization. Rabbi Moshe Tendler spoke at the dinner that year.\n\nIn September 1983, the teachers of Akiva declared a strike. Twenty-two of the twenty-six teachers picketed the school, while the remaining four teachers continued to work, aided by replacements. Issues at stake were seniority policy, job security and workload. Picketing teachers were accused of violence, and in return sued the school for libel. Picketing continued for nine weeks. By November 18, six teachers had returned and fifteen remains on strike. By the middle of December, those teachers who remained on strike were fired.\n\nIn 2008, Akiva students realized that some classmates were leaving the school due to tuition costs and organized a fundraising drive to create tuition scholarships. This campaign was dubbed Lead the Way, and supports tuition-based scholarships for Akiva students. It continues to run on a yearly basis.\n\n\n"}

Known as a \"Marja'\" (Grand Ayatollah), he was one of the well known Shia scholars of his time. His full name is Jamāl ad-Dīn Abu Manṣūr al-Ḥasan bin Yūsuf ibn al-Muṭahhar al-Ḥillī. We know of at least one hundred books written by him, some of which are still in the form of manuscripts. Muhammad bin Al-Hassan al Hurr Al- Amili in his work \"Amal al Amil\", p. 40, enumerated no less than 67 works of this learned author.\n\nAl-Ḥilli's name is as follows: His kunya was Abu Manṣūr and his first title was ʿAllāma “sage,” his second, Jamāl al-Dīn, and third, Jamāl al-Milla wa l-Ḥaqq wa l-Dīn. His given name was al-Ḥasan and his father's given name was Yūsuf.\n\nAl-Hilli also known as the sage of Hilla, was born in the still existent town of Al Hillah (in what is now Iraq), commonly viewed as the centre of Shia Islam when Sunni leaders were in control over Baghdad during his life. He entered into a prominent family of Shia jurists and theologians. His father, Sadid ul-Din al-Hilli, was a respected \"mujtahid\" and a leading figure in the Shia community. His maternal uncle Muhaqqiq al-Hilli was also a renowned scholar.\n\nHe studied theology and fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) in Hilla under the auspices of his father and his uncle, as well as other notable scholars, including: Ali bin Tawus and Ahmad bin Tawus. He also spent some time at the newly established Maragheh observatory, where he studied Avicennan philosophy and mathematics under Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, and was also introduced to the works of Fakhr al-Din al-Razi. Later, he travelled to Baghdad and became acquainted with the doctrines of Ibn Arabi.\n\nAmong his other teachers were Najm al-Dīn al-Qazwīnī al-Kātibī and Maitham Al Bahrani. He also sat with the Sunni scholars to study Sunni Fiqh. Like Al Bahrani and Nasir, 'Allamah-i Hilli was contemporary with the Mongol upheaval, and played a role similar to that of his teacher.\n\nAllamah-i Hilli was a prolific writer whose bibliography comprises about one hundred and twenty titles. Some of his works have been published, while the manuscripts of others have still to be found.\n\nAfter mastering philosophy, theology and astrology as a pupil of the eminent scholars of his time, he began a prolific career as an authoritative writer in his own right. Some 500 works are attributed to him, although only a few have been published so far. He moved to Persia in 705/1305, where he became most influential in spreading Shia Islam within Il-Khanid court circles.\n\nIn 1305, Al-Hilli emigrated to Persia, to the court of the Ilkhan ruler Öljaitü, whom it is believed he converted from Sunni to Shia Islam. As a result of his conversion, Öljaitü proclaimed Shia Islam as the state religion in Persia. Coins were minted in the names of The Twelve Imams. Both al-Hilli and his son, Fakhr ul-Muhaqqiqin were engaged in extensive theological and jurisprudential debates with the local Sunni scholars. Having impressed the Ilkhan, he was appointed to the traveling \"madrassah sayyarah\". Al-Hilli, however, eventually returned to his hometown and spent the last years of his life teaching there.\n\nAccording to some sources, Al-Hilli wrote more than a thousand works (including short treatises and epistles) on Islamic law, jurisprudence, theology and Qur'anic commentary. Of these, about sixty are still extant. Yet, only eight of these are published. They are “regarded by the Imami Shi'ia as the most authentic expositions of their dogma and practice”. The popularity and influence of his writings on later scholars are demonstrated by the large number of manuscripts and great number of commentaries written on them. He himself is the best source of information on his own works as he has recorded all of his writings up to the year 1294 in his biographical work \"Khulasat ul-Aqwal\" (\"The Summary of Opinions\").\n\nIn theology, Al-Hilli was clearly acquainted with the Basran school of Mu'tazilism, as his earliest writing on theology \"Manhaj ul-Yaqin fi Usul il-Din\", demonstrates. He was also deeply influenced by Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, and wrote a commentary on the latter's famous \"Tajrid ul-I'tiqad\". This commentary is one of al-Hilli's most widely read works, being the first commentary written on the \"Tajrid\" and thus forming the basis of later commentators understanding of Tusi's work. Also due to his work in \"Tajrid ul-I'tiqad\", Al-Hilli has been noted as one of the first Shia Imamiyyah scholars to use the term, \"ijtihad\" (i’tiqad) in the sense of “putting in of the utmost effort in acquiring the knowledge of the laws of the Shariah”. From this point Shia accepted this term.\n\nAnother of his most famous theological works is \"The Eleventh Chapter\" (\"Al-Bab al-Hadi 'Ashar\" - the title is an allusion to an earlier work of his, \"Manhaj ul-Salat\", which was composed of ten chapters), which he composed towards the end of his life as a concise summary of Shia doctrines for the learned lay person (rather than aspiring scholars). Judging by the number of commentaries written on it, and its translation into Persian and English, it represents his most popular work.\n\nHe wrote several polemical treatises during his time at the court of the Ilkhan. These were largely directed against Sunni, Ash'arite theology. In them, he was largely concerned with espousing and defending the Shia view of the Imamate and Mutazilite notions of free will (as opposed to Asharite determinism). He was also acquainted with Avicennan and Ishraqi philosophy. He wrote several works of his own, dealing with subjects such as logic, physics, metaphysics and mathematics. In general he is very critical of the opinions held by Islamic philosophers and sets out to rebut them whenever they appear to disagree with mainstream theology. According to the Encyclopaedia of Islam, “his services were so much appreciated by the Shi'is that soon after his death his grave in Mashhad became one of the centres of veneration for those who go on pilgrimage to the tomb of Imam 'Ali-al-Rida”.\n\nAl-Hilli's role in shaping Twelver jurisprudence is of great importance. As well as several works and commentaries on usul al-fiqh, he produced a voluminous legal corpus. Of this, two of the most important works are \"al-Mukhtalaf\" (\"The Disagreement\") and \"al-Muntaha\" (\"The End\"). \"Mukhtalaf\" is a legal manual devoted to addressing legal questions in which the Shia jurists hold differing opinions, whereas the \"Muntaha\" is a systematic and detailed exposition of al-Hilli's own legal opinions. He also wrote a summarized legal manual, \"Qawa'id ul-Ahkam\", which was popular amongst later scholars, judging by the number of commentaries that would be written on it. Amongst his later legal works is \"Tadhkirat ul-Fuqaha\", which is a legal manual intended for use by lay persons. He also composed legal works on specific issues (for example, \"Hajj\" or \"Salat\").\n\nOne of his works on the concept of the Shia Imamate (\"Minhaj al-karamah\") was criticized by the Sunni scholar Ibn Taymiyyah in his nine volume work \"Minhaaj As-Sunnah An-Nabawiyyah\". Besides various treatises on religious law, 'Allamah established a systematic version of the science of tradition (\"hadith\" and \"akhbar\"), based on principles which were later to antagonise the \"usuliyun\" and the \"akhbariyun\". In the \"kalam\" tradition, he left a commentary on one of the very first treatises to be written by one of the oldest Imamite \"mutakallimun\", Abu Ishaq Ibrahim al Nawbakhti, who died about 350/961. Similarly, he wrote commentaries on the two treatises by Nasir mentioned above, \"Tajrid\" and \"Qawa'id\"-commentaries which have been read and re-read, studied and commentated by generations of scholars. He left a summary of the vast commentary by his teacher Maytham al-Bahrani on the \"Nahj al-Balagha\". Using the methods both of a man of the kalam and of a philosopher, he wrote studies on Avicenna's \"Al-Isharat wa-‘l-tanbihat\" (\"Remarks and Admonitions\") and \"Kitab Al-Shifaʾ\" (\"The Book of Healing\"); attempted to solve the difficulties (\"hill al-mushkilat\") of al-Suhrawardi's \"Kitab al-talwihat\" (\"Book of Elucidations\"); wrote a treatise comparing (\"tanasub\") the Ash'arites and the Sophists; two other encyclopaedic treatises, \"The Hidden Secrets\" (\"al-Asar al-khaffyah\") in philosophical sciences, the autographed version of which is at Najaf, and a \"Complete Course of Instruction\" (\"Ta'lim tamm\") on philosophy and the kalam, etc. He casts doubt on the principle \"Ex Uno non fit nisi Unum\" (only One can proceed from the One), as his teacher Nasir Tusi, inspired by al-Suhrawardi, had done before him, and he concedes the existence of an intra-substantial motion which heralds the theory of Mulla Sadra.\n\nHis most notable works are the following:\n\n\n\n"}

He began his professional career as an actor in local television series, winning TVB's Best Actor award in 1999 and 2001. After 2001, he fully focused on film career and became one of the stalwarts of the Hong Kong film industry. In 2018, Koo was awarded the Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actor, Asian Film Award for Best Actor and the Hong Kong Film Directors' Guild Award for Best Actor for his performance in the 2017 film, \"Paradox\". Koo founded \"One Cool Group Limited\" in 2013. As of 2018, One Cool Group has produced 20 films. He was the ambassador of Hong Kong International Film Festival from 2014 to 2018.\n\nKoo is his family name. Louis is his English given name, as Tin-lok is the Chinese given name. Tin means “sky” or “day” , and Lok means “happy” in Cantonese. \n\nKoo's father was an actor and then changed career to a businessman. Koo was born and received education in Hong Kong. He is an alumnus of St. Teresa's School Kowloon and Carmel Secondary School.\n\nWhen Louis was a teenager, he made mistakes with his friends in a robbery case. Convicted by the court and sentenced to 22 months in the Correctional Services Lai King Training Centre. Louis didn't mention this matter after joining the entertainment industry. After being exposed by the media in 1994, he acknowledged the matter to the public.\n\nDuring 1992 to 1993, Koo was a modelling agent, sometimes he worked as a model for advertisements and karaoke videos.\n\nIn 1993, Koo signed as a contract artist with TVB (Television Broadcasts Limited).\n\nKoo started gaining wide recognition in 1995 with his leading role in a costume drama \"The Condor Heroes 95\", a popular series based on a classic wuxia novel. In 1997, Koo began sporting an extreme tan (for which he is well known for), which apparently enabled him to take on more contemporary roles. In 1999, Koo received TVB's Most Popular Actor Award for \"Detective Investigation Files IV\". In 2000, Koo received TVB's Most Favorite Character Award for \"At the Threshold of an Era ll\". Koo took a different approach to his role in \"A Step Into the Past\". This deviation from his usual cool aloof on-screen persona to a funnier, carefree and down-to-earth one resonated with the audience and widened his acting range. In 2001, Koo was given TVB's Most Popular Actor Award and Favorite Character Award Award once again for \"A Step into the Past\". He then went on an indefinite hiatus from television and has since focused on his film career.\n\nDue to the popularity of TVB dramas in the late 1990s, Koo amassed a sizeable fan base in Hong Kong, Taiwan, mainland China and South-east Asia.\n\nSince 1994, Koo began taking on roles in films, such as the paranormal \"Troublesome Night\" series and many action films including Wilson Yip's \"Bullets Over Summer\"(1999). Koo acted as a mute boy living on rural island in romantic literary film \"Sealed with a Kiss\" (1998).\n\nDuring 2001 to 2004, Koo signed contract with China Star Entertainment Group and starred in many romantic comedies, such as \"La Brassiere\" and \"Naked Ambition\".\n\nIn 2004, Koo took on the role of Sze-to Bo, a perpetually drunk and despondent former judo champion with hereditary eye disease, in Johnnie To’s \"Throw Down\" which was premiered at the 61st Venice International Film Festival. The movie was a marked departure from his usual commercial genres, and he also began his long-term collaboration with To and Milkyway Image.\n\nKoo later received international acclaim for his chilling performance in Johnnie To's \"Election 2\" (a.k.a. \"Triad Election\"), which was screened at the \"Out of Competition\" section at the 59th Cannes Film Festival (\"Election\" was competitive film at the 58th Cannes Film Festival). He won the award for Most Beloved Actor in the Hong Kong UA Film Awards 2006 through public voting for his role in \"Election 2\".\n\nIn a female perspective romantic film \"Happy Birthday\" (2006) adapted by Sylvia Chang from 'Rene Liu's novella, Koo portrayed a sensitive man who took care of ex-girlfriend after death.\n\nKoo also took supporting roles in action movies, such as Jackie Chan's \"Robin B Hood\" (2006), Donnie Yen's \"Flash Point\" (2007).\n\nHis character as an unscrupulous drug addict in Derek Yee's \"Protégé\" (2007) differed from his previous performances, as he forwent his suave image for an emaciated look. The supporting role earned him positive critical feedback and Best Supporting Actor nominations at the Hong Kong Film Awards and the Golden Horse Awards.\n\nIn Sylvia Chang's female perspective gangster film \"Run Papa Run\" (2008), Koo played a reckless triad leader who tried to shield his daughter from his past misdemeanours.

{"id": "2012377", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2012377", "title": "C.E.D'oh", "text": "C.E.D'oh\n\n\"C.E.D'oh\" is the fifteenth episode of \"The Simpsons\"<nowiki>’</nowiki> fourteenth season. It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 16, 2003.\n\nA sleepy Marge is too tired on Valentine's Day to have sex with an eager and well-prepared Homer, who dejectedly leaves the house. He sees a billboard for a school offering extension courses. He goes to the school and attempts to take a course on stripping for his wife, which Dr. Hibbert teaches, but is kicked out for hogging the stripping oil. By accident, Homer winds up in a different class that teaches strategies for workplace success.\n\nInspired by the lessons, he begins to investigate problems at the power plant and propose solutions to Mr. Burns, who rejects them all without reading them. Homer later overhears Burns state that he has made a canary the legal owner of the plant in order to avoid any consequences of wrongdoing. With help from Bart, he devises a plan to overthrow Burns by setting the canary free.\n\nHomer tricks Burns into believing that a team of inspectors is visiting to check conditions at the plant; when Burns is unable to find the canary, he panics and names Homer as the new owner. Homer's first act is to throw Burns from the office balcony, allowing a throng of employees in the parking lot to crowd-surf him into a waiting taxi. Burns and Smithers flee to Marrakesh, Morocco, intent on purchasing a large quantity of opium.\n\nThe responsibilities of running the plant soon force Homer to spend most of his time at work instead of with the family, and he becomes miserable after having to lay off employees and listen to business analysts discuss the plant's troubles. Burns visits Homer one night (informing him that Smithers has been sentenced to 80 years in prison for drug possession) and takes him to the cemetery, showing him the graves of people whose relationships with Burns suffered because he worked so much - including his wife. Homer decides to return ownership of the plant to Burns, who drugs him into unconsciousness and begins to wall him up inside one of the cemetery crypts. However, he is so slow and weak at building the wall that Homer easily steps over the few bricks he has laid after waking up. Leaving the plant in Burns' hands, Homer returns home to have a barbecue with his family and enjoy his old life again.\n\nThe live-action flipbook couch gag was actually intended for another episode but it was placed into this one instead. The couch gag director Mike Polcino hired a hand model to play the part of the animator. It was a reference to the way animators flip through recently drawn images to make sure the action flows properly. As the chosen couch gag is often dependent on the length of the episode, this relatively short one was placed into C.E.D'oh, a longer Simpsons episode than the one it was originally intended for.\n\nThe writers said that they did not want to watch characters \"walking around\" as it was not funny, and instead wanted them to \"go from joke to joke\". They however note that the entire act one closer consists of Homer wandering through town seeing things. They justify it by explaining that a \"sweet romantic\" mood is being built, and that a slower pace was needed.\n\nSteve Moore posed for the scene where Snake strangles inmate Terrance, only for Homer to misinterpret it as love.\n\nAnother suggestion for Dr Hibbert's stripper name that was pitched besides \"Malcolm Sex\" (which made it into the episode) was \"Christmas Buttocks\". In this scene, where Hibbert leads a \"Strip For Your Wife\" seminar on Valentine's Day, the team included regulars rather than Simpson-ised extras. This led to random cameos such as Cletus and one of the mobsters.\n\nEdwin Aguilar did all the animation for the Legoland sequence, yet he is not featured in the episode's credits.\n\nAccording to Al Jean, Matt Groening pitched the joke where Homer puts a blanket over Mr Burns after his failed attempt to brick Homer up.\n\nIn the episode, Lenny and Carl begin to fight each other with plutonium rods, simulating lightsabers. They fight over whether \"The Phantom Menace\" or \"Attack of the Clones\" \"sucked more\". The prank that is pulled in \"American Graffiti\" is parodied in the Itchy & Scratchy short \"Bleeder of the Pack\". At the end of \"Bleeder of the Pack\" Scratchy is involved in an airplane crash together with Ritchie Valens, Buddy Holly and The Big Bopper, which is a reference to the tragical plane crash on February 3, 1959. Legoland is referenced when Smithers says Mr. Burns has dumped nuclear waste under it for years. The scene where Ned Flanders stares at Homer and Marge at night from his bedroom window, in the dark with the cigar lit, is a parody of \"Rear Window\". The scene where Mr Burns attempts to brick Homer up is a satire of \"The Cask of Amontillado\" by Edgar Allan Poe. The episode ends with the theme song to the 1969-1972 show \"The Courtship of Eddie's Father\".\n\nThe head of the \"Successmanship 101\" seminar, played by Hank Azaria, is a parody of Alec Baldwin's character in the film \"Glengarry Glen Ross\".\n\nBart exclaims \"Look at me! I'm Tomokazu Ohka of the Montreal Expos !\" while playing baseball, to which Milhouse replies \"Well, I'm Esteban Yan of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays!\", referencing the relative obscurity of the two pitchers and their respective teams. The Expos would relocate to Washington, D.C. a year later and the Devil Rays would rebrand to the Rays four years later.\n\nThe episode title is a reference to the corporate position of Chief Executive Officer.\n\nOn IMDb, the episode has a rating of 7.2/10 from 319 users. In 2014, \"The Simpsons\" writers picked \"Bleeder of the Pack\" from this episode as one of their nine favorite \"Itchy & Stratchy\" episodes of all time.\n\n"}

{"id": "2012382", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2012382", "title": "Hymn to Intellectual Beauty", "text": "Hymn to Intellectual Beauty\n\n\"Hymn to Intellectual Beauty\" is a poem written by Percy Bysshe Shelley in 1816 and published in 1817.\n\n\"Hymn to Intellectual Beauty\" was written during the summer of 1816 while Percy and Mary Shelley stayed with Lord Byron near Lake Geneva, Switzerland. Percy Shelley sent a finished copy of the poem to his friend Leigh Hunt who immediately lost it. Shelley was therefore forced to create another finished draft of the poem and resend the poem. It was eventually published in Hunt's \"Examiner\" on 19 January 1817. The poem also appeared in the 1819 collection \"Rosalind and Helen, A Modern Eclogue; With Other Poems\" printed by C. H. Reynell for Charles and James Ollier in London and in \"Miscellaneous and Posthumous Poems of Percy Bysshe Shelley\" by William Benbow in 1826 in London. After the initial publication, Percy Shelley corrected lines 27 and 58 but made no other changes. A second finished version was discovered in December 1976 in the \"Scrope Davies Notebook\"; it was written in Mary Shelley's hand and contained many differences from the first published edition.\n\nThe shadow of a strange power floats unseen throughout the world, entering into man, coming and going mysteriously. Shelley asks this shadow, which he calls a \"Spirit of Beauty,\" where it has gone and why it disappears and leaves us desolate. Then he acknowledges that it is vain to ask this question; one might as well ask why rainbows disappear or why man can both love and hate, despair and hope. No voice from another world has ever answered these questions. The \"names of Demon, Ghost, and Heaven\" are the record of men's vain attempts to get answers to such questions. Only the light of the Spirit of Beauty gives grace and truth to the restless dream which life is. If the Spirit of Beauty remained constantly with man, man would be immortal and omnipotent. It nourishes human thought. The poet beseeches this spirit not to depart from the world. Without it, death would be an experience to be feared.\n\nIn his youth, Shelley sought spiritual reality in ghosts and the dead. In his search, the shadow of the Spirit of Beauty suddenly fell on him and filled him with elation. He vowed that he would dedicate himself to this Spirit and he has kept his vow. He is convinced that it will free the world from the state of slavery in which it is. He prays that this power will bring calm to his life, for he worships it. It has taught him to fear himself and love all mankind.\n\n\"Hymn to Intellectual Beauty\" is an 84-line ode that was influenced by Jean-Jacques Rousseau's novel of sensibility \"Julie, or the New Heloise\" and William Wordsworth's \"\". Although the theme of the ode, glory's departure, is shared with Wordsworth's ode, Shelley holds a differing view of nature:\nThe second stanza begins with the narrator addressing Intellectual Beauty:\n\nBut he is not answered, as he reveals in stanza three:\n\nThe fourth stanza reveals three values:\nShelley replaces the third of the Christian values, faith, with self-esteem, which signifies respect for the human imagination. According to the narrator, we have only temporary access to these values and can only attain them through Intellectual Beauty:\n\nIn stanza five, he reveals:\nThe words he speaks, possibly referring to Christian doctrines, brought him no response. It was not until he mused on life that he was able to experience a sort of religious awakening and learn of Intellectual Beauty:\n\nOnce he learns of Intellectual Beauty, he makes a vow, which begins stanza six:\n\nStanza seven continues with the vow:\nThe narrator breaks from the Wordsworthian tradition by realising that Intellectual Beauty, and not manifestations of it in nature, is what should be worshipped. The imagination, and not nature, is connected to truth, and the narrator realises that he should revere his own imagination and the imagination of others.\n\nThe first published edition varies from both the copy found in the \"Scrope Davies Notebook\" copy of the poem and the original manuscript draft in terms of language and philosophical view.\n\nShelley's understanding of Beauty as an ideal and universal aspect, as opposed to the common understanding of the word as an aesthetic judgment of an object, was influenced by his knowledge of Plato's writings. However, where Plato believed Beauty should be sought after gradually in degrees until one can achieve true Beauty, a process made possible through dialectic, Shelley believed that Beauty could also be found through its earthly manifestations and could only be connected to through the use of the imagination. The origins of Shelley's understanding of Beauty and how to attain it can be found within \"Hymn to Intellectual Beauty\". The poem's theme is Beauty, but Shelley's understanding of how the mind works is different from Plato's: Plato wrote (principally in the \"Symposium\") that Beauty is a metaphysical object existing independent of our experiences of particular concrete objects, while Shelley believed that philosophy and metaphysics could not reveal truth and that an understanding of Beauty was futile. Instead, Beauty could only be felt and its source could not be known.\n\nThe \"Hymn to Intellectual Beauty\" was conceived and written during a boating excursion with Byron on Lake Geneva, Switzerland, in June 1816. The beauty of the lake and of the Swiss Alps is responsible for Shelley's elevating what he calls \"Intellectual Beauty\" to the ruling principle of the universe.\n\nAlpine scenery was new to Shelley and unutterably beautiful. He was profoundly moved by it, and the poem, he wrote to Leigh Hunt, was \"composed under the influence of feelings which agitated me even to tears.\" Thanks to the Alps, Shelley, who had given up Christianity, had at last found a deity which he could wholeheartedly adore. The worship of beauty is Shelley's new religion, and it is significant that he calls his poem a hymn, a term used almost exclusively for religious verse. Later, in August 1817, Shelley read Plato's Symposium and his faith in beauty was no doubt strengthened by Plato's discussion of abstract beauty in that work and in the Phaedrus, which Shelley read in August 1818. It was daily intercourse with stunning beauty, not Plato, however, that brought Shelley to his new faith. Joseph Barrell, in \"Shelley and the Thought of His Time: A Study in the History of Ideas\", has shown that the \"Hymn\" is not Platonic.\n\nThe central idea of \"Hymn to Intellectual Beauty\" is that there is a spiritual power that stands apart from both the physical world and the heart of man. This power is unknown to man and invisible, but its shadow visits \"this various world with as inconstant wing / As summer winds that creep from flower to flower\" and it visits also \"with inconstant glance / Each human heart and countenance.\" When it passes away it leaves \"our state, / This dim vast vale of tears, vacant and desolate.\" Shelley does not profess to know why Intellectual Beauty, which he calls \"unknown and awful,\" is an inconstant visitor, but he is convinced that if it kept \"with [its] glorious train firm state\" within man's heart, man would be \"immortal and omnipotent.\" But since the Spirit of Beauty visits the world and man's heart with such irregularity, Shelley pleads with his deity rather than praises it. It remains remote and inaccessible. In the concluding stanza Shelley is a suppliant praying that the power of the Spirit of Beauty will continue to supply its calm \"to one who worships thee, / And every form containing thee.\"\n\nIn Stanza V, Shelley confesses that in his youth, while he was searching for spiritual reality, chiefly by reading Gothic romances, the shadow of Intellectual Beauty suddenly fell on him. He shrieked and clasped his hands in ecstasy. As a consequence of this experience, he tells us in Stanza VI, he vowed that he would dedicate his \"powers / To thee and thine,\" and he has kept his vow. The experience also left him with the hope that the Spirit of Beauty would free \"this world from its dark slavery.\" In this stanza, Shelley combined two of the major interests of his life, love of beauty and love of freedom.\n\nIn regard to the \"Intellectual Beauty\" of the title, Barrell remarked that it implies an approach by means of the mental faculties but that Shelley meant to convey the idea that his concept of beauty was abstract rather than concrete. His approach is romantic and emotional. Shelley, however, thinks of his Spirit of Beauty as personal, like the God of Christianity. He addresses it, pleads with it, worships it, but is using only the rhetorical device of personification.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2012395", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2012395", "title": "Maryland Route 404", "text": "Maryland Route 404\n\nMaryland Route 404 (MD 404) is a major highway on Maryland's Eastern Shore in the United States. It runs from MD 662 in Wye Mills on the border of Queen Anne's and Talbot counties, southeast to the Delaware state line in Caroline County, where the road continues as Delaware Route 404 (DE 404) to Five Points (near Rehoboth Beach). The Maryland and Delaware state highways together cross the width of the Delmarva Peninsula and serve to connect the cities west of the Chesapeake Bay by way of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and U.S. Route 50 (US 50) with the Delaware Beaches. Along the way, MD 404 passes through mostly farmland and woodland as well as the towns of Queen Anne, Hillsboro, and Denton. The route is a four-lane divided highway between US 50 and east of Denton, with the remainder of the route a two-lane undivided road.\n\nMD 404 was designated by 1933 to run from Matapeake (where the Annapolis-Matapeake ferry across the Chesapeake Bay connected the route to Annapolis), east along present-day MD 8, US 50, and MD 662 to Wye Mills, where it followed its current routing to the Delaware border. By 1946, the route’s western terminus was moved to MD 2 north of Annapolis, where it headed east across the Chesapeake Bay on the Sandy Point-Matapeake ferry. The western terminus was cut back to Wye Mills in 1949, having been replaced by US 50 west of there. The route was realigned to bypass Queen Anne and Hillsboro in 1960 and Denton in 1987.\n\nSince MD 404 is the main route for travelers between the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and the Delaware Beaches, the road has a high accident rate. To improve on this situation, the Maryland State Highway Administration is planning to widen the two-lane portions of the route into a four-lane divided highway. A portion of the road east of Tuckahoe Creek in Caroline County received $7.7 million for widening as a part of the stimulus bill signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2009; this section was widened in 2012. Widening on the remainder of MD 404 between US 50 and Denton was completed in November 2017. \n\nMD 404 begins at an intersection with MD 662 (Old Wye Mills Road) in Wye Mills on the border of Queen Anne's and Talbot Counties, heading to the east on Queen Anne's Highway, a two-lane undivided road. It heads east through farmland along the Queen Anne's/Talbot County border before reaching an intersection with US 50 (Ocean Gateway). This intersection has park and ride lots on the northwest and northeast corners. From here, MD 404 continues east through farmland with some residences and wooded areas as a four-lane divided highway, approaching the town of Queen Anne.\n\nFurther east, Old Queen Anne Road splits from MD 404 at an eastbound right-in/right-out intersection, with MD 404 crossing entirely into Queen Anne's County. It resumes east through some farmland before coming to an intersection with MD 309 (Starr Road). Past MD 309, the route intersects the northern terminus of MD 303 (Cordova Road), which intersects the route at a right-in/right-out intersection with the eastbound lanes of MD 404. From MD 303, the road enters wooded areas adjacent to Tuckahoe State Park, heading across an abandoned railroad grade owned by the Maryland Department of Transportation, before crossing the Tuckahoe Creek.\n\nMD 404 enters Caroline County upon crossing the Tuckahoe Creek, where it becomes Shore Highway. It emerges from the woods into agricultural areas, intersecting MD 480 (Ridgely Road) near Hillsboro. Past that intersection, the route heads through a mix of woods and residences before intersecting MD 404 Alt. (Hillsboro Road), where MD 404 heads into a mix of farms and woodland. Unsigned MD 485 (Saathoff Road) loops to the south of MD 404, returning to the route before the intersection with the southern terminus of MD 312 (Downes Station Road). The route continues to the southeast through farms, heading toward Denton. As the road approaches Denton, it heads through rural areas with some residences and businesses. MD 404 Bus. (Meeting House Road) splits from MD 404 to head through the center of Denton while MD 404 continues east to bypass Denton to the north.\n\nThe route continues east through fields before intersecting MD 328 (New Bridge Road). Past this intersection, MD 404 crosses over the Choptank River on the Governor Harry R. Hughes Bridge. It continues east as a limited-access road with a diamond interchange at MD 313 (Greensboro Road) and MD 619 (Sixth Street), where some businesses are located. MD 313 forms a concurrency with MD 404 and the two routes turn south, heading along the eastern side of Denton through woodland and then past residential neighborhoods. It turns to the southwest, heading into woods and intersecting MD 404 Bus. (Franklin Street/Gay Street) at an at-grade intersection. MD 313 and MD 404 continue as a surface road that turns south and heads through some commercial areas.\n\nThe road heads south into farmland, passing east of Martinak State Park. It crosses over Watts Creek and comes to an intersection with MD 16 (Harmony Road), with that route joining MD 313 and MD 404 for a three-way concurrency. The three routes continue southeast, narrowing into a two-lane undivided road that heads through a mix of woods and farms with some homes. The road turns more to the east-southeast, with MD 313 splitting from MD 16 and MD 404 by heading south on Federalsburg Highway in Andersontown. The road turns southeast and in a short distance, MD 16 splits from MD 404 by heading east on Greenwood Road. Past this intersection, MD 404 continues southeast through farmland and woodland to the Delaware border, where the road continues as DE 404, which runs east to an intersection with DE 1 in Five Points (near Rehoboth Beach).\n\nEast of US 50, MD 404 serves as part of the main route connecting the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area to the Delaware Beaches. MD 404 is a part of the main National Highway System for its entire length except for the portion from MD 662 to US 50 in Wye Mills.\n\nBy 1921, what would become MD 404 was built as a state highway within Queen Anne, from Hillsboro to a point between Hillsboro and Denton, and between West Denton and Denton. The state highway between Queen Anne and Denton was completed by 1927. By 1933, MD 404 was designated onto a state highway between Matapeake, where the Annapolis-Matapeake ferry across the Chesapeake Bay connected the route to Annapolis in Anne Arundel County, and the Delaware border southeast of Denton. The route headed east across Kent Island to Queenstown, where it turned southeast to Wye Mills and continued east through Queen Anne, Hillsboro, and Denton. By 1946, the route's western terminus was moved to MD 2 north of Annapolis in Anne Arundel County, crossing the Chesapeake Bay on the Sandy Point-Matapeake ferry, roughly where the Chesapeake Bay Bridge is now, and continuing west through Skidmore to MD 2. MD 404 was rerouted to bypass Wye Mills in 1948, with part of the former alignment through the community becoming part of MD 662.\nA year later, the western terminus of MD 404 was moved to MD 662 in Wye Mills. West of Wye Mills, the route was replaced by an extended US 50. The former alignment of MD 404 west of Wye Mills is now the US 50 approaches to the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, with the part between Matapeake and Stevensville now a part of MD 8. In 1950, MD 404 was rerouted to bypass Queen Anne and Hillsboro to the north, with the former alignment now Old Queen Anne Road and MD 404 Alt. A portion of the route between Hillsboro and Denton was bypassed in 1960. This former alignment of MD 404 is now known as Saathoff Road and has the unsigned MD 485 designation. In 1972, MD 404 and MD 313 were relocated to a one-way pair, eastbound Franklin Street and westbound Gay Street, through Denton. The routes previously headed south out of Denton on Sixth Street and Fifth Avenue. The former alignment along Sixth Street became MD 619 by 1978. In the early 1980s, construction began to widen MD 404 to a divided highway. By 1985, construction was underway for the four-lane divided bypass of Denton between MD 404 west of Denton and MD 313 north of Denton. In 1987, MD 313 and MD 404 were rerouted to bypass Denton along the newly completed four-lane divided bypass. The former alignment of MD 404 through Denton became MD 404 Bus. \n\nThe Maryland State Highway Administration worked on improvements to MD 404 in order to provide relief to travelers driving to the ocean resorts, notably by widening the remainder of the route into a four-lane divided highway. The primary motive behind the widening was the high accident rate that plagued the two-lane road, brought on by beach traffic. The divided highway portion of MD 404 in the Denton area was extended further in the 2000s from the south end of Denton to the Sennett Road intersection east of where MD 16 joins the route. The section between south of Legion Road and Double Hills Road was widened in 2005 while the section between Double Hills Road and Sennett Road was widened in 2007. This project received $3 million from the federal government in 2001. As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 signed into law by President Barack Obama on February 17, 2009, $7.7 million went to widening a portion of MD 404 east of Tuckahoe Creek in Caroline County, creating 221 jobs. The widening of this section was completed in 2012. On May 21, 2014, groundbreaking took place to widen MD 404 between west of MD 309 and Cemetery Road. The project to widen this section of will cost a total of $39 million. On June 25, 2015, Governor Larry Hogan announced that state funding would be allocated to finish widening MD 404 between US 50 and Denton, among other projects across the state. A total of $160 million in funds would go to widening MD 404. Widening of the section between west of MD 309 and Cemetery Road was completed in summer 2017. Widening of the remaining sections of MD 404 between US 50 and Denton was completed on November 20, 2017, with Governor Hogan in attendance for a ribbon-cutting ceremony.\n\nOn May 29, 2011, the Route 404 Memorial Garden, located near Denton, was dedicated, honoring those who were killed in car accidents along MD 404. The memorial consists of a flagpole surrounded by a circular path with bricks bearing the names of people who died along the route.\n\nMaryland Route 404 Alternate (MD 404 Alt.) is a long alternate route of MD 404 in Talbot and Caroline counties. The route runs along the former alignment of MD 404 through the towns of Queen Anne and Hillsboro. The route begins at an intersection with MD 309 (Cordova Road) near Queen Anne, Talbot County, where it heads east on two-lane undivided Millsboro Denton Road. West of MD 309, Old Queen Anne Road continues west to MD 404. MD 404 Alt. passes through woodland, crossing under an abandoned railroad grade owned by the Maryland Department of Transportation before coming to MD 303 (Lewistown Road). At this point, the route turns north to form a concurrency with MD 303 along Talbot Avenue, and the two routes enter Queen Anne as it turns to the east. MD 303 splits from MD 404 Alternate by turning north on Main Street, while MD 404 Alt. continues east past homes, intersecting MD 518 (First Street). As the road runs a short distance to the south of the Tuckahoe Creek, there is an industrial building on the south side of the road. Upon crossing the Tuckahoe Creek, MD 404 Alt. enters Hillsboro in Caroline County and becomes Hillsboro Road. The route continues through residential areas of the town. Upon leaving Hillsboro, the road heads into agricultural areas with a few homes and a patch of woods. MD 404 Alt. ends at an intersection with MD 404 east of Hillsboro.\n\nJunction list\n\nMaryland Route 404 Business (MD 404 Bus.) is a long business route of MD 404 through the town of Denton in Caroline County. The route runs along the former alignment of MD 404 that was bypassed by the divided, four-lane Denton Bypass. MD 404 Bus. branches off from MD 404 west of Denton by heading southeast on a two-lane divided road called Meeting House Road that soon becomes undivided as it passes through farmland with some businesses. As it comes to MD 328 (New Bridge Road) in West Denton, the route passes near residences. The road crosses the Choptank River into Denton, where it becomes Franklin Street. Shortly after the river, MD 404 Bus. splits into a one-way pair that follows Franklin Street eastbound and Gay Street westbound, with Market Street running between Franklin and Gay streets. The one-way pair, which has two lanes in each direction, carries the route through the residential and commercial downtown of Denton, with the westbound direction passing north of the Caroline County Courthouse. East of the downtown area, the one-way pair intersects MD 619 (Sixth Street). In the eastern part of Denton, the two directions of MD 404 Bus. turn south and join again, becoming a four-lane divided highway with the Franklin Street name that runs through woodland. MD 404 Bus. ends at MD 313 and MD 404 a short distance later.\n\nJunction list\n\n\n"}

His father, Levon Tariverdiev, was from Baku but a native of Nagorno-Karabakh. His mother, Satenik, was Georgian Armenian. He studied at the Komitas State Conservatory of Yerevan for two years and then graduated from the Moscow Gnessin Institute in the class of Aram Khachaturian in 1957.\n\nTariverdiev wrote over 100 romances and four operas, including the comic opera \"Count Cagliostro\" and the mono-opera \"The Waiting\". However, he is mostly known for his scores to many popular Soviet movies (more than 130 in total), including \"Seventeen Moments of Spring\" and \"The Irony of Fate\"—see List of film music by Mikael Tariverdiev.\n\nHe received many awards, including the USSR State Prize in 1977 and the Prize of the American Music Academy in 1975.

The most successful and best-known version was recorded by R&B singer Chaka Khan and appeared on her 1984 album \"I Feel for You\". It became the recipient of two Grammy Awards for Best R&B Song (with Prince as its songwriter) and Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for Khan. \n\nPrince originally recorded the disco song for his eponymous second album, released in October 1979. He uses a falsetto vocal with the melody range between C and C. Earlier however, the song and the later hit single \"I Wanna Be Your Lover\" of the same album, were given to Patrice Rushen, who eventually rejected both songs.\n\nThe Pointer Sisters recorded the song in 1982 on their album \"So Excited!\", and Rebbie Jackson recorded it for her 1984 debut album \"Centipede\". In 1993, Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake sang this song on \"The Mickey Mouse Club\". The song was featured on Jess Glynne's Take Me Home Tour in 2016.\n\nIn October 2019, in honor of the 40th anniversary of the album \"Prince\", the Prince Estate and Warner Records released a previously unheard solo acoustic demo recording of the song, with Prince also performing acoustic guitar.

The song also uses vocal samples from Wonder's song \"Fingertips\" (1963). The repetition of Khan's name by Melle Mel at the beginning of the song was a mistake made by producer Arif Mardin, who then decided to keep it.\n\nThis version of the song sold more than one million copies in the US and UK, and it helped to relaunch Khan's career. The song hit No. 1 on the \"Cash Box\" singles chart and peaked at No. 3 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart from the weeks of November 24, 1984 to December 8, 1984. The song remained on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for 26 weeks and became one of \"Billboard\"s five biggest pop songs of the year for 1985. The single reached No. 1 on both the US dance and R&B charts in late 1984, remaining atop both for three weeks each. In addition, the song also reached No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart. While touring with Prince in 1998 in support of her collaborative album, \"Come 2 My House\", Khan and Prince performed \"I Feel for You\" as a duet.\n\nKhan's version of the song is written in the key of G major with a tempo of 125 beats per minute in common time. Khan's vocals span from D to A in the song.\n\n\nThe first version of the music video for Khan's song featured her working in a club with female dancers. As rap music and breakdancing were gaining popularity in mainstream pop culture at the time, the song was released and proved a success, so another version of the video, in an inner-city courtyard setting, was created. It featured Khan with a disc jockey and break dancers Shabba Doo, Boogaloo Shrimp, Bruno Falcon and Ana Sánchez, all of whom appeared in the movie \"Breakin'\". A remixed version of the video was created to match the 12\" vinyl version of the single.\n\n"}

A correspondent of both Bede and Boniface, it was Nothhelm who gathered materials from Canterbury for Bede's historical works. After his appointment to the archbishopric in 735, he attended to ecclesiastical matters, including holding church councils. Although later antiquaries felt that Nothhelm was the author of a number of works, later research has shown them to be authored by others. After his death he was considered a saint.\n\nNothhelm was a contemporary of Boniface and Bede, whom he supplied with correspondence from the papal library following a trip to Rome. He also researched the history of Kent and the surrounding area for Bede, supplying the information through the abbot of St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury. Before his appointment to the archbishopric, he was the archpriest of the Saxon-built St Paul's Cathedral, London.\n\nNamed to the see of Canterbury in 735, Nothhelm was consecrated the same year. Pope Gregory III sent him a pallium in 736. He may have been appointed by Æthelbald, King of Mercia, whose councilor he was. Whether or not he owed his appointment to Æthelbald, Nothhelm was one of a number of Mercians who became Archbishop of Canterbury during the 730s and 740s, during a time of expanding Mercian influence. He held a synod in 736 or 737, which drew nine bishops; the meeting adjudicated a dispute over the ownership of a monastery located at Withington. A significant feature of this synod was the fact that no king attended, but yet the synod still rendered judgement in the ownership even without secular oversight, which was more usual.\n\nNothhelm oversaw the reorganisation of the Mercian dioceses which took place in 737. The archbishop consecrated Witta as Bishop of Lichfield and Totta as Bishop of Leicester. The diocese of Leicester was firmly established by this action, although earlier attempts had been made to establish a bishopric there. In 738, Nothhelm was a witness on the charter of Eadberht I, the King of Kent.\n\nBede addressed his work \"In regum librum XXX quaestiones\" to Nothhelm, who had asked the thirty questions on the biblical book of \"Kings\" that Bede answered. Bede's work \"De VIII Quaestionibus\" may have been written for Nothhelm. While he was archbishop, Boniface wrote to him, requesting a copy of the \"Libellus responsionum\" of Pope Gregory I for use in Boniface's missionary efforts. Boniface also asked for information on when the Gregorian mission to England arrived in England. This text of the \"Libellus responsionum\" has been the subject of some controversy, with the historian Suso Brechter arguing that the text was a forgery created by Nothhelm and a Roman archdeacon. The historian Paul Meyvaert has refuted this view, and most historians incline towards the belief that the text is genuine, although it is not considered conclusively proven.\n\nNothhelm died on 17 October 739 and was buried in Canterbury Cathedral. He is considered a saint, and his feast day is 17 October. The antiquaries and writers John Leland, John Bale, and Thomas Tanner all felt that Nothhelm was the author of various works, but later research has shown them to be authored by other writers. A verse eulogy for Nothhelm, of uncertain date, survives in a 16th-century manuscript now at the Lambeth Palace library.\n"}
{"id": "2012427", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2012427", "title": "Xavier Mertz", "text": "Xavier Mertz\n\nXavier Guillaume Mertz (6 October 1882 – 8 January 1913) was a Swiss polar explorer, mountaineer, and skier who took part in the Far Eastern Party, a 1912–1913 component of the Australasian Antarctic expedition, which claimed his life. Mertz Glacier on the George V Coast in East Antarctica is named after him.\n\nWhile a student, Mertz became active as a skier, competing in national competitions, and as a mountaineer, climbing many of the highest peaks in the Alps. In early 1911, Mertz was hired by geologist and explorer Douglas Mawson for his Antarctic expedition. He was initially employed as a ski instructor, but in Antarctica, Mertz instead joined Belgrave Edward Ninnis in the care of the expedition's Greenland huskies.\n\nIn the summer of 1912–1913, Mertz and Ninnis were chosen by Mawson to accompany him on the Far Eastern Party, using the dogs to push rapidly from the expedition's base in Adélie Land towards Victoria Land. After Ninnis and a sledge carrying most of the food disappeared down a crevasse, from the expedition's main hut, Mertz and Mawson headed back west, gradually using the dogs to supplement their remaining food stocks.\n\nAbout from safety, Mertz died, leaving Mawson to carry on alone. The cause of Mertz's death has never been firmly established; the commonly purported theory is hypervitaminosis A—an excessive intake of vitamin A—from consuming the livers of the Huskies. Other theories suggest he may have died from a combination of malnutrition, cold exposure, and psychological stresses.\n\nXavier Mertz was born in Basel, the son of Emile Mertz, who owned a large engineering firm in the city. With the aim of working in the family business, which manufactured textile machinery, Mertz attended the University of Bern, where he studied patent law.\n\nWhile in Bern, he became active as a mountaineer and skier. Mertz competed in several national competitions; in 1906 he was third in the Swiss cross-country skiing championship, and second in the German championship. In 1908, he won the Swiss ski jumping championship, with a distance of . As a mountaineer, he was particularly prolific in the Alps; he climbed Mont Blanc—the highest peak in the range—and claimed several first ascents of other mountains.\n\nAfter he attained his degree of Doctor of Laws from the University of Bern, Mertz studied science at the University of Lausanne; he specialised in glacier and mountain formations, for which he received his second doctorate.\n\nIn early 1911, Mertz went to London to meet with the Australian geologist and explorer Douglas Mawson. Mawson, who had served as physicist during Ernest Shackleton's 1908–1909 \"Nimrod\" expedition, was planning his own Antarctic expedition.\n\nIn his application letter, Mertz wrote that he hoped Mawson would be using skis, as \"they have proved so good for the purpose & knowing that I am as good as any one on skys.\" While Mawson was intending to recruit only British subjects (chiefly Australians and New Zealanders), Mertz's qualifications prompted him to make an exception, and hire the Swiss as a ski instructor. First, however, he was given responsibility for the expedition's 48 dogs, aboard the expedition ship , bound for Hobart.\n\nOn the \"Aurora\", Mertz met Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis, a lieutenant in the Royal Fusiliers. Like Mertz, Ninnis was responsible for the expedition's dogs; \"Aurora\"s captain, John King Davis, regarded the pair as \"idlers\". \"I wish we had some one on board who could look after [the dogs],\" he wrote in his diary, \"it is a great shame that they should suffer from neglect.\" On 2 December 1911, after final preparations and loading were completed in Hobart, the \"Aurora\" sailed south; she stopped briefly at Macquarie Island, where a wireless relay base was established, and reached the site of the expedition's main base at Cape Denison in Adélie Land, on the Antarctic continent, in early January.\n\nOver the following winter, preparations were made for the summer sledging. Because the conditions—constant, strong winds and an excessive slope by the hut—prevented Mertz from conducting skiing lessons as regularly as intended, he focussed instead on helping Ninnis to care for the dogs. On days when the weather was good they drove the dogs around outside the hut, teaching them to run in teams; when the winds returned the pair fitted and sewed harnesses for each dog, and prepared their sledging food. By this time Mertz and Ninnis developed a close friendship, as the expedition's taxidermist Charles Laseron later wrote:\n\nIn August, the preparations extended to laying depots; an early party established a depot to the south of the expedition's main hut—a grotto in the ice known as Aladdin's Cave—but returned without the dogs. Mertz and two others set off to rescue the dogs, but in heavy winds covered less than a mile in two hours, and returned to the hut. \"If it depended only on me,\" Mertz wrote in his diary, after four days' more wind confined them to the hut, \"we would be in our sleeping bags outside in the snow, and we would at least try to find the dogs. Mawson is definitely too cautious, and I wonder if he would show enough gumption during the sledging expedition.\" The following day Mertz was part of a party of three that made it to Aladdin's Cave to rescue the dogs; when strong winds confined them to the depot for three days they spent the time expanding the cave.\n\nIn September, Mertz, Ninnis, and Herbert Murphy formed a survey party, man-hauling to the south-east of Aladdin's cave. In strong winds, they travelled just in three days, before the temperature dropped to and the wind speed increased to , confining them to the tent. When a gap in the wind allowed, they hurried back to the hut.\n\nOn 27 October 1912, Mawson outlined the summer sledging program. Mertz and Ninnis were assigned to Mawson's own party, which would use the dogs to push quickly to the east of the expedition's base in Commonwealth Bay, towards Victoria Land. The party departed Cape Denison on 10 November, heading first to Aladdin's Cave, and from there south-east towards a massive glacier encountered by \"Aurora\" on the outward journey. Mertz skied ahead, scouting and providing a lead for the dogs to chase; Mawson and Ninnis manoeuvred the two dog teams behind. They reached the glacier on 19 November; negotiating fields of crevasses, it was crossed in five days. The party made quick progress once on the plateau again, but they soon encountered another glacier, far larger than the first. Despite strong winds and poor light, Mertz, Mawson and Ninnis reached the far side on 30 November.\n\nOn 14 December, the party were more than from the Cape Denison hut. As Mertz skied ahead, singing songs from his student days, Ninnis, the largest sledge and the strongest dog team were lost when they broke through the snow lid of a crevasse. Together with the death of their companion, Mawson and Mertz were now severely compromised; on the remaining sledge they had just ten days' worth of food, and no food for the dogs. They immediately turned back west, gradually using the six remaining dogs to supplement their food supply; they ate all parts of the animals, including their livers.\n\nThey initially made good progress, but as they cleared the largest glacier Mertz began to feel ill; he had lost his waterproof overpants on Ninnis' sledge, and in the cold his wet clothes were unable to dry. On 30 December, a day Mawson recorded that the companion was \"off colour\", Mertz wrote that he was \"really tired [and] shall write no more.\" Mertz's condition deteriorated over the following days—Mawson recorded he was \"generally in a very bad condition. Skin coming off legs, etc\"—and his illness severely slowed their progress. On 8 January, the pair about from the hut, Mawson recorded:\n\nMawson buried Mertz in his sleeping bag under rough-hewn blocks of snow, along with the remaining photographic plates and an explanatory note. Mawson staggered back into the Cape Denison hut a month later, missing the \"Aurora\" by a matter of hours; she had waited for Mertz, Mawson and Ninnis for three weeks until—concerned by the encroaching winter ice—Davis had sailed her out of Commonwealth Bay and back to Australia.\n\nIn November 1913, a month before the \"Aurora\" returned for the final time, Mawson and the six men remaining at Cape Denison erected a memorial cross for Mertz and Ninnis on Azimuth Hill to the north-west of the main hut. The cross, constructed from pieces of a broken radio mast, was accompanied by a plaque cut from wood from Mertz's bunk. The cross still stands, although the crossbar has required reattaching several times, and the plaque was replaced with a replica in 1986.\n\nThe first glacier the Far Eastern Party crossed on the outward journey—previously unnamed—was named by Mawson after Mertz, becoming the Mertz Glacier. At a speaking engagement upon his return to Australia, Mawson praised his dead comrades: \"The survivors might have an opportunity of doing something more, but these men had done their all.\" At another, Mawson said that \"Dr. Mertz was a Swiss by birth, but he was a man every Englishman would have liked to have called an Englishman ... He was a man of great feelings, generous—one of Nature's gentlemen.\" A telegram was sent on behalf of the Australian people to Emile Mertz, condoling him on his \"great loss, but congratulating you on your son's imperishable fame.\"\n\nThe cause of Mertz's death is not certain; at the time, it was believed Mertz may have died of colitis. A 1969 study by Sir John Cleland and Ronald Vernon Southcott, of the University of Adelaide, concluded that the symptoms Mawson described—hair, skin and weight loss, depression, dysentery and persistent skin infections—indicated the men had suffered hypervitaminosis A, an excessive intake of vitamin A. Vitamin A is found in unusually high quantities in the livers of Greenland huskies, of which both Mertz and Mawson consumed large amounts; indeed, as Mertz's condition deteriorated, Mawson may have given him more of the liver to eat, believing it to be more easily digested.\n\nThis theory is the most widely accepted, but there have been other theories. Phillip Law, former director of Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions, believed cold exposure could account for Mertz's symptoms. A 2005 article in \"The Medical Journal of Australia\" by Denise Carrington-Smith, noting certain sources indicating that Mertz was essentially a vegetarian, suggested that general malnutrition and the sudden change to a predominantly meat diet could have triggered Mertz's illness. Carrington-Smith adds a more hypothetical reason: \"the psychological stresses related to the death of a close friend [Ninnis] and the deaths of the dogs he had cared for, as well as the need to kill and eat his remaining dogs\".\n\n\n\n"}

St. John's previous indoor arena, Prince's Rink, burned down in November 1941, but the demands of the Second World War prevented the city from replacing it until well after the war ended. In 1948, a Citizens' Committee was established to raise funds to build a new arena to be named in honour of Newfoundlanders who lost their lives in that war. Fundraising went slowly until in 1954, St. John's City Council floated a bond to finance the facility, which then became property of the city. It officially opened in 1955.\n\nIt is the former home of the St. John's Maple Leafs of the American Hockey League (1991–2001). The stadium played host to many events, such as an exhibition game featuring the local senior hockey team, the St. John's Caps and the Soviet Red Army. It also played host to two NBA exhibition games and musical acts, as well as Pope John Paul II. Wooden bleachers were used throughout the building's earlier life, and plastic seats were installed later, towards the beginning of the stadium's AHL tenure. Memorial Stadium closed in 2001, replaced by Mile One Centre.\n\nThe interior structure of the building was later torn down, and in July 2006, after much controversy, construction started on a new Dominion supermarket. Coincidentally, the parent company of Dominion in Newfoundland, Loblaw Companies, converted part of Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, the former stadium of the Maple Leafs' parent club, to a Loblaws supermarket; both projects were approved despite grassroots protests.\n\nOn September 21, 2007 Mayor Andy Wells cut the ribbon opening Dominion Memorial Market. The converted stadium is unlike any other supermarket in Atlantic Canada. Some features include underground parking, escalators, and shopping cart conveyors. The store also retains the scoreboard from the stadium's days as a hockey arena.\n\n"}
{"id": "2012429", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2012429", "title": "1977 American League Championship Series", "text": "1977 American League Championship Series\n\nThe 1977 American League Championship Series was a five-game series played between October 5 and 9, 1977, at Yankee Stadium (Games 1–2), and Royals Stadium (3–5). The Yankees took the series 3–2, and defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1977 World Series to take the title. Kansas City was given home-field advantage as it rotated back to the West Division; the Royals held a 102–60 record to the Yankees' 100–62 record.\n\nThis was the second straight year in which the Royals and the Yankees squared off in the ALCS. The year before in the 1976 ALCS, the Yankees took the series in five games on a Chris Chambliss home run in the ninth inning of Game 5.\n\nThis series, they would again win it in their last at bat.\n\nEach game of the series was dominated by, mostly, hitting. However, the pitchers of each team held their own and it made for some exciting games.\n\nThe first game's matchup was Paul Splittorff (16–6) versus Don Gullett (14–4). Although the matchup seemed to not exactly be the classic Game 1 pitcher's duel, these two pitchers were the best of their profession for that season, although Gullett's was plagued with some shoulder injuries.\n\nThe visiting Royals jumped on the sore-shouldered Don Gullett early and never looked back. Hal McRae hit a two-run home run in the first and Freddie Patek had a two-run double in the second. John Mayberry hit a two-run home run off of Dick Tidrow in the third. Thurman Munson provided the Yankee runs in the third with a two-run home run of his own, but that was the only blemish on a pitching gem by Paul Splittorff. Splittorff went eight strong innings and Doug Bird closed it in the ninth. Al Cowens added a home run for the Royals in the eighth off of Tidrow.\n\nThe Royals had hopes of putting the Yankees down 2–0 going back to KC, and for a while that appeared possible. Beating new-found Yankees' ace Ron Guidry would be a tough task. The Royals scraped a run in the third when Freddie Patek drove in Darrell Porter with a sacrifice fly.\n\nRoyals' starter Andy Hassler had a shutout going for four innings, but Cliff Johnson broke the drought with a home run in the fifth. The Yankees took a 2–1 lead in the same inning when Willie Randolph singled, Hassler balked him to second, and Bucky Dent drove him home with a single.\n\nHard base-running helped the Royals tie it in the sixth.inning Patek led off with a double and Hal McRae walked. The next batter, George Brett, grounded to Graig Nettles, who threw to Randolph at second to force McRae. McRae, however, barreled into Randolph with a body-block, breaking up the double play attempt and enabling Patek to score the tying run.\n\nMcRae's aggressive ploy seemed to ignite the Yankees in their half of the sixth. Thurman Munson singled with one out off of Hassler, then Lou Piniella singled with two outs off of Mark Littell. Johnson doubled in a run and after an intentional walk, an error by Brett on a Randolph grounder allowed two more runs to score to make it 5–2. Randolph also had an RBI single in the eighth off of Little.\n\nMeanwhile, Guidry stymied the Royals, pitching a complete game and allowing the Royals only three hits and the two runs.\n\nAt Kauffman Stadium, Dennis Leonard pitched a four-hit complete game to give the Royals a 2–1 series lead. After a one-out walk and single, Freddie Patek's RBI single off of Mike Torrez in the second put the Royas up 1–0. Next inning, Al Cowens's groundout with runners on second and third and no outs made it 2–0 Royals. The Yankees got on the board in the fifth when Graig Nettles singled with two outs and scored on Lou Pinella's double, but the Royals got that run back in the bottom of the inning when Hal McRae hit a leadoff double, moved to third on a groundout, and scored on Cowens's groundout. Next inning, Torrez allowed a leadoff walk and single, then got two outs before being relieved by Sparky Lyle, who allowed a two-run double to Amos Otis. Next inning, George Brett hit a leadoff single and scored on John Mayberry's RBI double. The Yankees got a run in the ninth when Roy White doubled with one out and scored on first baseman Mayberry's error on Reggie Jackson's ground ball before Chris Chambliss grounded out to end the game.\n\nThis game was a barn-burner early on, with the Yankees precariously clinging to the upper hand. New York jumped out to an early 4–0 lead after innings on RBIs by Thurman Munson, Bucky Dent, Mickey Rivers, and Lou Piniella. The Royals clawed back in the home half of the third when Freddie Patek, having a fine series for himself, tripled and scored on a short fly ball hit by Frank White, barely beating Reggie Jackson's throw to the plate. George Brett tripled in a run in the same inning.\n\nAfter Graig Nettles singled in a run in the fourth to make it 5–2, the Royals got two more in their half. With two outs, Patek doubled in a run, chasing Yankee starter Ed Figueroa. White doubled in Patek and Hal McRae drew a walk off reliever Dick Tidrow. At this point, Yankee manager Billy Martin made a gutsy move, bringing in his ace closer and AL Cy Young Award winner, Sparky Lyle. Lyle was rarely used this early in a game, but Martin figured he was fresh, having only pitched one inning the whole series and, in Martin's own words, \"I wanted my best pitcher out there.\"\n\nBut, the move paid off. Lyle shut the Royals down for the remaining innings, allowing only two hits and no runners past second base. The Yankees added insurance in the ninth on a Munson sacrifice fly.\n\nIn order for the Yankees to advance to their second straight World Series, they would have to win again at the Royals' home park. To do that, they would have to beat their Game 1 nemesis, Paul Splittorff. Given that, Yankee manager Billy Martin decided to sit out Reggie Jackson on the grounds that he was 1-for-15 so far in the series and, in his own words, \"can't hit Splittorff.\" Paul Blair started in right field and batted eighth.\n\nThe Royals struck for a pair in the first when Hal McRae singled and George Brett tripled him in. Brett slid hard into Graig Nettles at third and Nettles responded by kicking Brett, which started a bench-clearing brawl. Yankees' starting pitcher Ron Guidry rushed in to defend Nettles. After order was restored, Al Cowens drove in Brett with a groundout.\n\nThe Yankees crept back in the third on a Thurman Munson RBI single, but the Royals matched that in the bottom half on a double by McRae and RBI single by Cowens with one out. Martin then pulled Guidry, who had gotten hurt in the first-inning brawl. Mike Torrez came in and pitched shutout ball over the next innings.\n\nThe Yankees began to claw back in the eighth. Right-hander Doug Bird relieved Splittorff after Willie Randolph led off the inning with a single. With one out, Piniella singled Randolph to third. With the \"unhittable\" Splittorff out of the game, Martin decided to send Jackson to the plate to hit for Cliff Johnson. Jackson put aside all frustrations over not starting the game and came through with a pinch-hit RBI single to cut the Royal lead to 3–2.\n\nThe Royals mounted a threat in their half of the eighth. Torrez walked both Amos Otis and Pete LaCock with two outs, but relief ace Sparky Lyle came in and struck out Cookie Rojas, the Royals' DH playing in what would be his last major-league game.\n\nWith apparently very little confidence in regular closer Mark Littell, who struggled in 1977, Royals manager Whitey Herzog sent Game 3 stopper Dennis Leonard out to preserve the lead in the ninth. Leonard, unaccustomed to short relief, yielded a bloop single to Paul Blair and walked Roy White (pinch hitting for Bucky Dent) with no outs. Herzog, going with percentages, replaced Leonard with another normal starter, left-hander Larry Gura. The strategy backfired as Gura gave up a game-tying RBI single to Mickey Rivers, with White reaching third. Herzog then brought in Littell, who retired Willie Randolph on a deep drive to center as White tagged and scored the go-ahead run. Munson was retired, but Piniella hit a grounder to third that Brett threw away at first, scoring Rivers with the final run.\n\nLyle then retired the Royals in the ninth, the final outs coming when Freddie Patek hit into a double play. As the Yankees celebrated, Patek sat in the dugout, dejected, for several minutes. (Coincidentally, it was Patek's 33rd birthday that day.) Tony Kubek, commentating for NBC, summed up: \"The Yankees know how to win.\"\n\n1977 ALCS (3–2): New York Yankees over Kansas City Royals\n"}

The finished picture, however, was greatly altered by commercial decisions on the part of the producers, and bore little resemblance to Savitch's biography. Screenwriter John Gregory Dunne, having spent eight years working on the script with his wife Joan Didion, later wrote a book describing his difficult experience, titled \"\".\n\nThe film was nominated for an Oscar in the category of Best Original Song for \"Because You Loved Me\", written by Diane Warren and performed by Celine Dion.\n\nSally \"Tally\" Atwater (Michelle Pfeiffer) is an ambitious, aspiring news reporter, who is hired by Miami local news director Warren Justice (Robert Redford) when she sends in a homemade audition tape. He carefully guides her career to new heights, all the while becoming increasingly attracted to her.\n\nTally soon rises through the ranks of network news to become successful, while Warren's once-stellar career sinks into mediocrity. Furthermore, Tally's ascension takes her away from Warren when she is forced to relocate to Philadelphia. Tally struggles at her new post, in no small part due to the hostility of veteran reporter Marcia McGrath (Stockard Channing), who jealously protects her position as the top reporter. Warren turns up to inspire Tally, and the two partners begin a new career together.\n\nHowever, on a routine assignment in a Philadelphia prison, Tally and her cameraman are taken hostage in a prison riot and forced to endure hours of intense violence. Tally covers the groundbreaking story from within the walls of the collapsing prison as Warren looks on from outside, guiding her through her first national broadcast. This incredible act of bravery leads to Tally's eagerly anticipated advancement to a national network newscaster position and the continuation of the dynamic duo's rise to fame - but shortly after, disaster strikes when Warren is killed during an assignment.\n\nUp Close & Personal Soundtrack was released by Hollywood Records on February 27, 1996.\n\n\nIn the spring of 1988, John Gregory Dunne and Joan Didion began writing the script for a film entitled \"Golden Girl\", based on Alanna Nash's biography of the late NBC News anchor and reporter Jessica Savitch and financed by The Walt Disney Company. When the film was finally released in 1996, eight years later, it was known as \"Up Close & Personal\" and none of the more controversial details of Savitch's life remained, including her alleged drug abuse problems that may have caused her to deliver an incoherent live news update on national television in early October 1983. Other details omitted from the film included the suicide of Savitch's second husband a few months after their wedding, and her alleged bisexuality, suicide attempts, abortion, and physical abuse by her longtime partner Ron Kershaw, a well-known news director who was the original model for the character of Warren Justice. Savitch's death at age 36 in an automobile accident (unrelated to drugs or alcohol) was also left out of the screenplay.\n\nAccording to Dunne, who chronicled his experiences dealing with studio executives in his book \"\", the majority of these changes were made in order to appeal to a broader mainstream market. Producer Scott Rudin was reported to have said, when asked by a weary Dunne what the film was supposed to be, \"it's about two movie stars.\"\n\nThe film currently holds an approval rating of 31% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 35 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10.\n\nCritics largely ridiculed the screenplay for bearing little resemblance to the biography of Jessica Savitch, which was supposed to have inspired it. Roger Ebert in the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" wrote: \"\"Up Close and Personal\" is so different from the facts of Savitch's life that if Didion and Dunne still have their first draft, they probably could sell it as a completely different movie.\" Anita Gates in the \"New York Times\" wrote that \"it all ends up more \"A Star Is Born\" than \"Network\".\" Leonard Klady in \"Variety\" described it as \"\"A Star Is Born\" meets \"The Way We Were\", and while discerning audiences will turn their noses up, the hoi polloi are apt to embrace this unabashedly sentimental affair and send it soaring into the box office stratosphere.\"\n\nDesson Howe in the \"Washington Post\" was extremely negative about the film: \"\"Up Close and Personal\", which was \"suggested\" by the Jessica Savitch biography, \"Golden Girl: The Story of Jessica Savitch\", starts out with relative promise... but then, the loooove comes through like a bad-news feed, and our marquee lovers undergo one of those unbearable montages. While an insipid, rock ballad covers the proceedings with auditory treacle, Cushion Lips (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Armchair Man (Robert Redford) walk together, laugh together, frolic in the waves with their clothes on - that sort of thing... In this movie, network executives - who depend entirely on focus groups, marketing and advertisers to inform their decisions - are painted as the moral bad guys, while Redford and the emerging Pfeiffer are the embodiment of integrity... And the fact that this is a Touchstone Pictures production - part of the marketing-obsessed, truth-sweetening Disney empire which just purchased ABC - is far too hilarious an irony to ignore.\" \"Time Out\" called it a \"soppy May–December romance masquerading as a deadly earnest issues movie... Blow-dried, bleached blonde-on-bland entertainment.\"\n\nHowever, certain critics argued that the film had its merits. Mick LaSalle in the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" wrote: \"Taken on its own terms, \"Up Close and Personal\" is a fine movie. Two star images meet and enhance each other. Redford, as usual, plays a rugged, outdoorsy, uncompromising man of unshakable integrity who just happens to be news director at a Miami station. Pfeiffer, as usual, is gorgeous, pretty, gawky and a lot tougher and smarter than she looks.\" Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars, arguing that the \"temptations are great to mock the clichés and melodrama in \"Up Close and Personal\", but the movie undeniably works as what it really is - a love story.\" \"Variety\" praised the \"chemistry\" of Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert Redford, and the \"delicious and brief star turns\" of Stockard Channing, Kate Nelligan and Noble Willingham, concluding that the film wasn't \"as accomplished as its inspiration but, regrettably, it's the best Hollywood has to offer in the heartstring-pulling genre.\"\n\nThe featured song, \"Because You Loved Me\", written by Diane Warren and performed by Celine Dion, won the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture or Television, and was nominated for the Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.\n\nStockard Channing won a Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Favorite Supporting Actress - Romance.\n\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n\n"}

(Contrary to the spurious \"Diary of Jean Laffite\", he was not the older brother of Pierre and Jean Laffite.) You may have joined the army of Revolutionary France as an artillerist. He served in the French Republic's artillery corp. In 1802 he accompanied General Charles Leclerc to Saint-Domingue to quell Toussaint Louverture's slave revolt. Yellow fever took the lives of many of the French soldiers including General Leclerc.\n\nAfterwards, Dominique You went to New Orleans where he joined Jean Lafitte and Pierre Lafitte and became the captain of the French corsair \"Le Pandoure\". He was nicknamed \"Captain Dominique\" by the French and \"Johnness\" by the Americans. He acquired a reputation for being very bold and daring. During the next few years he and the Lafitte brothers became successful smugglers in the Louisiana bayous. As privateers, they preyed on Spanish ships in the Gulf of Mexico, doing extensive damage to Spanish commerce. On one occasion, a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico caused severe damage to the \"Pandoure\" and almost killed Captain You.\n\nIn July 1814, Dominique You was falsely convicted of piracy in the Gulf, but the Americans failed to capture him. He was in the camp at Barataria when it was raided by American forces that year; he was captured and imprisoned along with other Baratarians. Jean Lafitte offered to help General Andrew Jackson defend New Orleans against the impending British invasion, in exchange for his crew and a pardon; and You was released. He was appointed commander of a company of artillery, which was composed of the Baratarians' best gunners. His men fought with such courage and effectiveness in the Battle of New Orleans on January 8, 1815, that they were mentioned in Major General Andrew Jackson's general order of January 21 as \"having shown uncommon gallantry and skill in the field.\"\n\nAs a result of this success, all charges against the Baratarians and Dominique You were dropped. After the battle, You settled quietly in New Orleans where he became a politician and supporter of Andrew Jackson. You died in New Orleans in 1830. He was given a military funeral, paid for by the public.\n\n\n"}

He is buried in Riverside Cemetery, Saddle Brook, New Jersey.\n\nGrade was raised Orthodox-leaning, and he studied in yeshiva as a teenager, but ended up with a secular outlook, in part due to his poetic ambitions. Losing his family in the Holocaust, he resettled in New York, and increasingly took to fiction, writing in Yiddish. Initially he was reluctant to have his work translated.\n\nHe was praised by Elie Wiesel as \"one of the great—if not the greatest—of living Yiddish novelists.\" In 1970 he won the Itzik Manger Prize for contributions to Yiddish letters.\n\nChaim Grade, the son of Shlomo Mordecai Grade, a Hebrew teacher and \"maskil\" (advocate of the Haskalah, the European Jewish Enlightenment), received a secular as well as Jewish religious education. He studied for several years with Reb Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz, the Chazon Ish (1878–1953), one of observant Judaism's great Torah scholars. In 1932, Grade began publishing stories and poems in Yiddish, and in the early 1930s was among the founding members of the \"Young Vilna\" experimental group of artists and writers. He developed a reputation as one of the city's most articulate literary interpreters.\n\nHe fled the German invasion of Vilnius in World War II and sought refuge in the Soviet Union. In the Holocaust he lost his wife Frumme-Liebe (daughter of the Rabbi of Glebokie) and his mother Vella Grade Rosenthal (daughter of Rabbi Rafael Blumenthal). When the war ended, he lived briefly in Poland and France before relocating to the United States in 1948.\n\nGrade's second wife, Inna (née Hecker), translated a number of his books into English; she died in New York City on May 2, 2010. \n\nGrade's postwar poetry is primarily concerned with Jewish survival in the wake of the Holocaust.\n\nGrade's most highly acclaimed novels, \"The Agunah\" (1961, tr. 1974) and \"The Yeshiva\" (2 vol., 1967–68, tr. 1976–7), deal with the philosophical and ethical dilemmas of Jewish life in prewar Lithuania, particularly dwelling on the Novardok Mussar movement. These two works were translated from the original Yiddish into English by Curt Leviant.\n\nGrade's short story, \"My Quarrel with Hersh Rasseyner,\" describes the chance meeting of a Holocaust survivor with an old friend from the mussar Yeshiva. The narrator has lost his faith, while the friend has continued to lead a pious and devoted religious life. The former friends debate the place of religion in the postmodern world. The character Hersh Rasseyner is based on Gershon Liebman, a friend of Grade's from yeshiva who built Navardok yeshivas all over France. Grade recounted that he had a short conversation with Liebman, and created this story on what he imagined Liebman would say to him if he had the words. The story has been made into a film, \"The Quarrel\", and a play.\n\nWhile less famous than Isaac Bashevis Singer or Sholem Aleichem, Chaim Grade is considered among the foremost stylists in Yiddish. His work is now hard to find in English.\n\nHis papers were very numerous and consumed much space of the apartment he shared with his wife Inna in the Amalgamated Housing Cooperative in the Northwest Bronx. The public administrator of his papers, Bonnie Gould, made requests to several institutions, including Harvard University and the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research to assist in cataloging Grade's papers. By the end of August 2010, the papers had been transferred to YIVO's offices, for sorting.\n\nIn 2013 the Public Administrator of Bronx County awarded the YIVO Institute and the National Library of Israel rights to the estate. In accordance with the terms of the agreement, the assets of the estate will be permanently housed at YIVO in New York City. Materials will be shared and made available to the National Library of Israel once its new building opens in Jerusalem in 2020. YIVO and the National Library of Israel have agreed to digitize the entire archive and make it accessible online.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The book's art is by Chris Weston, and depicts retro technology in \"British\" style.\n\nThe story is set in an alternate history where soldiers and operatives of the United Kingdom reached the German rocket installations at Peenemünde ahead of the U.S. Army and the Soviets, and brought all the key personnel and technology to Britain, in a mirror of the real world's Operation Paperclip. Thus is created the Ministry of Space, whose mission is to develop British space technology and establish a firm foothold in space for Queen and Empire.\n\nElements of social commentary are present throughout the book, as is typical of Ellis' work, while the drama of the story is found in the lives of the first pioneers of space exploration (as in \"The Right Stuff\"). This social commentary is disguised in a snippet of dialogue here and a background detail in the art elsewhere, relying upon the readers' own observations to bring it to light.\n\nOriginally intended as a three-part monthly series, \"Ministry of Space\" was first released in May 2001. Delays prompted the release of issue #2 in September 2001 instead of June. The last issue finally saw print in April 2004, three years late. No specific reason has been given for the delays.\n\nIn his afterword to the series, Ellis speaks of how \"Ministry of Space\" came to be, after he found in his attic a lost, forgotten copy of the \"Dan Dare\" comic \"The Man From Nowhere\", science fiction comics from the 1950s.\n\nThe narrative moves back and forth between the last days of World War II, the first few years of the British space programme, and the year 2001. The British had captured and relocated to England all the scientists and equipment found in Peenemünde, among them Dr. Wernher von Braun and the plans and pieces of the V-2 rocket bomb. Peenemünde and American advance troops are then (intentionally) obliterated by friendly fire, so that they cannot challenge the emergent British technological advantage.\n\nThe entire scheme is masterminded by Royal Air Force officer Air Commodore Sir John Dashwood, survivor of the Battle of Britain, who manages to convince Winston Churchill to establish the Ministry of Space and fund it with a \"black budget\". The following years see British pilots:\n\nThe story ends in 2001 and involves an American attempt to go into space, and their blackmailing of the British government concerning the secrets of the black budget that funded the Ministry of Space (which was derived from looting gold reserves from Jewish victims of the Nazi Holocaust). However, thanks to Dashwood's crimes, the British space programme has a manned spacecraft that has reached Saturn, thriving British Martian and lunar colonies, asteroid belt mines and at least three Earth orbital space stations providing the country with free solar energy. The unrepentant Dashwood dismisses the Ministry's outrage at its origins with the claim that England will not care about the truth when it has reaped such benefits from the programme. However, the price of progress is hinted at in a closing page that shows that the culturally static Empire practices segregationism; the black female pilot that flew Dashwood to one of the space stations for questioning is shown to be staying in \"Non-White Woman\" quarters.\n\nThe series has been collected into a single volume, in both softcover (March 2005, Image, , Titan, ) and hardcover editions (Image, March 2005, ).\n\nThe series won the Sidewise Award for Alternate History (short form) in 2005.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2012474", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2012474", "title": "Tiny Thompson", "text": "Tiny Thompson\n\nCecil Ralph \"Tiny\" Thompson (May 31, 1903 – February 9, 1981) was a Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender. He played 12 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL), first for the Boston Bruins, and later for the Detroit Red Wings. A four-time Vezina Trophy winner, Thompson was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1959. He was a member of one Stanley Cup-winning team, as a rookie in the 1928–29 season with the Boston Bruins. At the start of the 1938–39 season, after ten full seasons with Boston, he was traded to the Detroit Red Wings, where he completed the season, and played another full one before retiring. During his NHL career, he recorded 81 shutouts, the sixth highest of any goaltender. After retiring from playing, he coached lower-league teams before becoming a noted professional scout. Thompson helped popularize the technique of the \"glove save\" which was catching the puck with his hands as a method of making a save. A competent puckhandler, he was the first goaltender in the NHL to record an assist in 1936 by passing the puck with his stick to a fellow player.\n\nThompson was born in the mining community of Sandon, BC. He grew up in Calgary, Alberta, where his brother, Paul—who also became a professional ice hockey player—was born in 1906. As a child, he enjoyed playing baseball and ice hockey. Initially, Thompson was not a goaltender, though he agreed to play the position to get into games. As a teenager playing competitive ice hockey, he acquired the nickname \"Tiny\" as a joke, as he was the tallest player on the team, standing ; the nickname stuck with him for the rest of his career.\n\nThompson began his junior career playing for the Calgary Monarchs in 1919 at the age of 16. He competed for the Memorial Cup, awarded to the Canadian junior hockey champions that year, playing in two games and surrendering 11 goals, a respectable amount in that era. After spending the 1920–21 season playing for Calgary Alberta Grain, Thompson played three seasons in Bellevue, Alberta. In the 1924–25 season, he joined the Duluth Hornets, playing 40 games, recording a shutout in 11 of them. The following season, Thompson joined the Minneapolis Millers of the American Hockey Association (AHA). In his three seasons with the Millers, he appeared in 118 games, recording 33 shutouts with a 1.37 goals against average (average of goals surrendered in a span of sixty minutes).\n\nThompson began his National Hockey League (NHL) career with the Boston Bruins in the 1928–29 season after his contract was purchased by Boston manager Art Ross. Despite having never seen Thompson play, Ross had heard about Thompson's good reputation in Minnesota. In his first game, he posted a shutout, becoming the only Hockey Hall of Fame goaltender to accomplish this feat. In his first season, he appeared in all 44 of the Bruins' games, posting 12 shutouts and a 1.15 goals-against average, the second lowest goals-against average in NHL history to date, second to George Hainsworth's 0.98 GAA. Hainsworth set his record that same season. Placing first in the American Division, the Bruins had a perfect record in the playoffs en route to their first Stanley Cup victory, defeating the Montreal Canadiens and the New York Rangers. Thompson recorded three shutouts in the five playoff games, and allowed only three goals.\n\nThe following season, Thompson again appeared in all of the Bruins' 44 games, posting three shutouts and a 2.19 goals-against average. The league changed its rules on forward passing, which resulted in a sharp increase in goalscoring. Boston won all but six games, finishing with a 38–5–1 record, the best winning percentage for any team in a season. Surrendering only 98 goals, Thompson bested Chicago goaltender Charlie Gardiner to win the first of his four Vezina Trophies. The Vezina Trophy is awarded to the league's top goaltender, which was determined prior to the 1981–82 season by number of goals surrendered by goaltenders who had played a minimum number of games. In the playoffs, however, they suffered their first two-game losing streak, as they were swept 2–0 by the Canadiens in the Stanley Cup finals. Earlier in the playoffs, Thompson's winning streak of seven playoff games was snapped; it remains, as of 2014, the longest playoff winning streak to start a career.\n\nIn the 1930–31 season, he played all 44 games again, and was named to the Second All-Star team. In the playoffs, Boston lost the semifinals to the Montreal Canadiens; during game two of the series Thompson became the first goaltender to be pulled for a sixth attacker at the end of a game to give his team a higher chance to score a goal. Even though Boston still lost, coach Art Ross' maneuver was described as \"amazing\" the following day, and this technique, known as \"open net\", caught on with the rest of the league.\n\nThe Bruins missed the playoffs for the first time in Thompson's career in the 1931–32 season. He won only 13 games while appearing in 43 out of Boston's 48 games, which was the only time he missed games as a member of the Bruins. The next season, Boston made the playoffs once more, losing to the Toronto Maple Leafs. The final game of the playoff series was described as Thompson's most memorable. During that game, Toronto and Boston were tied after regulation time and over 100 minutes of overtime proceeded, with Thompson dueling Toronto's goaltender Lorne Chabot. After the end of the fifth overtime period, managers Conn Smythe of the Maple Leafs and Art Ross of the Bruins asked league president Frank Calder to suspend the game, but Calder refused. Early in the sixth overtime period, a pass from Boston defenseman Eddie Shore was intercepted, and Ken Doraty skated in on a breakaway, cleanly beating Thompson at 4:46 of the period. The losing goaltender in the second-longest NHL game, Thompson received a standing ovation from fans at the Maple Leaf Gardens. Thompson finished the playoff series with 1.23 goals-against average, despite a losing record.\n\nThompson became the second goaltender to win his second Vezina Trophy in 1932–33 since its inception in the 1926–27 season, as he recorded 11 shutouts and a 1.76 goals-against average. After missing the playoffs in the 1933–34 season, they rebounded to first place in the American Division the following season, as Thompson was named to the Second All-Star team for the second time. In the playoffs, the Bruins won only one of their four games; their only win was on the strength of Thompson's shutout, who finished the playoffs with a 1.53 goals-against average.\n\nIn the 1935–36 NHL season, Thompson recorded 10 shutouts, but Boston managed to win only 22 out of their 48 games. During the season, he recorded an assist, a rarity for goaltenders. At the end of the season, he was named to the First All-Star team for the first time, and won the Vezina Trophy for the third time, tying George Hainsworth's all-time mark with three victories. The ensuing two-game, total-goal playoff series against the Toronto Maple Leafs was a series of contrasts, as the Bruins lost 8–6. In the opening game, the Bruins shut out Toronto 3–0, while they lost the other game 8–3. In 1937–38, his final full season with the Bruins, he won 30 out of the 48 games, but Boston lost to the Maple Leafs once again in the playoffs. Thompson set a new record by winning his fourth and final Vezina Trophy. He was also named to the First All-Star team for the second time.\n\nWhen Thompson left the Bruins, he had compiled 252 wins. This record stood for 81 years, until it was surpassed by Tuukka Rask.\n\nThompson appeared in only five games for the Bruins in the 1938–39 season, as Boston decided to replace the aging goaltender with the substantially younger Frank Brimsek who was 12 years his junior. Brimsek would go on to lead the Bruins to a Stanley Cup victory that season, earning the nickname \"Mister Zero\" while picking up 10 regular season shutouts, the Vezina Trophy, First All-Star Team honours, and the Calder Memorial Trophy, which is given \"to the player selected as the most proficient in his first year of competition\". To make space for Brimsek, Thompson was traded to the Detroit Red Wings for Normie Smith and $15,000 on November 16, 1938; Thompson also received a $1,000 bonus from Boston.\n\nBoston manager Art Ross predicted that Thompson, now 35, would play for the Red Wings for at least another five seasons; however, Thompson remained with the team for only two seasons before retiring from playing. The Red Wings posted a losing record in both of these seasons, although they made the playoffs both times. Overall, Thompson appeared in 85 regular season games for Detroit, recording a 32–41–12 record, seven shutouts, and a 2.54 goals-against average, and in 11 playoff games, posting a 5–6, with one shutout and a 2.41 goal-against average.\n\nAfter retiring from professional play, Thompson became the head coach of the Buffalo Bisons of the American Hockey League (AHL) in the 1940–41 season. He coached 56 games in two seasons. The Bisons missed the playoffs both times. He appeared in one game as goaltender in the 1940–41 season. During World War II, Thompson served in the Royal Canadian Air Force and doubled as the coach of the Calgary RCAF Mustangs of the Alberta Senior Hockey League. He led the Mustangs to the league championship series in 1942–43 against the Calgary Currie Army team where injuries to the Mustangs' goaltenders brought him back onto the ice in March 1943. With Thompson in goal, the Mustangs defeated Currie Army 8–4 to tie the best-of-five series at two wins apiece. He played the deciding game, but his team fell short of winning the Alberta title with a 3–1 loss to Currie Army. After the war, Thompson became chief Western Canada scout for the Chicago Black Hawks. He was one of the few scouts at the time who sought to discover a player's personality along with their playing ability. Thompson often conversed with players as part of an effort to learn about the players he was watching.\n\nThompson was a stand-up goaltender, rarely falling on both knees to stop a puck. He was one of the first NHL goaltenders to catch the puck with his hand to make a save, and helped popularize the technique. Using gloves that were smaller than those of other players, he was among the best puck-catchers of his era. He stood in the way of the puck with minimal padding, risking being struck when moving to catch it instead of simply deflecting it away from the net. His signature technique, very often featured in photographs of him, involved dropping to one knee with the paddle of his goalstick covering the five-hole, and extending his glove to cover the left side of the net. Although he caught the puck with his glove, he did so without gloves resembling the modern blocker and trapper glove combination. Thompson was described by Johnny Bower, a former goaltender who was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, as a good puckhandler, and one of the best of his time at forward passing. In the 1935–36 season, Thompson became the first goaltender to get an assist by intentionally passing the puck with his stick to a fellow player.\n\nThompson's points percentage in a season of .875, recorded in the 1929–30 season, still remains a record. His 38 wins during that season was a Boston record that was eclipsed only in the 1982–83 season, by Pete Peeters (who won 40 of 62 games played); since then, no Bruins goaltender has had more than 37 wins in a season. Thompson is the all-time Bruins leader for shutouts and goals-against average. Thompson held the records for most games played (468) and wins (252) by a Bruins goaltender until 2019, when both records were surpassed by Tuukka Rask. Throughout his entire NHL career, Thompson accrued 81 shutouts, which is sixth all-time in NHL history, and was second to only George Hainsworth (who had 94) when Thompson retired. He also posted seven shutouts in the playoffs. He is fifth all-time in goals-against average, allowing on average only 2.08 per a 60-minute span. He led all goaltenders in regular season games played 10 times, and in regular season wins five times.\n\nIn 1959, Thompson was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. He died in Calgary on February 9, 1981. He was survived by his wife, Edith, and his daughter, Sandra.\n\n"}

The office is also alternatively known as Prime Minister of North Korea. The current premier is Kim Jae-ryong.\n\nOriginally, under the 1948 Constitution of the DPRK, the Premier was the highest state post in North Korea. Kim Il-sung himself inaugurated the post, keeping it for 24 years until 1972, while the ceremonial role of the head of State rested in the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly.\n\nThe 1972 Constitution created the post of President of the DPRK, which replaced the premiership as the top state post. The executive presidency was created with Kim in mind, and he transferred to that post soon after the Constitution was promulgated. The Premier was now the head of the Administration Council, but most of the powers of the former cabinet were passed to the Central People's Committee, the highest ruling council chaired by the president himself. The first premier after Kim Il-sung was his long-time ally Kim Il. The post was then officially known as \"Premier of the Administration Council\" (정무원 총리, \"jungmuwon chongni\").\n\nAfter Kim Il-sung died, the post of president remained vacant (officially Kim Il-sung was proclaimed Eternal President) as Kim Jong-il planned a new State reorganization. A constitution revision in 1998 abolished both the Central People's Committee and the Administration Council, re-creating the Cabinet.\n\nThe Premier represents and oversees the cabinet, which is charged with executing the policies decided by the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea. The office has no policy-making authority of its own.\n\nThe Premier is nominally part of a triumvirate overseeing North Korea's executive branch, alongside the President of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly (i.e. the head of State) and the Chairman of the State Affairs Commission (i.e., the commander-in-chief). In practice, however, the SAC chairman, which is constitutionally defined as \"the highest post in the state,\" exercises absolute control over the government and the country.\n\nAccording to the constitution of the DPRK, the SAC chairman, SPA Presidium president and Premier have powers equivalent to one-third of those of a president's powers in most presidential systems. The SPA presidium chairman conducts foreign relations, the premier handles domestic matters and heads the government, and the SAC chairman (known as the chairman of the National Defence Commission before 2016) commands the armed forces. However, the Premier ranks as the lowest of the three: significantly, Kim Jong-il was NDC Chairman without interruption from 1993 until 2011, and Kim Yong-nam was President of the SPA Presidium from 1998 to 2019, while there have been six premiers since Kim Il-sung's death.\n\nThe following is a list of premiers of North Korea since its founding in 1948.\n\nThe First Vice Premier of the Cabinet is the designation for the most senior Vice Premier.\n\nThe Premier is represented by a number of vice premiers, who act as a high-ranking executive assistant to the Premier.\n\n"}

It is depicted as an archetypal American suburban community, inhabited largely by white Americans and the middle class, as befitting the socioeconomic outlook of the United States at the time. According to the episode \"Hey Hey What Can I Do,\" Point Place's economy seems to be largely built around slaughtering (in fact, a later episode \"Leaving Home Ain't Easy\" reveals a roadway named \"Slaughterhouse Way\" because it leads to a slaughterhouse).\n\nOver the course of the series, Point Place is depicted as a population center gradually evolving from an industrial town into a growing suburban city during the economic downturn of the mid-to-late 1970s. During the period between 1976 and 1980, small, locally owned businesses are forced to close as aggressive chain stores move in and rust-belt factories are shut down due to the fall in consumer demand. Other closings include the auto parts manufacturing plant (where Red Forman was a supervisor), a local appliance and electronics store, Bargain Bob's (owned and operated by Bob Pinciotti), the local Foto Hut chain (owned by Leo), and the Forman & Son muffler and auto repair shop (itself built in a former local muffler business). In their stead, large chain stores such as Price Mart and Muffler Master (which purchased the Forman & Son business) moved in and opened. During the eighth and final season, in contravention to this trend, the William Barnett-owned music chain Grooves is sold and closed, with the sole remaining store becoming the privately owned business of Barnett’s son, Steven Hyde.\n\nThe town is depicted as a somewhat rich town. Though Jackie thinks it looks like Paris (to which Donna replies \"No wonder you think Kelso could be a model!\"), the town is often verbally bashed by numerous characters throughout the series.\n\nThe \"FAQ\" on the program's official website says, \"Point Place is a fictional suburb of Green Bay, Wisconsin. This is why many Wisconsinites may recognize names of towns such as Kenosha. In reality, the location of Point Place has no basis in actual Wisconsin geography. There is an episode where the gang travels \"down\" to Kenosha to go to a movie.\" This seemed to be directly contradicted by concrete information given in several episodes, such as the fact in one episode (\"The Velvet Rope\") it was possible to drive to Chicago, attend a party, and drive back in the course of a few hours; in another episode, Kelso explicitly states that Chicago is a two-hour drive from Point Place, consistent with the theory of a Kenosha-area location. Over the course of the series, many other local businesses and events were identified as being in or taking place in Kenosha (which is actually from Green Bay). The name Point Place was chosen for the town because co-creator Bonnie Turner is from Toledo, Ohio where there is a section of town called Point Place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2012490", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2012490", "title": "Russian culture", "text": "Russian culture\n\nThe culture of the ethnic Russian people (along with the cultures of many other ethnicities with which it has intertwined in the territory of the Russian Federation) has a long tradition of achievement in many fields, especially when it comes to literature, folk dancing, philosophy, classical music, traditional folk music, ballet, architecture, painting, cinema, animation and politics, which all have had considerable influence on world culture. Russia also has a rich material culture and a tradition in technology.\n\nRussian culture grew from that of the East Slavs, with their pagan beliefs and specific way of life in the wooded, steppe and forest-steppe areas of Eastern Europe and Eurasia. Early Russian culture and Slavic people in Russia were much influenced by nomadic Turkic people (Tatars, Kipchaks) and tribes of Iranian origin through intense cultural contacts in the Russian steppe and strongly by Finno-Ugric, Balts and Scandinavians (Germanic people) through the Russian North, as well as by the people of the Byzantine Empire (especially Greeks) with which Old Russia maintained strong cultural links. In the late 1st millennium AD the Nordic sea culture of the Varangians (Scandinavian Vikings) and in the middle of the second millennium the nomadic people of the Mongol Empire also influenced the Russian culture. Early Slavic tribes in European Russia were much shaped by the fusion of Nordic-European and Oriental-Asian cultures which formed Russian identity in the Volga region and in the states of Rus' Khaganate and Kievan Rus'. Orthodox Christian missionaries began arriving from the Eastern Roman Empire in the 9th century, and Kievan Rus' officially converted to Orthodox Christianity in 988. This largely defined the Russian culture of the next millennium as a synthesis of Slavic and Byzantine cultures. Russia or Rus' was formed, developed its culture and was influenced through its location by Western European and Asian cultures so that a Russian-Eurasian culture developed.\n\nAfter Constantinople fell to the Ottomans in 1453, Russia remained the largest Orthodox nation in the world and eventually claimed succession to the Byzantine legacy in the form of the Third Rome idea. An important period in Russian history was the Tsardom of Russia from 1547 until 1721 where many Russian cultural peculiarities emerged and developed. At different periods in Russian history, the culture of Western Europe also exerted strong influences over Russian citizens. During the era of the Russian Empire which existed from 1721 to 1917, the Tsar's title was abolished and the rulers of Russia were called Emperors. Since the reforms of Peter the Great (reigned 1682–1725) in the Russian Empire, for two centuries Russian culture largely developed in the general context of European culture rather than pursuing its own unique ways. The situation changed in the 20th century, when the distinctive Communist ideology imported from Europe became a major factor in the culture of the Soviet Union, where Russia, in the form of the Russian SFSR, was the largest and leading part. The culture of the Soviet Union has decisively shaped the former Soviet Russian Republic and thus Russian culture.\n\nAlthough Russia has been influenced by Western Europe, the Eastern world, Northern cultures and the Byzantine Empire for more than 1000 years since ancient Rus' and is culturally connected with them, it is often argued that due to its history, geography and inhabitants which belong to different language families but were embedded in the Russian language and culture, the country has developed a character with many aspects of a unique Russian civilization which in many parts differs from both Western and Eastern cultures.\n\nNowadays, the Nation Brands Index ranks Russian cultural heritage seventh, based on interviews of some 20,000 people mainly from Western countries and from the Far East. Due to the relatively late involvement of Russia in modern globalization and in international tourism, many aspects of Russian culture, like Russian jokes and Russian art, remain largely unknown to foreigners.\n\nRussia's 160 ethnic groups speak some 100 languages. According to the 2002 census, 142.6 million people speak Russian, followed by Tatar with 5.3 million and Ukrainian with 1.8 million speakers. Russian is the only official state language, but the Constitution gives the individual republics the right to make their native language co-official next to Russian. Despite its wide dispersal, the Russian language is homogeneous throughout Russia. Russian is the most geographically widespread language of Eurasia and the most widely spoken Slavic language. Russian belongs to the Indo-European language family and is one of the living members of the East Slavic languages; the others being Belarusian and Ukrainian (and possibly Rusyn). Written examples of Old East Slavic (\"Old Russian\") are attested from the 10th century onwards.\n\nOver a quarter of the world's scientific literature is published in Russian. Russian is also applied as a means of coding and storage of universal knowledge—60–70% of all world information is published in the English and Russian languages. The language is one of the six official languages of the United Nations.\n\nNew Russian folklore takes its roots in the pagan beliefs of ancient Slavs, which is nowadays still represented in the Russian folklore. Epic Russian bylinas are also an important part of Slavic mythology. The oldest bylinas of Kievan cycle were actually recorded mostly in the Russian North, especially in Karelia, where most of the Finnish national epic Kalevala was recorded as well. \nMany Russian fairy tales and bylinas were adapted for Russian animations, or for feature movies by famous directors like Aleksandr Ptushko (\"Ilya Muromets\", \"Sadko\") and Aleksandr Rou (\"Morozko\", \"Vasilisa the Beautiful\"). Some Russian poets, including Pyotr Yershov and Leonid Filatov, created a number of well-known poetical interpretations of classical Russian fairy tales, and in some cases, like that of Alexander Pushkin, also created fully original fairy tale poems that became very popular.\n\nFolklorists today consider the 1920s the Soviet Union's golden age of folklore. The struggling new government, which had to focus its efforts on establishing a new administrative system and building up the nation's backwards economy, could not be bothered with attempting to control literature, so studies of folklore thrived. There were two primary trends of folklore study during the decade: the formalist and Finnish schools. Formalism focused on the artistic form of ancient byliny and faerie tales, specifically their use of distinctive structures and poetic devices. The Finnish school was concerned with connections amongst related legends of various Eastern European regions. Finnish scholars collected comparable tales from multiple locales and analyzed their similarities and differences, hoping to trace these epic stories’ migration paths.\n\nOnce Joseph Stalin came to power and put his first five-year plan into motion in 1928, the Soviet government began to criticize and censor folklore studies. Stalin and the Soviet regime repressed folklore, believing that it supported the old tsarist system and a capitalist economy. They saw it as a reminder of the backward Russian society that the Bolsheviks were working to surpass. To keep folklore studies in check and prevent \"inappropriate\" ideas from spreading amongst the masses, the government created the RAPP – the Russian Association of Proletarian Writers. The RAPP specifically focused on censoring fairy tales and children's literature, believing that fantasies and \"bourgeois nonsense\" harmed the development of upstanding Soviet citizens. Fairy tales were removed from bookshelves and children were encouraged to read books focusing on nature and science. RAPP eventually increased its levels of censorship and became the Union of Soviet Writers in 1932.\nIn order to continue researching and analyzing folklore, intellectuals needed to justify its worth to the Communist regime. Otherwise, collections of folklore, along with all other literature deemed useless for the purposes of Stalin's Five Year Plan, would be an unacceptable realm of study. In 1934, Maksim Gorky gave a speech to the Union of Soviet Writers arguing that folklore could, in fact, be consciously used to promote Communist values. Apart from expounding on the artistic value of folklore, he stressed that traditional legends and fairy tales showed ideal, community-oriented characters, which exemplified the model Soviet citizen. Folklore, with many of its conflicts based on the struggles of a labor-oriented lifestyle, was relevant to Communism as it could not have existed without the direct contribution of the working classes. Also, Gorky explained that folklore characters expressed high levels of optimism, and therefore could encourage readers to maintain a positive mindset, especially as their lives changed with the further development of Communism.\n\nYuri Sokolov, the head of the folklore section of the Union of Soviet Writers also promoted the study of folklore by arguing that folklore had originally been the oral tradition of the working people, and consequently could be used to motivate and inspire collective projects amongst the present-day proletariat. Characters throughout traditional Russian folktales often found themselves on a journey of self-discovery, a process that led them to value themselves not as individuals, but rather as a necessary part of a common whole. The attitudes of such legendary characters paralleled the mindset that the Soviet government wished to instill in its citizens. He also pointed out the existence of many tales that showed members of the working class outsmarting their cruel masters, again working to prove folklore's value to Soviet ideology and the nation's society at large.\nConvinced by Gorky and Sokolov's arguments, the Soviet government and the Union of Soviet Writers began collecting and evaluating folklore from across the country. The Union handpicked and recorded particular stories that, in their eyes, sufficiently promoted the collectivist spirit and showed the Soviet regime's benefits and progress. It then proceeded to redistribute copies of approved stories throughout the population. Meanwhile, local folklore centers arose in all major cities. Responsible for advocating a sense of Soviet nationalism, these organizations ensured that the media published appropriate versions of Russian folktales in a systematic fashion.\nApart from circulating government-approved fairy tales and byliny that already existed, during Stalin's rule authors parroting appropriate Soviet ideologies wrote Communist folktales and introduced them to the population. These contemporary folktales combined the structures and motifs of the old byliny with contemporary life in the Soviet Union. Called noviny, these new tales were considered the renaissance of the Russian epic. Folklorists were called upon to teach modern folksingers the conventional style and structure of the traditional byliny. They also explained to the performers the appropriate types of Communist ideology that should be represented in the new stories and songs As the performers of the day were often poorly educated, they needed to obtain a thorough understanding of Marxist ideology before they could be expected to impart folktales to the public in a manner that suited the Soviet government. Besides undergoing extensive education, many folk performers traveled throughout the nation in order to gain insight into the lives of the working class, and thus communicate their stories more effectively. Due to their crucial role in spreading Communist ideals throughout the Soviet Union, eventually some of these performers became highly valued members of Soviet society. A number of them, despite their illiteracy, were even elected as members of the Union of Soviet Writers.\n\nThese new Soviet fairy tales and folk songs primarily focused on the contrasts between a miserable life in old tsarist Russia and an improved one under Stalin's leadership. Their characters represented identities for which Soviet citizens should strive, exemplifying the traits of the \"New Soviet Man.\" The heroes of Soviet tales were meant to portray a transformed and improved version of the average citizen, giving the reader a clear goal for an ideal community-oriented self that the future he or she was meant to become. These new folktales replaced magic with technology, and supernatural forces with Stalin. Instead of receiving essential advice from a mythical being, the protagonist would be given advice from omniscient Stalin. If the character followed Stalin's divine advice, he could be assured success in all his endeavors and a complete transformation into the \"New Soviet Man.\" The villains of these contemporary fairy tales were the Whites and their leader Idolisce, \"the most monstrous idol,\" who was the equivalent of the tsar. Descriptions of the Whites in noviny mirrored those of the Tartars in byliny. In these new stories, the Whites were incompetent, stagnant capitalists, while the Soviet citizens became invincible heroes.\n\nOnce Stalin died in March 1953, folklorists of the period quickly abandoned the new folktales. Written by individual authors and performers, noviny did not come from the oral traditions of the working class. Consequently, today they are considered pseudo-folklore, rather than genuine Soviet (or Russian) folklore. Without any true connection to the masses, there was no reason noviny should be considered anything other than contemporary literature. Specialists decided that attempts to represent contemporary life through the structure and artistry of the ancient epics could not be considered genuine folklore. Stalin's name has been omitted from the few surviving pseudo-folktales of the period. Instead of considering folklore under Stalin a renaissance of the traditional Russian epic, today it is generally regarded as a period of restraint and falsehood.\n\nRussian literature is considered to be among the most influential and developed in the world, with some of the most famous literary works belonging to it. Russia's literary history dates back to the 10th century; in the 18th century its development was boosted by the works of Mikhail Lomonosov and Denis Fonvizin, and by the early 19th century a modern native tradition had emerged, producing some of the greatest writers of all time. This period and the Golden Age of Russian Poetry began with Alexander Pushkin, considered to be the founder of modern Russian literature and often described as the \"\"Russian Shakespeare\" or the \"Russian Goethe\"\". It continued in the 19th century with the poetry of Mikhail Lermontov and Nikolay Nekrasov, dramas of Aleksandr Ostrovsky and Anton Chekhov, and the prose of Nikolai Gogol, Ivan Turgenev, Leo Tolstoy, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin, Ivan Goncharov, Aleksey Pisemsky and Nikolai Leskov. Tolstoy and Dostoevsky in particular were titanic figures, to the point that many literary critics have described one or the other as the greatest novelist ever.\n\nBy the 1880s Russian literature had begun to change. The age of the great novelists was over and short fiction and poetry became the dominant genres of Russian literature for the next several decades, which later became known as the Silver Age of Russian Poetry. Previously dominated by realism, Russian literature came under strong influence of symbolism in the years between 1893 and 1914. Leading writers of this age include Valery Bryusov, Andrei Bely, Vyacheslav Ivanov, Aleksandr Blok, Nikolay Gumilev, Dmitry Merezhkovsky, Fyodor Sologub, Anna Akhmatova, Osip Mandelstam, Marina Tsvetaeva, Leonid Andreyev, Ivan Bunin, and Maxim Gorky.\n\nFollowing the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the ensuing civil war, Russian cultural life was left in chaos. Some prominent writers, like Ivan Bunin and Vladimir Nabokov left the country, while a new generation of talented writers joined together in different organizations with the aim of creating a new and distinctive working-class culture appropriate for the new state, the Soviet Union. Throughout the 1920s writers enjoyed broad tolerance. In the 1930s censorship over literature was tightened in line with Joseph Stalin's policy of socialist realism. After his death the restrictions on literature were eased, and by the 1970s and 1980s, writers were increasingly ignoring official guidelines. The leading authors of the Soviet era included Yevgeny Zamiatin, Isaac Babel, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Ilf and Petrov, Yury Olesha, Mikhail Bulgakov, Boris Pasternak, Mikhail Sholokhov, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Yevgeny Yevtushenko, and Andrey Voznesensky.\n\nThe Soviet era was also the golden age of Russian science fiction, that was initially inspired by western authors and enthusiastically developed with the success of Soviet space program. Authors like Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, Kir Bulychev, Ivan Yefremov, Alexander Belyaev enjoyed mainstream popularity at the time. An important theme of Russian literature has always been the Russian soul.\n\nSome Russian writers, like Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky, are known also as philosophers, while many more authors are known primarily for their philosophical works. Russian philosophy blossomed since the 19th century, when it was defined initially by the opposition of Westernizers, advocating Russia's following the Western political and economical models, and Slavophiles, insisting on developing Russia as a unique civilization. The latter group includes Nikolai Danilevsky and Konstantin Leontiev, the early founders of eurasianism.\n\nIn its further developments, Russian philosophy was always marked by a deep connection to literature and interest in creativity, society, politics and nationalism; cosmos and religion were other primary subjects. Notable philosophers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries include Vladimir Solovyov, Sergei Bulgakov, Pavel Florensky, Nikolai Berdyaev, Vladimir Lossky and Vladimir Vernadsky. In the 20th century Russian philosophy became dominated by Marxism.\n\nRussia owes much of its wit to the great flexibility and richness of the Russian language, allowing for puns and unexpected associations. As with any other nation, its vast scope ranges from lewd jokes and silly word play to political satire.\n\nRussian jokes, the most popular form of Russian humour, are short fictional stories or dialogues with a punch line. Russian joke culture features a series of categories with fixed and highly familiar settings and characters. Surprising effects are achieved by an endless variety of plots. Russians love jokes on topics found everywhere in the world, be it politics, spouse relations, or mothers-in-law.\n\nChastushka, a type of traditional Russian poetry, is a single quatrain in trochaic tetrameter with an \"abab\" or \"abcb\" rhyme scheme. Usually humorous, satirical, or ironic in nature, chastushkas are often put to music as well, usually with balalaika or accordion accompaniment. The rigid, short structure (and to a lesser degree, the type of humor these use) parallels limericks. The name originates from the Russian word \"части́ть\", meaning \"to speak fast.\"\n\nRussian visual artworks are similar in style with the ones from other eastern Slavic countries, like Ukraine or Belarus.\n\nAs early as the 12th and 13th centuries Russia had its national masters who were free of all foreign influence, i. e. that of the Greeks on the one hand, and on the other hand that of the Lombard master-masons called in Andrei Georgievich to build the Uspensky (Assumption) Cathedral in the city of Vladimir. Russia's relations with the Greek world were hampered by the Mongol invasion, and it is to the isolation arising from this that we must attribute the originality of Slavo-Russian ornamentation, which has a character of its own, quite unlike the Byzantine style and its derivative, the Romanesque.\n\nRussian architecture began with the woodcraft buildings of ancient Slavs. Some characteristics taken from the Slavic pagan temples are the exterior galleries and the plurality of towers. Since the Christianization of Kievan Rus', for several centuries Russian architecture was influenced predominantly by the Byzantine architecture, until the Fall of Constantinople. Apart from fortifications (kremlins), the main stone buildings of ancient Rus' were Orthodox churches, with their many domes, often gilded or brightly painted. Aristotle Fioravanti and other Italian architects brought Renaissance trends into Russia. The 16th century saw the development of unique tent-like churches culminating in Saint Basil's Cathedral. By that time the onion dome design was also fully developed. In the 17th century, the \"fiery style\" of ornamentation flourished in Moscow and Yaroslavl, gradually paving the way for the Naryshkin baroque of the 1690s. After Peter the Great reforms had made Russia much closer to Western culture, the change of the architectural styles in the country generally followed that of Western Europe.\n\nThe 18th-century taste for rococo architecture led to the splendid works of Bartolomeo Rastrelli and his followers. During the reign of Catherine the Great and her grandson Alexander I, the city of Saint Petersburg was transformed into an outdoor museum of Neoclassical architecture. The second half of the 19th century was dominated by the Byzantine and Russian Revival style (this corresponds to Gothic Revival in Western Europe). Prevalent styles of the 20th century were the Art Nouveau (Fyodor Shekhtel), Constructivism (Moisei Ginzburg and Victor Vesnin), and the Stalin Empire style (Boris Iofan). After Stalin's death a new Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, condemned the \"excesses\" of the former architectural styles, and in the late Soviet era the architecture of the country was dominated by plain functionalism. This helped somewhat to resolve the housing problem, but created the large massives of buildings of low architectural quality, much in contrast with the previous bright architecture. After the end of the Soviet Union the situation improved. Many churches demolished in the Soviet times were rebuilt, and this process continues along with the restoration of various historical buildings destroyed in World War II. As for the original architecture, there is no more any common style in modern Russia, though International style has a great influence.\n\nSome notable Russian buildings include:\n\nMatryoshka doll is a Russian nesting doll. A set of Matryoshka dolls consist of a wooden figure which can be pulled apart to reveal another figure of the same sort but somewhat smaller inside. It has in turn another somewhat smaller figure inside, and so on. The number of nested figures is usually six or more. The shape is mostly cylindrical, rounded at the top for the head and tapered towards the bottom, but little else. The dolls have no extremities, (except those that are painted). The true artistry is in the painting of each doll, which can be extremely elaborate. The theme is usually peasant girls in traditional dress, but can be almost anything; for instance, fairy tales or Soviet leaders.\n\nOther forms of Russian handicraft include khokhloma, Dymkovo toy, gzhel, Zhostovo painting, Filimonov toys, pisanka, Pavlovo Posad shawl, Rushnyk, and palekh.\n\nRussian icons are typically paintings on wood, often small, though some in churches and monasteries may be as large as a table top. Many religious homes in Russia have icons hanging on the wall in the \"krasny ugol\", the \"red\" or \"beautiful\" corner (see Icon Corner). There is a rich history and elaborate religious symbolism associated with icons. In Russian churches, the nave is typically separated from the sanctuary by an \"iconostasis\" (Russian \"ikonostás\") a wall of icons. Icon paintings in Russia attempted to help people with their prayers without idolizing the figure in the painting. The most comprehensive collection of Icon art is found at the Tretyakov Gallery.\n\nThe use and making of icons entered Kievan Rus' following its conversion to Orthodox Christianity from the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire in 988 AD. As a general rule, these icons strictly followed models and formulas hallowed by usage, some of which had originated in Constantinople. As time passed, the Russians—notably Andrei Rublev and Dionisius—widened the vocabulary of iconic types and styles far beyond anything found elsewhere. The personal, improvisatory and creative traditions of Western European religious art are largely lacking in Russia before the seventeenth century, when Simon Ushakov's painting became strongly influenced by religious paintings and engravings from Protestant as well as Catholic Europe.\n\nIn the mid-seventeenth century, changes in liturgy and practice instituted by Patriarch Nikon resulted in a split in the Russian Orthodox Church. The traditionalists, the persecuted \"Old Ritualists\" or \"Old Believers\", continued the traditional stylization of icons, while the State Church modified its practice. From that time icons began to be painted not only in the traditional stylized and nonrealistic mode, but also in a mixture of Russian stylization and Western European realism, and in a Western European manner very much like that of Catholic religious art of the time. The Stroganov movement and the icons from Nevyansk rank among the last important schools of Russian icon-painting.\n\nA lubok (plural \"Lubki\", Cyrillic: ) is a Russian popular print, characterized by simple graphics and narratives derived from literature, religious stories and popular tales. Lubki prints were used as decoration in houses and inns. Early examples from the late 17th and early 18th centuries were woodcuts, then engravings or etchings were typical, and from the mid-19th century lithography. They sometimes appeared in series, which might be regarded as predecessors of the modern comic strip. Cheap and simple books, similar to chapbooks, which mostly consisted of pictures, are called lubok literature or (Cyrillic: ). Both pictures and literature are commonly referred to simply as \"lubki\". The Russian word \"lubok\" derives from \"lub\" – a special type of board that pictures were printed on.\n\nThe Russian Academy of Arts was created in 1757 with the aim of giving Russian artists an international role and status. Notable portrait painters from the Academy include Ivan Argunov, Fyodor Rokotov, Dmitry Levitzky, and Vladimir Borovikovsky.\n\nIn the early 19th century, when neoclassicism and romantism flourished, famous academic artists focused on mythological and Biblical themes, like Karl Briullov and Alexander Ivanov.\n\nRealism came into dominance in the 19th century. The realists captured Russian identity in landscapes of wide rivers, forests, and birch clearings, as well as vigorous genre scenes and robust portraits of their contemporaries. Other artists focused on social criticism, showing the conditions of the poor and caricaturing authority; critical realism flourished under the reign of Alexander II, with some artists making the circle of human suffering their main theme. Others focused on depicting dramatic moments in Russian history. The \"Peredvizhniki\" (\"wanderers\") group of artists broke with Russian Academy and initiated a school of art liberated from Academic restrictions. Leading realists include Ivan Shishkin, Arkhip Kuindzhi, Ivan Kramskoi, Vasily Polenov, Isaac Levitan, Vasily Surikov, Viktor Vasnetsov and Ilya Repin.\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century and on, many Russian artists developed their own unique styles, neither realist nor avante-garde. These include Boris Kustodiev, Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin, Mikhail Vrubel and Nicholas Roerich. Many works by the Peredvizhniki group of artists have been highly sought after by collectors in recent years. Russian art auctions during Russian Art Week in London have increased in demand and works have been sold for record breaking prices.\n\nThe Russian avant-garde is an umbrella term used to define the large, influential wave of modernist art that flourished in Russia from approximately 1890 to 1930. The term covers many separate, but inextricably related, art movements that occurred at the time; namely neo-primitivism, suprematism, constructivism, rayonism, and futurism. Notable artists from this era include El Lissitzky, Kazimir Malevich, Wassily Kandinsky, Vladimir Tatlin, Alexander Rodchenko, Pavel Filonov and Marc Chagall. The Russian avant-garde reached its creative and popular height in the period between the Russian Revolution of 1917 and 1932, at which point the revolutionary ideas of the avant-garde clashed with the newly emerged conservative direction of socialist realism.\n\nIn the 20th century many Russian artists made their careers in Western Europe, forced to emigrate by the Revolution. Wassily Kandinsky, Marc Chagall, Naum Gabo and others spread their work, ideas, and the impact of Russian art globally.\n\nDuring the Russian Revolution a movement was initiated to put all arts to service of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The instrument for this was created just days before the October Revolution, known as Proletkult, an abbreviation for \"Proletarskie kulturno-prosvetitelnye organizatsii\" (Proletarian Cultural and Enlightenment Organizations). A prominent theorist of this movement was Alexander Bogdanov. Initially, Narkompros (ministry of education), which was also in charge of the arts, supported Proletkult. Although Marxist in character, the Proletkult gained the disfavor of many party leaders, and by 1922 it had declined considerably. It was eventually disbanded by Stalin in 1932. \"De facto\" restrictions on what artists could paint were abandoned by the late 1980s.\n\nHowever, in the late Soviet era many artists combined innovation with socialist realism including Ernst Neizvestny, Ilya Kabakov, Mikhail Shemyakin, Igor Novikov, Erik Bulatov, and Vera Mukhina. They employed techniques as varied as primitivism, hyperrealism, grotesque, and abstraction. Soviet artists produced works that were furiously patriotic and anti-fascist in the 1940s. After the Great Patriotic War Soviet sculptors made multiple monuments to the war dead, marked by a great restrained solemnity.\n\nRussians have distinctive traditions of folk music. Typical ethnic Russian musical instruments are gusli, balalaika, zhaleika, balalaika contrabass, bayan accordion, Gypsy guitar and garmoshka. Folk music had great influence on the Russian classical composers, and in modern times it is a source of inspiration for a number of popular folk bands, most prominent being Golden Ring, Ural's Nation Choir, Lyudmila Zykina. Russian folk songs, as well as patriotic songs of the Soviet era, constitute the bulk of repertoire of the world-renowned Red Army choir and other popular Russian ensembles.\n\nRussian folk dance (Russian: Русский Народный Танец ) can generally be broken up into two main types of dances Khorovod (Russian: Хоровод), a circular game type dance where the participants hold hands, sing, and the action generally happens in the middle of circle, and Plyaska (Russian: Пляска or Плясовый), a circular dance for men and women that increases in diversity and tempo, according to Bob Renfield, considered to be the preeminent scholar on the topic. Other forms of Russian Folk Dance include Pereplyas (Russian: Перепляс), an all-male competitive dance, Mass Dance (Russian: Массовый пляс), an unpaired stage dance without restrictions on age or number of participants, Group Dance (Russian: Групповая пляска) a type of mass dance employs simple round-dance passages, and improvisation, and types of Quadrilles (Russian: Кадриль), originally a French dance brought to Russia in the 18th century.\n\nEthnic Russian dances include khorovod (Russian: Хоровод), barynya (Russian: Барыня), kamarinskaya (Russian: Камаринская), kazachok (Russian: Казачок) and chechotka (Russian: Чечётка) (a tap dance in bast shoes and with a bayan). Troika (Russian: Тройка) A dance with one man and two women, named after the traditional Russian carriage which is led by three horses. Bear Dance or dancing with bears (Russian: Танец С Медведем) Dates back to 907 when Great Russian Prince Oleg, in celebration of his victory over the Greeks in Kiev, had as entertainment, 16 male dancers dress as bears and four bears dress as dancers . Dances with dancers dressed as bears are a recurring theme, as seen a recording of the Omsk Russian Folk Chorus. One of the main characteristics of Russian furious dances is the Russian squat dance elements.\n\nMusic in 19th-century Russia was defined by the tension between classical composer Mikhail Glinka along with the other members of The Mighty Handful, who embraced Russian national identity and added religious and folk elements to their compositions, and the Russian Musical Society led by composers Anton and Nikolay Rubinstein, which was musically conservative. The later Romantic tradition of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, one of the greatest composers of the Romantic era, whose music has come to be known and loved for its distinctly Russian character as well as its rich harmonies and stirring melodies, was brought into the 20th century by Sergei Rachmaninoff, one of the last great champions of the Romantic style of European classical music.\n\nWorld-renowned composers of the 20th century included Alexander Scriabin, Igor Stravinsky, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Sergei Prokofiev, Dmitri Shostakovich and Georgy Sviridov. During most of the Soviet Era, music was highly scrutinized and kept within a conservative, accessible idiom in conformity with the policy of socialist realism.\n\nSoviet and Russian conservatories have turned out generations of world-renowned soloists. Among the best known are violinists David Oistrakh and Gidon Kremer; cellist Mstislav Rostropovich; pianists Vladimir Horowitz, Sviatoslav Richter, and Emil Gilels; and vocalists Fyodor Shalyapin, Galina Vishnevskaya, Anna Netrebko and Dmitry Hvorostovsky.\n\nThe original purpose of the ballet in Russia was to entertain the imperial court. The first ballet company was the Imperial School of Ballet in St. Petersburg in the 1740s. The Ballets Russes was a ballet company founded in the 1909 by Sergey Diaghilev, an enormously important figure in the Russian ballet scene. Diaghilev and his Ballets Russes' travels abroad profoundly influenced the development of dance worldwide. The headquarters of his ballet company was located in Paris, France. A protégé of Diaghilev, George Balanchine, founded the New York City Ballet Company in 1948.\n\nDuring the early 20th century, Russian ballet dancers Anna Pavlova and Vaslav Nijinsky rose to fame. Soviet ballet preserved the perfected 19th century traditions, and the Soviet Union's choreography schools produced one internationally famous star after another, including Maya Plisetskaya, Rudolf Nureyev, and Mikhail Baryshnikov. The Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow and the Mariinsky in Saint Petersburg remain famous throughout the world.\n\nThe first known opera made in Russia was \"A Life for the Tsar\" by Mikhail Glinka in 1836. This was followed by several operas such as \"Ruslan and Lyudmila\" in 1842. Russian opera was originally a combination of Russian folk music and Italian opera. After the October revolution many opera composers left Russia. Russia's most popular operas include \"Boris Godunov\", \"Eugene Onegin\", \"The Golden Cockerel\", \"Prince Igor\", and \"The Queen of Spades\".\n\nSince the late Soviet times Russia has experienced another wave of Western cultural influence, which led to the development of many previously unknown phenomena in the Russian culture. The most vivid example, perhaps, is the Russian rock music, which takes its roots both in the Western rock and roll and heavy metal, and in traditions of the Russian bards of Soviet era, like Vladimir Vysotsky and Bulat Okudzhava. Saint-Petersburg (former Leningrad), Yekaterinburg (former Sverdlovsk) and Omsk became the main centers of development of the rock music. Popular Russian rock groups include Mashina Vremeni, Slot, DDT, Aquarium, Alisa, Kino, Nautilus Pompilius, Aria, Grazhdanskaya Oborona, Splean and Korol i Shut. At the same time Russian pop music developed from what was known in the Soviet times as \"estrada\" into full-fledged industry, with some performers gaining international recognition, like t.A.T.u. in the West, who have been said to be the most influential artists to ever come out of Russia, or Vitas in China. Another kind of music, Hardbass, has become an internet meme.\n\nWhile in the industrialized nations of the West, motion pictures had first been accepted as a form of cheap recreation and leisure for the working class, Russian filmmaking came to prominence following the 1917 revolution when it explored editing as the primary mode of cinematic expression. Russian and later Soviet cinema was a hotbed of invention in the period immediately following the 1917 revolution, resulting in world-renowned films such as \"Battleship Potemkin\". Soviet-era filmmakers, most notably Sergei Eisenstein and Andrei Tarkovsky, would become some of the world's most innovative and influential directors.\nEisenstein was a student of filmmaker and theorist Lev Kuleshov, who developed the groundbreaking Soviet montage theory of film editing at the world's first film school, the All-Union Institute of Cinematography. Dziga Vertov, whose \"kino-glaz\" (\"film-eye\") theory—that the camera, like the human eye, is best used to explore real life—had a huge impact on the development of documentary film making and cinema realism. In 1932, Stalin made socialist realism the state policy; this somewhat limited creativity, however many Soviet films in this style were artistically successful, like \"Chapaev\", \"The Cranes Are Flying\", and \"Ballad of a Soldier\".\n\n1960s and 1970s saw a greater variety of artistic styles in the Soviet cinema. Eldar Ryazanov's and Leonid Gaidai's comedies of that time were immensely popular, with many of the catch phrases still in use today. In 1961–1967 Sergey Bondarchuk directed an Oscar-winning film adaptation of Tolstoy's epic \"War and Peace\", which was the most expensive Soviet film made. In 1969, Vladimir Motyl's \"White Sun of the Desert\" was released, a very popular film in a genre known as 'osterns'; the film is traditionally watched by cosmonauts before any trip into space.\n\nThe late 1980s and 1990s were a period of crisis in Russian cinema and animation. Although Russian filmmakers became free to express themselves, state subsidies were drastically reduced, resulting in fewer films produced. The early years of the 21st century have brought increased viewership and subsequent prosperity to the industry on the back of the economy's rapid development, and production levels are already higher than in Britain and Germany. Russia's total box-office revenue in 2007 was $565 million, up 37% from the previous year (by comparison, in 1996 revenues stood at $6 million). Russian cinema continues to receive international recognition. \"Russian Ark\" (2002) was the first feature film ever to be shot in a single take.\n\nRussia also has a long and rich tradition of animation, which started already in the late Russian Empire times. Most of Russia's cartoon production for cinema and television was created during Soviet times, when Soyuzmultfilm studio was the largest animation producer. Soviet animators developed a great and unmatched variety of pioneering techniques and aesthetic styles, with prominent directors including Ivan Ivanov-Vano, Fyodor Khitruk and Aleksandr Tatarskiy. Soviet cartoons are still a source for many popular catch phrases, while such cartoon heroes as Russian-style Winnie-the-Pooh, cute little Cheburashka, Wolf and Hare from \"Nu, Pogodi!\" being iconic images in Russia and many surrounding countries. The traditions of Soviet animation were developed in the past decade by such directors as Aleksandr Petrov and studios like Melnitsa, along with Ivan Maximov.\n\nRussia was among the first countries to introduce radio and television. Due to the enormous size of the country Russia leads in the number of TV broadcast stations and repeaters. There were few channels in the Soviet time, but in the past two decades many new state-run and private-owned radio stations and TV channels appeared. In 2005 a state-run English language Russia Today TV started broadcasting, and its Arabic version Rusiya Al-Yaum was launched in 2007.\n\nOriginating from Russian and telecommunication industries, a specific Russian culture of using the Internet has been established since the early 1990s. In the second half of the 1990s, the term \"Runet\" was coined to call the segment of Internet written or understood in the Russian language. Whereas the Internet \"has no boundaries\", \"Russian Internet\" (online communications in the Russian language) can not be localized solely to the users residing in the Russian Federation as it includes Russian-speaking people from all around the world. This segment includes millions of users in other ex-USSR countries, Israel and others abroad diasporas.\n\nWith the introduction of the Web, many social and cultural events found reflections within the Russian Internet society. Various online communities formed, and the most popular one grew out of the Russian-speaking users of the California-based blogging platform LiveJournal (which was completely bought out in December 2007 by Russian firm SUP Fabrik). In January 2008 a LiveJournal blog of the \"3rd statesman\" Sergey Mironov had appeared and he was shortly followed by the new President Dmitry Medvedev who opened a personal video blog which was later also expanded with a LiveJournal version.\n\nAs of late, there are scores of websites offering Russian language content including mass media, e-commerce, search engines and so on. Particularly notorious are the \"Russian Hackers\". Russian web design studios, software and web-hosting enterprises offer a variety of services, and the results form a sort of national digital culture. E-commerce giants such as Google and Microsoft have their Russian branches. In September 2007, the national domain .ru passed the milestone of a million domain names. By the end of the 2000s, VKontakte social network became the most populated in the Runet.\n\nAt the start of the 18th century the reforms of Peter the Great (the founder of Russian Academy of Sciences and Saint Petersburg State University) and the work of such champions as polymath Mikhail Lomonosov (the founder of Moscow State University) gave a great boost for development of science, engineering and innovation in Russia. In the 19th and 20th centuries Russia produced a large number of great and inventors.\n\nNikolai Lobachevsky, a \"Copernicus of Geometry\", developed the non-Euclidean geometry. Dmitry Mendeleev invented the Periodic table, the main framework of the modern chemistry. Nikolay Benardos introduced the arc welding, further developed by Nikolay Slavyanov, Konstantin Khrenov and other Russian engineers. Gleb Kotelnikov invented the knapsack parachute, while Evgeniy Chertovsky introduced the pressure suit. Pavel Yablochkov and Alexander Lodygin were great pioneers of electrical engineering and inventors of early electric lamps.\n\nAlexander Popov was among the inventors of radio, while Nikolai Basov and Alexander Prokhorov were co-inventors of lasers and masers. Igor Tamm, Andrei Sakharov and Lev Artsimovich developed the idea of tokamak for controlled nuclear fusion and created its first prototype, which finally led to the modern ITER project. Many famous Russian scientists and inventors were émigrés, like Igor Sikorsky and Vladimir Zworykin, and many foreign ones worked in Russia for a long time, like Leonard Euler and Alfred Nobel.\nThe greatest Russian successes are in the field of space technology and space exploration. Konstantin Tsiolkovsky was the father of theoretical astronautics. His works had inspired leading Soviet rocket engineers such as Sergei Korolev, Valentin Glushko, and many others that contributed to the success of the Soviet space program at early stages of the Space Race and beyond.\n\nIn 1957 the first Earth-orbiting artificial satellite, \"Sputnik 1\", was launched; in 1961 on 12 April the first human trip into space was successfully made by Yury Gagarin; and many other Soviet and Russian space exploration records ensued, including the first spacewalk performed by Alexei Leonov, the first space exploration rover \"Lunokhod-1\" and the first space station \"Salyut 1\". Nowadays Russia is the largest satellite launcher and the only provider of transport for space tourism services.\nOther technologies, where Russia historically leads, include nuclear technology, aircraft production and arms industry. The creation of the first nuclear power plant along with the first nuclear reactors for submarines and surface ships was directed by Igor Kurchatov. NS \"Lenin\" was the world's first nuclear-powered surface ship as well as the first nuclear-powered civilian vessel, and NS \"Arktika\" became the first surface ship to reach the North Pole.\n\nA number of prominent Soviet aerospace engineers, inspired by the theoretical works of Nikolai Zhukovsky, supervised the creation of many dozens of models of military and civilian aircraft and founded a number of \"KBs\" (\"Construction Bureaus\") that now constitute the bulk of Russian United Aircraft Corporation. Famous Russian airplanes include the first supersonic passenger jet Tupolev Tu-144 by Alexei Tupolev, MiG fighter aircraft series by Artem Mikoyan and Mikhail Gurevich, and Su series by Pavel Sukhoi and his followers. MiG-15 is the world's most produced jet aircraft in history, while MiG-21 is most produced supersonic aircraft. During World War II era Bereznyak-Isayev BI-1 was introduced as the first rocket-powered fighter aircraft, and Ilyushin Il-2 bomber became the most produced military aircraft in history. Polikarpov Po-2 \"Kukuruznik\" is the world's most produced biplane, and Mil Mi-8 is the most produced helicopter.\n\nFamous Russian battle tanks include T-34, the best tank design of World War II, and further tanks of T-series, including T-54/55, the most produced tank in history, first fully gas turbine tank T-80 and the most modern Russian tank T-90. The AK-47 and AK-74 by Mikhail Kalashnikov constitute the most widely used type of assault rifle throughout the world – so much so that more AK-type rifles have been produced than all other assault rifles combined. With these and other weapons Russia for a long time has been among the world's top suppliers of arms.\n\nNot only the minorities in Russia but the Russian culture as a whole has in the different regions of the country like in Northwest Russia, Central Russia, Southern Russia, Siberian Russia, Volga Russia, Ural Russia, Far East Russia and the Russian North Caucasus and their Oblasts own local traditions and characteristics which were developed over a long period of time through strong ethno-cultural interactions within the various groups and communities, like Slavs, Tatars and Finno-Ugrics.\n\nTraditional Russian clothes include kaftan, a cloth which Old Russia had in common with similar robes in the Ottoman Empire, Scandinavia and Persia. Kosovorotka, which was over a long time of period a traditional holidays blouse worn by men. Ushanka for men, which design was influenced in 17th century when in central and northern Russia a hat with earflaps called treukh was worn. Sarafan which is connected to the Middle East region and were worn in Central- and Northern regions of Old Russia. In Southern Russia burka and papaha are connected to the Cossacks which, in turn, is culturally connected to the people of the Northern Caucaus. Kokoshnik for women was primarily worn in the northern regions of Russia in the 16th to 19th centuries. Lapti and similar shoes were mostly worn by poorer members in Old Russia and northern regions were Slavic, Baltic and Finno-Ugric people lived. Valenki are traditional Russian shoes from 18th century designs which originally originated in the Great steppe, from Asian nomads. Russian traditional cloths and its elements still have a high priority in today's Russia, especially in pagan Slavic communities, folk festivals, Cossack communities, in modern fashion and Russian music ensembles.\n\nRussian cuisine widely uses fish, poultry, mushrooms, berries, and honey. Crops of rye, wheat, barley, and millet provide the ingredients for a plethora of breads, pancakes, cereals, kvass, beer, and vodka. Black bread is relatively more popular in Russia compared to the rest of the world. Soups, stews and filled dumplings are very characteristic for Russian cuisine. The most popular soups include shchi, borsch, ukha, solyanka and okroshka. Smetana (a heavy sour cream) is often added to soups and salads. Most popular dumplings are pirozhki, pelmeni, varenyky and Turkic manti. One of the most popular are foods are blini, which are like syrniki native types of Russian pancakes. Furthermore, Cutlets (like Chicken Kiev) and shashlyk are popular meat dishes, the last one being of Tatar and Caucasus. origin respectively. Popular salads include Russian Salad, vinaigrette and Dressed Herring. One of the main characteristics of Russian food culture are Zakuski, which define a Russian-laid table.\n\nThere are eight public holidays in Russia. The New Year is the first in calendar and in popularity. Russian New Year traditions resemble those of the Western Christmas, with New Year Trees and gifts, and Ded Moroz (Father Frost) playing the same role as Santa Claus. Rozhdestvo (Orthodox Christmas) falls on 7 January, because Russian Orthodox Church still follows the Julian (old style) calendar and all Orthodox holidays are 13 days after Catholic ones. Another two major Christian holidays are Paskha (Easter) and Troitsa (Trinity), but there is no need to recognize them as public holidays since they are always celebrated on Sunday.\n\nFurther Russian public holidays include Defender of the Fatherland Day (23 February), which honors Russian men, especially those serving in the army; International Women's Day (8 March), which combines the traditions of Mother's Day and Valentine's Day; International Workers' Day (1 May), now renamed \"Spring and Labor Day\"; Victory Day (9 May); Russia Day (12 June); and Unity Day (4 November), commemorating the popular uprising which expelled the Polish-Lithuanian occupation force from Moscow in 1612. The latter is a replacement for the old Soviet holiday celebrating October Revolution of 1917 (again, it was falling on November because of the difference of calendars). Fireworks and outdoor concerts are common features of all Russian public holidays.\nVictory Day is the second popular holiday in Russia, it commemorates the victory over Nazi Germany in World War II and is widely celebrated throughout Russia. A huge military parade, hosted by the President of the Russian Federation, is annually organized in Moscow on Red Square. Similar parades are organized in all major Russian cities and the cities with the status \"Hero city\" or \"City of Military Glory\".\n\nOther popular holidays, which are not public, include Old New Year (New Year according to Julian Calendar on 1 January), Tatiana Day (day of Russian students on 25 January), Maslenitsa (an old pagan holiday a week before the Great Lent), Cosmonautics Day (a day of Yury Gagarin's first ever human trip into space on 12 April), Ivan Kupala Day (another pagan Slavic holiday on 7 July) and Peter and Fevronia Day (taking place on 8 July and being the Russian analogue of Valentine's Day, which focuses, however, on the family love and fidelity). On different days in June there are major celebrations of the end of the school year, when graduates from schools and universities traditionally swim in the city fountains; the local varieties of these public events include Scarlet Sails tradition in Saint Petersburg.\n\nChristianity, Islam, Buddhism, and Judaism are Russia's traditional religions, deemed part of Russia's \"historical heritage\" in a law passed in 1997.\nEstimates of believers widely fluctuate among sources, and some reports put the number of non-believers in Russia as high as 16–48% of the population. Russian Orthodoxy is the dominant religion in Russia. 95% of the registered Orthodox parishes belong to the Russian Orthodox Church while there are a number of smaller Orthodox Churches. However, the vast majority of Orthodox believers do not attend church on a regular basis. Nonetheless, the church is widely respected by both believers and nonbelievers, who see it as a symbol of Russian heritage and culture. Smaller Christian denominations such as Roman Catholics, Armenian Gregorians, and various Protestants exist.\n\nThe ancestors of many of today's Russians adopted Orthodox Christianity in the 10th century. The 2007 International Religious Freedom Report published by the US Department of State said that approximately 100 million citizens consider themselves Russian Orthodox Christians. According to a poll by the Russian Public Opinion Research Center, 63% of respondents considered themselves Russian Orthodox, 6% of respondents considered themselves Muslim and less than 1% considered themselves either Buddhist, Catholic, Protestant or Jewish. Another 12% said they believe in God, but did not practice any religion, and 16% said they are non-believers.\n\nThe steppe culture of the Russian Cossacks originated from nomadic steppe people which merged with Eastern Slavic people groups into large communities. The early Cossack communities emerged in the 14th century, the first, among others, were the Don Cossacks. Other Cossack communities that have played an important role in Russia's history and culture are the Ural Cossacks, Terek Cossacks, Kuban Cossacks, Orenburg Cossacks, Volga Cossacks, Astrakhan Cossacks, Siberian Cossacks, Transbaikal Cossacks, Amur Cossacks, Ussuri Cossacks. Cossacks defended the Russian borders and expanded Russia's territory. The regions of the large Cossack communities enjoyed many freedoms in Tsarist Russia. The culture of the Cossacks became an important part of Russian culture, many Russian songs and various elements in dances and Russias culture in general were much shaped by the Cossack communities.\n\nThe forest plays a very important role in Russia's more than 1000-year-old culture and history. The forest had a great influence on the characteristics of Russian people and their cultural creations. Many myths of Russian culture are closely intertwined with the forest. Various of the early Slavic and other tribes built their houses out of wood so that the forest influenced the style of Russian architecture significantly. The handcraft Hohloma which originated in the Volga region is made out of wood and depicts numerous plants of the forest, like the berry Viburnum opulus (Russian: Калина, Kalina), flowers and leaves. Many Russian fairy tales play in the forest and fictional characters like Baba Yaga are strongly connected to Russian wood culture. The forest is also an important subject of many Russian folk songs.\n\nRussian walking culture\n\nStrolling or walking (Russian: гулять, \"gulyat\"') is very common in the Russian society. In contrast to many western countries strolling is very common among young people in Russia. Young people often arrange just to go for a walk. Besides the verb, the experience itself, which describes the time span of the walk, is called \"progulka\" (Russian: прогулка). Walking is so important in Russian culture that \"gulyat\"' is also a synonym for \"to party\".\n\nMushroom hunting and berry picking\n\nActivities in the forest where people pick mushrooms and berries are very common in Russia.\nMushrooms (Russian: грибы, \"griby)\" are an important part of Russian folk culture at least since the 10th century and became an essential part of Russian meals. There exist more than 200 kinds of edible mushrooms in Russia. Mushromms were always considered as magical and so they play a prominent role in Russian fairy tales. The ability to identify and prepare edible mushrooms is often passed on from generation to generation. The mushroom hunting tradition is especially common in Slavic-speaking and Baltic countries. The berry (Russian: Ягода, \"Yagoda\") also play an important role in Russian folk culture and is often part of Russian craftsmanship, folk songs and national costumes. The cranberry was known in Europe for centuries even as the \"Russian berry\". To pick mushrooms and berries in forests is a kind of meditation in Russia.\n\nRussians have been successful at a number of sports and consistently finish in the top rankings at the Olympic Games and in other international competitions. Combining the total medals of Soviet Union and Russia, the country is second among all nations by number of gold medals both at the Summer Olympics and at the Winter Olympics.\n\nDuring the Soviet era, the national Olympic team placed first in the total number of medals won at 14 of its 18 appearances; with these performances, the USSR was the dominant Olympic power of its era. Since the 1952 Olympic Games, Soviet and later Russian athletes have always been in the top three for the number of gold medals collected at the Summer Olympics.\n\nSoviet gymnasts, track-and-field athletes, weight lifters, wrestlers, boxers, fencers, shooters, chess players, cross country skiers, biathletes, speed skaters and figure skaters were consistently among the best in the world, along with Soviet basketball, handball, volleyball and ice hockey players. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russian athletes have continued to dominate international competitions. The 1980 Summer Olympic Games were held in Moscow while the 2014 Winter Olympics and the 2014 Winter Paralympics were hosted by Sochi.\nSoviet Union dominated the sport of gymnastics for many years, with such athletes as Larisa Latynina, who, until 2012, held a record of most Olympic medals won per person and most gold Olympic medals won by a woman. Today, Russia is leading in rhythmic gymnastics with such stars as Alina Kabaeva, Irina Tschaschina and Yevgeniya Kanayeva.\n\nRussian synchronized swimming is the best in the world, with almost all gold medals having been swept by Russians at Olympics and World Championships for more than a decade. Figure skating is another popular sport in Russia; in the 1960s, the Soviet Union rose to become a dominant power in figure skating, especially in pair skating and ice dancing, and at every Winter Olympics from 1964 until 2006, a Soviet or Russian pair has won gold, often considered the longest winning streak in modern sports history. Since the end of the Soviet era, tennis has grown in popularity and Russia has produced a number of famous tennis players. Chess is also a widely popular pastime; from 1927, Soviet and Russian chess grandmasters have held the world championship almost continuously.\n\nAs the Soviet Union, Russia was traditionally very strong in basketball, winning Olympic tournaments, World Championships and Eurobasket. As of 2009 they have various players in the NBA, notably Utah Jazz forward Andrei Kirilenko, and are considered as a worldwide basketball force. In 2007, Russia defeated world champions Spain to win Eurobasket 2007. Russian basketball clubs such as PBC CSKA Moscow (numerous Euroleague Champions) have also had great success in European competitions such as the Euroleague and the ULEB Cup.\n\nAlthough ice hockey was only introduced during the Soviet era, the national team soon dominated the sport internationally, winning gold at seven of the nine Olympics and 19 of the 30 World Championships they contested between 1954 and 1991. Russian players Valeri Kharlamov, Sergei Makarov, Viacheslav Fetisov and Vladislav Tretiak hold four of the six positions on the IIHF Team of the Century. As with some other sports, the Russian ice hockey programme suffered after the breakup of the Soviet Union, with Russia enduring a 15-year gold medal drought. At that time many prominent Russian players made their careers in the National Hockey League (NHL). In recent years Russia has reemerged as a hockey power, winning back to back gold medals in the 2008 and 2009 World Championships, and overtaking Team Canada as the top ranked ice hockey team in the world, but then lost to Canada in the quarter-finals of the 2010 Olympics and 2010 World Junior Championship. The Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) was founded in 2008 as a rival of the NHL.\n\nBandy, known in Russian as \"hockey with a ball\" and sometimes informally as \"Russian hockey\" (as opposed to \"Canadian hockey\", an informal name for ice hockey), is another traditionally popular ice sport, with national league games averaging around 3,500 spectators. It's considered a national sport. The Soviet Union national bandy team won all the Bandy World Championships from 1957 to 1979. The Russian team is the reigning world champion since the 2014 tournament, having defended the title in 2015.\n\nDuring the Soviet period, Russia was also a competitive footballing nation. Despite having legendary players such as goalkeeper of the century Lev Yashin, the USSR never really managed to assert itself as one of the major forces of international football, although its teams won various championships (such as Euro 1960) and reached numerous finals (such as Euro 1988). Along with ice hockey and basketball, football is one of the most popular sports in modern Russia. In recent years, Russian football, which downgraded in 1990-s, has experienced a revival. Russian clubs (such as CSKA Moscow, Zenit St Petersburg, Lokomotiv Moscow, and Spartak Moscow) are becoming increasingly successful on the European stage (CSKA and Zenit winning the UEFA Cup in 2005 and 2008 respectively). The Russian national football team reached the semi-finals of Euro 2008, losing only to eventual champions Spain. The nation also hosted the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup as well as the 2018 FIFA World Cup at which the national team lost in the Quarterfinals 4–2 on penalty kicks to Croatia, their best ever finish as an independent nation.\n\nRussia has an extensive history of martial arts. Some of its best-known forms include the fistfight, Sambo, and Systema with its derivatives Ryabko's Systema and Retuinskih's System ROSS. Undefeated lightweight UFC champion Khabib Nurmagomedov is from Makhachkala and was called by President Vladimir Putin following his victory over Conor McGregor.\n\nState symbols of Russia include the Byzantine double-headed eagle, combined with St. George of Moscow in the Russian coat of arms; these symbols date from the time of the Grand Duchy of Moscow. The Russian flag appeared in the late Tsardom of Russia period and became widely used during the era of the Russian Empire. The current Russian national anthem shares its music with the Soviet Anthem, though not the lyrics (many Russians of older generations don't know the new lyrics and sing the old ones). The Russian imperial motto \"God is with us\" and the Soviet motto \"Proletarians of all countries, unite!\" are now obsolete and no new motto has been officially introduced to replace them. The Hammer and sickle and the full Soviet coat of arms are still widely seen in Russian cities as a part of old architectural decorations. Soviet Red Stars are also encountered, often on military equipment and war memorials. The Soviet Red Banner is still honored, especially the Banner of Victory of 1945.\nThe Matryoshka doll is a recognizable symbol of Russia, while the towers of Moscow Kremlin and Saint Basil's Cathedral in Moscow are main Russia's architectural symbols. Cheburashka is a mascot of Russian national Olympic team. Mary, Saint Nicholas, Saint Andrew, Saint George, Saint Alexander Nevsky, Saint Sergius of Radonezh, Saint Seraphim of Sarov are Russia's patron saints. Chamomile is a flower that Russians often associate with their Motherland, while birch is a national tree. The Russian bear is an animal often associated with Russia, though this image has Western origins and Russians themselves do not consider it as a special symbol. The native Russian national personification is \"Родина мать\" Mother Motherland (the statue of it located on the Mamay hill \"Мамаев курган\" in Volgograd /former Stalingrad/), called Mother Russia at the West.\n\nTourism in Russia has seen rapid growth since the late Soviet times, first inner tourism and then international tourism as well. Rich cultural heritage and great natural variety place Russia among the most popular tourist destinations in the world. The country contains 29 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, while many more are on UNESCO's tentative lists. Major tourist routes in Russia include a travel around the Golden Ring of ancient cities, cruises on the big rivers like Volga, and long journeys on the famous Trans-Siberian Railway. Diverse regions and ethnic cultures of Russia offer many different food and souvenirs, and show a great variety of traditions, like Russian banya, Tatar Sabantuy, or Siberian shamanist rituals.\n\nMost popular tourist destinations in Russia are Moscow and Saint Petersburg, the current and the former capitals of the country and great cultural centers, recognized as World Cities. Moscow and Saint Petersburg feature such world-renowned museums as Tretyakov Gallery and Hermitage, famous theaters like Bolshoi and Mariinsky, ornate churches like Saint Basil's Cathedral, Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, Saint Isaac's Cathedral and Church of the Savior on Blood, impressive fortifications like Moscow Kremlin and Peter and Paul Fortress, beautiful squares like Red Square and Palace Square, and streets like Tverskaya and Nevsky Prospect. Rich palaces and parks of extreme beauty are found in the former in suburbs of Moscow (Kolomenskoye, Tsaritsyno) and Saint Petersburg (Peterhof, Strelna, Oranienbaum, Gatchina, Pavlovsk Palace, Tsarskoye Selo). Moscow contains a great variety of impressive Soviet-era buildings along with modern skyscrapers, while Saint Petersburg, nicknamed \"Venice of the North\", boasts of its classical architecture, many rivers, channels and bridges.\n\nKazan, the capital of Tatarstan, shows a unique mix of Christian Russian and Muslim Tatar cultures. The city has registered a brand \"The Third Capital of Russia\", though a number of other major Russian cities compete for this status, like Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg and Nizhny Novgorod, all being major cultural centers with rich history and prominent architecture. Veliky Novgorod, Pskov and the cities of Golden Ring (Vladimir, Yaroslavl, Kostroma and others) have at best preserved the architecture and the spirit of ancient and medieval Rus', and also are among the main tourist destinations. Many old fortifications (typically Kremlins), monasteries and churches are scattered throughout Russia, forming its unique cultural landscape both in big cities and in remote areas.\n\nThe warm subtropical Black Sea coast of Russia is the site for a number of popular sea resorts, like Sochi, known for its beaches and wonderful nature. At the same time Sochi can boast a number of major ski resorts, like Krasnaya Polyana; the city is the host of 2014 Winter Olympics and the 2014 Winter Paralympics. The mountains of the Northern Caucasus contain many other popular ski resorts, like Dombay in Karachay–Cherkessia.\n\nThe most famous natural tourist destination in Russia is Lake Baikal, named \"the Blue Eye of Siberia\". This unique lake, oldest and deepest in the world, has crystal-clean waters and is surrounded by taiga-covered mountains.\n\nOther popular natural destinations include Kamchatka with its volcanoes and geysers, Karelia with its many lakes and granite rocks, Altai with its snowy mountains and Tyva with its wild steppes.\n\n\n"}

He created bills signed into law that would allow for the state takeover of failing school districts and the requirement that 11th grade high school students pass a standardized test (High School Proficiency Assessment) to graduate high school.\n\nHe was elected to the State Senate in 1989, defeating the appointed incumbent Democrat John D'Amico, Jr. After taking the office on November 20, he served in a variety of leadership roles. From 1992 to 1993, Palaia was the Assistant Majority Leader and from 1994 to 2003 he was President Pro Tempore of the Senate. In 2002-2003 he was the Republican President Pro Tempore when the Senate was evenly split 20-20. Palaia was a member of the Senate Education Committee. He was one of the sponsors of the New Jersey Childproof Handgun Law that passed in 2002.\n\nPalaia was married to the former Wedell Simon from 1956 until her death. Together, they had two children: son Joseph Jr. (1959 – 2016) and daughter Denise who has followed her father into education and is principal of Wayside Elementary School.

(Bob) Carver is an American designer of audio equipment based in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nEducated as a physicist and engineer, he found an interest in audio equipment at a young age. He applied his talent to produce numerous innovative high fidelity designs since the 1970s. He is known for designing the Phase Linear 700, at 350 W per channel the most powerful consumer audio amplifier available in 1972. He went on to found the Carver Corporation in 1979, Sunfire in 1994, and the Bob Carver LLC in 2011 which was sold to Jade Design in June, 2013.\nHowever, in December 2013, Bob Carver and Jade Design parted ways.\n\nCarver caused a stir in the industry in the mid-1980s when he challenged two high-end audio magazines to give him any audio amplifier at any price, and he’d duplicate its sound in one of his lower cost (and usually much more powerful) designs. Two magazines accepted the challenge.\n\nFirst, \"The Audio Critic\" chose a Mark Levinson ML-2 which Bob acoustically copied (transfer function duplication) and sold as his M1.5t amplifier (the “t” stood for transfer function modified).\n\nIn 1985, \"Stereophile\" magazine challenged Bob to copy a Conrad-Johnson Premier Four (the make and model was not named then, but revealed later) amplifier at their offices in New Mexico within 48 hours. The Conrad Johnson amplifiers were one of the most highly regarded amplifiers of the day, costing in excess of $6,000 a pair.\n\nOf note that in both cases, the challenging amplifier could only be treated as a “black box” and could not even have its lid removed. Nevertheless, Carver, using null difference testing, (null difference testing consists of driving two different amplifiers with identical signal sources and exact levels, but out of phase by exactly 180 degrees. If the amplifiers were 100% identical, no sound would be heard. If sound was heard, the audio amps had different properties). Bob Carver used \"distortion pots\" to introduce amplifier characteristics, fine-tuned to null-out any sound differences. His \"motel-room\" modified amplifier sound was so similar, Stereophile Magazine editors could not tell the difference between his amplifier and one costing more than $6,000. This amplifier was marketed as the M1.0t for about $400.00. Bob Carver may have single-handedly debunked any number of theories about sound quality by using physics, blind and double-blind testing and unbiased measurements (such as \"gold-plated speaker wires sound better than copper wires\", etc.). Carver successfully copied the sound of the target amplifier and won the challenge. The \"Stereophile\" employees failed to pass a single blind test with their own equipment in their own listening room. He marketed “t” versions of his amplifiers incorporating the sound of the Mark Levinson and Conrad Johnson designs which caused him some criticism by those who failed to understand the true nature of the challenge — that it was possible to duplicate an audio amplifier's sound in two completely dissimilar designs. In light of this criticism, Carver went on to design the Silver Seven, the most expensive and esoteric conventional amplifier up to that time and duplicated its sound in his M 4.0t and later models which sold for some 1/40th the price (around $600–$1500).\n\nThis also started Carver's departure from the M-series amplifier to the more robust and current-pushing TFM series amplifiers. The TFM amplifiers were designed specifically to drive the demanding load of the Amazing ribbon loudspeakers. The apex of Carver's amplifier line was the Lightstar, which is now a collectors' item. Only approximately 100 of the amplifiers were made. The original Lightstar amplifier, called the Lightstar Reference, featured a dual-monoblock design, with separate power cords for each channel. A later version, called the Lightstar 2.0, featured one power cord & other cost-saving measures to shave approximately $1800 off the retail price. The two are reported to be sonically identical.\n\nCarver also later sued \"Stereophile\" magazine for its alleged bias against Carver products. (\"Stereophile\" had first filed suit against Carver for reprinting the magazine's copyrighted material without authorization.) The case was arbitrated with neither side awarded damages.\n\nCarver has used some names in marketing which have other technical definitions:\n\n\nThe information on Carver products comes from Carver product brochures and manuals. Carver's career has been extensively covered by audio industry magazines including \"Stereophile\", \"Audio\", \"High Fidelity\", and \"Stereo Review\".\n\n\n"}

It is best to refer to him using the usual 16th-century Latin term \"mathematicus\", as the areas of study to which he devoted his life were very different from those now considered to be the domain of the mathematician. He was a priest, astronomer, astrologer, geographer, cosmographer, cartographer, mathematician, globe and scientific instrument maker and editor and publisher of scientific tests. In his own time he enjoyed a European wide reputation as an innovative and influential globe maker and cosmographer and as one of the continent's leading and most authoritative astrologers. Today he is remembered as an influential pioneer in the history of globe making and as a man who played a significant role in the events that led up to the publishing of Copernicus' \"De revolutionibus\" in Nürnberg in 1543.\n\nSchöner was born on 16 January 1477 in Karlstadt am Main in Lower Franconia. As with most Renaissance scholars nothing is known about his parents or his early life. All that is known is that he had a brother, Peter, to whom he addressed his \"Arzneibuch\" in 1528. Quite detailed information for Schöner’s adult life, at least up to 1506, has been preserved in his own marginalia in his copy of Regiomontanus' printed Ephemerides, which he used as a diary. He matriculated at the University of Erfurt in the winter semester 1494/5 and graduated Baccalaureus on 21 March 1498. He was appointed to a position in the school in Gemünden on 22 February 1499 and ordained as a Catholic priest in the Bishopric of Bamberg on 13 June 1500. On 2 February 1500 he moved to Bamberg and was appointed chaplain in Hallstatt near Bamberg on 18 April 1500. His next appointment was as vicar in his hometown Karlstadt from 4 June 1504. Between 4 May and 29 October 1506 he was again in Bamberg before he returned to Karlstadt. His diary also informs us that he entered a relationship with Kunigunde Holocher in 1499, with whom he had three children: a son Johannes born on 1 February 1502, a daughter Sibilla born on 12 June 1503 and a second son Vitus born on 21 November 1504.\nSchöner was the owner of the only specimen of the 1507 Waldseemüller map of the world that has survived and which was rediscovered at Schloss Wolfegg in Upper Swabia in 1901. Since 2003 it is in possession of the Library of Congress.\n\nNo diary exists after 1506, and up to 1515 there are only indirect traces of Schöner's existence in the financial records of the bishopric and in the correspondence of Lorenz Beheim (?1457 - 1521), who after 24 years in Rome as chamberlain to Pope Alexander IV had returned to Bamberg in 1505 as a canon of the cathedral.\n\n1526, he was called to Nürnberg as the first professor of mathematics at the newly founded gymnasium \"Aegidianum\", a post he held till one year prior to his death. At the same time, he converted to Protestantism and married.\n\nAlready in Bamberg, he owned his own printing company and published many maps and globes. The very first printed globe of the sky was made in his workshop in 1515. He made another globe in 1520.\n\nSchöner had also made still unpublished data of Mercury observations from Walther available to Copernicus, 45 observations in total, 14 of them with longitude and latitude. Copernicus used three of them in \"De revolutionibus\", giving only longitudes, and falsely attributing them to Schöner. The values differed slightly from the ones published by Schöner in 1544.\n\n1538, Georg Joachim Rheticus, a young professor of mathematics at Wittenberg and former assistant of Copernicus, stayed for some time with Schöner who convinced him to visit Nicolaus Copernicus in Frauenburg. In 1540, Rheticus dedicated the first published report of Copernicus work, the \"Narratio prima\", to Schöner, to test the waters of the reaction by the Catholic Church. As this was well received, Copernicus finally agreed to publish his main work, and Rheticus prepared Copernicus' manuscript for printing.\n\nIn Nürnberg, Schöner published in 1544 the astronomical observations of Regiomontanus and Walther, as well as manuscripts of Regiomontanus, which had been in the hand of Walther, as \"Observationes XXX annorum a I. Regiomontano et B. Walthero Norimbergae habitae, [4°, Norimb. 1544].\"\n\nA crater on Mars is named in his honor.\n\n\nFrom the Lessing J. Rosenwald Collection at the Library of Congress:\n"}

The word \"Jäger\" (meaning \"hunter\" or \"huntsman\") is a characteristic term used for light-infantry or light-infantryman in a continental European military context.\n\nThe mountain infantry of Austria have their roots in the three \"Landesschützen\" regiments of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The mountain infantry of Germany carry on certain traditions of the Alpenkorps (Alpine corps) of World War I. Both countries' mountain infantry share the Edelweiß insignia. It was established in 1907 as a symbol of the Austro-Hungarian \"Landesschützen\" regiments by Emperor Franz Joseph I. These troops wore their edelweiss on the collar of their uniforms. When the \"Alpenkorps\" came to aid the \"Landesschützen\" in defending Austria-Hungary's southern frontier against the Italian attack in May 1915, the grateful \"Landesschützen\" honoured the men of the \"Alpenkorps\" by awarding them their own insignia: the edelweiss. Together with the Fallschirmjäger (Paratroopers) they are perceived as the elite infantry units of the German Army.\n\nDuring World War II the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS raised a number of mountain infantry units.\n\nAn entire corps was formed in Norway by 1941. Its divisions were lightly equipped, with much of the transport provided by mules. These mountain infantry were equipped with fewer automatic weapons than regular infantry, however the MG 34 or MG 42 machine gunners were provided with more ammunition than their regular infantry counterparts. Mountain infantry were identified by the edelweiss insignia worn on their sleeves and their caps.\n\nMountain infantry participated in many battles, including Operation Weserübung, Operation Silver Fox, Operation Platinum Fox and Operation Arctic Fox, the operations in the Caucasus, the Gothic Line, the invasion of Crete and the battles in the Vosges region of France. Special equipment was made for them including the G33/40 mauser rifle based on the VZ.33 rifle.\n\n\n\nHonouring tradition, upon the creation of the Bundeswehr in 1956, the mountain infantry returned as a distinctive arm of the West German army. Until 2001, they were organized as the 1. Gebirgsdivision, but this division was disbanded in a general reform. The successor unit is Gebirgsjägerbrigade 23 which has its headquarters in Bad Reichenhall. The battalions of these mountain infantry are deployed in southern Bavaria as this is the only high mountain area in Germany touching the Northern Alps. Since 2008 the unit is officially called \"Gebirgsjägerbrigade 23 \"Bayern\" (Bavaria)\" as a commendation of the close relationship between the state and the \"Gebirgsjäger\".\n\nAccording to the official Bundeswehr website, the brigade has a current strength of 6,500 soldiers.\n\nThe soldiers of the mountain infantry wear a grey cap (\"Bergmütze\") with an edelweiß on its left side, stem to the front. This distinguishes them from all other German army soldiers who wear berets and the Austrian army, whose edelweiß has its stem to the back. The formal uniform, which is based on traditional alpine mountain climbing trekking outfits (\"Berganzug\"), is also different from the standard mainstream German army uniform, and consists of a light-weight grey ski blouse (\"Skibluse\"), black Stirrup trousers (\"Keilhose\") or especially during the summer periods \"Culottes\" knee-breeches (\"\") similar to knickerbockers, and ankle-height mountaineering boots (\"\") or dual-use mountaineering ski boots. A soldier is allowed to wear the edelweiß on the forage cap after he has completed the \"Edelweißmarsch\". This honor is only allowed for the mountain infantry.\n\nGerman \"Gebirgsjäger\" traditionally share a very close comradeship and distinct esprit de corps. There is also a special perception of discipline which can for example be seen in a relatively informal relationship between officers and soldiers during normal day duty.\n\nThe main tasks of the German mountain infantry are:\n\n\nThe structure of the 23rd Gebirgsjägerbrigade is as of May 2020:\n\n\nMountain units which are not part of the Gebirgsjägerbrigade 23:\n\nAs the Gebirgsjägerbrigade 23 is part of the so-called stabilisation forces (\"Stabilisierungskräfte\"), it lacks any accompanying artillery. Mortar support is provided by the \"Schwere Jägerkompanie\" (heavy infantry company) in every mountain infantry battalion.\n\nA mountain infantry battalion consists of about 900 soldiers in five companies. One company is responsible for staff and support duties and has a \"Hochgebirgsjägerzug\" (special platoon for high mountain fight and reconnaissance) at its disposal. Three companies are consisting of classical mountain infantry, another one is a heavy company which is equipped with the Wiesel AWC for mortar support, tank defence and supporting cannon fire with 20 mm guns. Two of the three mountain infantry battalions are equipped with the Hägglund 206S, one with the GTK Boxer.\n\n\nToday the traditions of the Austrian mountain infantry are maintained by the 6th Jägerbrigade in western Austria\n\nList of active mountain infantry in the Austrian Armed Forces :\n\nAlso see Alpenkorps for the World War I era unit.\n\n\n\n"}

He is one of only eight Iranians to score in a World Cup. His position was usually the central defender. He was a member of Iranian national football team and played most of his career in Persepolis. He previously managed some big clubs in Iran like Naft Tehran, Zob Ahan, Tractor Sazi and Shahr-e Khodro.\n\nHe was born on 19 March 1971 in Minabad Ardabil Province where, as a youngster was recognized for his footballing talent.\n\nYahya Golmohammadi played most of his professional career for Persepolis. He made his debut as a football player in 1989 with Tractor Sazi. Two years later, he signed with Poora. He played in Poora for four years and later signed with Persepolis in 1995 and began his work with Stanko Poklepović and won the league in his first season. In 1999, he moved to Ahvaz based club Foolad, but returned to Persepolis after only three seasons. In 2005, Yahya left Persepolis for a lucrative contract with Saba Battery, many critics were skeptical about his success in this newly formed team, but Saba Battery, with the help of Golmohammadi and Iranian national teammate Ali Daei, surprised everyone by winning the Hazfi Cup, and also did extremely well in the Asian Champions League, beating more experienced and seasoned campaigners. He played for Saba until 2008 when he announced his retirement as a football player.\n\nGolmohammadi was a reliable defender with a cool approach to the game and slide tackles that became his hallmark. He has been immensely popular with Iranian fans after he scored the last minute winner in a 2002 World Cup qualifying game against Republic of Ireland, coming deep to head the ball home though Iran lost the game in aggregate and failed to qualify for the Korea/Japan World Cup. His emotions after the game were a dramatic scene that very few die-hard fans will forget.\n\nOn 11 June 2006, Golmohammadi scored the equaliser in a 3–1 loss to Mexico in the opening round of the 2006 FIFA World Cup. His tackle against Luís Figo in the next game against Portugal cost Iran a penalty. Golmohammadi was injured in the same game and was not available for Iran's final World Cup game versus Angola. He retired from international football immediately after World Cup 2006. He has 74 caps for the senior team and scored five times during his international duty.\n\nHe was also a member of Iran national under-23 football team in 2002 Asian Games which Iran won the football tournament under Branko Ivanković.\n\nAfter the resignation of Mohammad Hossein Ziaei as the head coach of Saba Battery, Golmohammadi was named as his successor to lead the team for the ensuing fixtures. Golmohammadi led Saba in the remaining ten matches and led them to a third-place finish behind Persepolis and Sepahan which is the best result for Saba in Iran Pro League in the club's history. There were many rumors that Golmohammadi would continue to lead Saba for the following season but he refused to extend his contract. Firouz Karimi succeeded him as head coach of Saba in June 2008.\n\nIn July 2008, Golmohammadi took over the Azadegan League side Tarbiat Yazd. His team started the 2008–09 season with three consecutive wins but at the end of the season, Tarbiat finished at 5th place of Group B and were not promoted to the Iran Pro League. He continued his work with Tarbiat Yazd the following season and led the team to a third-place finish but were shy one point of qualifying for a promotion play-off. At the end of the season, he resigned as head coach of Tarbiat Yazd in order to become head coach of another Azadegan league side, Nassaji Mazandaran.\n\nHe became head coach of his native town team, Nassaji Mazandaran in July 2010. He was also unable to promote Nassaji to the Iran Pro League as they finished at 4th place in the 2010–11 season. He was sacked by the club in September 2011.\n\nAfter Ali Daei became head coach of Rah Ahan, he was chosen by his former teammate as first team coach. Yahya worked with Daei for one season as his assistant along with Željko Mijač but separated from the Rah Ahan coaching staff at the end of the season in order to take over the reins of Saba Qom for the second time.\n\nAfter Abdollah Veisi left the team for Paykan, Golmohammadi was named as head coach of Saba for a second time and returned to the club where he began his coaching career after four years. Golmohammadi signed a one-year contract with the club. His first match was a 4–0 win over Paykan which placed Saba at the top of the league. They stayed at the top the following week as well. They also defeated Persepolis 2–0 at the Azadi Stadium. The day after, Saba defeated Gahar Zagros 1–0. However, Golmohammadi was transferred to a hospital due to heart complications. He resigned on 24 September 2012 as head coach of Saba Qom due to health problems. His team was in 7th place before his departure.\nOn 25 September 2012, Persepolis officials announced that Golmohammadi would become the assistant coach of Manuel José instead of Mohsen Ashouri. He officially began his work on 26 September. On 7 December 2012, Golmohammadi was promoted to the first team as the caretaker manager after Jose was banned from training camp by club president Mohammad Rouyanian. Three days later, he was confirmed as the club's head coach and signed a contract with the club until the end of the season. He appointed Vinko Begović and Karim Bagheri as his new assistant managers at Persepolis.\n\nHis first game in charge of Persepolis came in a Hazfi Cup match against Malavan which his team won 6–0 with a hat-trick from Karim Ansarifard, two goals from Hadi Norouzi and a final goal from Gholamreza Rezaei. His side won their other three matches in Hazfi Cup to qualified to the final, when they lose in penalties to Sepahan. His first game for Persepolis in Iran Pro League was ended 2–2 against Sanat Naft with two early goals from Ali Karimi and Mohammad Nouri. With a 2–0 victory against Fajr Sepasi, Golmohammadi presiding over his first league win as manager of Persepolis. He then led Persepolis to an eleventh undefeated streak until 1–0 lose to Rah Ahan on 10 March 2013. When he became head coach, Persepolis was in 12th place and he moved to sixth place in Iran Pro League table. Persepolis finished the season in the seventh place. He was offered by club officials a two years extension which was close to sign but after Hazfi Cup final, he refused to sign and his managerial rule at Persepolis was finished on 11 May 2013.\n\nOn 20 May 2013, Yahya signed a one-year contract with Naft Tehran, replacing Mansour Ebrahimzadeh. His side began the season with a 1–0 away win against Fajr Sepasi. Naft Tehran finished the 2013–14 Iran Pro League in 3rd place, qualified to the AFC Champions League play-offs that marked the club's best position in its history. Golmohammadi left Naft Tehran to Zob Ahan by mutual consent on 10 May 2014, after only one season in charge of the team.\n\nOn 10 May 2014, Zob Ahan announced on their official website that Yahya Golmohammadi signed a two-year deal with the Isfahani outfit. Despite a disappointing start, Zob Ahan began their successful run from the January 2015. They finished the league in the 4th place, securing AFC Champions League spot. They also won Hazfi Cup after defeating Naft Tehran in the final. The title was the first major trophy that Golmohammadi won since he started his managerial career. Zob Ahan also won the title in next year for the second season in row, by defeating Esteghlal in the final.\n\nOn 24 September 2016, Golmohammadi parted away with Zob Ahan after a poor start of the season, which placed Zob Ahan in the 14th position.\n\nOn 29 December 2016, Golmohammadi agreed to a two-and-a-half-year deal to coach the Oxin.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Brooks (October 18, 1906 – March 9, 1992) was an American muralist, abstract painter, and winner of the Logan Medal of the Arts.\n\nBrooks was born in St. Louis, Missouri and attended Southern Methodist University and the Dallas Art Institute and moved to New York in 1926 where he attended night classes at the Art Students League. \n\nBetween 1942 and 1945, Brooks was enlisted as a combat artist with the American military. Based in Cairo, he traveled to Palestine, Benghazi, Libya, and other parts of Egypt during this time, photographing American military camps, the aftermath of combat, and locals. From these photographs, he created a series of drawings and gouache paintings that were then submitted to the army. Upon returning to the U.S. in 1946, he worked in Washington D.C., where he first met artist Charlotte Park.\n\nBrooks was a friend of Jackson Pollock and Lee Krasner and would move into Pollock's Greenwich Village apartment at 46 East 8th Street after Pollock and Krasner moved to Springs, New York in East Hampton, New York.\n\nIn 1947 he married artist Charlotte Park. They also moved to East Hampton in 1949 creating a studio at Rocky Point in Montauk, New York. The Montauk studio and several of Brooks paintings were destroyed in Hurricane Carol with the studio being blown off a hill in 1954. Brooks then had their house which was not damaged towed by barge across to Springs where it was located on an 11-acre parcel on Neck Path close to Pollock's home. Brooks and Park had no children and their property after the house and studios were left vacant was sold to East Hampton in 2013 with the town planning to tear it down. The town reconsidered their decision in February 2017 to tear down following a local campaign to restore the compound and instead announced plans to restore the studio and house. Town officials noted Brooks paint cans were still in the studio.\n\nConsidered a first generation abstract expressionist painter, Brooks was among the first abstract expressionists to use staining as an important technique. According to art critic Carter Ratcliff, \"His concern has always been to create painterly \"accidents\" of the kind that allow buried personal meanings to take on visibility.\" In his paintings from the late 1940s Brooks began to dilute his oil paint in order to stain the mostly raw canvas. These works often combined calligraphy and abstract shapes.\n\nBrooks had his first one-man exhibition of his abstract expressionist paintings in 1949 at the Peridot Gallery in New York. His work was displayed in the 9th Street Art Exhibition in 1951.\n\nPublic collections holding works by James Brooks include: the Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State Plaza Art Collection (Albany, NY), Courtauld Institute of Art (London), the Dallas Museum of Art (Dallas, Texas), the Museum of Modern Art (New York, NY), the Harvard University Art Museums, the Whitney Museum of American Art (New York, NY), the Honolulu Museum of Art, the Indianapolis Museum of Art (Indianapolis, Indiana), the Sheldon Art Gallery (Lincoln, Nebraska), the Smithsonian American Art Museum (Washington D.C.), the Tate Gallery (London) and the Walker Art Center (Minneapolis, Minnesota). His works were also exhibited by galleries including the Anita Shapolsky Gallery in New York City, the Peridot Gallery in New York, and Washburn Gallery in New York.\n\nBrooks worked as a commercial letterer and display artist to support himself.\n\nBrooks participated in the Federal Art Project through the US Department of the Treasury's Section of Fine Arts between 1936 and 1942. By submitting design proposals to several competitions, he was able to secure three significant public works commissions. Between 1938 and 1942, he painted a 235-foot mural entitled \"Flight\" around the rotunda of the Marine Air Terminal at La Guardia Airport. A 1937 mural painted in a public library in Woodside, Queens was destroyed in the 1960s. The only other surviving mural by Brooks is located in the Little Falls Civic Center in New Jersey. Titled \"Labor and Leisure\" the Little Falls mural was completed in 1938. His Marine Air Terminal mural was painted over by the Port Authority in the 1950s but was restored in 1980.\n\n\n\n\"Smithsonian Institution Research Information System; Archival, Manuscript and Photographic Collections, James Brooks\"\n\n\n"}

It is the fifth-largest public hospital in the United States, as well as one of the busiest Level I trauma centers in the country. Historical segregation of its hospital units meant that it was also called \"The Gradys,\" a name that still surfaces among elderly Atlanta residents, especially African-Americans. Located downtown next to the campus of Georgia State University, Grady is considered to be one of the premier public hospitals in the United States. It is named for Henry W. Grady, an \"Atlanta Constitution\" journalist and later owner who became a major force in Georgia politics, and advocated for a public city hospital. It is now the flagship of the Grady Health System.\n\nGrady Memorial Hospital was first founded in 1890 and opened in 1892, as an outgrowth of the Atlanta Benevolent Home. At the time of opening, the hospital officially had 14 rooms. The original building (at 36 Butler Street) is now on the National Register of Historic Places and is known as Georgia Hall, where the hospital's human resources staff now work. The second Grady Hospital at Butler Hall, opened in 1912 and was for whites only, with blacks being segregated at the Atlanta Medical College. The third hospital was at Hirsch Hall, and the current location is its fourth. From 1945 until 2008, the hospital was run by the Fulton/DeKalb Hospital Authority.\n\nThe current facility was also built as a segregated institution, with one section serving whites (Wings A & B; facing the city) and another section serving African-Americans (Wings C & D; facing the opposite direction). Even though it is a single building and the two sides are connected by a hallway (Wing E), the facility was referred to in the plural (\"The Gradys\") during the years of segregation.\n\nCNN's medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, who is Associate Chief of Neurosurgery at Grady, filmed a documentary at the hospital called \"Grady's Anatomy\" (a play on \"Grey's Anatomy\") that aired in 2007 for \"CNN Special Investigations Unit\". The documentary focused on four young medical residents and the daily stress of a large hospital practice.\n\nIn 2007 and 2008, journalist Mike King of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote a series of \"Saving Grady\" editorials – dozens of pieces over eighteen months – during the time when Grady Memorial Hospital was nearly insolvent and in danger of closing.\n\nIn the fifth season of AMC's The Walking Dead, Grady Memorial became a major setting for several episodes of the show's fifth season in 2014. However, none of the series' scenes were filmed at the actual hospital.\n\nOn August 11, 1949, \"Gone with the Wind\" author Margaret Mitchell was hit by a speeding car while crossing Peachtree Street with her husband on the way to a movie. She was knocked unconscious and was taken to Grady. X-rays showed that her skull was fractured from the top of her head all the way down to her spine and her pelvis was shattered. She never regained consciousness, and died five days later at Grady, on August 16, 1949. The driver, who had 23 prior traffic violations, was thought to be drunk and was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and served an 11-month jail term.\n\nIn 2001, actor Whitman Mayo, who played the character Grady on television's \"Sanford and Son\", died of a heart attack at Grady.\n\nGrady Hospital gained national attention for treating supermodel Niki Taylor after her near-fatal car accident on April 29, 2001 in which she suffered severe liver trauma. The hospital's effectiveness as a level I trauma center has been highlighted by this incident. Several press conferences were held outside the hospital discussing the gravity of her injuries and then her slow recovery following more than 50 surgeries.\n\nIt again gained attention after the Bluffton University bus accident in which seven died. The hospital cleared an entire wing of the hospital for the injured victims and their families.\n\nThe hospital serves a large proportion of low-income patients. Grady sued the state over lack of Medicaid compensation in 2004. Grady relies almost entirely on Emory University School of Medicine and Morehouse School of Medicine to provide doctor and resident staffing. As an editorial in \"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\" said, \"When you read the phrase 'Grady doctor,' do a silent translation, because those words really mean either 'Emory doctor' or 'Morehouse doctor.'\"\n\nGrady Hospital's ambulance service, Grady EMS, shares 9-1-1 responsibility for Fulton County, Georgia. The Downtown Connector (Interstate 75/85) makes a large bend around the hospital on its otherwise due north-south route, dubbed the \"Grady Curve\" on traffic reports.\n\nThe hospital serves a large proportion of low-income patients and is supported almost entirely by Fulton and DeKalb counties, with little help from the suburbs or state, despite serving all of metro Atlanta's several counties.\n\nThe hospital board has long been reluctant to make money-saving changes that might reduce its traditional mission. In late 2006, it rejected the advice of financial consultants and its newly hired chief executive to close an expensive outpatient dialysis clinic for the poor, being concerned that many of the clinic's uninsured patients, including many illegal immigrants, would have nowhere else to turn. Others argued that the board of directors are politically clumsy, and prone to micromanagement. In May the board's own consultants concluded that \"Grady does not currently have the depth of leadership\" necessary to transform the hospital.\n\nIn 2008, Grady Memorial Hospital was made into a non-profit organization. Numerous foundations have pledged hundreds of millions of dollars to revitalize it. Michael Young beat out three other contenders for the position of chief executive officer. He was formerly the CEO of Erie County Medical Center Corp. in Western New York, University of Buffalo tertiary center. Prior to that, Young served for 16 years as president and CEO of the three-hospital, 530-bed Lancaster General Hospital & Health System in Lancaster, Penn. Young also served for eight years as vice president of operations for Shadyside Hospital, a 484-bed hospital associated with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn February 2013, it was announced that Grady's net profit was $20 million and that 200-300 jobs had been added at the hospital in the preceding 18 months.\n\nOn March 14, 2008, the buildings of Grady sustained minor damage when a tornado tore through downtown Atlanta. Historic Georgia Hall was the hardest hit, with windows blown out, a chimney that collapsed and water damage. The main hospital had a few cafeteria windows blown out, but never lost power. It was the first tornado to hit the downtown area since local weather record keeping began in the 1880s. Nine people were taken to Grady for treatment, one of whom had critical injuries.\n\n\n"}

On 1 January 2013 the former municipalities of Gallenkirch, Linn, Oberbözberg and Unterbözberg merged to form the new municipality of Bözberg.\n\nGallenkirch is first mentioned in 1338 as \"Gallenkilch\". During the Middle Ages, Gallenkirch was part of the district of Hornussen under the city of Bad Säckingen. Religiously, until the Reformation the residents were also part of the parish of Hornussen. The local chapel was dedicated to Saint Gall, but is no longer standing. Portions of the structure were incorporated into a later building. After the Reformation the village became part of the reformed parish of Bözberg. Under Bernese rule (1460-1798) the village was part of the Thalheim court. In the 19th and 20th century, several attempts to merge Gallenkirch into the village of Linn failed. However, since 1917, children attend the local school in Linn, and other infrastructure problems are solved through inter-municipal cooperation. In Gallenkirch there is no shopping or other economy. Today's inhabitants are farmers or commuters to the nearby industrial centers.\n\nGallenkirch had an area, , of . Of this area, or 74.3% is used for agricultural purposes, while or 18.6% is forested.

Gallenkirch is from downtown Brugg, the district seat. The municipality is bounded with Unterbözberg in the northeast, Linn to the south and Effingen to the northeast.\n\nThe blazon of the municipal coat of arms is \"Per pale Or a Trunk couped ragully proper and Azure a Latin Cross patte couped Or.\" The trunk of wood is from Saint Gall, who according to legend carried a wooden staff, while the cross is for the Gallus Chapel, from which the village derives its name.\n\nGallenkirch had a population () of 133. , 6.5% of the population are foreign nationals. Over the last 10 years (1997–2007) the population has changed at a rate of 31.1%.

{"id": "2012548", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2012548", "title": "Parliament of Scotland", "text": "Parliament of Scotland\n\nThe Parliament of Scotland was the legislature of the Kingdom of Scotland. The parliament, like other such institutions, evolved during the Middle Ages from the king's council of bishops and earls. It is first identifiable as a parliament in 1235, during the reign of Alexander II, when it was described as a \"colloquium\" and already possessed a political and judicial role. By the early 14th century, the attendance of knights and freeholders had become important, and from 1326 commissioners from the burghs attended. Consisting of the \"three estates\" of clergy, nobility and the burghs sitting in a single chamber, the parliament gave consent for the raising of taxation and played an important role in the administration of justice, foreign policy, war, and all manner of other legislation. Parliamentary business was also carried out by \"sister\" institutions, such as General Councils or Convention of Estates. These could carry out much business also dealt with by parliament – taxation, legislation and policy-making – but lacked the ultimate authority of a full parliament.\n\nThe Parliament of Scotland met for more than four centuries, until it was prorogued \"sine die\" at the time of the Acts of Union in 1707. Thereafter the Parliament of Great Britain operated for both England and Scotland after the creation of the Kingdom of Great Britain on 1 May 1707. When the Parliament of Ireland was abolished in 1801, its former members were merged into what was now called the Parliament of the United Kingdom. From January 1801 until 1927, the British state was officially called the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (even though the Irish Free State had come into existence in December 1922).\n\nThe pre-Union parliament was long portrayed as a constitutionally defective body that acted merely as a rubber stamp for royal decisions, but research during the early 21st century has found that it played an active role in Scottish affairs, and was sometimes a thorn in the side of the Scottish Crown.\n\nThe members were collectively referred to as the Three Estates (), or \"three communities of the realm\" (\"tres communitates\"), until 1690 composed of:\n\nThe bishops and abbots of the First Estate were the thirteen medieval bishops of Aberdeen, Argyll, Brechin, Caithness, Dunblane, Dunkeld, Galloway, Glasgow, Isles (Sodor), Moray, Orkney, Ross and St Andrews and the mitred abbots of Arbroath, Cambuskenneth, Coupar Angus, Dunfermline, Holyrood, Iona, Kelso, Kilwinning, Kinloss, Lindores, Paisley, Melrose, Scone, St Andrews Priory and Sweetheart. After the reformation in 1559, the Scottish abbeys disappeared, although not overnight. Kelso and Lindores were closed quickly, while others, such as Sweetheart, survived well into the 17th century. Next, the bishops themselves were removed from the Church of Scotland, as a result of the Glorious Revolution and the accession of William of Orange. When no members of the First Estate remained, the Second Estate was then split, to retain the division into three.\n\nFrom the 16th century, the \"second estate\" was reorganised by the selection of Shire Commissioners: this has been argued to have created a \"fourth estate\". During the 17th century, after the Union of the Crowns, a \"fifth estate\" of royal office holders (see Lord High Commissioner to the Parliament of Scotland) has also been identified. These latter identifications remain highly controversial among parliamentary historians. Regardless, the term used for the assembled members continued to be \"the Three Estates\".\n\nA \"Shire Commissioner\" was the closest equivalent of the English office of \"Member of Parliament\", namely a commoner or member of the lower nobility. Because the parliament of Scotland was unicameral, all members sat in the same chamber, as opposed to the separate English House of Lords and House of Commons.\n\nThe Scottish parliament evolved during the Middle Ages from the King's Council. It is perhaps first identifiable as a parliament in 1235, described as a \"colloquium\" and already with a political and judicial role. In 1296 we have the first mention of burgh representatives taking part in decision making. By the early 14th century, the attendance of knights and freeholders had become important, and Robert the Bruce began regularly calling burgh commissioners to his Parliament. Consisting of \"The Three Estates\" – of clerics, lay tenants-in-chief and burgh commissioners – sitting in a single chamber, the Scottish parliament acquired significant powers over particular issues. Most obviously it was needed for consent for taxation (although taxation was only raised irregularly in Scotland in the medieval period), but it also had a strong influence over justice, foreign policy, war, and all manner of other legislation, whether political, ecclesiastical, social or economic. Parliamentary business was also carried out by \"sister\" institutions, before c. 1500 by General Council and thereafter by the Convention of Estates. These could carry out much business also dealt with by Parliament – taxation, legislation and policy-making – but lacked the ultimate authority of a full parliament. The Scottish parliament met in a number of different locations throughout its history. In addition to Edinburgh, meetings were held in Perth, Stirling, St Andrews, Dundee, Linlithgow, Dunfermline, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Inverness and Berwick-upon-Tweed.\n\nFrom the early 1450s until 1690, a great deal of the legislative business of the Scottish Parliament was usually carried out by a parliamentary committee known as the \"Lords of the Articles\". This was a committee chosen by the three estates to draft legislation which was then presented to the full assembly to be confirmed. In the past, historians have been particularly critical of this body, claiming that it quickly came to be dominated by royal nominees, thus undermining the power of the full assembly. Recent research suggests that this was far from always being the case. Indeed, in March 1482, the committee was taken over by men shortly to be involved in a coup d'état against the King and his government. On other occasions the committee was so large that it could hardly have been easier to control than the full assembly. More generally, the committee was a pragmatic means to delegate the complicated drafting of acts to those members of parliament skilled in law and letters – not unlike a modern select committee of the UK Parliament – while the right to confirm the act remained with the full assembly of three estates. The Lords of the Articles were abolished in 1690 as part of the revolutionary settlement.\n\nAt various points in its history, the Scottish Parliament was able to exert considerable influence over the Crown. This should not be viewed as a slow rise from parliamentary weakness in 1235 to strength in the 17th century, but rather a situation where in particular decades or sessions between the thirteenth and 17th century, parliament became particularly able to influence the Crown, while at other points that ability was more limited. As early as the reign of David II, parliament was able to prevent him pursuing his policy of a union of the crowns with England, while the 15th-century Stewart monarchs were consistently influenced by a prolonged period of parliamentary strength. Reverses to this situation have been argued to have occurred in the late 16th and early 17th centuries under James VI and Charles I, but in the 17th century, even after the Restoration, parliament was able to remove the clergy's right to attend in 1689 and abolish the Lords of the Articles in 1690, thereby limiting royal power. Parliament's strength was such that the Crown turned to corruption and political management to undermine its autonomy in the latter period. Nonetheless, the period from 1690 to 1707 was one in which political \"parties\" and alliances were formed within parliament in a maturing atmosphere of rigorous debate. The disputes over the English Act of Settlement 1701, the Scottish Act of Security, and the English Alien Act 1705 showed that both sides were prepared to take considered yet considerable risks in their relationships.\n\nBetween 1235 and 1286, little can be told with certainty about Parliament's function, but it appears to have had a judicial and political role which was well established by the end of the century. With the death of Alexander III, Scotland found itself without an adult monarch, and in this situation, Parliament seems to have become more prominent as a means to give added legitimacy to the Council of Guardians who ran the country. By the reign of John Balliol (1292–96), Parliament was well established, and Balliol attempted to use it as a means to withstand the encroachments of his overlord, Edward I of England. With his deposition in 1296, Parliament temporarily became less prominent, but it was again held frequently by King Robert Bruce after 1309. During his reign some of the most important documents made by the King and community of the realm were made in Parliament—for instance the 1309–1310 Declaration of the Clergy.\n\nBy the reign of David II, the \"three estates\" (a phrase that replaced \"community of the realm\" at this time) in Parliament were certainly able to oppose the King when necessary. Most notably, David was repeatedly prevented from accepting an English succession to the throne by Parliament. During the reigns of Robert II and Robert III, Parliament appears to have been held less often, and royal power in that period also declined, but the institution returned to prominence, and arguably enjoyed its greatest period of power over the Crown after the return of James I from English captivity in 1424.\n\nBy the end of the Middle Ages the Parliament had evolved from the King's Council of Bishops and Earls into a \"colloquium\" with a political and judicial role. The attendance of knights and freeholders had become important, and burgh commissioners joined them to form the Three Estates. It acquired significant powers over particular issues, including consent for taxation, but it also had a strong influence over justice, foreign policy, war, and other legislation, whether political, ecclesiastical, social or economic. Much of the legislative business of the Scottish parliament was carried out by a parliamentary committee known as the Lords of the Articles, chosen by the three estates to draft legislation which was then presented to the full assembly to be confirmed.\n\nAfter 1424, Parliament was often willing to defy the King – it was far from being simply a \"rubber stamp\" of royal decisions. During the 15th century, Parliament was called far more often than, for instance, the English Parliament – on average over once a year – a fact that both reflected and augmented its influence. It repeatedly opposed James I's (1424–1437) requests for taxation to pay an English ransom in the 1420s and was openly hostile to James III (1460–1488) in the 1470s and early 1480s. In 1431, Parliament granted a tax to James I for a campaign in the Highlands on the condition that it be kept in a locked chest under the keepership of figures deeply out of favour with the King. In 1436, there was even an attempt made to arrest the King \"in the name of the three estates\". Between October 1479 and March 1482, Parliament was conclusively out of the control of James III. It refused to forfeit his brother, the Duke of Albany, despite a royal siege of the Duke's castle, tried to prevent the King leading his army against the English (a powerful indication of the estates' lack of faith in their monarch), and appointed men to the Lords of the Articles and important offices who were shortly to remove the King from power. James IV (1488–1513) realised that Parliament could often create more problems than it solved, and avoided meetings after 1509. This was a trend seen in other European nations as monarchical power grew stronger – for instance England under Henry VII, as well as France and Spain.\n\nLike many continental assemblies the Scottish Parliament was being called less frequently by the early sixteenth century and might have been dispensed with by the crown had it not been for the series of minorities and regencies that dominated from 1513. The crown was also able to call a Convention of Estates, which was quicker to assemble and could issue laws like parliament, making them invaluable in a crisis, but they could only deal with a specific issue and were more resistant to the giving of taxation rights to the crown.\n\nParliament played a major part in the Reformation crisis of the mid-sixteenth century. It had been used by James V to uphold Catholic orthodoxy and asserted its right to determine the nature of religion in the country, disregarding royal authority in 1560. The 1560 parliament included 100 lairds, who were predominantly Protestant, and who claimed a right to sit in the Parliament under the provision of a failed shire election act of 1428. Their position in the parliament remained uncertain and their presence fluctuated until the 1428 act was revived in 1587 and provision made for the annual election of two commissioners from each shire (except Kinross and Clackmannan, which had one each). The property qualification for voters was for freeholders who held land from the crown of the value of 40s of auld extent. This excluded the growing class of feuars, who would not gain these rights until 1661. The clerical estate was marginalised in Parliament by the Reformation, with the laymen who had acquired the monasteries sitting as \"abbots\" and \"priors\". Catholic clergy were excluded after 1567, but a small number of Protestant bishops continued as the clerical estate. James VI attempted to revive the role of the bishops from about 1600. A further group appeared in the Parliament from the minority of James VI in the 1560s, with members of the Privy Council representing the king's interests, until they were excluded in 1641. James VI continued to manage parliament through the Lords of the Articles, who deliberated legislation before it reached the full parliament. He controlled the committee by filling it with royal officers as non-elected members, but was forced to limit this to eight from 1617.\n\nIn the second half of the sixteenth century, Parliament began to legislate on more and more matters and there was a marked increase in the amount of legislation it produced. During the reign of James VI, the Lords of the Articles came more under the influence of the crown. By 1612, they sometimes seem to have been appointed by the Crown rather than Parliament, and as a result the independence of parliament was perceived by contemporaries to have been eroded.\n\nDuring the 16th century, the composition of Parliament underwent a number of significant changes and it found itself sharing the stage with new national bodies. The emergence of the Convention of Royal Burghs as the \"parliament\" of Scotland's trading towns and the development of the Kirk's General Assembly after the Reformation (1560) meant that rival representative assemblies could bring pressure to bear on parliament in specific areas.\n\nFollowing the Reformation, laymen acquired the monasteries and those sitting as \"abbots\" and \"priors\" were now, effectively, part of the estate of nobles. The bishops continued to sit in Parliament regardless of whether they conformed to Protestantism or not. This resulted in pressure from the Kirk to reform ecclesiastical representation in Parliament. Catholic clergy were excluded after 1567 but Protestant bishops continued as the clerical estate until their abolition in 1638 when Parliament became an entirely lay assembly. An act of 1587 granted the lairds of each shire the right to send two commissioners to every parliament. These shire commissioners attended from 1592 onwards, although they shared one vote until 1638 when they secured a vote each. The number of burghs with the right to send commissioners to parliament increased quite markedly in the late 16th and early 17th centuries until, in the 1640s, they often constituted the largest single estate in Parliament.\n\nThe first printed edition of the legislation of the Parliament, \"The New Actis and Constitutionis\", was published in Edinburgh in 1542 by the printer Thomas Davidson under commission from James V.\n\nIn 1639, the legislature was installed in the newly-built Parliament Hall, where it remained until dissolution in 1707. Victory the same year in the early stages of the 1639–1652 War of the Three Kingdoms brought the Covenanters to power, with bishops being expelled from both kirk and Parliament. Control of the executive was taken from the Crown, many of the constitutional changes being copied by the English Parliament. \n\nHowever, the Scots were increasingly concerned at their loss of political and economic power since 1603. In an effort to mitigate this, during the 1642–1645 First English Civil War, the Covenanters agreed the 1643 Solemn League and Covenant. One outcome was the creation of the Committee of Both Kingdoms, a union of English and Scottish parliamentary leaders; opposed by English Royalists and Oliver Cromwell, it was suspended in 1645. In 1647, the Scots agreed to restore Charles to the English throne; their failure in the 1648–1649 Second English Civil War led to his trial and execution by the English Rump Parliament and officers of the New Model Army. \n\nFollowing the execution the Scots accepted Charles II as king in 1649 but their attempt to put him on the English throne was defeated in the 1649–1651 Anglo-Scots War. As a result, Scotland was incorporated into the Protectorate (see Cromwell's Act of Grace and Tender of Union) and a brief Anglo-Scottish parliamentary union (1653–1659). \n\nAn independent Parliament was restored in 1661, sometimes known as the \"Drunken Parliament\". The term was coined by John Welsh and he was put in trial for it. The restored body passed the 1661 Rescissory Act, which effectively annulled all Parliamentary legislation since 1633. It generally supported Charles and initially did the same when James succeeded in 1685; when it refused to pass his measures, James suspended it and resorted to rule by decree.\n\nThe deposition of James in 1689 ended a century of political dispute by confirming the primacy of Parliament over the Crown. The \"Claim of Right\" which offered the crown to Mary and her husband William, placed important limitations on royal power, including the abolition of the Lords of the Articles. It has been argued that unlike its English counterpart, the Scottish parliament never became a true centre of national identity. The 1707 Acts of Union created a combined Parliament of Great Britain, which sat in Westminster and largely continued English traditions without interruption.\n\nRobert Burns famously claimed Union was brought about by Scots \"bought and sold for English gold\" and bribery certainly played a prominent role. However, it was also driven by the same trends the Scots attempted to manage in the 1640s, worsened by the events of the 1690s; this was a time of economic hardship and famine in many parts of Europe, known in Scotland as the Seven ill years. Combined with the failure of the Darién scheme in 1698, it allowed Anne to achieve her great-grandfather's ambition of a unitary state. Parliament was dissolved, 45 Scots being added to the 513 members of the House of Commons and 16 to the 190 members of the House of Lords.\n\nThe office of the presiding officer in parliament never developed into a post similar in nature to that of the Speaker of the House of Commons at Westminster—mainly because of parliament's unicameral nature, which made it more like the English House of Lords. An act of 1428 which created a \"common speaker\" proved abortive, and the chancellor remained the presiding officer (until recently the Lord Chancellor of Great Britain did similarly preside over the House of Lords). In the absence of the King after the Union of the Crowns in 1603, parliament was presided over by the Lord Chancellor or the Lord High Commissioner. After the Restoration, the Lord Chancellor was made \"ex-officio\" president of the parliament (now reflected in the Scottish Parliament by the election of a presiding officer), his functions including the formulation of questions and putting them to the vote.\n\n\n\n"}

In his 1972 paper, \"Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems\", Richard Karp used Stephen Cook's 1971 theorem that the boolean satisfiability problem is NP-complete (also called the Cook-Levin theorem) to show that there is a polynomial time many-one reduction from the boolean satisfiability problem to each of 21 combinatorial and graph theoretical computational problems, thereby showing that they are all NP-complete. This was one of the first demonstrations that many natural computational problems occurring throughout computer science are computationally intractable, and it drove interest in the study of NP-completeness and the P versus NP problem.\n\nKarp's 21 problems are shown below, many with their original names. The nesting indicates the direction of the reductions used. For example, Knapsack was shown to be NP-complete by reducing Exact cover to Knapsack.\n\n\nAs time went on it was discovered that many of the problems can be solved efficiently if restricted to special cases, or can be solved within any fixed percentage of the optimal result. However, David Zuckerman showed in 1996 that every one of these 21 problems has a constrained optimization version that is impossible to approximate within any constant factor unless P = NP, by showing that Karp's approach to reduction generalizes to a specific type of approximability reduction. Note however that these may be different from the standard optimization versions of the problems, which may have approximation algorithms (as in the case of maximum cut).\n\n\n"}

By May 2013, he was under investigation for allegedly faking his death to avoid charges of grand larceny, and a warrant was issued in Mississippi for his arrest. However, on September 15, 2014, it was finally confirmed by NBC News that Tim Dog had indeed died on February 14, 2013, as had been initially reported, but then disputed. A death certificate was filed in Dekalb County, Georgia, putting an end to speculation that he was still alive and trying to avoid his court-mandated debts.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, seminal rap group N.W.A and several other West Coast rap artists were becoming popular within the hip hop community and magazines such as \"Word Up\" and \"The Source\" provided significant coverage to artists from Los Angeles. The success of N.W.A and their focus on the South Central L.A. suburb of Compton via their platinum album \"Straight Outta Compton\" had spawned a number of imitators and other groups who also claimed to represent the suburb. The success of artists such as Compton's Most Wanted and DJ Quik led to a period in hip hop where so-called \"gangsta rap\" and its trademark dress of black Los Angeles Raiders and Los Angeles Kings gear were \"de rigueur.\"\n\nSome New York hip hop artists resented the exposure and success of their West Coast counterparts, an animosity which Tim Dog would tap into via the release of his groundbreaking first single. Frustrated at the apparent lack of interest in East Coast artists from record companies, Tim recorded \"Fuck Compton\", a scathing diss track from his debut album \"Penicillin on Wax\". \"Fuck Compton\" attacked the city's style of dress and musical output and made threatening gestures to several Compton rappers including Eazy-E, MC Ren, Ice Cube, Dr. Dre and Michel'le. Tim Dog would later exclude Ice Cube on \"Step To Me\", another diss track attacking N.W.A.\n\nThe lyrics also made reference to an infamous incident involving N.W.A's Dr. Dre and \"Pump It Up\" host Dee Barnes. Barnes had accused Dre (real name Andre Young) of assaulting her after \"Pump It Up\" had edited an N.W.A interview to include disparaging comments made by Ice Cube, who was embroiled in a feud with his former group at the time. The single was released by Ruffhouse Records, home to other artists such as Cypress Hill and Kris Kross, and became a worldwide underground hit in the clubs and hip hop circles. Two versions of a music video were released — the original version and a censored edition.\n\n\"Penicillin on Wax\" included several additional \"disses\" aimed at both Compton artists and commercially successful artists such as Kid 'n Play and Kwamé. The intro used the same beat as N.W.A's \"Efil4zaggin\" album intro. Tim taunted, \"I stole your beat and made it better, to show the whole world that you ain't nothing but a bunch of pussies,\" before a number of disparaging answering machine messages supported Tim's position as he rapped, \"Wearing all that black, driving them cars, but you still look wack!\" In another skit, \"DJ Quik Beat Down,\" Tim Dog \"physically assaulted\" DJ Quik. Since the release, incoming responses came the following years from west coast artists Snoop Dogg, DJ Quik, Compton's Most Wanted, Penthouse Players Clique, Rodney O & Joe Cooley and Tweedy Bird Loc.\n\nTim followed up with his second album \"Do Or Die\" in 1993. The album represented Tim's shift of focus away from confrontation with the West Coast and instead concentrated on hardcore East Coast rap. The album contained a shout-out to Tupac Shakur whom Tim thanked for assisting him when involved in a potentially violent situation when touring in California.\n\nIn 1994, Tim Dog released the EP \"Bitch with a perm\". The second track, \"Dog Baby\", was another diss to Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg.\n\nTim moved to the UK in 1995 and worked with U.K. artist Apache Indian, producing the hit single \"Make Way for the Indian\". Tim then toured with Kool Keith and recorded several other tracks, including his August 2005 collaboration with Percee P, \"NY to the UK.\"\n\nTim Dog had been the head of \"Rap Legends Recordings\" and previously co-founded Our Turn Records in Los Angeles with Eddie Pugh, President of Black Music Sony Records. Previously, he was the CEO President of Big Xity Entertainment based in New York and BMC Management based in Atlanta.\n\nIn 2011, Tim Dog pleaded guilty to grand larceny for conning a woman, Esther Pilgrim, out of $32,000 in an online dating scam. He was sentenced to five years probation and ordered to pay restitution of $19,000 to Pilgrim. The case was featured on the June 15, 2012, episode of \"Dateline NBC\", which clarified that it was a best interest plea (Alford plea) to theft.\n\nTim Dog reportedly died of complications from diabetes in February 14, 2013. However the funeral was canceled and no death certificate or autopsy existed. His family also stayed away from the media claiming religious reasons as a justification for their shunning of the press and wanting to mourn in private. After Pilgrim alleged in May 2013 that Tim Dog's \"reported death\" may have been a scheme by Tim Dog to avoid payments to her, she came public demanding further investigation about his death. A warrant was issued in Mississippi for his arrest in case he was still alive.\n\nOn September 15, 2014, it was finally confirmed by NBC News that Tim Dog had indeed died on February 14, 2013, as had been initially reported, but then disputed.

He scored his league with a goal 25 May 2005, 1–2 lose over Al-Ahli.\n\nNikbakht was instrumental in helping Esteghlal grab the 2005–06 league championship with an electrifying display in the win over Bargh Shiraz. The win resulted in Esteghlal (59 points) edging Pas (58 points) for the IPL championship.\n\nIn June 2006 he signed a two-year contract with Esteghlal's fierce rival, Persepolis which caused him to lose his popularity among Esteghlal fans. He played in the final of the Hazfi Cup for Persepolis and scored in first match but missed a penalty in the second leg. In the 2006–07 season in Persepolis, Nikbakht played as a forward, which made him score 8 goals in 25 appearances and have 8 assists in the league. In his second season for Persepolis, he won the league and had his best season of his career with 9 goals and 7 assists.\n\nIn January 2008, Nikbakht was invited to go on a trial with Sheffield United. He was the most influential player after Ali Karimi for Persepolis in 2008–09 season.\n\nHe signed for Tractor Sazi in summer 2009 but for disciplinary reason he was not able to play for the first half of the season and his contract was canceled.\n\nFor the second half of the season 2009–10 he joined Steel Azin.\n\nHe moved to Saba in 2010 and played in the first half of the season but for unknown reasons he did not continue with the team and there were rumours that again there has been disciplinary actions against him which prevented him to play in the top level.\n\nThen he moved to Paykan in Azadegan League which he got promoted to the league for the season after with the team.\n\nIn July 2012, he signed a one-year contract with Gahar but he was still banned to play in Iran Pro League due disciplinary actions.\n\nhe terminated his contract with Gahar Zagros and joins Damash Gilan.\n\nOn 1 July 2013, Nikbakht returned to Esteghlal after seven years, after signing a one-year contract.\n\nOn 22 December 2014, Nikbakht signed a three-and-a-half-month loan deal with promotion-battling Iran Football's 2nd Division club FC Khoneh Be Khoneh until the end of the season. On 16 January, Nikbakht came on as a substitute in the 53rd minute and scored goal the match winner against Sepidrood.\n\nHe made his first appearance for Iran in a World Cup qualifying game against Guam in Tabriz in December 2000. He scored on his debut.\n\nNikbakht's performance in the national squad was instrumental in Iran's progress to the next WC qualifying round. However, his disciplinary problems has created difficulties for the national team coaches and he is often viewed as a primadonna. Nonetheless, his darting runs on the flanks and his pace continues to be a great asset for his team, and most fans will not forget his winning goal in a crucial World Cup 2006 qualifier against Jordan.\nHe won the 2002 Asian Games and 2004 West Asian Football Federation Championship with Team Melli.\n\nThere had been rampant speculation that an in form Nikbaht would definitely make Branko Ivankovic's final 23 men list for the 2006 World Cup in Germany. Branko Ivankovic had himself alluded to this by stating that \"I love Nikbaht\" in an interview, but that his hitherto out-of-form play was the major impediment for him reclaiming his spot in \"Team Melli\". Many had tagged him as the saviour for Iran's left-back defensive complications as he is naturally left-footed, good physique, quick with his feet, a goal-getter and a workhorse. Unfortunately for him, an old injury caused him to be crossed off the main squad heading to Germany, and he was instead placed on the reserves list.\n\nAnother injury forced him be disqualified from Iran's squad for the 2007 Asian Cup, but he is back to join Team Melli in the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign.\n\nAfter a heated dispute with Federation official disciplinary board, Nikbakht was axed from playing for national team for the rest of his career. This marks the second time the player has been penalised for behaviour problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

According to a subscription on folio 239 verso, the manuscript was written by a monk named Lupus for one Ato, who was probably Ato, abbot the monastery St. Vincent on the Volturno, near Benevento. Ato was abbot from 736-760. \n\nThe codex contains the Vulgate version of the four Gospels, the canon tables of Eusebius of Caesarea, the letter of St. Jerome to Pope Damasus (\"Novum opus\"), the prologue of St. Jerome to the Gospels (\"Plures fuisse\"), and prologues and chapter lists for each of the Gospels. The text is written on vellum in two columns in Uncial script with no division between words. The running titles are in small uncials while the incipits and explicits are in capitals. The incipits and explicits are written in alternating lines of red and black ink. The subscription of Lupus is written in uncials, and also has alternating lines of red and black ink. The text contains additional punctuation and annotations in a 10th-century Beneventuan hand.\n\nThere are 240 folios of 355 by 275 mm. The folios are generally gathered into quires of eight folios each. There are a few gatherings of ten folios and a few gatherings are lacking one or more folios. The rear flyleaf (folio 240) is a piece of vellum from another manuscript and contains a fragment of a commentary on the Epistle to the Romans written in a 9th-century Carolingian minuscule that has 10th century Beneventan punctuation.\n\nThe manuscript has decorated canon tables, initials, and incipits and explicits. The canon tables are underneath arches decorated with gold, red and blue. Both sides of folio 4 have decorated arches, but are otherwise blank. Each of the Gospels begins with an initial which is decorated in green, red, and gold. The incipits and explicits are decorated with green red and black ivy leaves.\n\nThe manuscript was owned in the 8th century by the monastery of St. Vincent on the Voturno, and may have been produced there. By the 13th century it was associated with St. Peter's convent in Benevento. In the first half of the 18th century it was owned by Dr. Richard Mead, and was used by Dr. Richard Bentley in his collation of New Testament texts. Dr. Mead may have acquired the manuscript in the 1690s when he traveled to Italy, however, the manuscript did not appear in the catalog of the sale of his library in 1754-55. The manuscript was later owned by Anthony Askew (d. 1754). It was purchased by John Jackson in 1785 at the sale of Askew's manuscripts. The British Library purchased it in 1794 at the sale of Jackson's manuscripts.\n\n"}

Das EFX caught the attention of EPMD at a local talent show where, despite losing the competition, they did well enough to convince EPMD to sign them to a recording contract. The duo gained critical and commercial fame with the release of their landmark debut album \"Dead Serious\", which highlighted their unusual rapping style (which they nicknamed \"sewage\").\n\n\"Dead Serious\" went platinum and its lead single, \"They Want EFX,\" (which contains samples from James Brown's \"Blind Man Can See It\" and Malcolm McLaren's \"Buffalo Gals\") reached the top ten on the U.S. \"Billboard\" R&B chart, the Top 40 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and No. 1 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart. Follow-up singles \"Mic Checka\" and \"Straight Out the Sewer\" did not chart on the Hot 100, but reached No. 1 and No. 3 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart, respectively.\n\nThe duo also made a guest appearance on the remix of Ice Cube's smash hit single \"Check Yo Self\". The song reached No. 20 on the Hot 100 and No. 1 on the Rap Tracks chart. The track peaked at #36 on the UK Singles Chart in August 1993 and sold over one million copies in the U.S.\n\nAs their career progressed, Das EFX's once-distinctive and unique lyrical delivery was imitated by several other artists and became more commonplace. Derailed by the popularity of their own style, the duo slowed down their fast-paced flow, eliminated the \"iggedy\" suffix and downplayed their cartoonish content on their second album, \"Straight Up Sewaside\".\n\nAround the time of their third album \"Hold It Down\" (which was far less commercially successful than their debut release), Das EFX found themselves caught in the middle of EPMD's ugly breakup. They ended up siding with PMD (Parrish Smith), and it led to a three-year absence from recording. They returned in 1998 with the album \"Generation EFX\" and followed up in 2003 with the album \"How We Do\"; both were panned by critics.\n\nAfter a hiatus, the group went on an international tour with DJ Rondevu in 2006. In 2007, the duo appeared on the remix of Nas' \"Where are They Now\" and continued to tour the globe on a regular basis. They toured again in 2010, and continue to record and perform today to a smaller, yet devoted cult following.\n\nFrom the time of their debut in 1992 to 1993, several elements of their style were adopted by other hip-hop artists, including Lords of the Underground, Fu-Schnickens, Kris Kross, Common and even, to a lesser extent, Public Enemy. The 1996 BLACKstreet song \"No Diggity\", with \"diggity\" meaning \"doubt\", bears a title phonetically identical to the track \"No Diggedy\" on DAS EFX's 1995 release \"Hold It Down\". This also became a popular catchphrase at the time. Jay-Z's early style is described by \"Vibe\" as \"a distinctly Das EFX-type, stiggety style\" on his 12\" single \"Can't Get With That\", although Jay-Z actually predated Das EFX with this style on the song \"The Originator\", alongside old school rapper Jaz-O in 1989. Some hip-hop pundits maintain that Das EFX exploited the tongue twisting style as a gimmick, and that they are erroneously credited with originating a style that was established years before their debut.\n\nTheir refrain of \"Chiggedy-check yo self before you wriggedy-wreck yo self\" from their feature on Ice Cube's hit single \"Check Yo Self\" became a catchphrase in 1993. The song appeared in the videogame \"\", playing on the radio station Radio Los Santos.\n\nIn an episode of \"Beverly Hills, 90210\", David Silver (played by Brian Austin Green) can be seen reciting the lyrics to \"They Want EFX.\"\n\nComedian Dave Chappelle has made numerous references to DAS EFX's unique style and lyrics in sketches of his popular \"Chappelle's Show\". In one sketch, a teenage Chappelle tells his girlfriend \"I riggity-realize that I liggity-love you.\" In another, Chappelle as President Bush announced that a country named \"Riggity-Row\" will join the Coalition of the willing. In yet another sketch, Chappelle as a news presenter announces the opening lyrics of \"They Want EFX\" as a special report.\n\n\n"}

Throughout their history, the Northern Knights played their home games at West Anchorage High School Gymnasium.\n\nWhen the Northern Knights joined the league, then known as the Eastern Basketball Association (EBA), it attracted national attention for being perhaps the most misplaced franchise in the history of professional sports. Playing in Anchorage, Alaska, the team was 5,000 miles away from its nearest competitor, as all the other teams were based in the eastern Pennsylvania–New York–New Jersey area. League officials \"began to see the publicity value a team in Alaska would have for the EBA, which, with an enlarged talent pool since the ABA folded, had been trying to upgrade its image from that of a nickel-and-dime Pennsylvania mill-town circuit—which is mostly what it had been—to something on the order of baseball's Triple-A leagues,\" John Papnek in \"Sports Illustrated\".\n\nDuring the team's first two seasons, the Knights began their regular schedule with an extended homestand; then endured a mid-season bus trip to every CBA team in the league; then finished out the season with another homestand.

When Berlusconi entered politics in December 1993, however, Montanelli left fearing for his own independence, and went on to found the short-lived daily newspaper \"La Voce\".\n\nIn 1992, Berlusconi left the role of the owner of \"il Giornale\" to his brother Paolo. Vittorio Feltri replaced Indro Montanelli as editor. , the publisher of the newspaper, Società Europea di Edizioni, was owned by Paolo (58.3%) and Mondadori Editori (41.7% directly and indirectly). The paper was published in broadsheet format until May 2005 when it switched to tabloid format. In May 2005 \"il Giornale\" started its online version. In 2007 the monthly business magazine \"Espansione\" became a supplement of the paper. As of 2016, Società Europea di Edizioni was still partially owned by Arnoldo Mondadori Editore directly for 36.90%, which is a listed company that majority owned by Fininvest. It was reported that Roberto Amodei, the owner of several sports newspaper of Italy, had interested to subscribe the capital increase of Società Europea di Edizioni.\n\n\"il Giornale\" was the seventh best-selling Italian newspaper in 1997 with a circulation of 218,741 copies.

The origin of the word 'deva' comes from the Sanskrit language. According to Theosophist Charles Webster Leadbeater devas represent a separate evolution to that of humanity. The concept of devas as nature-spirits was further developed in the writings of Theosophist Geoffrey Hodson. It is believed that there are numerous different types of devas with a population in the millions performing different functions on Earth to help the ecology function better. It is asserted they can be observed by those whose third eyes have been activated.\n\nIn addition, it is believed by Theosophists that there are millions of devas living inside the Sun, the indwelling solar deity of which Theosophists call the \"Solar Logos\"—these devas are called \"solar angels\", or sometimes \"solar devas\" or \"solar spirits\". Sometimes, it is believed, they visit Earth and can be observed, like other devas, by humans whose third eyes have been activated. Theosophists believe that there are also devas living inside all the other stars besides Sol; these are called \"stellar angels\".\n\nIn the Findhorn material, the term refers to archetypal spiritual intelligences behind species, in other words the group soul of a species.\n\nSome New Age sources use the term as a generic term to designate any being regarded as being composed of etheric matter--elementals, nature spirits (including the various types of nature spirits such as fairies, ondines, etc.). The pre-New Age etymology of the term is described in the article Deva (Hinduism).\n\n\n"}

Nicknamed \"The Candy Man\", he played in the MLB during the years 1975–1993 for eight teams, the Pittsburgh Pirates, California Angels, New York Mets, New York Yankees, Montreal Expos, Minnesota Twins, Toronto Blue Jays, and the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nCandelaria was born on November 6, 1953 to Puerto Rican parents. He is the second of four children born to John and Felicia Candelaria. He grew up in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, New York. He frequently attended New York Yankees' games at Yankee Stadium.\n\nAt the age of 15, Candelaria attended a baseball tryout where a Los Angeles Dodgers scout called him the best he had ever seen. The tryout catcher had to be replaced with a major league catcher for fear of injuring the stand-in.\n\nCandelaria played as a center in the Baloncesto Superior Nacional (BSN), the top tier basketball league in the Puerto Rico, for 2 seasons with the Piratas de Quebradillas in 1971 and 1972. When he announced he was leaving the Quebradillas basketball \"Pirates\" for the Pittsburgh Pirates, many were skeptical. The local newspaper featured him pitching a basketball on the front page of the sports section. He had attended La Salle Academy in lower Manhattan and gained fame as a basketball center, including leading his team to a championship in 1971.\n\nCandelaria had his best season in 1977, when he was 20–5 with a 2.34 ERA in 230⅔ innings pitched. He was also a member of the 1979 World Series champion Pirates team. On August 9, 1976, Candelaria no-hit the Los Angeles Dodgers 2–0 at Three Rivers Stadium; it was the first no-hitter pitched by a Pirate in Pittsburgh since Nick Maddox at Exposition Park in 1907. Candelaria's second post-season appearance with the Pirates (he pitched Game 3 in the 1975 NLCS) came in their 1979 World Series championship season. Candelaria started Game 1 of the 1979 NLCS and pitched seven innings of two-run ball against the Reds with a painful shoulder. The Pirates won 5–2 in 11 innings. In the 1979 World Series, Candelaria had a rough Game 3, giving up five runs in 4 innings as the Pirates lost 8–4 to the Orioles. He redeemed himself in a crucial Game 6 by combining with Kent Tekulve to pitch a 4–0 shutout.\n\nCandelaria, who stood and wielded a mid- to upper-90s fastball with natural movement, remained an effective starter for the Pirates through the 1984 season. He suffered personal tragedy on Christmas morning 1984, when his 18-month-old son John Jr. fell into the family's swimming pool at their home in Sarasota, Florida. John Jr. spent five weeks in intensive care and was then transitioned to home, where he received nursing care 24 hours per day. He was readmitted to the hospital multiple times. John Jr. died in a Pittsburgh hospital in November 1985.\n\nCandelaria was moved to the bullpen in 1985. In response to the change, Candelaria called general manager Harding Peterson \"a bozo\"; he said that the team's ownership valued its racehorses more than its baseball players. He posted nine saves out of the Pittsburgh bullpen, which ended up being a team high on a 57-win team. In early August, the team traded Candelaria to the California Angels. At the time, he was one of only two Pirates that remained from the 1979 championship team, the other being Don Robinson. The Angels immediately made him a starter again and he went 7–3 down the stretch in 1985 and helped the Angels into the 1986 ALCS with a 10–2 record. Candelaria later said that the trade to a contending team had been a positive change for him.\n\nCandelaria played for both New York teams (Mets and Yankees), both Los Angeles teams (Dodgers and Angels) and both Canadian teams (Blue Jays and Expos). He finished his career back where it started in Pittsburgh in 1993, making him the only Pirates player from the 1979 team to play for the Pirates during their twenty consecutive losing seasons.\n\nCandelaria currently lives in North Carolina, and is an avid world traveler. John has a nephew, Zac Candelaria, who played catcher at the Division One program of Fairfield University.\n\n\n"}

He usually played as a striker. He is currently the head of technical committee of Esteghlal.\n\nRowshan was 13 when he joined Taj youth team. He initially faced many problems, such as his house being far from the Taj training ground in Nazi Abad. His father used to accompany him to the Taj football and training grounds. His father would either wait for Hassan to finish training, carefully watching his moves or given half a chance would joined in a senior matches when the eldest fancied a game of football. During their long trip back home, Hassan's father would always talk football to him, never tiring from the subject and always willing to advise and offer tips on how to improve his game and skills.\n\nRowshan's first success came at the school's football championship. While in the sixth grade at Pasargad Shemiran school, he was a member of the school football team. He experienced the sweet taste of championship at that early age, and thought of future championship and grand occasions. Although the championship was sweet at school level, Rowshan did not seriously consider playing this level of football anything other than a pastime and filling the gap.\n\nHis first taste of real football came when a visiting Brazilian youth team was in town for a friendly match. 20 thousand spectators were at Amjadieh Stadium eager to observe and enjoy some Brazilian magic. Somehow the trainer decided to give young Rowshan an opportunity to play the last 20 minutes. This was by all means a very difficult experience for a youngster who never played in front of more than a dozen people. His fear of the crowd and the immense pressure he felt, could not be overcome and the team lost the match, 2–1.\n\nLike many Iranians of his generation, Hassan was born in a family of football fans. His father bought him his own plastic ball, so that he would not bother them while playing football. Hassan played in the neighborhood, and during one of the matches with SaadAbad team, he was approached by Homayoun Behzadi, a national team forward of that time, who whispered to him \"You are a complete player\".\n\nLater, Behzadi recruited Rowshan for Sharq, a team playing in the third division of Tehran league. His contribution to this team was not too successful and the team failed to gain promotion to the second division and subsequently it was disbanded. Since little Rowshan tasted competitive football, he was determined to join a club in the league rather than going back to street football. In 1969 Rowshan joined Taj club (known today as Esteghlal Tehran), one of the two big clubs of Iran.\n\nRowshan was quickly becoming a household name in Iran. With his club, Taj Tehran, he won many championship and trophies. He first broke into the Taj side when he was 17 years old and played his first season in Takht Jamshid Cup. He won the Iranian league in 1975 and reached the second place in 1974. Further he won the Hazfi Cup in 1977.\n\nAfter the World Cup 1978, although Hasan Rowshan had limited playing time in Argentina, the scouts from several countries discovered his potential and send representations to his club in order to recruit him. Rowshan settled for UAE and in particular Al-Ahli club of Dubai. Jointly with his national teammate, Hassan Nazari, they won the championship for Al Ahli in 1980. From 1982 to 1983 he joined Esteghlal F.C. again for a few games.\n\nIn 1984, Roshan rejoined Esteghlal F.C. again, where he could win the Tehran Province League in 1985.\n\nHowever, the highlights of his career were winning the football tournament of the Asian Games in Tehran in 1974 and Asian Cup 1976 in Tehran as well as reaching the quarterfinals of the Summer Olympics in Montreal in 1976 and winning the qualification for the World Cup finals in Argentina 1978. During the Asian qualification games, Rowshan excelled. His goals and assists was a major contribution to the success of the team and eventual qualification. This success did not come easy, as his constant runs and skills in maneuvering and dribbling made him a target for some rough tackles, he missed some games due to a serious and long lasting knee injury.\n\nHis injury after the qualification games were a major problem for coach Heshmat Mohajerani. When Iran played its first game, Rowshan was doubtful. However, he didn't even play one single full game and scored the only goal for Iran in a 4-1 loss to Peru. After the World Cup 1978, many critics in Iran indicated that if Iran had a fully fit Rowshan, the results would have been much better than what was achieved.\n\nHe was appointed as the Technical Manager for Iran national under-20 football team in 2005, however he resigned later.\n\nWhen he returned to Iran in the 90s, he formed a top quality football school for kids which was a huge success. Hassan Rowshan Football School was the first academic football school in Middle East.\n\nHassan Rowshan became the head of Esteghlal's Football Academy on 6 August 2007. It's understood that he offered a new Football development system based on Aston Villa's academy, but head of Iran's Sports organization Mr.Ali Abadi & Fatholahzadeh refused to provide the required budget (150K USD per year). Iranian press revealed that Hassan Rowshan tried to fight the powerful insider relationships of the club but he resigned later in 2008. Alireza Mansourian took over the Academy. On 15 July 2011, he was appointed as head of technical committee of Esteghlal by Ali Fathollahzadeh succeeding Nasser Hejazi.\n\nRowshan was sued for libel and found guilty, with a sentence of a fine and lashes.\n"}

His Floronic Man appearance first appeared in the Green Lantern backup in \"Flash\" #245. His Seeder appearance first appeared in \"Swamp Thing #21\". He became known as \"Floro,\" and a superhero, in \"The New Guardians\".\n\nJason Woodrue first appears in \"The Atom\" #1 (June–July 1962). Woodrue is an exile from an interdimensional world (Floria) inhabited by dryads. Woodrue, sometimes called the Plant Master, uses his advanced botanical knowledge to control plant growth in an attempt to take over the world. He is defeated by the superhero Atom.The Plant Master returns to face the Atom and the Justice League.\n\nIn \"Flash\" #245 (November 1976), Woodrue uses an experimental formula to transform his body into a plant/human hybrid, with his skin resembling bark and his hair turning into leaves. Now calling himself the Floronic Man, he is defeated by Green Lantern. After a rematch with the Atom and Wonder Woman, the Floronic Man later becomes a member of the Secret Society of Super-Villains.\n\nIn Alan Moore's relaunch of the Swamp Thing in \"The Saga of the Swamp Thing\" (vol. 2) #21 (February 1984), Woodrue is hired by General Avery Sunderland to discover how scientist Alec Holland had been turned into the Swamp Thing. Woodrue discovers that the creature, instead of being a mutated version of Holland, is rather an intelligent mass of plant life that had fed on Holland's dead body and absorbed his knowledge and memories. The Floronic Man tries to warn Sunderland that the Swamp Thing is not dead, but the General refuses to listen and announces his intent to terminate Woodrue's employment. Subsequently, the Floronic Man traps Sunderland in his office with a thawed and enraged Swamp Thing, who kills the General.\n\nIn \"The Saga of the Swamp Thing\" (vol. 2) #22 (March 1984), the Floronic Man uses the Swamp Thing's body—now regressing to a plant-like state due to his inability to accept the new revelation about his origins, Woodrue literally eating parts of him—to contact the Green, which is composed of the life force of all plants on Earth. The experience drives the Floronic Man insane; he refers to himself as \"Wood-Rue\", and sets out to destroy all non-plant life on Earth by forcing the plants to produce an excess amount of oxygen to force humans and animals into extinction, in the belief that he is \"saving\" Earth from mankind. Woodrue is confronted by a revived Swamp Thing, who reveals to the Green that plants cannot survive without humans and animals, as his actions would deprive them of the carbon dioxide that \"they\" require to breathe that comes from humans and animals, forcing Woodrue to acknowledge that his actions are the actions of a man rather than a plant. The Green abandons the Floronic Man, who is then taken into custody by the Justice League after undergoing a complete mental breakdown.\n\nThe 1988 Neil Gaiman/Dave McKean miniseries \"Black Orchid\" recasts Dr. Jason Woodrue as a University professor who taught botany to Philip Sylvian, Alec and Linda Holland, and Pamela Isley. The character Philip Sylvian, apparently unaware of Woodrue's transformation, refers to him as a \"poor old guy\" and states: \"Last I heard he was in Arkham \"Insane\" Asylum...\"\n\nThe Floronic Man was briefly a hero after the events of \"Millennium\" led to him to become a member of the New Guardians. In this new role, Woodrue takes on the name Floro. After the death of most of his teammates, he reverts to his original status as a villain.\nThe Floronic Man returns in \"Batman: Shadow of the Bat\" #56 (November 1996). After breaking Poison Ivy out of Arkham with his two underlings Holly and Eva, the Floronic Man explains his past to the Batman and Poison Ivy, telling the story of how he prevented a plot of the Swamp Thing's, only to get decapitated. After scientists manage to keep his head alive, the first thing he comes in contact with is marijuana. Regenerating a plant body, he begins his quest to flood the streets of Gotham City with his advanced and cheap pot. The Floronic Man takes some of Poison Ivy's DNA in an attempt to create a \"child\". Poison Ivy, in exchange, gets a trunk full of dope money, and is free to walk away. Deciding that she does not want the Floronic Man running the world, she frees the Batman. After a short battle, the Batman notices that the Floronic Man is standing in a puddle, and uses an electrical cable to electrocute the villain, then decapitates him once again.\n\nThe character has since appeared in various other comics and storylines. He assists Starman, Alan Scott, the Batman and others in trying to save a friendly, peaceful version of Solomon Grundy. In a recent issue of \"Batman\", he is killed after assassins shoot him repeatedly with bullets, although this is in direct contrast to his most famous appearance (in \"The Saga of the Swamp Thing\" #21) in which he points out that \"you can't kill a vegetable by shooting it through the head.\" He is one of the many villains who was mind-wiped by the JLA, but he has since recovered those memories.\n\nDuring \"Infinite Crisis\", the Floronic Man appears as a member of Alexander Luthor Jr.'s Secret Society of Super Villains and takes part in the Battle of Metropolis.\n\nIn the Post-\"Infinite Crisis\" DCU, he is responsible for Pamela Isley's transformation into Poison Ivy.\n\nIn \"The New 52\" (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Woodrue is re-introduced making a deal with the Green by taking care of Alec Holland. Woodrue is later revealed to be the Seeder, now endowed with power by the Parliament of Trees. The Swamp Thing had been hunting him for disrupting the balance of the Green. The Parliament of Trees decides that he and the Swamp Thing must fight, once they have fully realized their powers, to decide who shall be the champion of the Green. As he did in his previous incarnation, he briefly takes the powers of the Swamp Thing, becoming the Champion of the Green, before the Swamp Thing tricks him from within the Green and steals back the title, which nearly kills the Seeder, until the Swamp Thing places him within the Green to save him. He later re-emerges to fight alongside the Swamp Thing against the combined forces of the Metal, the Gray/Fungi and the Rot. He fights the Avatar of the Gray, resulting in both of their deaths.\n\nIn his original form, Jason Woodrue had advanced knowledge of botany, which he used to accelerate plant growth. After becoming the Floronic Man, Woodrue gains the ability to merge with and mentally control plant life. After eating the 'organs' of the Swamp Thing, this power expanded to allow Woodrue to control all of the world's plants for a time, but he lost this power after the Swamp Thing forced him to recognize that destroying the humans and animals would also destroy the plants.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2012742", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2012742", "title": "Critical Beatdown", "text": "Critical Beatdown\n\nCritical Beatdown is the debut studio album by American hip hop group Ultramagnetic MCs, released on October 4, 1988, by Next Plateau Records. Production for the album was handled primarily by the group's rapper and producer Ced-Gee, who employed an E-mu SP-1200 sampler as the album's main instrument. Music journalists have noted the album for its innovative production, funk-based samples, self-assertive themes, ingenious lyricism, and complex rhyme patterns.\n\nAlthough it charted modestly upon its release, \"Critical Beatdown\" has since been acclaimed by critics as a classic album of hip hop's \"golden age\" and new school aesthetic. The album's abstract rhymes in strange syncopations laid on top of sampling experiments proved widely influential, from Public Enemy to gangsta rap to several generations of underground hip hop artists. \"Critical Beatdown\" was reissued by Roadrunner Records in 2004, with additional tracks.\n\nBefore forming as a hip hop group, Ultramagnetic MCs members Cedric \"Ced-Gee\" Miller, \"Kool\" Keith Thornton, DJ Moe Love (Maurice Smith), and TR Love (Trevor Randolph) from The Bronx, New York were break dancers for the New York City Breakers and People's Choice crews. They recorded a demo, \"Space Groove\", in 1984 and released their first single \"To Give You Love\" in 1985. Other singles, including \"Space Groove\" and \"Something Else\", became popular at block parties and earned the group notice in the underground music scene, eventually leading to the group's signing with dance-oriented record label Next Plateau Records.\n\nThe group made a stylistic breakthrough with their subsequent 1986 single \"Ego Trippin'\". The song boasted dense, minimalist production, featuring synthesizer riffs and a drum sample from Melvin Bliss' \"Synthetic Substitution\", and erratic lyricism by Ced-Gee and Kool Keith. The group's 1987 single \"Funky\" showcased Ced-Gee expanding on his production style, incorporating a piano sample from \"Woman to Woman\" by Joe Cocker. Before the release of \"Critical Beatdown\", he contributed to production on albums such as \"Paid in Full\" (1987) by Eric B. & Rakim and \"Criminal Minded\" (1987) by Boogie Down Productions.\n\nThe dynamic, choppy sound featured on \"Critical Beatdown\" was produced primarily by Ced-Gee, who used an E-mu SP-1200 sampler. His sampling of early recordings by James Brown, particularly their guitar and vocal parts, added to the music's abrasive, funk-oriented sound and exemplified the growing popularity of such sampling sources in hip hop at the time. Along with samples of Brown's music, the production utilized drum breaks from commonly sampled sources such as Melvin Bliss' 1973 song \"Synthetic Substitution\". In the second edition of \"The Rough Guide to Hip Hop\" (2005), music journalist Peter Shapiro notes its music's energy as reminiscent of The Cold Crush Brothers and writes of the album's musical significance, \"It may have been a stunning explosion of early sampling technology, but \"Critical Beatdown\" remains a devastating album even in an age of 32-bit samplers and RAM-intensive sound-editing software.\" He also views that the technological limitations of using such a sampler added to the album's style, making the music \"rawer, more immediate, and more febrile, like a raw nerve.\"\n\nHip hop production team The Bomb Squad has cited the album as a major influence on their production for Public Enemy's 1988 album \"It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back\". Music journalist Jeff Chang writes that Ced-Gee \"pushe[d] sampling technology to its early limits, providing sonics that are less bassy and more breakbeat heavy than most of their contemporaries.\" Shapiro dubs it one of the greatest hip hop albums and comments on its musical legacy, \"Recorded at a time before 'street' and 'experimental' were mutually exclusive terms, it ushered in hip-hop's sampladelic golden age and laid the foundation for several generations of underground rap.\"\n\nKool Keith's and Ced-Gee's lyrics on the album are characterized by abstract braggadocio, stream-of-consciousness narrative style, and pseudoscientific terminology. \"The Anthology of Rap\", published by Yale University Press, makes note of such terminology in Ced-Gee's lyricism on the album's 1986 single \"Ego Trippin'\", particularly the lines \"Usin' frequencies and data, I am approximate / Leaving revolutions turning, emerging chemistry / With the precise implications, achieved adversively\". Kool Keith's rhymes are manic and expressed in a staccato pace. His lyrics on \"Ego Trippin'\" also criticize the musical aesthetic of old school hip hop artists at the time: \"They use the simple back and forth, the same old rhythm / That a baby can pick up and join right with them / But their rhymes are pathetic, they think they copasetic / Using nursery terms, at least not poetic\".\n\nAllMusic editor Stanton Swihart found the production innovative and deemed \"Critical Beatdown\" \"an undeniable hip-hop classic [...] one of the finest rap albums from the mid- to late-'80s 'new school' in hip-hop.\" He noted the \"lyrical invention\" of Kool Keith's and Ced-Gee's respective styles, adding that \"Somewhere in the nexus between the two stylistic extremes, brilliant music emanated. \"Critical Beatdown\" maintains all its sharpness and every ounce of its power, and it has not aged one second since 1988.\" \"Trouser Press\" journalist Jeff Chang called it \"an amazing debut\" and complimented Kool Keith's \"shifty rhyme patterns\". \"Pitchfork\"s Alex Linhardt called it \"a flawless album—one that stands tall today as one of Golden Age's most ageless,\" lauding Kool Keith's \"lyrical ingenuity\" and citing Ced-Gee as \"the source of the album's most insane, digitalk-quantum gibberish, spouting lines [...] [T]hey should be studied in seminars alongside general relativity.\" Linhardt attributed its music's \"surging psychosis\" to DJ Moe Love's turntablism and Ced-Gee's dense funk sampling, particularly his arrangement of vocal samples, writing that they \"are ingrained in the very fabric of the beat, concealed and crippled amidst the relentlessly fuzzing bass. And like most great rap albums, many of them come from the patron saint of yelps, James Brown, and flurry and flux with such abstraction and chaos that they make the beats feel deceptively fast-paced.\"\n\n\"Melody Maker\" stated in a retrospective review, \"full of scratch-tastic heavy beat, gold plated hip hop which manages to combine the minimalist ground-breaking Sugar Hill sounds with the show-no-mercy aural assault of the then-emerging Public Enemy.\" \"NME\" called it \"a bona fide classic.\" Sputnikmusic's Louis Arp noted the group's sound as \"developed solely around the sampler\" and stated, \"\"Critical Beatdown\"s notoriety as one of hip-hop's first copyright offenders is more than slightly impressive ... Those grooves, the lyrics and the all around unique feel of the album make for some innovating hip-hop.\" Arp commented that the album \"marks a sign of hip-hop's early burgeoning creative maturity\" and praised Ced-Gee's \"method of chopping up samples, rather than simply looping them like most of his contemporaries did, essentially changed the way the producer approached the hip-hop beat\". \"Rolling Stone\" writer Peter Relic cited it as the group's \"quintessential release.\" Colin Larkin, writing in the \"Encyclopedia of Popular Music\", said that it \"served as a direct influence on the 'Daisy Age' rap of subsequent acts such as De La Soul and PM Dawn\", while singles such as \"Give the Drummer Some\" showed the Ultramagnetic MC's \"in their best light: call and response raps demonstrating individual members self-espoused talent in the best traditions of the old school.\" In \"The Rolling Stone Album Guide\" (2004), journalist Kembrew McLeod called the album \"a bona fide classic of hip-hop's 'golden age' of the late '80s and early '90s, an album that was mostly ignored at the time but whose reputation has grown exponentially in the years since.\"\n\nCredits for \"Critical Beatdown\" adapted from Allmusic.\n\n\nList of songs sampling material from \"Critical Beatdown\" adapted from WhoSampled.\n\n\n\n"}

It has an area of about 0.25 km². It lies within the borders of Incheon metropolitan city, and is about 5 kilometres southwest of Incheon International Airport. Silmido lies just offshore of the larger, inhabited island of Muuido, which is connected to the mainland by ferry. Most of the island consists of hills that are around 80 m high.\n\nSilmido became historically significant when it was used as the training ground (January 21, 1968 to August 23, 1971) for Unit 684, a South Korean military detachment created to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Il-sung in response to The Blue House Raid assassination attempt against President Park Chung-hee. Traces of the training facilities can still be seen. Under circumstances which remain unclear, the members of the group mutinied and went to Seoul in 1971, where they were killed or committed suicide.\n\nOn January 21, 1968, a group of 31 North Korean military soldiers were sent to South Korea by Kim Il-sung to kill President Park Chung-hee. A firefight began when the commandos were just 800 yards from the Blue House (the South Korean Presidential Palace). In all, 68 South Koreans were killed and 66 were wounded, including about two dozen civilians. Three Americans also died defending South Korea's president, and three were wounded.\n\nIn response to the attempted assassination of Park Chung-hee, South Korea began training Unit 684, to infiltrate North Korea and kill Kim Il-sung.\n\nThe assassination mission was subsequently cancelled. On 23 August 1971, for reasons which remain unclear, the members of Unit 684 revolted, killing most of their guards and making their way to the mainland, where they hijacked a bus to Seoul. The bus was stopped by the Army in Daebang-dong, Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul and 20 members of the Unit on board were shot or committed suicide with hand grenades. The four survivors were sentenced to death by a military tribunal and executed on 10 March 1972.\n\nSilmido is well-known today as the principal setting of the 2003 film of the same name, which is based on the true story of Unit 684. Thanks to the film's success, the island has become a fairly popular tourist destination.\n\n"}
{"id": "2012759", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2012759", "title": "Big Yellow Taxi", "text": "Big Yellow Taxi\n\n\"Big Yellow Taxi\" is a song written, composed, and originally recorded by Canadian singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell in 1970, and originally released on her album \"Ladies of the Canyon.\" It was a hit in her native Canada (No. 14) as well as Australia (No. 6) and the UK (No. 11). It only reached No. 67 in the US in 1970, but was later a bigger hit there for her in a live version released in 1974, which peaked at No. 24. Charting versions have also been recorded by the Neighborhood (who had the original top US 40 hit with the track in 1970, peaking at No. 29), Maire Brennan, Amy Grant, Bob Dylan, and Counting Crows.\n\nIn 1996, speaking to journalist Robert Hilburn, Mitchell said this about writing the song:\n\nThe song is known for its environmental concern – \"They paved paradise to put up a parking lot\" and \"Hey farmer, farmer, put away that DDT now\" – and sentimental sound. The line \"They took all the trees, and put 'em in a tree museum / And charged the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em\" refers to Foster Botanical Garden in downtown Honolulu, which is a living museum of tropical plants, some rare and endangered.\n\nIn the song's final verse, the political gives way to the personal. Mitchell recounts the departure of her \"old man\" in the eponymous \"big yellow taxi\", which may refer to the old Metro Toronto Police patrol cars, which until 1986 were painted yellow. In many covers the departed one may be interpreted as variously a boyfriend, a husband or a father. The literal interpretation is that he is walking out on the singer by taking a taxi; otherwise it is assumed he is being taken away by the authorities.\n\nMitchell's original recording was first released as a single and then, as stated above, included on her 1970 album \"Ladies of the Canyon\". A later live version was released in 1974 (1975 in France and Spain) and reached No. 24 on the U.S. charts. Mitchell's playful closing vocals have made the song one of the most identifiable in her repertoire, still receiving significant airplay in Canada. In 2005, it was voted No. 9 on CBC's list of the .\n\nIn 2007, Joni Mitchell released the album \"Shine\", which includes a newly recorded, rearranged version of the song.\n\nThere are various slight alterations of the lyrics from different versions. Joni Mitchell's original version runs:\n\nwhereas in Amy Grant's version, the people are charged \"twenty-five bucks\", and in Mitchell's own 2007 re-recording, the people are charged \"an arm and a leg\". British musician Wally Whyton also recorded the song in 1971, changing the price to \"one pound fifty\" as well as changing \"people\" to \"punters\".\n\nBob Dylan, instead of singing about the \"big yellow taxi\" that \"took away my old man\", sings, \"A big yellow bulldozer took away the house and land.\" Similarly, in Mitchell's live version of the song released on \"Miles of Aisles\" in 1974, she sings about \"a big yellow tractor\" that \"pushed around my house, pushed around my land\". She then repeats the same verse, but with the original lyrics.\nWhile Amy Grant retains the taxi, her final reprise of the line about \"paved paradise\" reads \"steam rolled paradise\".\n\nOn Counting Crows's 2002 cover version, lead singer Adam Duritz sings \"took my girl away\" in place of \"took away my old man\".\n\nAn animated music video of Joni Mitchell's \"Big Yellow Taxi\" was produced by John Wilson of Fine Arts Films as an animated short for the \"Sonny and Cher\" television show in the mid-1970s. The only commercial release of this full-length music video was in the Video Gems home video release on VHS titled \"John Wilson's Mini Musicals\", also released as \"The All Electric Music Movie\". The home video also contains an animated music video of Mitchell's song \"Both Sides, Now\".\n\n\nIn 1993, Máire \"Moya\" Brennan covered the song.\n\n\nIn 1995, American singer Amy Grant released a cover of \"Big Yellow Taxi\" to pop and adult contemporary radio in the United States and United Kingdom. The song was the fourth (third in the US) pop radio single from her 1994 album, \"House of Love\". Grant's version featured slightly altered lyrics, which she changed at Joni Mitchell's request.\n\nThe cover peaked at No. 67 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100, No. 25 in Canada, No. 20 on the UK Singles Chart, and No. 4 in Iceland. Grant also released a music video for the single, which was aired in the US and UK and released to home video on Grant's \"Greatest Videos 1986-2004\" DVD. Grant also performed the song for her 2006 concert album, \"Time Again... Amy Grant Live.\"\n\n\nIn 2002, Counting Crows covered the song with backing vocals by Vanessa Carlton. It was featured on the soundtrack to the film \"Two Weeks Notice\" and is the most successful version of the song to date (U.S. Billboard Adult Top 40). The single was certified Gold on 25 October 2004 by the Recording Industry Association of America. Originally, the song was a hidden track on the band's 2002 album \"Hard Candy\", and it did not include Carlton until it was to be featured in the film. New releases of the album included it as a track with her added, as with her in the video (which was shot on Coney Island, Brooklyn, and in nearby Bensonhurst), although Counting Crows and Carlton neither appeared in the video together nor recorded together. This song became the band's only Top 20 single in the UK, peaking at No. 13. This version slightly changed Mitchell's original lyrics to describe when the eponymous taxi \"took my girl away\", instead of Mitchell's \"took away my old man\". The original version of the song without Vanessa was included on the album \"Nolee Mix\", which was released to promote the My Scene dolls.\n\n\"The Village Voice\" named this cover the worst song of the 2000s, and the \"Village Voice's\" scathing review of the cover is archived on Joni Mitchell's website. Additionally, \"NME\" also included this cover on its list of the worst songs of the 2000s, and \"Ultimate Classic Rock\" highlighted this song in its \"Terrible Classic Rock Covers\" series.\n\n\nMany other artists have covered the song.\n\n"}

The UN General Assembly adopted this resolution on 1 February 1952 during its sixth session after the Republic of China complained to the United Nations against the Soviet Union.\nThe Empire of Japan invaded Manchuria (Northeast part of the former Qing Empire, not part of the Core China, occupied by Chinese in 1922) in 1931 and established Manchukuo in 1932. The Republic of China protested the Japanese invasion and the League of Nations voted 42-1 (only Japan voted against) to pass the Lytton Report to demand Manchuria be returned to China, but Japan refused to comply and left the League of Nations. China neither recognized Manchukuo nor was able to recover Manchuria.\n\nIn World War II, one Soviet precondition for a declaration of war against Japan was an American recognition of Mongolian independence from China, and a recognition of Soviet interests in the Manchurian railways and Port Arthur; these were agreed without Chinese representation or consent. The Soviet threat of seizing parts of Inner Mongolia induced China to recognize Outer Mongolia's independence, provided that a referendum be held. The referendum took place on 20 October 1945, with (according to official numbers) 100% of the electorate voting for independence. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, both countries confirmed their mutual recognition on 6 October 1949. In line with the concluding statement of the Yalta Conference and to receive the southern part of Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands after the defeat of Japan, Soviet Union immediately fought against Japan. Later, the USSR and the Republic of China signed the Treaty of Friendship and Alliance with the Republic of China on 14 August 1945. However, the National Government of the Republic of China believed the Soviet Union violated the treaty because it obstructed the efforts of the Republic of China to re-establish national authority in Manchuria and aided the Communist Party of China by giving it weapons surrendered by the Japanese Imperial Army. Additionally, the Soviet Union handed territorial control to the Chinese Communist Party in that area against United States Marines aided military dispatchment and installation of Nationalist Government in North East China during the early period of Chinese Civil War after 1945.\n\nIn 1949, the Communist Party of China won the Chinese Civil War, resulting in the establishment of the People's Republic of China on 1 October 1949. The Kuomintang government of the Republic of China was forced to retreat to Taiwan, where it continued to maintain itself as the sole legitimate government of all China and declared the Communist government to be illegitimate. With the support of the Western bloc amid the Cold War, the Republic of China was able to retain the seat of China in the United Nations despite having lost so much territory to the Communists.\n\nIn 1952, the Republic of China filed a complaint to the United Nations against the Soviet Union, which it resented for aiding the Communists in the Civil War. The UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 505 to condemn the Soviet Union, with 25 countries supporting the resolution, 9 countries opposing it, 24 countries abstaining, and 2 countries not voting.\n\nOn 24 February 1953, the Legislative Yuan of the Republic of China abolished the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance and refused to recognize the independence of the Mongolian People's Republic. The Republic of China considered Resolution 505 a diplomatic victory, even though the hope of recovering of mainland China and Mongolia grew increasingly dimmer as time went by. The Republic of China vetoed the Mongolian bid for UN membership in 1955, but pressure from the Soviet bloc, Third World states and non-aligned states eventually forced the Republic of China to stop blocking Mongolia, so Mongolia joined the UN in 1961 in exchange for the Republic of China's seat to be retained by votes in the General Assembly in the same year at that time.\n\nOn 21 May 2012, the Mainland Affairs Council released a press release saying that Outer Mongolia is not a part of the Republic of China, whilst the Constitutional Court of the Republic of China (regarding interpretation of the Republic of China constitution) and the Republic of China's Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission remained neutral on the Mongolian issue. Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs opened a representative office in Mongolia in 2002 with reciprocity from Mongolia in Taiwan in 2003.\n\n"}

{"id": "2012783", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2012783", "title": "Oliver Humperdink", "text": "Oliver Humperdink\n\nJohn Jay Sutton (January 16, 1949 – March 20, 2011), better known by his ring name Oliver Humperdink, was an American professional wrestling manager and occasional professional wrestler who worked for Jim Crockett Promotions, Florida Championship Wrestling, World Wrestling Federation and World Championship Wrestling.\n\nIn the early and mid-1960s, John Sutton began to get to know several wrestlers while working as an usher in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He eventually landed a job as a security guard for the American Wrestling Association (AWA). In 1973, he met Paul Vachon when he went to work at Grand Prix Wrestling (GPW) in Montreal. At GPW, Sutton worked as a manager and an occasional wrestler. He also refereed for a time. Sutton began managing the Hollywood Blonds after they split with their manager, Johnny Rougeau. Both Don Jardine and Dale Hey are credited with coming up with the name \"Sir Oliver Humperdink\". Jardine claims to have come up with the name, believing it would draw heat from francophone fans in Quebec who hated anything English. \n\nIn 1974, Humperdink went to Florida Championship Wrestling and was put into an angle with Mike Graham and Kevin Sullivan. Two years later, he began working with the Hollywood Blondes once again. In 1980 Humperdink became Dusty Rhodes' servant for thirty days after his protege Ivan Koloff lost a match to Rhodes with that stipulation. During the thirty days, Lord Alfred Hayes began managing Humperdink's proteges such as Bobby Jaggers and Nikolai Volkoff. When \"Rooster\" Humperdink (as Rhodes had nicknamed him), who had become a figure of sympathy during his thirty days' servitude, returned to management and attempted to claim back Jaggers, Hayes and Volkoff brutally beat on him, thus starting a feud with Hayes.\n\nHe worked for the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA)'s Jim Crockett Promotions in the 1980s where he managed Greg Valentine, , Paul Jones and The One Man Gang. He left the company in 1983 but returned five years later shortly before the company was bought out by Ted Turner and became World Championship Wrestling. While still in the NWA, he formed a stable known as the \"House of Humperdink\". As a singles wrestler, he held the NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship and NWA Central States Television Championship.\n\nIn 1987, the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) approached Humperdink and offered him a job. As a part of the WWF, he managed Bam Bam Bigelow. That same year, he also began managing Paul Orndorff during his feud with Rick Rude. His gimmick was that of a face, but Sutton did not like the gimmick off-screen. He managed the duo during the first-ever Survivor Series in a match that they lost when Bigelow was pinned by André the Giant. Humperdink also managed Bigelow during WrestleMania IV when he lost in the first round of a WWF Championship tournament.\n\nWhen he returned to the NWA in 1988, he managed The New Wild Samoans (Fatu, Samu, and The Samoan Savage). He also returned to the side of Bigelow in his feud with Barry Windham in a match at Starrcade.\n\nHe worked for World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in the early 1990s as \"Big Daddy Dink\", a biker-type gimmick. In WCW, he managed The Fabulous Freebirds (Michael Hayes and Jimmy Garvin). Off-screen, Sutton hated his new gimmick and WCW's office politics. He retired in 1993. In 1995 he returned to manage Bob Orton Jr. and The Hangmen in the American Wrestling Federation.\n\nIn the 1960s, Sutton was in a car crash and nearly died when he hit a snow bank. After recovering from the incident, his health deteriorated. In 2001, he went through surgery to replace his aortic valve in Key West. He was equipped with a pacemaker and made a full recovery. The Cauliflower Alley Club, whose conventions he attended every year, helped pay for some of his medical expenses. Sutton returned to the hospital in 2008 after heart troubles complicated a case of pneumonia. In early 2011, it was announced that Sutton was diagnosed with cancer of the bladder. He entered a hospice having refused chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Sutton died early on the morning of March 20, 2011, of complications from pneumonia and cancer at the age of 62. Sutton never married or had children.\n\n"}

PepsiCo's other drink brands, including Mountain Dew and Gatorade, also have a variety of famous spokespersons.\n\nCelebrities have been paid to advertise for Pepsi products.\n\nJoan Crawford was married to PepsiCo president Alfred Steele from 1955 to 1959 (his death), and was advertising executive and board of directors member from 1959 to 1973.\n\nDuring the 1960s, Joanie Sommers sang two popular commercial songs (\"It's Pepsi, for those who think young\" and \"Now you see it, now you don't, oh, Diet Pepsi\") for Pepsi-Cola that were run in commercials and for which she came to be often referred to as \"The Pepsi Girl\"\nin 1974 Joseph Nicoletti, then of Brooklyn N.Y. now music-film consultant, Laguna Beach, California, sung and produced the theme \"You're Drinking Diet Pepsi and it Shows.\" Hal Linden (Barney Miller) did the voice over and it was a BBD&O hit Commercial. Nicoletti was signed by legendary ad man Phil Dusenberry. Inducted into the Advertising Hall of Fame, Dusenberry wrote the script \"The Natural.\" Dusenberry said Nicoletti was one of the best singing Voices in the business.\n\nIn 1984, Michael Jackson signed a contract with Pepsi that produced many commercials and world tours through 1993.\n\nDuring the 1989 Grammy Awards telecast, Pepsi and Puerto Rican singer Chayanne was featured in the first advertising spot in Spanish to be broadcast on national television without dubbing or subtitles.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Ray Charles was the star of a Diet Pepsi campaign called \"You Got the Right One, Baby,\" which was also known as \"Uh-huh.\"\n\nDuring the late 1990s the Spice Girls became the face of Pepsi with the tagline “Generation Next” inspired by their song Move Over from their album \"Spiceworld\". Promotion included TV commercials, CD singles for the promo single \"Step to Me\", and collectible cans and glasses with each Spice Girl on a different can or cup.\n\nIn 2001, Britney Spears became a spokesperson for Pepsi. During her contract Spears did many commercials including ones for the World Cup and other major events. Spears' contract concluded with an advertisement with Pink, Beyoncé Knowles, and Enrique Iglesias. The ad was made featuring the cover of the song \"We Will Rock You\" by Queen set in a Roman gladiator arena.\n\nIn 2004, Beyoncé, Jennifer Lopez, and David Beckham all starred in a commercial for the brand together, featuring the two singers as assassin-like characters.\n\nIn 2005, Christina Aguilera was signed to promote the popular drink (she was previously promoting Coca-Cola in 2000). The campaign featuring Aguilera was released in 2006, but not in the United States. Some commercials featured singer Elissa, and some with Aguilera by herself. PepsiCo said in a recent interview that Christina Aguilera has that 'dare for more' approach. Aretha Franklin was also a spokesperson in 1998. And also in 1999 Janet Jackson signed on to the original \"Ask For More\" campaign which featured a song of the same name written and sung by Jackson.\n\nIn 2006, PepsiCo and Motorola launched the \"Cool Tones\" campaign. It involved Mariah Carey, Mary J. Blige and The All American Rejects writing and performing ringtones that could be obtained by purchasing a Pepsi bottle. The artists also filmed commercials for the campaign in which they perform their original ringtones.\n\nIn 2012, Beyoncé was signed to promote Pepsi once again. This campaign will be her fifth for the soft drink since 2002 — and her face will be on a limited-edition line of soda cans. The multiyear campaign is estimated at $50 million, the bulk of it for media placements and promotions around the world, and the remainder split roughly equally between Beyoncé’s fee and what Pepsi calls a creative content development fund.\n\nNicki Minaj signed a promotional deal with Pepsi in February 2012. A commercial was released which includes her hit single, \"Moment 4 Life\", on Sunday, May 6 at approximately 6:06 pm.\n\nNASCAR driver Jeff Gordon is a spokesperson for Pepsi, and was sponsored by the company starting in 1997 as an associate sponsor, and sponsored Gordon in the Busch Series for two seasons.

The Pepsi livery was a new addition to grand prix motorcycling, and a change from tobacco sponsors.\n\nDuring 1988-9, Suzuki also produced a number of road going replicas of the GP bikes, emblazoned with the same Pepsi signage as the works bikes. Due to the livery's association with one of Suzuki's riders, the Texan, Kevin Schwantz, riders today are still producing their own replicas as tribute.\n\nIn 1998, the group Spice Girls have been spokeswomen in the international campaign. The ad was featuring the song \"Move Over (Generation Next)\".\n\nSince 2001, Sakis Rouvas has been a spokesperson in the Greek and Balkan campaign under contract with the headquarters of United Kingdom, being the only Greek artist to have ever been proposed to represent the brand.\n\nSince summer 2009, Inna is the spokeswoman in Romania, Moldova and secondly in Bulgaria, Hungary and Serbia. She promoted Pepsi mostly in Romania, Moldova and Bulgaria through TV commercials and internet adverts. Some commercials have been translated from Romanian into Bulgarian or even Hungarian.\n\nIn Latin America, Colombian artists Shakira, and Juanes; Dominican Sammy Sosa, and Puerto Rican Daddy Yankee have promoted the soft drink.

{"id": "2012849", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2012849", "title": "Early Entrance Program (CSU)", "text": "Early Entrance Program (CSU)\n\nThe Early Entrance Program (EEP) is an early college entrance program for gifted individuals of middle-school and high school ages at California State University, Los Angeles (CSULA) based on a similar program of the same name at the University of Washington, Seattle campus (the Transition School and Early Entrance Program). The program allows participants to skip normal schooling and become full-time, degree-seeking college students. Although there are a number of early college entry programs, EEP is the only one of its kind in the United States in promoting a direct transitional scheme from middle and high school to college without intermediary remedial education. Recently, EEP has attracted national media attention. Applicants to EEP generally come from the Greater Los Angeles Area, but some come from all over the United States as well as international locales.\n\nThe Director of the Early Entrance Program is in charge of all of EEP's operations. This position can be compared to a combination of an American high school principal and an academic advisor/counselor. The former Director (until Spring 2018) was Richard Maddox, EdD, who has his doctorate from the University of Southern California (USC) in Educational Psychology. Maddox is responsible for the current EEP design, and has been the director of the Program since the 1995-1996 academic year. He has also encouraged EEP publicity, projecting it to nationally recognized status. Presently, EEP is under the jurisdiction of the Director of the Honors College, with an EEP Assistant Director overseeing daily operations. The current Assistant Director is Dr. Andrea Arias, EdD who has her doctorate from Pepperdine University.\n\nEvery year, approximately 100-500 gifted students from all over the United States apply to EEP. However, each fall, only 20-35 applicants are admitted, after being screened by the ACT (American College Test) or the SAT and undergoing a rigorous assessment period taking college-level courses during the \"Honors Academy\". The screening test was formerly the WPCT (the Washington Pre-College Test).\n\nAn EEP applicant's first step is taking the American College Test OR the SAT. The ACT is a standardized test for high school achievement and college admissions in the United States produced by ACT, Inc. It was first administered in fall 1959 by Everett Franklin Lindquist as a competitor to the College Board's Scholastic Aptitude Test, now the SAT Reasoning Test. Some students who perform poorly on the SAT find that they perform better on the ACT and vice versa. The ACT test has historically consisted of four tests: English, Math, Reading, and Science reasoning. In February 2005, an optional writing test was added to the ACT, mirroring changes to the SAT that took place later in March of the same year. All four-year colleges and universities in the U.S. accept the ACT, but different institutions place different emphases on standardized tests such as the ACT, compared to other factors of evaluation such as class rank, G.P.A., and extracurricular activities. If the ACT is taken at one of two annual testings administered at CSULA, the applicant does not complete the writing portion. The applicants to CSULA's PACE program also take this test. To qualify for the EEP, an applicant must score 23 or higher on the Math section and 24 or higher on the English section. To qualify with the SAT the applicant must score above a 510 on both the Critical Reading and Math sections.\n\nEach school year, the ACT is held in December and April at California State University. EEP is in charge of organizing and proctoring these two testings. EEPsters volunteer to assist in the administration of the exam. On average, approximately three hundred fifty students take the ACT in December and four hundred students in April. The location for both testings is Martin Luther King Hall at CSULA. Some years, when there are fewer applicants (i.e. 2009), there is only one testing.\n\nScores for the ACT are mailed to the home of students usually one to two weeks after the date of the test. similar to the SAT, the maximum score of each portion of the test is 36. To quality for application to EEP, the student must have a minimum of 23 points in Mathematics and 22 points in the English section.\n\nAfter these requirements are met, ACT scores have no influence over the application process. In other words, an applicant to EEP with a score of 33 will have no advantage over another student who scored 25.\n\nThe first step of applying to the Early Entrance Program (after passing the Washington Pre-College Test) is scheduling an interview with the Early Entrance Program Director. At this interview, prospective candidates are informed briefly about the application process and the Pre-Summer Orientation. Most students pass the interview.\n\nEvery prospective student (formerly referred to as \"Provisionals\" or \"Provies\") is required to attend an orientation with every other candidate for the program, as well as parents. This orientation usually occurs in late May and is coordinated by the EEP Director. Students at this orientation receive information about the various aspects of the summer application process.\n\nThe Provisional Summer Quarter is both an evaluation process and a taste of what EEP life is like for all Provisional students. Provies must take 2 academic classes at CSULA and maintain a minimum 3.0 GPA for the summer quarter (which spans approximately 6 weeks). Provisionals also are encouraged to spend time in the EEP Lounge (King Hall D140-142) interacting with other provisionals and regular students. \n\nThere are three Provisional Freshmen Orientations that take place during the summer quarter. Unlike the Pre-Summer Orientation, these orientations are for provisional students without their parents. At the beginning of the summer during these meetings, every provisional selects a Mentor Group. Mentors are regular students in the program that volunteer to help Provies with the summer application process by assisting and assessing them.\n\nAround the sixth to seventh week of the provisional semester, anywhere from 25 to 40 students who are strong candidates for the program are advanced to EEP candidacy status, contingent on University entrance. These students are then admitted to the EEP and begin classes at CSULA in the following Fall semester.\n\nThere are approximately 120 students in the Early Entrance Program, known as \"EEPsters\". As in American high schools, EEPsters in their first year at EEP are referred to as \"Freshmen\", or more commonly, continue to be referred to as Provies, second year as \"Sophomores\", third year as \"Juniors\", and fourth year and above as \"Seniors\" or \"Elders\". Although EEP is designed to be a five-year program, some students stay in EEP more than or less than five years to earn their degree. After three years students are promoted to the status of Elders which may be equated to the upperclassman of high school environments. EEPsters are an eclectic (and eccentric) group of adolescents, and are derived from a variety of social, ethnic, and economical backgrounds. These varied personalities all contribute to a unique environment often considered a social asylum for most applicants from the typical education environment.\n\nAlthough initial concerns regarding adjustment run rampant, several intermediary steps are taken to ensure a smooth transition from a secondary school setting to university life. EEPsters on campus share a common abode in the affectionately dubbed Lounge, or 'EEP room', which, for the initial years, serves as a social hive in which EEPsters can work, socialize, or merely relax. This, in addition to the relatively small and exclusive nature of the program, results in a close-knit consequence of 'everybody-knowing-everybody' and certainly never a paucity of human interaction—or dull moments. Additional preparatory steps have been taken in recent years, including the addition of a Study Hall to freshmen curricula. All EEP students are supported by a full-time staff, which consist of a Student Counselor and a Student Assistant. Ultimately, with the aid of a familial environment and the omnipresence of guidance from EEP Elders, most freshmen adjust quickly to collegiate life. Elder EEPsters usually work to expand their social schemata, and become active participants in university life, assimilating inconspicuously into roles of community service, organizations, and student governments.\n\nThe EEPsters have great opportunities and are encouraged to socialize with each other and other university students. In fact, they have participated greatly in many of CSULA's on-campus clubs and organizations including General Education Honors Club, Associated Students Incorporated (ASI Student Governance) and multiple research laboratories.\n\nFounded several years ago by EEP students, the Early Entrance Program Club (EEP Club) serves as a student government for the EEP population. EEP Club sponsors free tutoring for all EEPsters and coordinates various social events as well. \n\nEEP Club has flourished over the past 11 years under the leadership of Harry B., Jackson V., Herbert L., Andrew P., Pam L., Cory O., Margaret L., Millie G., John S., Jaquelyn Y., Adrian B., Grant J., Samuel H., Andre L., Paolo A., Lily N., and John L.\n\nThe current Administration consists of:\n\nPresident: Amanda T.\n\nVice President: George P.\n\nTreasurer: TBD\n\n"}

This bacterium affects plants, particularly types of maize such as sweet, flint, dent, flower, and popcorn. The disease is also known as bacterial wilt or bacterial leaf blight and has shown to be quite problematic in sweet corn. The disease is endemic in the mid-Atlantic and Ohio River Valley regions and in the southern portion of the Corn Belt.\n\nStewart's wilt can be a serious disease of many corn types, including: sweet, dent, flint, flower, and popcorn. Sweet corn and popcorn cultivars are more susceptible to Stewart's wilt than field (dent) corn, but some dent corn inbreds and hybrids are susceptible. The production of virulence factor can be caused by the communication system between the bacteria known as quorum sensing. Stewart's wilt causes yield reductions by decreasing the size of corn stand or by limiting its production, resulting in fewer and smaller ears of corn.\n\nThe disease is seen in parts of Arkansas, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. Its occurrence in other eastern and Stewart’s wilt has two phases of symptoms: the wilt phase and the leaf blight phase. For both phases, symptoms first appear as leaf lesions, initiating from corn flea beetle feeding scars. At first, the leaf lesions appear long and irregularly shaped and are light green to yellow and later on, straw colored. On mature plants, yellowish streaks with wavy margins extend along the leaf veins. This leaf blight phase is often prevalent after tasseling and the symptoms look similar to frost damage, drought, nutrient disorders, northern corn leaf blight (caused by \"Exserohilum turcicum\"), and particularly Goss's wilt (caused by \"Clavibacter michiganensis\" ssp. \"nebraskensis\"). A good way to determine if the corn is facing symptoms from Stewart's wilt is to look at the leaf tissue under microscope. If the bacterial ooze exhibits nonflagellated, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacteria, the likelihood of Stewart's wilt is great.\n\nThe corn flea beetle feeds on corn leaf tissue and then transmits the \"P. stewartii\" bacterium into the plant. When large populations of corn flea beetles are feeding, skeletonization of leaves and death of seedlings can occur.\n\nIn most cases, the wilt phase occurs on seedlings, but for certain corn types (i.e. sweet corn), more mature plants can wilt. The wilt phase is systemic, meaning the majority of the plant is infected via bacterial movement and colonization of the plant's vascular system. When the bacterium spreads within the plant, leaves begin withering and can die. Plants become stunted and at times, the whole plant may wilt and die. Dwarfed, bleached tassels are common. Often, plants that have wilt symptoms also have leaf blight symptoms.\n\nWhen the bacteria reach the corn stalks, the vascular bundles become brown and necrotic. A good indicator of whether or not the bacteria have infected the stalks is if yellow masses of bacteria are oozing from the vascular bundles. With certain sweet-corn hybrids, yellow, slimy ooze collects on the inner ear husks and/or covers the corn kernels. The kernels may also have grayish lesions with dark margins or they may be irregular in shape and dwarfed. Another common symptom of the bacteria is formation of open cavities within the stalk tissue. While the plants are weak and vulnerable, stalk rot fungi can further invade the corn plant.\n\n\"Chaetocnema pulicaria\", the primary vector for \"P. stewartii\", overwinters as adults and begins feeding on corn seedlings early in the spring. The bacterium overwinters in the gut of the adult corn flea beetles. Warmer winter temperatures allow for greater beetle survival and in effect, higher populations in the spring. Emerging beetles in the spring transmit the bacteria into corn leaf tissue through feeding. The corn flea beetles wound the leaf and contaminate the wounds with insect frass (excrement), which additionally contains the bacteria. Once the bacteria are inside the plant, they multiply and fill the xylem and intercellular spaces of the leaves. The degree of multiplication is highly dependent on susceptibility of the cultivar. Highly susceptible plants become systemically infected and face symptoms such as stunting, wilting, and death. In less severe cases, a plant may show long and irregularly shaped leaf lesions. Some genotypes are able to greatly restrict pathogenic growth. In such plants, the leaf lesions are short, insignificant, or may even be nonexistent. In certain corn varieties, kernels can be infected later in the growing season after flowering occurs. Although corn kernels can be a source of inoculum, seed transmission is quite rare.\n\nThe number of flea beetles emerging in spring from hibernation depends on the severity of winter temperatures. Warm winter temperatures favor the survival of flea beetle vectors and increase the risk of Stewart’s disease. The numbers of emerging adults can be estimated by calculating a winter temperature index by averaging the mean temperatures (expressed in °F) for December, January, and February. If the sum of the mean temperatures is 90 °F or greater, the beetles will survive in high numbers and the disease risk is high; if the sum is between 85° and 90°, the risk is moderate to high; 80° to 85°, moderate to low; and a sum less than 80 °F represents low risk.\n\nFlea beetles do not survive in the northern half of Illinois due to low winter temperatures. Those found in late spring or summer have migrated from the south. Snow or other winter cover apparently provides insufficient shelter to enhance survival of the overwintering flea beetles. Prolonged periods of wet summer weather are unfavorable for beetle multiplication and feeding, while dry weather is favorable. Consequently, although this disease has been found throughout the world, the bacterium has never survived and spread other than in North America, because the disease depends on where \"C. pulicaria\" occurs. In North America, Stewart’s wilt is found in the mid-Atlantic and the Ohio River Valley regions and in the southern portion of the Corn Belt. This region includes parts of Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia, and West Virginia. Stewart’s wilt can also be found in eastern and midwestern states and portions of Canada, but this depends on whether or not the corn flea beetles survive the winters. Corn flea beetles can transmit the bacteria northward during the summer, but if the insect vectors cannot survive the harsh winter temperatures, then the bacteria cannot be spread. The toothed flea beetle, adult 12-spotted cucumber beetle, seed corn maggot, wheat wireworm, white grubs, and larvae of corn rootworms can also carry \"P. stewartii\" from one plant to another during the summer. These pests cannot overwinter and transmit this disease.\n\nAll sweet corn varieties are susceptible to wilt in the first leaf stage. Susceptibility decreases and natural control is obtained as plants grows older. External disease control is conducted by insecticide spraying to stop early feeding of overwintering flea beetles. Insecticides should be sprayed as soon as corn first breaks the soil surface. When establishing control measures, spraying should be repeated several times to regulate the presence of the insecticide products in the field. Common insecticides used for control of Stewart's wilt are clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam. These insecticides are most effectively used at rates of 1.25 (mg ai/kernel), with clothianidin being the most effective at that rate. Application rates on the labels may vary a little, so follow the label rates for each insecticide. Better results are obtained when seeds are sprayed prior to germination. In furrow spraying and post-germination foliar spraying may not be effective.\n\nAlthough insecticides are effective, resistant hybrids are the best means of disease control. Hybrid varieties of sweet corn are also available for control. Dent corn hybrids are more resistant to the disease than sweet corn, hence do not require insecticides.\n\nIn sweet corn, losses are as significant as hybrid varieties, but are only used on a periodic basis. The susceptible varieties cause losses ranging from 40 to 100% when infected prior to the five-leaf stage. The losses are 15–35% and 3–15% for seven-leaf and nine-leaf stages, respectively. Stewart's wilt may add additional costs for phytosanitary regulations from trading partners. Such regulations primarily affect seed commerce by preventing seed from being exported or by creating additional costs for phytosanitary inspections prior to export. During epidemics in the 1990s, Stewart's wilt was a significant economic issue for the corn seed industry because of the logistics of trading and exchange of large volumes of field corn seed throughout the world. Stewart's wilt also creates indirect costs for seed producers because resources must be used to screen germplasm and breed corn for Stewart's wilt resistance to develop hybrids that efficiently and effectively control the disease. In Kentucky, the disease causes huge losses for corn producers. Stewart's wilt impacts include stand reductions, production of fewer and smaller ears, and an increased susceptibility of wilt-infected plants to stalk rotting organisms.\n\nStewart's wilt was first observed by T.J. Burrill in the late 1880s while studying fire blights in the corn fields of southern Illinois. Burrill associated the symptoms he found with dry weather and chinch bug damage, yet he indicated that bacteria could be the cause for the disease. Nonetheless, he was unable to complete Koch's postulates to determine the causal pathogen of the disease.\n\nThen, in 1895, F.C. Stewart observed wilt in sweet-corn plants in Long Island, NY. After completion of Koch's postulates with the bacteria in sweet corn, Stewart gave an accurate account of the symptoms and named the pathogen \"Pseudomonas stewartii\" in 1898. With the help of his colleagues, Stewart concluded that the bacteria were readily disseminated by seed. Another 25 years later, a corn flea beetle, \"Chaetocnema pulicaria\", was identified as the primary vector responsible for the midseason spread of the disease.\n\nThe taxonomy of the pathogen was under debate for half a century, when in 1963, D.W. Dye named it \"Erwinia stewartii\". Dye did so because the pathogen is closely related to other bacteria in the \"Erwinia herbicola-Enterobacter agglomerans\" complex. Recently, the complex was assigned to the genus, \"Pantoea,\" which did not agree with the results from the 16S RNA sequence analysis. Due to this difference, the pathogen was named, \"Erwinia stewartii,\" and has most recently been named, \"Pantoea stewartii\".\n\nStewart's wilt was primarily responsible for the development of the first widely grown, single-cross hybrid, 'Golden Cross Bantam'. In 1923, Glenn Smith, a USDA scientist working at Purdue University, created a hybrid from two different lines of the regular, susceptible 'Golden Bantam'. The hybrid was tested in one of the most destructive epidemics of Stewart's wilt in northern Indiana. After a successful performance, the hybrid was legalized and named 'Golden Cross Bantam'. Within a few years, 70–80% of the sweet corn canned in the US was that cultivar.\n\n"}

It was founded in 1844 by nine prominent sportsmen. The members have contributed to the sport of yachting and yacht design. As of 2001, the organization was reported to have about 3,000 members. Membership in the club is by invitation only. Its officers include a commodore, vice-commodore, rear-commodore, secretary and treasurer.\n\nThe America's Cup trophy was won by members in 1851 and held by the NYYC until 1983. The NYYC successfully defended the trophy twenty-four times in a row before being defeated by the Royal Perth Yacht Club, represented by the yacht \"Australia II\". The NYYC's reign was the longest winning streak as measured by years in the history of all sports.\n\nThe NYYC has entered 2021 America's Cup under the syndicate name \"American Magic\".\n\nIn 1845, the club's first clubhouse was established — a modest, Gothic-revival building in Hoboken, New Jersey, on land donated by Commodore John Cox Stevens. After outgrowing its cramped quarters, the club moved to several other locations, including Staten Island, Glen Cove, New York and Mystic, Connecticut.\n\nIts primary clubhouse is a six-storied Beaux-Arts landmark with a nautical-themed limestone facade, located at 37 West 44th Street in midtown Manhattan. Opened in 1901, the clubhouse was designed by Warren and Wetmore (1898), architects of the exterior of Grand Central Terminal. The centerpiece of the clubhouse is the \"Model Room\", which contains a notable collection of full and half hull models including a scale model history of all New York Yacht Club America's Cup challenges. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987.\n\nIn addition to its Manhattan headquarters, located inland, the club maintains \"Harbour Court\", a clubhouse opened in 1988 on the water in Newport.\n\nThe New York Yacht Club was founded on July 30, 1844, by nine gentlemen. John Cox Stevens, the leader of this group, and a prominent citizen of New York with a passion for sports, was elected commodore. John Clarkson Jay of Rye, one of the nine founders, was a grandson of Founding Father John Jay and served as the first Secretary of the board. George L. Schuyler and Hamilton Wilkes were also NYYC founders who, together with Stevens and two others, created the syndicate that built and raced the great schooner-yacht, \"America\". Wilkes served as the club's first vice-commodore. Schuyler played a key role in the founding of the America's Cup regatta, and served as its unofficial consultant until his death in 1890.\n\nIn 1845, the club's burgee was designed. The waters off Newport have been a key sailing venue for the NYYC since the beginning of its history. Indeed, the day the club was founded in 1844, its members resolved to sail from the Battery to Newport. Two days later, they did, with several stops on the way, and trials of speed.\n\nDuring the first decades of the club's history, racing for prize money was the objective among most members. In 1851, a syndicate of NYYC enthusiasts built and raced \"America\", capturing the \"One Hundred Sovereign Cup\" at the annual regatta of the Royal Yacht Squadron. On July 8, 1857, the coveted trophy was donated to the NYYC, to serve as a challenge cup for sportsmanlike competition between nations. The \"America's Cup Race\", named for its first winner, played a central role in the history of the club until this day.\n\nIn 1865, the Club was incorporated, adopting the Latin motto: \"Nos agimur tumidis velis\" -- \"We go with swelling sails\" (adapted from the verse of the famous Roman poet Horace, \"Non agimur tumidis uelis\", \"We do not go with swelling sails\", in \"Epistles\", 2, 2, 201). During this time, membership transitioned from the \"old guard\" to a new generation of yachtsmen, who built large schooner yachts captained by professionals. Marking this evolution was the 1866 resignation of Commodore Edwin Augustus Stevens, brother of founder John Cox Stevens and member of the \"America\" syndicate.\n\nThe year 1866 is remembered in club annals for the legendary \"Transatlantic Race\". In December, the NYYC schooners \"Henrietta\", \"Fleetwing\", and \"Vesta\" raced from Sandy Hook to The Needles, Isle of Wight for a $90,000 winner-take-all prize. The \"Henrietta\", owned by 21-year-old James Gordon Bennett, Jr., and skippered by Captain Samuel S. Samuels, a professional, won the race in 13 days, 21 hours and 55 minutes. Bennett would be elected commodore in 1871.\n\nIn 1876, the \"Mohawk\", a large centerboard schooner, capsized due to its sheets being \"made fast\" (fastened securely) when a freak squall struck. Vice-Commodore William T. Garner, his wife and crew died in the accident. It is believed that this tragedy led to the extinction of the great centerboard schooner yachts. The Mohawk was later sold to the U.S. Navy and recommissioned as the U.S. Eagre.\n\nBy 1894, the New York Yacht Club had a number of Clubhouses: Station 1 in Bay Ridge; 2 in New York NY; 3 in Whitestone NY; 4 in New London, Connecticut; 5 in Shelter Island, New York; 6 in Newport RI; 7 in Vineyard Haven and at Rendezvous Glen Cove. In 1868, the club bought a big mansion used as Station 2 at Rosebank, Staten Island. This building still stands and is known as the Macfarlane Bredt House.\nIn 1895, Richard H. Barker composed 'The yacht club march: march and two-step: for piano' in honour of the New York Yacht Club.\n\nIn 1994, as part of the Club's 150th celebrations, Melissa H. Harrington wrote 'The New York Yacht Club, 1844-1994,' \n\nFollowing the disastrous Bay of Quinte America's Cup challenge in 1881, the Club's committee voted a new rule to govern its races:\n\nThe America's Cup challenges of 1885, 1886 and 1887 used this rule with an waterline length limit. In 1887, the NYYC adopted the Seawanhaka Corinthian Yacht Club's rating rule, which handicapped length comparatively less. Then, in 1903, the NYYC changed its rating system to the \"Herreshoff Rule\", devised by the yacht designer, Nathanael Herreshoff. Later renamed the \"Universal Rule\", it would be adopted by the majority of leading American yacht clubs. The rule governed yacht design for almost forty years.\n\nThe America's Cup was held for 132 years, from 1851 until \"Australia II\" defeated Dennis Conner's \"Liberty\" off Newport, Rhode Island in 1983. This record remains the longest winning streak in sports history.\n\nSince the loss of the Cup the NYYC has been forced to reinvent itself and the Club has become involved in team racing, dinghy racing, youth sailing, and international regattas. In 2002 the Club hosted the Intercollegiate Sailing Association Sloop North American Championships. In 2006 the Club hosted the Blind Sailing World Championships.\n\nThe NYYC will enter 2021 America's Cup, under the syndicate name \"American Magic\", with a team led by Terry Hutchinson and Bella Mente Quantum Racing Association. In May 2018, it was announced that Dean Barker will helm the boat. \n\"American Magic\" references the first Cup winner, the yacht America, and the first defender, the yacht Magic.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease at age 40.\n\nHe was a brazen sprinter and a star of the 7-Eleven Cycling Team in the 1980s and early ’90s, and is the leader in race victories by an American, with 328. In 1986, he became the second American to win a stage at the Tour de France, while riding for American-based 7-Eleven. His racing career spanned two decades and included two stage victories in the Tour de France, a United States National Road Race Championships title, and the 1984 Olympic Bronze Medal in the Men's 100 km Team Time Trial along with Ron Kiefel, Roy Knickman, and Andrew Weaver.\n\nSince retiring from cycling, Phinney has remained active as a cycling sports commentator, public speaker, journalist, and avid Nordic ski racer.\n\nHe is married to champion cyclist Connie Carpenter-Phinney, with whom he has two children, Taylor and Kelsey. On Thursday, August 9, 2007, Taylor became the Junior World Time Trial champion at the 2007 UCI Junior World Road and Track Championships held in Aguascalientes, Mexico, and on September 29, 2010, he became the 2010 UCI Under 23 World Time Trial champion.\n\nPhinney was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease at age 40, and established the Davis Phinney Foundation in 2004, a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. As Taylor was about to go to the Beijing Olympics late in 2008, Davis underwent deep brain stimulation in an effort to control some of his symptoms. Jaimie Henderson, a neurosurgeon at Stanford University Medical Center, implanted two electrodes 2.5 inches into either side of Phinney's brain, powered by a pacemaker in his chest. According to ESPN, the procedure was risky and not promising, but worked instantly. Phinney explained:\n\nThe doctor said, 'OK, let's try a little current now, and just like that, all these muscles that had been at war with each other suddenly were at peace. It was like Armistice Day. It was just like, 'Oh … my … god!' I looked at my wife and she was crying. She said, 'I haven't seen your smile in a year!'\n\nBy 2012, the disease was setting in again. Doctors told him the brain pacemaker could turn the clock back on the progress of Parkinson's five years.

{"id": "2012889", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2012889", "title": "Shanti Bahini", "text": "Shanti Bahini\n\nThe Shanti Bahini (; meaning \"Peace Force\") was the armed wing of the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samhati Samiti (United People's Party of the Chittagong Hill Tracts) in Bangladesh. It is considerend an insurgent group in Bangladesh. The Shanti Bahini was made out of mostly members from the Chakma tribe.\n\nFollowing the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, Manabendra Narayan Larma founded the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samhati Samiti (PCJSS) on 15 February 1972, seeking to build an organization representing all the tribal peoples of the Chittagong Hill Tracts. Larma was elected to the Bangladesh Jatiya Sangsad, the national legislature of Bangladesh as a candidate of the PCJSS in 1973. When Larma's continued efforts to make the government recognize the rights of the tribal peoples through political discussions had failed, Larma and the PCJSS began organizing the Shanti Bahini (Peace Corps), an armed force operating in the Hill Tracts area. It was formed in 1972 and fought for many years against the government.\nShanti Bahini began attacking Bangladesh Army convoys in 1977. They carried out kidnappings and extortion. Larma subsequently went into hiding from government security forces. Factionalism within the PCJS weakened Larma's standing and he was assassinated on 10 November 1983. On 23 June 1981 the Shanti Bahini attacked a camp of Bangladesh rifles, killing 13 people. They later captured and executed 24 members of the Bangladesh rifles. In the 1980s the Government of Bangladesh started to provide land for thousands of landless Bengali . Many Bengali were forced to move to secure regions because of the insurgency, abandoning their land to the tribal communities. On 29 April 1986, Shanti Bahini massacred 19 Bengali. On 26 June 1989 the Shanti Bahini burned down villages where inhabitants had voted in Bangladeshi elections. In 1996 Shanti Bahini abducted and killed 30 Bengali. On 9 September 1996, the Shanti Bahini massacred a group of Bengali woodcutters, who were under the impression they'd been called to a meeting. Members of Shanti Bahini extorted some four million dollars from the local population in the name of toll collection.\n\nThe Shanti Bahini abandoned militancy when the Bangladesh Awami League negotiated the Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord between the government and the PCJSS on 2 December 1997. Members of Shanti Bahini surrendered their weapons in a stadium in Khagrachari. The treaty saw the lifting of nighttime curfew and the return of 50 thousand refugees. However, some members opposed to the peace deal formed a dissident group. Some of those who opposed the peace treaty formed the United People's Democratic Front as an alternate to the PCJSS. The treaty was also criticised by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and has not been fully implemented. Some members of Shanti Bahini became police officers after the peace treaty. On August 2014 Indian Border Security Forces arrested members of Shanti Bahini, two Bangladeshi Chakmas and three Indian national Chakmas with weapons in Mizoram.\n\nThe spokesman for the Shanti Bahini, Bimal Chakma alleged Indian involvement by stating that after the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the removal of Bangladesh Awami League from power in 1975, India provided support and shelter to the members of Shanti Bahini. Members of Shanti Bahini were trained in Chakrata, India.\n\n"}
{"id": "2012894", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2012894", "title": "Zaleplon", "text": "Zaleplon\n\nZaleplon, sold under the brand names Sonata among others, is a sedative-hypnotic, used to treat insomnia. It is a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic from the pyrazolopyrimidine class.\n\nIt is manufactured by King Pharmaceuticals and Gedeon Richter Plc.. It has been discontinued in Canada but can be manufactured if a prescription is brought to a compounding pharmacy. It is prescribed rarely in the United Kingdom, with zopiclone being the preferred Z-drug by the National Health Service (NHS).\n\nZaleplon is slightly effective in insomnia, primarily characterized by difficulty falling asleep. Due to its ultrashort elimination half-life, zaleplon may not be effective in reducing premature awakenings.\n\nIt may result in an impaired ability to drive the next day, though it has proven promising when compared to other sedative/hypnotics and next-day residual sedation. It may have advantages over benzodiazepines with fewer adverse effects.\n\nNeither zaleplon, nor any nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic class medication should be combined with alcohol, as both modulate GABA receptor sites, and in a synergistic manner increase the chances of fatal respiratory depression and asphyxiation from vomiting.\n\nZaleplon is not recommended for chronic use in the elderly. The elderly are more sensitive to the adverse effects of zaleplon such as cognitive side effects. Zaleplon may increase the risk of injury among the elderly. It should not be used while in pregnancy or lactation, and in patients with a history of alcohol or drug abuse, psychotic illness or depression, clinicians should devote more attention.\n\nWhen compared with benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepines (including zaleplon) offer few significant advantages in efficacy and tolerability among elderly individuals. Long-term use of sedative/hypnotics for insomnia has traditionally been discouraged for reasons that include concerns about addiction and rebound insomnia, as well to the risk of side effects associated to GABA agonists, such as cognitive impairment, anterograde amnesia, daytime sedation, musculoskeletal impairment, and subsequently an increased risk of harm to oneself (e.g. falling) and to others (e.g. automotive accidents). Though, quite obviously as the body and brain age, these aforementioned phenomena are expected events, as they occur daily regardless of ingestion of a sedative/hypnotic. Thus, statistically significant and empirical evidence are arguably still absent as dramatic precautions and conclusions are drawn irrespective of the debilitating realities that accompany insomnia and the fact that these medicines do indeed provide assistance to millions of elderly individuals. It is important to distinguish between the extrapolation of potential side effects relative to the vast number of examples, wherein the sedative/hypnotic has proven therapeutically beneficial and appropriate.\n\nIn addition, some contend the efficacy and safety of long-term use of these agents remains to be enumerated, but nothing concrete suggests long-term use poses any direct harm to a person. Still, as of today neither benzodiazepines nor nonbenzodiazepines are recommended for the long-term treatment of insomnia.\n\nThe adverse effects of zaleplon are similar to the adverse effects of benzodiazepines, although with less next-day sedation, and in two studies zaleplon use was found not to cause an increase in traffic accidents, as compared to other hypnotics currently on the market.\n\nSleeping pills, including zaleplon, have been associated with an increased risk of death.\n\nAvailable data cannot provide a reliable estimate of the incidence of dependence during treatment at recommended doses of zaleplon (typically 5–20 mg before bed). Other sedative/hypnotics have been associated with various signs and symptoms of a withdrawal syndrome, following abrupt discontinuation, ranging from mild dysphoria and insomnia to more serious cases that include abdominal and muscle cramps, vomiting, sweating, tremors, and convulsions. Following abrupt cessation, the seizure threshold is further lowered, wherein coma and death are possible outcomes if untreated.\n\nSome evidence suggests zaleplon is not as chemically reinforcing and exhibits far fewer rebound effects when compared with other nonbenzodiazepines, or Z-drugs.\n\nCimetidine, rifampicin, and thioridazine cause interactions with zaleplon.\n\nCimetidine and grapefruit are known to increase blood plasma concentrations of benzodiazepines metabolized by the P450 CYP3A4 liver enzyme (e.g. alprazolam) by extending the time by which the drug leaves the body, effectively extending the half-life and enhancing effects to potentially toxic levels. Thus, given the similarities between zaleplon and benzodiazepines, particularly in effect, and not just chemical structure, it is reasonable to take precautions (e.g. inquire at a pharmacy) before one consumes cimetidine (or grapefruit) while also taking zaleplon.\n\nZaleplon is a high-affinity ligand of positive modulator sites of GABA receptors, which enhances GABAergic inhibition of neurotransmission in the central nervous system. The ultrashort half-life gives zaleplon a unique advantage over other hypnotics because of its lack of next-day residual effects on driving and other performance-related skills. Unlike nonselective benzodiazepine drugs and zopiclone, which distort the sleep pattern, zaleplon appears to induce sleep without disrupting the natural sleep architecture.\n\nA meta-analysis of randomized, controlled clinical trials which compared benzodiazepines against zaleplon or other Z-drugs such as zolpidem, zopiclone, and eszopiclone has found few clear and consistent differences between zaleplon and the benzodiazepines in terms of sleep onset latency, total sleep duration, number of awakenings, quality of sleep, adverse events, tolerance, rebound insomnia, and daytime alertness.\n\nZaleplon has a pharmacological profile similar to benzodiazepines, characterized by an increase in slow wave deep sleep (SWDS) with rapid onset of hypnotic action. Zaleplon is a full agonist for the benzodiazepine α receptor located on the GABA receptor complex in the body, with lower affinity for the α and α subsites. It selectively enhances the action of GABA similar to, but more selectively than benzodiazepines. Zaleplon, although not a benzodiazepine, maintains a very similar pharmacological profile nonetheless, known for inducing hypnotic effects by α subreceptor sites, anxiolytic and muscle relaxant effects via α and α subsites, with negligible anticonvulsant properties (via α subsite), as zaleplon action is modulated at benzodiazepine receptor sites. The elimination half-life of zaleplon is about 1–1.5 hours. The absorption rate of zaleplon is rapid and the onset of therapeutic effects is typically breached within 5–15 minutes following ingestion.\n\nZaleplon should be understood as an ultrashort-acting sedative-hypnotic drug for the treatment of insomnia. Zaleplon increases EEG power density in the δ-frequency band and a decrease in the energy of the θ-frequency band\n\nZaleplon is primarily metabolised by aldehyde oxidase, and its half-life can be affected by substances which inhibit or induce aldehyde oxidase. Taken orally, zaleplon reaches full concentration in about one hour. It is extensively metabolised into 5-oxozaleplon and 5-oxodesethylzaleplon (the latter via desethylzaleplon), with less than 1% of it excreted intact in urine.\n\nPure zaleplon in its solid state is a white to off-white powder with very low solubility in water, as well as low solubility in ethanol and propylene glycol. It has a constant octanol-water partition coefficient of log P = 1.23 in the pH range between 1 and 7.\n\nIt is classified as a pyrazolopyrimidine.\n\nThe synthesis starts with the condensation of 3-acetylacetanilide (1) with \"N\",\"N\"-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal (DMFDMA) to give the eneamide (2). The anilide nitrogen is then alkylated by means of sodium hydride and ethyl iodide to give 3. The first step in the condensation with 3-amino-4-cyanopyrazole can be visualized as involving an addition-elimination reaction sequence on the eneamide function to give a transient intermediate such as 5. Cyclization then leads to formation of the fused pyrimidine ring to afford zaleplon (6).\n\nZaleplon has the potential to be a drug of recreational use, and has been found to have an addictive potential similar to benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine-like hypnotics. The mind- and judgment-altering effects of zaleplon are similar to those of many benzodiazepines, but the fast-acting nature and short half-life of the chemical mean high doses set on much more quickly and last for short periods of time (usually from 45 to 60 minutes).\n\nSome individuals use a different delivery method than prescribed, such as insufflation, to induce effects faster. \n\nA common effect of recreational zaleplon use is the occurrence of (typically short-lived) hallucinations. Fewer visual and auditory hallucinations/disruptions occur with the use of zaleplon than with other Z-drugs, like zolpidem. Anterograde amnesia can occur and can cause one to lose track of the amount of zaleplon already ingested, prompting the ingesting of more than originally planned. However, continuous ingestion is extremely unlikely precisely because of zaleplon's quick onset of action.\n\nThe combination of alcohol and zaleplon can result in fatal respiratory depression and asphyxiation from vomiting.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration allows zaleplon with a 6-hour wait period and no more than twice a week, which makes it the sleep medication with the shortest allowed waiting period after use. The substances with the 2nd shortest period, which is of 24 hours, are zolpidem and ramelteon.\n\nThe United States Air Force uses zaleplon as one of the hypnotics approved as a \"no-go pill\" to help aviators and special-duty personnel sleep in support of mission readiness (with a four-hour restriction on subsequent flight operation). \"Ground tests\" are required prior to authorization being issued to use the medication in an operational situation. The other hypnotics used as \"no-go pills\" are temazepam and zolpidem, which both have longer mandatory recovery periods.\n"}

Since its inception in 1972, the PCJSS has fought for autonomy and the recognition of the ethnic identity and rights of the indigenous tribes of the Hill Tracts. Its military arm, the Shanti Bahini was used to fight government forces and Bengali settlers in the Hill Tracts. A peace accord was signed in 1997 led to the disarmament of the Shanti Bahini and enabled the PCJSS to return to mainstream politics.\n\nThe roots of the PCJSS can be traced to the Hill Tracts Students' Association and the Parbatya Chattagram Upajatiya Kalyan Samiti (United People's Welfare and Development Party of the Chittagong Hill Tracts) that were organised in the 1960s in what was then-East Pakistan. The organisations agitated on behalf of the 100,000 native peoples displaced by the construction of the Kaptai Dam, seeking rehabilitation and compensation. After the creation of Bangladesh in 1971, representatives of the Chittagong Hill Tracts such as the Chakma politicians Charu Bikash Chakma and Manabendra Narayan Larma sought autonomy and recognition of the rights of the peoples of the region. Larma and others protested the draft of the Constitution of Bangladesh, although the Constitution recognised the ethnic identity but Larma and others wanted full sovereignty and separation from Bangladesh. The government policy of recognised only the Bengali culture and the Bengali language and designating all citizens of Bangladesh as Bengalis. In talks with Hill Tracts delegation led by Manabendra Narayan Larma, the country's founding leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman insisted that the ethnic groups of the Hill Tracts adopt the Bengali identity. Sheikh Mujib is also reported to have threatened to forcibly settle Bengalis in the Hill Tracts to reduce the native peoples into a minority.\n\nOn 24 April 1972 Manabendra Narayan Larma presented a four-point manifesto to the constitution drafting committee, which sought:\n\n\nThe manifesto was summarily rejected by the government, causing resentment and dissatisfaction amongst the people of the Hill Tracts. On 15 February 1973 representatives and activists of the Hill Tracts founded the Parbatya Chhattagram Jana Samhatti Samiti (PCJSS) under Manabendra Narayan Larma's leadership. The party's official aims and objectives included humanism, nationalism, democracy, secularism and the protection of the rights, culture and ethnic identity, and autonomy for the tribes of the Hill Tracts. The PCJSS sought to unify and represent all the tribes of the Hill Tracts and also organised a committee of villages, a students and youth wing and a women's wing of the party.\n\nDissatisfaction and anger due to government opposition to their demands led the PCJSS to organise the Shanti Bahini (Peace forces) as military force to launch an armed struggle to win autonomy and secure the rights of the people of the Hill Tracts. Many insurgents are believed to have trained, equipped and sheltered in the neighbouring Indian state of Tripura. During the insurgency, the PCJSS strongly opposed the government-driven settlement of Bengalis in the Hill Tracts as a ploy to marginalise the tribes in their home region. The PCJSS also rejected the Chittagong Hill Tracts Development Board and other government plans for local councils. After an insurgency that lasted for almost two decades, the PCJSS entered into peace talks with the government after the restoration of democracy in 1991. However, little progress was made with the government of prime minister Begum Khaleda Zia, the widow of Ziaur Rahman and her Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Fresh rounds of talks began in 1996 with the newly elected prime minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed of the Awami League, the daughter of Sheikh Mujib. The peace accord was finalised and formally signed on 2 December 1997. The peace accord provided for greater autonomy, the return of land to displaced tribals and special status for the ethnic groups and tribes. The accord also created a central ministry of tribal affairs and an elected regional council that would be empowered to govern the Hill Tracts and oversee local tribal councils. The accord also granted official recognition of the ethnic groups and tribes.\n\nAfter the treaty was signed, Shanti Bahini insurgents formally laid down their arms and more than 50,000 displaced tribals were able to return to their homes. The PCJSS emerged as a mainstream political party.\n\nSince the peace accord, the PCJSS has emerged as a mainstream political party and is currently headed by Jyotirindra Bodhipriya Larma, the younger brother of Manabendra Narayan Larma, who is also the chairman of the CHT regional council. The PCJSS has continued to agitate for the full and proper implementation of the peace accord and has alleged lack of government action and intimidation from security forces. The PCJSS has protested the rise of Islamism and Islamic terrorism in the region from groups based in Bangladesh and neighbouring Burma.\n\n\n"}

When he lost his second World Championship in the finals, the headlines rang out \"The World's greatest badminton player may never be World Champion.\" While this may be the enduring footnote to his career, Frost dominated at the much coveted All England Open Badminton Championships. He won that tournament in 1982, 1984, 1986, and 1987. He also was European champion in 1984 and 1986. He won the Nordic championship each year from 1978 through 1984 and again in 1988.\n\nFrost is also distinguished by winning all of the invitational Grand Prix tournaments at least once, including his home country's Denmark Open, of which he was champion 1980-1986 and 1989. Morten Frost represented Denmark on the national team from 1976 to 1991, longer than anyone else.\n\nNoted for his exceptionally smooth and fluid footwork, Frost's playing style was something of a cross between the traditional singles game featuring numerous clears (lobs) and drops, with smashes often reserved for weak returns, and the modern singles game featuring more smashing from the outset of a rally to create openings.\n\nMorten Frost was inducted into the BWF Badminton Hall of Fame in 1998.\n\nAfter his playing years were over, he went on to successfully coach the Danish national team. During his tenure as coach, the Danish national squad achieved over 20 major international wins, including an Olympic gold medal in 1996, six gold medals and three silver medals at the European Championships in 1996, the men's singles titles at the 1995 and 1996 All England Championships, and a gold, two silver and four bronze medals at the World Championships in 1995.

The apportionment of seats in the House was based on the 2000 U.S. Census.\n\nThe Democratic Party controlled a majority in both chambers for the first time since the end of the 103rd Congress in 1995. Although the Democrats held fewer than 50 Senate seats, they had an operational majority because the two independent senators caucused with the Democrats for organizational purposes.

{"id": "2012953", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2012953", "title": "Mainbocher", "text": "Mainbocher\n\nMainbocher is a fashion label founded by the American couturier Main Rousseau Bocher (October 24, 1890 – December 27, 1976), also known as Mainbocher (pronounced \"Maine-Bocker\"). Established in 1929, the house of Mainbocher successfully operated in Paris (1929–1939), and then in New York (1940–1971).\n\nIn November 1929, Main Rousseau Bocher merged his own name, in honor of his favorite couturieres, Augustabernard and Louiseboulanger, and established his own fashion house, incorporated as \"Mainbocher Couture,\" at 12 Avenue George-V in Paris. Mainbocher progressively gained recognition for his elegant and sophisticated couture garments. The strapless dress and jeweled cashmere sweaters are his creations.\n\nHis subtle and timeless style won Mainbocher an exclusive clientele, which included fashion editors like Carmel Snow, Bettina Ballard, Diana Vreeland, aristocrats like Princess Karam of Kapurthala, Elsie de Wolfe, Lady Castlerosse, the Vicomtesse de Noailles, Baroness Eugène de Rothschild, pianist Dame Myra Hess, socialites like Millicent Rogers, Daisy Fellowes, Mrs. Cole Porter, Syrie Maugham, and stars like Mary Pickford, Constance Bennett, Kay Francis, Claudette Colbert, Irene Dunne, Loretta Young, Miriam Hopkins, Helen Hayes.\n\nHis most famous patron was Wallis Simpson, after whom he even named a color, \"Wallis Blue.\" In 1937, he also designed her wedding dress and trousseau for her marriage to the Duke of Windsor, after he abdicated the British throne. Described in 1950 as \"one of the most photographed and most copied dresses of modern times,\" the bridal dress is today part of the Metropolitan Museum collection. Hamish Bowles later said: \"I think [Mainbocher's clothes] are so subtle, the detailing is so extraordinary, and they are so unbelievably evocative of ... absolute subtle luxury. You can really see why a client like Wallis Windsor would have been drawn to his clothes, and why she became so emblematic of his work.\"\n\nMainbocher's last Paris collections created a storm of controversy. Anticipating Christian Dior's \"New Look\" by eight years, the \"wasp waist,\" a nipped-in waist, radically altered the silhouette of the thirties. Dior himself confessed: \"Mainbocher is really in advance of us all, because he does it in America.\" The corset that shaped Mainbocher's last Parisian collection was immortalized in 1939 by one of Horst P. Horst's most famous photographs, known as the \"Mainbocher Corset.\" Mainbocher's corseted waist, defined bosom, and back draping was an abrupt shift in silhouette and introduced the Victorian motifs that were to pervade the forties. In his book \"Decades: A Century of Fashion\" in which he named Mainbocher \"the designer of the 30ies\", Cameron Silver further noted that \"Mainbocher's designs oozed exclusivity, good breeding, and rarefied taste\".\n\nThe onset of Second World War forced Mainbocher to leave France. In 1940, he relocated his business to New York on 57th Street next to Tiffany's and established \"Mainbocher Inc.\" He recreated his Paris salons exactly as they were and stayed to true to haute couture traditions.\n\nThe corset controversy proved to be a timely marketing opportunity; the house of Mainbocher teamed up with the Warner Brothers Corset Company and streamlined the design for mass production. He showed his first New York collection on October 30, 1940, and soon established himself as one of the leading American fashion designers. He solved fabric rationing issues by designing short evening gowns and \"cocktail aprons\" that could transform any dress into a formal evening dress.\n\nDuring the war, Mainbocher designed a series of uniforms for both military and civilian organizations, thus applying his principles of functionality and utility, while retaining the sophisticated elegance of his namesake label. These uniforms also allowed him to reclaim his American identity in such a patriotic context. In 1942, he conceived the uniforms for the women only division of the American Navy, called WAVES. He then updated the uniforms of the American Red Cross, and in 1948, he unified the uniforms of Girl Scouts in the same shade of green. In 1950, he designed a one of a kind evening dress uniform for Colonel Katherine Amelia Towle, who was then Director of Women Marines (USMCR). This unique uniform is now on display at the armory of the Newport Artillery Company in Newport, Rhode Island.\n\nIn New York, Mainbocher continued to dress generations of women like debutante Brenda Frazier, Doris Duke, Adele Astaire, Elizabeth Parke Firestone, Gloria Vanderbilt, Lila Wallace, Bunny Mellon, Babe Paley, Princess Maria Cristina de Bourbon, Kathryn Miller, and C. Z. Guest. In 1947, eight of the New York Dress Institute's Ten Best-Dressed Women in the World were Mainbocher clients.\n\nAfter he achieved fame for dressing some of the world's most famous women, Mainbocher was commissioned to design the costumes for Leonora Corbett in the comic play \"Blithe Spirit\" (1941), for Mary Martin in the Broadway musicals \"One Touch of Venus\" (1943) and \"The Sound of Music\" (1959), for Tallulah Bankhead in the Broadway production \"Private Lives\" (1948), for Ethel Merman in the musical \"Call Me Madam\" (1950), for Rosalind Russell in the musical \"Wonderful Town\" (1953), for Lynn Fontanne in \"The Great Sebastians\" (1956), for Katharine Cornell in \"The Prescott Papers\", for Irene Worth in the play \"Tiny Alice\" (1964), and for Lauren Bacall in the musical \"Applause\" (1970).\n\nIn 1961, Mainbocher business moved to the K.L.M. Building on Fifth Avenue and continued until 1971 when Mainbocher, at the age of 81, closed the doors of his house. He spent his last years between Paris and Munich until his death in 1976.\n\nIn 2002, Mainbocher was honored with a bronze plaque on New York City's Fashion Walk of Fame in the legendary Garment District.\n\nMainbocher inspired many of the most brilliant fashion designers, including Christian Lacroix, who praised the glamour of his garments.\n\nMainbocher's fashion designs have been displayed in many exhibitions over the years. In 2010, the Museum of the City of New York created a virtual exhibition on \"Worth & Mainbocher\", which was the first to emphasize Mainbocher's work.\n\nThe first retrospective dedicated to Mainbocher, entitled \"Making Mainbocher\", took place at the Chicago History Museum from October 2016 to August 2017. This exhibition was partly sponsored by Luvanis, which is the current owner of the brand.\n\n\n\n"}

He later opened three more OBI nightclubs and named them according to their geographic location. The OBI North was in Smithtown, New York, the 'OBI East' near the Shinnecock Canal en route to The Hamptons, and the OBI West locations in Island Park, New York (which has 2 locations over time; first at 3999 Long Beach Road, and later, briefly, at 50 Broadway). All four clubs were located on Long Island and were wildly successful for many years, bringing people in from all over Long Island, New York City, Westchester, southern Connecticut and New Jersey and hosting acts such as Twisted Sister and The Good Rats. In 1979, Matherson sued the town to lease him more land for additional parking which the town granted. However two years later, new officials disagreed which caused Matherson to sue again and when the court favored with Matherson, the town granted him $3 million and the nine acres. In 1993, an unhappy Matherson actually started a \"Move Out of New York Before It's Too Late\" campaign complete with a hearse, banners and TV ads. A 1993 \"New York Times\" article provided more details about his campaign including that the New York State Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control raided the club one year earlier in 1992. One of the OBI West locations burned down after only a couple of years of packing in thousands on the weekends. Arson involving organized crime figures referred to in the movie \"Goodfellas\" was alleged but never substantiated.\n\nOver the years, the OBI was involved in many disputes with the local community over issues such as noise, parking and traffic. Finally, in 1999, Matherson sold the property to developer Ross Cassata, who planned to build condominiums, and moved to Key West, Florida to open a new club of the same name. When it closed, the inn's two-ton statues of whales and dolphins, which were commonly touched by clubgoers, were moved to Danfords on the Sound in Long Island. However, Cassata then sold the nine acres to Suffolk County for $7.95 million and the original property was torn down in 2003 and was replaced with a town-operated park, with later added plans of adding a bed and breakfast, upscale restaurant, boardwalk, water-sport area and boat ramp. The park now hosts activities such as car racing and has caused controversy in itself. At the time of demolition, the Suffolk County Legislator commented that the park agreement avoided \"an enormous tax increase in Babylon, which would have had to pay a court judgment of as much as $20 million or watch its coastline be forever scarred by high-rise development\" and the money came from the county's greenway program.\n\nThe original \"OBI\" was at 1 Oak Beach Road, Oak Beach, NY. The building was sold in 1999, torn down in 2003, land turned into a park with a small beach simply called \"Oak Beach\".\n\nThe \"OBI East\" was at 239 E Montauk Highway, Hampton Bays, NY. The building is in ruins but is still standing.\n\nThe \"OBI North\" was at State Road 25A, near Jericho Turnpike, Smithtown, NY. The building burned down in 1980, the land is now part of \"Willow Ridge at Smithtown\" HOA.\n\nThe \"OBI West\" was at 3999 Long Beach Road, Island Park, NY. The building was torn down between 1994 and 2004, the land is now a school bus parking lot.\nIt later was briefly located at 50 Broadway (sometimes listed as 50 Austin Blvd.), Island Park, NY as one of a series of famous nightclubs such as the \"Shell House\", \"The Action House\", \"The Rock Pile\", \"OBI West\", and \"Speaks\".\n\nRobert Matherson later went on to open \"Oak Beach Inn\" at 227 Duval Street, Key West, Florida. That establishment was only operating for a few years. Robert Matherson died in 2007.\n\nRobert \"Rosebud\" Butt is credited with inventing the Long Island Iced Tea, while working as a bartender at the original OBI in the 1970s.\n\nIn 2010 the Babylon-based rock band \"Two Cent Sam\" released the \"OBI Song\" and a DIY video celebrating the Oak Beach Inn's history and impact on Long Islanders and the void in Long Island night life after the \"OBI's\" destruction \n"}

In 2012, it transported 17,000 passengers daily, 60 to 70% of whom were airport staff.\n\nThe original proposal for an automated people mover system at Pearson Airport was submitted in May 2002. Six months later, on November 15, 2002, a $55-million contract was signed with DCC Doppelmayr Cable Car GmbH of Wolfurt, Austria, followed by four years of construction, and the system opened to the public on July 6, 2006. The new service initially operated alongside its predecessor, the Link shuttle bus system.\n\nThe system cost $150 million.\n\nThe Link Train uses a pair of Cable Liner trains. They use a cable-hauled, drive and tension system. Each train has capacity for 175 passengers with baggage (25 per car: 17 standing, 8 seated) or 2,500 passengers per hour per direction (pphpd).\n\n\nThe two trains, plus a small work car, cost a total of when delivered. They were refurbished in 2013, and received a new paint scheme, new seats, and a seventh car (they were originally delivered and used as six-car trains).\n\nThe two fully elevated lines, running side-by-side, are long, and have a travel time of four minutes one way. They serve a total of three stations:\n\nBoth lines operate independently in shuttle mode with a total capacity of up to 2,180 pphpd. The trains run on rubber tires on a smooth steel surface and all propulsion is provided by the cable. The absence of onboard motors, braking systems and gearboxes eliminates excessive noise, oil spills from the trains, and dust from brakes. Doppelmayr asserts that a cable-driven APM is the most environmentally responsible solution for transportation in high density applications.\nOn March 30, 2009, the Link Train was put out of service for extensive maintenance due to engineering design flaws. During this time, service was replaced by an inter-terminal shuttle bus contracted to Penetang-Midland Coach Lines. Normal service resumed in July 2009.\n\nOn March 16, 2013, the Link Train was shut down for approximately eight months during construction of the Union Pearson Express. The trains were refurbished during this time and received a seventh car, new seats, and a new paint scheme.\n\nThe Union Pearson Express airport rail link service between Pearson Airport and Union Station in Downtown Toronto opened on June 6, 2015, in time for the 2015 Pan American Games. It directly serves Terminal 1, with a connection to Terminal 3 via the Link Train.\n\nA number of public transport bus services in the GTA have a stop on the lower level of Terminal 1; these include the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC), MiWay, Brampton Transit, and GO Transit. The TTC has an additional stop on the lower level at Terminal 3, served after departing Terminal 1.\n\nAs originally proposed, Line 5 Eglinton was to connect Pearson Airport with Scarborough by 2018 as part of the \"Transit City\" plan.\n\n\n"}

It was originally named Athletic Park and opened as Cobb Field on May 4, 1948 after renovations. It was the home of the Billings Mustangs, the Pioneer League Rookie Affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds, from 1948-2007. Cobb Field was named after Bob Cobb, who was responsible for bringing the Mustangs to Billings. It also hosted home games for local American Legion baseball teams. In 2006, the stadium welcomed the re-formed NCAA baseball team from nearby Montana State University Billings. From March to May, home games were played at the field.\n\nCobb Field had a natural grass surface. The dimensions were 335 feet to left, 405 feet to center, and 325 feet to right. Cobb Field sat 4,200, though crowds had been known to eclipse 5,000. The stadium was primarily made up of the same wood used when it had been built and had shown substantial wear. Many areas of the stadium had needed wooden boards to be installed over holes in the floor. \n\nCobb Field's concessions had undergone a drastic overhaul in its last few years. In addition to the basic concession items, the Mustangs added the \"Cobb Grill\" and \"Betisse's Bullpen\", a patio on the left field line where Mustangs fans can enjoy a beer and roam about freely. \"Betisse's Bullpen\" also hosted pre-game tailgate parties.\n\nProducers Craig Lindvahl and Joseph Fatheree created a film about the ballpark entitled \"Cobb Field, A Day at the Ballpark\". The film gives a view of the world of minor league baseball from the eyes of the ballpark. It was shot during the final weeks of Cobb Field's existence. The film won Mid-America Emmys in three categories: Promotional Video, Musical Composition, and Photography. Lindvahl and Fatheree teach a film class at Effingham High School in Effingham, IL. Some of their students helped in the filming of the movie. Three of these students helped in the filming of Cobb Field and also won Mid-America Emmys for their film work.\n\nOn November 8, 2006, a $12.5 million stadium levy passed (with a 53% majority 'for' vote) allowing construction of a new stadium at the Cobb Field location. Construction began in the Spring of 2007 and Cobb Field was torn down after the 2007 season. The new stadium opened as Dehler Park on June 29, 2008.\n\n"}

For a function formula_4, the exact or total derivative with respect to formula_5 is given by\n\nThe function formula_7 given by\n\nis a potential function for the differential equation\n\nIn physical applications the functions \"I\" and \"J\" are usually not only continuous but even continuously differentiable. Schwarz's Theorem then provides us with a necessary criterion for the existence of a potential function. For differential equations defined on simply connected sets the criterion is even sufficient and we get the following theorem:\n\nGiven a differential equation of the form (for example, when F has zero slope in the x and y direction at F(x,y) ):\nwith \"I\" and \"J\" continuously differentiable on a simply connected and open subset \"D\" of R then a potential function \"F\" exists if and only if\n\nGiven an exact differential equation defined on some simply connected and open subset \"D\" of R with potential function \"F\", a differentiable function \"f\" with (x, \"f\"(\"x\")) in \"D\" is a solution if and only if there exists real number \"c\" so that\n\nFor an initial value problem\nwe can locally find a potential function by\n\nSolving\nfor \"y\", where \"c\" is a real number, we can then construct all solutions.\n\nThe concept of exact differential equations can be extended to second order equations. Consider starting with the first-order exact equation:formula_16Since both functions formula_17 are functions of two variables, implicitly differentiating the multivariate function yieldsformula_18Expanding the total derivatives gives thatformula_19and thatformula_20Combining the formula_21 terms gives formula_22If the equation is exact, then formula_23 . Additionally, the total derivative of formula_24 is equal to its implicit ordinary derivative formula_25. This leads to the rewritten equation formula_26 Now, let there be some second-order differential equationformula_27If formula_23 for exact differential equations, then formula_29andformula_30 where formula_31 is some arbitrary function only of formula_32 that was differentiated away to zero upon taking the partial derivative of formula_33 with respect to formula_34. Although the sign on formula_31 could be positive, it is more intuitive to think of the integral's result as formula_33 that is missing some original extra function formula_31 that was partially differentiated to zero. \n\nNext, ifformula_19then the term formula_39 should be a function only of formula_40 and formula_34, since partial differentiation with respect to formula_40 will hold formula_34 constant and not produce any derivatives of formula_34. In the second order equationformula_27only the term formula_46 is a term purely of formula_32 and formula_34. Let formula_49. If formula_49, then formula_51Since the total derivative of formula_33 with respect to formula_40 is equivalent to the implicit ordinary derivative formula_54 , then formula_55So,formula_56and formula_57Thus, the second order differential equation formula_27is exact only if formula_59 and only if the below expression formula_60is a function solely of formula_40. Once formula_31 is calculated with its arbitrary constant, it is added to formula_63to make formula_64. If the equation is exact, then we can reduce to the first order exact form which is solvable by the usual method for first-order exact equations.formula_16Now, however, in the final implicit solution there will be a formula_66 term from integration of formula_67 with respect to formula_68 twice as well as a formula_69, two arbitrary constants as expected from a second-order equation. \n\nGiven the differential equationformula_70one can always easily check for exactness by examining the formula_71 term. In this case, both the partial and total derivative of formula_72 with respect to formula_68 are formula_74, so their sum is formula_75, which is exactly the term in front of formula_76. With one of the conditions for exactness met, one can calculate that formula_77Letting formula_78, then formula_79So, formula_31 is indeed a function only of formula_32 and the second order differential equation is exact. Therefore, formula_82 and formula_83. Reduction to a first-order exact equation yieldsformula_84Integrating formula_33 with respect to formula_32 yields formula_87where formula_88 is some arbitrary function of formula_34. Differentiating with respect to formula_34 gives an equation correlating the derivative and the formula_91 term.formula_92 So, formula_93 and the full implicit solution becomesformula_94Solving explicitly for formula_34 yields\n\nformula_96\nThe concepts of exact differential equations can be extended to any order. Starting with the exact second order equation\n\nformula_97it was previously shown that equation is defined such that\n\nformula_98Implicit differentiation of the exact second-order equation formula_99 times will yield an formula_100th order differential equation with new conditions for exactness that can be readily deduced from the form of the equation produced. For example, differentiating the above second-order differential equation once to yield a third-order exact equation gives the following form\n\nformula_101\n\nwhere\n\nformula_102and where formula_103is a function only of formula_104 and formula_21. Combining all formula_21 and formula_107 terms not coming from formula_103 gives\n\nformula_109Thus, the three conditions for exactness for a third-order differential equation are: the formula_107 term must be formula_111, the formula_21 term must be formula_113 and \n\nformula_114must be a function solely of formula_68. \n\nConsider the nonlinear third-order differential equationformula_116If formula_117, then formula_118 is formula_119 and formula_120which together sum to formula_121. Fortunately, this appears in our equation. For the last condition of exactness,\n\nformula_122which is indeed a function only of formula_68. So, the differential equation is exact. Integrating twice yields that formula_124. Rewriting the equation as a first-order exact differential equation yields\n\nformula_125Integrating formula_64 with respect to formula_68 gives that formula_128. Differentiating with respect to formula_129 and equating that to the term in front of formula_76 in the first-order equation gives that\n\nformula_131 and that formula_132.

{"id": "2013009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2013009", "title": "Spud (game)", "text": "Spud (game)\n\nSpud is a game for children and adults, where players try to eliminate each other by catching and throwing an inflated and generally softball. It is related to \"call ball\" and \"ball tag\". \n\nAs few as three may play, with no upper limit. A large, open area is required. The game begins with each player being assigned a number, in secret, with the highest number corresponding to the number of players. For example, if 5 people are playing, each player will be assigned one of the numbers 1 through 5. A player is chosen as 'It.' The person who is It stands in the approximate center of the playing area, with one foot in front of the other. All of the other players must then touch one of their feet to its inward foot, and then step backwards 3 paces. This 3-step-backward set-up is required. When all of the players have stepped backward 3 paces, the person who is It throws the ball straight into the air and calls the number of another player. The ball must be thrown straight up. \n\nWhen the ball is thrown skyward, all of the players then dash away until the player whose number is called both (1) gains possession of the ball; and (2) calls out 'Spud!' At that point, all of the players must freeze. If, while they were running, they were unable to stop immediately, those players must retrace their steps and return to the point that they were in contact with when Spud! was called. In no event may any of the players run around corners or hide behind trees. In all instances, they must be in sight of the player who has gained possession of the ball. At this point, the player who has the ball is allowed to take an identified number of giant steps toward one or more of the other players. Smaller, younger, or older players may be given the option of taking more steps. After the steps are taken, the person with the ball will try to hit one of the other players with the ball. The target player may not move his or her feet or duck, but may sway, bend, shimmy, and shift. \n\nIf the target player comes into contact with the thrown ball in any way (unless he or she catches the ball), he or she is penalized with one letter (i.e., S P U or D), and then is charged with throwing the ball into the air for the next round. If the target player does not come into contact with the thrown ball or the target player catches the ball, the player who threw the ball is penalized with one letter, and then is charged with throwing the ball into the air for the next round. \n\nWhen a player receives four penalty letters (S P U D), that person is required to go through a spanking machine, and a new game is begun. For another variation, a player who receives four Penalty letters is simply removed from the game, and the other players continue playing with their original penalty letters in place. When there are only 2 players left playing under this variation, there are two ways for the game to end. First, both players can be declared victors. Second, one of the removed players throws the ball into the air for the final round.\n\nIn another variation, the highest of the secretly-assigned numbers is 2 greater than the number of players. In this version, the 2 secretly unassigned numbers are referred to as 'ghost numbers.' If the player throwing the ball into the air calls a ghost number, all players will then chase after the ball and try to touch it. The last player to touch the ball is penalized with one letter and is then charged with throwing the ball into the air for the next round. While kicking the ball is permitted, players may not kick the ball if it is within 3 feet of another player (for purposes of safety). In this instance, the player may simply touch or punch the ball with another part of the body besides his or her feet. In this version, when a player is removed, his or her number also becomes a ghost number. In all instances, a player who wants to call a ghost number must throw the ball sufficiently high and in the air to remove any advantage that he or she would otherwise have.\n"}

{"id": "2013014", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2013014", "title": "Oatley railway station", "text": "Oatley railway station\n\nThe Oatley railway station is a heritage-listed railway station located on the Illawarra line, in the Sydney suburb of Oatley in the Georges River Council local government area of New South Wales, Australia. The station is served by Sydney Trains T4 line services. It was designed and built by the NSW Government Railway and from 1905 to 1992. It is also known as the Oatley Railway Station group. The property is owned by RailCorp, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.\n\nOatley is notable as the end point of the first section of track to be electrified for regular passenger services, with services from Central commencing on 1 March 1926. Historically some services used to terminate at Oatley before returning north; this is no longer the case but the points remain in place.\n\nThe Oatley area was named after James Oatley, who was granted in the area, called Needwood Forest, in 1833. Oatley never built on the grant and it passed to his third son after his death in 1839, who sold the land to Charles Cecil Griffiths in 1881. The property extended from Gungal Bay on the western edge to the later Boundary and Hurstville Roads.\n\nIn 1881 the proposed route for the Illawarra railway line was published and approved. In 1882 works began at Marrickville (now Sydenham) on railway construction. In 1884 the railway to Hurstville station opened (double track) with stations at Arncliffe, Rockdale, Kogarah and Hurstville. In 1885 the first single track line (built by C. & E. Miller) was opened as far as Sutherland station, with railway stations opened at Como, Penshurst, Mortdale, and Oatley. The small platform at Oatley, with a timber platform building, opened on 26 December 1885. Judd's Hurstville Brick Works opened in 1884, on a site north of Oatley (now the site of Georges River College). The location of Judd's brick works appears to have been a major reason for the building of Oatley railway station in 1885 in what was then a very sparsely populated area.\n\nThe railway station was first called \"Oatley's Grant\" (up to 1886) and then \"Oatley's Platform\" (by 1889). In 1890 \"Oatley's Platform\" finally changed to \"Oatley\". The line was duplicated in 1890. The Station Master's residence was built in 1891. Development in the area was slow - in 1893 there were only nine houses in the vicinity of the railway station. In 1903 a post office was established at the railway station.\n\nIn July 1905 regrading of the railway line led to the station being moved to the west of its original location, away from the Oatley town centre at Frederick St and Letitia St to the east. This relocation of the line was due to the steep gradient leading down to the Georges River bridge which the goods trains had difficulty climbing. The 1890 weatherboard platform building was relocated to the new station, onto a long curved brick island platform. The platform building is now only one of the two such weatherboard platform buildings of this type in Sydney (the other being at Penshurst railway station). Part of the former railway reservation is now the Oatley Memorial Gardens.\n\nAccess from one side of the line to the other was initially via a series of overbridges at various locations along the line. In some localities these were too far apart, and construction of a series of brick arch subways was begun around 1905 and completed during the 1920s. Construction was in brickwork due to the large number of nearby brickworks. The 1905 brick arched Mulga Road underbridge at Oatley was designed by Per way Branch staff, New South Wales Government Railways. The platform is reached via a subway stair leading off Mulga Road which is part of the underbridge. The underbridge has a semi-circular brick barrel arch spanning over a two-lane roadway, and is thought to be the second largest brick arch underbridge in the NSW rail system. The centre of the bridge is now roofed, between the railway tracks (over the subway) however was unroofed in 1943.\n\nIn 1918 the present signal box was incorporated within the then open north end awning area of the platform building. The electrification of the line from St James to Oatley was undertaken in the 1920s, and the first electric train ran on 16 August 1926. This was the first line to be electrified.\n\nIn December 1930 disused railway land (the former railway alignment to the east) was officially transferred to Kogarah Council, and this became Oatley Memorial Gardens. When first built in 1905, the double track station had an engine road and goods siding on the eastern side but these were closed in 1940.\n\nThe platform building arrangement stayed the same until 1992, when State Rail replanned the remaining part of the platform building, providing new toilet facilities and a larger waiting room at the southern end of the building. This resulted in major change to the platform building both externally and internally (except to the signal box, which remains unaltered), including changes to windows and doors. Also in 1992, a new steel platform canopy was built, connecting the platform building and the entrance to the pedestrian subway.\n\nOn 3 March 2001 a commemorative trip, utilising RailCorp's heritage electric fleet, was made by the Governor Professor Marie Bashir and invited guests to mark the 75th anniversary of the inaugural journey from St James to Oatley in 1926. In 2005 some of the 1992 changes to the platform building were reversed. The 1918 signal box remains in a near original state despite being superseded for electric light signals in 1926.\n\nIn 2015 the Oatley station was upgraded with a 100 vehicle car park, and a pedestrian footbridge with lifts.\n\nThe complex comprises a type 11 platform building, erected in 1905 to replace the original type 4 building erected in 1890; a signal box extension, erected in 1918; the Mulga Road underbridge and pedestrian subway, erected in 1905; an island platform, erected in 1905; a concrete drop-slab location hut, erected in 1920s; platform canopies, erected in 1992; and moveable items, dated from 1918.\n\nThe entry to Oatley Railway Station is via a subway entered from the southern footpath of Mulga Road below the arch of the Mulga Road rail underbridge (road tunnel). There is one island platform, which is curved, has brick edges and asphalt surface. Modern canopies roof the pedestrian subway in the middle of the underbridge, and connect to the platform building.\n\nThe original 1890 building was rebuilt at its current location and altered to an island platform building in 1905. This is a weatherboard island platform building with a 1918 signal box extension at the northern end to protect the original signal levers. There is also a signalling board (not operational). The building has timber posts and brackets to awnings on each side, with timber valances to awning ends. The waiting area has timber panelled double doors, 9-paned timber framed double hung windows with fanlights and sidelights to the waiting area doors on both sides. Doors are modern timber flush. There are timber framed double hung windows at the northern (entry) end of the platform building, in front of which are a modern telephone and modern vending machine. The original ceilings are ripple iron with metal ceiling roses, and original internal walls are also weatherboard. Modern toilets are accessed from within the waiting area (at southern end).\n\nA single large span brick arch structure at 7.32 m clear span, for road access under the line, with semi-circular arches 600 mm thick. The underbridge is unusual in incorporating the pedestrian subway entry to the station, with the subway roof in the middle of the bridge (between the railway tracks). The subway is accessed off the southern footpath of Mulga Road, under the Mulga Road underbridge.\n\nThis is a curved island platform, which has brick faces and an asphalt surface.\n\nThis is a small prefabricated concrete location hut to the southeast of the southern end of the station platform. It has a hipped corrugated steel roof.\n\nA modern platform canopy connects the pedestrian subway entry to the station to the platform building. Another modern platform canopy extends south of the platform building. Both canopies have gabled corrugated steel roofs, steel posts with concrete bases.\n\nThe station has a parkland setting near its entry point, with parks to east and west of the Mulga Road underbridge, adjacent to the northern end of the station.\n\nSignalling equipment within signal box: a signal panel (not operational), signal levers and three early telephones mounted on the wall.\n\nAs at 20 May 2009, Platform building (1890) was assessed as in good condition; the signal box (1918), also in good condition; the Mulga Road Brick underbridge and pedestrian subway (1905), also good though some damage to underbridge from vehicle; the island Platform (1905), also good; the platform canopies (1992), assessed as in very good condition; and moveable items (1918) including signalling equipment, assessed as in good condition.\n\nThe platform building has intact awnings and intact original form, however windows and doors have been altered. Original weatherboard walls and ripple iron ceilings remain in the interior. The Mulga Road bridge retains its original fabric. The signal box retains its original fabric.\n\n\nAs at 15 April 2013, Oatley Railway Station - its island platform, platform building with signal box extension, moveable items, Mulga Road underbridge, pedestrian subway, and concrete location hut - was of heritage significance. Originally constructed in 1885 and relocated in 1905, Oatley Railway Station is of historical significance as a transport hub with a close relationship to the development of the suburb of Oatley since 1885, including the development of Judd's Hurstville Brickworks which operated nearby from 1884 till 1972. Oatley Railway Station also has historical association with Oatley Memorial Gardens, a series of linear parks to the east, which represent the pre-1905 alignment of the railway line.\n\nOatley Railway Station is of aesthetic significance for its landscape setting, flanked by parks to east and west at its northern end, and for its simple yet attractive weatherboard platform building, one of only two weatherboard platform buildings on the Illawarra line. The Mulga Road underbridge and pedestrian subway are of historical significance as part of a series of railway works for upgrading the railway system, undertaken from 1905 into the 1920s.\n\nOatley railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.\n\nOatley Railway Station, originally constructed 1885 and relocated 1905, is of historical significance as part of the second phase of construction of the Illawarra railway line, and through its relationship to the development of the suburb of Oatley from 1885. Oatley Railway Station appears to have been located in what was then a sparsely populated area due to the opening of Judd's Hurstville Brick Works nearby in 1884. The Mulga Road underbridge and pedestrian subway are of historical significance as part of a series of railway works undertaken to upgrade the line from 1905 into the 1920s. Oatley Railway Station also has historical association with Oatley Memorial Gardens, a series of linear parks to the east between Oatley Parade and Oatley Avenue, which became available as parkland after the realignment of the railway line in 1905.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.\n\nOatley Railway station is of aesthetic significance for its landscape setting, flanked by parks to east and west at its northern end, and for its simple yet attractive Federation Queen Anne style-influenced weatherboard platform building.\n\nThe place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.\n\nThe place has the potential to contribute to the local community's sense of place, and can provide a connection to the local community's past.\n\nThe place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.\n\nThe signal box demonstrates signalling technology of the early 1900s, however there are a number of other examples of this technology on the Illawarra line and elsewhere within the NSW Railways network.\n\nThe place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.\n\nThe weatherboard 1905 platform building is considered a rare example for an urban context, and reflects the semi-rural nature of the area when it was built (the only other example on the Illawarra line of a weatherboard platform building in metropolitan context is at Penshurst), and it is one of only four extant weatherboard platform buildings of its type on the Illawarra line.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.\n\nThe Oatley platform building is an example of a standard roadside building converted to an island platform building. The building is one of four weatherboard standard island platform buildings on the Illawarra line with other examples at Austinmer, Penshurst and Thirroul. The Oatley platform building is the most altered of the four extant examples (note there are 12 stations on the Illawarra line with brick examples of this type of platform building).\n\nThe Mulga Road underbridge is a good representative example of brick arch construction. The Mulga Road underbridge is thought to be the second largest brick arch underbridge in the railway system.\n\nThe concrete location hut is a good representative example of an Inter War period pre-cast concrete railway structure, one of many examples in the NSW Railway network.\n\n"}

After Solo and Chewbacca escape, they flee desperately to a secret Imperial research laboratory surrounded by a cluster of black holes-and go from one danger to a far greater one.\n\nThe story begins with Han Solo and Chewbacca on a diplomatic mission from the New Republic to the spice mines of Kessel.\n\nUnbeknownst to them, Moruth Doole has taken over the space mines, and is convinced the \"Falcon\" with Solo and Chewbacca aboard is a spy ship, a prelude to invasion to seize control of the extremely lucrative spice production facilities. His small fleet, based on Kessel's solo moon, shoots down the emissaries, and brings them to Doole for questioning. He proceeds to do so by ingesting a large quantity of extremely pure glitterstim, which boosts his psychic capabilities to the point where he can forcibly invade Solo's mind and ascertain the truth.\n\nWhen Doole realizes that they are just diplomats, and that he has effectively declared war on the New Republic, he panics. When combined with the fact that he thinks Solo knows he was the one that ratted out he and Chewbacca to the Imperials (the result of which was that Solo was forced to dump his cargo on the Kessel Run; Jabba the Hutt then placed the bounty on his head mentioned in Episode IV), Doole decides the best course is to place the two prisoners in his mines as slave laborers where they will no doubt perish soon. In the mines, the two, with the aid of a young Kyp Durron seek for an escape.\n\nSimultaneously, Luke Skywalker embarks on his search for talented Force-sensitives whom he can mold into Jedi within his new Jedi Praxeum. Lando Calrissian, along with C-3PO and R2-D2, aid Luke with this search. In order to do so, he uses a device that supposedly can detect one's affinity to the Force. Calrissian follows one lead to the Umgullian Blob races where Dack, the possible force-sensitive, is rumored to have predictive abilities due to his successes at gambling. However, Calrissian discovers that he is cheating and exposes him. Rather than be punished by death, as is the law on Umgul, Dack is returned to the Duchess Mistral. In return, Calrissian is rewarded with half of the one million credit reward.\n\nSkywalker, meanwhile has gone to the infested planet Eol Sha where a man named Gantoris is believed to have Force-sensitivity. After two serious tests, one involving fighting a fire dragon, Gantoris agrees to come to the Jedi academy, but is still afraid about the \"Dark man\" he sees in his dreams that will one day end his life. After collecting Streen, an old hermit on Bespin, the trio make their way back to the Yavin 4 where the Jedi academy begins.\n\n"}
{"id": "2013039", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2013039", "title": "Black Belt (region of Alabama)", "text": "Black Belt (region of Alabama)\n\nThe Black Belt is a region of the U.S. state of Alabama. The term originally referred to the region's rich, black topsoil, much of it in the soil order Vertisols. The term took on an additional meaning in the 19th century, when the region was developed for cotton plantation agriculture, in which the workers were enslaved African Americans. After the American Civil War, many freedmen stayed in the area as sharecroppers and tenant farmers, continuing to comprise a majority of the population in many of these counties.\n\nThe physical geography of the \"Black Belt,\" as related to the history of this cotton-dependent region, refers to a much larger region of the Southern United States, stretching from Delaware to Texas but centered on the Black Belt of uplands areas of Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana.\n\nIn the antebellum and Jim Crow eras, the white elite of the Black Belt dominated Alabama state politics well into the 1960s. As in other Southern states, the white-dominated state legislature of Alabama passed laws and a constitution that created barriers to voter registration, essentially disfranchising most blacks and many poor whites.\n\nIn addition, the state legislature did not redistrict congressional or state legislative districts after 1901 until it did so in the 1960s under US Supreme Court order. The white rural elite continued to dominate the state despite the rise of urbanized, industrial cities such as Birmingham. Montgomery, the Black Belt's largest city, has been the capital of Alabama since 1846. Montgomery, Selma and other parts of the Black Belt were important centers of African-American public activism during the Civil Rights Movement from the 1950s to 1968.\n\nSince the black population gained the renewed ability to exercise their franchise after 1965 under the Voting Rights Act, they have largely supported Democratic Party candidates. This is in contrast to the majority-white areas of the state, where since the late 20th century, conservatives have largely shifted from the Democratic to the Republican Party.\n\nThe region is underlain by a thin layer of rich, black topsoil developed atop the chalk of the Selma Group, a geologic unit dating to the Cretaceous. The soils have developed continuously at least since the Pliocene Epoch. Because the underlying chalk is nearly impermeable to groundwater, the black soils tend to dry out during the summer. The natural vegetation of the chalk belt consisted mainly of oak-hickory forest interspersed with shortgrass prairie, while the sandy ridges flanking the chalk belt supported pine forest.\n\nLacking a reliable source of water, the earliest settlers avoided farming the black soil in the belt until the discovery that deep artesian wells could be drilled to supply water for people, livestock, and crops. Beginning in the 1830s after Indian Removal, cotton plantations were developed that produced the commodity crop that became Alabama's greatest source of wealth. Before the American Civil War, these plantations were worked by thousands of African-American slaves. The Black Belt region had the highest density of population in the state and was majority-black.\n\nThe white planters and their elected representatives of the Black Belt established political power in the state legislature in the cotton era; the white rural elite retained their dominance long after the state began to develop more urbanized areas and an industrial economy. The state legislature did not redistrict to reflect population changes and the rise of urban areas from 1901 to 1972, when it was ordered by a federal court, following important apportionment cases such as \"Baker v. Carr\" (1964). Birmingham, the largest and most industrialized city in the state, was among those whose residents, both black and white, had been underrepresented for decades in the state legislature.\n\nThe Black Belt's largest city, Montgomery, was designated as the capital of Alabama in 1846. Because Alabama was geographically central to the slave states, Montgomery was also designated as the original capital of the Confederate States of America. The region's distance from the front lines during the American Civil War saved it from much of the ravages of war. Many of the Greek Revival mansions of the 19th-century planters have survived, as have some of the plantations' slave quarters. Gaineswood in Demopolis and Magnolia Grove in Greensboro, Alabama are among those that can be visited by tourists today.\n\nMany descendants of freed slaves continued to work as sharecroppers and laborers after emancipation, but many migrated among the counties, moved to cities, or left the state for other opportunities. Around 1910–20, the infestation of the cotton crop by the boll weevil destroyed much of the crops and plantation system, but the lingering effects of a cotton economy remain evident. To escape lynchings and social oppression, and after the boll weevil and increased mechanization of agriculture, thousands of African Americans left Alabama to go to industrial cities of the North and Midwest in the Great Migration of the first half of the 20th century. But African Americans continue to make up the majority of the population in most rural Black Belt counties. Today the term \"Black Belt\" is mostly used by scholars and the media as a geologic characterization.\n\nSome of the most important events of the Civil Rights Movement occurred in the Black Belt of Alabama. These included Rosa Parks' refusal to give up her bus seat, which led to the Montgomery Bus Boycott; the Selma to Montgomery marches of 1965 and voter registration reform drives, focusing in Selma, to enable African Americans to vote (see Voting Rights Act). They had been essentially disenfranchised after conservative white Democrats regained political power in the state in the late 19th century. Whites made voter registration and voting so difficult that most blacks and many poor whites were excluded from the political system for decades.\n\nToday, Alabama's rural Black Belt includes some of the poorest counties in the United States. Along with high rates of poverty, the area is typified by declining populations, a primarily agricultural landscape with low-density settlement, high unemployment, poor access to education and medical care, substandard housing and high rates of crime.\n\nThe list of counties comprising the Black Belt is often dependent on the context but historically includes 18 counties:\n\nClarke, Conecuh, Escambia, Monroe, and Washington counties are sometimes included in the region, but are usually considered part of Alabama's southern coastal plain. Lamar does not meet the soil traits but is often included due to its rural character.\n\nAs of the 2000 census, Alabama's 18-county Black Belt region had a population of 589,041 (13.25% of the state's total population). There were 226,191 households and 153,357 families residing within the region.\n\nThe racial makeup of the Black Belt region was 52.24% African American (307,734 people), 45.87% White (270,175 people), 0.25% Native American (1,472 people), 0.52% Asian (3,067 people), 0.03% Pacific Islander (153 people), 0.31% from other races (1,850 people), and 0.78% from two or more races (4,590 people). Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 1.09% of the population (6,404 people).\n\nThe median income for a household in the Black Belt region was $27,130, and the median income for a family was $35,698. Males had a median income of $32,226 versus $22,021 for females. The per capita income for the region was $15,633.\n\nA July 1, 2007 U.S. Census Bureau estimate placed the region's population at 575,783, a decline of 2.25% since 2000.\n\nIn electoral maps of the 20th and early 21st centuries, the Black Belt has appeared as a \"Blue Belt\" because of the voters' strong support for the Democratic Party. With the exception of parts of the city of Birmingham, the outline of Alabama's 7th congressional district roughly matches the western Black Belt region. Terri Sewell (D) currently represents that district in the United States House of Representatives.\n\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1856 by an 1854 act of the New South Wales Legislative Council, it is Australia's oldest university college. St Paul's is familiarly referred to as \"Paul's\", its residents as \"Paulines\" and its alumni as \"Old Paulines\". Alumni include prime ministers, deputy prime ministers, federal and state government ministers, High Court of Australia justices, Court of Appeal presidents and justices, Supreme Court chief justices and justices, pioneering surgeons and physicists, Australian of the Year recipients and 29 Rhodes Scholars. \n\nThe college has nearly 360 residents, of whom about 260 are undergraduate men; the remainder are postgraduate women and men undertaking further study or holding university positions. In 2019, the college opened its modern \"Graduate House\" community with rooms for an additional 140 postgraduate students and university academics. It retains most of its original grant and has its own oval. \n\nSt Paul's was the first university college in Australia. Its development followed an unsuccessful attempt by members of the Anglican Church to incorporate the earlier St James's College within the new University of Sydney, and was led by Sir Alfred Stephen (Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of New South Wales).\n\nThe new governing document provides for a college council with 12 fellows, four of whom must be elected Anglican clergy, six elected laymen and two appointed laymen - one of which must be a University of Sydney academic. Fellows serve six-year, renewable terms and are elected by graduates of the college who have spent at least three semesters in residence. The college is an independent body corporate, legally designated as \"The Warden and Fellows of St Paul's College\".\n\nBy this time the college had its own distinct intellectual tradition, foreshadowed by the founders, a liberal Anglicanism which took seriously the challenges involved in combining religious and secular knowledge and in making the English Church useful to the Australian nation. The number of Paulines from this period who are now listed in the \"Australian Dictionary of Biography\" is evidence of the way the college was in step with the times.\n\nThe original building was designed in Gothic style by English-born architect Edmund Blacket. Blacket was a distinguished ecclesiastical architect; he also designed the main university building and supervised the construction of the Catholic St John's College at the same university. Other buildings include a chapel (designed by John Leslie Stephen Mansfield and completed in 1960) and a residential wing designed by Clive Lucas, Stapleton & Partners which opened in 1999.\n\nIn November 2009, a Sydney paper reported that several former residents of the college (all players on the same social soccer team) were members of a Facebook group described itself as \"pro-rape, anti-consent\". The group was alleged by the reporter to be part of a broader culture amongst privileged youths which demeaned women in a sexist (or sexually violent) way. Warden Ivan Head issued a public response condemning the students' behaviour.\n\nAt the 2010 World University Debating Championship two former Paul's students (Chris Croke and Steve Hind) took the title, winning the final against teams from Oxford, Harvard and the London School of Economics. Since the 1890s, the college has fostered social-justice ideals (as part of the liberal Anglican tradition) and most students are involved at some point in philanthropic activities. During the first decade of the 21st century, half the male Rhodes Scholars from Sydney University have been Paulines. In 2010, Jack Manning Bancroft was named NSW Young Australian of the Year for his work in indigenous education.\n\nOfficially granted by the Earl Marshal in 1961, the college coat of arms displays crossed swords and the Maltese cross to represent St Paul in the official colours of gold and gules. The college's motto, \"Deo Patriae Tibi\", can be translated as \"For God, country and yourself.\"\n\nThe college boasts a long list of academic honours and its website lists many University Medallists since 2005. Its Rhodes Scholarship list is given below:\n\nThe following individuals have served as Warden of St Paul's College:\nIn 2009 a \"pro-rape\" Facebook page was formed by a group of past and present St Paul's students. The page (\"Define Statutory\") described itself as \"anti-consent\". For this, the students of St Paul's received the 2009 Ernie Awards for sexist behaviour.\n\nIn June 2012, an article critical of one of St Paul's dinner events appeared in a local Australian newspaper. The controversy was over an event with the theme \"End of the British Raj\". When the college students arrived in the dress code (\"white tie or colonial uniform\"), they were met by the usual college catering staff, of Indian and south Asian descent, dressed in colourful traditional cultural garments following which the university student newspaper protested against it in a letter, \"British Raj beyond bad taste\". On 6 June 2012, the University Student Representative Council passed a motion condemning the themed party by writing a letter to the college's spokesman and the warden asking for an explanation. Later, many Indian media groups covered this news with copies of the original \"Sydney Morning Herald\" article.\n\nAllegations of systemic sexism and misogyny surfaced again in 2017 following a post on the College's Facebook page which compared women to \"harpooned whales\". The college had refused to participate in a University-wide review into culture led by Elizabeth Broderick. Michael Spence, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sydney raised concerns regarding the \"deep contempt for women\" and the \"cultural problems\" at the college. In June 2017 Ivan Head, the Warden of the College, who had been in the role for 22 years, retired amid concerns regarding his leadership.\n\nAppearing on \"60 Minutes\" in July 2017, the parents of Stuart Kelly, the brother of one-punch attack victim Thomas Kelly who committed suicide in 2016, stated that Kelly had been subjected to hazing and bullying at the college. Kathy Kelly stated \"He went off to university at Sydney, for one night at a college, and he came home a different person the following day ... He was broken.\"\n\nAgain the college came in for sustained criticism after the release of \"The Red Zone\" report by Nina Funnell on 26 February 2017. Reportedly, some rituals allegedly involved male students at Sydney University's residential colleges masturbating into shampoo bottles belonging to female students and defecating in hallways. In particular, Funnell called for the criminalisation of hazing rituals at colleges like St Paul's. Her call for the criminalisation of that conduct follows public comments by Kathy and Ralph Kelly that they believe their son, Stuart Kelly, committed suicide as a result of hazing rituals at the college in 2016. In response, Spence said the University would support a coronial inquest into Stuart's death. Following Broderick's review into College Culture at the University of Sydney's Colleges, St Paul's released a response in which it indicated it would address all recommendations. \n"}

The route connects the Sonoma and Napa valleys with the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta and the Sierra Foothills. It is constructed to freeway standards from the Fulton Road/South Wright Road stoplight in Santa Rosa, to its partial interchange with Farmers Lane (also in Santa Rosa).\n\nThere are six segments that are overlaps with other highways: in the Napa and Sonoma valleys with SR 121, in the southern Napa Valley with SR 29, a short overlap with I-80 at Cordelia Junction in Fairfield, another short overlap with SR 99 in Lodi, and overlaps with SR 88 and SR 26 in the Sierra foothills. The highway is mainly two lane rural highway, with the exception of short segments in Santa Rosa and Fairfield/Suisun City, the overlaps with I-80 and SR 99, and segments within developed areas, such as Santa Rosa and Lodi.\n\nSR 12 begins in the west at its junction with SR 116 in Sebastopol. After passing east through Santa Rosa on a mix of freeway, surface street, and expressway, it turns south into the Sonoma Valley, passing the Jack London State Historic Park at Glen Ellen. It winds through Sonoma on surface streets, where the historic Vallejo Estate and Sonoma Mission, both part of the Sonoma State Historic Park, are.\n\nSouth of Sonoma, SR 12 turns east, joining SR 121 for nearly nine miles, then turns south briefly as it leaves SR 121 and joins the four-lane expressway SR 29 to cross the Napa River. Four miles after joining SR 29 it splits off towards the east on Jameson Canyon Road; this section is also the 1928 re-alignment of the Lincoln Highway, the first road across America. After a brief merge with Interstate 80, SR 12 branches off to the east as an expressway through Fairfield and Suisun City. East of Suisun it becomes two lanes again and crosses south of Travis Air Force Base, through rolling fields with numerous wind turbines. Just past Braid's Bridge is the Western Railway Museum. At Rio Vista, SR 12 crosses the Helen Madere Memorial Bridge over the Sacramento River, entering the California Delta.\n\nThis stretch of the river has twice been the site of much-publicized inland excursions by humpback whales, presumably veering off course while making their annual migrations along the Pacific coast. In 1985 Humphrey the whale swam about as far as the Rio Vista Bridge. In 2007 a humpback mother and calf dubbed Delta and Dawn circled for several days just upstream of the bridge, seemingly reluctant to pass under it again after having spent the previous three or four weeks upriver near Sacramento.\n\nFrom the Sacramento River to the junction with Interstate 5, SR 12 crosses several of the waterways of the California Delta and the low-lying fields between them. Through Lodi it becomes a wide four-lane business route. After another brief merger with another freeway, this time SR 99, SR 12 heads east into the Sierra foothills (with shared segments with SR 88 and SR 26) before ending at the junction with SR 49 just north of San Andreas.\n\nSR 12 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and from I-80 to SR 88 is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 12 is eligible to be included in the State Scenic Highway System; however, it is only designated as a scenic highway from its intersection with Danielli Avenue east of Santa Rosa to its junction with London Way near Agua Caliente, meaning that it is a substantial section of highway passing through a \"memorable landscape\" with no \"visual intrusions\", where the potential designation has gained popular favor with the community.\n\nSR 12 has been designated by various state laws and through local usage as the Valley of the Moon Scenic Route (the portion running through Sonoma County, though the first sign with this name is at the intersection of Farmers Lane and Fourth Street in Santa Rosa); Luther Burbank Memorial Highway from Santa Rosa to Sebastopol (after botanist Luther Burbank).\nSR 12 is also known as Sonoma Highway between Santa Rosa and the west side of the city of Sonoma; \nBroadway between Sonoma Plaza and its junction with SR 121 in Schellville; \nCarneros Highway for the length of its concurrency with 121 between Schellville and its junction and the north end of its concurrency with SR 29 near Napa; \nJameson Canyon Road from where its concurrency with SR 29 ends in American Canyon to its junction with I-80 in Cordelia; \nand Rio Vista Highway from I-80 to SR 160 east of Rio Vista, and informally as \"Blood Alley\" from Lodi to Fairfield. The segment through Lodi to the overlap with SR 99 is on Kettleman Lane.\n\nBefore the 1964 renumbering, this route was signed as Sign Route 12 for most of its length. However, SR 12 was designated as Legislative Route 51 (LR 51) from SR 116 to SR 121 before the 1964 renumbering. Portions of the route from SR 29 to I-80 ran concurrently with State Route 29 or with State Route 37; this was also LR 8 and a former routing of US 40. The portion from I-80 to then-US 99 was designated as LR 53 in 1919; from US 99 to SR 49, it was designated as LR 24.\n\nIn 1976, the discontinuity resulting from the concurrency with State Route 84 was removed.\n\nPlans call for a western extension of its western terminus to State Route 1 near Bodega Bay. Plans also called for Route 12 to be built as a freeway from Farmers Lane to Melita Road, in Santa Rosa; however, as of 2014, this project was delayed due to community opposition.\n\n\n"}

He is well known as a theoretical chemist who also does experimental research, having spent much of his career working in multiple areas of physical chemistry. He is currently the Frank P. Hixon Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus at the University of Chicago. During his tenure at the University of Chicago, Rice has trained more than 100 Ph.D. students and postdoctoral researchers. He received the National Medal of Science in 1999.\n\nStuart Rice attended the Bronx High School of Science, received his bachelor's degree in 1952 from Brooklyn College, and earned his master's and doctorate from Harvard University in 1954 and 1955, respectively. He was almost unable to attend graduate school due to contracting tuberculosis, but was cured of the disease through an experimental treatment of isoniazid and streptomycin. He remained at Harvard as a Junior Fellow for three years, although he spent the last two years of the fellowship doing research work at Yale University's Chemistry Department. After the fellowship, he joined the faculty of The University of Chicago in 1957, where he has remained since.\n\nRice has served the university in a wide variety of capacities during his fifty-seven year tenure. He served as the director of the James Franck Institute (the university's center for physical chemistry and condensed matter physics) from 1961 to 1967. He was Chairman of the Department of Chemistry from 1971 to 1976 and was Dean of the Physical Sciences Division from 1981 to 1995. He served as Dean for the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago from October 2006 through October 2010, and has served as Interim President of the Institute since October 2010.\n\nIn addition to his work at the University, he is currently on the Board of Governors at Tel Aviv University and has served as editor for the journals \"Chemical Physics Letters\" and \"Advances in Chemical Physics\", and co-authored several physical chemistry textbooks with Stephen Berry and John Ross.\n\nStuart Rice began his scientific career as a high school student and published on this work. He completed his doctoral dissertation under Paul Doty, contributing to the then-emerging field of DNA research; the project shared both experimental and theoretical components, which became a hallmark of his later work.\n\nDuring his time at Yale, Stuart Rice began to study the transport properties of liquids. He helped to determine the properties of liquid noble gases and methane, while also exploring the theoretical background of transport in liquids as well, comparing the results to simulations of Lennard-Jones fluids.\n\nFollowing this work he helped to develop the theory of electronic excitations (excitons) in molecular crystals and liquids, eventually moving into the area of radiationless molecular transitions, beginning his own experimental work after the development of the Bixon-Jortner model, while also working with collaborators on extending the theoretical model of these transitions. This research led him to investigate the effects of quantum chaos on excited molecules, and to couple the developing model of transitions with quantum chaos in order to attain control of the transition of excited molecules. This led to the field of Coherent control, quantum control through laser excitation, which was developed by other scientists at the University of Chicago.\n\nAt the same time, he also began work on understanding the electrical properties of liquid metals, where the lack of translational orders frustrated attempts to understand their electronic band structure. The discrepancy between the dielectric results of reflectivity and ellipsometry data of liquid mercury led to work on the nature of conductivity at the liquid-vapor surface of liquid metal, ultimately showing that the existence of ion inhomogeneities at the interface led to electronic changes in the bulk liquid that persist for several atomic diameters into a liquid.\n\nSmaller research topics that Rice has published on included work on the chemistry of water, the theory of freezing liquids, the properties of monolayers on liquids, and confined colloidal systems, amongst others.\n\nRice's most prestigious award is the National Medal of Science, the highest scientific prize awarded in the United States, in 1999. He was awarded the Wolf Prize in Chemistry in 2011, along with Krzysztof Matyjaszewski and Ching Tang. He is a Fellow of both the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1970 Rice was awarded the Llewellyn John and Harriet Manchester Quantrell Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching, the nation’s oldest prize for undergraduate teaching, a highly esteemed faculty award at The University of Chicago.\n\nOver the course of his long career Rice has shaped much debate on theoretical physical chemistry. He is cited on the National Medal of Science \"for changing the very nature of modern physical chemistry through his research, teaching and writing, using imaginative approaches to both experiment and theory that have inspired a new generation of scientists.\" With over 100 doctoral students to his credit, Stuart Rice has had a great impact on the field of physical chemistry simply through the number of research scientists he has trained. Theoretical chemist David Tannor, who is the Hermann Mayer Professorial Chair in the Department of Chemical Physics at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, did his post-doc work with Stuart Rice and David W. Oxtoby at the University of Chicago.\n\nRice is also famous on campus for eating lunch almost every weekday at the university's Quadrangle Club restaurant (a faculty club), where he has dined over 9,000 times. Rice is known to sit at the head of the Chemistry table, not because he is the most senior member of the department, but because he is very tall.\n\nRice was married to Marian Coopersmith from 1952 until her death in 1994.\n\n"}

{"id": "2013108", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2013108", "title": "Worcester, Western Cape", "text": "Worcester, Western Cape\n\nWorcester ( ) is a town in the Western Cape, South Africa. It is located north-east of Cape Town on the N1 highway north to Johannesburg.\n\nBeing the largest town in the Western Cape's interior region, it serves as the administrative capital of the Breede Valley Local Municipality and as regional headquarters for most central and Provincial Government Departments. The town also serves as the hub of the Western Cape's interior commercial, distribution and retail activity with a shopping mall, well developed central business district and infrastructure.\n\nWorcester is located at an elevation of and can be reached by road either travelling on the N1 highway through the Huguenot Tunnel or by driving through spectacular Mountain passes. From Cape Town Du Toitskloof, from Wellington Bainskloof, from Malmesbury, Western Cape Nieuwekloof, from Ceres Mitchells, from Robertson Goree, from Hermanus Rooihoogte and from Johannesburg Hex River, with vistas over the Hex River Valley.\n\nGeographically, the district is delimited mainly by mountains; to the southwest lies the massive Stettyns mountain range with an annual rainfall in excess of 2000 mm. To the west lie the Du Toitskloof Mountains and northwest lies the Slanghoek, Little Drakenstein, Elandskloof and Lemiet mountain ranges. To the north rises the Hex River Mountains which include the towering peaks of Chavonness, Brandwacht, Fonteintjiesberg and Audensberg. Northeast of the town the colourful Keerom Mountain runs into the Langeberg range.\n\nWorcester and its surroundings form part of the Breede River catchment area, which is fed by a number of smaller rivers supplemented by the run-off from the winter snows in the mountains. The district also includes the Hex River Valley.\n\nIn the early days of the Cape's history the main road through the great mountain barrier which stretches northwards from the Hottentots-Holland, Wemmershoek and Slanghoek mountains to the Groot Winterhoek mountains, lay through the Roodezand Pass into the valley of Tulbagh. From here the road gave access in the south-east to \"the original great rift valley of Africa\" as Jan Smuts once described the Breede River Valley.\n\nWorcester district is as old as hunting grounds and cattle runs go in the Cape, but new as a settled area. Before 1700, the area now known as the Breede River Valley was a hunter's paradise, teeming with game and wild birds. The main source of income, especially the sale of elephant tusks came from hunting licenses issued by the Dutch East India Company. By 1709 European farmers were given grazing rights in the area \"over de Breede Rivier.\" In 1714 the first quitrent farms were released. Settlement in most cases was not on a permanent basis and \"Hartebees huisies\" were erected. When European settlers first arrived at the later Cape Colony, the Breede River Valley was inhabited by San hunter/gatherers and Khoi livestock farmers. The Gainou, Korannas and Afrikaner tribes traded livestock with the settlers. With the European settlers came the smallpox virus, that would turn into an epidemic for the Khoi people and by 1713 would take its toll on their existence as a people.\n\nEuropean settlement took place at Waay Hoek, Bossiesveld, Kleinbosch, Slanghoek, Brandvalley, Vendutiekraal, Rooye Wal and Doornrivier. The first farms in the Hex River Valley were Kloppersbosch and De Buffelskraal, dating from 1731. With the European settlers came their slaves and eventually so-called free Khoi, who would settle on the farms as labourers.\n\nWith the Cape Colony interior expanding with the settlement of an increasing number of European settlers, Lord Charles Somerset instructed Magistrate Fischer of Tulbagh, to find a location to establish a new deputy magisterial seat during 1818. Fischer duly reported that the two quitrent farms, De Lange Rug and Roodedraai, be bought for this purpose. On 9 January 1819 the Colonial surveyors, Tulleken and Hertzog cartographed the two farms and on 4 November, the first official advertisement for the sale of plots was issued. On 28 February 1820, the official date of the establishment of Worcester, 89 of the proclaimed 144 plots were sold. Fischer also reported that \"this place becomes more important when the new road over the Franschhoek Mountains will be completed.\" The African Rifles Regiment started construction of this road in 1819.\n\nA winter storm in 1822 caused damage to the town of Tulbagh. Captain Charles Trappes recommended to Somerset that the magisterial seat be moved to the new town.\n\nBy 1830, 329 farms were cultivated in the district and by 1832 the town of Worcester was becoming a frontier town with the Market Square being used for stock sales. Many a fine animal changed ownership in the days when Worcester was a jumping off spot for the \"togryers\" of the 19th century.\n\nBy the 1850s the necessity for the formation of a hamlet west of the Breede River had become clear; the ward was cut off from Worcester during the rainy season when the river burst it banks regularly. The farm Aan-de-Smalblaar was transported to Johannes Petrus Jordaan on 23 July 1858. Jan Jordaan divided a portion of the farm into 57 residential plots and these were sold at a Public Auction on 11 June 1859. The hamlet of Rawsonville was named for William Rawson, the Cape Colonial Secretary.\n\nGerman settlers employed as \"tagloners\" on the surrounding farms from 1860 onwards, would soon use the abundance of fertile soil, water and their skilled labour to see the area evolve from livestock farming to cultivated land, orchards and vineyards. By 1865 the production from the flourishing vineyards compared favourably with the Stellenbosch and Paarl valleys. Much of the crop was dried for raisins, and this continued to be an important aspect of the local industry into the 20th century. The decline in the demand for raisins after the Second World War persuaded most of the farmers to convert to wine-grape growing: and in response to this change an extensive network of co-operative wineries sprang up. Today the Breede River Valley is the largest wine-producing region in South Africa, contributing almost 25% of the country's viticultural output. The Olof Bergh Solera Brandy Cellar and the KWV Brandy Cellar form part of the South African Brandy Route and 33 wineries produce and bottle in the Worcester area.\n\nThe first export grapes planted in the Hex River Valley dates from 1875. Today the Hex River Valley produces more than 17 million cartons of table grapes per annum. In the dryer southern regions of the valley, Olive production have also been added in recent years.\n\nCentral to this agricultural production, is the Greater Brandvlei Dam, with a capacity of 342 million cubic litres. The dam was completed in 1936, fully extended by 1987 and provides water to various irrigation schemes in the valley.\nLord Charles Somerset named the new town for his eldest brother, the Marquis of Worcester and by 1840, 132 of the original 144 plots were sold.\n\nCaptain Charles Trappes was responsible for the planning of the town. A dubious character in some ways, Trappes, however, was far in advance of his time when he laid out the wide streets and town blocks with vision and a high regard for squares. Trappes made the early builders put the houses close to the street and soon these builders would develop their own style of gables. An early visitor, James Backhouse found 1300 people living in the rising town in 1840. According to the 1844 Cape Almanac, William Watson ran one of the best hotels in the country and Bishop Gray said in 1845 that the houses were a great distance from each other.\n\nThe Worcester District Council was proclaimed on 20 December 1855. The boundaries were northwest – Kleinberg, northeast – Bloutoring, southeast – Mowers Heights, southwest – Roodehoogte and west – Du Toitskloof Mountains.\n\nSub division of the original plots dates back to the 1860s when the town experienced its first economic boon. By the 1890s, when there was a downturn in economic fortune the population grew at a considerable rate, as landless people moved to town. Small industry, business and residence still operated within the original boundaries of the town. During the 1890s Worcester's community would also evolve into an uptown section for rich and middle-class people and a downtown section for so called poor Whites and Coloured people. Even the Dutch Reformed Congregation would censure European and Coloured people living under desegregated circumstances.\n\nWorcester received Municipal status on 30 September 1895. A Town Council, consisting of 8 members governed the town.\n\nWhen Black Africans returned to Worcester at the end of the First World War, they were mainly employed as cheap labour for new construction programs springing up around town. By 1936, 1271 Black African people were living in the Worcester district.\n\nAt the end of the Second World War, housing in Worcester was at a premium and Worcester had a squatter camp at Parkersdam. It was also during these years that Worcester started to expand with new residential areas and an industrial area. The Apartheid regime responded by total segregation of the different communities.\n\nIn the Coloured area 1350 sub-economic dwellings and 584 economic dwellings were built in Esselen Park Uitbreiding (extension) also known as \"ICE CHASSIS\", Roodewal and Riverview, in addition, 230 plots were sold in Esselen Park for the erection of dwellings by purchasers. Mostly Indian traders were forced to move their businesses from the declared White areas and resettle in the downtown business district of Durban Street.\n\nThe Zweletemba township, to the southeast of the town, was awarded 524 sub-economic, 300 economic dwellings and two hostel schemes of 1274 units for single persons. Due to the policy of Apartheid, these people were not considered to be permanent residents and it was only after the abolishment of influx control in 1986 that the township population really exploded.\n\nA further 67 sub-economic and 137 economic dwellings were developed in the White Areas and affluent residential areas towards the north of the town. The early years of Apartheid would also see the old town being transformed into a central business district. Most of the character and charm of the old buildings was lost as the then government and society replaced these buildings with new administrative and retail buildings, based on \"New-World\" consumerism. Grand Apartheid would leave the community divided and in segregated living areas.\n\nA separate Management Committee for Coloured People was introduced on 2 April 1965. With the coming of democracy to South Africa, Worcester now forms part of the Breede Valley Local Municipality.\n\n\nWorcester experiences more extremes of temperature than neighbouring Cape Town, as oceanic influences are blocked by the Du Toitskloof and Slanghoek mountain ranges to the west. The daytime maximum in summer averages in the low 30 °C's, but some days in February can reach in excess of 40 °C. Summer is generally dry with the rare late summer thunderstorm, whilst spring and autumn are shoulder seasons of pleasant temperatures ranging from an average 10 °C minimum to 25 °C maximum, with the occasional rain shower. Winters are generally very windy and often cool to cold with snow being common on the higher lying ground above 1500m. Daytime maximums range from 10 °C-17 °C, with minimums hovering at or just above freezing. Winter brings most of Worcester's 175 mm of annual rainfall. The town lies in a curious rain-shadow phenomenon caused by the surrounding high mountains.\n\nThere are a number of wards within the Worcester District, reflecting a marked internal variation in soil types and micro-climates. In the Breede River, Botha, Slanghoek and Goudini wards the soils are sandy loams with a varying loose stone content and a fairly high, free water table. Along the river banks in the Nuy, Doornrivier, Aan De Doorns and Overhex wards, fertile alluvial and calcareous clayish soils can be found.\n\nThe annual average rainfall in the Slanghoek area is in excess of 1500mm, in contrast with a low 300mm in the Nuy and Scherpenheuvel areas to the east and southeast.\n\nGeorge Parker owned a shop and managed the first Post Office on the south side of town, from 1824 to 1860. His salary as Post Master was about 24 ZAR per year, and as Shopkeeper, by ordinance, he had to supply twelve months worth of credit to clients. The town of Worcester was founded as an administrative seat and to create a church and central market place for the frontier farmers. With the market established, Scottish artisans settled in town, bringing their skills as tinsmiths, coppersmiths, blacksmiths, shoemakers etc. By the mid-1830s the Colonial interior was starting to open up and Worcester as frontier town would gain by this. The first economic boon would come in the form of livestock trading and fresh produce farming followed by the development of a wagon industry. Due to the fact that Worcester was the last town before the Karoo interior, hotels and shops started to spring up to replenish travellers. With a solid foundation for economic development laid by 1845 and the road across the Bainskloof pass completed in 1852, bringing quicker access to Cape Town, it was time for Worcester to move forward.\n\nThe Worcester Commercial Bank Unlimited was officially established in 1856. Due to growth in the wagon making industry, the Bank ran into a credit crisis by 1864. Discounting of bills of exchange became difficult and investors started to withdraw their money. Only a £6000 capital injection by the board of directors saved the Bank from ruin. The discovery of diamonds brought a steadier stream of prospectors travelling through Worcester. This led to the opening of more shops and lodgings and other facilities to meet their needs and a rise in the town's population.\n\nThese factors led to the early construction of a diverse and cosmopolitan society in Worcester, outside of Cape Town, the only town that would develop as such in the Western Province during the late 19th century. In 1890 the African Banking Corporation was established in London, all branches were overseas. The Bank was formed as a consortium bank owned jointly by Lloyds Bank, National Provincial, Westminster and Standard Bank of South Africa. In December 1891, Articles of Agreement were drawn up with the Worcester Bank and operations were handed over to African Banking Corporation in February 1892.\n\nFinance would bring the Industrial Revolution to Worcester and economic growth really started once the railway line reached the town in 1876. The previous decade saw German artisans arriving from Pomerania, employed by farmers. These German labourers would bring their skills as expert farmers and would play a major role in the development of the farming industry.\n\nA second group of German settlers followed in the 1870s to help with railway line construction. They again would bring skills as highly trained artisans. By the 1880s a Jewish community of traders and capital rich business people would follow. The early 1900s saw the first Greek residents and business people. Belgian, French, Italian and Portuguese communities all settled in Worcester at the end of World War II.\n\nBy 1882 the Cape Colonial Government proclaimed that the railway line should be extended to Robertson. The New Cape Central Railway Company (NCCR) undertook the construction of this line and it was completed in September 1887. Newspapers of the era informed the public of 3 up and 3 down trains on a daily basis. In addition to the new line, railway sidings were established throughout the district. From Cape Town at Breërivier, Botha's Halt, Goudini Road and Chavonnes. To Kimberley at De Wet, Sandhills and Orchard. On the NCCR line at Overhex and Nuy. In 1883 the Reverend William Murray and the Church Council petitioned the Cape Colonial Government against the use of trains on Sundays.\n\nBy the 1880s 40 companies manufactured wagons in Worcester, Fairbairn- Durban- and Riebeeck Streets housed these factories. The Worcester Industry slowly died as the railway lines became a more effective mode of transportation.\n\nThe Western Wine and Brandy Company founded in 1895 built the first distillery in Porter Street. By 1918 the KWV was founded and took control of the distillery.\n\nJS Naudè & Co controlled the buying and distribution of deciduous fruit from 1899 onwards. The company developed internal, African and in later years European markets. By 1960 all the companies in Worcester amalgamated to form Deciduous Fruit Distributors of Worcester.\n\nThe Prune Growers Association was founded in 1890; by 1907 this organisation was changed to a company, which would become Safari SAD. The first branch opened in Porter Street in 1921.\n\nThe Union Vinegar Company was established in 1913. It was the first South African factory to produce Beetroot salad. Other products included vinegar, pickled onions, piccalilly, tomato sauce and Worcester sauce.\n\nSimon and Woolf Heller were merchants in dried fruit. In 1930 they established a Jam Factory. With the outbreak of the Second World War the Standard Fruit Company received an order for 170 000 cases of jam. The company was transformed into a public company, Standard Canners and Packers. In 1954 Langeberg Food Processors Ltd bought the controlling stock.\n\nIn 1952 Eskom's Hex River Power Station came into production. It was built primarily for railway electrification and additional supply of electricity for rural areas. The Power Station was demolished in 1990.\n\nThe main incentive in 1949 for the establishment of Hex River Textiles Mills Ltd was the plentiful supply of labour, as well as the suitability of the Hex River's water for the purpose. Operating at its peak during the 1960s, the factory employed 1200 workers.\n\nThe multi national company, Rainbow Chicken Ltd invested substantial capital in farms and a factory in Worcester during the 1970s. Today some light industries such as millers, coldddrink manufacturers, food manufacturers, furniture manufacturers, paint manufacturers, joineries and engineering works are located in the town.\n\nWorcester originally drew its water from the Hex River. The early water distribution method was very primitive. The water ran in over Joubert's Mill and then flowed in open channels through the town. The first reservoir and distribution pipes were built in 1875. In 1910 a diversion and storage dam had been constructed in Fairy Glen, followed by the completion of a filtration and chlorination plant in 1936. By 1945 Worcester started planning to build a proper water impounding scheme. Construction of the Stettynskloof Dam started in 1952. The work was undertaken by Beton und Monierbau Aktiengesellschaft of Düsseldorf, Germany. Dr. Heinz Schulze was the head engineer and work was completed in 1955.\n\nAfter completion of the town's sewerage scheme in 1934 considerable development took place in the Worcester Municipal area. The sewerage purification works was completed in 1962, with an estimated life span of 30 years.\n\nIn 1846 construction on the Bainskloof Pass started, Andrew Geddes Bain was the head engineer and the road was completed in 1852. By November 1863, only 60 kilometres of railway line (from Cape Town to Wellington) was in operation in the whole of \"South Africa\". However the discovery of diamonds in Kimberley, and the attainment of Responsible Government for the Cape Colony in 1872, prompted the Cape Prime Minister John Molteno to start expansion of the railway- and telegraph lines to Kimberley.\nThe Cape Government Railways were immediately formed for this purpose. Thomas Brounger was appointed as the head railway engineer, and with the help of Thomas Bain, the line to Worcester was opened on 16 June 1876. On the opening of the station at Worcester, the Cape Argus reported as follows:\n\n\"Worcester, on June 16, 1876, was the scene of elaborate ceremony and of a very large and distinguished assemblage to witness the railway opening by Sir Henry Barkly. After the address had been presented to the Governor and His Excellency's reply, there were short speeches by Sir Arthur Cunningham, Commander of the Forces, and Sir John Molteno, the Cape Prime Minister, and an adjournment made to the grand luncheon or banquet. In the evening there was a ball, at which most people enjoyed themselves, undeterred by the failure of the lighting and refreshments arrangement.\"\n\nDuring 1875 the farm De Doorns in the Hex River Valley was bought by the Cape Colonial Government to build a railway station. Around this station the hamlet of De Doorns would develop. By 1877, the line already reached Montagu Road on its way to Kimberley and in 1883 the name was changed to Touws River. Construction of an additional main railway line during 1931 would lead to the establishment of Matroosberg station.\n\nOn 25 June 1916 the first supply of electricity to Worcester was provided by 2 x 40 kW 220 volt direct current water turbine generators. Growth was slow but steady and by 1921 Worcester had its own Power Station Building. By 1933 overloading at peak periods necessitated increased capacity. Eskom provided a single standby line. By 1948 Eskom started construction on the Hex River Power Station. The power station came into production in 1952 and the municipal main sub-station was connected to Eskom, all supply was then taken from this source.\n\nDuring the early years, religion played a comprehensive part in the development of Worcester as a town. Though the new town was still underdeveloped, by 1821, the Dutch Reformed Church congregation was already established in Worcester. The Reverend Henry Sutherland, a Scotsman, served the congregation from 1824 to 1859.\n\nAfter the abolition of slavery in 1834, the so-called \"Coloured quarter\" of town started to populate, south of Durban Street, between Rainer- and Grey Streets. This community was mainly composed of free slaves and 24 plots were set aside for development in 1840. For the next 110 years, the Rhenish Missionary Society would play an important part in the development of this community. Worcester's first Mission Church was established in 1832. The Rhenish Mission complex situated on the corner of High- and Adderley streets forms an integral part of the rich Worcester cultural and architectural heritage. The coloured community owned farms, Hendrik Gertse at Hex River, Andreas Jasons at Brandwacht, Jeftha Fransman at Goudini while the Afrika, Hartzenberg, Everts, Solomons, Romans and Titus families were employed as labourers.\n\nThe Anglican church in Worcester, St James the Great, was established in 1851/2. The church was designed by Sophy Gray. The first rector was the Reverend John Melville-Martine M.A., who previously had been vicar of Shipley, Sussex. Melville-Martine also ministered at Brigus in Canada.\n\nThe Malay community was known as bricklayers, vat coopers and tailors in Worcester and dates back to the era of free slaves in the 1830s. Application to construct a mosque was first filed in 1867. Permission was granted in 1880 and by 1881 the Muslim community started to use the premises at Durban Street.\n\nThe first Germans settled in Worcester during the 1860s as skilled farm labourers. During the 1870s a second wave of German artisans helped with the construction of the railway line and in return received Crown property at Goudini Road in 1880. A Lutheran congregation was established and the church building was completed in November 1883.\n\nThe first Congregational church was built at 54 Porter Street in 1894. The site had disadvantages, in particular\" the aroma from the vinegar factory next door.\" In 1948 the property was sold and the present fine church was erected in Church Street.\n\nIn 1848, Dr Diederich Heinrich Fraenkel found his way to Worcester to become District Surgeon, his father, Dr Siegfried Fraenkel, was the first conforming Jew to reside at the Cape. Educated at SACS, Dr Fraenkel was the first Jewish resident at Worcester. Jewish traders began to settle in Worcester during the 1880s, a plot of ground was purchased in 1902 from the Municipality to establish a Jewish cemetery. The first Hebrew congregation was founded in 1903 and in 1904 the synagogue was consecrated in Durban Street.\n\nThe work of the Salvation Army in Worcester began in 1891, when Captain Lotz \"opened fire\" and became the first Commanding Officer in charge. Brother Craayenstein, born in 1868, kept the work of the Corps going visibly. A faithful soldier to the Army for many decades, he was a familiar figure in Worcester, attending the Saturday night Open-Air meetings with his violin, which he also took to the goal every Sunday morning for service. After the Saturday night meetings he was welcomed into the public bars, whose customers put money liberally into the box he carried for the Army. In January 1961 Worcester's oldest and most faithful soldier of the Salvation Army was promoted to Glory – the Army's term for dying.\n\nDuring the 1920s the Methodist Church started with missionary work under the Xhosa community and by 1937 the Dutch Reformed Church followed in the Basotho community. By 1938 the missionary societies rented a hall where church and school could be attended.\n\nThe origins of Worcester Boys High dates back to 1824 when schooling started in Worcester. Magistrate Truter, District Surgeon Glaeser and Reverend Sutherland served on the School Commission when the Government Free School reached the town in 1830. School was attended six days a week and subjects included Dictatation, Reading, Grammar, Writing, Arithmetic and Translating from Dutch into English. School started at 8am, finished at 4pm with a two-hour break at 11am.\n\nThe official formation of the school took place on 2 July 1873 when the \"Undenominational Boys Public school\" was declared. By June 1882 the school was classified as a Class 1 Public School and by 1899 a high school. In 1972 Worcester Boys' High and Worcester Girls High amalgamated and formed Worcester High School. Worcester High School operated for 20 years before amalgamating once more in 1992, with Worcester East High School. This joining formed Worcester Gymnasium, which opened in January 1992, on the grounds of the former school. Parts of the Boys' Highs' building are still used.\n\nThe Ladies Seminary was founded by the Dutch Reformed Church in January 1876 after a period of 3 years when no education was offered to girls in Worcester. By 1908 it became a Girls High School.\n\nSchools for Deaf and Blind people were founded in 1881 by the Dutch Reformed Church. Two world-renowned schools developed out of humble beginnings. From the 1880s to 1899 the Lutheran and Anglican Churches operated their own schools in town. Coloured children were allowed to attend the Lutheran School to receive a higher education.\n\nWorcester Practising Shool (Oefen Skool) was established in 1938 as one of the primary schools for coloured children.\n\nDuring the Second Boer War, Prisoners of War were sent to St Helena, Ceylon etc. Many of the young boys never received or completed an education. The Dutch Reformed Church founded a school in what became the birth of adult education. Students were taught in the Gospel but also learned trades. The Drostdy was handed over by Government for this purpose in 1903 and by 1911 it had developed into an Industrial School. Since 1944 it is known as the Drostdy Technical High School.\n\nA Muslim school has been in operation in Worcester since the 1840s. In 1835 a Mission School where elementary education was offered was started by the Rhenish Missionary Society. By the end of the first World War the Venerable Söhnge came to Worcester with instructions from the Society to develop a Teachers Training College for Coloured people.\nThe Dutch Reformed Mission Church, who had by then taken over the duties of the Rhenish Society, started a school for Coloured deaf children in 1933. Ironically it was under the Apartheid system that schools were first built for the Coloured and Black African communities. During the Apartheid years, education was only offered on an elementary level in the Zweletemba township.\n\nMontana is another High School in the northern part of the town, founded in 1972.\n\nIn 1997 an English-medium independent school was founded. Known as Lanner House after the indigenous Lanner falcon, the school provides education for children from preschool to Grade 9. Despite the fact that the language of instruction is English, an increasing number of Afrikaans families are enrolling their children in the school.\n\nIn 2014 the Stellenbosch University Ukwanda campus was opened officially. This campus is utilized by the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences of Stellenbosch University to train final year students of the occupational therapy, physiotherapy, human nutrition, speech and language therapy and medical programs.\n\nIn August 2015, construction on a new high school, Somerset High, began and was completed in December 2016. The school began its' first academic year in 2017.\n\nThe first edition of the Worcester Weekly News was printed on 31 July 1880. The proprietor was Mr Watson and issues published under this masthead until 17 August 1882. J.E. de Jong was a master-printer from Deventer, Overijssel, Netherlands. He settled in Cape Town in 1875 and worked for The Cape Argus Printing and Publishing Company. By 1882 he had moved to Worcester and bought the Worcester Weekly News. From August 1882 he changed the name to the Worcester Advertiser, politically supported the Afrikanerbond and would criticise the Second Boer War in later years.\n\nBy 1894 the town was experiencing a solid population growth and the then Cape Colony Premier, Cecil John Rhodes realised that to gain influence with the public he needed the local newspaper to support his policies. De Jong was offered £5000 for his newspaper and a salary of £500 per annum. De Jong refused the offer and Rhodes decided to start his own newspaper, The Worcester Standard. These two papers ran in opposition until 1927, when they amalgamated to form the Worcester Standard and Advertiser. During the Anglo-Boer War, De Jong was jailed at Tokai.\n\nThe paper remained in private proprietary until 1980, when it was sold to Naspers. The paper publishes to this day, making it one of the oldest local newspapers in South Africa.\n\nLawn Tennis was played at the Standard Courts from 1877 and by 1906, two clubs played competitive tennis in Worcester. On 3 January 1877, a Worcester Cricket team played for the first time against a Cape Town side. Matches took place at Church-, Market and Queen Squares. Players were organised into three local teams, Rangers, Worcester and United and played their matches on Saturdays.\n\nIn 1905 the MCC under Pelham Plum Warner played a match against a combined Worcester side. From 1908 matches were played in league format and competition for the Perkins Cup started. From 1916 to 1925 Richard Robins (Dick) Luyt played for the Worcester Club as well as representing Western Province in the Currie Cup Competition. On 20 and 21 January 1925, Luyt captained a Western Province Country Districts side at Worcester when they played against the Solomon Joel XI. During the 1950s Luyt would become a Springbok cricket selector. Between 1921 and 1922, the Springbok cricketer Jimmy Blanckenberg played for Worcester and on 2 August 1931; Eddie Fuller was born in Worcester.\n\nBoland Park would have to wait until the 1990s to see provincial cricket again. By this time Claude Henderson, born and educated at Worcester was the new cricketing star. Peter Kirsten, Gary Kirsten, Tim Shaw, Rudi Bryson, Phillip Amm, Kepler Wessels, Adrian Kuiper, Terence Lazard and John Commins would all score centuries at Boland Park. During April 1993, Glamorgan played against Warwickshire in an over limited match at Boland Park. Henderson would go on to represent South Africa in 7 test matches and 4 ODI's.\n\nBarry Fairy Heatlie was born at Glen Heatlie in the district of Worcester, on 25 April 1872, one of nine brothers who were all good athletes and sportsmen. He was selected for Western Province at the age of 18, and for South Africa in his 20th year. Altogether he represented Western Province in 41 matches and he was never on the losing side in 26 Currie Cup matches. Heatlie was a big, robust forward and an intelligent, inspiring leader. When Heatlie was given the captaincy of the South Africans for the final test in 1896, he decided to supply his team with jerseys from the Old Diocesan Club. It was a happy coincidence that the jerseys were green and that South Africa therefore won her first international wearing what was to become the national colour. South Africa won the test 5 – 0 and afterwards Heatlie was carried around the field in triumph. Barry Heatlie and his 14 hereos had to rely on public transport to get home after their historic triumph.\n\nIn 1882 a Worcester Rugby team played in the first recorded match against De Doorns, \"A special train was engaged and a tremendous crowd of enthusiasts proceeded to the Valley for a whole day's picnicking and some football.\" The Church Council complained about this \"tendency of the age,\" matches played on Saturday afternoon interfered with the Preparation Service for Sunday Sermon. The Rugby Club was founded by Jimmy de Jongh, a local lawyer and started competition in the Western Province Country League in 1884. For the first league match played against Malmesbury, the team left Worcester on the Thursday to only return on Monday. Malmesbury declared match day as a Public Holiday. Charles Heatlie represented the Cape Colony against the first British side in 1891 and under his captaincy Worcester won the Country Cup from 1889 to 1894. The club again won the Cup in 1897 when Noble Heatlie was captain.\n\nIn 1883 Villagers Rugby club was established and trophies show that by 1893 they even have their own union. They are one of the oldest clubs from the formerly disadvantage communities that played and survived two world wars. Others break up and re-establish decades later and claim back their first establish date. Six players of the club had the honour of wearing the green and gold of SARU. Johnny Neethling, Isak Neethling, Abe Felix, Maurice Hankey, Christy Noble and Charles January. Villagers Worcester won the premier division of the Boland Union in 2012 and represent the union in the first Community Cup Competition of 2013.\nPercy Allport was educated at Worcester and became a Springbok when he represented South Africa in 1910. Allport played at fullback in the last two tests of the series against the fourth English touring side. With the series poised at one win each, the third test at Newlands created more public interest than any other rugby match up to then and for the first time reports in the old newspapers refer to the \"perpetual Newlands roar.\" The highlight of the match was undoubtedly a try scored by Allport. It was to be 45 years before Roy Dryburgh became only the second Springbok fullback in history to score a try in a test.\n\nRichard Robins (Dick) Luyt was born at Ceres and was ranked by his contemporaries as a centre as good as Japie Krige. He had the same uncanny ability to create openings for his teammates and it would seem as if he was South Africa's first hard-tackling centre. Dick Luyt who was a medical doctor settled in Worcester during 1916 and played and captained the Worcester club until 1922.\n\nIn 1931, Schalk du Toit and Alvi van der Merwe were selected to tour with Bennie Osler's Springbok side to the United Kingdom with Van der Merwe playing in the test against Wales. His son Johan became Boland captain and later played for Villagers Worcester. Buks Marais who was educated at Worcester became a Springbok in 1949 when he played in two tests against the All Blacks. He toured with the Springboks to Europe in 1951/52 and played in the test against Scotland. In 1953 he returned to Worcester and again played in the first two tests against the Wallabies. In 1952 the Boland Provincial side played in the Currie Cup final against Transvaal. Steve Hoffman, Johan Naude and Albertus van der Merwe played for the Boland team. Hoffman would become a Springbok in 1953 and Van der Merwe would represent the Springboks in 12 tests from 1955 to 1960.\n\nIn 1969 Mike Jennings was selected to tour with the Springboks to Britain. The tour would become infamous as the \"Demo tour.\" Johan Oosthuizen, born and educated at Worcester, would represent the Springboks in 9 tests from 1974 to 1976. During 1996 the All Blacks played a rugby match on their South African tour, against the Boland Provincial side at Esselen Park.\n\nThe early golfers wore red blazers and long white trousers and played on Church Square during the 1880s. The first Golf Club in Southern Africa was the Royal Cape Golf Club founded in 1885. The Worcester Golf Club was established in 1896 and competition for the Donnison Cup between these two clubs started in 1905.\n\nBy 1892 Izak Meiring, Hennie de Wet and Jas Perkins founded the Mountain Club, the first of its kind in South Africa. Meiring who was a pharmacist and amateur surveyor, confirmed Matroosberg as the highest peak in the Western Province. Meiring's Plateau on the Brandwacht Mountains was named for him. The Worcester Athletic and Cycling Club was founded in 1905, the Swimming Club in 1906 and the Piscatorial Club in 1907.\n\nThe Cape Gliding Club has been based at the Worcester airfield since 1988.\n\n\nThe Council of Breede Valley Municipality who governs the town of Worcester on 29 October 2019 approved that the honourary title of “Freedom of the Town’’ be bestowed on the following exceptional persons who contributed significantly to Worcester and the South African society being:\n1. David Kramer;\n2. Dumile Feni (Posthumous);\n3. Diana Ferrus;\n4. Cecyl Esau;\n5. Professor Raymond Parsons;\n6. Justice Thembile Lewis Skweyiya (Posthumous);\n7. Ayesha (Bibi) Dawood (Posthumous);\n8. Dr Danny Titus; and\n9. Professor John Maxwell Coetze\n\nMunicipality (1) — By 1931, the town council had assumed a coat of arms consisting of a blue shield depicting a golden portcullis on a silver and red torse. The portcullis is the crest of the arms of the Somerset family.\nMunicipality (2) — On 27 September 1948, the council approved a new design, by Ivan Mitford-Barberton and H. Ellis Tomlinson. This was in response to a Cape Provincial Administration circular calling on municipalities to have their arms checked and, if necessary, re-designed to make them heraldically correct. The arms were registered with the provincial administration in May 1957 and at the Bureau of Heraldry in February 1983.\n\nThe arms were : \"Quarterly, Sable and Gules, a portcullis Or, nailed Azure; on a chief wavy Argent, three hurts, on each a fleur-de-lis, Or\" (in layman's terms : a shield quartered in black and red, displaying a golden portcullis with blue nails, above this is a horizontal silver strip with a wavy edge, displaying three golden fleurs de lis on blue discs). The crest was a golden demi-lion holding a cornucopia of fruit. The motto was \"Mutare sperno\". The black and red quartered shield was derived from the arms of the English city of Worcester.\n\nDivisional council (1) — \nBy 1959, the divisional council (the local authority for the rural areas outside the town) had taken over the old discarded municipal arms.\n\nDivisional council (2) — The divisional council had a new coat of arms designed by Cornelis Pama in 1973. It was registered at the Bureau on 29 November 1974.\n\nThe arms were : \"Vert, a bend dancetty Argent in the shape of a letter W between two bezants\" (i.e. a green shield displaying a silver W-shaped stripe between two golden discs). The crest was two bunches of grapes on either side of a stick, and the motto was \"Fructu noscitur\". These arms were re-registered by the council's successor, the Divisional Council of Matroosberg, in April 1980. The latter also had a flag consisting of a banner of the arms.\n\nOn 24 December 1996, Stefaans Coetzee planted a bomb in a christmas tree decoration in a Shoprite shopping centre. Another was placed at a Narutam pharmacy just down the street. The Shoprite bomb ripped through the building killing a woman and 3 children, and further injuring 67 people. The Narutam bomb disinigrated the tree and caused a man nearby to loose one of his legs. On 28 March 2016 that same Shoprite caught ablaze and was heavily damaged.\n\n\n"}

The area is situated entirely within the boundaries of the Pike National Forest.\n\nThe Lost Creek Scenic Area in the Wilderness is a 16,798-acre National Natural Landmark designated site within the Wilderness.\n\nThe area is named for Lost Creek, a perennial stream that disappears and reappears before finally joining Goose Creek which empties into the South Platte River at Cheesman Reservoir just east of the Wilderness area. The entire water system of the area forms a watershed for the Platte River Basin. The area is notable for its many rock formations, natural arches, and rounded granite domes and knobs. These are contained in two ranges of low alpine foothills of the Rocky Mountains: the Kenosha Mountains and the Tarryall Mountains. Bison Peak is the highest peak in the wilderness.\n\nBecause of its proximity to Denver, the area is quite popular for outdoor recreation in both summer and winter months. Typical activities in the area include hiking, backpacking, rock-climbing, as well as cross-country skiing, snowshoeing and winter camping. There are of trails in the wilderness, including a section of the Colorado Trail that crosses Lost Creek then parallels the northeast boundary toward Kenosha Pass.\n\nLost Park, as the area is sometimes called, was one of the last refuges of the American Bison in the United States.\n\nThe Lost Creek Scenic Area is a site in the Lost Creek Wilderness created in 1963, under the 1939 \"U-Regulations\", which was the precursor of the Wilderness Act. It was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1966. It is located in the Pike National Forest and is in both Park and Jefferson counties. Rock formations with pinnacles and spires are located in narrow gorges and on ridges. An underground stream \"disappears and reappears\" nine times or more at the site.\n\nIn the TV series Supernatural, Episode 2 of Season 1 takes place within the Lost Creek Wilderness area, specifically at the fictitious Blackwater Ridge.\n"}

{"id": "2013115", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2013115", "title": "High Rollers", "text": "High Rollers\n\nHigh Rollers is an American television game show that involved contestants trying to win prizes by rolling dice. The format was based on the dice game Shut the Box.\n\n\"High Rollers\" debuted on July 1, 1974, as part of NBC's daytime lineup. In September 1975, an accompanying series was launched in syndication and aired once weekly on local stations. Both of these series ended in 1976, with the daytime series ending on June 11, 1976. Alex Trebek was the host for these series. On April 24, 1978, NBC brought \"High Rollers\" back with Trebek hosting and aired it until June 20, 1980, when it was one of three series cancelled to make room for \"The David Letterman Show\". The series was produced by Heatter-Quigley Productions.\n\nIn 1987, Merrill Heatter, working solo since his production partner Bob Quigley's retirement in 1981, teamed with Orion Television and its subsidiary Century Towers Productions to revive \"High Rollers\" with Wink Martindale as host. This series premiered in daily syndication on September 14, 1987, and aired new episodes until May 27, 1988. Reruns aired until September 9, 1988.\n\nTwo contestants competed. The object was to remove the digits 1 through 9 from a game board by rolling an oversized pair of dice. In order to determine who gained control of the dice, the host asked a toss-up question. The answers were usually multiple choice, true/false, or yes/no. The first contestant to buzz in received the chance to answer, and answering correctly won control. If that contestant did not answer correctly, control went to the opponent.\n\nOnce in control, a contestant could either roll the dice himself/herself or pass them to the opponent. After rolling, the contestant had to remove one or more digits from the board that added up to the total on the dice. For example, if a 10 was rolled, the contestant could remove any available combination that added up to that number: 1-9, 2–8, 3–7, 4–6, 1–2–7, 1–3–6, 1–4–5, 2–3–5, or 1–2–3–4, providing that none of the digits within the combination had already been removed. Contestants banked prizes by removing individual numbers or combinations of them, depending on the rules.\n\nA \"bad roll\" occurred if the total showing on the dice did not correspond with any combination of the digits still in play. A contestant making a bad roll immediately lost the game unless he/she had an insurance marker (see below). A contestant clearing the last digit from the board won the game. The winner of each game received any prizes that were banked, or $100 if no prizes had been banked. The first contestant to win two games won the match and advanced to the Big Numbers bonus round.\n\nThe original series featured a prize or cash amount hidden under every digit on the gameboard, revealed and added to a contestant's bank only when that digit was removed. Two digits each contained one half of a large prize, usually a new car, boat, or a luxury vacation. To bank this prize, both cards had to be uncovered by the same contestant. If the contestants each revealed one of the two cards, the prize was taken out of play for that game.\n\nDuring the final seven weeks of the first daytime version (April 26 – June 11, 1976), the main game was known as \"Face Lifters\". Digits were arranged in a 3×3 grid and concealed a picture of a famous person. A contestant won the game by correctly identifying the person in the picture. A contestant could take a guess after making a good roll. If a contestant made a bad roll, the opponent was allowed one guess for each remaining digit in the picture. A successful guess won the game plus the prizes belonging to the digits still on the board. If neither contestant guessed the identity correctly, Trebek gave clues until one contestant buzzed-in with the answer.\n\nA co-hostess (Ruta Lee, daytime and Elaine Stewart, nighttime) rolled the dice for the contestants. The contestants sat along the long side of the dice table opposite from Trebek. No insurance markers were given in the main game; a bad roll meant an automatic loss.\n\nA syndicated version with almost identical rules ran weekly in 1975–76. Each episode featured the same two contestants competing for the entire show. After the first few episodes the rules were changed so that rather than requiring contestants to win a two-out-of-three match, the winner of each game played the Big Numbers, and the losing contestant returned for another game. The contestants played as many games as possible until time was called. If this happened during a game, the one who had removed more digits won the final game and any prizes accumulated. Under the two-out-of-three game format used in the first few episodes, the contestant also had another chance at the Big Numbers. Like other weekly nighttime game shows at that time, this version had no returning champions.\n\nWhen the series was revived in 1978 (and originally titled \"The New High Rollers\"), the board consisted of three columns with three randomly assigned digits apiece. Each column contained one or more prizes, which were only banked by the contestant who removed the last digit from a column (regardless of who removed the others). The prizes ranged from typical game show gifts (furniture, appliances, trips, etc.) to more unusual items such as a collection of musical dolls or 52 Sunday Kentucky Fried Chicken dinners (a common game show prize of the era). Prizes that were banked but not won during a game were returned to their columns. One new prize was added per column at the beginning of each game, to a maximum of five. When the prizes in a column were won, a new one was placed in that column for the next game.\n\nAt least one column in each game was designated as a \"hot column,\" meaning that all three of its digits could be cleared with a single roll of the dice. Insurance markers could be earned by rolling doubles in the main game. If a contestant made a bad roll while holding a marker, he/she turned it in and rolled again. Making a bad roll without a marker lost the game. Markers earned in the main game did not carry over to the Big Numbers or to the next match.\n\nContestants on this version rolled the dice themselves, instead of having a hostess roll for them.\n\nThis version followed the rules of the 1978–80 version, but with only one prize available in each column. If any prizes were not won during a particular game, they were replaced for the next one. Frequently, one column offered a chance to play a special game if the contestant claimed it and won the round. For the special games described below, only one die was used.\n\n\nThe champion rolled the dice and attempted to remove the digits 1 through 9 from the board, with a large prize awarded for clearing them all. A larger game board was used, except on the 1978–80 series, which used the same board as the main game. Insurance markers were awarded for rolling doubles, with each marker giving the contestant another roll of the dice after making a bad roll. These markers did not carry over to the main game.\n\nContestants were awarded $100 for each digit removed from the board. In the earliest episodes of the 1974–76 version, contestants could stop and take this money after a good roll. A bad roll with no insurance markers, or eliminating all digits except for the 1, ended the game and forfeited the money. The contestant won a car for removing eight digits, and $10,000 for all nine. The rules were soon changed to eliminate the car bonus and allow the contestant to keep any accumulated money even after making a bad roll.\n\nThe 1978–80 version offered three top prizes at different times: a car plus $5,000 cash, the car alone, and the $5,000 alone. The 1987–88 version offered a prize of $10,000 and was played using a pair of gold-colored dice.\n\nThe Big Numbers bonus round was also used on \"Las Vegas Gambit\", which was hosted by future \"High Rollers\" host Wink Martindale and was also produced by Heatter-Quigley Productions, in 1981. The round used the same dice table as the 1978–80 version (complete with sound effects) and had the same rules, but the top award was an accumulating jackpot of prizes known as the Gambit Galaxy.\n\nChampions stayed on the show until they were defeated or until they won five matches (seven on the 1978–80 version). On the 1987–88 version, winning five matches originally won a new car but was later dropped by the time a contestant finally retired undefeated, which led to more cars being awarded in some of the mini-games played during the main game.\n\nAlex Trebek and Wink Martindale served as hosts for \"High Rollers\". Heatter-Quigley staff announcer Kenny Williams served as announcer for the Trebek versions. The 1987 series used Dean Goss as its announcer.\n\nThe 1970s editions of \"High Rollers\" were recorded at NBC's Burbank studio complex while the 1987 series taped at Studio 43 at CBS Television City in Hollywood (though the 1986 pilot was filmed instead at ABC Television Center [now The Prospect Studios]).\n\nActress Ruta Lee and \"Gambit\" card dealer Elaine Stewart were the prize models on the first \"High Rollers\" series, with Lee performing those duties on the daytime series and Stewart the weekly syndicated series. As noted above, both women were also the dice rollers for the contestants. Becky Price, Linda Hooks, and Lauren Firestone rotated as models during the 1978 revival while Martindale was assisted on his version by models Crystal Owens and KC Winkler.\n\nStan Worth composed the theme for the 1974–76 and 1978–80 versions. In 1985, Score Productions composed a theme titled \"Bubble Gum,\" originally for a failed Heatter pilot called \"Lucky Numbers\" (intended as somewhat of a revamp of this show with altered gameplay mechanics), which was reused for the 1987–88 version.\n\nTwo editions of home games were released in 1975, as \"Big Numbers: The High Rollers Game\". The first edition was released by E.S. Lowe, while the second edition was released by Milton Bradley. Both versions have Trebek on the cover. A board game based on the 1987 version was released by Parker Brothers in 1988. The cover shows Martindale and two contestants during a game.\n\nA computer game also based on the 1987 version was released for the Commodore 64, Apple II, and DOS by Box Office in 1988. The cover has Martindale holding a pair of Golden Dice in his left hand while pointing to them with his right.\n\nAn Australian version aired on the Seven Network for a brief period in 1975, hosted by Garry Meadows with Delvene Delaney and Suzanne Fox as the dealers. The announcer was Max Rowley. A Japanese version called \"SuperdiceQ\", hosted by Masaru Doi, aired on TBS (Tokyo Broadcasting System) from 1980 to 1984.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2013123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2013123", "title": "Keukenhof", "text": "Keukenhof\n\nKeukenhof (English: \"Kitchen garden\"; ), also known as the Garden of Europe, is one of the world's largest flower gardens, situated in the town of Lisse, in the Netherlands. According to the official website, Keukenhof Park covers an area of and approximately 7 million flower bulbs are planted in the gardens annually. Keukenhof is widely known for its tulips, it also features numerous other flowers, including hyacinths, daffodils, lilies, roses, carnations and irises.\n\nKeukenhof is located in the province of South Holland, south of Haarlem and southwest of Amsterdam in the area called the \"Dune and Bulb Region\" (Duin- en Bollenstreek). It is accessible by bus from Haarlem and Leiden train stations as well as Schiphol.\n\nThough its grounds are open year-round for private affairs and festivals, Keukenhof is only open to the general public for a world-renown 8 week tulip display from mid-March to mid-May, with peak viewing arriving near mid-April, depending on growing season weather, which varies annually. In 2019, 1.5 million people visited Keukenhof, equivalent to 26,000 visitors per day. By comparison, the Rijksmuseum receives an average of 8000 visitors per day, the Efteling receives 14,000.\n\nKeukenhof is situated on the 15th-century hunting grounds of Slot Teylingen, and was the castle's kitchen garden (in Dutch: keukentuin), providing game, fruit and vegetables. The most noted inhabitant, and beneficiary of the garden was Countess Jacoba van Beieren (1401-1436). In 1638, the estate was purchased by Adriaen Maertensz Block, captain and governor of the VOC. In 1641 he had a large manor house constructed, which he named Keukenhof, now known as Castle Keukenhof.\n\nIn 1857, Baron and Baroness Van Pallandt, at the time owners of the estate, tasked landscape architect Jan David Zocher and his son Louis Paul Zocher, both also designers of Amsterdam's Vondelpark, to restructure the park and grounds around the castle. Those parks, designed in English style, remain the foundations for the gardens.\n\nKeukenhof, the park as it is now known, was established in 1949 by a consortium of bulb growers and flower exporters to showcase their products and support the export industry. The garden opened to the public in 1950 and received 200,000 visitors in its first year. It operates under a charitable foundation of Count Carel De Gaaf van Lynden.\n\nEach fall, 40 gardeners plant the 7 million bulbs, donated to the park by over 100 growers. Planting starts early October and is usually completed by December 5th, around Sinterklaas. The flowerbeds are synchronized to the different bulb flowerings to ensure blooms throughout the duration of park's 8-week opening. To ensure continuous bloom, three bulbs are planted in each location. The shallowest bulb will bloom first for three weeks, followed by the subsequent layers.\n\nIn addition to the tulip gardens, Keukenhof features a variety of other gardens.
