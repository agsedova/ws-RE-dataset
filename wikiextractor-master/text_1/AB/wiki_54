He performed and recorded with Buddy Holly early in Holly's career.\n\nHuddle was born in Paris, Texas into the family of Adrian and Velma Huddle in 1928. Twelve years later he was joined by his only sister, Judith. Even at a young age, Jack loved to sing and play the guitar. Sometimes he played on the air on radio KPLT.\n\nAt age 16, Jack got married. Soon after, he joined the Navy to serve for three years in WWII.\n\nAfter his return to Paris, Jack started playing the bass fiddle in dance bands. His marriage soon broke up and his wife left with their newly born son. Jack was drafted to do his duty in Korea for ten months.\n\nIn 1953, he started working for the brand-new KDUB TV Channel 13, the local branch of CBS. He had a friendly manner and a way with children. He hosted the children's program \"Children's Theater\" every weekday.\n\nOn an evening show once a week called \"Circle 13 Roundup\", Jack was accompanied by a combo and sang popular western hits of the day. On this show he sometimes teamed up with Charlene Hancock, the wife of Tommy Hancock. Tommy was the owner of the infamous Cotton Club in Lubbock where Elvis and Little Richard performed. Also Clyde Hankins was asked by Jack to join him now and then. Clyde worked at the Adair musicstore in Lubbock and was known for selling Buddy Holly his first Fender Stratocaster. He also taught Buddy how to play the guitar and widened Buddy's view into musical styles other than country, especially jazz.\n\nIn 1953 Jack gave a young Buddy Holly a break when he let him perform with his friend Jack Neal as the Buddy & Jack duo on the talentshow \"Around Lubbock.\" For a short stint Jack even hosted a Grand Ole Opry-style show called the \"G.E. Jamboree.\" In those years at KDUB Jack became widely known in the West Texas area and played lots of gigs.\n\nOn April 28, 1957, Jack made the trip to Clovis, New Mexico, together with his friend and writing partner Jim Robinson. Buddy Holly was also there or was asked by Jack to go with him. Buddy played lead guitar on the recordings made that day: \"Starlight\" and \"Believe Me\". The instrumental break on \"Starlight\" was often considered as one of the most catchy guitar breaks by Buddy on a non-Buddy or non-Crickets record. The session was kicked off by Jim Robinson (Jimmie Zed Robinson) singing \"Whole Lot of Lovin'\" and \"It's a Wonderful Feeling.\" After that it was Huddle's turn. Jack and Jim recorded two other songs in Clovis in 1959. \"Midnight Monsters Hop\" and \"Tarzan and Jane\". Buddy didn't play on them. Jack and Jim also wrote \"Frankie Frankenstein\" that was recorded in Clovis and sung by Jerry Allison, Buddy Holly's drummer.\n\nAround 1959 Jack moved to Houston. There he kept playing gigs and started working as a sales manager for a valve company.\n\nIn 1973, Huddle died of a heart attack at the age of 45. His grave is located in Paris, Texas.\n\n"}

Part of the song (\"Your ballroom days are over, baby/Night is drawing near/Shadows of the evening/crawl across the years\"), was seemingly lifted from the 19th-century hymnal and bedtime rhyme \"Now the Day Is Over\" (\"Now the day is over/Night is drawing nigh/Shadows of the evening/Steal across the sky\") by Morrison. Similarly, Morrison quoted the \"Christian child's prayer\" in a live version of Soul Kitchen sung in 1969 and also altered the children's rhyme \"Jack be nimble, Jack be quick, Jack jump over The candlestick\" to suit part of his poem \"An American Prayer\" (\"Words dissemble/Words be quick/Words resemble walking sticks\").\n\nThe song's most famous performance was at the 1969 Miami concert at the Dinner Key Auditorium. Towards the end of the performance, a drunken Morrison declared the audience \"idiots\" and \"slaves\". The concert would end with Morrison being accused of \"attempting to incite a riot\" among the concert goers, resulting in his arrest, and later conviction, for indecent exposure. This performance can be heard on Disc 1 of \"\" and is depicted in Oliver Stone's film \"The Doors\".\n\nDuring the reunion of the original lineup of the Doors sans Jim Morrison on \"VH1 Storytellers\", Scott Weiland of Stone Temple Pilots took up vocals. Before the performance Robby Krieger said Weiland was one of the few frontmen who could \"fill Jim's leather pants\". Scott said that \"Five to One\" was what inspired him to begin a career in rock music.\n\nThe guitar solo on Pearl Jam's \"Alive\" was based on Ace Frehley's guitar solo on the Kiss song \"She\", which was in turn based on Robby Krieger's solo in \"Five to One\". Rapper Jay-Z sampled \"Five to One\" as the beat for his diss song of Nas and Mobb Deep called \"Takeover\".\n\n"}

Allison\n\nGraham Tillett Allison Jr. (born March 23, 1940) is an American political scientist and professor at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. He is renowned for his contribution in the late 1960s and early 1970s to the bureaucratic analysis of decision making, especially during times of crisis. His book \"Remaking Foreign Policy: The Organizational Connection\", co-written with Peter Szanton, was published in 1976 and had some influence on the foreign policy of the administration of President Jimmy Carter who took office in early 1977. Since the 1970s, Allison has also been a leading analyst of U.S. national security and defense policy, with a special interest in nuclear weapons and terrorism.\n\nAllison is from Charlotte, North Carolina. He attended Davidson College for two years, then graduated from Harvard University in 1962 with an B.A. degree. Allison then completed a two-year B.A. degree at Oxford University as a Marshall Scholar in 1964 and returned to Harvard to earn a Ph.D. degree in political science in 1968. In 1979 Allison received an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Social Sciences at Uppsala University, Sweden.\n\nAllison has spent his entire academic career at Harvard, as an assistant professor (1968), associate professor (1970), then full professor (1972) in the department of government. He was dean of the John F. Kennedy School of Government from 1977 to 1989 while the School increased in size by 400% and its endowment increased by 700%. He was director for the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs from 1995 until 2017, when he was succeeded by former Secretary of Defense Ash Carter. Allison remains Douglas Dillon Professor of Government.\n\nAllison has also been a fellow of the Center for Advanced Studies (1973–74); consultant for the RAND Corporation; member of the Council on Foreign Relations; member of the visiting committee on foreign policy studies at the Brookings Institution (1972–77); and a member of the Trilateral Commission (1974–84 and 2018). He was among those mentioned to succeed David Rockefeller as President of the Council on Foreign Relations. In 2009 he was awarded the NAS Award for Behavior Research Relevant to the Prevention of Nuclear War from the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nAllison has been heavily involved in U.S. defense policy since working as an advisor and consultant to the Pentagon in the 1960s. He has been a member of the Secretary of Defense's Defense Policy Board from 1985. He was a special advisor to the Secretary of Defense (1985–87) and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Policy and Plans (1993–1994), where he coordinated strategy and policy towards the states of the former Soviet Union. President Bill Clinton awarded Allison the Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service, for \"reshaping relations with Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan to reduce the former Soviet nuclear arsenal\". He was also an informal advisor to Michael Dukakis's 1988 presidential campaign.\n\nAllison is best known as a political scientist for his book \"Essence of Decision: Explaining the Cuban Missile Crisis\" (1971), in which he developed two new theoretical paradigms – an organizational process model and a bureaucratic politics model – to compete with the then-prevalent approach of understanding foreign policy decision-making using a rational actor model. \"Essence of Decision\" swiftly revolutionized the study of decision-making in political science and beyond.\n\nIn the book \"Destined for War\", Allison uses the phrase the Thucydides Trap which, according to him, refers to the theory that \"when one great power threatens to displace another, war is almost always the result\". Allison's term follows the ancient text \"History of the Peloponnesian War\", in which Thucydides wrote, \"What made war inevitable was the growth of Athenian power and the fear which this caused in Sparta.\" The term appeared in a paid opinion advertisement in \"The New York Times\" on April 6, 2017, on the occasion of U.S. President Donald Trump's meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, which stated, \"Both major players in the region share a moral obligation to steer away from Thucydides's Trap.\" Allison asserts that circumstances at the start of World War I (involving British fears about Germany); and the War of the Spanish Succession, and the Thirty Years' War, (involving French insecurity about the Habsburg empires of Spain and Austria) exhibit the trap.\n\nSinologist Arthur Waldron has criticized the concept of the Thucydides Trap and Allison's application of it to US–China relations. In March 2019, the \"Journal of Chinese Political Science\" dedicated a special issue to the topic, suggesting power transition narratives do appear to matter with regard to domestic perception.\n\n\nFrom 2012 to 2013, the Belfer Center (through the Wikimedia Foundation) paid an editor to cite Allison's scholarly writings in various articles. Funding for the position came from the Stanton Foundation, for which Graham Allison's wife, Liz Allison, was one of two trustees. The editor also made \"supposedly problematic edits\" based heavily on work of other scholars affiliated with the Belfer Center.\n\n\n\n\n"}

With dyslexia, she left Lord Williams's Grammar School in Thame without qualifications, but later attended lectures at Oxford while working as a cleaner in the city.\n\nIn 1981, aged 23, Tewson founded Charity Projects in London, with funding from Lord (Tim) Bell and numerous other donations. Its initial focus was tackling homelessness in Soho.\n\nTewson had worked in a refugee camp in Sudan in 1985, where she was pronounced clinically dead after contracting cerebral malaria. She recounts the sensation of looking down on her own body and but then returning to it and surviving – there were no drugs left in the camp. Her response to the African famine, Comic Relief was launched on Christmas Day 1985 from the refugee camp in Safawa, Sudan. By 2005 Comic Relief had raised £337 million for famine relief and community development, notably for Africa and disadvantaged areas of the UK.\n\nIn 2000, Tewson moved to Melbourne, Australia, when her husband, Charles Lane, became CEO of the Myer Foundation, a philanthropic organization and then the Dept. of Victorian Communities. At the time she was suffering from ovarian cancer but survived after operations in Melbourne.\n\nTewson works on some inner city Melbourne projects, and elsewhere, through Igniting Change (formerly Pilotlight Australia). The book \"Change the World for Ten Bucks\" was published and German and British editions have also been released. The \"Dying to Know\" project and book (2009) is about coming to terms with death, and negotiating grief.\n\nTewson is known for her approach to charitable works and giving - she believes in making charity \"active, emotional, involving and fun\", by building connections between people of different backgrounds, cultures, wealth, and social positions. Her approach argues for \"people getting directly involved and giving themselves...\", as with the Timebank concept, rather than giving money for charitable works. This \"embraces human connection as a vital part of social change\".\n\nConcepts she pioneered include:\n\n\n\n"}

Later, when Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon was having a birthday party, Jeffords called Lott and suggested that the four of them sing at the party. Mack declined, but Larry Craig joined. According to his autobiography, \"Herding Cats, A Life in Politics\", Lott formed the group in large part to improve relations between the Republican Conference, of which Lott was Majority Leader, and Jeffords, a Republican who frequently voted with the Democrats.\n\nDuring the initial years, the four Senators usually practiced in Lott's hideaway office. Guy Hovis, the Mississippi state director for Lott, was a talented musician who gave the Senators some training. They all practiced together every day.\n\nTheir first official performance of the group was in October 1995 for the American Council of Young Political Leaders (ACYPL), in which they sang \"Elvira\" at a fundraising event at the Kennedy Center organized by Ray Ivey of Consolidated Natural Gas. In December 1995, the group appeared on \"The Today Show\".\n\nIn April 1996, the Oak Ridge Boys sang with the group at a Senate reception, something described in \"The Hill\", a Capitol Hill newspaper, as \"Congressional Harmony\". In September 1996 the group performed again with the Oak Ridge Boys in Branson, Missouri. The same year, the senators sang at the 1996 Republican National Convention.\n\nIn 1998 the group released their only album, \"Let Freedom Sing\", a ten-song CD recorded in Nashville. In 2000, clips of the group's songs could be streamed from the Senate pages of Ashcroft and Jeffords.\n\nIn November 2000, Ashcroft lost his Senate re-election race (he was appointed Attorney General in early 2001). In May 2001, Jeffords announced he was leaving the Republican Party to become an Independent, returning control of the Senate to the Democrats. The two events, combined, led to the apparent demise of the group.\n\nIn October 2006, Singing Senators Lott and Craig said they were putting the quartet back together after a six-year hiatus. They said they had found two solid prospects in Senators Bob Bennett (R-Utah) and John Thune (R-S.D.)\n\nIn June 2007, Singing Senators Ashcroft, Craig, and Lott gave their first public performance in more than six years. Senator Craig was subsequently inducted into the Idaho Hall of Fame, having been selected in March 2007. Craig said that the group was now a trio. Lott's announced resignation in 2007 seemed to put the existence of even a trio in doubt. Craig's decision to not run for another term in 2008—due in part to the controversy over his arrest for solicitation the previous year—spelled the formal end of the group.\n\n"}
{"id": "1982545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982545", "title": "Ex-Cubs Factor", "text": "Ex-Cubs Factor\n\nThe Ex-Cubs Factor (or Ex-Cub Factor) is a seemingly spurious correlation that was seen as essentially a corollary to the Curse of the Billy Goat. Widely published in the 1990s, the hypothesis asserted that since the appearance by the Chicago Cubs in the 1945 World Series, any baseball team headed into the World Series with three or more former Cubs on its roster has \"a critical mass of Cubness\" and a strong likelihood of failure.\n\nThe theory was developed in October 15, 1981 by Ron Berler, a freelance journalist and Cubs fan. Berler posited in an article that \"it is utterly impossible for a team with three or more ex-Cubs to win the series.\" Berler based this on a pattern that he observed in the post-1945 era; 1945 being the last time the Chicago Cubs made it to a World Series until 2016.\n\nBerler cited many examples of teams with three or more ex-Cubs on their teams that reached the World Series and lost: including the 1958 Milwaukee Braves, the 1966 Los Angeles Dodgers, and the 1978 Los Angeles Dodgers. The 1978 Dodgers, according to Berler, had lost the 1977 World Series with three ex-Cubs on their roster and seemed to be doing well the next season when they traded one of those ex-Cubs (Mike Garman) away and began playing excellently. However, four weeks later, the Dodgers traded for ex-Cub Bill North and, in the words of Berler, the \"team suffered an immediate tailspin and barely beat Cincinnati to the pennant.\" The 1978 Dodgers lost the World Series to the Yankees leading to Berler's hypothesis of three ex-Cubs making it impossible to win a championship. In addition, the 1980 Kansas City Royals lost the World Series as well with 3 ex-Cubs.\n\nIn the original article, Berler predicted that based on this pattern the 1981 New York Yankees would not win the World Series because they had five ex-Cubs on their roster (Oscar Gamble, Bobby Murcer, Dave LaRoche, Rick Reuschel, and Barry Foote), this prediction went against the odds which heavily favored the Yankees at the time. His prediction about the 1981 World Series based on this hypothesis was proved correct with the Yankees losing to the Dodgers, four games to two.\n\nBerler relates the relationship to the inherent \"cubness\" that ex-Cubs take to their future teams. In the original article, he wrote that \"the ballclub possesses eerie, bewitching powers over its players\" and that \"'Cubness'...is synonymous with the rankest sort of abject failure, and is a condition chronic among all Cubs, past and present.\"\n\nMike Royko, who popularized the term in his columns in Chicago, wrote that cubness was a \"virus\" where \"Three or more ex-Cubs could infect an entire team with the will to lose, no matter how skillful that team might appear.\" Berler adopted a similar explanation in later articulations, writing that the virus \"attacks all who've played for the Cubs, even if only for a single day. There is no inoculation, no cure. When traded to another team, ex-Cubs become carriers of this debilitating disease—the ticks of baseball. Any World Series team infested with three or more of them turns addled and confused, losing all ability to win.\"\n\nMike Royko developed an additional hypothesis contending that \"A team with no ex-Cubs probably has the edge on a team that has even one.\" The key evidence provided for this was the 1986 World Series which had the New York Mets (with no ex-Cubs) defeat the Boston Red Sox (with a dramatic error by ex-Cub Bill Buckner). This hypothesis was largely discredited in the 2003 World Series with the Florida Marlins (who had ex-Cub Lenny Harris) defeating the New York Yankees (who had no ex-Cubs), though Harris did not play in the World Series.\n\nSince 1945, of the 23 teams to reach the World Series with three or more Cubs players, only 3 have won the World Series (the 1960 Pirates, the 2001 Diamondbacks, and the 2008 Phillies). Since its articulation in 1981, the Ex-Cubs Factor has been used to predict and explain post-season and World Series defeats for many different baseball teams.\n\nDuring the 1980s, the ex-Cubs factor was used to explain a number of losses by teams. It was used, in a letter to the editor, as a reason for the loss by the San Diego Padres (who ironically beat the Cubs to get to the Series) in the 1984 World Series (with three ex-Cubs) and by the collapse of the 1985 Toronto Blue Jays who had added ex-Cub Cliff Johnson on August 28 and then blew a 3-1 lead over the Royals in the 1985 American League Championship Series.\n\nWhile not falling under the curse in the traditional sense, Bill Buckner's infamous gaffe in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series can be interpreted to fit the Ex-Cubs Factor. Buckner, a former Cub, booted a ground ball hit by New York Mets batter Mookie Wilson, allowing Ray Knight to come around and score the winning run. The Mets would go on to win the series in seven games, and Buckner would never win the World Series in his career. Upon video analysis, Buckner was shown to be wearing a Cubs batting glove under his mitt when he made the error.\n\nThe theory became more prominent in 1990 when it was popularized by syndicated \"Chicago Tribune\" columnist Mike Royko and continued predictions by Ron Berler. On October 16, 1990, Berler again asserted the ex-Cubs factor as the reason that the favored Oakland Athletics (with ex-Cubs Scott Sanderson, Dennis Eckersley, and Ron Hassey) would lose in the 1990 World Series (which they did by getting swept by the Cincinnati Reds). It was again cited by Berler as a reason for the defeat of the league-leading 1991 Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1991 National League Championship Series to the Atlanta Braves. Mike Royko used the ex-Cubs factor to predict the playoff collapse of the 104-win 1993 Atlanta Braves (which did occur in the 1993 National League Championship Series).\n\nThe ex-Cubs factor hypothesis was used to predict the San Francisco Giants (with three ex-Cubs Shawon Dunston, Benito Santiago and Tim Worrell) loss to the Anaheim Angels in the 2002 World Series.\n\nThe ex-Cubs factor hypothesis has also been used to explain the results of the 2004 American League Championship Series (ALCS) and the 2004 World Series, both won by the Boston Red Sox. In the 2004 ALCS, the Yankees (with six ex-Cubs) lost a 3-0 game lead to the Boston Red Sox, the first time in Major League Baseball history. The Red Sox (with only two ex-Cubs) then went on to defeat the St. Louis Cardinals (with three ex-Cubs) in the World Series. The 2009 World Series resulted in a win by the New York Yankees (with two ex-Cubs) over the Philadelphia Phillies (with three ex-Cubs).\n\nBerler's study of the ex-Cub factor since 1945 revealed only one exception since 1945: the 1960 Pittsburgh Pirates, who won the World Series with three ex-Cubs on their roster. Berler contends that one of those ex-Cubs, Don Hoak, spent so little time in Chicago, that he did not fully develop what Berler called his \"Cubness\". Berler quoted pitcher Jim Brosnan as saying that \"Hoak is quite possibly the only man who ever conquered his Cubness\".\n\nThe 2001 Arizona Diamondbacks similarly had four ex-Cubs on their roster (Miguel Batista, Mark Grace, Mike Morgan, and Luis Gonzalez) but defeated the New York Yankees in the 2001 World Series. Mark Grace declared in an post-game interview that \"We beat the ex-Cub Factor!\". The sympathy many fans felt for New York City following the September 11 attacks, topped off by the four ex-Cubs on the Arizona roster, seemed to stack up against the Diamondbacks. But Arizona won Game 6 in a lopsided score, and then won Game 7 in a come-from-behind finish, scoring a pair of runs in the ninth inning to win the Series. In fact, two of the four former Cubs played prominent roles in that ninth inning, Mark Grace getting a lead off single and Luis Gonzalez driving in the winning run with a single.\n\nThe 1960 Pittsburgh Pirates and the 2001 Arizona Diamondbacks (both with victories over the New York Yankees) are one of the few teams that have won the World Series in Game 7 walk-off victories.\n\nThe 2008 Philadelphia Phillies team was declared prior to the post-season by Berler as \"doomed this year by the Ex-Cub Factor\" (with three ex-Cubs Scott Eyre, Jamie Moyer, and Matt Stairs on their roster). However, the Phillies defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers (a team also with three ex-Cubs) in the National League Championship Series and the Tampa Bay Rays (one ex-Cub) in the 2008 World Series.\n\nThe Ex-Cubs Factor hypothesis has been applied to other professional baseball teams in both positive and negative references. For example, sports writer Jeff Blair has argued there exists an \"ex-Expos factor\" where number of former Montreal Expos players correlates with post-season success. Jim Caple for ESPN.com has similarly proposed an ex-Mariners factor (or XMF) which explores the excellent play by ex-Mariners for other teams in postseason baseball.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1982557", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982557", "title": "Stonnall", "text": "Stonnall\n\nStonnall is a large village in Staffordshire, England, close to Shenstone, Brownhills, Walsall Wood and Aldridge. It is divided into Upper Stonnall, Stonnall and Lower Stonnall — Upper Stonnall partly lies in the Metropolitan Borough of Walsall; the remainder of the village is in the district of Lichfield.\n\nThe village is closely associated with the hamlets of Hilton, Lynn and Thornes. It has a population of 1,546 residents.\n\nThere are two possibilities or there may have been two dialectal forms.\n\nThe name Stonnall may be derived from the Anglo-Saxon words \"stan\" and \"halh\", meaning \"stony nook of land\".\n\nHowever, in the medieval pipe rolls, the alternative \"Stonwal\" is given alongside the more familiar form. In this case, the second element may be Anglo-Saxon \"waelle\", giving a meaning of a \"stony and watery place\". It is certainly true that the area has been historically prone to flooding.\n\nBronze Age activity in the area is attested by the discovery of the Stonnall Hoard at Gainsborough Farm in 1824. The items recovered included 22 bronze, copper and lead artefacts.\n\nIron Age activity in the area is attested by the hill fort at Castle Old Fort, otherwise known locally as \"the Castles\" or \"Stonnall Hill Fort\". The fort was probably constructed by the Celtic tribe, the Cornovii.\n\nIn the 12th century, Stonnall together with the rest of the Parish of Shenstone was given to Osney Abbey by Baron Robert D'Oyly, the high constable of Oxford. Stonnall remained in the hands of the abbey until the Reformation.\n\nAfter the Reformation, much of the land was in the ownership of the Manor of Shenstone based at Little Aston Hall.\n\nIn the late Middle Ages, Stonnall was a staging point on the coach route between London and Chester. The Welsh Harp and the Swan Inn provided service to travellers on Old Chester Road.\n\nIn the early 19th century, under the direction of the Church of England and with the assistance of the manor, a very highly detailed tithe map of the Parish of Shenstone was produced, along with a book of awards that was signed off by John Mellor, the estate manager at Little Aston Hall. These documents are extant and kept in a county records office.\n\nSt Peter's Chapel of Ease was built in 1822 and consecrated on 23 January 1823. Some years later, Stonnall became an ecclesiastic parish in its own right and the chapel was consequently designated as a fully-fledged parish church. Its first minister was Rev James Downes BA, who was the incumbent until his death in 1893.\n\nWilliam Tennant, Lord of the Manor of Shenstone, gave the land on which the church is situated along with £100 towards the construction of the building. Robert Peel of Tamhorn gave a further £60. A total of £623/19s/0d was raised from public subscriptions. John Mellor took on the role as clerk of works as building began.\n\nWilliam Tennant also provided land for the construction of the National School, Stonnall's first educational establishment. This served the village and surrounding area until 1874 when St Peter's School was opened.\n\nStonnall was part of Lichfield Rural District until 1 April 1974, when local government was reorganised following the Local Government Act 1972.\n\nAs a constituent part of the civil parish of Shenstone, the village elects members to Shenstone Parish Council.\n\nAs far as higher local government is concerned, the village is divided between two local authorities. The division of the village that is to the west of Chester Road is part of the metropolitan borough of Walsall.\n\nTo the east of the road, Stonnall is part of the District of Lichfield. Liz Hassall and Joseph Powell are the currently elected to Lichfield District Council.\n\nStonnall is part of Lichfield Rural South ward of Staffordshire County Council. David Smith is the current county councillor for that ward.\n\nStonnall is within the parliamentary constituency of Tamworth. The current member of parliament is Christopher Pincher.\n\nWordsley House, which is located in upper Main Street (originally a part of Old Chester Road), is the former public house and inn known as the Welsh Harp. This was for many years one of the staging posts on the coach route between London and Chester.\n\nThe Manor House at Lazy Hill was built by Rowland Fryth of Thornes Hall in the early 18th century and was the former public house and inn known as the Swan Inn. Originally, it was built to compete with the Welsh Harp for coaching route business.\n\nStonnall has a small collection of shops, two public houses, a village hall and St Peter's C of E Primary School. There are also many residential buildings and some farm buildings, with the Sandhills water pumping station, owned by South Staffordshire Water, located just outside the village. There is also a park and the Youth and Community Centre.\n\nStonnall features an isolated beech tree on top of Grove Hill. Known as the \"Stonnall Tree\", it has been the cause of endless fascination and speculation for over a hundred years and has become a village icon.\n\nPen Brook rises at the Fox Covey on Castle Hill and flows through Stonnall Gorse and alongside Lazy Hill Road where it then enters a series of culverts at Chester Road. The brook is visible on the eastern side of the playing fields and again where it emerges from the last culvert at the Wall Heath fields.\n\nUpper Stonnall had a bus service operated by Central Buses. The route was numbered 35B and ran between Walsall and Lichfield via Aldridge, Stonnall and Shentone. The route operated every 2 hours Monday to Saturday.\n\nThis bus has since been withdrawn and now a new bus service, 36 which has been slashed from Walsall to Aldridge.

{"id": "1982558", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982558", "title": "Tangut language", "text": "Tangut language\n\nTangut (Tangut: ; ) is an ancient northeastern Tibeto-Burman language once spoken in the Western Xia, also known as the Tangut Empire. It is classified by some linguists as a Qiangic language, which includes the Northern and Southern Qiang languages and the Rgyalrong languages, among others.\n\nTangut was one of the official languages of the Western Xia (known in Tibetan as \"Mi nyag\" and in Chinese as 彌藥 Míyào), which was founded by the Tangut people and obtained its independence from the Song dynasty at the beginning of the 11th century. The Western Xia were annihilated when Genghis Khan invaded in 1226.\n\nThe Tangut language has its own script, the Tangut script.\n\nThe latest known text written in the Tangut language, the Tangut dharani pillars, dates to 1502, suggesting that the language was still in use nearly three hundred years after the destruction of the Tangut people.\n\nModern research into the Tangut languages began in the late 19th century and early 20th century when S. W. Bushell, Gabriel Devéria, and Georges Morisse separately published decipherments of a number of Tangut characters found on Western Xia coins, in a Chinese-Tangut bilingual inscription on a stele at Wuwei, Gansu, and in a copy of the Tangut translation of the Lotus Sutra.\n\nThe majority of extant Tangut texts were excavated at Khara-Khoto in 1909 by Pyotr Kozlov, and the script was identified as that of the Tangut state of Xixia. Such scholars as Aleksei Ivanovich Ivanov, Ishihama Juntaro (石濱純太郎), Berthold Laufer, Luo Fuchang (羅福萇), Luo Fucheng (羅福成), and Wang Jingru (王靜如) have contributed to research on the Tangut language. The most significant contribution was made by the Russian scholar Nikolai Aleksandrovich Nevsky (1892–1937), who compiled the first Tangut Dictionary and reconstructed the meaning of a number of Tangut grammatical particles, thus making it possible to actually read and understand Tangut texts. His scholarly achievements were published posthumously in 1960 under the title \"Tangutskaya Filologiya\" (Tangut Philology) and the scholar was eventually (and posthumously) awarded the Soviet Lenin Prize for his work. The understanding of the Tangut language is far from perfect: although certain aspects of the morphology (Ksenia Kepping, \"The Morphology of the Tangut Language\", Moscow: Nauka, 1985) and grammar (Tatsuo Nishida, \"Seika go no kenkyū\", etc.) are understood, the syntactic structure of Tangut remains largely unexplored.\n\nThe Khara-Khoto documents are at present preserved in the Institute of Oriental Manuscripts of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg. These survived the Siege of Leningrad, but a number of manuscripts in the possession of Nevsky at the time of his arrest by the NKVD in 1937 went missing, and were returned, under mysterious circumstances, to the Institute of Oriental Manuscripts only in October 1991. The collections amount to about 10,000 volumes, of mostly Buddhist texts, law codes and legal documents dating from mid-11th up to early 13th centuries. Among the Buddhist texts a number of unique compilations, not known either in Chinese or in Tibetan versions, were recently discovered. Furthermore, the Buddhist canon, the Chinese classics, and a great number of indigenous texts written in Tangut have been preserved. These other major Tangut collections, though much smaller in size, belong to the British Library, the National Library in Beijing, the Library of Beijing University and other libraries.\n\nThe connection between the writing and the pronunciation of the Tangut language is even more tenuous than that between Chinese writing and the modern Chinese varieties. Thus although in Chinese more than 90% of the characters possess a phonetic element, this proportion is limited to about 10% in Tangut according to Sofronov. The reconstruction of Tangut pronunciation must resort to other sources.\n\nThe discovery of the \"Pearl in the Palm\", a Tangut-Chinese bilingual glossary, permitted Ivanov (1909) and Laufer (1916) to propose initial reconstructions and to undertake the comparative study of Tangut. This glossary in effect indicates the pronunciation of each Tangut character with one or several Chinese characters, and inversely each Chinese character with one or more Tangut characters. The second source is the corpus of Tibetan transcriptions of Tangut. These data were studied for the first time by Nevsky (Nevskij) (1925).\n\nNonetheless, these two sources were not in themselves sufficient for a systematic reconstruction of Tangut. In effect, these transcriptions were not written with the intention of representing with precision the pronunciation of Tangut, but instead simply to help foreigners to pronounce and memorize the words of one language with the words of another which they could understand.\n\nThe third source, which constitutes the basis of the modern reconstructions, consists of monolingual Tangut dictionaries: the \"Wenhai\" (文海), two editions of the \"Tongyin\" (同音), the \"Wenhai zalei\" (文海雜類) and an untitled dictionary. The record of the pronunciation in these dictionaries is made using the principle of \"fǎnqiè\", borrowed from the Chinese lexicographic tradition. Although these dictionaries may differ on small details (e.g. the \"Tongyin\" categorizes the characters according to syllable initial and rime without taking any account of tone), they all adopt the same system of 105 rimes. A certain number of rimes are in complementary distribution with respect to the place of articulation of the initials, e.g. rimes 10 and 11 or rimes 36 and 37, which shows that the scholars who composed these dictionaries had made a very precise phonological analysis of their language.\n\nIn distinction to the transcription in foreign languages, the Tangut \"fanqie\" makes distinctions among the rhymes in a systematic and very precise manner. Due to the \"fǎnqiè\", we now have a good understanding of the phonological categories of the language. Nonetheless, it is necessary to compare the phonological system of the dictionaries with the other sources in order to \"fill in\" the categories with a phonetic value.\n\nN. A. Nevsky reconstructed Tangut grammar and provided the first Tangut–Chinese–English–Russian dictionary, which together with the collection of his papers was published posthumously in 1960 under the title \"Tangut Philology\" (Moscow: 1960). Later, substantial contribution to the research of Tangut language was done by , Ksenia Kepping, Gong Hwang-cherng (龔煌城), M.V. Sofronov and Li Fanwen (李範文). Marc Miyake has published on Tangut phonology and diachronics. There are four Tangut dictionaries available: the one composed by N.A. Nevsky, one composed by Nishida (1966), one composed by Li Fanwen (1997, revised edition 2008) and one composed by Yevgeny Kychanov (2006).\n\nThere is growing a school of Tangut studies in China. Leading scholars include Shi Jinbo (史金波), Li Fanwen, Nie Hongyin (聶鴻音), Bai Bin (白濱) in mainland China, and Gong Hwang-cherng and Lin Ying-chin (林英津) in Taiwan. In other countries, leading scholars in the field include Yevgeny Kychanov and his student K. J. Solonin in Russia, Nishida Tatsuo and in Japan, and Ruth W. Dunnell in the United States.\n\nThe Tangut syllable has a CV structure and carries one of two distinctive tones, flat or rising. Following the tradition of Chinese phonological analysis the Tangut syllable is divided into initial (声母) and rhyme (韻母) (i.e. the remaining syllable minus the initial).\n\nThe consonants are divided into the following categories:\n\nThe rhyme books distinguish 105 rhyme classes, which are, in turn, classified in several ways:/grade (等), type (環), and class (攝).\n\nTangut rhymes occur in three types (環). They are seen in the tradition of Nishida, followed by both Arakawa and Gong as 'normal' (普通母音), 'tense' (緊候母音), and 'retroflex' (捲舌母音). Gong leaves normal vowels unmarked and places a dot under tense vowels and an -r after retroflex vowels. Arakawa differs only by indicating tense vowels with a final -q.\n\nThe rhyme books distinguish four vowel grades (等). In early phonetic reconstructions, all four were separately accounted for, but it has since been realized that grades three and four are in complementary distribution, depending on the initial. Consequently, the reconstructions of Arakawa and Gong do not account for this distinction. Gong represents these three grades as V, iV, and jV. Arakawa accounts for them as V, iV, and V.\n\nIn general rhyme class (攝), corresponds to the set of all rhymes under the same rhyme type which have the same main vowel.\n\nGong further posits phonemic vowel length and points to evidence that indicates that Tangut had a distinction that Chinese lacked. There is no certainty that the distinction was vowel length and so other researchers have remained skeptical.\n\nMiyake reconstructs the vowels differently. In his reconstruction, the 95 vowels of Tangut formed from a six-vowel system in Pre-Tangut because of preinitial loss. (The two vowels in parentheses appeared only in loanwords from Chinese, and many of the vowels in class III were in complementary distribution with their equivalents in class IV.)\nThe classes here is related to those of Chinese rime tables.\n\n\n"}

The son of Edmund Clerihew Bentley (inventor of the clerihew verse form), he was given the name Nicholas, but opted to change the spelling.\n\nNicholas Clerihew Bentley was born on 14 June 1907 at Highgate in London. He was educated at University College School where he left at the age of 17, having decided that his academic abilities would not take him to university. He then enrolled at Heatherleys School of Fine Art, a prestigious private college, but left after a few months. After leaving Heatherley's, Bentley worked without pay as a clown in a circus. When this job ended, he was a film extra; and during the General Strike of 1926 he worked on the London Underground.\n\nIt was at this time that Bentley sold his first drawing to his godfather, G. K. Chesterton. He had a commission to draw illustrations for a trade newspaper called \"Man and his clothes\" in 1928, and his first regular job as an illustrator was in the publicity department of Shell. Bentley worked for Shell for three years, but disliked working in advertising. In 1930, Hilaire Belloc (who was a friend of his father) invited him to illustrate his book \"New Cautionary Tales\". The good critical reception of this book and its illustrations allowed him to go freelance.\n\nAs well as becoming a freelance artist, writer and journalist, Bentley also followed a career in publishing. From 1950 he was director of Andre Deutsch. He later worked as an editor for Mitchell Beazley Ltd; for Sunday Times Publications from 1962 to 1963; and for Thomas Nelson from 1963 to 1967.\n\nDuring the 1930s Bentley illustrated works ranging from J. B. Morton to Damon Runyon. His most famous drawings were to illustrate T. S. Eliot's \"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats\", but he illustrated more than 70 books in the course of a long career. He customarily used the byline \"Nicolas Bentley drew the pictures\". His favourite illustration work was for his own books and he considered himself primarily an author. One of his best-known books, \"Ready Refusals, or, The White Liar's Engagement Book\" gives a quotation for every day of the year, drawn from a surprisingly wide range of sources, together with an appropriate illustration. He also wrote and illustrated \"Golden Sovereigns – and some of lesser value – from Boadicea to Elizabeth II\" (1970), a humorous book about the English/British monarchy.\n\nOn 17 October 1934, he married Barbara Hastings (1908–1989), a writer of children's books and the daughter of Sir Patrick Gardiner Hastings; they had one child, Arabella, in 1943.\n\nBentley had enrolled as an auxiliary fireman in 1938 and served in the London Fire Brigade during the Second World War. He illustrated \"How to be an Alien\" (1946) by George Mikes.\n\nAfter the war he took a few regular cartooning jobs, including on \"Time and Tide\" (1952–54) and drawing pocket cartoons for the \"Daily Mail\" from 1958. He gave this job up in 1962, complaining that it put too much strain on him. In later life he was the illustrator for Auberon Waugh's Diary in \"Private Eye\" and contributed other cartoons to the magazine.\n\nHe moved to Downhead, near Shepton Mallet in Somerset. He died on 14 August 1978, in the Royal United Hospital, Bath, Somerset.\n\nHis autobiography, \"A Version of the Truth\", was published in 1960. On his death, Auberon Waugh wrote in \"Private Eye\": \"Nick was a gentle, modest, humorous man, with none of the usual characteristics of the highly individual genius which inspired his quiet professionalism and supreme technical ability.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1982599", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982599", "title": "Valentina (Philippine comics)", "text": "Valentina (Philippine comics)\n\nValentina is a supervillain created by Mars Ravelo and Nestor Redondo who first appeared in the second episode of the \"Darna\" series published in the Philippine comics \"Pilipino Komiks\" (issue #78, 1950) . One of the most recognizable supervillainess characters in the Philippines, she is the archenemy of Darna. She was originally a bitter, deformed woman born from ordinary human parents with venomous snakes on her head that appears to be like hair. When she grew up, she killed her parents and was subsequently taken in by a serpent creature named Kobra. Valentina was soon referred to as \"goddess of the snakes.\"\n\nMango Comics acquired the rights of Darna and in 2003 released a miniseries featuring Darna and Valentina. In this version, Valentina is an alien from the planet Tiamat. She came from a race that resembles the Nāgas and Gorgons of the Greek mythology. She got an alter-ego named Amor who is a singer. When GMA Network signed a deal with Mango Comics for adopting their comics into the 2005 TV series \"Darna\", most of the story from the Mango Comics were incorporated in the TV series including Valentina's backstory. One of the differences from the comics is that Valentina (played by Alessandra de Rossi) and Darna are cousins.\n\nOutside comics, Valentina is the most sought-after antagonist in other media including film, television, and theater. Several actresses have taken the role since 1951 when the first \"Darna\" film was released, which Cristina Aragon played Valentina. Celia Rodriguez' performance as Valentina in the 1973 film \"Lipad, Darna, Lipad\" was considered as the best depiction of Valentina. In this film, it was the first that she was given a full name, which is Dr. Valentina Vrandakapoor.\n\nValentina is not always presented as a villainess. In the 1989 film \"Valentina\" as well as in the television episodes of \"Komiks\" and \"Wansapanataym\", Valentina is portrayed as a cursed individual but with a good heart and her love interest falls in love with her despite her appearance. In theater plays which were usually presented as ballet musical, Valentina, although still a villain, is depicted in comedic or sympathetic way veering away from her traditional portrayal as a bitter woman.\n\nValentina's debut in Philippine comics is in \"Pilipino Komiks\" #78 (1950), which is the second episode of the comics serial \"Darna\" by Mars Ravelo and Nestor Redondo that ran 28 episodes. She eventually became the archenemy of Darna. In creating Valentina, Ravelo drew inspiration from Medusa, a Gorgon in Greek mythology with living venomous snakes in place of hair. Valentina has venomous snakes on her hair but she does not turn people into stone upon looking in her eyes unlike Medusa.\n\nIn her first appearance, Valentina was born from human parents named Miguel and Doray. Too many restrictions from her parents led Valentina to kill them with the help of her pet snake named Vibora and this is the beginning of her journey to the pathway of evil. Kobra, a creature with a python's body and hag's head, became Valentina's master. Valentina learns to control snakes to do her bidding that made her \"goddess of the snakes.\" After Darna foiled her plan to turn the Earth into a world dominated by reptiles, Valentina commits suicide by jumping into a cliff where the bodies of her parents can be found.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Pablo S. Gomez created a comics novel entitled \"Valentina\" in Universal Komiks that was published by PSG Publication. The main character of the novel, Valentina, is associated with snakes and inspired from Ravelo's Valentina. Due to this comics novel, Valentina became a household name.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Mango Comics acquired the rights of Darna. With inputs from the family of Ravelo, in 2003, Mango Comics released a miniseries featuring Darna with Valentina as the main villainess. In this comics series that was written by Boboy Yonzon and illustrated by Ryan Orosco and Gilbert Monsanto, both Darna and Valentina came from the planet called Tiamat. Darna comes from a warrior race named Adarna that uses artificial wings and the comics clearly link the race's origin from the Adarna bird from early Filipino literature while Valentina comes from a rival race that resembles the Nāgas and Gorgons. In this version, Darna's alter-ego, Narda, is depicted as an ordinary college student. On other hand, Valentina is initially presented as a pop singer named Amor comparing her singing prowess to Britney Spears.\n\nValentina is a serpent queen with a same likeness to the Gorgon Medusa of the Greek mythology, and with this, she has the ability to control all types of snake as well as communicate with them. One of her defining feature is her venomous snakes on her head that she uses to attack enemies and their bite is lethal just like a viper. As a snake goddess, she has an army of snakes that she uses to execute her plan to destroy humankind. She can also change in different forms.\n\nValentina usually has a pet snake and a mentor who teaches him to control snakes. She is normally depicted as a bitter woman who always seeks revenge. In other depictions, she is jealous with Narda's (Darna's alter ego) love interest and attempts to steal the man that Narda (or Darna) loves.\n\nCristina Aragon played the first Valentina role in the film \"Darna\" (1951), the very first film adaptation of \"Darna\" comics series. Twenty-two years later, in 1973, Valentina appeared as a doctoral degree graduate in Reptilian Zooloogy from University of New Delhi in the film \"Lipad, Darna, Lipad!\". Valentina's full name in this film is Dr. Valentina Vrandakapoor, Ph.D. and she wears a turban to hide the snakes on her head. Celia Rodriguez portrayed Valentina in this film and her depiction of the character, particularly the sequence where twelve real snakes cover her body while in bed, made her one of top actress to play Valentina as well as one of the top villain performers in the Philippines. The snakes on the head of Rodriguez were actually eels (Rodriguez referred to it as water snakes).\n\nIn 1989, a film was released by Lea Productions entitled \"Valentina\", where Melissa Perez Rubio played the title role. In this film where Darna did not appear, Valentina is portrayed as a good person who was cursed with snakes on her head and has powers to turn people into stones at will unlike Medusa who makes people into stones through looking at her eyes. Rey \"PJ\" Abellana played Ariel, the love interest of Valentina, which was originally intended for Eric Quizon. \n\nIn the film 1991 film \"Darna\", Pilar Pilapil portrayed Valentina. The film was criticized as campy and Valentina's look was negatively compared to Jacobim Mugatu of \"Zoolander\" while her pet snake Vibora was censured as a downgraded muppet with bright red lips. In another Darna film in the 1990s, \"Darna: Ang Pagbabalik\" (1994), Pilita Corrales played Valentina where she has a daughter named Valentine (portrayed by Cherie Gil) who also has snakes on her head.\n\nAfter ABS-CBN got the film rights for Ravelo's characters in 2013, development of another \"Darna\" film has been in the works since 2014 by ABS-CBN's film production company, Star Cinema, with Angel Locsin reprising her role as Darna, although, full cast was not revealed including the actress who would portray Valentina. Erik Matti was the director of the film whose production company Reality Entertainment was co-producing the film. In 2015, Angel Locsin left the project due to health reasons. Matti continued working on the project without revealing any details about the cast. Liza Soberano was announced to play Darna in 2017 and no other cast information was given. There were rumors circulating that Anne Curtis would portray Valentina in Soberano-led \"Darna\" film but she neither confirm or deny it. Other prospects of actresses who would be Valentina emerged including Venus Raj, Iza Calzado and Jessy Mendiola. In August 2018, Matti said that he already had actors for Ding and Valentina but he did not reveal who were them. In the same month he said this, Soberano had a fractured finger and in April 2019 she announced that she is quitting the project because of the injury.\n\nABS-CBN announced in October 2018 that Matti withdrew as director for the \"Darna\" film because of creative differences. A day after the announcement, it was revealed that Jerrold Tarog replaced Matti as the new director for the \"Darna\" film. With the departure of Soberano, Jane De Leon was unanimously picked as Darna among the 300 actresses who auditioned for the role. On the other hand, the coveted Valentina role has yet to be disclosed and several actresses expressed their desire to fulfill the role, most notably Denise Laurel. In addition to the other actresses who were rumored to be Valentina, it was speculated that the following actresses would be Valentina: Sarah Lahbati, Dimples Romana and Maricar Reyes. \n\nThe very first appearance of Valentina in television is in the 2005 television series \"Darna\" by GMA Network where Alessandra de Rossi played Valentina while Angel Locsin portrayed Darna, which was first offered to Iza Calzado. About more than a decade later, Calzado was also considered to play Valentina in another Darna film. On the other hand, de Rossi had qualms in accepting the Valentina due to her fear of snakes but she was persuaded by the production team to take the role. She initially does not have snakes on her head but eventually had them on her final form. The series pilot which was aired on April 11, 2005 posted a 47.1% rating according to AGB Nielsen and the pilot episode was one of the highest rated in Philippine television. \n\nMost of the plot and story elements of the 2005 \"Darna\" television series were lifted from the 2003 \"Darna\" comics miniseries published by Mango Comics since GMA Network inked a licensing deal with Mango Comics to adapt their comics version into television. In this adaptation, Narda and Valentina are cousins, but in the latter, they found out that they are twins. Efren (played by Dennis Trillo) is both the love interest of Valentina and Narda; Valentina will do anything to get him. Valentina changed to Ava (played by Nadine Samonte) in order for her to get Efren. Valentina was the Anomalkan who will kill the Queen of Anomalka, Braguda, according to the prophecy.\n\nGMA Network rebooted the \"Darna\" series once again in 2009 with Marian Rivera as Darna/Narda and Iwa Moto as Valentina. Moto was initially set to play the villain Babaeng Linta but it was changed and she got the role of Valentina. Katrina Halili was considered to play Valentina but she ended up with another villain, Serpina, the half-sister of Valentina. Although, it turned out that Serpina is actually Valentina. Halili also played a villain in the first \"Darna\" TV series in 2005 as the Black Darna. Moto's Valentina used to be the childhood friend of Narda and Eduardo (love interest of Narda and played by Mark Anthony Fernandez) until she becomes evil and the enemy of Darna.\nValentina's powers in the 2009 \"Darna\" TV series played by Moto are superhuman strength, stamina, reflexes and the usual power in the comics, which is the control of snakes through a psychic bond. In addition, she has the ability to heal herself and can heal people who are sick as well as get rid of poisons or toxins from any person. Although, when her heart is injured, she cannot heal it. Valentina can also telepathically link herself to her half-sister, Serpina. Her superhuman strength can uproot trees and can match Darna's strength. In this series, Kobra (played by Paolo Contis) who is originally a female character in the comics is Valentina's father while her mother is an ordinary human named Consuelo (played by Janice de Belen).\n\nJodi Sta. Maria starred as Valentina in an episode of ABS-CBN's \"Komiks\" television series in 2006 entitled \"Komiks Presents: Valentina.\" The episode is an origin story and Valentina is presented as a good person like in the 1989 film \"Valentina\". Another ABS-CBN television series, \"Wansapanataym\", features Valentina again in one of its episode in 2010. Melissa Ricks got the role to play Valentina in this \"Wansapanataym\" episode and the story is also similar to the \"Komiks\" episode and the \"Valentina\" film where Valentina is presented as a cursed individual but with a good heart.\n\nBefore the \"Darna\" comics characters were adapted into the television medium, they had already appeared first in theater in 1993 where ballerina Lisa Macuja played Darna and Melanie Motus played Valentina in the musical stage play entitled \"Pilipino Komiks\". This ballet stage production was presented by Philippine Ballet Theatre and featured characters made by Mars Ravelo in a comedic way. Almost a quarter a century later in 2017, this play that was first choreographed by Gener Caringal was re-staged again by Philippine Ballet Theatre and co-presented by Filipino Heritage Festival, National Commission for Culture and the Arts, AB Leisure and Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation. In this re-staging of \"Pilipino Komiks\", Regine Magbitang played Darna while Loby Pimentel played Valentina. Both plays were performed in the Cultural Center of the Philippines; the second play additionally performed in Negros, Philippines.\n\nAnother ballet stage play was produced in August 2003 by Ballet Philippines and presented at the Cultural Center of the Philippines. In this theater version, entitled \"Darna\", Christine Crame and Kris-Belle Paclibar alternately danced and played the part of Darna while Valentina who sings was portrayed by Chin-Chin Gutierrez and Tex Ordoñez alternating between the schedule of the stage plays. This production is equally focused on both Darna and Valentina. With choreographic influences from American films such \"The Matrix\" and \"Crouching Tiger,\" \"Hidden Dragon\", the theater play was directed by Chris Millado and choreographed by Denisa Reyes and Alden Lugnasin.\n\nIn May 2018, \"Ding, Ang Bato!\" that was presented by the Arts and Culture Cluster and the Dance Program of the School of Design and Arts of the De La Salle–College of Saint Benilde was a dance musical theatre that once more featured Darna and Valentina. Staged at School of Design and Arts Theater at De La Salle College of St. Benilde and directed also by Chris Millardo, the story is presented at the point-of-view of Ding (played alternately by Carlos Serrano, Juner Quiambao and John Peñaranda), the younger brother of Narda, who is born deaf in this version. Christine Crame reprised her role as Darna while role of Valentina went to Natasha Cabrera. In this version, Valentina is a sympathetic character and has an alter-ego named Tina that was played by Lea Roque.\n\nThe following table lists all the actresses who portrayed Valentina as the main character as well as her alter-ego.

It is one of the six neighbourhoods that make up the urban district of Albayzín and borders the neighbourhoods of Albayzín, San Pedro, Realejo-San Matías, El Fargue and Haza Grande. \n\nIt is located on the hillside and in the valley of Valparaíso, opposite the Alhambra - emblem of Granada. The neighbourhood occupies both banks of the Darro river, whose name seems to be derived from the phrase \"\"d'auro\"\" (\"of gold\") because of its famous gold-bearing sediments.\n\nTraditionally the neighborhood of the Granadian Romani, who settled in Granada after the Christian conquest of the city in 1492, it is one of the most picturesque neighbourhoods of the city, with cave houses installed in whitewashed caves.\n\nThe Romani of Sacromonte have a mixed language known as \"Caló\", which has seen a rapid decline in use over the past century. It is derived from India, where the Romani originated. The Romani of Sacromonte were famously portrayed by the poet Federico García Lorca in his book of poems \"Romancero Gitano\".\n\nThe neighborhood owes its name to an episode which occurred between 1595 and 1599 on the hill of Valparaíso: the supposed discovery of relics and the so-called \"lead books\" or \"Lead Books of Sacromonte\", containing indecipherable drawings and texts in Latin and Arabic characters, which came to be interpreted by some as the fifth gospel. These findings were declared a forgery in the 17th century, but nonetheless led to the construction of the Abbey of Sacromonte, where the supposed relics of Saint Caecilius (co-patron of Granada) and the lead books are now kept.\n\nThe origin of the houses excavated on the slopes of Sacromonte, the traditional dwelling type of the neighborhood, is not very clear. It is assumed that they began to be built from the 16th century, after the Jewish and Muslim populations were expelled from their homes, and intermixed with the nomadic Romani, adopting some of their customs. The caves became housing for the marginalized, located outside the walls of the city, which meant being outside of administrative and ecclesiastical control, particularly the Spanish Inquisition. To dig a cave it was necessary to carve away a part of the face of the hill where they wanted to build, making a vertical cut that served as a facade. The builder then inserted an arch at the midpoint to serve as a door. They then excavated as much space for rooms as the terrain would allow.\n\nThe forms and limits of this unique house type are determined by the terrain, altitude and extent of the hills where the excavation takes place, so there are no two identical caves. These elements, along with the paths, gullies, small squares, whitewashed facades and interiors form a unique landscape, alongside the customs and crafts of their inhabitants, giving the neighbourhood a unique character.\n\nIn addition to the troglodyte houses, another important feature of the neighbourhood is the legends that relate to all corners and places, one of the most well-known being the Ravine of the Blacks.\n\nPopular legends hold that after the loss of Granada to the Catholic Monarchs in the Granada War, the formerly ruling Arabs - who made their way in exile to African lands - never gave up hope of someday returning to the city of their parents and grandparents, where they and their children were born.\n\nAfraid of being preyed upon by bandits or groups of renegade Christian soldiers on the roads to the ports of Almuñécar or Almería, where they embarked for Africa, they hid great treasures among the olive groves which at the time covered Sacromonte.\n\nAt the same time, they granted freedom to the many slaves owned by the noble Arab families, because of the expense and difficulty of performing the journey with a large entourage. Many of these slaves were black, and had noticed the comings and goings of their former owners to Mount Valparaíso (as the area was then called), were aware of their former owners' fears and had overheard many conversations between them regarding burying their possessions. Granted their freedom but without work or belongings, many decided to climb the mountain and recover for themselves the treasures that had once belonged to their former owners.\n\nThey dug and dug into the slopes of the ravine reportedly without success, and exhausted by the effort but left with no alternative shelter, decided to condition the resulting caves and make them their homes. This gave the area the name of \"Ravine of the Blacks\", as these were believed to be the first inhabitants.\n\nIn later years, as Roma began to settle in the area, they supposedly attempted to use many spells in search of the exact places where the treasures were hidden. Many older witches, known as \"ferminibí\", were reported to try talking with water and others with fire, or staring unblinking into basins of water, trying to get some clues to the locations of the lost treasures. To this day it is unknown whether any were discovered and secretly taken away by treasure seekers, or if the treasures remain hidden in the area.\n\nIn addition to the numerous caves, the main monument of the neighbourhood is the Abbey of Sacromonte, built by Archbishop Pedro de Castro y Quiñones in 17th century near the summit of the hill, where the alleged relics and other remains of the first Christians of Granada and evangelizers of Roman Baetica; including Saint Caecilius, martyr and first bishop of the city in the 1st century CE; and other apostolic figures including companions of Saint James, were discovered. The College of Sacromonte was founded by Pedro de Castro as an annex to the abbey.\n\nThe abbey consists of the abbey itself (17th century), the Old College of San Dionisio Areopagita (17th century), the New College (19th century) and the \"Holy Caves\" (\"Santas Cuevas\"). The abbey has an important library with numerous incunabula and manuscripts, but which is currently closed to the public. The \"Santas Cuevas\" are old catacombs which contain several chapels. In one of these, according to tradition, James the Less officiated. This is where the festival of Saint Caecilius takes place.\n\nThe abbey also contains the School of the Holy Mary, founded by teacher and priest Andrés Manjón - known as \"Padre Manjón\" - at the beginning of 20th century to teach Romani children, and whose pedagogical innovations are still in use.\n\nThe abbey is the canonical seat of the Confraternity of the Romani. Mass is celebrated every Sunday at noon.\n\nIn \"Carrera del Darro\" there are numerous monuments, including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Starting from 1712, the planting of the Summer Garden was further elaborated by the Dutch gardener Jan Roosen, who was the chief gardener of the park till 1726. The well-known French architect Jean-Baptiste Le Blond, who arrived in St. Petersburg in 1716, added to the park the flavour of a Garden à la française. The Summer Garden was largely completed in 1719. The walks were lined with a hundred allegorical marble sculptures, executed by Francesco Penso, Pietro Baratta, Marino Gropelli, Alvise Tagliapietra, Bartolomeo Modulo and other Venetian sculptors that were acquired by Sava Vladislavich. In the late 20th century, 90 surviving statues were moved indoors, while modern replicas took their place in the park.\n\nThe sequence of patterned parterres, originally more formal than the current landscape, were the site of Imperial \"assemblies\", or lavish parties which often included balls, feasts, and fireworks. Apart from the statuary, a major park attraction were the fountains, the oldest in Russia, representing scenes from Aesop's fables. Some of these fell out of use and were demolished after the 1777 inundation which destroyed the fountain machinery acquired by Peter the Great in Britain.\n\nA delicate iron-cast railing, separating the park from the public walk of the Palace Embankment, was installed between 1771 and 1784 to a design by Georg von Veldten. The grille is suspended between 36 granite columns crowned with urns and vases. The poet Anna Akhmatova, among others, considered the grille to be a pinnacle of art-casting and one of the symbols of St Petersburg.\n\nIn the 1820s, a grotto pavilion, attributed to Andreas Schlüter and Georg Johann Mattarnovy, was rebuilt into a coffee house. On the bank of the Carp Pond, a magnificent porphyry vase, a gift of Charles XIV of Sweden to the tsar, was installed in 1839. Fifteen years later, to the children's writer Ivan Krylov was opened in the park. A sign of the progress of Romanticism in Russian official culture, it was the first monument to a poet erected in Eastern Europe.\n\nOn 4 April 1866 Dmitry Karakozov made the first attempt to assassinate the tsar when he walked out of the Summer Garden. As the attempt proved abortive, the ponderous in a Russian Revival style was built over the gate. This rather incongruous attachment was demolished by the Bolsheviks after the October Revolution.\n\nThe park was chosen by Alexander Pushkin as a setting for childhood walks of the fictional character Eugene Onegin.\n\nMany of the sculptures now adorning the Summer Garden date back to the early 18th century. In the 19th century, the intended arrangement of the decorative sculptures in the Summer Garden was forgotten, quite a few of the sculptures were no longer extant, and those remaining were moved from place to place, thus destroying the original design. In late 20th century, all sculptures were rearranged and today they stand in accordance with the aesthetic ideas characteristic of the beginning of the 18th century.\n\nThe Summer Garden Park is widely considered by many one of the most romantic, evocative and beautiful places in St Petersburg.\n\n\n"}

Created in 2000, the order is administered by the Governor General-in-Council, on behalf of the Canadian monarch. Appointment to the order recognizes conspicuous merit and exceptional service, the level of which is reflected by the organization's three hierarchical grades.\n\nThe Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police in 1996 approached the Chancellery of Honours at Rideau Hall to propose an order of merit for Canada's police forces, possibly modelled on the Order of Military Merit. This prompted the Solicitor General of Canada at the time, Herb Gray, to contact his provincial counterparts, inquiring of their reactions to the idea. As consent from the provincial governments was unanimous in its approval, the society was set up and officially implemented when, on 3 October 2000, Queen Elizabeth II applied the royal sign-manual to her letters patent constituting the Order of Merit of the Police Forces. The first induction ceremony for the order then took place on 17 May 2002.\n\nThe Canadian monarch, seen as the fount of honour, is at the apex of the Order of Merit of the Police Forces as its Sovereign, followed by the governor general, who serves as the fellowship's Chancellor, and the Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, who is the Principal Commander. Thereafter follow three grades—each having accordant post-nominal letters that are the same in both English and French. Promotions in grade are possible, though there are limits to the populations of the grades. Any person thus honoured must return their lower grade insignia, as no member may at any time hold more than one appointment in the organization. Further, within the order of preference for Canadian honours, each grade of the Order of Merit of the Police Forces precedes a similar grade of the Royal Victorian Order and succeeds a similar grade of the Order of Military Merit.\n\nUpon admission into the Order of Merit of the Police Forces, members are gifted various insignia of the organization, though these remain property of the Crown. The badges are similar in design to those of the Order of Military Merit, consisting of a dark blue enamelled cross \"pattée\" with four equal arms, at the centre of which is a disc bearing a maple leaf on a white enamel background, surrounded at its edge by a red enamel ring (annulus) bearing the words \"MERIT • MÉRITE • CANADA\". Slight differences in appearance represent each grade: for Commanders, the emblem is gilt with a red enamel maple leaf in the gold central disk; for Officers, it is gilt with a gold maple leaf; and for Members, both the badge itself and the maple leaf are silver. The reverse bears only a serial number, and all are topped by a St. Edward's Crown, symbolizing that the order is headed by the sovereign. These insignia are worn with the order's ribbon, which is three bands of equal width, the outer two in blue and the centre one in golden. Male Commanders will carry their badge either at the neck or on a medal bar on the left chest, while Officers and Members display theirs only on a medal bar, suspended by, respectively, a bar of gold or silver decorated with a laurel motif. Women wear their emblems on a ribbon bow pinned at the left chest. The ribbon bar, worn for undress, is the same for each grade, save for a miniature blue cross \"pattée\" with a maple leaf, the colour of which matches that on the badge of the grade that the wearer was appointed to; someone who has been promoted within the order may wear on their ribbon bar the pins of all grades that they have occupied. These same miniatures also serves as a lapel pin for civilian wear.\n\nTo qualify for induction into the Order of Merit of the Police Forces, individuals must be, at the time of appointment, an active member of any of Canada's police services, including criminal investigators, patrol officers, administrators, trainers, and researchers. Either civilians or the advisory committee of the local branch of the Association of Chiefs of Police will forward names to the national advisory committee, which then makes its recommendation to the Advisory Committee for the Order of Merit of the Police Forces. This latter group consists of the President of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, who acts as chairperson, one of the Deputy Commissioners of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the President of the Canadian Police Association, one head of a provincial police force, three chiefs of municipal or regional police forces, the Deputy Secretary of the Chancellery of Honours, and two additional persons appointed by the governor general for between three and five years; the Secretary to the Governor General serves as the Secretary General of the Order of Merit of the Police Forces.\n\nApproximately 50 individuals are admitted to the order each year; the total is limited to 0.1% of the total number of employees of police services in Canada in the preceding year. No more than six percent of those appointed to the order in total may be inducted as Commanders and no more than 30% may be made Officers. Inductions are also not made posthumously, though members of foreign armed forces can be admitted as honorary members in any grade.\n\nThe constitution of the order allows for the removal of members. Only one termination has yet taken place: Royal Canadian Mounted Police sergeant Warren S. Gherasim, appointed to the order in 2006, was removed from the rolls in 2010 for receiving a disgraceful conduct sanction.\n"}

{"id": "1982652", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982652", "title": "Typographical conventions in mathematical formulae", "text": "Typographical conventions in mathematical formulae\n\nTypographical conventions in mathematical formulae provide uniformity across mathematical texts and help the readers of those texts to grasp new concepts quickly.\n\nMathematical notation includes letters from various alphabets, as well as special mathematical symbols. Letters in various fonts often have specific, fixed meanings in particular areas of mathematics. A mathematical article or a theorem typically starts from the definitions of the introduced symbols, such as: \"Let \"G\" = (\"V\", \"E\") be a graph with the vertex set \"V\" and edge set \"E\"...\". Theoretically it is admissible to write \"Let \"X\" = (\"a\", \"q\") be a graph with the vertex set \"a\" and edge set \"q\"...\"; however, this would decrease readability, since the reader has to consciously memorize these unusual notations in a limited context.\n\nUsage of subscripts and superscripts is also an important convention. In the early days of computers with limited graphical capabilities for text, subscripts and superscripts were represented with the help of additional notation. In particular, \"n\" could be written as n^2 or n**2 (the latter borrowed from FORTRAN) and \"n\" could be written as n_2.\n\nVarious international authorities, including IUPAC, NIST and ISO have produced similar recommendations with regard to typesetting variables and other mathematical symbols (whether in equations or otherwise).\n\nIn general, anything that represents a variable (for example, \"h\" for a patient's height) should be set in italic type, and everything else should be set in roman type. This applies equally to characters from the Latin/English alphabet (a, b, ..., z, A, B, ..., Z) as to letters from any other alphabet, most notably Greek (α, β, γ, ..., ω, Α, Β, Γ, ..., Ω). Any operator, such as cos (representing the cosine function) or ∑ (representing summation), should therefore be set roman. Note that each element must be set depending upon its own merits, including subscripts and superscripts. Thus, \"h\" would be suitable for the interior height of a dome (the subscript \"i\" being an abbreviation of the word \"interior\"), while \"h\" would represent one instance (the \"i\"-th) from a set {\"h\", \"h\", \"h\", ...} of heights. Notice that numbers (1, 2, 3, \"etc.\") are not variables, and so are always set roman. Likewise, in some special cases symbols are used to represent general constants, such as π used to represent the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, and such general constants can be set in roman. (This does not apply to parameters which are merely chosen to not vary.) \nFor vectors, matrices and tensors, it is recommended to set the variable itself in boldface (excluding any associated subscripts or superscripts). Hence, u would be suitable for the initial velocity, while u\" would represent one instance from a set of velocities (u, u, u\", ...). Italic is still used for variables, both for lowercase and for uppercase symbols (Latin, Greek, or otherwise). The only general situation where italic is not used for bolded symbols is for vector operators, such as ∇ (nabla), set bold and roman.\n\nThe rules of mathematical typography differ from country to country; thus, American mathematical journals and books will tend to use slightly different conventions from those of European journals.\n\nOne advantage of mathematical notation is its modularity—it is possible to write extremely complicated formulae involving multiple levels of super- or subscripting, and multiple levels of fraction bars. However, it is considered poor style to set up a formula in such a way as to leave more than a certain number of levels; for example, in non-math publications\nmight be rewritten as\n\nIncidentally, the above formula demonstrates the American rule that italic type is used for all letters representing variables and parameters except uppercase Greek letters, which are in upright type. Upright type is also standard for digits and punctuation; currently, the ISO-mandated style of using upright for constants (such as e, i) is not widespread. Bold Latin capital letters usually represent matrices, and bold lowercase letters are often used for vectors. The names of well-known functions, such as sin \"x\" (the trigonometric function sine) and exp \"x\" (the constant \"e\" raised to the power of \"x\") are written in lowercase upright letters (and often, as shown here, without parentheses around the argument).\n\nCertain important constructs are sometimes referred to by blackboard bold letters. For example, some authors denote the set of natural numbers by formula_3. Other authors prefer to use bold Latin for these symbols. (In context of math, font variations such as bold/non-bold may encode an arbitrary relation between symbols; using specialized symbols for formula_3 etc. allows the author more freedom of expressing such relations.)\n\nDonald Knuth's TeX typesetting engine incorporates a large amount of additional knowledge about American-style mathematical typography.\n\n"}

The role and powers of the Governor are set out in of the Falkland Islands Constitution. The Governor in office resides at Government House, which serves as the official residence.\n\nThe history of the leadership on the islands is closely related to the history of the Falkland Islands themselves. The first settlement on the islands was at Port St. Louis and was led by Louis Antoine de Bougainville, the Administrator of the French settlement which started in 1764 and ended three years later. The first leader of a British settlement was John McBride, Captain of HMS \"Jason\", in 1766 at Port Egmont (the settlement being established a year earlier). The French settlement of Port St. Louis was transferred to the Spanish in 1767 and renamed Puerto Soledad, the first Spanish Military Administrator being Felipe Ruíz Puente. The British chose to withdraw from many overseas settlements in 1776 due to the pressure of the American War of Independence. The Spanish settlement ended in 1811 as a result of the Peninsular war.\n\nIn 1829 Luis Vernet was proclaimed Military and Civil Commander of Puerto Luis (the Falklands) by the United Provinces of South America, which elicited a protest from the British Government. In 1831, Vernet seized three US vessels and imprisoned their crews for contravening his regulations on sealing, prompting a raid by the USS \"Lexington\". In response, the United Kingdom sent a task force to reassert British sovereignty over the Falkland Islands in 1833. The Falklands were then settled, mainly by people from Wales and Scotland.\n\nThe first Governor of the Falklands was Richard Clement Moody, who was governor from 1841 to 1848 (the post was renamed 'governor' from 'lieutenant-governor' in 1843). Moody selected the site for and founded Stanley and Moody Brook is named after him. There was then a British government on the islands until 1982 when the Falklands were invaded and occupied by Argentina for 74 days. During this time, the British Governor (Sir Rex Hunt) was expelled and General of Brigade Mario Menéndez was appointed 'Military Governor of the Malvinas, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands' () by the Argentine military junta.\n\nFollowing the Argentine surrender at the end of the Falklands War, the British Governor returned and it was decided that the Government of the Falkland Islands should be modernised. In 1985 the Constitution of the Falklands came into force which greatly reduced the power of the Governor, making the office more accountable to the Executive Council of the Falkland Islands and creating in law a new post of Chief Executive, to which many powers of the Governor were delegated. In 2009 a new constitution was established which further defined the role and powers of the Governor.\n\nThe Governor is appointed by the Queen on the advice of her Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs in the United Kingdom. The appointment is actually made by a Royal Commission under the royal sign-manual.\n\nUnder the Constitution, executive authority of the Falkland Islands is vested in the Queen, and her authority is exercised on her behalf by the Governor. The Governor normally only executes executive power on the advice of the Executive Council of the Falkland Islands, which consists of three elected members of the Legislative Assembly, the Chief Executive and the Director of Finance. In addition, the Attorney General and the Commander of the British Forces in the South Atlantic attend council meetings by invitation, although they cannot vote in the Council meetings. The Governor also acts as the Presiding Officer of the Executive Council.\n\nActing on the advice of the Executive Council, the Governor has the power to call a meeting of the Executive Council, dissolve the Legislative Assembly and call a general election by proclamation, recall a dissolve Assembly, give Royal Assent to laws passed by the Legislative Assembly, and disallow or reintroduce a law passed by the Legislative Assembly. The Governor also appoints the members and can remove members of the Advisory Committee on the Prerogative of Mercy after consulting Legislative Assembly. On the advice of the Advisory Committee, the Governor may grant pardons to anyone convicted of any offence, as well as commute or remit any sentence of any person convicted on the islands.\n\nIn most cases, the Governor must consult with the Executive Council, and accept its advice. There are exceptions, however, set out in the constitution, when the Governor is permitted to not consult the Council and even go against its advice, but in this eventuality, the Governor is required to inform the Secretary of State in the UK of the reasons for this action, and in the case of blocking laws passed by the Legislative Assembly, the Secretary of State must give prior authorisation. Under section 67 of the constitution, the Governor may go against the advice of the Council if in his or her judgement, it would be right to do so in the interests of good governance or if such advice would affect external affairs, defence, internal security (including the police), administration of justice, audit, appointments to the public service, the discipline and removal from office of public officers, and the management of the public service. In all these instances the members of the Executive Council can appeal to the Secretary of State.\n\nThe Governor is also responsible for the defence and internal security of the Falklands (with the exception of police matters), though the Governor is constitutionally obliged to consult with the Commander of the British Forces on such matters.\n\nIf the office of Governor ever becomes vacant or if the incumbent Governor is absent from the Falklands or unable to perform his or her duties, the Queen, on the advice of her Secretary of State, can appoint an Acting Governor under section 24 of the constitution. The Acting Governor must take the oath before assuming office and has all the powers and duties of the Governor until a new Governor is appointed or the incumbent Governor is able to carry on with his or her duties.\n\nUnder section 23(3) of the constitution, before entering upon the functions of his or her office, the Governor must take the oath of allegiance and the oath of office. The wording for the oath of office is specified in Annex B to the Constitution:\n"}
{"id": "1982686", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982686", "title": "Feline panleukopenia", "text": "Feline panleukopenia\n\nFeline panleukopenia virus (FPLV) is a species of parvovirus that can infect all wild and domestic members of the felid (cat) family worldwide. It is a highly contagious, severe infection that causes gastrointestinal, immune system, and nervous system disease. (\"Panleukopenia\" means a decrease in the number of white blood cells.)\n\nIt has been thought to be single variant of \"Carnivore protoparvovirus\" (CPV 1); however, it has been confirmed that a feline panleukopenia illness can be caused by CPV 2a, 2b, and 2c.\n\nFPLV is commonly referred to as: \n\n\nIt is sometimes confusingly referred to as \"cat plague\" and \"feline distemper\".\n\nIn addition to members of the felid family, it can also affect some members of related families (e.g. raccoon, mink).\n\nThe feline panleukopenia virus is considered ubiquitous, meaning it is in virtually every place that is not regularly disinfected. The infection is highly contagious among unvaccinated cats.\n\nActive immune response against FPLV antibodies play an important role in the immune response to the virus. Maternally-derived antibodies (MDA) efficiently protect kittens from fatal infection. This passively acquired immunity is later replaced by an active immune response obtained by vaccination or as a consequence of a natural infection. In kittens, the period of greatest susceptibility to infection is when maternal antibodies are absent or waning and vaccine-induced immunity has not yet fully developed.\n\nFree-roaming cats are thought to be exposed to the virus during their first year of life. Those that develop subclinical infection or survive acute illness mount a robust, long-lasting, protective immune response.\n\nAn infected cat sheds large amounts of virus in all body secretions including feces, vomit, urine, saliva, and mucus during the acute phase of illness. It can continue to shed the virus for as long as 6 weeks after recovery. Subclinically ill cats can also shed the virus in body secretions. The virus can be carried or transferred on an infected object (such as bedding, food dishes, fur) or by other animals, fleas, and humans (see: fomites). It persists long after evidence of the original body secretion has faded away, and can be transported long distances. Like all parvoviruses, FPLV is extremely resistant to inactivation and can survive for longer than one year in a suitable environment. Kitten deaths have been reported in households of fully vaccinated cats, possibly because of exposure to large amounts of virus in the environment.\n\nInfection occurs when the virus enters the body through the mouth or nose. Whether illness results or not depends on the immunity in the victim vs. the number of individual virus particles (i.e. the amount of virus) entering the body.\n\nThe clinical manifestations of FPLV are variable based on the dose of the virus, the age of the cat, potential breed predispositions, and prior immunity from maternal antibodies, previous exposure, or vaccination. Most infections are subclinical, as evidenced by the high seroprevalence of anti-FPV antibodies among some populations of unvaccinated, healthy cats. The cats that become clinically ill are usually <1 yr old, but older cats are also at risk. There is high mortality in clinically affected kittens and sudden death can occur.\n\nClinical signs usually develop in 4–6 days after exposure, but can show in 2–14 days. The virus infects and destroys actively dividing cells in bone marrow, lymphoid tissues, intestinal epithelium, and—in very young animals—in the cerebellum and retina. The virus primarily attacks the lining of the gastrointestinal tract, causing internal ulceration and, ultimately, total sloughing of the intestinal epithelium. \n\nPrimary signs include: \n\n\nClinical laboratory findings include (but are not limited to):\n\n\nOther signs include: fever, loss of skin elasticity due to dehydration, abdominal pain, sternal recumbency with splayed legs and head droop, nasal discharge and conjunctivitis. Cats may sit at a water bowl, but not drink. Terminal cases are hypothermic and may develop septic shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation.\n\nInfection in pregnant cats can result in fetal resorption, mummification, abortion, or stillbirth of neonates. Fetuses infected in utero that survive and kittens less than a few weeks of age that become infected can have cerebellar hypoplasia, retinal dysplasia, and optic neuropathy. \n\nA presumptive clinical diagnosis of FPLV can be made for kittens with appropriate signalment, history, clinical findings and the history of no prior vaccination.\n\nThe clinical diagnosis is usually supported by documenting parvovirus antigen in feces by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and PCR (polymerase chain reaction) assays. The availability of validated assays vary by country, but are becoming more common. PCR assays are so sensitive that FPV DNA can be amplified from feces of cats vaccinated with modified live strains of the virus. At least one of the ELISA antigen tests for dogs (SNAP®Parvo; IDEXX Laboratories) detects FPV in feline feces and has a cut point for a positive test result that excludes most vaccinated cats. Thus, this ELISA is superior to PCR for screening cats for FPV infection and can also be performed in the veterinary clinic. (These are only approved and licensed for detecting canine parvovirus, but it is generally known that they also detect FPL viral antigen in feline feces. These tests are used extra label because they allow rapid, inexpensive, in-house detection of the virus.) Some cats will have completed the shedding period by the time the test is run, leading to false negative results. Electron microscopy, virus isolation and seroconversion can also be used to document active or recent infection.\n\nLeukopenia on a complete blood count (nadir 50–3,000 WBC/μL) supports a diagnosis of FPLV. In an unvaccinated cat, the presence of antibodies against FPV indicate that the cat either has the disease or has had the disease in the past. Elevated IgM titers (1:10 or greater) indicate active infection and if clinical signs are obvious (diarrhea, panleukopenia) the prognosis is poor. Elevated IgG titers (1:100 or greater) in a cat with clinical signs indicates a better prognosis. \n\nDifferential diagnoses include salmonellosis, enteric toxins, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline leukemia virus (FeLV), cryptosporidiosis, pancreatitis, septicaemia with acute endotoxemia, toxoplasmosis, peritonitis, and lymphoma.\n\nTo contain the virus, cats with suspected or diagnosed FPLV should be kept in isolation.\n\nIt requires immediate, aggressive treatment if the cat is to survive, as it can be fatal in less than 24 hours. Several articles and publications provide guidance for rescuers and veterinarians for optimizing outcomes. \n\nTreatment involves: \n\n\nFeeding should be continued as long as possible. A highly digestible diet is preferred, but the individual animal's preferences may dictate giving whatever it will eat. In anorexic, hypoproteinemic, vomiting and diarrheic cats parenteral nutrition is required.\n\nIn a disease outbreak, unvaccinated kittens or adults can be given anti-FPV serum containing FPV antibodies injected subcutaneously or intraperitoneal. This may provide protection for 2–4 weeks. Therapeutic efficacy of anti-FPV serum has been demonstrated in dogs, and similar beneficial effects may be expected in cats.\n\nSeveral studies have shown feline recombinant interferon-omega is effective in the treatment of parvoviral enteritis in dogs and also inhibits replication of FPV in cell culture. So far no data are available on its efficacy in FPV-infected cats.\n\nCats typically die due to complications associated with sepsis, dehydration, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). Leukocytopenia predisposes patients to secondary infections, especially bacterial and fungal, though secondary viral infections also occur.\n\nIt has been stated that cats with FPLV may be at risk for endocarditis or cardiomyopathy (since CPV-2 is a well-known cause of viral myocarditis in young puppies), but a 2017 retrospective study concluded that \"Feline Panleukopenia Virus Is Not Associated With Myocarditis or Endomyocardial Restrictive Cardiomyopathy in Cats\".\n\nMortality in affected felid litters varies between 20 and 100%. Mortality of FPLV is 25–90% in domestic cats with the acute form of the disease and up to 100% in cats with peracute disease.\n\nIn 2010, a retrospective study of 244 infected cats showed that \"leukocyte and thrombocyte counts as well as serum albumin and potassium concentrations at presentation are prognostic indicators in cats with panleukopenia, whereas vaccination status, age, clinical signs, and housing conditions are not.\" \n\nA survival rate of about 50% has been reported with supportive therapies. Cats with FPLV that survive the first 5 days of treatment usually recover, however the decrease in the cat's white blood cells compromises its immune system, leaving it vulnerable to secondary infection.\n\nLifelong immunity is thought to follow recovery from disease, and a carrier state of the disease has never been identified.\n\nCats with suspected or diagnosed FPLV should be kept in isolation. This non-enveloped virus is very resistant to environmental conditions and many disinfectants, is highly contagious, and rapidly accumulates in the environment due to high shedding of virus from affected animals. Strict protocols for containment – with isolation, minimal handling, and disinfection of all potential sources of fomites – is warranted. Recovered cats can still shed the virus for up to 6 weeks and can carry it on their body for prolonged periods. \n\nThe practice of recommending and giving vaccines on a fixed schedule with annual boosters has been widely discarded. Current recommendations are based on the philosophy of vaccinating each cat no more frequently than necessary. These recommendations take into account considerations for the efficacy and longevity of each specific vaccine; the exposure, risk, and need of different cat populations; and socioeconomic limitations. \n\nRecommendations vary for:\n\n\nThe FPLV vaccination is considered a \"core\" (essential for health) vaccine and is recommended for all domestic cats. Even cats kept indoors can be infected from fomite transmission.\n\nSeveral types and brands of commercial FPLV vaccines are available to induce acquired immunity. These include: \n\n\nCombination vaccines that provide protection against several common viruses, including FPLV, are also available. \n\nSelection or use of a specific type/brand of vaccine may vary depending on the overall risk of viral infection to the specific animal in its environment, along with considerations for the time it takes to confer protection, its overall efficacy, the animal's health, and the potential risks associated with MLV vs killed, adjuvanted vs non adjuvanted, intranasal/ocular vs injection. \n\nModified-live FPLV vaccines are not recommended in pregnant queens, very young kittens, or cats with FIV or FeLV.\n\nKittens without maternally derived antibodies are especially vulnerable. FPLV vaccination can start as early as 4 weeks of age for kitten at high risk, but are usually started at 6 weeks, then given every 3 – 4 weeks until 16 weeks of age. For cats older than 16 weeks, 2 doses, 3 to 4 weeks apart is generally recommended, followed by a 6-month to 1-year booster. Thereafter, a booster vaccination every 3 years is usually recommended; a blood titer test can be done to determine individual antibody levels for catering the timing of boosters.\n\n"}
{"id": "1982688", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982688", "title": "Space Precinct", "text": "Space Precinct\n\nSpace Precinct is a British television series that was first broadcast from 1994 to 1995 on Sky One and later on BBC Two from 1995 to 1996 in the UK, and in first-run syndication in the United States. Many US stations scheduled the show in late night time slots, which resulted in low ratings and contributed to its cancellation.\n\nThe series was created by Gerry Anderson and was a mix of science fiction and police procedural that combined elements of many of Anderson's previous series such as \"\", \"UFO\" and \"Thunderbirds\", but with an added dash of \"Law & Order\" and \"Dragnet\". Anderson was executive producer with Tom Gutteridge. One of the series' directors was John Glen, who had previously directed five \"James Bond\" films.\nThere were a number of directors used on the series, but the majority of the episodes were edited by the series editors, Sue Robinson and Jason Krasucki.\n\nThe series is set in the year 2040 and starred American actor Ted Shackelford as former NYPD detective Patrick Brogan, now a lieutenant with the Demeter City police force on the planet Altor in the Epsilon Eridani system. Brogan and his partner Jack Haldane (played by Rob Youngblood) must adjust to living in another solar system, and investigating crimes being committed by aliens as well as humans. Also co-starring was Danish actress Simone Bendix as Officer Jane Castle, Haldane's love interest (Brogan was happily married with a wife, daughter and son who made the move to Demeter City with him). All other major characters were played by actors wearing complex make-up that also included elements of puppetry in order to depict the different alien races.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe series was one of the highest-budgeted shows Anderson produced, and was relatively popular in Europe. However, in a repeat of the situation that \"UFO\" encountered 25 years earlier, American broadcasters were uncertain what to make of the series that looked on the surface to be aimed at younger viewers, yet featured adult-oriented storylines and was usually played straight despite the bizarre storylines and make-up. As a result, \"Space Precinct\" was often scheduled in late-night/early morning time slots. The subsequent low ratings led to its cancellation after just one season.\n\nThe idea for \"Space Precinct\" predated the series by nearly a decade. In 1987 Anderson produced Space Police, a 55-minute pilot film that featured Anderson regular Shane Rimmer as Brogan. The series failed to sell at that time and the pilot was never broadcast.\n\nThe pilot, which has since circulated on video and online, features many differences. Brogan is a much older character than that played by Shackleford, and is a bachelor. His partner - and the only other apparently human character in the pilot - is Sgt. Cathy Costello, who is revealed to be a Gynoid capable of shifting between human appearance and a more robotic look for dangerous missions. The aliens featured in the pilot are catlike rather than the more exotic aliens in \"Space Precinct\". The only character other than Brogan to transfer from the pilot to the series is the robot Slo-Mo. The pilot, which is more comedic in nature than the somewhat serious series that followed, combined live action, full-size prosthetics, puppetry, and Supermacromation techniques.\n\n\"Space Precinct\" was released on DVD in the UK but, as of 2015, is out of print. It was released on DVD in North America on 23 November 2010. As of July 2017 \"Space Precinct\" is available in the US on streaming service Amazon Prime. In November 2018, the complete series was rereleased as a DVD box set in Region 2, by Network DVD.\n\n"}

{"id": "1982691", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982691", "title": "Western Lombard dialect", "text": "Western Lombard dialect\n\nWestern Lombard is a group of dialects of Lombard, a Romance language spoken in Italy. It is widespread in the Lombard provinces of Milan, Monza, Varese, Como, Lecco, Sondrio, a small part of Cremona (except Crema and its neighbours), Lodi and Pavia, and the Piedmont provinces of Novara, Verbano-Cusio-Ossola, the eastern part of the Province of Alessandria (Tortona), a small part of Vercelli (Valsesia), and Switzerland (the Canton of Ticino and part of the Canton of Graubünden). After the name of the region involved, land of the former Duchy of Milan, this language is often referred to as Insubric (see Insubria and Insubres) or Milanese, or, after Clemente Merlo, Cisabduano (literally \"of this side of Adda River\").\n\nIn Italian-speaking contexts, Western Lombard is often incorrectly called a dialect of Italian. Western Lombard and Standard Italian are very different. Some speakers of Lombard varieties may have difficulty understanding each other and require a standard to communicate, but all Western Lombard varieties are mutually intelligible. Western Lombard is relatively homogeneous (much more so than Eastern Lombard language), though it does present a number of variations, mainly in relation to the vowels , and the development of into .\n\nAt the present time, Western Lombard has no official status in Lombardy or anywhere else. The only official language in Lombardy is Italian.\n\nThe general lines of diachronics of Western Lombard plural declension are drawn here, with reference to Milanese orthography:\n\nThe bulk of feminine words ends with the inflection \"-a\"; the feminine plural is non-inflected (\"la legora\" / \"i legor\" ; \"la cadrega\" / \"i cadregh\"). The final vowel finds its original length (in non-final syllable you can't hear the difference) that's often long when followed by a voiced consonant, short when followed by a voiceless consonant. When the stem ends with a particular group of consonants there can be the addition of a final \"-i\" or of a schwa between consonants (for example: in Milanese sing. \"scendra\", plur. \"scendr\" > \"scender\"). For adjectives, the plural form and masculine form are often the same.\n\nThe bulk of masculine nouns end without inflections and plural masculine is always non-inflected (\"el tramvaj\"/\"i tramvaj\" ; \"el lett\"/\"i lett\" ). When the word stem terminates with a particular group of consonants there can be, in both singular and plural forms, the addition of a schwa between consonants. When the addition of schwa appears unnatural, a final \"-o\" (pron. /u/) is added to singular nouns, \"-i\" for plurals.\n\nThe masculine words ending in \"-in\", or, less commonly, in \"-ett\", have plural \"itt\" (\"fiolin\"/\"fiolitt\"). The masculine words ending in \"-ll\" have plural \"-j\" derived from dropping of \"-ll-\" and the addition of \"-i\" (\"el sidell\"/\"i sidej\" ; \"el porscell\"/\"i porscej\" ; \"el cavall\" / \"i cavaj\"). The same occurs in the determinate article: singular \"ell\" > \"el\", plural \"elli\" > \"ej\" > \"i\".\n\nMasculine words ending in \"-a\" are unvarying. These are proper names, words from ancient Greek or idiomatic words such as \"pirla\", a derogatory term for a person.\n\nWestern Lombard can be divided into four main varieties: \"lombardo alpino\" (spoken in the provinces of Sondrio and of Verbania, Sopraceneri of Canton Ticino and Grigioni in Switzerland), \"lombardo-prealpino occidentale\" (spoken in the provinces of Como, Varese and Lecco, Lugano and its neighbors in Canton Ticino), \"basso-lombardo occidentale\" (Pavia and Lodi), and \"macromilanese\" (provinces of Milan, Monza, Novara and Valsesia of Vercelli). The boundaries are obviously schematic, since the political division in provinces and municipalities are usually independent from languages spoken.\n\nExamples of Western Lombard language are:\n\n\nThe phonology is based on the Milanese dialect: \n\n only occurs as a nasal sound preceding velar stops.\n\nA double vowel \"aa\" is pronounced as . may also be pronounced as a back unrounded .\n\nThe most important orthography in Western Lombard literature is the Classical Milanese orthography.\nIt was used by Carlo Porta (1775–1821) and Delio Tessa (1886–1939). It was perfected by the Circolo Filologico di Milano. Other orthographies are the Ticinese, the Comasca, the Bosina, the Nuaresat, and the Lecchese.\n\nSome texts in Western Lombard are available: various dictionaries, a few grammars, extensive literature (see Insubric literature), and a recent translation of the Gospels.\n\n\n"}

It is based on \"The Evil Dead\" series. It is unconnected to the previous video game \"\". The game takes place in an alternate reality from the original trilogy, depicting what would have happened if Ash did not get sent back in time at the end of the film \"Evil Dead II\".\n\nAsh Williams (voiced by Bruce Campbell) is locked away in an asylum for the criminally insane, as a result of the events that took place in \"The Evil Dead\" and \"Evil Dead II\". Convinced the world thinks he is crazy, the truth is much more nefarious. His doctor, Dr. Reinhard, somehow in possession of Professor Raymond Knowby's diary and the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis, plans on using the books to bring about his ascension to power. In the process he releases an army of Deadites on the unsuspecting world and it is Ash's job to stop the doctor and put the Deadites back where they belong.\n\nThe game begins in Sunny Meadows, the asylum Ash is committed to. Ash is briefly visited by his lawyer, Sally who mentions how she found Professor Knowby's diary and believes Ash's story about the Necronomicon and the cabin. Ash thanks Sally for her efforts and awkwardly flirts with her. Just after Sally leaves, Reinhard accidentally unleashes the dead through the Necronomicon. The evil also breaks Ash free in the process. Ash travels through the asylum killing deadites with a pistol he retrieved from a dead security guard. He eventually finds his clothing, his boomstick and his chainsaw in the process. As he goes through the asylum, Ash finds an electric deadite named Sparky. Ash kills Sparky and decapitates him. Ash briefly breaks the fourth wall, telling us that \"Ash is back in business\", and throws Sparky's head away. Ash proceeds through the nearby cellar. However, just as he is about to leave the asylum, Professor Knowby's spirit appears to Ash, telling him that Reinhard's plan requires the closing of several portals and how Sally is in danger for having the diary. Ash teams up with a diminutive victim of Reinhard, a half-dead man named Sam (voiced by Ted Raimi) who can return from any death (as he is half-Deadite, but isn't affected by the evil). His condition grants him many mystical skills.\n\nAsh and Sam travel through to a cemetery and eventually find a portal in the nearby catacombs. However, guarding the portal is a large deadite queen. Ash kills the queen with Sam's help and Sam closes the portal. The evil spirit inside the queen goes into Ash, briefly making him a deadite. However, for some reason, Ash can now control when he can turn into \"Evil Ash\".\n\nAsh and Sam go through the woods surrounding Sunny Meadows to find it infested with deadites as well. Ash finds a harpoon gun in a trash pile and modifies it onto his right hand. Ash and Sam, with the help of his harpoon gun, make their way into an abandoned mine where they find another portal. However, as soon as they get there a spirit possesses a miner. Ash and Sam kill the deadite miner and close the portal. Professor Knowby tells them that Reinhard has his diary finally and needs a human sacrifice. Ash believes that Sally is the one he intends to sacrifice. Ash and Sam follow a mine shaft towards nearby docks where another portal is believed to be located. Ash goes to another trash pile there and finds a high powered torpedo gun. The duo destroy a fish creature guarding the docks portal.\n\nAsh and Sam make their way through a swamp, where they find a shack full of flammable materials and create a flamethrower. Ash and Sam make their way through the swamp to a nearby town called Port Turnham which is infested with Deadites. They make their way through the destroyed city and in the process Ash replaces his chainsaw with a newer one with a titanium blade. Ash and Sam find a portal in a nearby courthouse. However, Sam succumbs to fatigue and yawns while he is saying the incantation. The portal, instead of closing, sucks both of them into it. Once they are inside the portal Ash and Sam find themselves in a hellish dimension. Professor Knowby shows up telling them the only way out is to defeat Reinhard and rescue Sally. However, he begins talking about how Ash must save the world in which Ash becomes very angry and says he is only out to save Sally and maybe Sam.\n\nAsh and Sam face many obstacles in the Deadite temple, but after much struggle they make their way to Reinhard's lair where he is just about to sacrifice Sally. Reinhard says how impressed he is with Ash. However, he apologizes that they had to come a long way to die. Rienhard uses the Necronomicon to turn himself into a troll-like Deadite. Ash and Sam kill Reinhard and Sam closes the portal. In a very romantic scene Ash says he came a long way and overcame great odds to apologize to Sally on the fashion advice he gave her back at Sunny Meadows. Just as he is leaning to kiss Sally, a spirit possesses her. Ash, overcome with rage, shoots the possessed Sally. However, just as he does this the portal reopens and sucks Ash and Sam into it along with the Necronomicon possibly sending them back in time, presumably to its own alternate version of Army of Darkness, thus ending the game.\n\nThe gameplay mostly consists of hack and slash with small conveniently placed puzzles. The player takes the role of Ash Williams as he fights off hordes of Deadites. The player can find different kinds of weapons in levels which find use in different situations. Early on in the game Ash receives his sidekick Sam who fights along with him in battle. Unlike other games where killing a friend ingame is taboo at best, Sam actually comically dies many times in the game. The player can kick Sam into openings to open doors or onto enemies to pop their heads off. The player can also possess Sam to get through small openings; the purpose is to open a door or a switch. At times, Sam is controlled by the computer and destroys adversaries without assistance. Sometimes enemies will need a 'finishing move' (pressing a specific button) in order to completely destroy them.\n\nIn contrast with previous games, the game automatically gives the player unlimited ammunition for his weapons and unlimited gas to his chainsaw. A new gameplay element is rage mode. When the player kills enough enemies it fills up his rage meter. When the rage meter is filled up to a decent amount it allows Ash to go into \"rage mode\". Rage mode transforms Ash into a powerful deadite killing machine. It instantly doubles all of Ash's weapon damage and makes him lose health slower.\n\n\"Evil Dead: Regeneration\" received \"average\" reviews on all platforms, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Adam Dodd of Bloody Disgusting wrote that it is \"probably the best full-scope console game out there in terms of mechanics\" but criticized it for its \"addition of an obnoxious sidekick and way too many tedious escort missions\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1982699", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982699", "title": "The Miracle of Bern", "text": "The Miracle of Bern\n\nThe Miracle of Bern () is a 2003 film by Sönke Wortmann, which tells the story of a German family (particularly of a young boy and his depressed ex-POW father) and the unexpected West German \"miracle\" victory in the 1954 World Cup Final in Bern, Switzerland.\n\nThe film can be regarded as a portrait of post-war Germany. With over 6 million cinema visitors, it is one of Germany's best-selling films. Among those attending the première were Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, Peer Steinbrück, Minister-President of North Rhine-Westphalia, and Otto Schily, Federal Minister of the Interior (a position whose holder is also informally known as Minister for Sports).\n\nSince November 2014, Hamburg's new musical theatre is home to a successful musical production of the same name.\n\nRichard, a coal miner from Essen, returns after eleven years of being a Soviet prisoner of war in Siberia. In the meantime, his wife, two sons, and one daughter have reached a minimum standard of living without him. When he is unexpectedly repatriated in 1954, he has severe problems in reintegrating himself with his family and country. His wife is running a small business, his elder son has become a Communist challenging his father's ideals of the Nazi time, his daughter flirts with British soldiers who are his former enemies, while his 11-year-old son Matthias, who never knew his father, admires a local football hero instead, Helmut Rahn of Rot-Weiß Essen.\n\nWhile Richard is initially very stern about Matthias' love for football, he gradually softens such that, on the night before the final game, father and son drive to Bern to see the match.\n\nAn additional plot of the movie is the personal triumph of Helmut Rahn, for whom Matthias becomes a lucky mascot. Rahn, nicknamed \"The Boss\", has a successful record at club level, though is rarely chosen to play at national level in trainer Sepp Herberger's team.\n\nA third more light-hearted comic relief story line revolves around the fictional sports reporter Paul Ackermann and his wife, who travel to the World Cup despite their fundamentally different views on the importance of football.\n\nThere are several miraculous events in the film. For Richard, it is the sudden joy of scoring a goal with an abandoned football. For Rahn, it is seeing Matthias on the sideline that spurs him into scoring the winning goal. For Sepp Herberger, however, the miracles are more mundane: the sudden rain that slows down the Hungarians (however, German captain Fritz Walter tended to perform better in stormy conditions), but not so much the Germans fitted with Adolf Dassler's revolutionary screw-in football studs. For all Germans, it's the unexpected euphoria of a win that heals many wounds, becoming a symbol of the ongoing economic \"miracle\".\n\n\n\n\nThe 1954 German team, captained by Fritz Walter and coached by Sepp Herberger, won the World Cup in a remarkable final against the legendary Hungarian \"Mighty Magyars\", undefeated for four years (Hungary had even thrashed the German back-ups 8–3 in the group stages). A determined Germany came back from an early two-goal deficit to win 3–2, with Helmut Rahn scoring the winning goal six minutes from the end of full-time. This was a euphoric event for Germany, which had been spiritually and economically shattered by the war. Winning the Jules Rimet Trophy by beating the world's strongest team gave the country new pride and is seen as a herald of Germany's economic and political recovery.\n\n\n"}

It was developed by Sensible Software and published by Ocean Software in 1992. \"Wizkid\" is the official sequel to 1987's \"Wizball\", developed and released by the same companies.\n\nThe story starts after the Wiz and his cat Nifta had restored colours to their world. They were both married (to different spouses, apparently) and had children: the Wiz had a son, Wizkid, and Nifta had eight kittens. All was peaceful and happy until the evil mouse wizard Zark came and kidnapped the Wiz, Nifta, and all the kittens, imprisoning them in different parts of the world. It is Wizkid's job to save them.\n\nThe game takes place over nine levels, each with a different style, background image, and music:\n\nIn each level, the player plays the disembodied head of Wizkid, which can fly around the screen in all four directions. The object is to knock various objects on top of enemies, killing them. When all enemies are killed, play proceeds to the next screen, and after all screens have been completed, proceeds to the next level.\n\nIn the action parts of the game, two bonus objects are on offer - a nose which allows Wizkid to juggle blocks, and teeth allowing him to grip them (they can even be taken to different screens - taking a large block onto a screen with only small blocks can be advantageous). The teeth are temporary, but failing to complete a level sees you lose either item. A bonus \"Crossword 2091\" screen is sometimes activated by failing to complete a level, in which the player is presented with a grid and a sequence of words, which must be arranged so as to interlock into a crossword-style arrangement. Completion of this, which involves a fair amount of trial and error, adds $500 to the bank balance.\n\nThe adventure aspect of the game comes into play when Wizkid manages to collect a whole sequence of bonus musical notes. This allows him to re-embody his head and interact with the background landscape. Items can be bought with money, and must be used throughout the game to collect enough kittens to reach Zark's Castle before Zark can get back. These puzzles often include humorous interludes - for example, on the first level you must distract a vicious-looking dog by giving him a newspaper; moments later he can be seen reading it whilst sitting in an out-house toilet. There is one more mystery task to be completed in order to win the game.\n\n\"Wizkid\" uses the \"level warping\" system from \"Super Mario Bros.\" in reverse. Playing only the arcade part only takes the player to levels 1, 4, 7 and 9. Hidden routes in the adventure part are required to access the other levels, and thus obtain enough kittens to complete the game. Level 3 must be completed in \"head mode\", and it features some of the harder screens.\n\nThe game was ranked the 31st best game of all time by the last Top 100 list of \"Amiga Power\" in 1996.\n\n\"MikroBitti\" magazine (issue 6 of 1992) gave the game 91% rating. Reviewers wrote that the game is highly original and fun but lamented that it is probably excessively strange to become appreciated by wider audiences.\n\nIn 1994, \"PC Gamer UK\" named \"Wizkid\" the 42nd best computer game of all time. The editors called it \"a rare gem that deserves a place in everyone's collection, if only because it's totally unique.\"\n\n"}

During the course of a professional career which ranges over six decades he has served as a faculty member at both the University of Rochester's Eastman School of Music and the Juilliard School. In addition, he is credited with founding and conducting the U.S. Seventh Army's Seventh Army Symphony Orchestra which participated in the cultural diplomacy initiatives of the United States in Germany and throughout Europe in the aftermath of World War II. Adler's musical catalogue includes over 400 published compositions. He has been honored with several awards including Germany's Order of Merit – Officer's Cross. \n\nAdler was born to a Jewish family in Mannheim, Germany, the son of Hugo Chaim Adler, a cantor and composer, and Selma Adler. The family fled to the United States in 1939, where Hugo became the cantor of Temple Emanuel in Worcester, Massachusetts. Sam followed his father into the music profession, earning degrees from Boston University and Harvard University (where he studied with Aaron Copland, Paul Hindemith, Paul Pisk, Walter Piston, and Randall Thompson and earned an M.A. in 1950). He studied conducting with Serge Koussevitzky at Tanglewood in 1949. Adler has been awarded honorary doctorates from Southern Methodist and Wake Forest Universities, St. Mary's College of Notre Dame and the St. Louis Conservatory of Music.\n\nAfter completing his academic studies in 1950, Adler enrolled in the Seventh United States Army as a corporal in the 2nd Armored Division. During this time he founded the Seventh Army Symphony Orchestra (1952) in Stuttgart, Germany which served to demonstrate the shared cultural heritage of America and Europe in the post World War II era through cultural diplomacy. For this, he received a special Citation of Excellence from the Army for the orchestra's success between 1952 and 1961. Subsequently, he accepted a position as music director at Temple Emanu-El in Dallas, Texas, beginning his tenure there in 1953. At the Dallas temple he formed a children's choir and an adult choir. From 1954 to 1958 Adler conducted the Dallas Lyric Theater. From 1957 to 1966, Adler served as Professor of Composition at the University of North Texas College of Music. Between 1966 and 1995, Adler served as Professor of Composition at the University of Rochester's Eastman School of Music. Since 1997, Adler has been a member of the composition faculty at Juilliard and, for the 2009–10 year, was awarded the William Schuman Scholars Chair.\n\nHe is also the author of three books, \"Choral Conducting\" (Holt Rinehart and Winston 1971, second edition Schirmer Books 1985), \"Sight Singing\" (W.W. Norton 1979, 1997), and \"The Study of Orchestration\" (W.W. Norton 1982, 1989, 2001; Italian edition edited by Lorenzo Ferrero for EDT Srl Torino, 2008). He has also contributed numerous articles to major magazines, books and encyclopedias published in the U.S. and abroad. Adler also reflected upon six decades of teaching in his memoirs \"Building Bridges with Music: Stories from a Composer's Life\" which was published by Pendragon Press in 2017.\n\nOver the decades Adler's musical legacy has been interpreted by several orchestral ensembles including: the Cleveland Chamber Symphony, Esterhazy Quartet, the Latvian National Symphony Orchestra, Brandenburgisches Staatsorchester Frankfurt and the Bowling Green Philharmonia. In more recent times his works have also been showcased by leading orchestras around the world including: the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Mannheim National Theatre Orchestra, and the St. Louis Symphony. Performances of his compositions have been recorded on several record labels including: Albany Records, Linn Records, Navona Records, and Naxos Records.\n\nAdler is married to Emily Freeman Brown who is currently serving as Music Director and Conductor of the Bowling Green Philharmonia.\n\nMusicologists have noted that Adler's works incorporate a wide range of compositional techniques including: free atonality, diatonicism, and serialism. In addition, he is recognized for interweaving dance rhythms, folk themes, ostinati and devices associated with aleatoric music throughout his scores.\n\nAdler has been awarded many prizes, including a membership into the American Academy in Berlin (2004) and Institute of Arts and Letters awarded in May 2001, the Charles Ives Award and the Lillian Fairchild Award. In May, 2003, he was presented with the Aaron Copland Award by ASCAP for Lifetime Achievement in Music (Composition and Teaching). In 2008 he was inducted into the American Classical Music Hall of Fame. In 1999, he was elected to the Academy of Arts, Berlin for distinguished service to music. In 1983, he won the Deems Taylor Award for his book on orchestration; in 1984, he was appointed Honorary Professorial Fellow of the University College in Cardiff, Wales, and was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for 1984–85. He has been a MacDowell Fellow for five years between 1954 and 1963. In 1986 he received the \"Distinguished Alumni Award\" from Boston University.\n\nThe Music Teachers' National Association selected Adler as its \"Composer of the Year 1986–87\" for \"Quintalogues\", which won the national competition. In the 1988–89 year, he has been designated \"Phi Beta Kappa Visiting Scholar.\" In 1989, he was awarded The Eastman School's Eisenhart Award for distinguished teaching, and he has been given the honor of Composer of the Year (1991) for the American Guild of Organists. During his second visit to Chile, Adler was elected to the Chilean Academy of Fine Arts (1993) \"for his outstanding contributions to the world of music as composer, conductor, and author.\" He was initiated as an honorary member of the Gamma Theta (1960, University of North Texas) and the Alpha Alpha (1966, National Honorary) chapters of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, and in 1986 was named a National Arts Associate to Sigma Alpha Iota, international music fraternity for women. In 1998, he was awarded the Brock Commission from the American Choral Directors Association.\n\nIn May, 2018, Adler was awarded the German \"Bundesverdienstkreuz 1. Klasse\" (Order of Merit – Officer's Cross), presented to him in New York by Consul General David Gill. On June 1, 2018, Adler was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters and presented the graduation address at Hebrew Union College - Jewish Institute of Religion's Cincinnati graduation ceremony.\n\nAdler's catalogue includes over 400 published works in all media, including three operas, six symphonies, ten string quartets, at least eleven concerti (organ, piano, violin, viola or clarinet, cello, flute, guitar, saxophone quartet, woodwind quintet), many shorter orchestral works, works for wind ensemble and band, chamber music, a great deal of choral music, liturgical music, and songs.\n\nSince 1997 he has been a member of the composition faculty at the Juilliard School in New York City.

This allows a great amount of legacy code to be reused without modification in new applications. While less powerful than the newer AT90 series of AVR RISC microcontrollers, new product development has continued with the AT89 series for the aforementioned advantages.\n\nMore recently, the AT89 series has been augmented with 8051-cored special function microcontrollers, specifically in the areas of USB, I²C (two wire interface), SPI and CAN bus controllers, MP3 decoders and hardware PWM.\n\nAtmel has also created an LP (low power) series of these chips with a \"Single Cycle Core\", making the execution speed of these chips considerably faster.\n\nAll four ports in the AT89C51 and AT89C52 are bidirectional. Each consists of a latch (Special Function Registers P0 through P3), an output driver, and an input buffer. The output drivers of Ports 0 and 2, and the input buffers of Port 0, are used in accesses to external memory. In this application, Port 0 outputs the low byte of the external memory address, time-multiplexed with the byte being written or read. Port 2 outputs the high byte of the external memory address when the address is 16 bits wide. Otherwise the Port 2 pins continue to emit the P2 SFR content. All the Port 3 pins, and two Port 1 pins (in the AT89C52)are multifunctional. The alternate functions can only be activated if the corresponding bit latch in the port SFR contains a 1.

He grew up in Philadelphia, and spent his life there in a home at the corner of 3rd and Lombard. Like his siblings (almost all of whom were named after famous artists or scientists), Raphaelle was trained by his father as an artist. Early in his career, the pair collaborated on portraits. On some commissions, Raphaelle painted miniatures while his brother, Rembrandt, painted full-size portraits.\n\nIn 1793, he made a trip to South America in order to collect specimens for the Peale Museum founded by his father. He exhibited five portraits and eight other paintings, probably still lifes, at the Columbianum, Philadelphia in 1794. His first professional exhibition was in 1795 at the age of 21. In 1797, with his brother Rembrandt, he traveled to Charleston, South Carolina, where they attempted to establish another museum. The plan fell through, however, and Raphaelle returned to painting miniatures.\n\nHe married Martha (Patty) McGlathery at the age of twenty, and with her had eight children. For about two years beginning in 1803, Peale toured Virginia with the \"physiognotrace\", a profile making machine, with which he was briefly successful. By 1806 he had begun to suffer the symptoms of arsenic and mercury poisoning brought on by his work as a taxidermist in his father's museum. In August 1809 he was hospitalized with delirium, and for the rest of his life he suffered debilitating attacks almost yearly—which his father ascribed to \"gout of the stomach\" caused by consumption of pickles and excessive drinking. From 1810, Peale concentrated on still-life painting almost exclusively, becoming America's first professional still-life painter, and he exhibited frequently at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and elsewhere, especially from 1814–18. By 1813, he was unable to walk without crutches. After the downturn in his health, in an era when most artists considered still life a subject worthy only of amateurs, he devoted himself almost exclusively to still life painting. It is for these works he is best known. His work was on frequent exhibit at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts between 1814 and 1818. After reportedly indulging in a night of heavy drinking, his health destroyed, he died on March 4, 1825, at age 51 at his home in Philadelphia.\n\nAlfred Frankenstein has called Raphaelle Peale \"the first really distinguished still-life specialist to emerge in this country, and he is one of the four major still-life painters of the nineteenth century in the United States.\" His style may have been influenced by Spanish still life paintings he saw on his trip to Mexico and by the two works by Juan Sanchez Cotan, exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy in 1816. Most of Peale's paintings are small in scale, and depict a few objects—usually foodstuffs—arranged on a tabletop before a darkened background. A notable exception is his \"trompe l'oeil\", \"Venus Rising from the Sea—A Deception\" (also entitled \"After the Bath,\" 1822, in the collection of the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art).\n\nIt was his nephew George Escol Sellers's opinion that Raphaelle Peale was the most talented of Charles Wilson Peale's artist children and that \"it was the Revolution that made him the wreck he was\".\n\n\n\n"}

She has been Honorary Professor at the Institute for Global Prosperity at University College London since 2014. She also acts as SiriusXM's chief Europe correspondent. In 2001 \"The Observer\" newspaper dubbed her \"one of the world's leading young thinkers\" and \"Vogue\" magazine described her as \"one of the most inspiring women in the world.\". In September 2013 Hertz was featured on the cover of \" Newsweek\" Magazine. Describing herself as \"a campaigning academic\", critics have called her \"a do-gooder who moves like a grasshopper from one high-profile good cause to another.\" She has been called the \"Nigella Lawson of economics\" by the UK media,\"because she combines striking beauty with a formidable mind.\" \"Fast Company\" magazine has named her \"one of the most influential economists on the international stage\" and observed: \"For more than two decades [her] economic predictions have been accurate and ahead of the curve.\" Vivienne Westwood has said of her writing: \"That is what punk was all about\".\n\nHertz's books are published in 22 languages.\n\nHertz is a great-granddaughter of British Chief Rabbi Joseph H. Hertz, and was born and brought up in East Finchley, London. When she was 20 years old, her mother, the fashion designer and feminist activist Leah Hertz, died of cancer.\n\nHertz was a precocious child and began her schooling aged just 3 years, taking her A levels at age 16. She first attended North London Collegiate School followed by Westminster School. She graduated from University College London in philosophy and economics at the age of 18. She then attended The Wharton School, Philadelphia, where she majored in finance and earned her MBA at age 21. Hertz then worked for a short period at Triad Artists, a talent agency in Los Angeles, California, where she originally planned to break into the film industry as a producer, before taking up a position as a consultant for the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Disillusioned by what she perceived as failings in the World Bank's approach to post-Soviet reforms, she quit her post and worked briefly for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Of the IFC, she said: \"Early on I raised the issue of social safety nets and was quite shocked to see how clearly my concerns were dismissed.\" Having returned to the UK she studied for a PhD in economics and business at King's College, Cambridge. Her Cambridge doctoral thesis, \"Russian Business Relationships in the Wake of Reform\" was published in 1997 by St. Martin's Press.\n\nIn \"The Silent Takeover: Global Capitalism and the Death of Democracy\" Hertz warned that unregulated markets, corporate greed, and over-powerful financial institutions would have serious global consequences that would impact most heavily on the ordinary citizen. Hertz received a record six-figure advance from Random House for the book which, in pre-publicity, she promised would \"make economics sexy.\" Although the book became a bestseller, it was not well-received when first published. Francis Beckett, for \"The Independent\", later observed that the book \"was lavishly praised and savagely attacked in equal measure\" but had nevertheless \"launched her as a new sort of thinker - the first prominent British radical left winger to come out of the business schools.\" Howard Davies, reviewing it for London's \"The Guardian\" newspaper, dismissed it as \"globaloney\", written in \"a style beloved of airport-newsstand business books: random statistic piled on borrowed anecdote, larded with a bit of homespun cod philosophy, shaken not stirred.\"\n\nTariq Ali, for \"The Independent\", called the book \"well-intentioned\" but \"a much milder version [of] three more vigorous North American texts that have already achieved cult status\" (Naomi Klein's \"No Logo\", Thomas Frank's \"One Market Under God\" and Kalle Lasn's \"Culture Jam\".) Ali characterised it as neoliberal, \"Third Way anti-capitalism\" and concluded \"What Hertz really wants is a government that can unite business interests with those of ordinary people - like expecting homoeopathic drops to cure a cancer.\"\n\nWill Self described the book as \"superficially readable\" but was critical of Hertz's ideology, calling it \"an aggressive questioning of the pernicious status quo, but with only a febrile grasp on any potential solution - what used to be expected of a precocious adolescent, rather than a Cambridge assistant professor entering her mid-thirties.\"\n\nFrank Fitzgibbon, for \"The Sunday Times\", described it as \"well-written, colourful and sometimes entertaining\" but ultimately \"one long whinge, full of hackneyed observations... like a 212-page \"Guardian\" editorial on the venality of politicians, the evils of big business and the right-on credentials of concerned citizens.\" Responding to the book's advance publicity which said \"The Silent Takeover\" \"provides a new and startling take on the way we live now\", Fitzgibbon observed: \"With the possible exception of a quote from Bhutan's king, Jigme Singye Wangchuck - \"gross national happiness is more important than gross national product\" - there is nothing in this book that is not already known to anybody with a passing interest in business and current affairs. It has all been said before but, to her credit, Hertz says it with style and with her telegenic looks she should be in demand on the chat-show circuit.\"\n\nJennifer Szalai, for the \"New Statesman\", wrote that the book was \"at best, an anaemic objection to global capitalism\" and pointed out: \"For anybody who has read anything about corporations beyond their annual reports... the examples in this book are nothing new.\" Szalai described Hertz's \"line of argument\" as \"a listless string of tired phrases, exposing her apparent ambivalence on the subject.\"\n\n\"IOU: The Debt Threat and Why We Must Defuse It\" comprised a study of debt in developing countries and provided Hertz's blueprint for development. Paul Kingsnorth, reviewing for the \"New Statesman\", wrote: \"Noreena is the Joanne Harris of political writing - and \"IOU\", like its author, is all style and no substance.\" Kingsnorth said that her explanation of the debt issue was: \"All fine, but also largely redundant, because this stuff has been circulating for years, and Hertz adds nothing new to the mix.\" He also found sections of the book \"misleading\" and noted that \"her old employer the World Bank emerges with a curiously positive report card from a book about a problem it created almost single-handedly. The bank's former chief economist Larry Summers is represented as a passionate champion of the poor. Perhaps Hertz is not aware of the infamous internal memo that was leaked from the bank, in which this angelic man wrote: \"I think the economic logic behind dumping a load of toxic waste in the lowest-wage country is impeccable and we should face up to that... I've always thought that underpopulated countries in Africa are vastly underpolluted...\"\" He dismissed the book as simply \"going through the motions\" and \"remarkably bad writing.\"\n\nRichard Adams, for \"The Guardian\", wrote: \"There is nothing here that will surprise readers of Susan George's 1988 book \"A Fate Worse than Debt\", which remains the most forceful call for undoing the burden of the developing world.\" Hertz's proposed solutions were, he wrote, not well defined. \"Some of her suggestions are patronising - setting up panels of international \"overseers\" for aid funding is a bit rich given her diatribes against external IMF and World Bank meddling - while one is downright dangerous: that wealthy nations hypothecate the taxes paid by immigrant workers for use as overseas aid (so removing their last shield against the xenophobe or racist, that they too pay taxes for the NHS).\" Adams also found the book \"littered with errors... that smack of economic illiteracy and careless research.\" Of her style, he observed: \"Readers may also be unimpressed with Hertz's informal prose style and strangled syntax... The first chapter, especially, reads like a rejected screenplay for an unhappy episode of \"The West Wing\".\" Adams concluded his review by writing: \"While no one can doubt Hertz's good intentions, the road to hell is paved with books like \"IOU\". Developing-world debt is a serious issue, and it deserves more judicious treatment than this.\"\n\nDiane Coyle, for \"The Independent\", called \"IOU\" \"another pamphlet disguised as a book\" and opined that \"It pretends to weigh up the details and evidence, but its tone implies that anyone who disagrees is stupid or bad... HIV/Aids, the loss of Amazon rainforests and terrorism [are not] caused by these debts, which is the facile claim Hertz makes.\"\n\nDesmond Tutu credited the book with a \"remarkable clarity\" and said it \"puts forward clear recommendations that can and must be taken.\" Writing for the \"New Statesman\" he declared: \"\"IOU\" should not go unnoticed. When the truth is told about international debt, then we can begin to overcome the scandalous debt slavery of the world's poor.\" Hannah Betts, for \"The Times\", labelled the book \"more than liberal breast-beating - it endeavours to be a psychology of debt... Without ever falling into the pat illiberalisms that the West brought 9/11 and its aftermath on itself, Hertz discusses the ways in which terrorism, disease and ecological meltdown may be the consequences of Third World stagnation.\"\n\n\"Eyes Wide Open\" \"takes issue with the rise and rise of unchecked data, and suggests simple solutions to allow her readers to take control of their lives.\" The book has received praise from prominent social psychologists and best-selling authors, including Robert Cialdini, author of \"Influence\". He writes; \"With 10 sensible steps to take, Noreena Hertz charts a sound decision-making route for us through a world in hyper-drive. I’d recommend a prudent first step-get this book\". John Crace, reviewing for \"The Guardian\", wrote: \"Every week, another 150 self-help books are published. How do you know this one is any different from the others? It isn't.\" He summarised the book as \"Eyes fast closing.\" \"The Guardian's\" media commentator, 'Media Monkey', wrote: \"Assuming he follows his wife's tips, [Danny] Cohen will usually sport noise-reducing headphones; use a meditation app to gauge his own feelings; avoid having to make distracting non-important choices by always buying-eating-wearing-doing the same thing; go for lots of pre-crunchtime walks; ensure he's neither sex- nor sleep-starved; and only take decisions on a full stomach and bladder. A potentially problematic requirement for someone whose job entails scores of decisions a day.\"\nToby Young, for the \"Mail on Sunday\", wrote: \"Her aim is to alert us to myriad ways in which irrational factors influence our decisions. Some suggestions fall into the category of the 'bleedin' obvious' - we're told not to follow the crowd and to get second and third opinions on our health - but for the most part, her advice is excellent and surprising.\" Daisy Goodwin, for the \"Sunday Times\", wrote: \"[A]lthough it is written in the adjective- and bulletpoint-heavy style of the airport book, it is actually a practical guide to critical thinking in the digital age that is as useful for students as it is for CEOs.\" Despite finding the book \"slightly exhausting\", she concluded it was \"an admirable guide to predicting the factors that affect our decision-making.\"\n\nJulian Baggini, for the \"Financial Times\", was more critical, observing: \"[T]he more confidently a book claims to help you make better choices, the less it is likely to do so. Noreena Hertz's \"Eyes Wide Open\" is a case in point. Reading it, I did, indeed, often find myself wide-eyed, startled by its bold, simplistic claims. There is a need for a synthesis of the many insights gathered by recent research into cognitive biases and the other often hidden processes that shape our decisions. Unfortunately for Hertz, the distinguished psychologist Daniel Kahneman has already written it. His \"Thinking, Fast and Slow\" (2011) is sober, measured, rigorous and practical, all things \"Eyes Wide Open\" is not... Hertz ends up sounding like a physician who is not just unable to heal herself but intent on ingesting all the toxins she warns others about.\"\n\nIn 2015 Professor Hertz began researching what she has called Generation K - 13- to 20-year-olds. K is for Katniss Everdeen, the feisty heroine of the global franchise The Hunger Games. Noreena presented her initial thinking on Generation K in 2015 at the World Economic Forum and at the \"Women in the World Summit\" in New York City. Here she unveiled results from her 2015 study of 2000 American and British Teenagers. Key findings include that this Generation is more anxious than previous ones, more intent on being unique, and more concerned about inequality. She posits that they have been profoundly shaped not only by technology but also by the recession and an increasing sense of existential threat. She writes \"unlike those currently aged between 20 and 30, the “Yes we can” generation, who grew up believing the world was their oyster, for Generation K the world is less oyster, more Hobbesian nightmare.\"\n\nGeneration K (also known as \"Gen K\" or Post-Millennials) is the term given to the age group born between 1994 and 2005. The label was coined by author, economist and strategist Professor Noreena Hertz who is one of the world's most foremost researchers on this demographic. She first mooted her initial findings on Generation K at the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2015.\nHertz defines this generation as having been profoundly shaped by three global forces: the rapid development of technology – this is the first smartphone generation, the worst recession the West faced in decades, and the increased existential threat from evolving terrorist groups.\nAccording to her, distinct traits of Generation K include anxiety, loneliness, a desire for connection, a desire to co-create, a commitment to societal equality, anti-traditional institutions, commitment to the environment and fear about their own financial futures.\nProfessor Hertz's research into Generation K has been discussed in publications including The Guardian, The Financial Times, El Pais, The Washington Post, The Daily Telegraph, Campaign, The Huffington Post, and Newsweek.\n\nIn 2009, Hertz was appointed Professor and chair of Globalisation, Sustainability and Finance at the Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University and the Duisenberg School of Finance.\n\nPreviously she held the Belle van Zuylen Professorship at the University of Utrecht, and was the Miliband fellow at the London School of Economics.\n\nShe is a fellow of the University of Cambridge's Judge Business School.\n\nShe is Honorary Professor at University College London.\n\nOn 19 May 2016, it was announced that Hertz was joining ITV News as its Economics Editor.\n\nHertz also played a key role in the Live 8 campaign to cancel the debt of the world's poorest countries, and was one of the speakers at the Edinburgh Live 8 concert.\n\nIn April 2007 Hertz launched the Mayday for Nurses campaign in Britain to alleviate the problems of low pay in nursing. Hertz promised nurses at the Royal College of Nursing annual conference that she would make sure that every football player in the Premier League would, by the end of the season, have donated one day's pay (totalling around £1.5 million) to a hardship fund for nurses struggling in their first few years. The campaign was filmed for a Channel 4 documentary, \"The Million Pound Footballers' Giveaway\", broadcast on 7 June 2007.\n\nAlthough the Nurses’ hardship fund raised £750,000 after some of the Premiership's best-paid stars pitched in with a day's pay, the campaign received a \"mixed response\" and was described by some commentators as \"intellectually flawed\" and \"a thinly-veiled form of blackmail.\" Gareth Southgate, then the manager of Middlesbrough F.C., cancelled his club's donation after Hertz published a list of footballers who had contributed, \"effectively 'outing' those who had not.\" Southgate said: \"I am disgusted with the manner in which this campaign has gone about its fundraising. Mayday for Nurses is a worthy cause, but there are many others. The players at this club support any number of local and national charities and good causes, either via financial support, giving up their own time or both. This is often done privately, meaning they neither receive nor ask for any public gratitude or praise.\" Moritz Volz, then playing for Fulham F.C., explained in \"The Times\": \"Everyone in our squad decided to donate a day's pay to the Mayday for Nurses appeal. But [Hertz's] ignorance [of football and the media] is what caused it to backfire. Instead of focusing on poor pay for nurses, the media coverage ended up being primarily about footballers and their money.\".\n\nPeter Carter, the general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said that the fund offered financial support and \"a helping hand to nurses in times of hardship and times of need.\" Hertz said she picked nurses to be the beneficiaries of the campaign because they were among the worst paid public servants with professional qualifications, earning one-third less than teachers by the time they are established in their careers.\n\nHertz acts in an advisory capacity for \"major multinational corporations, CEOs, NGOs and politicians, as well as start-up companies, and sits on various corporate and charitable boards.\" She is a member of the Inclusive Capitalism Task Force, chaired by Dominic Barton, Global Managing Director of McKinsey & Company. She is also an advisor to the Centre for the Analysis of Social Media and a Trustee of the Institute for Public Policy Research. In May 2014 Hertz joined the board of Warner Music Group.\n\nHertz is married to Danny Cohen, the former Director of BBC Television. They were married in 2012 at the Bevis Marks Synagogue in the City of London. The ceremony was conducted by Lord Sacks, the Chief Rabbi, and attended by guests including Rachel Weisz, Nigella Lawson and Charles Saatchi. She lives with her husband in Primrose Hill, London.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1982740", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982740", "title": "Magnepan", "text": "Magnepan\n\nMagnepan is a private high-end audio loudspeaker manufacturer in White Bear Lake, Minnesota, United States. Their loudspeaker technology was conceived and implemented by engineer Jim Winey in 1969.\n\nMagnepan's speaker design, sold under the brand name Magneplanar (often referred to as \"Maggies\"), differs from that of conventional speakers in relying not on cones mounted in an enclosure but on a planar driver system mounted in a panel. A Magneplanar's reproducing mechanism comprises thin conductive wires and or foil strips attached to a thin sheet of Mylar residing in a magnetic field created by a vertical array of permanent strip magnets. When an amplified signal is applied to the conductors, the resultant electrical forces react with the magnetic field to excite the Mylar film sheet, which projects sound as a dipole. In principle, this approach relies on the same concept as a voice coil-driven cone speaker, but in a Magneplanar speaker the \"voice coils\" are attached (glued) directly to the radiating surface.\n\nSound is projected from both the front and back of the radiating surface. The sound from the back of the speaker is reflected from the front wall of the listening area. This is said to effectively enhance the soundstage - the sense of space and realism - of the speaker. The Magneplanar design, using a passive magnet array, is not a unique loudspeaker implementation, although it was the first of its type. Eminent Technology, Analysis Audio, and others also employ passive magnet designs. Broadly, these are classed as planar-magnetic speakers.\n\nThere are other similar speaker designs to the Magneplanar. Martin-Logan and Quad Electroacoustics, among others, make electrostatic loudspeakers, which are another variation on the dipole model. Electrostatic speakers operate on a somewhat different principle. While the voice coils in the Magneplanar are conductive wires or foil strips mounted on a sheet of Mylar film, electrostatic speakers suspend a charged conductive film between two grids (stators) which move the film. One disadvantage of both designs is that a very large panel is required to produce deep bass. Magnepan has addressed this via the physical size of the speakers - a physically large radiating surface produces more bass. Martin-Logan has addressed the bass problem by mounting a conventional cone bass driver in a separate section of the speaker chassis, generally resulting in a physically smaller speaker than the Magneplanar.\n\nMagnepan has used a few different technologies in constructing their speakers. All Magnepan speakers are based on flexible ferrite magnet strips (like refrigerator magnets), 0.060\" (1.5mm) thick, typically cut to either 1/4\" wide (mid-bass) or 1/8\" wide (tweeters) and more or less the length of the speaker. The magnets are glued to a piece of custom perforated 20 gauge steel sheet. The steel supports the magnets and also completes the magnetic circuit on the back of the magnets, resulting in about a 25% stronger magnetic field in front of the magnets. Mylar film .0005\" (12.5um) thick is suspended in front of the magnet structure about 1/16\" away from the magnets. Aluminum wires or film are then glued to the mylar. Always aluminum: copper has two-thirds the resistance of aluminum which would make the speakers either much larger or much more difficult to drive. Very few amplifiers can handle 2.7 ohm speakers. Older Magnepans used aluminum magnet wire, thin 31 gauge .0089\" for the tweeters and thicker 22 gauge .0253\" for the mid-bass. The wire is glued to the mylar with 3M 77 spray adhesive then sealed with 3M Fastbond 30NF (Magnepan used to use Milloxane to seal, but no more.)\n\nNewer Magnepans use 30 um (.0012\") thick 1/8\" wide aluminum tape instead of wire. When the aluminum tape is used instead of wires Magnepan calls the speakers \"Quasi-Ribbons.\" Using the aluminum tape spreads out the driving force on the mylar speaker diaphragm, resulting in noticeably lower distortion. Cutaway picture: Magnepan Quasi Ribbon \n\nMagnepan ribbons are constructed with a strip of aluminum roughly 5um (.0002\") thick, 1/4\" wide, 60\" (1.5m) long. The aluminum is corrugated - the pleats help keep the ribbon from flexing between the magnets. Before corrugating the ribbon it's more like 80\" (2m) long. The aluminum is suspended between two ferrite magnets, about 3/8\" x 1/2\" in cross section. The magnets are attached to a 1/8\" thick piece of formed and perforated steel, which both holds the magnets in place and also completes the magnetic circuit, resulting in about a 40% stronger magnetic field in the magnet gap. Cutaway picture: Magnepan Ribbon\n\nThe most frequently cited disadvantages of Magnepan's overall design are relatively low efficiency and, given the absence of an enclosure, difficulty in reproducing very low bass frequencies. Because of the low resistance (4 ohms) and low sensitivity (86dB), it requires a surprising amount of current to drive the Magnepans to moderately loud listening levels. Many inexpensive receivers simply do not have the required current capacity so they go into various distortion modes including crossover distortion, clipping and slew limiting, with the result that the Magnepans may not sound very good. If the amplifier starts clipping it could destroy the ribbon or treble wiring. Driving the Magnepans with a 100 watt or better high current amplifier will result in much better sound. Many very expensive modern amplifiers can do this, and some older amplifiers including the Great American Sound Ampzillas and the various Sumo amplifiers can too - these amplifiers were all designed by James Bonjiorno, who was a big believer in high current capabilities. Generally the amplifier should put out double the watts into 4 ohms that it does into 8 ohms; if the specification is for less than double then the power supply and/or output stage of the amplifier will most likely not be sufficient to obtain best sound from the Magnepans.\n\nOriginally Magnepan sold the MG and the Tympani series. The Tympani series has been discontinued for several decades, and is replaced by the 20.7 and 30.7 speakers. The MG series has been produced continuously but the \"MG\" has been dropped from the name; thus the MG-I is now the 1.7; the MG-II is now the (discontinued) 2.7, and the MG-III is now the 3.7. Magnepan also produced a small, relatively inexpensive speaker, the SMG, which became the MMG and is now called the LRS. The Tympanis and MG speakers were all made from wire-on-mylar; the speakers with no \"MG\" in the name are all made from aluminum foil on mylar (\"Quasi-Ribbon\"). The MG-III, 3.7, Tympani IV, 20.7 and 30.7 all include Magnepan's ribbon driver and thus produce sound up to 40khz. The other speakers do not include a true ribbon and therefore produce sound only up to about 18khz - 25khz.\n\nAll Magnepans are 4 ohm speakers, with sensitivity of 86dB / 500Hz / 2.83v\n\n\n\n"}

During a period, this manor house had one of the richest plantations in Chincha, with around 1000 slaves working on its fields.\n\nThe hacienda suffered great damage after the 2007 Peru earthquake that hit the central Peruvian coast on August 15, 2007. The hotel chain Casa Andina purchased the property and conducted extensive renovations (which began in 2009). Finally, the hotel reopened for guests in 2012.\n\nThe first news about San José Manor House dates back to 1688 when Rosa Josepha de Muñatones y Aguado married Don Andrés Salazar. As a dowry, she brought into the marriage the Manor House and its church along with a farmland located on the Chincha Valley. It was later transformed into a sugar plantation that held 87 black slaves. Sugarcane yielded two of the sweetest and most valued products in those times: sugar and honey.\n\nIn 1764, a new marriage strengthened the San José Manor House property: the daughter of Don Agustín de Salazar y Muñatones, Rosa Salazar Gaviño, married Don Fernando Carrillo de Albornoz y Bravo Lagunas. They both bought San Regis Manor House, which originally belonged to the Jesuits. This union made both properties one of the richest in all Chincha. Over 1 000 slaves worked the lands producing sugarcane and cotton. El Carmen village dates back to those times (1811), where many slaves used to hide, escaping from the extensive abuse they had on the plantations.\n\nIn 1821, Fernando Carrillo de Albornoz y Salazar, son of Fernando and Rosa's, was the owner of both San José and San Regis manor houses. The Chincha Valley was shocked to see General Don José de San Martin and his troops disembarking at Pisco. Some slaves managed to escape the plantations to join the Libertador's troops, and Fernando Carillo de Albornoz y Salazar fled to Spain with two of his children, abandoning both his wife, Petronila Zavala and his youngest son, José. The Government took possession of the manor house and lands right after the defection; however, Petronila Zavala regained possession of her house in 1827.\n\nEventually, San José Manor House recovered from the hardships of the Independence movement. Slavery was abolished in Peru in 1854; however, a great number of slaves were still working on the plantations. Fernando Carrillo de Albornoz y Zavala, Fernando and Petronila's eldest son, inherited the property and imported a vapor tractor from Europe.\n\nThe last heir of Fernando Carrillo de Albornoz y Zavala and Catalina Mendoza's, Julio Carrillo de Albornoz y Mendoza (aged 25) was assassinated by slaves on the main staircase of the manor house during the Pacific War. Right after his death in 1879, the house was sold by his widow, Catalina del Valle y Osma, to Roberto B. Leguía, the President's brother. In 1913, the house was sold by the latter to Manuela Eguren, Cilloniz's widow.\n\nManuela Eguren, Cilloniz's widow and her 12 children lived years of prosperity at the manor house. A cotton gin was built and the cotton was exported to England directly from Tambo the Mora harbor in Chincha. Cattle was also acquired to sell the meat.\n\nIn 1960, after the Agrarian Law was passed, during the first mandate of President Fernando Belaunde, the lands were split among Manuela Eguren's children. The lands were acquired by Don Julio Cilloniz Eguren, one of ManueIa's sons. who in turn passed them on to his 4 children: Julio, Augusto. German and Amelia Cilloniz Garfias, each one inheriting 150 has. In 1968 Augusto died and his widow, Doña Angela Benavides de Cilloniz bought the Manor House from his brothers-in-law. She remains the owner to these days. In 1970, the manor house was declared a World Heritage site.\n"}

A wide range of other legislation was allocated to them as time went on.\n\nThey now deal with more diverse issues under a wide variety of Acts, Orders and Codes of Practice, as set out by central government, working with a number of other regulatory bodies such as the Food Standards Agency and the Office for Product Safety and Standards. Such legislation includes the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008, the Consumer Protection Act 1987, the Food Safety Act 1990, the Price Marking Order 2004 and the Consumer Rights Act 2015. Trading Standards also work with APHA and DEFRA to ensure disease controls are in place protecting residents and agriculture in the UK.\n\nRecent priorities include prevention of sales of counterfeit goods, sales of tobacco and alcohol to under-age buyers, and action to prevent exploitation of vulnerable consumers by scams and doorstep crime. In 2017, the Trading Standards of Somerset, Devon and Torbay donated 5,000 items of counterfeit clothes to the charity Planet Zero after the clothes were seized and rebranded.\n\nTrading Standards can work together with other regulators and national supporting regulators to provide businesses with access to tailored advice and support.

Fluent in French, he studied at the Institut des Sciences Politiques and was awarded the French Legion of Honor in 1989.\n\nAfter President Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law in 1972, Benigno and other foreign journalists established the Foreign Correspondents Association of the Philippines, which proved a welcome balancing force to the Marcos-controlled media during martial rule. Benigno himself, unlike many other prominent anti-Marcos journalists such as Max Soliven and Don Chino Roces avoided imprisonment during Marcos's rule, shielded perhaps in part by his affiliation with a prominent international news organization as the AFP was. \n\nIn 1987, Benigno accepted President Corazon Aquino's offer to serve as her press secretary. He held the position until 1989, when he resigned to return to journalism. In June 1989, he began his famous column \"Here's the Score\", published by the Philippine Star. Benigno would also venture into broadcast journalism by hosting two public-affairs talk shows. The first, \"Options\" on the ABS-CBN channel, was short-lived. However, his succeeding show, \"Firing Line\" on the GMA channel, would prove durable and eventually attain international recognition. \"Firing Line\" deviated from the then popular round-table format adopted by most Philippine talk shows. It employed instead a format involving Benigno and his co-host grilling for an hour a solitary guest, normally a leading Filipino political figure of the day like Miriam Defensor-Santiago in 1992, but sometimes the occasional foreign dignitary such as Margaret Thatcher, Henry Kissinger, Willy Brandt, and Zbigniew Brzezinski. Benigno's co-hosts were also, as he was, former Aquino government officials - first, Executive Secretary Oscar Orbos, then eventually, economic planning secretary Solita Monsod. After the cancellation of \"Firing Line\", Benigno continued to write his column with the Philippine Star, which was regularly published for nearly sixteen years up until weeks before his death.\n\nBenigno employed a highly literary style, replete with flowery descriptions and emphatic denunciations. His emotive style contrasted sharply with the dry stylings of Amado Doronilla, another contemporary of equal stature who writes for the Star's fiercest rival, the Philippine Daily Inquirer. Benigno's writing style became especially pointed in the last few years of his life, as he emerged as a bitter critic of Presidents Joseph Estrada and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. He was frequently heard to lament the failings of the restored democratic rule, and became active in controversial reformist movements.\n\nHe was married to Dominga \"Meng\" Comsti-Benigno (May 12, 1925 – December 13, 2010), with whom he had a daughter, Aurora Magdalena \"Nena\" C. Benigno. At a later time, he had a son named Marc Theodore by Luz Palacios.\n\nBenigno died on 3 June 2005, less than a month after being diagnosed with liver cancer. Former President Aquino, with whom he retained a close personal friendship, was one of his last bedside visitors.\n\n\n\n"}

He first worked in rugby league before beginning a coaching career in association football. His son, Lionel Harbin, briefly played rugby league in the Super League for the Wakefield Trinity Wildcats.\n\nBorn in 1947 at Hazlewood Castle in the English county of Yorkshire, Harbin grew up in Swillington Common, before emigrating with his parents to Australia at the age of ten, settling in Queensland. As a child he played rugby league and was a boxer. After leaving school he completed a teaching degree.\n\nHarbin returned to England to coach in rugby league in the late 1990s. He was appointed head coach of Wakefield Trinity Wildcats in November 2000. The club had financial problems and were expected to struggle. Wakefield Trinity Wildcats' final game of the 2001 season was a relegation battle with Salford City Reds and Wakefield Trinity Wildcats won, condemning Huddersfield Giants to the drop. However, he left the club at the end of 2001.\n\nAfter a brief spell as Chief Executive Officer at Dewsbury Rams, Harbin joined Oldham as head coach in January 2002.\n\nLate in 2002 Harbin joined Oldham Athletic as fitness conditioner and sports psychologist alongside then-assistant manager Iain Dowie. Dowie was later promoted to manager and moved to Crystal Palace, with Harbin following.\n\nDowie moved to Charlton Athletic in 2006, and again appointed Harbin to his coaching staff. After Dowie's sacking in November 2006, Harbin stayed briefly under new manager Les Reed, but departed by the end of 2006. In February 2007 he linked up with Dowie for the fourth time, at Coventry City. Striker Leon Best said that after Harbin's fitness sessions he felt he was \"definitely the fittest I have ever been\". A year later he was placed in a joint-caretaker's role alongside first-team coach Frankie Bunn after the sacking of Dowie. Harbin again followed Iain Dowie to Queens Park Rangers and remained following Dowie's departure in October 2008. Harbin stayed at Loftus Road under new manager Paulo Sousa until Sousa left the club in the summer of 2009. Harbin would later follow Sousa to Swansea City in July 2009.\n\nAfter seven years in English Football and only three months at Swansea, Harbin decided to return to Australia to take up a senior coaching role at Yeppoon Rugby League club in the Queensland Rugby League Central Division. He was appointed as head coach of the Central Queensland Capras in September 2011. Harbin later became the manager of the Dreamtime Lodge motel in Rockhampton.\n\nIn June 2013, Harbin was appointed as performance manager at English League Two club Plymouth Argyle by manager John Sheridan. He left his position in June 2015 after new manager Derek Adams decided to appoint his own staff. He was appointed as performance coach at League One club Port Vale by manager Rob Page later in the month. He followed Page to league rivals Northampton Town in May 2016. In June 2017, he returned to Oldham Athletic as a fitness and sports psychology coach.\n\nOn 2 January 2019, Harbin was appointed as head coach of National Conference League side Oulton Raiders.\n"}

{"id": "1982813", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982813", "title": "Andreas Kalvos", "text": "Andreas Kalvos\n\nAndreas Kalvos (, also spelled Andreas Calvos; 1 April 1792 – November 3, 1869) was a Greek poet of the Romantic school. He published five volumes of poetry and drama - \"Canzone...\" (1811), \"Le Danaidi\" (1818), (1818), \"Lyra\" (1824) and \"New odes\" (1826). He was a contemporary of the poets Ugo Foscolo and Dionysios Solomos. He was among the representatives of the Heptanese School of literature. No portrait of him is known to exist.\n\nAndreas Calvos was born in April 1792 on the island of Zacynthos (then ruled by the Venetian Republic), the elder of the two sons of Ioannes Calvos and Andriane Calvos (née Roucane). His mother came from an established, landowning family. His younger brother, Nicolaos, was born in 1794. In 1802, when Andreas was ten years old, his father took him and Nicolaos, but not his wife, to Livorno (\"Leghorn\") in Italy, where his brother was consul for the Ionian Islands and where there was a Greek community. The two boys never saw their mother again. In 1805 Calvos's mother obtained a divorce on the grounds of desertion; and shortly afterwards remarried. In Livorno, Andreas first studied ancient Greek and Latin literature and history.\n\nIn Livorno in 1811 he wrote his Italian \"Hymn to Napoleon\", an anti-war poem that he later repudiated (this is how we know of its existence, as the poem itself was not saved). Around the same time he lived for a few months in Pisa, where he worked as a secretary; and then moved to Florence, a centre of intellectual and artistic life of the time.\n\nIn 1812 his father died, and Kalvos's finances became deeply strained. However, during that year he also met Ugo Foscolo, the most honoured Italian poet and scholar of the era, and, like Calvos, a native of Zacynthos. Foscolo gave Calvos a post as his copyist, and put him to teaching a protégé of his. Under the influence of Foscolo Kalvos took up neoclassicism, archaizing ideals, and political liberalism. In 1813 Kalvos wrote three tragedies in Italian: \"Theramenes\", \"Danaïdes\" and \"Hippias\". He also completed four dramatic monologues, in the neoclassical style.\n\nAt the end of 1813, because of his 'advanced' views, Foscolo withdrew to Zurich in Switzerland. Kalvos remained in Florence, where he again became a teacher. In 1814 he wrote another Italian ode, 'To the Ionians', expressing his sympathy with the plight of his fellow-countrymen, and at this period made a close study of the works of Rousseau. He also, it seems, embarked on a love affair with a woman.\n\nIn 1816 Calvos broke off his affair and went to join Foscolo in Switzerland. That year he also learned that his mother had died a year before, a thing that saddened him deeply, as can be seen in his \"Ode to Death\".\n\nBy the end of 1816 the two poets travelled together to Britain, and continued their association in London until February 1817, when for an unknown reason they quarrelled and separated. Foscolo later said that Calvos had exploited him, but it is possible that the younger poet had begun to find Foscolo's patronage irksome. Kalvos earned a living by giving Italian and Greek lessons, and translating the Anglican liturgy into Italian and Greek. In 1818 and 1819 he gave lectures on the pronunciation of ancient Greek. He composed and published a modern Greek grammar, 'Italian Lessons, in four parts' and dealt with the syntax of an English-Greek dictionary.\n\nAfter several love affairs, he married Maria Theresa Thomas, with whom he had one daughter; but his wife died on 17 May 1819 and his daughter shortly afterwards. By the end of 1819 Calvos had a love affair with a student, Susan Fortune Rideout, but her parents did not approve, and it was considered too soon after his wife's death for them to think of marrying. During that time he may have attempted to commit suicide.\n\nAt the beginning of 1820 Calvos left Britain. In September 1820, while returning to Florence, he stopped a short while in Paris.\n\nin Florence he became involved in the movement of the Carbonari, and was arrested and expelled on April 23, 1821. He retreated to Geneva, finding support in the philhellene circle of the city. He worked again as a teacher of foreign languages, while publishing of a manuscript of the Iliad, that however was not successful. Carried away in the enthusiasm of the outbreak of the War of Greek Independence he composed several poems in Greek, and in 1824 published \"Lyra\", a collection of ten Greek odes. Almost immediately the odes were translated into French, and found a favourable reception.\n\nAt the beginning of 1825 Kalvos returned to Paris, where in 1826 he published ten more Greek odes, \"Lyrica\", with the financial aid of philhellenes.\n\nIn the end of July 1826 Calvos decided to travel to Greece himself, and, as he said in the dedication to his 1826 odes, to expose his heart to Musulman fire. He landed at Nauplion; but was soon disappointed by the rivalries and hatreds of the Greeks and their indifference to himself and his work. In August the same year he withdrew to Cercyra (Corfu).\n\nThere he taught in the Ionian Academy (\"Ionios Akademia\") as a private tutor, until he was appointed to the Academy in 1836. He was director of the Corfiot Gymnasium (\"Kerkyraiko Gymnasio\") during 1841, but resigned by the end of the year. He also contributed to local newspapers. For many years he and the poet Dionysios Solomos were both living on Corfu, but the two do not appear to have known each other. This is probably due to his wayward character. The fact he was not recognized in his homeland is perhaps also owed to that. After 1826, Calvos published no more poetry.\n\nIn the end of 1852 Kalvos left Corfu, and returned to Britain. On 5 February 1853 he married Charlotte Augusta Wadams, a woman twenty years younger than he. They settled at Louth, Lincolnshire, where they ran a school for girls.\n\nKalvos died on 3 November 1869 in Louth. His widow died in 1888. They were buried in the graveyard of St Margaret's church, Keddington, near Louth.\n\nIn June 1960 the poet George Seferis, who at that time was Greek ambassador to Britain, arranged for Calvos's remains to be transferred to Zacynthos, where they rest in the church of St Nicolas.\n\n\n\n\n"}

An advising bank's responsibility is to authenticate the letter of credit issued by the issuer to avoid fraud. The advising bank is not necessarily responsible for the payment of the credit which it advises the beneficiary of. The advising bank is usually located in the beneficiary's country. It can be (1) a branch office of the issuing bank or a correspondent bank, or (2) a bank appointed by the beneficiary. An important point is the beneficiary has to be comfortable with the advising bank.\n\nIn case (1), the issuing bank most often sends the L/C through its branch office or correspondent bank to avoid fraud. The branch office or the correspondent bank maintains specimen signature(s) on file where it may counter-check the signature(s) on the L/C, and it has a coding system (a secret test key) to distinguish a genuine L/C from a fraudulent one (authentication).\n\nIn case (2), the beneficiary can request the applicant to specify his/her bank (the beneficiary's bank) as the advising bank in an L/C application. In many countries, this is beneficial to the beneficiary, who may avail themselves of the reduced bank charges and fees because of special relationships with the bank. Under normal circumstances, advising charges are standard and minimal. In addition, it is more convenient to deal with the beneficiary's own bank over a bank with which the beneficiary does not maintain an account.\n"}

Even though she was Punjabi, South Indian audiences embraced her as one of their own. She reciprocated by calling herself \"Tamilian at heart\" and calling Madras her home. She also starred in Telugu and Kannada films and made 32 films in just three years.\n\nShe worked with big banners and top stars in South Indian cinema. She had worked with director K. Balachander once before and had been Kamal Haasan's leading lady in many South Indian films, so she wasn't surprised when they approached her for the Hindi remake of their Telugu film \"Maro Charitra\" (1979). Now re-titled \"Ek Duuje Ke Liye\" (1981), the film was about passionate lovers who are torn apart by their parents in the storytelling tradition of \"Romeo and Juliet\". It became one of the top grossing hits of 1981 and marked the debut into Hindi films of five stars of the South Indian film industry: director K. Balachander, hero Kamal Haasan, heroine Rati Agnihotri, singer S. P. Balasubrahmanyam and supporting actress Madhavi. She then starred in over 43 Hindi films. Her biggest hits were \"Farz Aur Kanoon\" (1982), \"Coolie\" (1983) opposite megastar Amitabh Bachchan, \"Tawaif\" (1985) for which she received her second Filmfare nomination as Best Actress, Aap Ke Saath (1986)\" And Hukumat\" (1987) opposite the Bollywood icon Dharmendra.\n\nLater on, new film offers came in, and she took them, such as \"Yaadein\" (2001) and \"Dev\" (2004).

It was created by Robert D. Cardona and David Mitton.<ref name=\"Sunshine/Pirate\"></ref> who had previously produced the first two series of \"Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends\". Set in the Roaring Twenties, the series focusses on the adventures of two anthropomorphized tugboat fleets, the Star Fleet and the Z-Stacks, who compete against each other in the fictional Bigg City Port: \"\"the biggest harbour in the world\"\".\n\nThe theme tune and incidental music was composed by Junior Campbell and Mike O'Donnell, who also wrote the music for \"Thomas & Friends\" (1984 - 2003).\n\nDespite a second series being planned in advance, when TVS Television lost its franchise to Meridian Broadcasting, the series did not continue production past 13 episodes. Following the initial airing of the series throughout 1989, television rights were sold to an unknown party, while some models and sets from the series were sold to Britt Allcroft. Modified set props and tugboat models were used in \"Thomas & Friends\" from 1991 onwards, with footage from the original program being heavily dubbed and edited for use in the American children's series \"Salty's Lighthouse\".\n\nAfter Clearwater's liquidation in 1990, Mitton joined The Britt Allcroft Company to continue working on \"Thomas & Friends\" in 1991, while Cardona went on to direct \"Theodore Tugboat\", a similarly natured animated series set in Canada. All thirteen episodes of the show were released on VHS between 1988 and 1990.\n\nThe series consists of thirteen fifteen-minute episodes (though four exist as twenty-minute episodes on the \"Tugs\" videos), each told by the show's narrator, Captain Star (voiced by Patrick Allen). Filming and production of the series took place throughout 1987 and 1988, in Shepperton Studios, Middlesex, where \"Thomas & Friends\" was also filmed at the time. The series was animated using live-action models, which were seen as the most realistic method of portraying real tugboats. The set featured the Clearwater Periscope lens system, a type of professional video camera used to film at the models' eye level.\n\nEach model was mounted on a wheeled chassis, which were then pulled through the water using transparent string. Remote control devices were initially tested in operating the machines, but the tugboats became too heavy and unable to move through the water. Remote controls were instead used to power other devices, such as the moving eye features of the models and some cranes.\n\nThroughout the series, the two fleets primarily contest contracts to dock and tow larger sailing vessels and objects, including ocean liners, tramp steamers<ref name=\"High Tide/Warrior/Bigg Freeze\"></ref> and schooners.<ref name=\"Jinxed/Quarantine/Up River\"></ref> Various other contractual obligations were also completed by the two fleets, including transportation of stone, munitions<ref name=\"Munitions/4th of July\"></ref> and logging fell.\n\nThe Star Fleet are the show's protagonists, who aim to work together to achieve contracts in the port. The models were styled upon the Crowley Maritime Corporation, founded in San Francisco in 1892. They are led by Captain Star, who narrates the series. The fleet consists of Ten Cents, Big Mac, O.J., Top Hat, Warrior, Hercules and Sunshine.\n\nAnother tugboat, Boomer, is briefly a member of the Star Fleet after being found floating at sea. Boomer believes himself to be jinxed, and he certainly seems to bring trouble with him wherever he goes. After numerous nasty accidents, Captain Star sells Boomer, who is later made into a houseboat. It is unknown whether he remains part of the fleet after this. The adventures of Boomer are central to the episode \"Jinxed\". Grampus, a naval submarine who appears throughout the series, is purchased from the Navy by Captain Star to work for the Star Fleet. It is also unknown whether this remains after the conclusion of the series.\n\nThe Z-Stacks are the show's antagonists, who are frequently seen trying to sabotage the good work of the Star Fleet. They take on the more risky contracts in the port, at the attraction of a higher pay. The models' design was taken from the Moran Tugs of New York City. They are led by Captain Zero. The fleet consists of Zorran, Zebedee, Zak, Zug and Zip. As with the Star Fleet, Boomer also briefly worked for the Z-Stacks after being sold by the former. Despite this, Boomer was also cast out of the Z-Stacks after his explosives barge spontaneously detonated.\n\n\n\"Tugs\" first aired on Children's ITV in the United Kingdom, and then on Australia's ABC TV. Talks of a second series were never finalised, and eventually all plans to create a follow-up were dropped. Redubbed and heavily edited footage aired later as part of American children's series \"Salty's Lighthouse\", which aired in 1997.\n\nThe series also aired in Japan with Japanese voice-overs.\n\nA number of items of \"Tugs\" merchandise were produced surrounding the series' release in the early 1990s, including:\n\n\nIn line with the series being released in Japan, a range of Japanese merchandise was also released, such as models of the set and characters, videos, books and an LCD game.\n\nThe music for \"Tugs\" was composed by Mike O' Donnell and Junior Campbell on various synthesizers. Pete Zorn played the saxophone in the theme.\n\nA number of VHS versions of the series were released between 1988 and 1993 in the United Kingdom and Japan. All 13 episodes were originally twenty-minutes long, but were edited to fifteen minutes for television broadcasts, most likely due to time slot issues. Three of these videos contained three fifteen-minute episodes, while two contained two twenty-minute episodes. In addition, a number of original scenes were extended/deleted for the videos, including an alternate opening title sequence. Those released included:\n\n\nA four episode, 65 minute version was released in 1993:\n\n\n\"Tugs\" has not yet been released on DVD as a series. In 2005, however, footage from the show was included as part of an episode of \"Salty's Lighthouse\" on the DVD \"Toddler Time\".\n\nIn 2012, having long been presumed destroyed, the original models from the series were located and purchased by a group of fans via eBay UK. In early 2013, they established 'The Star Tugs Company Ltd' (\"now renamed TUGS - The Exhibition\") - a dedicated non-for-profit group aiming to preserve, restore and display the various models and props used in the production. The exhibition now owns the majority of the major and supporting cast (with the exception of Top Hat, Grampus and The Coast Guard, the whereabouts of which are unknown), several alternate faces for the characters, various props and other related assets to the series.\n\nThe exhibition is held in a railway coach, situated at Butterley station at the Midland Railway - Butterley in Derbyshire, England and is open to the public everyday when the railway runs timetabled services and at special 'TUGS' weekends.\n\n\n"}

He served in the Delaware General Assembly, as a Continental Congressman from Delaware, and as President of Delaware.\n\nVan Dyke was born at \"Berwick,\" his family's home in St. George's Hundred, New Castle County, Delaware, near the present location of Delaware City. He was the son of Nicholas and Rachael Alee Van Dyke, whose father, Andrew Van Dyke, had moved there from Long Island in New York in 1704. Young Nicholas was educated at home, then read law in Philadelphia where he was admitted to the Pennsylvania Bar in 1765.\n\nVan Dyke returned to New Castle where he lived with his family and began a law practice. He married twice, first in 1766 to Elizabeth Nixon who died bearing their first child, Rachael, in 1767. After her death he married Charlotte Stanley. They made their home in New Castle and had four children, Nancy Ann, Mary, Nicholas, and Henry. They were members of Immanuel Episcopal Church.\n\nVan Dyke entered political life in 1774 as a member of the Boston Relief Committee in Delaware. He then was a member of the Delaware Constitutional Convention of 1776 and served in the State Council for two years beginning with the 1776/77 session. That same year he was appointed as Judge of Delaware's Admiralty Court, and on February 22, 1777 he was elected to the Continental Congress to replace John Evans who had declined to serve. He would remain in Congress through 1781 and signed the Articles of Confederation for Delaware. For five sessions, from 1778/79 until he became President of Delaware in 1783, he served in the State House and was the Speaker in the 1780/81 session.\n\nA few months after John Dickinson resigned as President of Delaware in 1782, the Delaware General Assembly held a special vote to choose a successor to the conservative President John Cook. The conservative faction tried to elect John McKinly, who had been the first President, but the patriot faction won by electing Van Dyke. He took office February 1, 1783 and served until October 27, 1786.\n\nIt was during his tenure as President of Delaware that the American Revolution officially ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris in September 1783. In an attempt to solve one problem resulting from the war, Van Dyke proposed and carried out a plan to pay Delaware's portion of the war debt. Another difficult unresolved war problem was the fate of loyalist Cheney Clow. Arrested in 1778, tried for and acquitted of treason in 1782, he was then charged with the murder of a member of the posse sent to capture him in 1778. Though there was no evidence that Clow actually killed the man, in May 1783 a jury convicted him and sentenced him to death. Unable politically to pardon Clow, but aware that many responsible people, including Caesar Rodney's brother, Thomas Rodney, believed the man innocent, Van Dyke postponed the execution indefinitely.\n\nVan Dyke returned to the State Senate for single session tenures in 1786/87 and briefly until his death in the 1788/89 session, when he was the Speaker.\n\nVan Dyke died at \"Berwick\", in St. George's Hundred, New Castle County, and was buried there at first. Later his remains were removed to the Immanuel Episcopal Church Cemetery at New Castle.\n\nHis son, also Nicholas, would later represent Delaware in the U.S. House and U.S. Senate. His daughter, Nancy Ann, married Kensey Johns at a 1784 wedding in the Amstel House in New Castle that was attended by General George Washington. Their son, Kensey Johns Jr., would later serve in the U.S. House.\n\nMuch of the property surrounding Van Dyke's original home \"Berwick\" was taken in 1829 for the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal, but the house itself remained through the American Civil War. All the remaining lands and home are believed to have been taken when the canal was expanded in 1929. His New Castle home, now known as the Amstel House, still stands on Fourth Street in New Castle and is open to the public.\n\nNo known portrait of Nicholas Van Dyke exists.\n\nElections were held October 1 and members of the General Assembly took office on October 20 or the following weekday. State Legislative Councilmen had a three-year term and State Assemblymen had a one-year term. The whole General Assembly chose the Continental Congressmen for a one-year term and it chose the State President for a three-year term. \n\n\n"}

It lies on the Vistula River in the vicinity of Włocławek. the town had a population of 2,400.\n\nSettlement in the Dobrzyń Land is dated as far back as 1065 when the first mention of Dobrzyń (as Dobrin) comes from 1065.\n\nIn the 11th century there was a castellan stronghold here. From 1228, Konrad Mazowiecki allowed the military knights called the Dobrzyń brothers. The crusading Order of Dobrzyń was granted Dobrzyń as a base in 1228, although the knights were later incorporated into the Teutonic Order.\n\nThe 13th and 14th century was tumultuous time for the city. Despite, the town being accorded city rights by the beginning of the 13th century, and being the capital of a principality until the beginning of the 14th century it bore the brunt of the conflicts between the state of Poland and the Teutonic Knights to the north. \nA castle was constructed by the Order of Dobrzyń. In 1235, the castle returned to the Mazovian dukes. In 1329, it was taken by the Teutonic Knights, who returned it to Kazimier the Great after signing the Kalisz peace in 1343. However, the Castle was destroyed in 1409. It was also sacked by Daniel of Galicia, who was King of Galicia in 1240.\n\nA city was founded here before 1230 probably based on the Lubeck law. In 1230 document records that Wojciech was village leader from an unspecified town, identified in the literature with Dobrzyń.\n\nIn 1239, the village administrator of Dobrzyń called Konrad is recorded.\nA village governor of Dobrzyn called Gocwin, is recorded with the erroneous date of 1296 (the correct year is 1306).\n\nSome time before 1319, the governance of the village changed from an appointed administrator to a town council. In 1322, the head of the village Council, called Lemko, was mentioned.\n\nThe letter of the bishop of Varmia claims that in 1323, Lithuanians attacked the dutchy of Dobrzyn and \"Captured the city of Dobrzyn, destroying it by fire to its foundations; in it they killed two thousand people, while in the land itself of Dobrzyn — six thousand people of both sexes, also seven priests and forty other clerics whom... oh sorrow! they led away to perpetual slavery. Also they slew two monks of the order of St. Benedict, and burned ten parish churches, not counting chapels...\" \n\nThe date of the attack is presumed to be on September 14, 1323. Chronicler Peter of Dusburg gives a figure up to 2000 people died in the sack. It took a long time for the town to recover from the attack, although the city retained its municipal rights. it was no longer a Duchy.\n\nDuring the raid of the Teutonic Order, the stronghold in Dobrzyń was attacked again in March 1329, when the towns mayor was killed by a catapult stone. In March 1329, after the siege, the Teutonic Knights occupied the castle in Dobrzyń.\nAfter the peace of Kalisz between Kazimier the Great and the Teutonic Knights, Dobrzyń returned to Poland.\n\nFrom the end of the 13th and at the beginning of the 14th century (1288-1327 and 1343-1352) The town was the seat of the dukes of Dobrzyn.\nFrom 1380 the town was a fief of Władysław Opolczyk, who in 1392 gave in pledge to the Teutonic Knights. Thanks to the purchase of the pledge in 1404, the town returned to the kingdom of Poland. \nThe Castle was besieged and burnt by the Teutonic Knights on August 18, 1409.\nThe Dukes of Dobrzyń ruled the town again from 1379–1391.\n\nWładysław Jagiełło gave the rights to Dobrzyń to pledge to the Teutonic Knights, causing a legal conflict between Poland and the Teutonic Order which only ended on June 10, 1405, when Dobrzyń was bought by Poland.\n\nBut Dobrzyń was on August 20, 1409, captured by the Teutonic Knights again this time using artillery. The town was burned.\n\nDobrzyń was returned to Poland at the First Peace of Toruń in 1411. The town became the seat of a judicial court at this time.\nDobrzynia fell to the Swedish Deluge, when the city was looted and burned. \nAround 1388, a Franciscan monastery was founded in the city. In 1390, Władysław Opolczyk gave them some ground, and in 1395 Wojciech from Chełmica Mała of the Nałęcz family with his family gave monks 60 monies for the construction of a monastery church.\n\nThe semi legendary Nawojka is said to have been born here in the early 1400s, the daughter of the mayor.\n\nA Jewish community was established in the town in about 1765, and Jews at one time made up one-third of the total population, but most left for Britain and the United States in the years around 1900, with none remaining today.\n\nIn 1807, Dobrzyń was incorporated into the Duchy of Warsaw.\n\nDuring World War 2 the Germans changed the name of the city to Dobrin an der Weichsel (1939-1945).\n\nCurrently, it is a local commercial and service center with few industrial plants (footwear factory, fishing cooperative, slaughterhouse, mill). On January 1, 2018, Dobrzyń on the Vistula River had a population of 2,161.\n\n\n\n<br>\n"}
{"id": "1982853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982853", "title": "Shear zone", "text": "Shear zone\n\nA shear zone is a very important structural discontinuity surface in the Earth's crust and upper mantle. It forms as a response to inhomogeneous deformation partitioning strain into planar or curviplanar high-strain zones. Intervening (crustal) blocks stay relatively unaffected by the deformation. Due to the shearing motion of the surrounding more rigid medium, a rotational, non co-axial component can be induced in the shear zone. Because the discontinuity surface usually passes through a wide depth-range, a great variety of different rock types with their characteristic structures are produced.\n\nA shear zone is a zone of strong deformation (with a high strain rate) surrounded by rocks with a lower state of finite strain. It is characterised by a length to width ratio of more than 5:1.\n\nShear zones form a continuum of geological structures, ranging from \"brittle shear zones\" (or faults) via \"brittle–ductile shear zones\" (or \"semibrittle shear zones\"), \"ductile–brittle\" to \"ductile shear zones\". In brittle shear zones, the deformation is concentrated in a narrow fracture surface separating the wall rocks, whereas in a ductile shear zone the deformation is spread out through a wider zone, the deformation state varying continuously from wall to wall. Between these end-members, there are intermediate types of brittle–ductile (semibrittle) and ductile–brittle shear zones that can combine these geometric features in different proportions.\n\nThis continuum found in the structural geometries of shear zones reflects the different deformation mechanisms reigning in the crust, i.e. the changeover from brittle (fracturing) at or near the surface to ductile (flow) deformation with increasing depth. By passing through the \"brittle–semibrittle transition\" the ductile response to deformation is starting to set in. This transition is not tied to a specific depth, but rather occurs over a certain depth range - the so-called alternating zone, where brittle fracturing and plastic flow coexist. The main reason for this is found in the usually heteromineral composition of rocks, with different minerals showing different responses to applied stresses (for instance, under stress quartz reacts plastically long before feldspars do). Thus differences in lithology, grain size, and preexisting fabrics determine a different rheological response. Yet other, purely physical factors, influence the changeover depth as well, including:\n\nIn Scholz's model for a quartzo-feldspathic crust (with a geotherm taken from Southern California), the brittle–semibrittle transition starts at about 11 km depth with an ambient temperature of 300 °C. The underlying alternating zone then extends to roughly 16 km depth with a temperature of about 360 °C. Below approximately 16 km depth, only ductile shear zones are found.\n\nThe \"seismogenic zone\", in which earthquakes nucleate, is tied to the brittle domain, the schizosphere. Below an intervening alternating zone, there is the plastosphere. In the seismogenic layer, which occurs below an \"upper stability transition\" related to an upper seismicity cutoff (situated usually at about 4–5 km depth), true cataclasites start to appear. The seismogenic layer then yields to the alternating zone at 11 km depth. Yet big earthquakes can rupture both up to the surface and well into the alternating zone, sometimes even into the plastosphere.\n\nThe deformations in shear zones are responsible for the development of characteristic fabrics and mineral assemblages reflecting the reigning pressure–temperature (pT) conditions, flow type, movement sense, and deformation history. Shear zones are therefore very important structures for unravelling the history of a specific terrane.\n\nStarting at the Earth's surface, the following rock types are usually encountered in a shear zone:\nBoth fault gouge and cataclasites are due to abrasive wear on brittle, seismogenic faults.\nMylonites start to occur with the onset of semibrittle behaviour in the alternating zone characterised by adhesive wear. Pseudotachylites can still be encountered here. By passing into greenschist facies conditions, the pseudotachylites disappear and only different types of mylonites persist. Striped gneisses are high-grade mylonites and occur at the very bottom of ductile shear zones.\n\nThe sense of shear in a shear zone (dextral, sinistral, reverse or normal) can be deduced by macroscopic structures and by a plethora of microtectonic indicators.\n\nThe main macroscopic indicators are striations (slickensides), slickenfibers, and stretching– or mineral lineations. They indicate the direction of movement. With the aid of offset markers such as displaced layering and dykes, or the deflection (bending) of layering/foliation into a shear zone, one can additionally determine the sense of shear.\n\n\"En echelon\" tension gash arrays (or extensional veins), characteristic of ductile-brittle shear zones, and sheath folds can also be valuable macroscopic shear-sense indicators.\n\nMicroscopic indicators consist of the following structures:\n\nThe width of individual shear zones stretches from the grain scale to the kilometer scale. Crustal-scale shear zones (megashears) can become 10 km wide and consequently show very large displacements from tens to hundreds of kilometers.\n\nBrittle shear zones (faults) usually widen with depth and with an increase in displacements.\n\nBecause shear zones are characterised by the localisation of strain, some form of \"strain softening\" must occur, in order for the affected host material to deform more plastically. The softening can be brought about by the following phenomena:\n\nFurthermore, for a material to become more ductile (quasi-plastic) and undergo continuous deformation (flow) without fracturing, the following deformation mechanisms (on a grain scale) have to be taken into account:\n\nDue to their deep penetration, shear zones are found in all metamorphic facies. Brittle shear zones are more or less ubiquitous in the upper crust. Ductile shear zones start at greenschist facies conditions and are therefore restricted to metamorphic terranes.\n\nShear zones can occur in the following geotectonic settings:\n\nShear zones are dependent neither on rock type nor on geological age. Most often they are not isolated in their occurrence, but commonly form fractal-scaled, linked up, \"anastomosing networks\" which reflect in their arrangement the underlying dominant sense of movement of the terrane at that time.\n\nSome good examples of shear zones of the strike-slip type are the South Armorican Shear Zone and the North Armorican Shear Zone in Brittany, the North Anatolian Fault Zone in Turkey, and the Dead Sea Fault in Israel. Shear zones of the transform type are the San Andreas Fault in California, and the Alpine Fault in New Zealand. A shear zone of the thrust type is the Moine Thrust in northwestern Scotland. An example for the subduction zone setting is the Japan Median Tectonic Line. Detachment fault related shear zones can be found in southeastern California, e.g. the Whipple Mountain Detachment Fault. An example of a huge anastomosing shear-zone is the Borborema Shear Zone in Brazil.\n\nThe importance of shear zones lies in the fact that they are major zones of weakness in the Earth's crust, sometimes extending into the upper mantle. They can be very long-lived features and commonly show evidence of several overprinting stages of activity. Material can be transported upwards or downwards in them, the most important one being water circulating dissolved ions. This can bring about metasomatism in the host rocks and even re-fertilise mantle material.\n\nShear zones can host economically viable mineralizations, examples being important gold deposits in Precambrian terranes.\n\n"}
{"id": "1982854", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982854", "title": "Push technology", "text": "Push technology\n\nPush notifications are small messages that can reach audiences anywhere and anytime. While pop-ups appear only when audiences are on the site they belong to, push messages are independent of sites. They are associated with web browsers and apps. \n\nPush technology, or server push, is a style of Internet-based communication where the request for a given transaction is initiated by the publisher or central server. It is contrasted with pull/get, where the request for the transmission of information is initiated by the receiver or client.\n\nPush services are often based on information preferences expressed in advance. This is called a publish/subscribe model. A client \"subscribes\" to various information \"channels\" provided by a server; whenever new content is available on one of those channels, the server pushes that information out to the client.\n\nPush is sometimes emulated with a polling technique, particularly under circumstances where a real push is not possible, such as sites with security policies that require rejection of incoming HTTP/S requests.\n\nSynchronous conferencing and instant messaging are typical examples of push services. Chat messages and sometimes files are pushed to the user as soon as they are received by the messaging service. Both decentralised peer-to-peer programs (such as WASTE) and centralised programs (such as IRC or XMPP) allow pushing files, which means the sender initiates the data transfer rather than the recipient.\n\nEmail may also be a push system: SMTP is a push protocol (see Push e-mail). However, the last step—from mail server to desktop computer—typically uses a pull protocol like POP3 or IMAP. Modern e-mail clients make this step seem instantaneous by repeatedly polling the mail server, frequently checking it for new mail. The IMAP protocol includes the IDLE command, which allows the server to tell the client when new messages arrive. The original BlackBerry was the first popular example of push-email in a wireless context.\n\nAnother example is the PointCast Network, which was widely covered in the 1990s. It delivered news and stock market data as a screensaver. Both Netscape and Microsoft integrated push technology through the Channel Definition Format (CDF) into their software at the height of the browser wars, but it was never very popular. CDF faded away and was removed from the browsers of the time, replaced in the 2000s with RSS (a pull system.)\n\nOther uses of push-enabled web applications include software updates distribution (\"push updates\"), market data distribution (stock tickers), online chat/messaging systems (webchat), auctions, online betting and gaming, sport results, monitoring consoles, and sensor network monitoring.\n\nThe Webpush proposal of the Internet Engineering Task Force is a simple protocol using HTTP version 2 to deliver realtime events, such as incoming calls or messages, which can be delivered (or “pushed”) in a timely fashion. The protocol consolidates all real-time events into a single session which ensures more efficient use of network and radio resources. A single service consolidates all events, distributing those events to applications as they arrive. This requires just one session, avoiding duplicated overhead costs.\n\nWeb Notifications are part of W3C standard and defines an API for end-user notifications. A notification allows alerting the user outside the context of a web page of an occurrence, such as the delivery of email. As part of this standard Push API defined by W3C, is now being implemented by Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari.\n\nHTTP server push (also known as HTTP streaming) is a mechanism for sending unsolicited (asynchronous) data from a web server to a web browser. HTTP server push can be achieved through any of several mechanisms.\n\nAs a part of HTML5 the WebSocket API allows a web server and client to communicate over a full-duplex TCP connection.\n\nGenerally the web server does not terminate a connection after response data has been served to a client. The web server leaves the connection open so that if an event occurs (for example, a change in internal data which needs to be reported to one or multiple clients), it can be sent out immediately; otherwise, the event would have to be queued until the client's next request is received. Most web servers offer this functionality via CGI (e.g., Non-Parsed Headers scripts on Apache HTTP Server). The underlying mechanism for this approach is chunked transfer encoding.\n\nAnother mechanism is related to a special MIME type called codice_1, which was introduced by Netscape in 1995. Web browsers interpret this as a document that changes whenever the server pushes a new version to the client. It is still supported by Firefox, Opera, and Safari today, but it is ignored by Internet Explorer and is only partially supported by Google Chrome. It can be applied to HTML documents, and also for streaming images in webcam applications.\n\nThe WHATWG Web Applications 1.0 proposal includes a mechanism to push content to the client. On September 1, 2006, the Opera web browser implemented this new experimental system in a feature called \"Server-Sent Events\". It is now being standardized as part of HTML5.\n\nIn this technique, the server takes advantage of persistent HTTP connections, leaving the response perpetually \"open\" (i.e., the server never terminates the response), effectively fooling the browser to remain in \"loading\" mode after the initial page load could be considered complete. The server then periodically sends snippets of JavaScript to update the content of the page, thereby achieving push capability. By using this technique, the client doesn't need Java applets or other plug-ins in order to keep an open connection to the server; the client is automatically notified about new events, pushed by the server. One serious drawback to this method, however, is the lack of control the server has over the browser timing out; a page refresh is always necessary if a timeout occurs on the browser end.\n\nLong polling is itself not a true push; long polling is a variation of the traditional polling technique, but it allows emulating a push mechanism under circumstances where a real push is not possible, such as sites with security policies that require rejection of incoming HTTP/S Requests.\n\nWith long polling, the client requests information from the server exactly as in normal polling, but with the expectation the server may not respond immediately. If the server has no new information for the client when the poll is received, instead of sending an empty response, the server holds the request open and waits for response information to become available. Once it does have new information, the server immediately sends an HTTP/S response to the client, completing the open HTTP/S Request. Upon receipt of the server response, the client often immediately issues another server request. In this way the usual response latency (the time between when the information first becomes available at the next client request) otherwise associated with polling clients is eliminated.\n\nFor example, BOSH is a popular, long-lived HTTP technique used as a long-polling alternative to a continuous TCP connection when such a connection is difficult or impossible to employ directly (e.g., in a web browser); it is also an underlying technology in the XMPP, which Apple uses for its iCloud push support.\n\nThis technique, used by Cbox and other chat applications, makes use of the XMLSocket object in a single-pixel Adobe Flash movie. Under the control of JavaScript, the client establishes a TCP connection to a unidirectional relay on the server. The relay server does not read anything from this socket; instead it immediately sends the client a unique identifier. Next, the client makes an HTTP request to the web server, including with it this identifier. The web application can then push messages addressed to the client to a local interface of the relay server, which relays them over the Flash socket. The advantage of this approach is that it appreciates the natural read-write asymmetry that is typical of many web applications, including chat, and as a consequence it offers high efficiency. Since it does not accept data on outgoing sockets, the relay server does not need to poll outgoing TCP connections \"at all\", making it possible to hold open tens of thousands of concurrent connections. In this model, the limit to scale is the TCP stack of the underlying server operating system.\n\nIn services such as Cloud Computing, to increase reliability and availability of data, it is usually pushed (replicated) to several machines. For example, the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) makes 2 extra copies of any object stored. RGDD focuses on efficiently casting an object from one location to many while saving bandwidth by sending minimal number of copies (only one in the best case) of the object over any link across the network. For example, Datacast is a scheme for delivery to many nodes inside datacenters that relies on regular and structured topologies and DCCast is a similar approach for delivery across datacenters.\n\nA push notification is a message that is \"pushed\" from backend server or application to user interface, e.g. (but not limited to) mobile applications and desktop applications. Push notifications were first introduced by Apple in 2009.\nIn 2010 Google released its own service, Google Cloud to Device Messaging. (It has since been replaced by Google Cloud Messaging and then Firebase Cloud Messaging.)\nNovember 2015, Microsoft announced that the Windows Notification Service would be expanded to make use of the Universal Windows Platform architecture, allowing for push data to be sent to Windows 10, Windows 10 Mobile, Xbox, as well as other supported platforms using universal API calls and POST requests.\n\nPush notifications are mainly divided into 2 approaches, local notifications and remote notifications. For local notifications, the application schedules the notification with the local device's OS, or, alternatively, sets as a timer in the application itself if it is able to continuously run in the background. When the event's scheduled time is reached, or the event's programmed condition is met, the message is displayed in the application's user interface.\n\nRemote notifications are handled by a remote server. Under this scenario, the client application needs to be registered on the server with a unique key (e.g., a UUID). The server then fires the message against the unique key to deliver the message to the client application via an agreed client/server protocol such as HTTP or XMPP and the client displays the message received. When the push notification arrives, it can transmit short notifications and messages, set badges on application icons, blink or continuously light up the notification LED, or play alert sounds to attract user's attention. Push notifications are usually used by applications to bring information to users' attention. The content of the messages can be classified in the following example categories:\n\nReal-time push notifications may raise privacy issues since they can be used to bind virtual identities of social network pseudonyms to the real identities of the smartphone owners.\n\n\n"}

He was a member of the Federalist Party, who served in the Delaware General Assembly, as Attorney General of Delaware, as U.S. Representative from Delaware, and as U.S. senator from Delaware.\n\nVan Dyke was born in New Castle, Delaware, son of Nicholas and Charlotte Stanley Van Dyke. His father had been a member of the Continental Congress and a President of Delaware. The younger Nicholas graduated from the College of New Jersey, now Princeton University in 1788, studied law with his brother-in-law, Kensy Johns, and was admitted to the Delaware Bar in New Castle, in 1792. He married Mary Ann Leuvaneigh in 1792. They had six children, including Nicholas III, Kensey Johns, and Dorcas Montgomery and lived at many houses in and around New Castle. One of these was at the corner of Delaware and Fourth Streets and was the location of the 1824 wedding of Dorcas Van Dyke and Charles I. du Pont, which was attended by the Marquis de Lafayette. His farm and summer retreat, The Hermitage, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The family were members of Immanuel Episcopal Church.\n\nVan Dyke was a Federalist who was a member of the Delaware House of Representatives in 1799. From 1801 until 1806 he served as Delaware Attorney General. In 1807 he was elected to the 10th United States Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of U.S. Representative James M. Broom. He was reelected to the 11th Congress, and served in the U.S. House from October 6, 1807, until March 3, 1811. With the Federalists a powerless minority in Congress, he returned home to serve as the Attorney General of Delaware. Subsequently, he was elected to the Delaware State Senate for the 1816 and 1817 sessions. While serving there he was elected to the United States Senate and served from March 4, 1817, until his death on May 21, 1826. He missed the first month and a half of the 18th Congress, as his first term in the Senate expired on March 3, 1823, and he was not re-elected by the Delaware Legislature until January 7, 1824. He did not take his seat in the Senate for the 18th Congress until January 14, 1824, while the Senate had convened on December 1, 1823. He was Chairman of the Committee on Pensions in the 16th U.S. Congress.\n\nVan Dyke died at New Castle, and is buried there in the Immanuel Episcopal Church Cemetery. A fellow lawyer who knew Van Dyke compared him to other layers by saying that he was a \"sound lawyer and superior to them all as a fluent, graceful and successful advocate and in the skillful management of his cases.\" \n\nElections were held the first Tuesday of October and members of the General Assembly took office on the first Tuesday of January. The State Senate had a term of three years and the State House had a term of one year. U.S. Representatives took office March 4 and had a two-year term. The General Assembly chose the U.S. senators who also took office March 4, but for a six-year term.\n\n\n\n"}

The present bridge is a 1926 rebuilding and widening (re-using the original masonry) of John Gwynn's design, completed in 1774. A bridge is known to have stood at this spot since at least Norman times. Historically, it was known as the \"Stone Bridge\". It is a Grade II* listed building.\n\nThe original Norman bridge consisted of five arches and a timber causeway. A large tower stood on the East bank, housing a gate and a drawbridge. The bridge also supported several shops and houses. Building work on Gwynn's replacement bridge started on 29 June 1769, and comprised seven semicircular arches, long. This bridge cost £16,000. The span central arch was built high, to provide headroom to watercraft, but this resulted in steep approaches.\n\nAs a result, a new design was put forward in 1921 by Arthur W. Ward, the Borough Surveyor. This lowered all the arches, converting the central one into a segmental arch, reducing the height of the roadway by . The new bridge was to be wide, more than twice as wide as Gwynn's structure (of 23 and a half feet width). It cost £86,000 and was formally opened on 26 October 1927 by Queen Mary, although it had been completed the previous year. Ward's bridge reused the old masonry, each stone carefully numbered, as well as a quantity of new stonework. Concrete was used to 'saddle' the arches and in the foundations.\n\nThe bridge is one of two bridges carrying the main east-west route over the Severn as it loops around Shrewsbury; the Welsh Bridge is its counterpart on the other side of the town. Despite the names, both bridges are in England, but the Welsh Bridge is on the side closer to Wales.\n\nThomas Telford's Holyhead Road, dating from 1815 and connecting London to the main sea-crossing to Ireland, used the English Bridge to cross the Severn here. The road's modern successor, the A5, now bypasses Shrewsbury and the bridge's main role today is to connect the centre of Shrewsbury with the Belle Vue and Abbey Foregate areas of the town.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1982872", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982872", "title": "Five color theorem", "text": "Five color theorem\n\nThe five color theorem is a result from graph theory that given a plane separated into regions, such as a political map of the counties of a state, the regions may be colored using no more than five colors in such a way that no two adjacent regions receive the same color.\n\nThe five color theorem is implied by the stronger four color theorem, but is considerably easier to prove. It was based on a failed attempt at the four color proof by Alfred Kempe in 1879. Percy John Heawood found an error 11 years later, and proved the five color theorem based on Kempe's work.\n\nFirst of all, one associates a simple planar graph formula_1 to the given map, namely one puts a vertex in each region of the map, then connects two vertices with an edge if and only if the corresponding regions share a common border. The problem is then translated into a graph coloring problem: one has to paint the vertices of the graph so that no edge has endpoints of the same color.\n\nBecause formula_1 is a simple planar, i.e. it may be embedded in the plane without intersecting edges, and it does not have two vertices sharing more than one edge, and it doesn't have loops, then it can be shown (using the Euler characteristic of the plane) that it must have a vertex shared by at most five edges. (Note: This is the only place where the five-color condition is used in the proof. If this technique is used to prove the four-color theorem, it will fail on this step. In fact, an icosahedral graph is 5-regular and planar, and thus does not have a vertex shared by at most four edges.) Find such a vertex, and call it formula_3.\n\nNow remove formula_3 from formula_1. The graph formula_6 obtained this way has one fewer vertex than formula_1, so we can assume by induction that it can be colored with only five colors. formula_3 must be connected to five other vertices, since if not it can be colored in formula_1 with a color not used by them. So now look at those five vertices formula_10, formula_11, formula_12, formula_13, formula_14 that were adjacent to formula_3 in cyclic order (which depends on how we write G). If we did not use all the five colors on them, then obviously we can paint formula_3 in a consistent way to render our graph 5-colored.\n\nSo we can assume that formula_10, formula_11, formula_12, formula_13, formula_14 are colored with colors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively.\n\nNow consider the subgraph formula_22 of formula_6 consisting of the vertices that are colored with colors 1 and 3 only and the edges connecting them. To be clear, each edge connects a color 1 vertex to a color 3 vertex (this is called a Kempe chain). If formula_10 and formula_12 lie in different connected components of formula_22, we can swap the 1 and 3 colors on the component containing formula_10, thus freeing color 1 for formula_3 and completing the task.\n\nIf on the contrary formula_10 and formula_12 lie in the same connected component of formula_22, we can find a path in formula_22 joining them that consists of only color 1 and 3 vertices.\n\nNow turn to the subgraph formula_33 of formula_6 consisting of the vertices that are colored with colors 2 and 4 only and the edges connecting them, and apply the same arguments as before. Then either we are able to reverse the 2-4 coloration on the subgraph of formula_33 containing formula_11 and paint formula_3 color 2, or we can connect formula_11 and formula_13 with a path that consists of only color 2 and 4 vertices. The latter possibility is clearly absurd, as such a path would intersect the 1-3 colored path we constructed before.\n\nSo formula_1 can in fact be five-colored, contrary to the initial presumption.\n\nIn 1996, Robertson, Sanders, Seymour, and Thomas described a quadratic four-coloring algorithm in their \"Efficiently four-coloring planar graphs\". In the same paper they briefly describe a linear-time five-coloring algorithm, which is asymptotically optimal. The algorithm as described here operates on multigraphs and relies on the ability to have multiple copies of edges between a single pair of vertices. It is based on Wernicke's theorem, which states the following:\n\nWe will use a representation of the graph in which each vertex maintains a circular linked list of adjacent vertices, in clockwise planar order.\n\nIn concept, the algorithm is recursive, reducing the graph to a smaller graph with one less vertex, five-coloring that graph, and then using that coloring to determine a coloring for the larger graph in constant time. In practice, rather than maintain an explicit graph representation for each reduced graph, we will remove vertices from the graph as we go, adding them to a stack, then color them as we pop them back off the stack at the end. We will maintain three stacks:\n\n\nThe algorithm works as follows:\n\n\n"}

He did not play the game as a child – atypical for a successful professional golfer – in high school he focused on basketball and baseball. Nelson took up golf at the age of 21, after he returned from serving in the infantry in Vietnam (Nelson was a 20-year-old newlywed when he was drafted into the U.S. Army). Nelson was first introduced to golf by Ken Hummel, a soldier and friend in his infantry unit, and Nelson carefully studied Ben Hogan's book \"The Five Fundamentals of Golf\" while learning how to play the game. He soon discovered that he had a talent for the game, breaking 100 the first time he played and 70 within nine months. Nelson went on to graduate from Kennesaw Junior College in 1970 and turned professional the following year. He qualified for the PGA Tour at 27. Nelson's breakthrough year came in 1979, when he won twice and finished second on the money list to Tom Watson.\n\nNelson won 10 times on the PGA Tour, including three major championships. He earned his first major title at the 1981 PGA Championship, which he won by four strokes. In 1983, Nelson was victorious at the U.S. Open at Oakmont, coming from seven behind at the half-way point to defeat Tom Watson by a single shot. Nelson scored a U.S. Open record 65-67 over the last 36 holes at the difficult Oakmont course, which broke a 51-year Open record established by Gene Sarazen. His 10-under-par 132 record score has yet to be equaled. In 1987, he finished tied with Lanny Wadkins after the regulation 72 holes of PGA Championship, and won the title with a par at the first playoff hole.\n\nNelson played on the U.S. Ryder Cup team in 1979, 1981, and 1987. His record of 9–3–1 is one of the best since the event became USA v Europe in 1979; it had been a perfect 9–0–0 after the first two events.\n\nNelson also had great success internationally. He won four tournaments on the Japan Golf Tour. Only Tom Watson has won as many events in Japan for an American golfer who never played in Japan full-time. Nelson also finished runner-up at the 1982 Dunlop Phoenix Tournament and the 1987 Mitsui Sumitomo Visa Taiheiyo Masters. Although he never won on the Australasian Tour he finished runner-up at the 1987 New Zealand Open, losing to Northern Ireland's Ronan Rafferty in a playoff.\n\nSince turning 50 in 1997, Nelson has had a successful Champions Tour career, winning 19 times, although he has not won a senior major. He was elected to the World Golf Hall of Fame in April 2006 and inducted in October 2006. In 2011, Nelson received the PGA Distinguished Service Award from\nthe PGA of America. The award \"honors outstanding individuals who display leadership and humanitarian qualities, including integrity, sportsmanship and enthusiasm for the game of golf\".\n\nNelson is also active in golf course design and created the LagRx Swing Trainer to help golfers condition and improve their muscle memory.\n\nPGA Tour playoff record (3–2)\n\n\nChampions Tour playoff record (2–3)\n\nPGA Tour of Australasia playoff record (0–1)\n\nDefeated Wadkins with a par on the first extra hole.\n\nCUT = missed the halfway cut (3rd round cut in 1984 Open Championship)\nDQ = disqualified\nWD = withdrew\n\"T\" indicates a tie for a place.\n\n\nCUT = missed the halfway cut\nDQ = disqualified\n\"T\" indicates a tie for a place\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1982912", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982912", "title": "Coulomb stress transfer", "text": "Coulomb stress transfer\n\nCoulomb stress transfer is a seismic-related geological process of stress changes to surrounding material caused by local discrete deformation events. Using mapped displacements of the Earth's surface during earthquakes, computed Coulomb stress changes have suggested that stress relieved during an earthquake does not only dissipate, but can also move up and down fault segments, concentrating and promoting subsequent tremors. Importantly, Coulomb stress changes have been applied to earthquake-forecasting models that have been used to assess potential hazards related to earthquake activity.\n\nThe Coulomb failure criterion requires that the Coulomb stress exceeds a value σ defined by the shear stress τ, normal stress σ, pore pressure p, and coefficient of friction μ of a failure plane, such that\n\nIt is also often assumed that changes in pore fluid pressure induced by changes in stress are proportional to the normal stress change across the fault plane. These effects are incorporated into an effective coefficient of friction μ’, such that\n\nThis simplification allows for the calculation of Coulomb stress changes on a fault plane to be independent of the regional stress field but instead depends on the fault geometry, sense of slip, and coefficient of friction.\n\nThe significance of the Coulomb stress changes was discovered when mapped displacements of neighbouring fault movements were used to calculate Coulomb stress changes along faults. Results revealed that the stress relieved on faults during earthquakes did not simply dissipate, but also moved up and down fault segments. Moreover, mapped lobes of increased and decreased Coulomb stress around local faults exhibited increased and decreased rates of seismicity respectively shortly after neighboring earthquakes, but eventually return to their background rate over time.\n\nStress triggering describes the responsive rupturing of faults from increases in Coulomb stress caused by exogenous deformation events. Although neighboring displacements often yield small magnitude stress changes, areas of disturbed Coulomb stress states have been successfully used to explain the spatial distribution of stress triggered aftershock seismicity.\n\nOn June 28, 1992, a M7.3 earthquake that struck near Landers, California was followed (about three hours later) by the M6.5 Big Bear foreshock earthquake 40 km away. Calculated Coulomb stress changes from both of these earthquakes showed a westward lobe of 2.1–2.9 bars of increased Coulomb stress to have resulted from the displacement associated with both earthquakes. Of the roughly 20,000 aftershocks that occurred 25 days after June 28 within a 5 km radius, more than 75% occurred in areas where Coulomb stress had increased and less than 25% occurred in areas where Coulomb stress had dropped.\n\nAnother successful case study of earthquake prediction occurred along Turkey's North Anatolian fault system. From 1939 to 1999, the Anatolian fault system had witnessed ten earthquakes of M6.6 or greater. The evolution of the Coulomb stress changes along the North Anatolian fault as a result of these earthquakes showed that 11 of the 13 ruptures occurred in areas of increased Coulomb stress caused by a previous rupture. This method has been also used to predict seismicity around active volcanoes submitted to significant variation of stress in the magma chamber.\n\nAlthough no official Coulomb stress transfer prediction model is being used by government agencies, geologic surveys often analyze earthquake threats using Coulomb stress theory. As an example, the last of the previous thirteen earthquakes along Turkey's North Anatolian Fault, near the town of Duzce, was successfully predicted by local geologists before the rupture occurred. This allowed for engineers to evacuate unstable structures and limit significant damage. Scientists estimate that the probability of another earthquake along the Anatolian fault system is 62% over the next 30 years and will be located threateningly close to Istanbul.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1982914", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982914", "title": "Ghazan", "text": "Ghazan\n\nMahmud Ghazan (1271– 11 May 1304) (, , Ghazan Khan, sometimes referred to as Casanus by Westerners) was the seventh ruler of the Mongol Empire's Ilkhanate division in modern-day Iran from 1295 to 1304. He was the son of Arghun, grandson of Abaqa Khan and great-grandson of Hulagu Khan continuing a long line of rulers who were direct descendants of Genghis Khan. Considered the most prominent of the Ilkhans, he is best known for making a political conversion to Islam and meeting Imam Ibn Taymiyya in 1295 when he took the throne, marking a turning point for the dominant religion of Mongols in Western Asia (Iran, Iraq, Anatolia and Transcaucasia). One of the many principal wives of him was Kököchin, a Mongol princess (originally betrothed to Ghazan's father Arghun before his death) sent by his great-uncle Kublai Khan.\n\nMilitary conflicts during Ghazan's reign included war with the Egyptian Mamluks for control of Syria, and battles with the Turko-Mongol Chagatai Khanate. Ghazan also pursued diplomatic contacts with Europe, continuing his predecessors' unsuccessful attempts at forming a Franco-Mongol alliance. A man of high culture, Ghazan spoke multiple languages, had many hobbies, and reformed many elements of the Ilkhanate, especially in the matter of standardizing currency and fiscal policy.\n\nGhazan's parents were Arghun and his concubine Kultak egechi of the Dörben tribe. At time of their marriage Arghun was 12. Kultak's elder sister Ashlun was the wife of Tübshin, son of Hulagu and previous viceroy in Khorasan. According to Rashid al-Din, marriage took place in Mazandaran, where Arghun was viceroy. Ghazan was born on 5 November 1271 in Abaskun (near modern Bandar Turkman) though he was raised in the Ordo (nomadic palace-tent) of his grandfather Abaqa's favorite wife, Buluqhan Khatun, who herself was childless. Ghazan and Arghun didn't see each other until Abaqa's attack on Qaraunas in 1279 where they briefly met.\n\nGhazan was raised Buddhist, as was his brother Oljeitu. The Mongols were traditionally tolerant of multiple religions, and during Ghazan's youth, he was educated by a Chinese monk, who taught him Buddhism, as well as the Mongolian and Uighur scripts.\n\nHe lived together with Gaykhatu in Buluqhan Khatun's encampment in Baghdad after Abaqa's death. He reunited again with his father when Buluqhan khatun wed to Arghun and became Ghazan's step-mother.\n\nAfter the overthrow of Tekuder in 1284, Ghazan's father Arghun was enthroned as Ilkhan, the 11-year-old Ghazan became viceroy, and he moved to the capital of Khorasan, never to see Arghun again. Emir Tegene was appointed as his deputy, whom he didn't like very much. In 1289, conflict with other Mongols ensued when a revolt was led against Arghun by Nawruz, a young emir of the Oirat clan, whose father had been civil governor of Persia before the arrival of Hulagu. Ghazan's deputy Tegene was among victims of Nawruz's raid on 20 April 1289 in which he was captured and imprisoned. Nawruz's protege, Prince Hulachu was arrested by Ghazan's commander Mulay ten days later. When Nawruz was defeated by Arghun's reinforcements in 1290, fled the Ilkhanate and joined the alliance of Kaidu, another descendant of Genghis Khan who was the ruler of both the House of Ögedei and the neighboring Chagatai Khanate. Ghazan spent the next ten years defending the frontier of the Ilkhanate against incursions by the Chagatai Khanate of Central Asia.\n\nWhen his father, Arghun, died in 1291, Ghazan was prevented from pursuing his claim of leadership in the capital because he was engaged both with Nawruz's raids, and dealing with rebellion and famine in Khorasan and Nishapur. Taghachar, an army commander who had served the previous three generations of Ilkhans, was probably behind the death of Arghun, and supported Ghazan's uncle Gaykhatu as the new Ilkhan. Despite being boyhood rivals, Gaykhatu sent aid to Ghazan's fight against Nawruz in Khorasan under leadership of Prince Anbarchi (son of Möngke Temür) and emirs Tuladai, Quncuqbal and El Temür; himself going to Anatolia to quell Turcoman uprisings. However, famine reached his court too in spring and Anbarchi, unable to feed his soldiers had to leave soon for Azerbaijan again. He again tried to visit Gaykhatu, but after his refusal, he had to go back. She received Kökechin on his way back from Tabriz to Khorasan. She had been brought from the Yuan Dynasty from the east in a caravan which included Marco Polo among hundreds of others. She had originally been betrothed to Ghazan's father, the Ilkhan Arghun, but since he had died during her months-long journey, she instead married his son Ghazan.\n\nIn 1294, Ghazan forced Nawruz to surrender at Nishapur and Nawruz then became one of Ghazan's lieutenants. Ghazan was loyal to his uncle, though he refused to follow Gaykhatu's lead in introducing paper currency to his province, explaining that the weather of Khorasan was too humid to handle paper.\n\nIn 1295, Taghachar and his conspirators, who probably had been behind the death of Arghun, had his successor Gaykhatu killed as well. They then placed the controllable Baydu, a cousin of Ghazan, on the throne. Baydu was primarily a figurehead, allowing the conspirators to divide the Ilkhanate among themselves. Hearing Gaykhatu's murder, Ghazan marched on Baydu. Baydu explained the fact that Ghazan was away during events leading to Gaykhatu's fall, therefore nobles had no choice but to raise him to throne. Nevertheless, Amir Nowruz encouraged Ghazan to take steps against Baydu, because he was nothing but a figurehead under grips of nobles. Baydu's forces commanded by Ildar (his cousin and Prince Ajay's son), Eljidei and Chichak met him near Qazvin. Ghazan's army were commanded by Prince Sogai (son of Yoshmut), Buralghi, Nowruz, Qutluqshah and Nurin Aqa. First battle was won by Ghazan but he had to fall back after realising Ildar's contingent was just a fraction of whole army, leaving Nowruz behind. Nevertheless, he captured Arslan, a descendant of Jochi Qasar.\n\nAfter a short truce, Baydu offered Ghazan co-ruling of ilkhanate and Nowruz the post of \"sahib-i divan\" to which as a counter-condition Ghazan demanded the revenues of his father's hereditary lands in Fars, Persian Iraq and Kerman. Nowruz denied conditions, which led to its arrest. According to an anecdote, he promised to bring Ghazan back tied-up on condition of his release. Once he reached Ghazan, he sent back a cauldron to Baydu; a word play on the Turkish word kazan. Nowruz promised him the throne and his help on a condition of Ghazan's conversion to Islam. Ghazan converted to Islam, on June 16, 1295, at the hands of Ibrahim ibn Muhammad ibn al-Mu'ayyid ibn Hamaweyh al-Khurasani al-Juwayni as a condition for Nawruz's military support. Nowruz entered Qazvin with 4000 soldiers and claimed an additional number of 120.000 soldiers commanded by Ebügen (in other sources, 30.000) - descendant of Jochi Qasar - on his way towards Azerbaijan which caused panic among masses which was followed by defections of Taghachar's subordinates (thanks to Taghachar's vizier Sadr ul-Din Zanjani) and other powerful emirs like Qurumishi and Chupan on 28 August 1295.\n\nSeeing imminent defeat, Baydu asked for Taghachar's support, ignorant of his defection. After realising Taghachar's withraw, he fled to Emir Tukal in Georgia on 26 September 1295. Ghazan's commanders found him near Nakhchivan and arrested him, taking back to Tabriz, having him executed on October 4, 1295.\n\nHe declared his victory after execution of Baydu in outskirts of Tabriz on 4 October 1295, he entered the city. After declaration, several appointments, orders and executions came as usual - Gaykhatu's son Alafrang's son-in-law Eljidai Qushchi was executed, Nawruz was rewarded with naibate of state and was given extreme power, akin to Buqa's back in the day of Arghun. Nawruz on his part issued a formal edict in opposition to other religions in the Ilkhanate. Nawruz loyalists persecuted Buddhists and Christians to such an extent that Iranian Buddhism never recovered, the Nestorian cathedral in the Mongol capital of Maragha was looted, and churches in Tabriz and Hamadan were destroyed. Baydu loyalists too were purged - emirs Jirghadai and Qoncuqbal were executed on 10 and 15 October respectively. Qoncuqbal was specifically hated for his murder of Aq Buqa Jalair, his executioner was Nawruz's brother Hajji, who was also Aq Buqa's son-in-law. Taghachar's protege, Sadr ul-Din Zanjani was granted the office of vizierate, following deposition of Baydu's vizier Jamal ud-Din. He re-appointed Taghachar to Anatolian viceroyalty on 10 November 1295. Another series of executions came after 1296: Prince Ajai's son Ildar fled to Anatolia on 6 February but was captured and executed; Yesütai, an Oirat commander who supported Hulagu's son-in-law Taraghai in his migration to Mamluk Syria was executed on 24 May and Buralghi Qiyatai, a commander who was rebellious against Arghun was executed on 12 February.\n\nMeanwhile Nogai, kingmaker in Golden Horde was murdered and his wife Chubei fled to Ghazan with his son Torai (or Büri) who was Abaqa's son-in-law in 1296.\n\nGhazan eased the troubles with the Golden Horde, but the Ögedeids and Chagataids in Central Asia continued to pose a serious threat to both the Ilkhanate and his overlord and ally the Great Khan in China. When Ghazan was crowned, the Chagatayid Khan Duwa invaded Khorasan on 9 December 1295. Ghazan sent two of his relatives - Prince Sogai (son of Yoshmut) and Esen Temür (son of Qonqurtai) against the army of Chagatai Khanate but they deserted, believing this was Nawruz's plot further deprive nobility of their possessions. Nawruz informed Ghazan of this plot, subsequently executed them in 1296. Another Borjigid prince, Arslan who was captured by Ghazan previously and pardoned, revolted in Bilasuvar. After series of battles near Baylaqan he too was captured and executed alongside with rebellious emirs on 29 March.\n\nFollowing purge of princes, Taghachar was thought to have been implicated in the rebellion of Prince Sogai and was declared a rebel. Taghachar strengthened himself in Tokat and resisted against Ghazan's commanders Harmanji, Baltu and Arap (son of Samagar). He was soon arrested by Baltu near Delice and was delivered to Ghazan in 1296. Shortly afterwards Ghazan reluctantly ordered the murder of Taghachar; he recognised that he had been a help and that he was not an imminent threat, and explained his decision by reference to Chinese story about execution of a commander who saved a future emperor by betraying a former one. His protege Sadr ul-Din Zanjani was revoked from vizierate and arrested in March 1296, but pardoned thanks to intervention of Buluqhan Khatun.\n\nPurges were followed by executions of Chormaqan's grandson Baighut on 7 September 1296, Hazaraspid ruler Afrasiab I in October 1296, Baydu's vizier Jamal ud-Din Dastgerdani on 27 October 1296.\n\nTaghachar's death triggered revolts of Baltu of the Jalayir in Anatolia where he was stationed since Abaqa's reign. He was supported by Ildar (son of Qonqurtai), who was arrested and executed in September 1296. Two months later, Qutluqshah invaded Anatolia with 30.000 men and crushed Baltu's revolt, arresting him in June. He was brought to Tabriz and jailed there until 14 September 1297, when he was executed along with his son. Seljuk Sultan of Rum Mesud II on the other hand was arrested and jailed in Hamadan.\n\nNawruz soon embroiled himself in argument with Nurin Aqa, who was more popular in military and left Khorasan. After returning to west, he survived an assassination attempt by a soldier named Tuqtay, who claimed that Nawruz murdered his own father, Arghun Aqa. Soon he was accused of treason by Sadr al-Din Khaladi, \"sahib-divan\" of Ghazan by secret alliance with Mamlukes. Indeed, according to Mamluk sources, Nawruz corresponded with Sultan Lajin. Using opportunity Ghazan started a purge against Nawruz and his followers in May 1297. His brother Hajji Narin and his follower Satalmish were executed among Nawruz's children in Hamadan, his other brother Lagzi Güregen was also put to death in Iraq on 2 April 1297. His 12 year old son Toghai was spared due to efforts of Bulughan Khatun Khurasani, Ghazan's wife Arghun Aqa's granddaughter and given to household of Amir Husayn. Along spared, were his brother Yol Qutluq and his nephew Kuchluk. Later that year Ghazan marched against Nawrūz himself, who at the time was the commander of the army of Khorassan. Ghazan's forces were victorious at a battle near Nishapur. Nawrūz took refuge at the court of the \"Malik\" (king) of Herat in northern Afghanistan, but the Malik betrayed him and delivered Nawruz to Qutlughshah, who had Nawruz executed immediately on August 13.\n\nGhazan maintained strong ties with the Great Khan of the Yuan and the Golden Horde. In 1296 Temür Khan, the successor of the Kublai Khan, dispatched a military commander Baiju to Mongol Persia. Five years later Ghazan sent his Mongolian and Persian retainers to collect income from Hulagu's holdings in China. While there, they presented tribute to Temür and were involved in cultural exchanges across Mongol Eurasia. Ghazan also called upon other Mongol Khans to unite their will under the Temür Khan, in which he was supported by Kaidu's enemy Bayan Khan of the White Horde. Ghazan's court had Chinese physicians present.\n\nIn order to stabilize the country Ghazan attempted to control the situation and continued the executions - Taiju (son of Möngke Temür) on 15 April 1298 on charges of sedition, vizier Sadr ul-Din Zanjani on 4 May and his brother Qutb ul-Din and with cousin Qawam ul-Mulk on 3 June on charges of embezzlement, Abu Bakr Dadqabadi on 10 October. Ghazan appointed a Jewish convert to Islam - Rashid-al-Din Hamadani as new vizier succeeding Sadr ul-Din Zanjani, a post which Rashid held for the next 20 years, until 1318. Ghazan also commissioned Rashid-al-Din to produce a history of the Mongols and their dynasty, the \"Jami' al-tawarikh\" \"Compendium of Chronicles\" or \"Universal History\". Over several years of expansion, the work grew to cover the entire history of the world since the time of Adam, and was completed during the reign of Ghazan's successor, Oljeitu. Many copies were made, a few of which survive to the modern day.\n\nAfter Taiju's execution, he appointed Nurin Aqa as viceroy of Arran on 11 September 1298.\n\nSulemish (grandson of Baiju), whom Qutlughshah appointed as viceroy in Anatolia after Baltu's revolt, rebelled himself in 1299. Assembling a force of 20.000 strong army which postponed Ghazan's plan to invade Syria. Qutlugshah was forced to come back from Arran and won a victory against him, on 27 April 1299 near Erzinjan, causing rebel to flee to Mamluk Egypt. He returned with the Mamluk reinforcements to Anatolia but defeated again. He was brought to Tabriz and executed by burning on 27 September 1299.\n\nGhazan was one of a long line of Mongol leaders who engaged in diplomatic communications with the Europeans and Crusaders in attempts to form a Franco-Mongol alliance against their common enemy, primarily the Egyptian Mamluks. He already had the use of forces from Christian vassal countries such as Cilician Armenia and Georgia. The plan was to coordinate actions between Ghazan's forces, the Christian military orders, and the aristocracy of Cyprus to defeat the Egyptians, after which Jerusalem would be returned to the Europeans. Many Europeans are known to have worked for Ghazan, such as Isol the Pisan or Buscarello de Ghizolfi, often in high positions. Hundreds of such Western adventurers entered into the service of Mongol rulers. According to historian Peter Jackson, the 14th century saw such a vogue of Mongol things in the West that many new-born children in Italy were named after Mongol rulers, including Ghazan: names such as \"Can Grande\" (\"Great Khan\"), \"Alaone\" (Hulagu, Ghazan's great-grandfather), \"Argone\" (Arghun, Ghazan's father) or \"Cassano\" (Ghazan) were recorded with a high frequency.\n\nIn October 1299, Ghazan marched with his forces towards Syria and invited the Christians to join him. His army took the city of Aleppo, and was there joined by his vassal King Hethum II of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, whose forces included some Templars and Hospitallers, and who participated in the rest of the offensive. The Mongols and their allies defeated the Mamluks in the Battle of Wadi al-Khazandar, on December 23 or 24, 1299. One group of Mongols then split off from Ghazan's army and pursued the retreating Mamluk troops as far as Gaza, pushing them back to Egypt. The bulk of Ghazan's forces proceeded to Damascus, which surrendered somewhere between December 30, 1299, and January 6, 1300, though its Citadel resisted. Most of Ghazan's forces then retreated in February, probably because their horses needed fodder. He promised to return in the winter of 1300–1301 to attack Egypt. About 10,000 horsemen under the Mongol general Mulay were left to briefly rule Syria, before they too retreated.\n\nGhazan was indeed feared and despised by the Mamluks, who sent a delegation of leading scholars and imams including Ibn Taymiyya, north from Damascus to al-Nabk, where Ghazan was encamped, in January 1300, in order to persuade Ghazan to stop his attack on Damascus. Ibn Taymiyya also may have met Ghazan in Damascus in August 1301. On one of these occasions, it is reported that not one of the scholars dared to say anything to Ghazan except Ibn Taymiyyah who said:\n\n\"\"You claim that you are Muslim and you have with you Mu'adhdhins, Muftis, Imams and Shaykhs but you invaded us and reached our country for what? Although your father and your grandfather, Hulagu were non-believers, they did not attack us and they kept their promise. But you promised and broke your promise.\"\"\n\nIt is reported on the Mu'jamus Shuyuukh, Ibn Hajar Al-Asqalani said that Mongol leader who was apostate when he struggled against Mamluks and he converted to Christianity and built the Nestorian Cathedral to dedicated himself. He prefer to ally with Crusade Nations and he had chosen to attack Mamluks army and slaughtered them. The Mongol leader none other than was Ghazan Khan.\n\nIn July 1300, the Crusaders formed a small fleet of sixteen galleys with some smaller vessels to raid the coast, and Ghazan's ambassador traveled with them. The Crusader forces also attempted to establish a base at the small island of Ruad, from which raids were launched on Tartus while awaiting Ghazan's forces. However, the Mongol army was delayed, and the Crusader forces retreated to Cyprus, leaving a garrison on Ruad which was besieged and captured by Mamluks by 1303 (see Siege of Ruad).\nIn February 1301, the Mongols advanced again with a force of 60,000, but could do little else than engage in some raids around Syria. Ghazan's general Kutlushah stationed 20,000 horsemen in the Jordan Valley to protect Damascus, where a Mongol governor was stationed. But again, they were soon forced to withdraw.\n\nPlans for combined operations with the Crusaders were again made for the following winter offensive, and in late 1301, Ghazan asked Pope Boniface VIII to send troops, priests, and peasants, in order to make the Holy Land a Frank state again. But again, Ghazan did not appear with his own troops. He wrote again to the Pope in 1302, and his ambassadors also visited the court of Charles II of Anjou, who on April 27, 1303 sent Gualterius de Lavendel as his own ambassador back to Ghazan's court.\n\nIn 1303, Ghazan sent another letter to Edward I via Buscarello de Ghizolfi, reiterating his great-grandfather Hulagu Khan's promise that the Mongols would give Jerusalem to the Franks in exchange for help against the Mamluks. The Mongols, along with their Armenian vassals, had mustered a force of about 80,000 to repel the raiders of the Chagatai Khanate, which was under the leadership of Qutlugh Khwaja. After their success there, they advanced again towards Syria. However, Ghazan's forces were utterly defeated by the Mamluks just south of Damascus at the decisive Battle of Marj al-Saffar in April 1303. It was to be the last major Mongol invasion of Syria.\n\nAfter military campaigns, Ghazan returned to his capital Ujan in July 1302 and made several appointments: Nirun Aqa and Öljaitü were reconfirmed in Arran and Khorasan as viceroys respectively, while Mulay was sent to Diyar Bakr and Qutluqshah was assigned to Georgia. He received a concubine from Andronikos II Palaiologos in 1302, who may be the Despina Khatun that later married to Öljaitü. On 17 September 1303, Ghazan betrothed his daughter Öljei Qutlugh to Bistam, son of his brother Öljaitü.\n\nAccording to Rashid al-Din, Ghazan became depressed after his wife Karamun's death on 21 January. He once told his amirs that \"life was a prison... and is not a benefit\". Later in March/April, he nominated his brother Öljaitü as his successor, as he had no son his own. Eventually, he died on 17 May 1304 near Qazvin.\n\nAs part of his conversion to Islam, Ghazan changed his first name to the Islamic \"Mahmud\", and Islam gained popularity within Mongol territories. He showed tolerance for multiple religions, encouraged the original archaic Mongol culture to flourish, tolerated the Shiites, and respected the religions of his Georgian and Armenian vassals. Ghazan therefore continued his forefather's approach toward religious tolerance. When Ghazan learned that some Buddhist monks feigned conversion to Islam due to their temples being earlier destroyed, he granted permission to all who wished to return to Tibet, Kashmir or India where they could freely follow their faith and be among other Buddhists. The Mongol Yassa code remained in place and Mongol shamans remained politically influential throughout the reign of both Ghazan and his brother and successor Oljeitu, but ancient Mongol traditions eventually went into decline after Oljeitu's demise. Other religious upheaval in the Ilkhanate during Ghazan's reign was instigated by Nawruz, Ghazan put a stop to these exactions by issuing an edict exempting the Christians from the \"jizya\" (tax on non-Muslims), and re-established the Christian Patriarch Mar Yaballaha III in 1296. Ghazan reportedly punished religious fanatics who destroyed churches and synagogues in Tabriz on 21 July 1298.\n\nGhazan was a man of high culture, with many hobbies including linguistics, agro-techniques, painting, and chemistry. According to the Byzantine historian Pachymeres (1242–1310): \"No one surpassed him, in making saddles, bridles, spurs, greaves and helmets; he could hammer, stitch and polish, and in such occupations employed the hours of his leisure from war.\" Ghazan spoke numerous languages, including Chinese, Arabic, and \"Frank\" (probably Latin), as well as his own native language Mongolian.\n\nIn addition to his religious deep impact on Persia, Ghazan had unified measures, coinage and weights in the Ilkhanate. He ordered a new census in Persia to define the Dynasty's fiscal policy. He began to reuse wilderness, non-producing and abandoned lands to raise crops, strongly supporting the use and introduction of Eastern Asian crops in Persia, and improved the Yam system. He constructed hostels, hospitals, schools, and posts. Envoys from the court received a per diem stipend, and those of the nobility traveled at their own expense. Ghazan ordered only envoys bearing urgent military intelligence to use the staffed postal relay service. Mongol soldiers were given iqtas by the Ilkhanid court, where they were allowed to gather revenue provided by a piece of land. Ghazan also banned lending at interest.\n\nGhazan reformed the issuance of \"jarliqs\" (edicts), creating set forms and graded seals, ordering that all jarliqs be kept on file at court. Jarliqs older than 30 years were to be cancelled, along with old paizas (Mongol seals of authority). He fashioned new paizas into two ranks, which contained the names of the bearers on them to prevent them from being transferred. Old paizas were also to be turned in at the end of the official's term.\n\nIn fiscal policy, Ghazan introduced a unified bi-metallic currency including Ghazani dinars, and reformed purchasing procedures, replacing the traditional Mongol policy on craftsmen in the Ilkhanate, such as organizing purchases of raw materials and payment to artisans. He also opted to purchase most weapons on the open market. \n\nOn coins, Ghazan omitted the name of the Great Khan, instead inscribing his own name upon his coins in Iran and Anatolia. But he continued to diplomatic and economic relations with the Great Khan at Dadu. In Georgia, he minted coins with the traditional Mongolian formula \"Struck by the Ilkhan Ghazan in the name of Khagan\" because he wanted to secure his claim on the Caucasus with the help of the Great Khans of the Yuan Dynasty. He also continued to use the Great Khan's Chinese seal which declared him to be a wang (prince) below the Great Khan.\n\nHis reforms also extended to the military, as several new guard units, mostly Mongols, were created by Ghazan for his army center. However, he restricted new guards' political significance. Seeing Mongol commoners selling their children into slavery as damaging to both the manpower and the prestige of the Mongol army, Ghazan budgeted funds to redeem Mongol slave boys, and made his minister Bolad (the ambassador of the Great Khan Kublai) commander of a military unit of redeemed Mongol slaves.\n\nGhazan had nine wives, 5 of them being principal wives and one being concubine:\n\n\n"}

Each of the eleven elects a Member of Parliament (MP) to represent it at the United Kingdom (UK) Parliament in Westminster. As of the 2017 general election, all of Hertfordshire's eleven MPs are Conservatives. The county currently has two urban borough constituencies (BC) – Broxbourne and Watford – while the other nine are classed as more rural county constituencies (CC).\n\nHertfordshire has been represented in Parliament since 1290. The number of MPs and the parts represented have changed considerably over time. The number of MPs representing the county increased from four in 1885 to eleven in 1997, being increased by one at each major redistribution which came into effect for the general elections of 1918, 1945, 1950, 1955, February 1974, 1983 and 1997. The penultimate recommendations made by the Boundary Commission for England still stand, effected by the Parliamentary Constituencies (England) Order 2007 as used since the 2010 general election. Locally this saw minor alterations.\n\nLimits of the seats were amended by the Fifth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies carried out by the Boundary Commission for England for future elections which have included 2010, 2015, 2017 and 2019. Each constituency is made up of whole or partial local government wards, which elect councillors at English local elections. Nine are designated as county constituencies (in which candidates can spend more per head than their borough counterparts). Two are borough constituencies.\n\nHertfordshire was first represented in the English parliament in the thirteenth century, during the reign of King Edward I. Edward held a meeting of Parliament in the county in 1295. By 1307, the county's representation in parliament consisted of two representatives, known as Knights of the Shire, who represented the county as a whole. In addition, the city of St Albans and borough of Hertford elected two representatives of their own. Parliament's role evolved over the next five centuries, from a body existing primarily to advise the monarch on taxation, into a legislative body in its own right following the English Civil War. However, Hertfordshire's constituency makeup within it remained unchanged until 1832, when the County's representation was increased to 3 MPs by the Great Reform Act. In 1852, the constituency of St Albans was disenfranchised and under the Reform Act of 1867, the representation of the Boroughs of Hertford was reduced to 1 MP.\n\nUnder the Reform Acts of 1832, 1867 and 1884–85, it became more common for constituencies to be represented by a single MP. This became universal on the abolition of the last few few two-member Boroughs and last university constituencies under the Representation of the People Act 1948. Before these reforms, the House of Commons had far fewer constituencies – the majority of which were represented by two and, in a few cases, more than two MPs and such instances locally are listed below, with the increase or reduction in representation being implemented at general elections held in those years.\nUnder the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 the County was divided into four single-member constituencies, namely the Eastern of Hertford Division (which absorbed the abolished Parliamentary Borough of Hertford), the Northern or Hitchin Division, the Mid or St Albans Division and the Western or Watford Division.\n\nThe table shows an approximate representation of the development of constituencies in Hertfordshire since 1885. The text below gives a more detailed description.\n\nConstituency containing the town of Harpenden\n\nUnder the Representation of the People Act 1918, the additional County Division of Hemel Hempstead was created. This was largely formed from the northern half of the Watford Division, including Hemel Hempstead, Berkhamsted and Tring and also included north-western part of the St Albans Division, including Harpenden.\n\nDuring this period, the demographics of voters in the county changed significantly, with four new towns being designated in the county in the three years from 1946–48. Meanwhile the eligibility to vote was extended from men who held property of a high enough value, to universal suffrage for all adults over the age of 21, as a result of the Representation of the People Acts in 1918 and 1928.\n\nThe House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1944 set up Boundaries Commissions to carry out periodic reviews of the distribution of parliamentary constituencies. It also authorised an initial review to subdivide abnormally large constituencies (those exceeding an electorate of 100,000) in time for the 1945 election. This was implemented by the Redistribution of Seats Order 1945 under which Hertfordshire was allocated an additional seat. As a consequence, the new County Constituency of Barnet was formed from the St Albans constituency, comprising the Urban Districts of Barnet and East Barnet, and the Rural District of Elstree.\n\nThe Representation of the People Act 1948 increased the county's representation once again, from 6 to 7 MPs, with the creation of the County Constituency of South West Hertfordshire, which was formed from the old Watford constituency, excluding the part comprising the Municipal Borough of Watford (which comprised the redesignated Borough Constituency of Watford). The new seat also included the parish of Abbots Langley, transferred from Hemel Hempstead. Elsewhere, the Rural District of Welwyn was transferred from Hitchin to St Albans, the Rural District of Hatfield from St Albans to Barnet and the parish of Wheathampstead from St Albans to Hemel Hempstead.\n\nThe First Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies resulted in the creation of the County Constituency of East Hertfordshire from the bulk of the Hertford constituency, with a small rural area transferred from Hitchin. Hertford saw significant changes with only the Municipal Borough and the part of the Rural District of Hertford retained. The Urban District of Welwyn Garden City and the Rural District of Welwyn were transferred from St Albans; the Rural District of Hatfield was transferred from Barnet; and the remainder of the Rural District of Hertford was transferred from Hitchin.\n\nThe next national boundary change came into effect for the February 1974 election following the recommendations of the Second Periodic Review and saw significant changes affecting Hertfordshire. Three new constituencies were introduced, offset by the abolition of two. Only Watford remained unchanged.\n\nBarnet was abolished following the creation of the county of Greater London nine years earlier in 1965. The Urban Districts of Barnet and East Barnet had been incorporated into the London Borough of Barnet in Greater London and now formed the basis for the new Borough Constituency of Chipping Barnet. The Rural District of Elstree was retained in Hertfordshire and was included in the new County Constituency of South Hertfordshire which also comprised the Urban District of Potters Bar which had been transferred from Middlesex to Hertfordshire following the creation of Greater London and was now transferred from the abolished Borough Constituency of Enfield West. The parish of Aldenham in the Rural District of Watford was transferred from South West Hertfordshire and the parishes of Colney Heath, London Colney and St Stephen in the Rural District of St Albans were transferred from St Albans. In turn, Harpenden and Redbourn were transferred from Hemel Hempstead to St Albans.\n\nHertford was also abolished, with the Municipal Borough and Rural District of Hertford being included in the new County Constituency of Hertford and Stevenage. The Urban District of Stevenage, which formed the greater part of the new constituency, was transferred from Hitchin and the Urban District of Ware was transferred from East Hertfordshire. The remaining parts of the Hertford constituency formed the new County Constituency of Welwyn and Hatfield.\n\nThe Third Review reflected the 1974 local government reorganisation arising from the Local Government Act 1972 and resulted in another significant redistribution. It saw the formation of Broxbourne, Hertford and Stortford, Hertsmere, North Hertfordshire, Stevenage and West Hertfordshire, replacing the abolished constituencies of East Hertfordshire, Hemel Hempstead, Hertford and Stevenage, Hitchin and South Hertfordshire – a net increase of one seat.\n\nBroxbourne was formed as a Borough Constituency, primarily from southern parts of the abolished constituency of East Hertfordshire, mainly consisting of the former Urban Districts of Cheshunt and Hoddesdon which had been combined to form the District of Broxbourne under the local government reorganisation. The rest of East Hertfordshire, including Bishop's Stortford and Sawbridgeworth, together with Hertford and Ware from the abolished constituency of Hertford and Stevenage, formed the new County Constituency of Hertford and Stortford, with Stevenage being created as a separate County Constituency.\n\nHitchin was replaced by North Hertfordshire, with a small part in the south-east being included in Stevenage (Codicote and Knebworth); Hemel Hempstead was largely replaced by West Hertfordshire, with Berkhamsted being transferred to South West Hertfordshire; and South Hertfordshire was largely replaced by Hertsmere, with Colney Heath being transferred back to St Albans and St Stephens transferred to Watford. In order to balance the electorates, South West Hertfordshire transferred Bushey and Abbots Langley to Hertsmere and Watford respectively and Wheathampstead was transferred from St Albans to Welwyn and Hatfield (renamed Welwyn Hatfield), which in turn transferred Northaw to Broxbourne.\n\nThe Fourth Review saw another increase in the number of constituencies, with the creation of Hitchin and Harpenden and North East Hertfordshire and the re-establishment of Hemel Hempstead, replacing the abolished constituencies North Hertfordshire and West Hertfordshire.\n\nHitchin and Harpenden combined the two towns of Hitchin, previously part of North Hertfordshire, and Harpenden, transferred from St Albans. The remainder of North Hertfordshire (including Letchworth, Baldock and Royston), together with some rural areas of Hertford and Stortford and Stevenage, formed the new constituency of North East Hertfordshire. Hemel Hempstead was reformed from West Hertfordshire, with Tring being transferred to South West Hertfordshire.\n\nTo compensate for the loss of Harpenden, St Albans gained St Stephens and Park Street, Bedmond, and London Colney from Watford, South West Hertfordshire and Hertsmere respectively. Other movements included the transfer of Stanstead Abbotts and Amwell from Broxbourne to Hertford and Stortford; Kings Langley from South West Hertfordshire to Hemel Hempstead; Wheathampstead from Welwyn Hatfield to Hitchin and Harpenden; and three District of Three Rivers wards from South West Hertfordshire to Watford.\n\nThe Boundary Commission for England decided not to change Hertfordshire's representation in Parliament for the 2010 election. It did however suggest slight boundary changes to reduce electoral disparity. The recommendations, which became law with the Parliamentary Constituencies (England) Order 2007, also ensured that local government wards in Hertfordshire would no longer be split between two Parliamentary constituencies.\nThe Boundary Commission for England submitted their final proposals in respect of the Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster Constituencies (the 2018 review) in September 2018. Although the proposals were immediately laid before Parliament they were not brought forward by the Government for approval. Accordingly, they did not come into effect for the 2019 election which took place on 12 December 2019, and which was contested using the constituency boundaries in place since 2010.\n\nUnder the terms of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011, the Sixth Review was based on reducing the total number of MPs from 650 to 600 and a strict electoral parity requirement that the electorate of all constituencies should be within a range of 5% either side of the electoral quota.\n\nOn 24 March 2020, the Minister of State for the Cabinet Office, Chloe Smith, issued a written statement to Parliament setting out the Government's thinking with regard to parliamentary boundaries. They propose to bring forward primary legislation to remove the statutory obligation to implement the 2018 Boundary Review recommendations, as well as set the framework for future boundary reviews in time for the next review which is due to begin in early 2021 and report no later than October 2023. It is proposed that the number of constituencies now remains at the current level of 650, rather than being reduced to 600, while retaining the requirement that the electorate should be no more than +/- 5% from the electoral quota.\n\n\"Primary data source:\" House of Commons research briefing - General election results from 1918 to 2019\n\nThe number of votes cast for each political party who fielded candidates in constituencies comprising Hertfordshire in the 2019 general election were as follows:\n\n1974 & 1979 - Liberal Party; 1983 & 1987 - SDP-Liberal Alliance\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Included in Other\n\n1974 & 1979 - Liberal Party; 1983 & 1987 - SDP-Liberal Alliance\n\nA cell marked → (with a different colour background to the preceding cell) indicates that the previous MP continued to sit under a new party name.\n\n\n\n"}

It is the area code for much of southeastern Los Angeles County, including Long Beach, and parts of northern Orange County.\n\nPrior to November 2, 1991; this region had been part of area code 213. On that date, most of the western and southern portions of the old 213 region became area code 310. On January 25, 1997, the southern portion of the old 310 territory split again to become the 562 area code.\n\n562 was originally meant to be an overlay code exclusively for cellular telephones and pagers for existing 310 area code customers in late 1995. However, the overlay (and all others in CA for years to come) was cancelled after cellular companies sued the California Public Utilities Commission to prevent a repeat of a similar split in New York City, where all 212 & 718 mobile customers were changed over to a new 917 NPA. Cellular technology was relatively new, and the industry argued that separate area codes for cellular customers created a stigma and would hurt sales as people wanted their home and cell phone numbers to be in the same area code. After years in court, the CPUC sided with the cellular industry, and so plans were made to split 310 instead.\n\nOne anomaly in this area code is that all of it is in Los Angeles County except for the cities of Seal Beach and Los Alamitos, which are in the very northwest corner of the Orange County coastline, portions of the city of La Habra, and the very small and northwest part of the city of Brea in the very northwest corner of inland Orange County. These exceptions exist because, at the time of 310's creation, Pacific Bell (now part of AT&T Inc.) was the primary telephone company for most of Southern California, whereas this region's primary telephone company was GTE (later Verizon and now part of Frontier). In fact, when 310 was carved out of the southern portion of the old 213 territory, Pacific Bell chose to move all of GTE's area code 213 exchanges into the 310 area code. As the primary telephone provider in Southern California, PacBell had the right to decide what exchanges stayed in 213.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She was urged by various political parties to run for the Senate in 2019, but refused to do so.\n\nVilma Santos is widely considered as the most lastingly successful Filipino movie and television actor of all time.\n\nShe started her acting career when one of her uncles, who was a cameraman at Sampaguita Pictures, convinced her to try out for the movies. Initially, Sampaguita Pictures had planned a child star role for her in \"Anak, Ang Iyong Ina\" (1969). When Santos was in the studio, she noticed a long line of little girls. Thinking that that line was the line for her audition, she decided to queue in. The long line turned out to be for an audition for Sampaguita Pictures' offering \"Trudis Liit\" (\"Little Trudis\").\n\nWhen it was her turn to audition, she was asked by the panel to sing, dance and cry on cue.

{"id": "1983032", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1983032", "title": "Peptide mass fingerprinting", "text": "Peptide mass fingerprinting\n\nPeptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) (also known as protein fingerprinting) is an analytical technique for protein identification in which the unknown protein of interest is first cleaved into smaller peptides, whose absolute masses can be accurately measured with a mass spectrometer such as MALDI-TOF or ESI-TOF. The method was developed in 1993 by several groups independently. The peptide masses are compared to either a database containing known protein sequences or even the genome. This is achieved by using computer programs that translate the known genome of the organism into proteins, then theoretically cut the proteins into peptides, and calculate the absolute masses of the peptides from each protein. They then compare the masses of the peptides of the unknown protein to the theoretical peptide masses of each protein encoded in the genome. The results are statistically analyzed to find the best match.\n\nThe advantage of this method is that only the masses of the peptides have to be known. Time-consuming de novo peptide sequencing is then unnecessary. A disadvantage is that the protein sequence has to be present in the database of interest. Additionally most PMF algorithms assume that the peptides come from a single protein. The presence of a mixture can significantly complicate the analysis and potentially compromise the results.\nTypical for the PMF based protein identification is the requirement for an isolated protein. Mixtures exceeding a number of 2-3 proteins typically require the additional use of MS/MS based protein identification to achieve sufficient specificity of identification (6). Therefore, the typical PMF samples are isolated proteins from two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D gels) or isolated SDS-PAGE bands. Additional analyses by MS/MS can either be direct, e.g., MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis or downstream nanoLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis of gel spot eluates.\n\nDue to the long, tedious process of analyzing proteins, peptide mass fingerprinting was developed. Edman degradation was used in protein analysis, and it required almost an hour to analyze one amino acid residue. SDS-PAGE was also used to separate proteins in very complex mixtures, which also employed methods of electroblotting and staining. Then, bands would be extracted from the gel and sequenced, automatically. A recurring problem in the process was that interfering proteins would also purify with the protein of interest. The sequences of these interfering proteins were compiled into what came to known as the Dayhoff database. Ultimately, having the sequences of these known protein contaminants in databases decreased instrument time and expenses involved in protein analysis.\n\nProtein samples can be derived from SDS-PAGE or reversed phase HPLC, and are then subject to some chemical modifications. Disulfide bridges in proteins are reduced and cysteine amino acids are carbamidomethylated chemically or acrylamidated during the gel electrophoresis.\n\nThen the proteins are cut into several fragments using proteolytic enzymes such as trypsin, chymotrypsin or Glu-C. A typical sample:protease ratio is 50:1. The proteolysis is typically carried out overnight and the resulting peptides are extracted with acetonitrile and dried under vacuum. The peptides are then dissolved in a small amount of distilled water or further concentrated and purified and are ready for mass spectrometric analysis.\n\nThe digested protein can be analyzed with different types of mass spectrometers such as ESI-TOF or MALDI-TOF. MALDI-TOF is often the preferred instrument because it allows a high sample throughout and several proteins can be analyzed in a single experiment, if complemented by MS/MS analysis. LC/ESI-MS and CE/ESI-MS are also great techniques for peptide mass fingerprinting.\n\nA small fraction of the peptide (usually 1 microliter or less) is pipetted onto a MALDI target and a chemical called a matrix is added to the peptide mix. Common matrices are Sinapinic acid, Alpha-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, and 2,3-Dihydroxybenzoic acid. The matrix molecules are required for the desorption of the peptide molecules. Matrix and peptide molecules co-crystallize on the MALDI target and are ready to be analyzed. There is one predominantly MALDI-MS sample preparation technique, namely dried droplet technique. The target is inserted into the vacuum chamber of the mass spectrometer and the desorption and ionisation of the polypeptide fragments is initiated by a pulsed laser beam which transfers high amounts of energy into the matrix molecules. The energy transfer is sufficient to promote the ionisation and transition of matrix molecules and peptides from the solid phase into the gas phase. The ions are accelerated in the electric field of the mass spectrometer and fly towards an ion detector where their arrival is detected as an electric signal. Their mass-to-charge ratio is proportional to their time of flight (TOF) in the drift tube and can be calculated accordingly.\n\nCoupling ESI with capillary LC can separate peptides from protein digests, while obtaining their molecular masses at the same time. Capillary electrophoresis coupled with ESI-MS is another technique; however, it works best when analyzing small amounts of proteins.\n\nThe mass spectrometric analysis produces a list of molecular weights of the fragments which is often called a peak list. The peptide masses are compared to protein databases such as Swissprot, which contain protein sequence information. Software performs \"in silico\" digests on proteins in the database with the same enzyme (e.g. trypsin) used in the chemical cleavage reaction. The mass of these peptide fragments is then calculated and compared to the peak list of measured peptide masses. The results are statistically analyzed and possible matches are returned in a results table.\n\n"}

Formerly the world's largest publicly traded online gambling firm, it was best known for its online poker room PartyPoker, World Poker Tour and its sports betting brand bwin (officially styled \"bwin\").\n\nThe company was headquartered in Gibraltar and quoted on the London Stock Exchange. PartyGaming Plc was founded in 1997 with the launch of Starluck Casino. Prior to passage of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 by the U.S. Congress, the firm was the world's largest online poker brand, based on cash game revenue and number of players. Its market share has fallen since then, but it remains the third largest online poker room in the world, behind PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker.\n\nThe new company became the world's largest publicly traded online gaming firm in 2010, 48.4% owned by existing PartyGaming shareholders and 51.6% by bwin shareholders. The merged company was listed on the London Stock Exchange, with joint CEOs Norbert Teufelberger and Jim Ryan.\n\nFollowing a protracted bidding process between 888 Holdings and GVC Holdings, Bwin.Party confirmed on 4 September 2015 that it had accepted GVC's bid for £1.1 billion. The transaction was completed on 1 February 2016.\n\nParty Gaming and Bwin merged on March 31, 2011. The rumors of a planned Bwin and Party merger began in November 2009, but were not confirmed until a joint statement was issued August 26, 2010. In December 2010 shareholders were sent a 478-page document with details and an outline of planned merger. On Jan 28, 2011 the merger was approved by shareholders and then completed on March 31, 2011.\n\nIn October 2012, bwin announced the sale of its leading online poker network, Ongame, to Amaya Gaming Group in a deal worth up to €25 million.\n\nIn November 2013 it was announced that bwin.party had applied for an online gaming licence for the state of New Jersey in July, and on 8 November had been awarded a transactional waiver by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement allowing it to participate in the online gaming market in the state, prior to a full licence being granted. The group launched both poker and casino games under the land-based casino licence of its New Jersey partner, Borgata Casino, the launch included both Borgata's and its own brands, including partypoker.com. By the end of December, the new partypoker site had acquired 50% of the cash game traffic in New Jersey.\n\nFollowing a protracted bidding process between 888 Holdings and GVC Holdings, Bwin.Party confirmed on 4 September 2015 that it had accepted GVC's bid for £1.1 billion. The transaction was completed on 1 February 2016, as indicated by cancellation of LSE traded shares on 2 February 2016.\n\nSports bets were the core business at bwin, with a sports betting lineup including more than 90 different sports; the principal customer interest is soccer. In order to boost bwin's presence in the UK football betting market, the company launched bwinbetting.com in 2011. Other sports included all popular ball-related sports, US sports as well as all major winter sports and motorsports ranging from Formula 1 to MotoGP. \"Exotic\" sports such as roller hockey, futsal and darts were also included in the daily lineup. Customers could also find odds on a range of events outside of sports. These included bets on politics and entertainment such as the Oscars, talent shows, the Eurovision Song Contest and \"Miss\" events.\n\nThe following types of games were offered at bwin Poker: Texas Hold'em, Omaha, Omaha Hi/Lo, Seven Card Stud, Seven Card Stud Hi/Lo and Five-card draw, plus house variations like Double (three hole cards, choose two, halfway between Hold'em and Omaha). In terms of stakes, users could choose between Fixed Limit, Pot Limit or No Limit tables. A \"play money\" version of the games was also available for users to try out for free. bwin offered poker tournaments, both Sit & Go and scheduled, and cash games (ring games). Sit & Go tournaments began as soon as the table was completely occupied. Scheduled tournaments began at a specified time and allowed for higher numbers of participants and the highest prize pools. In cash games the players could join and leave whenever they wanted. bwin Poker could be played using the Mac OS X Poker Client, the Windows Poker Client, the Java Poker Client or the Poker app for Android or the iPhone. The Mac and Windows version offered an extensive selection of features such as statistics and a mini-table function. The Java client was platform-independent as it was a browser-based solution. In January 2011, bwin launched a dedicated Poker app for the iPhone to allow real money poker. This was followed in July 2011 by a similar application for Android-based devices. The mobile client allowed customers to play cash games on their mobile phones. Both apps were restricted to limited territories as permitted by local laws.\n\nPokerRoom.com was an online poker cardroom founded in 1999. Licensed by the Kahnawake Gaming Commission, PokerRoom offered both play and real money formats. Tournaments and ring games were available in both web-browser and download client platforms, with support for both Macintosh and Linux. PokerRoom was one of the first online poker sites to provide multi-language support, and catered to Danish, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Russian, and Swedish speakers. These languages were accessed via \"regional sites\", many of them showing local sponsoring for the selected region. After 10 years of operation, bwin announced the closure of PokerRoom.com on 14 April 2009. It was relaunched in 2012 but shut down again on 19 February 2013.\n\nFollowing the acquisition of Cashcade in 2009, bwin.party took control of a B2C portfolio of online bingo brands including Foxy Bingo, PartyBingo and Cheeky Bingo. Cashcade was the first company to promote online bingo to a mass market via television advertising and was first to develop the \"free bingo\" concept to attract new customers. Bwin began offering bingo at the end of December 2009 when its Italian subsidiary, Gioco Digitale, launched bingo as the first authorised Italian private online gaming operator.\n\nbwin offered more than 100 games, ranging from classics such as roulette or blackjack to slot machines and casino tournaments. The casino has a longstanding tradition at bwin: In 2001, it was introduced as a second product, after sports betting. The biggest ever casino jackpot win happened in 2014 when an individual won a little over 6 million Euros.\n\nbwin offered more than 60 games divided into the categories of Fortune Games, Skill Games, Mini Games and \"ParaDice\", as well as Backgammon. This was the product group with the biggest potential for innovation and expansion on the market.\n\nAs the global legal framework for internet gambling is a complicated mix of laws and regulations, bwin's situation varied depending on the country concerned. Recently, Italy extended its online licences to include poker tournaments, and countries such as Denmark and Spain announced their intention to permit private operators access to their markets under stringent conditions and controls. On the other hand, other countries maintain a state monopoly on internet gaming, or ban it completely.\n\nOn 15 September 2006, Norbert Teufelberger and Manfred Bodner were arrested at a press conference in La Turbie, France, for allegedly breaking French gambling laws. After an investigation, a judge released them three days later. When France opened their market for private online gaming in June 2010, bwin became the first operator there.\n\nIn February 2013, the Australian Communications and Media Authority referred the Bwin arm of bwin.party to the Australian Federal Police for contraventions of the Interactive Gambling Act. The Act prohibits gambling companies from providing 'interactive' gambling services to those in Australia. Penalties for each breach, which can be for each day, are $220,000 for individuals and $1.1 million for corporations.\n\nBwin recently sponsored football giants Real Madrid, A.C. Milan and Bayern Munich and more recently Olympique de Marseille. In October 2010, Bwin announced a sponsorship for the upcoming three football seasons in which it would be the title sponsor of the Taça de Portugal, named the \"Bwin Cup\". Italy's second tier, Serie B, has already been re-branded \"Serie bwin\" after a two-year sponsorship deal was signed in July 2010.\n\nOn the 16 August 2012, bwin announced it was entering into a digital partnership with Manchester United to become the club's official online gaming and betting partner.\n\nIn the past, many other top events in the international and local sports world were supported by the corporation. Bwin also sponsored the Portuguese first football league (bwinLIGA) and has been partner to clubs such as Juventus and Werder Bremen.\n\nBwin cooperated with the International Basketball Association (FIBA) and has sponsored the European and World Basketball Championships since 2006. A second basketball sponsorship is Euroleague Basketball. Bwin's marketing and media rights agreement for Euroleague events expired in June 2014.\n\nIn the area of motorsport, the company was one of the main sponsors of the MotoGP series. In 2012, it was the title sponsor of the races in Jerez and GP in Brno and official partner of the Misano, Mugello and Silverstone. In December 2011, bwin announced it would be extending its Moto GP sponsorships through 2013.\n\nIn addition, Bwin organised numerous poker events both online and offline. One of the biggest regular online tournaments was the ChampionChip. Special poker tournaments like the Weekly Country Showdown or the Bwin Dailies offered a range of tournaments adjusted to country specifics and buy-in levels. Periodically, there were launched new types and variations of Sit & Go's. Also, several online qualifiers the Bwin user could qualify for offline events like the World Series of Poker (WSOP), the Aussie Millions and events on the World Poker Tour. For \"poker newbies\", Bwin offered the Rookie Challenge where a new poker player had the chance to climb up several stages for free to earn real money tickets.\n\nThe company faced some opposition in Europe over sponsorship of sports, especially football. In 2006, the German city of Bremen banned its top football club, Werder Bremen, from carrying the Bwin logo on its shirts.\n\nIn January 2014, the company announced major sponsorship deals with the New Jersey Devils and Philadelphia 76ers. The combined deals included major advertising to the fans of both teams and the creation of the Dream Seat Series, which was a series of online poker tournaments offering ticket packages to winners and other prizes to runners-up before every home game.\n"}
{"id": "1983035", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1983035", "title": "Alan Devonshire", "text": "Alan Devonshire\n\nAlan Ernest Devonshire (born 13 April 1956) is an English former professional footballer who is the current manager of Maidenhead United. He was a wide midfielder who played for West Ham United, with whom he won the FA Cup in 1980, and Watford, where he finished his career in 1992. Devonshire won eight caps for England between 1980 and 1983. He subsequently became a manager with Maidenhead United, Hampton & Richmond Borough and Braintree Town.\n\nBorn in Park Royal, then a part of Middlesex, Devonshire had been a schoolboy footballer but had been turned away by Crystal Palace at age 14 for being too small. He returned to Selhurst Park two years later and played a couple of youth team games but was again released by the club, this time by former West Ham player and Palace manager, Malcolm Allison. Devonshire started playing for non-league Southall and in doing so came to the attention of league clubs such as Reading, Southampton, and Brentford. By day he worked as a fork-lift truck driver at the Hoover Factory in Perivale, Middlesex. During this time he was spotted playing for Southall by West Ham United scouts, Eddie Baily and Charlie Faulkner who recommended him to West Ham manager, Ron Greenwood. Devonshire signed for West Ham United in 1976 for a fee of £5,000, a transfer which has led to him being referred to as \"West Ham's best ever buy\".\n\nDevonshire made his debut for West Ham on 27 October 1976 in a League Cup tie against Queens Park Rangers, in which West Ham lost 2–0. He made his League debut three days later on 30 October 1976 against West Bromwich Albion, where he played in a 3–0 defeat. He soon became a fans' favourite, who referred to him by his nickname \"Dev\". His workman-like attitude was one to which the fans could relate. He also enhanced his rapport with supporters by travelling to home game on the London Underground from his West London home.\n\nHe played 29 games in all competitions, without scoring, in his first season, the 1976–77 season. It was a poor season for West Ham who finished only two points above a relegation place in 17th place in the First Division. The following season, the 1977–78 season saw Devonshire's first goals for the club, in a 3–3 at Upton Park on 12 November 1977. It also saw him play 38 games in all competitions, scoring three goals. Unfortunately for West Ham his efforts could not prevent them from relegation to the Second Division after they finished in 20th place. The 1978–79 season saw West Ham rebuilding their side following relegation. Devonshire was a regular member of the side which finished 5th in the Second Division. He had played 41 of a possible 42 league games that season and was voted Hammer of the Season. West Ham failed to gain promotion again in the 1979–80 season. They did however reach the 1980 FA Cup Final where Devonshire collected an FA Cup winner's medal as West Ham beat favourites, holders and Cup Winners Cup finalists Arsenal 1–0 at Wembley with a single goal from Trevor Brooking from a cross by Devonshire. He had also scored a goal in a semi-final replay at Elland Road in a 2–1 win against Everton. \n\nIn the 1980–81 season Devonshire's career flourished. His partnership with Trevor Brooking formed the cornerstone of West Ham's push for promotion back to the First Division. He also played in European football for the first time and was a member of the side which reached to 1981 League Cup Final. He collected a Second Division title medal as they won promotion, losing only four games. Devonshire continued to be a regular member of the West Ham side in the First Division until a game on 7 January 1984. Playing against Wigan Athletic in the FA Cup, he snapped three ligaments in his right knee. He tried to make a comeback in March 1985 in two cup games against Wimbledon but again broke down. It was 19 months from his first injury to his full return, in a game against Birmingham City on 17 August 1985. His long spell out injured had resulted in him losing some of his pace but still maintaining his ability to pass the ball well. He made the final pass for many of the goals scored by teammates, Tony Cottee and Frank McAvennie in the 1985–86 season as West Ham finished third in the First Division.\n\nInjury struck Devonshire again in the first game of the 1987–88 season. Just 15 minutes in a game against Queens Park Rangers, he snapped his Achilles tendon. This forced him out of the game for over a year and by the time of his return the West Ham team were in decline. The 1988–89 season saw him play only 20 league games without scoring as West Ham were relegated back to the Second Division. For the 1989–90 season manager John Lyall was replaced by Lou Macari who undertook the rebuilding of the West Ham side. Devonshire was rarely used making only seven league appearances that season. Macari was replaced in the same season by Billy Bonds who granted Devonshire a free transfer in May 1990. His last appearance for West Ham came on 14 February 1990 when he was a substitute for Gary Strodder in a 6–0 away defeat to Oldham Athletic in a League Cup semi-final. His performance, and that of other experienced West Ham players, Liam Brady, Phil Parkes, Alvin Martin and Julian Dicks, was described as \"embarrassingly helpless\" in a game known as the \"St. Valentine's Day massacre\". Devonshire had played 448 competitive games over 14 years, scoring 32 goals.\n\nIn 1990 Devonshire signed for Watford, where he played for two years before dropping out of league football in 1992. He went on to serve non-league club Chippenham Sports as a player-coach.\n\nDevonshire was selected to play for England by his former manager at West Ham, Ron Greenwood. He made his debut on 20 May 1980 in a 1–1 draw against Northern Ireland. Greenwood selected him again on 31 May 1980 in a friendly game against Australia, which England won 2–1. Unfortunately for Devonshire his position and style of play were also those of Glenn Hoddle who was preferred as an international selection. He would have to wait two years for his next cap, on 25 May 1982 in a 2–0 win against Netherlands. Another game followed on 2 June 1982, a 1–1 draw against Iceland. Both of these games were warm-up games before the 1982 World Cup. Devonshire was omitted from the final squad for the tournament. New England manager, Bobby Robson attempting to rebuild an aging England team, selected Devonshire in October 1982. The game, against West Germany finished 2–1 to the Germans in a bad defeat for England. His final two appearances, against Greece and Luxembourg came towards the end of 1983 and were Devonshire's only appearances in competitive international games, the games being qualifiers for the 1984 UEFA European Football Championship.\n\nDevonshire began his management career as manager of non-league club Osterley and Brentford Women. He then became the manager of Hampton & Richmond Borough in the Conference South. He was previously manager of Maidenhead United.\n\nAs manager of Hampton & Richmond, he took the club from Isthmian League Division One South to the play-off-final of the Conference South. In his first season, he guided them to fifth place in the Isthmian Division One South which due to re-organization of the leagues was enough to see the club promoted to the Isthmian League Premier Division. He then guided the club to a sixth-placed finish in their debut season at that level missing out on the play-offs on goal difference on the final day of the season. The 2005–06 season would see Devonshire take the team into the play-offs. Having won a dramatic play-off semi-final on penalties away to Heybridge Swifts the team then faced Fisher Athletic away who beat Hampton 3–0. Devonshire finally managed to get Hampton & Richmond Borough promoted the following season in style by bringing the Isthmian Premier Division title to the Beveree. In their debut season in the Conference South he has managed to guide his team to third place in the league and into the play-offs for the Conference National.\n\nOn 23 May 2011, Devonshire was appointed the manager of newly promoted Conference National club Braintree Town. Having declined the offer of a new contract, Devonshire left the club on 17 April 2015. He was appointed manager of one of his former clubs, National League South side Maidenhead United, on 5 May 2015.\n\nDevonshire's father, Les, was a professional footballer with clubs including Chester City and Crystal Palace.\n\nHe has a race horse named after him.\n\n"}

Most surviving examples consist of a low horseshoe-shaped mound of charcoal-enriched soil, and heat shattered stone, with a cooking pit located in a slight depression at its centre. In ploughed fields, they are apparent as black spreads of earth interspersed with small sharp stones.\n\nFulacht fiadh examples are multiple in Ireland. The majority were constructed during the mid to late Bronze Age (c.1500- c. 500 BC), though some Neolithic and a few medieval examples are known. \nIn Great Britain and the Isle of Man they are known as burnt mounds, and similar objects are found in Sweden. Permanent structures are rarely found near to \"fulachtaí fiadh\", but small hut sites are common and it is unknown whether early sites were built by permanent settlements or nomadic hunters.\n\nMany historians suggest that the Irish word \"\"fulacht\"\" denotes a cooking pit. \"\"Fiadh\"\" in Old Irish meant something like \"wild\", often relating to animals such as deer. However, all acknowledge the difficulties in deriving a genuine etymology for the word \"\"fulacht\"\". As some historical texts clearly use the term \"fulacht\" to describe a cooking spit, a close reading of these accounts suggests that the term actually derives from a word meaning support and probably carries a deliberate reference to the Irish words for blood and meat.\n\n\"Fulachtaí fiadh\" are usually found close to water sources, such as springs, rivers and streams, or waterlogged ground. They were also sited close to sources of suitable stone where it could be obtained close to the surface. They required a source of fuel, so would have been close to woodland. They would also have to be in proximity to whatever was being processed by boiling in the trough. Once these conditions were met a \"fulacht fiadh\" could be constructed. Once the use of a \"fulacht fiadh\" had ended it was common for people to continue to make use of the local landscape, therefore \"fulachtaí fiadh\" tend to be found in groups strung out along water courses.\n\n\"Fulachtaí fiadh\" generally consist of three main elements: a mound of stones, a hearth used to heat the stones, and a trough, often lined with wood or stone, which was filled with water and into which the heated stones were placed to warm the water. Troughs may be cut into subsoil or, more rarely, into bedrock. The site may contain the remains of structures such as stone enclosures or even small buildings, and sometimes multiple hearths and additional, smaller pits. They are almost always found near running water, or in marshy areas where a hole dug into the ground would quickly fill with water.\n\nA number of the \"fulachtaí fiadh\" pits are approximately a metre wide by 2 metres long and maybe half a metre or more in depth. However, size can vary a great deal from site to site, from rather small pits lined with stones to pools conceivably large enough for people to bathe in.\n\nIt is postulated that these pits were filled with water and heated stones thrown in to create a pool of boiling water in which meat was cooked. This is because when excavated, \"fulachtaí fiadh\" are found with associated charred, scorched and broken rocks. The Ballyvourney reconstruction also included successful attempts at heating the water and cooking meat in this manner.\n\nOther theories suggest that the sites may have been used for bathing, the washing and dyeing of cloth, and leather working. Supporters of these theories point to the fact that no remains of foodstuffs have been found at the \"fulacht fiadh\" sites. Some researchers believe the \"fulachtaí fiadh\" were multi-purpose and could have, at least in some cases, been used for all of these activities - cooking, bathing, dyeing, or anything involving hot water. Some \"fulacht fiadh\" reconstructions, such as the one at Ballyvourney, include circular, hut-type structures based on the post holes found at the sites; some believe these small buildings were used for the storing and preparation of foodstuffs. Another theory is that the small buildings on site were used for enclosing heat and steam in a manner similar to the \"Tigh 'n Alluis\" Gaelic sweat-houses (which were built of stone), however, this theory does not take into account the fact that the hot water trough is located \"outside\" the buildings (when a building is even present at all).\n\nIn August 2007 two Galway based archaeologists suggested that \"fulachtaí fiadh\" were used primarily for the brewing of beer, and experimented by filling a large wooden trough with water and adding heated stones. Once the water had reached approximately 65 degrees Celsius they added barley and after 45 minutes transferred it to separate vessels to ferment, first adding wild plant flavourings and yeast. Some days later they discovered that it had transformed into a drinkable light ale.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1983053", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1983053", "title": "Difference gel electrophoresis", "text": "Difference gel electrophoresis\n\nDifference gel electrophoresis (DIGE) is a form of gel electrophoresis where up to three different protein samples can be labeled with size-matched, charge-matched spectrally resolvable fluorescent dyes (for example Cy3, Cy5, Cy2) prior to two dimensional gel electrophoresis.\n\nThe three samples are mixed and loaded onto IEF (isolectric focusing chromatography) for first dimension and the strip is transferred to a SDS PAGE. After the gel electrophoresis, the gel is scanned with the excitation wavelength of each dye one after the other, so each sample can be seen separately (if we scan the gel at the excitation wavelength of the Cy3 dye, we will see in the gel only the sample that was labeled with that dye). This technique is used to see changes in protein abundance (for example, between a sample of a healthy person and a sample of a person with disease), post-translational modifications, truncations and any modification that might change the size or isoelectric point of proteins. The binary shifts might be left to right (change in isoelectric point), vertical (change in size) or diagonal (change in both size and isoelectric point). Reciprocal Labeling is done to make sure the changes seen are not due to dye-dependent interactions.\n\nIt overcomes limitations in traditional 2D electrophoresis that are due to inter-gel variation. This can be considerable even with identical samples. Since the proteins from the different sample types (e.g. healthy/diseased, virulent/non-virulent) are run on the same gel they can be directly compared. To do this with traditional 2D electrophoresis requires large numbers of time-consuming repeats.\n\nIn experiments comprising several gels, a common technique is to include an internal standard in each gel. The internal standard is prepared by mixing together several or all of the samples in the experiment. This allows the measurement of the abundance of a protein in each sample relative to the internal standard. Since the amounts of each protein in the internal standard is known to be the same in every gel, this method reduces inter-gel variation.electrophoresis incorporating a pooled internal standard.\n\n"}

Established in 1942, the regiment was disbanded in 1957.\n\nThe German military was one of the pioneers of the use of airborne formations, conducting several successful airborne operations during the Battle of France in 1940, including the Battle of Fort Eben-Emael. Impressed by the success of German airborne operations, the Allied governments decided to form their own airborne formations. This decision would eventually lead to the creation of two British airborne divisions, as well as a number of smaller units. The British airborne establishment began development on 22 June 1940, when the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill, directed the War Office in a memorandum to investigate the possibility of creating a corps of 5,000 parachute troops.\n\nOn 21 June 1941, the Central Landing Establishment was formed at Ringway airfield near Manchester; although tasked primarily with training parachute troops, it was also directed to investigate the possibilities of using gliders to transport troops into battle. It had been decided that the Royal Air Force and the Army would co-operate in forming the airborne establishment. Squadron Leader Louis Strange and Major J.F. Rock were tasked with gathering together potential glider pilots and forming a glider unit; this was achieved by searching for members of the armed forces who had pre-war experience of flying gliders, or were interested in learning to do so.\n\nThe two officers and their newly formed unit were provided with four obsolescent Armstrong Whitworth Whitley bombers and a small number of Tiger Moth and Avro 504 biplanes, for towing purposes. Around this time the War Office and Air Ministry began to draw up specifications for several types of military gliders to be used by the unit. The resulting gliders were the General Aircraft Hotspur, General Aircraft Hamilcar, Airspeed Horsa and the Slingsby Hengist. These designs would take some time to be implemented and produced, however, and for the time being the fledgling unit was forced to improvise.\n\nA Glider Training Squadron was formed, and the first test-flights were conducted using Swallow light aircraft which had their propellers removed to simulate the flight characteristics of a glider; they were towed by the Whitleys using tow-ropes of varying number and length for experimentation purposes. Appeals were made throughout the United Kingdom for civilian gliders to be donated to the squadron, and the first four arrived in August 1941; three of them had been manufactured in pre-war Germany. Soon several more were donated, and these were put to use training instructors, glider pilots and newly formed ground crews. Accidents were quite frequent in these early months, primarily due to the hemp tow-ropes breaking during flight; these problems were only solved with the introduction of nylon tow-ropes imported from the USA. The first demonstration of the squadron's abilities took place on 26 September, when Prince George, Duke of Kent witnessed a demonstration of the fledgling airborne establishment's capabilities: four parachute-drops were conducted, and then two gliders were towed by civilian aircraft. This was followed on 26 October by a night exercise being conducted by the squadron, with two Avro 504s towing four gliders, and on 13 December five gliders were towed to Tatton Park, where they landed alongside sixteen parachutists dropped from two Whitley bombers.\n\nThere was a certain carefree atmosphere in the squadron in the first few months of its existence; new recruits were not obliged to pass a medical test to join the squadron, and it attracted a number of adventurous-minded men with a passion for flying, including a sergeant who had flown a Messerschmitt during the Spanish Civil War. These first pilots had been volunteers recruited from all branches of the armed forces, primarily the Army, but as the squadron began to conduct training exercises, arguments broke out between the RAF and the Army over the pilots. In the view of the RAF, gliders were aircraft and therefore came under their jurisdiction and should be controlled by them; the Army argued that as the glider pilots would subsequently be fighting alongside the troops they had transported, they should come under Army control. After much debate, a compromise was brokered between the two services: the pilots would be recruited from the Army but would be trained by the RAF.\n\nVolunteers were sought from the Army and had to be passed by RAF selection procedures before entering training. Once qualified as light aircraft pilots after a 12-week course, they were given further training on gliders: another 12-week course to qualify on the General Aircraft Hotspur. After a while they would then go to a Heavy Glider Conversion Unit for a six-week course so they were qualified for the Airspeed Horsa.\n\nIn 1942 the Glider Pilot Regiment came under a newly formed administrative corps, the Army Air Corps, alongside the Parachute Regiment and wartime Special Air Service, and the Air Observation Post squadrons of the Royal Artillery. In 1949, the AAC was broken up and the regiment formed part of the Glider Pilot and Parachute Corps. In 1957 the Glider Pilot Regiment and the Air Observation Post squadrons of the Royal Artillery amalgamated to form the current Army Air Corps.\n\nVeterans of the regiment were represented by the Glider Pilot Regimental Association. The association published a journal entitled \"The Eagle\", operated a benevolent fund and organised pilgrimages to locations where the regiment had fought, particularly Normandy and Arnhem. Due to the declining number of veterans and lack of external support, the members of the association voted in favour of winding it down. It closed on 31 December 2016.\n\nFamily members of veterans, who had previously been permitted to join the association as associate members, gathered together to form a civilian society named The Glider Pilot Regiment Society which officially opened on 1 January 2017 with the approval of a large number of veterans. The objective of the society is to preserve and promote the heritage of The Glider Pilot Regiment through education and engagement and create a network for veterans of the Glider Pilot Regiment and their families to engage with one another. The society produces a magazine entitled \"Glider Pilot's Notes\", arranges trips for veterans and organises events every year to mark key anniversaries relating to the regiment's history.\n\nThe regiment was awarded the following battle honours for its service during the Second World War:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1983069", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1983069", "title": "Doop (comics)", "text": "Doop (comics)\n\nDoop is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character appears in the Marvel Universe, created by writer Peter Milligan and artist Mike Allred. He made his debut in \"X-Force\" vol. 1 #116. He is a green, floating reniform creature of unknown origins who speaks in a \"language\" all his own (represented in text by a special font).\n\nDoop first appeared in \"X-Force\" vol. 1 #116, and appeared in every issue until the end of the series, and then appeared in all issues of \"X-Statix\". Doop also appeared alongside Wolverine in a two-issue limited series and had his own comic book mini series called \"All New Doop\".\n\nDoop was said to be the product of a Cold War era U.S. military experiment, becoming instrumental in the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\nHe later served as the cameraman for the celebrity mutant superhero team X-Statix (formerly known as X-Force). He films a mission to North Africa which is later criticized by then-team leader Zeitgeist; he feels Doop should not be going for artistic shots. The next X-Force mission is to New York, where they are to rescue the boy band \"Boyz R Us\" from hostage takers. While in the briefing room, U-Go Girl asks Doop not to keep shooting her rear from a low angle. Doop replies in his language only the characters know, while inexplicably mouthing some of his recording equipment.\n\nThe building is attacked by a helicopter gunship, killing the hostages and many of the terrorists. Most of the team dies also, with the exception of Doop, U-Go Girl and Anarchist. Doop gets high-quality images of the two slaying the remaining killers.\n\nPlush Doop dolls are seen on sale at the X-Statix cafe, for five dollars apiece. One of these is vandalized by Wolverine.\n\nAt one point, Doop secretly videotapes the rookie X-Statix member El Guapo succumbing to the temptations of fame and having a threesome. The released video destroys El Guapo's relationship with his original girlfriend.\n\nA section of X-Force headquarters is set aside for Doop's family, who are never seen in panel. This part is talked about very little by the team. The team hides in this area when they believed themselves to be in supernatural danger.\n\nIn a training/audition session for X-Statix, one of the applicants, Corkscrew, needlessly kills an opponent. It is discussed that Doop would take care of matters. Despite the seriousness of an innocent man having just died, Doop makes a joke in his language, which greatly entertains the team members present.\n\nDoop is sent on a camping trip with Corkscrew. At the end he simply kills Corkscrew with an axe, but not before subjecting the mentally unstable mutant to psychological torture. Part of this is tricking the man into killing wild horses.\n\nIn one incident, Doop's brain explodes, and parts of it land all across the world. X-Statix and Avengers fight each other to gain control of the brain pieces. Doop, running on a backup brain in his butt and now capable of human speech, joins in. He fights Thor to a standstill, sucking in his hammer Mjolnir and recreating multiple copies. Captain America states that Doop was an American-created super-weapon that was capable of destroying the entire planet. The Avengers, in the end, allow Doop back in to X-Statix custody, after they show courage and responsibility in facing the Asgardian threat of the \"Three Sisters\".\n\nHe is acquainted with Wolverine, and the two even teamed up in a two-issue miniseries.\n\nIt was revealed that at some indeterminate point in Doop's life, he had an affair with a beautiful married woman. Her husband hired a private investigator, Chandler, to spy on his errant wife. Chandler found himself falling in love with Doop. In the end, Doop ditched the woman to have an affair with the detective.\n\nAfter the incident with the Avengers, X-Statix holds a farewell party, attended by fans and multiple superheroes. They are hired for one last mission, ridding a billionaire's mansion of terrorists that have taken control of the building. Doop's teammate Anarchist notes that this resembles a mission in the past where all but two X-Force members die. Not only is the mansion full of gunmen, it is also surrounded by attack helicopters. The uniforms of the gunmen are identical to the ones that the 'Boyz R Us' hostage takers wore. During the mission everyone - Doop included - apparently perishes. Doop is seen sprawled in a chair with a large stomach wound.\n\nHowever, the vacationing X-Men Havok and Polaris encounter a Doop-like entity when it crashes to Earth from outer space. Polaris immediately identifies the creature as the same being she had previously seen in space and called it Daap. Havok eventually blasts it to pieces but it begins to reform itself. Its amorphous jelly-like remains then fly off with both Polaris and the mutant-hating Leper Queen. The true identity of Daap and any connection it has with Doop is left unrevealed.\n\nDoop returns in a story published in the \"Nation X\" anthology series, where he is brought onboard Utopia as a private investigator. The story is revealed to be nothing more than a dream, and that Doop is later shown living with a beautiful woman elsewhere. The first issue of \"Wolverine and the X-Men\" lists Doop as an adjunct member of the teaching staff at the Jean Grey Institute for Higher Learning. He is eventually shown substituting for Kitty Pryde's \"Introduction to Religion\" class, though, under Doop, the course largely consists of watching films while Doop takes naps. The students are shown to be comically unable to decipher Doop's lesson plan. Teaching, however, is a cover for Doop's real position. Wolverine alone knows that Doop is actually the secret protector of the school, spending most of his time gathering and acting upon information regarding possible threats to the students. He again protects the unwary students from a super-villain attack, post-graduation, using sonics.\n\nDoop makes a cameo in \"Young Avengers\" as the designated driver at the end of the Young Avengers' party. He is seen waiting with his arms crossed on the jet's loading ramp as Transonic carries an asleep Pixie on board.\n\nAfter semi-regular appearances in \"Wolverine and the X-Men\", Doop returned in April 2014 in his own 5-issue mini-series, \"All New Doop\", written by creator Peter Milligan, penciled by David Lafuente, with covers by Mike Allred.\n\nDoop's abilities displayed in the comics thus far have included superhuman strength and durability, flight, regeneration, physical malleability, a vaguely defined ability to manipulate time and/or space, and the ability to replicate physical objects by unknown means. In the \"silent\" issue of \"X-Force\", he accidentally sucked the entire team into his body or mind via a popped pimple. He entered himself by picking at the pimple, and rescued his teammates from their own subconscious minds. When they were restored to reality, none but Doop was aware of what had occurred, and only a fraction of a second had actually passed.\n\nDoop uses his mouth as a storage space for his camera equipment, among other items; it is unknown whether these items are simply stored inside his physical body or are actually transported to another dimension like the one to which his teammates were transported.\n\nIn the \"Lacuna\" storyline in \"X-Force\", Lacuna's ability to stop time does not affect Doop. Whatever his control over time or space may be, it is apparently not powerful enough for the team to use him for teleporting the group; they relied first on U-Go Girl and later on Venus Dee Milo for long-distance travel.\n\nIn the \"X-Statix vs. Avengers\" storyline in \"X-Statix\", Doop's brain was removed from his body and forced to project energy blasts at his teammates (a power that he did not demonstrate previously or afterwards). The brain was accidentally smashed into fragments by Thor, but his second brain (in his hindquarters) was temporarily installed in his head until the original brain could be reassembled, though it was stated that this second brain would only keep him alive for a short time. Later, when Thor struck Doop with his hammer, Mjolnir, Doop absorbed the hammer into his body and fired Mjolnir and a number of duplicate hammers from his mouth at Thor.\n\nDoop has stretched his facial features and tongue on numerous occasions, and once plucked an eye from his head and then replaced it. He expanded his body into a cushion in the \"Wolverine/Doop\" miniseries. It is unknown if Doop possesses any other powers. On the one instance where he was forced to kill someone, he apparently used an ordinary axe, although the killing itself was not actually depicted on-panel. Some time later, when Doop thought that Wolverine was dangerously insane, he was prepared to attack the X-Man with a broken glass bottle.\n\nIn 2001, several websites claimed to have deciphered Doopspeak. Series editor Axel Alonso responded in an October 8, 2001 article by Eric J. Moreels on the X-Fan site (now Comixfan) which was previously part of Cinescape.com:\n\nHowever, doopspeak was revealed in 2014, at the back of Essential X-Men issue 57.\n\nA figure of Doop was included with the Marvel Legends Series VI Deadpool figure.\n\nA Marvel Mini-Bust of DOOP by Bowen Designs was released in October 2004, as part of Phase II, Bust # 88 and sculpted by Randy Bowen.\n\nDoop merchandise is popular in the Marvel universe, particularly among children; Paco Perez was seen wearing a Doop T-shirt, while Molly Hayes is the known owner of both a stuffed Doop doll and Doop poster. Jean Grey has also been seen with a Doop keychain. All members of X-Statix were fully merchandised.\n\nDoop starred in his own action movie called 'Doop Hard'.\n\n\n\n"}

The books, \"Asha's Mums\", \"Belinda's Bouquet\" and \"One Dad, Two Dads, Brown Dad, Blue Dads\", each presented families where both parents were of the same sex. Chamberlain asserted that the books were necessary to reflect the realities of today's families and to teach his pupils about diversity and tolerance.

Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin dismissed the board's concerns that children would be confused or misled by classroom information about same-sex parents.

After graduating from the University of Lwów he was a teacher of mathematics and physics in high schools from 1910 until 1923, among others in Kraków. From 1924 until 1936 he was a professor at the Warsaw University of Technology and Warsaw University, from 1936 until 1960 in the Jagiellonian University. More about Leja in \n\nHe was captured by German Nazi during \"Senderaction Krakau\" and sent with 183 Polish professors of the Jagiellonian University and University of Technology to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. After international protest by prominent Italians including Benito Mussolini and the Vatican, 101 professors who were older than 40 were released from Sachsenhausen on February 8, 1940. Unfortunately Leja, older than 40, was not in the group of released prisoners. He stayed in a concentration camp until May 1940 when he returned to Kraków. In Kraków bad news were waiting for him: the university was closed, Leja's apartment was taken over by Nazi. The homeless couple with no income decided to move to Grodzisko Górne where they have a small house and garden. They got a permission from Gestapo and left Kraków. In Grodzisko Leja wrote the book on the calculus \"Rachunek różniczkowy i całkowy ze wstępem do równań różniczkowych\".\n\nSince 1948 he worked for the Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

{"id": "1983108", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1983108", "title": "Ian Beale", "text": "Ian Beale\n\nIan Beale is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera \"EastEnders\", played by Adam Woodyatt. He is the longest-serving character and the only remaining original character to have appeared continuously since the first episode on 19 February 1985. The character appeared in his 2000th episode in the show on 26 March 2007, and his 3000th on 27 May 2016. \n\nIan is the son of Pete (Peter Dean) and Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth), nephew of Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard) and cousin of Mark (David Scarboro/Todd Carty), Michelle Fowler (Sue Tully/Jenna Russell) and Martin Fowler (James Alexandrou/James Bye). He has fathered three children (Peter Beale, Lucy Beale and Bobby Beale), and acted as a father figure to Peter and Lucy's half-brother and half-sister, Steven Beale and Cindy Williams, respectively. Ian is also the most-married character in \"EastEnders\" history, with five marriages to four women (Cindy Williams, Mel Healy, Laura Dunn, and twice to Jane Collins) and two aborted engagements (to Mandy Salter and Denise Fox). As of 2020, Ian is also the current owner of 45 Albert Square, traditionally represented within the series as the family home of the Beale and Fowler family, and has also been on the show for 35 years. He took an extended break from the show in February 2019, but returned that June.\n\nAs a teenager, Ian argues with his father Pete Beale (Peter Dean) over his desire to become a caterer but his grandmother Lou Beale (Anna Wing) encourages him. He starts several businesses and buys a local café soon after graduating from catering college. Ian has several failed romances, including with his childhood friend, Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean). Sharon becomes interested in Simon Wicks (Nick Berry), who was believed to be Ian's half-brother, but they remain close friends. When his cousin Michelle falls pregnant, he is initially suspected to be the father by Pete and Kathy. He starts a relationship with Tina Hopkins (Eleanor Rhodes) and the pair decide to move in together, renting one of Kelvin Carpenter's (Paul J. Medford) father Tony Carpenter's (Oscar James) flats. Ian eventually loses his virginity to her, to his glee. Ian and Tina break up when Tina's parents make an unannounced visit and are unhappy with their living conditions, so they take Tina to Ilford. Ian's uncle Kenny Beale (Michael Attwell) and cousin Elizabeth Beale (Lucy Bayler) visit from New Zealand and Ian and Elizabeth taking a liking to each other, but they break up when Elizabeth constantly flirts with men and she returns home. Ian begins to develop a relationship with Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler), not knowing she is his half-sister until his mother Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth) tells him she was raped as a teenager and gave Donna up for adoption.\n\nIan gets engaged to Cindy Williams (Michelle Collins) in 1989; however, a one-night stand with Simon leaves her pregnant. Cindy marries Ian and claims that the baby she is expecting, Steven Beale, is his, resulting in Ian attempting suicide when he learns the truth. He recovers and causes Simon to have a car accident in revenge so Simon, Cindy and Steven leave Walford together. Ian immerses himself in his catering business but his exploitative working practices alienate his friends, employees and family. He and Cindy later reconcile and Ian is overjoyed to become a father to twins, Peter (Ben Hardy) and Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield/Hetti Bywater). After opening a fish and chip shop, Ian becomes so obsessed with building his business empire that he neglects Cindy, who decides to leave him for his half-brother, David Wicks (Michael French). Ian wins custody of their children, and makes Cindy so miserable that she hires John Valecue (Steve Weston), a hitman to kill him. Ian is shot but is only clipped by the bullet and recovers. Cindy leaves the country with Steven and Peter and spends a year in Italy before Ian traces them and retrieves the boys. Cindy returns to Walford and wins back custody of the children but is implicated in Ian's shooting. She is jailed on remand and dies several months later in prison during childbirth.\n\nIan has a serious romance with Mel Healy (Tamzin Outhwaite), the manager of his bric-a-brac shop. She proposes to him but later cheats on him with Steve Owen (Martin Kemp). Suspecting that she is planning to leave him, Ian manipulates her by falsely claiming that Lucy is dying from lymphoma. They marry in 1999, but she leaves him during their wedding reception after discovering that Lucy is fine. Ian then pursues a new business venture: development of high-market flats. He begins a casual relationship with his nanny, Laura Dunn (Hannah Waterman), but only commits to her after being declared bankrupt. Laura buys back the fish and chip shop and, despite fearing that Ian is only interested in an inheritance she has received, they marry in May 2001. Their marriage deteriorates when Ian attempts to kiss Mel. He refuses to have a child with Laura, who frequently belittles him. Steven learns that Ian has been visiting local prostitute Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks), and tells Laura, before moving to New Zealand to live with Simon. Laura forgives Ian on the condition that they have a baby. Although he agrees, Ian has a secret vasectomy and throws Laura out when she becomes pregnant later that year after conning her into signing over control of their businesses.\n\nLaura's son Bobby (Kevin Curran) requires a blood transfusion shortly after his birth, making Laura realise that Ian must be his father, as her lover Garry Hobbs (Ricky Groves) is not a match. Laura dies in 2004, breaking her neck after falling down the stairs. Ian takes custody of Bobby and also takes in his half-brother Ben Mitchell, following the death of their mother. Ian fights Ben's father Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) for custody, worsening their long-standing enmity which stems from Phil's disastrous marriage to Ian's mother Kathy. Ian meets a new romantic interest, Jane Collins (Laurie Brett), in 2004. He helps her to come to terms with the death of her husband, David Collins (Dan Milne) from Huntington's disease, and, although their relationship is severely tested when Jane has a brief affair with Phil's brother, Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp), they marry in July 2007. Steven returns to Walford and stalks Ian, escalating to holding him hostage for several weeks. He accidentally shoots Jane during an altercation, which results in her needing a hysterectomy. Ian forgives Steven but banishes him from his life when he helps Lucy run away. Ian and Jane temporarily separate over Ian's reluctance to adopt a child. When Lucy falls pregnant, she suggests that Jane raise the baby as her own. Jane and Ian agree but he secretly helps Lucy to have an abortion, lying to Jane that she miscarried. Jane later learns the truth and decides to steal Ian's money and leave him. Ian arranges for her to adopt Bobby, and is devastated to discover Jane's plans. Although she decides to remain with him, Ian begins an affair with Glenda Mitchell (Glynis Barber), who later blackmails Ian, forcing him to confess the adultery to Jane. A disgusted Peter leaves Walford and joins Lucy in Devon. Jane and Ian divorce but continue to live together; however, their acrimony upsets Bobby and Jane leaves Walford in May 2011 as a result. Ian attempts to move on by filling an urn with cigarette ash, pretending that he is a widower and that the ashes are Jane in order to gain attention from women. However, his ruse is soon uncovered.\n\nFeeling dejected, Ian goes to a strip club in August 2011 and is stunned to see Mandy Salter (Nicola Stapleton) being thrown out. Ian helps Mandy out and allows her to stay with him. Mandy helps Ian discover his more frivolous side and he realises he has feelings for her. They begin a relationship, realising that they both yearn for someone to love them, and Mandy accepts Ian's impromptu marriage proposal. Following the death of relative Pat Evans (Pam St Clement), Ian's daughter Lucy returns to Walford, angry at Ian for not telling her about Pat's death. She decides to move in with her father and takes a disliking to Mandy. The relationship is marred by Mandy's one-night stand with Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen), Ian's insecurities, interference from Mandy's abusive mother Lorraine Stevens (Victoria Alcock), and Lucy's hatred of Mandy. Despite Lucy's best efforts to split them up, Ian is determined to marry Mandy and brings their wedding day forward. Mandy is horrified, however, when Ian chooses her over Lucy and throws his daughter out. Realising she does not love Ian, Mandy leaves him in May 2012, leading to Ian suffering a nervous breakdown. He wanders along a road barefoot, dressed only in pyjamas, not telling anyone where he has gone.\n\nTwo months later, Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa), working with homeless people, sees Ian at a tramp shelter. Tanya Cross (Jo Joyner), Max Branning (Jake Wood) and Alfie Moon (Shane Richie) find him and bring him back to the Square but Lucy is unsympathetic, angered by his leaving her and Bobby, and slams the door in his face. Ian refuses to acknowledge anyone. He stays with Tanya and Max until Phil finds out he is back and takes him to his house to ensure he does not tell anybody about Ben murdering Heather. Ian continues to be unresponsive until Phil's partner Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) mentions Heather, and his memory returns. Ben attempts to help Ian by taking him to the café, but Lucy screams and has him physically removed. Ian, extremely miserable, collapses in tears outside, while Phil worries that Ian will remember that Ben murdered Heather. After Sharon returns to Walford, she successfully persuades Lucy to give Ian another chance. Lucy agrees but on the condition that Ian signs all of his businesses over to her so that if Ian abandons her again she can be financially secure. Ian agrees to this. Ben confesses to murdering Heather and is remanded in custody, leaving Ian shocked. He starts working again at the café and getting back into his old life. Phil then gets Ian to visit Ben in prison to try to get him to retract his confession, but Ian says he cannot tell Ben what is right. Eventually, Zainab Khan (Nina Wadia) persuades Ian to attend counselling in an attempt to recover from his mental breakdown and, after talking to Sharon, Lucy finally makes peace with her father.\n\nIan sparks a friendly rivalry with Denise Fox (Diane Parish) as the two engage in a fruit-selling war, though he irritates her. Denise's sister, Kim Fox (Tameka Empson), attempts to set them up on a date but this upsets Denise, who kisses Kim's boyfriend Ray Dixon (Chucky Venn). Kim discovers this and disowns her sister, so Ian allows Denise to stay with him, igniting a friendship between them. It eventually leads to a relationship when he confides in her about his life on the streets. Ian decides to open a restaurant, though Lucy is worried it will fail because of his mental illness. He runs out of money for construction but then finds a box of cash that used to belong to Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman). He also gets Janine to invest in the restaurant, and eventually tricks Lucy into signing over all of the businesses to him. Peter (now played by Ben Hardy) returns to live with the family, and is soon followed by Cindy Williams (Mimi Keene), the daughter of Ian's dead ex-wife of the same name. Ian lets Cindy stay, and Denise also moves in with the family. However Carl White (Daniel Coonan), an associate of Derek, arrives in Walford and soon works out that Ian has spent Derek's money. Carl claims the money was his, and so extorts large sums of cash from Ian as payback. Carl is violent, and burns Ian's hand when he tries to refuse to pay him before promising that the debt will be paid if Ian lies in court, and says that he saw Max tampering with the brakes of Carl's car. Ian reluctantly agrees, but on the day of the court case he is kidnapped by Phil, and Max is found not guilty. It is then revealed that Max was in on the kidnapping, but it was just to lure Carl into a trap. Ian then has to face the consequences of his actions, and Denise is angry when she finds out the truth.\n\nDenise thinks that Ian is planning to propose to her as a Christmas present, but he denies it even though he has bought an engagement ring. Peter reveals that he is in a relationship with Lola Pearce (Danielle Harold), the mother of Phil's granddaughter and Ian's niece, Lexi Pearce. Phil threatens Ian and forces him to end the relationship. Ian tells Peter this, and Peter tells Ian that he has found £10,000 that Cindy stole from Phil. They return the money, and Phil blames Ian, believing that he put Cindy up to stealing it. In January 2014, just as Ian is about to propose to Denise, Jane arrives unannounced. Jane later buys into Ian's restaurant and they begin running it together, leading Ian to harbour feelings for Jane.\n\nIan is pessimistic when Lucy decides to set up her own property business and later becomes concerned about her when he discovers she is sleeping with Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard) and is taking cocaine. He confronts her and admits she is the child he is most proud of, but this is overheard by Peter, resulting in Lucy storming out. Ian tries to contact her when she does not return home that night, but is later informed by DC Emma Summerhayes (Anna Acton) and DS Cameron Bryant (Glen Wallace) that Lucy has been found dead. He identifies her body and then shares his devastating news with Jane, Denise, Cindy, Bobby and finally Peter. Struggling with their grief, Ian and Jane share a passionate encounter, giving Ian hope that they might reunite. When Jane dashes his hopes, Ian takes his anger out on Bobby and Jane decides it would be best if she take Bobby away for a while. Cindy also leaves the Square to return to Devon with her aunt, Gina Williams. Increasingly alone, Ian leans on Phil for support and questions how he can move on from his daughter's death. With Peter's help, he stages an opening for the new and improved restaurant, but during opening night Summerhayes reveals that Lucy's body has been released for burial. Ian leaves early with Peter to see her, but is unable due to his grief. He wants to organise the funeral for as soon as possible but discovers that Max and Lucy were together; Ian angrily attacks Max as he carries Lucy's coffin down the aisle of the church and it is clear that Ian is not coping. Worried, Sharon believes that he is relying on pills to numb the pain of his grief and she and Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson) comfort him.\n\nIan receives texts from Rainie Cross (Tanya Franks) that he hides them from Denise. It is later discovered that he paid Rainie for sex on the night Lucy died, and, knowing that he has given a false alibi to the police, Rainie demands money to fund her drug addiction. When Ian cannot pay Rainie, she comes to Walford and tells Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker) what Ian did. Patrick confronts Ian and decides to tell Denise so Ian arranges a surprise trip to see Denise's daughter Libby Fox (Belinda Owusu) in Oxford, and they leave before Patrick can tell Denise. Patrick suffers a stroke and he is unable to communicate what happened to Denise. Ian meets Rainie at her request but Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) sees them together. When Ian drives away, Rainie approaches Mick who is then arrested and charged for soliciting.\n\nIan tries to convince Denise to put Patrick in a care home, fearful of his secret. However, he eventually agrees that Patrick can live with them. Rainie tells Denise the truth, but before Ian can explain to Denise, Cindy makes a sudden return, already several hours into her labour. Ian delivers her baby daughter, and agrees that she can live with him. Denise moves out, refusing to forgive Ian for his actions when she discovers that Patrick knew and that Ian was willing to put Patrick in a care home to keep his secret. Concerned for Ian, Sharon and Phil organise for him to visit Michelle in America. Ian returns on Sharon's wedding day to try to stop her marrying Phil. Jane returns with the news that Bobby is missinghe is found on Walford Commonhe wants to return to Walford and Jane agrees. She falls for Ian again and proposes to him at the Christmas Eve carol concert. They plan their wedding for next February.\n\nIan and Jane get married in the restaurant with their friends and family as witnesses. After Lauren tells Peter that she believes Lucy was murdered by a member of the family, he accuses them of killing Lucy. Jane admits that Bobby accidentally killed Lucy by hitting her over the head with a jewellery box. Though Bobby believed that Lucy was still alive, Jane realized she was dead and covered up her murder by faking a mugging. Ian, Jane and Cindy decide to cover up Lucy's murder however Peter does not agree to do this. Ian, Jane, Bobby and Beth go on holiday for Ian and Jane's honeymoon, and Peter leaves Walford along with Lauren. A few weeks later, Ian and the rest of the Beales return to Walford and reunite Beth with Cindy, but Cindy believes that she is not a capable mother and abandons Beth at the park, but she is picked up by Ian's great nephew Liam Butcher (James Forde). Ian and Jane agree to adopt Beth, but Cindy decides she does not want to be in the same house as her baby, so says that if she is not adopted into a different household, she will tell everyone Bobby killed Lucy. After Beth is taken in by her paternal relatives, Ian tells Cindy to leave and not come back. Jane pays Carol to look after Cindy and Ian finds out from Carol after an argument with her. On the day of Cindy's school prom, Ian reveals this to Cindy. After Cindy gets into a car with two strange men, feeling she has no home, a concerned Ian phones the police. After Cindy returns, Ian tries to convince her she is wanted and Liam convinces her to give her family a chance, so she and Ian make up. Ian and Jane are upset to learn about a new lead in the murder investigation but they still plan silence even after Ben is arrested in the hope that he is released. However, when Max is arrested and charged for the murder, Jane begins to contemplate telling the truth when she feels guilty for not being able to help Carol prove Max's innocence. Ian is adamant that Bobby's role in the murder will not be made public and confronts Sharon when she discovers the truth. Max is found guilty and sentenced to 21 years in prison.\n\nIan puts Bobby in a private school, hoping that it will help with his anger problems. However, to pay for it, Ian decides to sell his restaurant to a supermarket chain, causing the locals to protest. Ian eventually decides not to sell, meaning Bobby must leave the school, even though he is happy there and doing well. Bobby overhears Jane talking about Bobby leaving the school and when she stops him going back to the school, he hits her over the head with his hockey stick three times, leaving her in a critical condition. He tells Ian in the pub that he has killed Jane, just like he killed Lucy, within earshot of everyone in the pub. After Bobby is questioned about the assault, he confesses to the police that he killed Lucy. They are reluctant to reopen the case but Ian is horrified when Bobby says he still has the murder weapon.\n\nBobby is charged with unlawful killing and denied bail. He is sent to a youth detention centre until his next hearing the following week. Ian then goes to see Jane in hospital, where she tells him she knows about Steven returning and the Beale family is better off without her, ending her and Ian's relationship. Bobby is sentenced to three years custody. A week later, after visiting Bobby in prison and telling him not to appeal his sentence, Ian receives a threatening note from Max, saying that he will never forget what Ian did. Ian worries when Max returns, but Max tells him and Jane that he has forgiven them. Ian is thrilled when Michelle returns. He starts to worry about his health when he has a medical checkup and he is told that his BMI is high. Michelle crashes her car into Ian's fish and chip shop, for which he has no buildings insurance. Max's employer eventually purchases the chip shop, despite it arousing Ian's suspicions.\n\nIan and Jane are devastated to hear that Steven has a brain tumour, but he has been lying about this in a desperate attempt to stay with Lauren. Jane discovers Steven's lie and that Max has not really forgiven them and is secretly planning revenge. In a bid to get rid of Jane, Max forces Steven to kill her. As a result, Steven sets fire to the restaurant, trapping Jane inside. Steven tries to save Jane, but is violently shoved into a table by Max, who leaves Jane to die. However, while Jane is rescued, Steven dies from a liver bleed. Ian, Kathy and Lauren are shocked when they learn that Steven did not really have a brain tumour. After Jane comes out of her coma, Max forces her to leave Walford with Ian, but James Willmott-Brown (William Boyde), who is working with Max, orders Max to ensure that Ian remains in Walford, so Max blackmails Jane into leaving Walford alone. Ian allows Lauren and Louie to move back in with him and tells Lauren's sister, Abi Branning's (Lorna Fitzgerald), about making Beales into a franchise to pass onto Louie, so Abi tells him that she is pregnant with Steven's baby, but Ian does not take the news well. Later, Lauren warns Ian to watch his back as Max may be out for revenge, and a broken Max visits Ian and says he will kill him and Phil for making him suffer in prison. Ian tries to escape but Max attempts to strangle Ian with fairy lights as Lauren and Louie come home. On Christmas Day, Tanya returns to Walford and reveals to Stacey and Abi that Jane told her that Max killed Steven, news which Abi relays to Lauren, Kathy and Ian. Ian attacks Max in the street but Max overpowers and punches him.\n\nIn February 2020, Ian discovers that Sharon's teenage son, Dennis Rickman (Bleu Landau), has been bullying Bobby for his faith, which results in Bobby being hospitalised following an Islamophobic attack. Enraged, Ian confronts Dennis during The Queen Vic boat party and angrily locks him in a cabin following a bitter row. However, when Phil and Keanu's fight leads the boat to crash, Ian instantly goes to rescue Dennis; despite Ian’s best efforts, Dennis dies and Ian is left feeling guilty. Nick's daughter Dotty Cotton (Milly Zero) knows Ian imprisoned Denny and blackmails Ian to get her the Arches, although she changes her mind at the funeral, at a family meal, she tries to persuade Ian to be brave enough to confess.\n\nIan Beale is one of the original twenty-three characters written by the creators of \"EastEnders\", Tony Holland and Julia Smith. Ian is a member of the first family of \"EastEnders\", the Beales and Fowlers, and Holland took the inspiration for some of the series' earliest characters from his own London family and background. Ian's original character outline as written by Smith and Holland appeared in an abridged form in their book, \"EastEnders: The Inside Story\".\n\nBecause the actress playing Ian's mother Kathy (Gillian Taylforth) was fair-haired, they also wanted him to be fair, and because of Taylforth's age he also had to look very young. Ian was meant to be 14 years old when the programme first aired, but because of licensing regulations, the actor cast was required to be a 16-year-old who could \"play down\". Adam Woodyatt, born in East London, had worked as an actor in his youth, but had given it up and relocated with his family to Wales. He was recruited from his old agency and it was decided that he was perfect for the part and he was subsequently cast as Ian Beale. In 1990 Ian's age was increased and he celebrated his twenty-first birthday two years after his eighteenth. The producers felt Ian needed to be a bit older and more mature for storylines planned for him later that year.\n\nIan Beale has gone on to be the longest running character in the soap's history. Woodyatt confirmed his desire to remain with the show in 2010, during the show's 25th anniversary: \"Why would I want to leave when I'm not going to get the chance to portray even half the range of emotions I get to here in a one-off drama or a six-part series? And you're not going to get the same viewing figures either. You have your moments when things go wrong and you perhaps don't want to work with a certain person. In any office there are going to be people who don't get along but you get on with it and on the whole I enjoy it. Over the last couple of years we've had a really tight crew and it's the best atmosphere I can remember. There have been peaks and troughs, like with any show, but right now things are good.\"\n\nIan has been described as a character viewers love to hate. His initial storylines portrayed him as a sensitive young boy with professional aspirations that went against his father's wishes. Not content to follow in his father's footsteps and take over the family fruit and veg stall, Ian wanted to become a chef and this caused a certain amount of hostility between him and his father, who viewed the occupation as effeminate. Ian's keenness to succeed in his business ventures continued as the character grew, so much so that he started using underhand methods in order to get what he wanted and became one of the soap's most renowned \"slimeballs\". The character is regularly referred to as a \"weasel\" in the British press.\nAuthor Dorothy Hobson has described Ian as a typical Thatcher's child, a term used to reference children who grew up under the Conservative government of the 1980s and who adopted an ideology, such as personal financial gain, self-sufficiency and disregard of the welfare of those who are less well-off. As a result, Hobson suggests that Ian is \"young, ambitious, rich and unhappy\", which she claims is a perfect reflection of the spirit of the age.\n\nIn her book, \"Who's Who?\", Kate Lock described Ian as \"wimpy, perhaps not what you'd call a man's man [...] trying to turn Walford into the capital of Capitalism [...] Somewhere along the line, Ian evolved into an obsessive, obnoxious money-monster [...] Ian always pretended to be magnanimous, doing things for the community [...] but it's inspired by self-interest.\"\n\nHobson suggests that Ian's saving grace is that he is a \"passionately caring father\" and Woodyatt has suggested that Ian is a chameleon, a description he claims former Executive Producer Louise Berridge used to describe the character. Woodyatt commented in 2010, \"Whatever [Louise Berridge] wanted Ian to do, she'd find a way of justifying it. It's true. He can be nice to his family but he can be devious with them as well. He can stitch people up but can be very generous. You can get away with doing anything with Ian. It's probably why I'm still here.\"\n\nObsession with success has been an underlying theme with the character for almost the entire duration of the show, but the acceleration of Ian's nasty side can be traced back to his disastrous first marriage to one of \"EastEnder\"s' most renowned women, Cindy Beale in 1989. The storyline centred on Ian's discovery that the child he thought was his (Steven), was actually his best friend's. The climax of this revelation was known to script-writers as the \"Devon cottage climax\" and aired in September 1990. The episode saw an enraged Ian trace Cindy and Simon Wicks to her parents' house in Devon, just after being released from hospital following a failed suicide bid. The script, written by Debbie Cook, led to a confrontation that \"EastEnder\"s' writer Colin Brake has suggested contained elements of tragedy and farce. Brake suggests that a particularly memorable scene included Ian furiously throwing bricks through the window of the house, followed by one of his crutches. The episode ended ominously with Ian finding Cindy's father's shotgun and stealing it. Directed by Matthew Evans, Brake suggests that these episodes not only brought the story to a shocking climax but also laid roots for the next three months' worth of storylines, building up to Cindy and Simon's departure, and Ian's spectacular fall from grace.\n\nAuthor Dorothy Hobson has described Ian and Cindy's relationship as \"one of the most tempestuous in any soap opera\". The characters were reunited on-screen in 1992 but the relationship ended in adultery once again when Cindy began an affair with Simon's brother David Wicks, which culminated in Cindy hiring an assassin to shoot Ian in 1996 after he discovered the affair. Michelle Collins who played Cindy commented in 1996, \"[Cindy] was not thinking properly when she contacted the hitman, and she is being quite erratic. Despite what she has done she never expected Ian to be so cruel to her. Now she cannot really see any other way out of the mess she is in. She has lost touch with reality – but in the end she can't see any other way of escaping Ian.\" More than 18 million viewers tuned in to see Ian gunned-down, which was more than sixty-four per cent of available viewers. The plot facilitated Collins' desire to leave the programme following the birth of her child, and Cindy, implicated in the shooting, fled the country with Ian's two sons.\n\nIan was voted one of the top five television characters \"we most love to hate\" in a Channel 4 poll in 2001. In 2009, Ian Beale came ninth in a poll by British men's magazine \"Loaded\" for \"Top Soap Bloke\". Woodyatt has received a number of award nominations for his portrayal of Ian, including a \"Best Actor\" nomination at The British Soap Awards 2010 and a nomination for \"Best Performance in a Serial Drama\" in The National Television Awards 2012. In 2013, Woodyatt received a \"Lifetime Achievement Award\" at The British Soap Awards. Following thirty years of service to \"EastEnders\", Woodyatt was awarded with his first \"Best Actor\" accolade at The British Soap Awards 2015. At this ceremony, he also won \"Best On-screen Partnership\" alongside Laurie Brett.\n\nAuthor Dorothy Hobson has stated that Ian Beale is a \"major creation\" capturing the personification of political attitudes taken up during the Conservative government of the 1980s. She suggests that Ian Beale is a \"major representation of a young man\" of that era, and that his sensitive portrayal by Adam Woodyatt is \"perhaps unrecognised\". Roz Paterson of the \"Daily Record\" branded Ian \"eminently unlovable\" and stated that Melanie proposing to him represented a growing trend in women proposing. Holy Soap said that Ian's most memorable moment was \"His attempted murder in the Square\". In 2009, Virgin Media called Ian \"the most boring and selfish man in Walford\" and felt that he deserved to lose his wife, Jane.\n\n"}

It was named after Arkia Airlines founder Yakov Hozman (Jacob Housman) and is located in the center of Eilat adjacent to Route 90 (The Arava Road). Due to its short runway and limited capacity it mainly handled domestic flights from Tel Aviv and Haifa Airports, while Uvda International Airport, located some 60 km north of the city handled Eilat’s international carriers.\n\nThe airport was expected to cease operations on October 27, 2018 with the opening of the new Ramon Airport However, the opening of the new airport was delayed until January 21, 2019.\n\nFollowing the inauguration of Ramon airport located approximately 20 km north of the city, Eilat Airport ceased operations on 18 March 2019. The new, larger airport now handles all of Eilat’s domestic and international flights.\n\nEilat Airport was established in 1949 by the Israel Air Force, following the 1947–1949 Palestine war. During its early years, the airport aimed to establish a comprehensive set of connections to towns across the country, most notably with Tel Aviv and Haifa. Consequently, a regular route from Eilat to Lod Airport (now Ben Gurion International Airport) was started. Soon after, a route to Haifa Airport became operational. In December 1950, following their establishment, Arkia Israel Airlines became the largest domestic operator at Eilat Airport, taking the position of the former companies Eilata and Aviron. To this day, they retain this position. Later, in 1964 the runway was expanded to 1500 m, and a passenger terminal was built. Five years later, the runway was further expanded increasing the length to 1900 m. In 1975, Eilat Airport started to attract Scandinavian airlines. The first international flight arrival to Eilat, of the Danish airline, Sterling Airlines landed in this year. Since then, many international routes have been established directly linking Eilat with Europe, however, the airport is still unable to handle landings of large aircraft which have to fly to Uvda International Airport.\n\nIn the 1994 Peace Agreement between Israel and Jordan it was decided that operations were supposed to be transferred from Eilat Airport to Aqaba Airport. The original plan was to rename Aqaba Airport as \"Aqaba-Eilat Peace International Airport\". The agreement was never followed, however, and an agreement between the two countries in March 1997, stipulated that domestic flights would continue to use Eilat Airport, whilst no further action to move international flights took place.\n\nIn August 2005, a Katyusha rocket fired from Jordan landed near a taxi traveling just from the airport perimeter fence. On August 8, 2013, the Israeli Military instructed the airport to cancel all landings and departures after a security assessment. Militants in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula had fired rockets towards the city in recent years, but it was not immediately clear if that was the reason for the closure.\n\nDuring its latest period of service, Eilat Airport sustained peak loads concentrated into Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays. On Thursdays and Sundays, flights were handled in a period of a few hours in the mornings and on Saturdays only the evening hours were used. Often there were days when 10,000 passengers on 120 flights were channeled through the 2,800 m terminal, which counted as one of the highest peak loads worldwide in this category.\n\nInternational passenger traffic decreased from magnitude of 20,000 a year in late 2000s to 5,000 a year in 2010s. Most international traffic to Eilat was handled by Ovda Airport instead, while Eilat Airport handled about 1.5 million domestic passengers per year. A little more than half of them flew to or from Sde Dov Airport in Tel Aviv (which itself was closed several months after the closing of Eilat Airport), while the rest flew mostly to Ben Gurion Airport, with smaller numbers to Haifa Airport.\n\nAlthough the airport was capable of handling Boeing 767 aircraft, for large numbers of these aircraft, significant investment would have been needed. Consequently, the largest aircraft that regularly flew to the airport were Boeing 757. The main problem at the airport was the lack of ramp space, with just two parking positions for large aircraft. As a result, El Al operated regular shuttle flights to Ben Gurion International Airport carrying passengers from around the world on 757s and 737s.\n\nThe small size of the airport is perhaps best illustrated with the fact that a Boeing 757 could not taxi past another aircraft to parking positions. As a result, controllers were responsible not only for ensuring that valuable space is utilised, but also for ensuring that other aircraft were kept circling until larger aircraft were parked. Despite these limitations, the airport successfully handled ten to twenty times more traffic than airports of a comparable size. It is for this reason that plans to relocate the airport were so important in the short-term scale. In 2006, a NIS 5.5 million renovation programme of Eilat Airport's terminal and runway was undertaken, designed to sustain the airport until it was replaced.\n\nSince the beginning of the 1990s the authorities in Eilat have considered relocating the airport out of the city boundaries. There were numerous reasons behind this idea. Primarily, the fact that safety would be improved as in its current location, there is the chance of aircraft crashing into buildings in the city. Other reasons were the pure value of the land which the airport occupies, and the fact that the airport is dividing the city of Eilat into two parts with the hotels and tourist areas on one side, and the residential buildings on the other.\n\nOn 24 July 2011 the Israeli cabinet approved the construction of a new airport in Timna Valley, north of Eilat, next to Be'er Ora. Ramon Airport opened in 2019, named in memory of the first Israeli astronaut Ilan Ramon (who died in 2003) and his son Assaf Ramon (who died in 2009 when his F-16 fighter jet crashed over the West Bank). It has a runway, longer than the runway in Eilat, which allows large aircraft to land.\n\nFollowing the inauguration of Ramon Airport, Eilat Airport ceased all operations on March 18, 2019. Its land, which is located in the heart of the city, is expected to be used for real estate development.\n\n"}

The French author from the 17th century Louis Moréri indicates that the settlement was founded by Jews expelled from Paris. This idea, however, remains speculative: available medieval Christian and Jewish sources do not mention the existence of the Jewish community in this place. For this reason, the exact role of Jews in the inception or the development of this town remains obscure. During the 20th century, certain authors suggested other etymological explanations that are, nevertheless, even more speculative and, moreover, do not explain the known Latin and medieval French spellings.\n\nVillejuif is served by three stations on Paris Métro Line 7: Villejuif – Léo Lagrange, Villejuif – Paul Vaillant-Couturier, and Villejuif – Louis Aragon.\n\n\nVillejuif has several hospitals on its territory :\n\n13 preschools, 11 elementary schools, and five junior high schools (Collège Aimé-Césaire, Collège Guy-Môquet, Collège Jean Lurçat, Collège Karl Marx, Collège Pasteur) are in Villejuif.

The community area covers the village and harbour, and several smaller, dispersed settlements. It includes six scheduled Iron Age hut groups and many other sites of archaeological interest. The harbour was formerly a local fishing port; a lifeboat station has been based here since 1854. Among many shipwrecks off the coast was that of the Royal Charter in 1859. Near the modernised lifeboat station is the RNLI Seawatch Centre. The coastline includes a rocky headland north of the village and a large sandy beach at Lligwy Bay, both traversed by the Anglesey Coastal Path. The 2011 census measured the village population as 710.\n\nThe village of Moelfre wraps around a small harbour sheltered from the north by a substantial headland and the rocky island of Ynys Moelfre. Also within Moelfre Community are the more dispersed settlements of Marian-glas, Llanallgo, Brynrefail and Mynydd Bodafon. It had a population of 1,064 at the time of the 2011 UK census. The village today has 502 households and 5 per cent unemployment. The Royal Mail postcode begins LL72. The main road through the community is the A5025, which is a five-minute drive from the village. The nearest mainline railway stations are in Bangor and Llanfairpwllgwyngyll. These can be reached in under half an hour by bus services which run through the village.\n\nThe meaning of the Welsh name is \"bald\" or \"barren hill\", which refers to the land behind the village, as seen from the sea. The name has the same origin as that of the Malvern Hills.\n\nThe Community of Moelfre has 14 Scheduled Ancient Monuments, which is more than any other in Anglesey. The majority are prehistoric and include a neolithic burial site and a standing stone. However six of them are Iron Age settlements, suggesting a well-settled landscape by the time the Romans arrived. Three of the monuments (denoted in the table by ) are in the care of Cadw. These are signposted from the road, have public access and explanation boards at the site. Other scheduled monuments may or may not be visible from roads or footpaths, and have no automatic right of access.\n\nThe headland north of Moelfre was the site of the wreck in 1859 of the steam clipper \"The Royal Charter\" near the end of its voyage from Australia to Liverpool. A memorial on the headland and an obelisk in Llanallgo Churchyard commemorate the 400 lives lost. On July 30, 1862, the screw sloop \"Enrica\", soon to be commissioned as the Confederate States of America warship \"CSS Alabama\", sheltered in Moelfre Bay while evading both British customs authorities and the \"USS Tuscarora\", which had been sent to capture or sink her.\n\nThe difficulties posed to sailing ships by the east-facing shore and limited seaway resulted in many ships being wrecked off the Moelfre coast. As well as the \"Royal Charter\", there is the wreck of the \"Princess Amelia\" (1868) on Lligwy beach, and the \"Kate\" caught fire off Moelfre harbour in 1933. Many ships, like the \"Royal Charter\" and, 100 years later, the \"Hindlea II\", ended up driven by autumn or spring gales onto the shore. On the 500m of coast south of Moelfre there are the wrecks of the \"Brothers\" (1826), the \"Sarah Davison\" (1881), the \"Riviera\" (1892), the \"Dart\" (1888), the \"Alexandrina\" (1890), the \"Margaret Elizabeth\" (1906), the \"Dinas\" (1907), the \"Jewess\" (1910) and the \"William Henry\" (1915).\n\nThe maritime historian Aled Eames (1921–1996) lived in the village for a long period.\n\nMoelfre RNLI Lifeboat Station has a distinguished history, including the \"Hindlea\" rescue in 1959, when all the crew were rescued. There has been a lifeboat in Moelfre since 1854. The lifeboat station is open to the public for most of the year, and houses the Tamar-class lifeboat \"Kiwi\" and the inshore inflatable D-class lifeboat (IB1) \"Enfys\".\n\nActress Jennifer Ellison was rescued in August 2013 off Moelfre.\n\nA statue of Richard Evans, lifeboatman, was unveiled in 2004 by Prince Charles, outside the Seawatch Museum, which is close to the lifeboat station. It presents information relating to the area and the history of the lifeboats associated with Moelfre.\n\nThis area is by the large sandy beach Traeth Lligwy and the ancient stone homestead of Din Lligwy. Nearby Ynys Moelfre is a haven for birds, and seals and porpoises may also be seen. There are more details on the village website.\n\nSt Galgo's Anglican Church dates back to the 7th century. Carmel Congregational Chapel was built in 1829. Both have weekly services in Welsh and English. Paradws Chapel is Calvinistic Methodist.\n\nThe village has a school with a hall that can be used for public events. Ysgol Gymuned Moelfre (Community School) teaches in Welsh. There were 63 pupils at all levels in 2013. The local library is in the same building. The village also has a football club, CPD Bro Goronwy, based in School Lane.\n\nThere were no street lights in the village until well after the Second World War, when they were installed as a memorial to the village's war dead.\n\nIn the village there are restaurants, a bakery, and a fish and chip shop. The RNLI Gwylfan Moelfre Seawatch Centre has a small museum, shop and book store.\n\n"}

For instance, \"being taller than\" is a relation that is true of \"Shaquille O'Neal and Ross Perot\" and false of \"the Empire State building and Mt. Everest.\" Substances or things have properties (\"this spot is red\"). Relations on the other hand obtain between two substances (\"this spot is bigger than that spot\") or two properties (\"this red is a darker shade than that red\"). \n\nThere are two major kinds of relations: ontological and epistemological. Ontological relations are entities like \"father\", which is a person considered in his relation \"to\" a child. Epistemological relations are often logical connections that obtain between two concepts or ideas, like \"entailment.\" The fact that all men are mortal and that Socrates is a man entails that Socrates is mortal—the relation between Socrates' mortality and the mortality of all men is an entailment relation. \n\nRelation of Ideas, in the Humean sense, is the type of knowledge that can be characterized as arising out of pure conceptual thought and logical operations (in contrast to a Matter of Fact). For instance, in mathematics: 8 x 10 = 80. Or in Logic: All islands are surrounded by water (by definition).\n\nIn Kantian philosophy, a relation is equivalent to the analytic \"a priori\". Unlike Hume, Kant denied, in the introduction to his \"Critique of Pure Reason\", that mathematical truths were analytic. Rather, 'a bachelor is unmarried' is true by relation of the definitions of the concepts of 'bachelor' and 'unmarried.'\n\nIn Leibniz, relations of ideas are also similar to the so-called Truths of Reason, which are defined as those statements whose denials are self-contradictory.\n"}
{"id": "1983173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1983173", "title": "Siegbahn notation", "text": "Siegbahn notation\n\nThe Siegbahn notation is used in X-ray spectroscopy to name the spectral lines that are characteristic to elements. It was introduced by Manne Siegbahn.\n\nThe characteristic lines in X-ray emission spectra correspond to atomic electronic transitions where an electron jumps down to a vacancy in one of the inner shells of an atom. Such a hole in an inner shell may have been produced by bombardment with electrons in an X-ray tube, by other particles as in PIXE, by other X-rays in X-ray fluorescence or by radioactive decay of the atom's nucleus.\n\nAlthough still widely used in spectroscopy, this notation is unsystematic and often confusing. For these reasons, International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) recommends another newer nomenclature. The table below shows a few of the common electronic levels with their names in Siegbahn and IUPAC notation.\n\nThe use of the letters K and L to denote X-rays originates in a 1911 paper by Charles Glover Barkla, titled \"The Spectra of the Fluorescent Röntgen Radiations\". (\"Röntgen radiation\" is an archaic name for \"x-rays\") By 1913, Henry Moseley had clearly differentiated two types of x-ray lines for each element, naming them α and β. In 1914, as part of his thesis, Ivar Malmer (), a student of Manne Siegbahn, discovered that the α and β lines were not single lines, but doublets. In 1916, Siegbahn published this result in the journal Nature, using what would come to be known as the Siegbahn notation.\n\nK-alpha emission lines result when an electron transitions to the innermost \"K\" shell (principal quantum number 1) from a 2p orbital of the second or \"L\" shell (with principal quantum number 2). The line is actually a doublet, with slightly different energies depending on spin–orbit interaction energy between the electron spin and the orbital momentum of the 2p orbital. K-alpha is typically by far the strongest X-ray spectral line for an element bombarded with energy sufficient to cause maximally intense X-ray emission.\n\nK-alpha emission is composed of two spectral lines, K-alpha and K-alpha (see figure to the right). The K-alpha emission is higher in energy and thus has a lower wavelength than the K-alpha emission. A larger number of electrons follow the K-alpha transition (L → K) relative to the K-alpha (L → K) transition which causes the K-alpha emission to be more intense than K-alpha. For all elements, the ratio of the intensities of K-alpha and K-alpha is very close to 2:1. K-alpha and K-alpha are close enough in wavelength that an average of the two wavelengths, K-alpha, is used in x-ray diffractometry without separation by a monochromator, which would cause a significant loss in the intensity of the incident beam.\n\nThe analogous K-alpha spectra line in hydrogen is known as Lyman alpha; however because of hydrogen's small nuclear charge, this line is in the ultraviolet, not the X-ray range.\n\nAn example of K-alpha lines are those seen for iron as iron atoms radiating X-rays spiralling into a black hole at the center of a galaxy. For such purposes, the energy of the line is adequately calculated to 2-digit accuracy by the use of Moseley's law: , where \"Z\" is the atomic number and Ry=Rydberg energy=13,6 eV. For example, K-alpha for iron () is calculated in this fashion . For astrophysical purposes, Doppler and other effects (such as gravitational broadening) show the iron K-alpha line to better accuracy than 6.4 keV.\n\n\nK-beta emissions, similar to K-alpha emissions, result when an electron transitions to the innermost \"K\" shell (principal quantum number 1) from a 3p orbital of the third or \"M\" shell (with principal quantum number 3).\n\nValues can be found in the X-Ray Transition Energies Database.\n\n\n"}

The station is north-west of London Euston on the West Coast Main Line. Hemel Hempstead is managed by London Northwestern Railway and all train services are operated by London Northwestern Railway and Southern.\n\nHemel Hempstead railway station is one of two railway stations now serving the town, the other being Apsley. Both were built when Hemel Hempstead was still small; before it was designated a New Town in 1946 and grew rapidly in size. Bus services run from there to the town centre. Also in the vicinity of the station are two pubs and the Grand Union Canal, about away.\n\nThere are four full-length (12 car) through platforms and one disused south-facing bay (on the slow lines).\n\nTicket Barriers are in operation.\n\nHemel Hempstead station was opened by the London and Birmingham Railway on 20 July 1837. Originally called \"Boxmoor\" station, it was the first terminus of the new line from the south, engineered by Robert Stephenson, which was subsequently extended to Tring in October of the same year and then to Birmingham in 1838. The decision to locate the station outside Hemel Hempstead town centre was a result of the opposition faced by the L&BR during construction of the line. There were vociferous protests from local landowners who sought to protect their estates from invasion by the \"iron horse\", including influential figures such as the Earl of Essex (Cassiobury Estate), the Earl of Clarendon (The Grove Estate) and the eminent anatomist Sir Astley Cooper (Gadebridge Estate). Turbulent public meetings were held in Berkhamsted and Watford, and in the House of Lords on 22 June 1832, Lord Brownlow of Ashridge voiced his opposition to \"\"the forcing of the proposed railway through the land and property of so great a proportion of dissentient landowners.\"\" In order to obtain Parliamentary approval, the L&BR was forced to choose an alternative route which was less favourable to Hemel Hempstead but satisfied Hertfordshire landowners.\n\nIn 1846 the L&BR was taken over by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR). As competition with the rival Midland Railway's new line through Hemel town centre increased, the LNWR operated a horse bus into the town, later replaced by a motor bus service, to poach passengers onto their own, less conveniently placed railway line. In 1912 the LNWR renamed the station \"Boxmoor and Hemel Hempstead\". The LNWR was absorbed into the new London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) in 1923 as part of the Grouping of British railway companies, and in 1930 the Boxmoor and Hemel Hempstead station name was changed to \"Hemel Hempstead and Boxmoor\". Following nationalisation in 1948, the station was under the ownership of the London Midland Region of British Railways; the line was electrified and in 1963 the Boxmoor name was dropped, and the station was simply known as \"Hemel Hempstead\".\nFor many years, Hemel Hempstead station was almost a junction – a railway embankment on the south (down) side of the station led to the end of the Nickey Line, a branch line which ran through the town centre to . The line was opened in 1877 by the Midland Railway and extended to transport coal to Duckhall gasworks, close to Boxmoor. However, due to rivalry between the Midland Railway and the London & North Western Railway, no direct connection was made between the two lines – the Nickey Line terminated approximately away from Boxmoor station at the gasworks terminus. Only occasional freight trains ran this far; passenger trains terminated in the town centre at Heath Park Halt, and there was also a town centre station on the line called \"Hemel Hempsted\". Passenger services ceased on the Nickey Line in 1947 although it remained in use as a goods line.\n\nIt was only in the last months of the Nickey Line's operations that a rail link was built at Boxmoor. Hemel Hempstead had been designated as a New Town and the town centre redevelopment plans included the demolition of the Nickey Line. In order to maintain a coal service to the gasworks, a link was built in 1959 connecting the Nickey Line to the West Coast Main Line via sidings at Boxmoor. This link was for goods trains only and no passenger service was ever provided, but it only remained in operation for six months; the gasworks shut down and the link was closed. The following year the railway viaduct over Marlowes in the town centre was demolished, removing Hemel Hempstead's last town centre rail link.\n\nThe nearby crossover at Bourne End was the site of a serious accident on 30 September 1945, when a Scottish express derailed after passing over the junction at excessive speed. The coaches rolled down a high embankment, and forty-three lives were lost.\n\nHemel Hempstead is served by frequent trains on the West Coast Main Line between - and Milton Keynes operated by London Northwestern Railway. There are additional direct services between London Euston - , and . There is also one train to and from Crewe on weekdays and some services to/from Crewe on Sundays. Hemel Hempstead is also served by the Southern cross-London service which runs to in South London via the West London Line.\n\nA typical off-peak weekday consists of the following services, in trains per hour (tph):\n\n"}

Most passenger flights utilizing the airport are domestic operations to Eilat and Tel Aviv. The airport is named after Uri Michaeli, one of the pioneers of Jewish aviation and one of the founders of aviation in Israel. The airport has one short runway, in length, and there are plans to extend it by .\n\nHaifa Airport was established by the British Mandate in 1934 as its first international airport at the location of RAF Station Haifa which originally served the British Army and the Iraqi-British oil company, APS. RAF Haifa already had passenger service by Imperial Airways to Alexandria (since 1931) and Baghdad (since 1932). In 1936 passenger services by to Beirut and Cyprus were opened. In 1937, these were joined by Palestine Airways services, as well as Ala Littoria regular services to Brindisi and Trieste via Athens. In 1938 a third of flights into Mandatory Palestine landed in Haifa; but in 1940, civil flights were stopped due to the Second World War in which the airport served the Royal Air Force's operations in the Middle East as RAF Haifa. The RAF station closed in 1948, and the airport re-opened as Haifa Airport.\n\nRAF Haifa was a Royal Air Force station in Mandatory Palestine between 1918 and 1948.\n\nOperational units at RAF Haifa 1938 to 1948:\n\nThe airport reopened for passenger traffic in 1948 with flights operated by Cyprus Airways. This was followed ten years later by Arkia Israel Airlines flights. It wasn't until 1994, however, that the airport received international status, and at this time, it was planned that the airport would serve flights to destinations across Europe. Less than a year later, the airport was placed for sale. At this time, great interest in the site was shown by the French construction group, Bouygues, as well as British Aerospace.\n\nThese expected services never really took off however, and it wasn't until 1996, and the start of Israir flights, that the airport grew. This growth was further increased in 1998 with Aeroel service. Royal Wings increased route offerings once again with flights from Jordan, whilst Scorpio started flights to Egypt. In 1998, a new terminal was opened at the airport to cater for all of the services needed in a modern international airport. In the past there were three takeoff and landing runways in the airport, of which only two still exist, and only one is currently in use.\n\nIn 2001, talk over expanding the airport restarted when then Finance Minister, Silvan Shalom called for an 800 million NIS upgrade to turn the airport into one of an international standard.\n\n2007 saw the first rise in passenger numbers and aircraft movements since 2002 with an increase of 25% in passenger numbers and a 7% increase in aircraft movements over the previous year. In general, between the peak point of its operation in 1999 and 2007 passenger number have fallen by 50%. Aircraft movements have decreased from 2002 to 2007 by 34%.\n\nThe Israel Airports Authority intends to extend the runway to 1,634m sometime in the 2020s. This will involve extending the runway northwards, across Julius Simon Road, which will then pass in a tunnel underneath the runway.\n\n\n"}

He is of Dutch ancestry. He worked as a manager with a Fortune 500 company. He joined Alternatives of Kalamazoo, Pregnancy Care Center as executive director in April 1996. In 2000, Hoogendyk was elected to the Kalamazoo County Board of Commissioners. Prior to that, he was on the Portage Zoning Board of Appeals and the Kalamazoo County Public Health Advisory Board.\n\nAfter redistricting, Jack ran for Michigan's 61st House District in 2002 and defeated Democrat James Houston 57%-43%. In 2004, he won re-election to a second term with 55% of the vote. In 2006, he won re-election to a third term with just 51% of the vote.\n\nHoogendyk was first elected to the Michigan House of Representatives in 2002 representing the 61st district, which includes the cities of Portage and Parchment, and the townships of Alamo, Kalamazoo, Oshtemo, Prairie Ronde and Texas.\n\nHoogendyk is well known for his conservative views on taxes, government spending, family issues, abortion, and affirmative action. Hoogendyk has proposed making English the official language of the State of Michigan. He was twice rated the most conservative member of the Michigan House of Representatives.\n\nIn 2006 Hoogendyk was one of a small group of conservatives to lead the fight against legislation to mandate that the state Department of Education administer to all sixth grade girls the vaccine Gardasil as a potential prevention against the risk of Human papillomavirus. Following the defeat of this legislation, no other state has implemented similar legislation.\n\nIn 2004 he announced his intent to seek the Republican nomination for Governor of Michigan but eventually dropped out of the race to endorse Republican rival Dick DeVos.\n\nIn 2008, the term-limited Hoogendyk announced that he was running in the Republican primary to contest Democrat Carl Levin's seat in the U.S. Senate. He was the only Republican on the August 5 primary ballot. Levin won re-election, defeating Hoogendyk 63%-34%.\n\nIn March 2010, Hoogendyk announced on his website that he would enter the Republican primary in Michigan's 6th congressional district against incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman Fred Upton. Upton defeated him 57%-43%, winning every county in the district.\n\nIn 2011, Hoogendyk met with the Club for Growth, a fiscally conservative 501(c)4 organization, about running against Upton in 2012. Upton has received criticism for not being conservative enough from Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, FreedomWorks, Right to Life of Michigan, and the Southwest Michigan Tea Party Patriots. He announced his candidacy on January 17, 2012. He was not able to unseat Upton and ultimately lost the primary with 33% of the vote. The election was held on August 7, 2012. Had Hoogendyk won the Republican primary, he would have faced Democrat Mike O'Brien in the general election. Upton was ultimately re-elected.\n\nHoogendyk is a Baptist. He has been married to his wife Erin since April 4, 1976, has five children and as of June 2012 had eleven grandchildren.

{"id": "1983200", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1983200", "title": "Salvador Dalí Museum", "text": "Salvador Dalí Museum\n\nThe Salvador Dalí Museum is an art museum in St. Petersburg, Florida, United States, dedicated to the works of Salvador Dalí. It houses the largest collection of Dalí's works outside Europe. It is located on the downtown St. Petersburg waterfront by 5th Avenue Southeast, Bay Shore Drive, and Dan Wheldon Way. On April 18, 2012, the AIA's Florida Chapter placed the building on its list of \"Florida Architecture: 100 Years. 100 Places\".\n\nShortly before marrying in 1942, Reynolds and Eleanor Morse attended a Dalí retrospective at the Cleveland Museum of Art. Intrigued by the artist's subject matter, and impressed by his draftsmanship, they bought their first painting a year later. This purchase began a 40-year relationship as patrons and friends of Dalí that resulted in a comprehensive collection of original Dalí work.\n\nUntil 1971, the Morses displayed their collection in their Cleveland, Ohio, home. When they loaned over 200 pieces to a Dalí retrospective in 1965, they realized that 25 years of collecting produced a mini-retrospective that needed a permanent home.\n\nIn March 1971, with Salvador Dalí presiding over the opening, the Morses opened a museum adjacent to their office building in Beachwood, Ohio. By the end of the decade with an overwhelming number of visitors, the Morses decided to again move their collection.\n\nAfter a drawn out search which drew national attention, a marine warehouse in downtown St. Petersburg, Florida was rehabilitated and the museum opened on March 7, 1982.\n\nIn mid-2008, a new location for the Dali museum was announced. Designed by Yann Weymouth of the architectural firm HOK and built by The Beck Group under the leadership of then-CEO Henry C. Beck III, it was built on the downtown waterfront next to the Mahaffey Theater, on the former site of the Bayfront Center, an arena which had been demolished in 2004.\n\nThe new, larger and more storm-secure museum opened on January 11, 2011.\n\nReportedly costing over $30 million, the surrealism-inspired structure features a large glass entryway and skylight made of 1.5 inch thick glass. Referred to as the \"Enigma\", the glass entryway is 75 feet tall and encompasses a spiral staircase. The remaining walls are composed of 18-inch thick concrete, designed to protect the collection from hurricanes.\nThe Museum is a member of the American Alliance of Museums (AAM) and of the North American Reciprocal Museums program.\n\nThe museum features a variety of different events for families to attend. Some events include performances, workshops, films, lectures, different types of fundraising, and food & drink events. Many previous events have allowed members to participate in handmade holiday card workshops where participants created their very own holiday card including a Dalí theme. In addition, there has been various poetry performances which have occurred every Thursday of the month, and lectures such as, coffee with a curator, a presentation on a theme-oriented topic that discusses a variety of topics in relation to Dalí.\n\nThe museum's collection includes 96 oil paintings, over 100 watercolors and drawings, 1,300 graphics, photographs, sculptures and objets d'art, and an extensive archival library. The Museum Library contains over 7,000 volumes, exhibition and sale catalogs, video, sound recordings, and special collections related to Dalí's life, Surrealism, and the Avant-garde. The library also holds the donated collection of Albert Field, New York collector and Dalí archivist. Recently, the museum opened a new exhibit named Dali Lives, which uses artificial intelligence for visors to experience an interactive modern day Dali. Permanent collection displays are periodically rotated, and several temporary shows are mounted each year.\n\nThe museum is home to 7 of the 18 \"masterwork\" paintings by Dalí (including \"The Hallucinogenic Toreador\" and \"The Discovery of America by Christopher Columbus\"), the most of any museum in the world. To be considered a masterwork these paintings must measure at least in any direction, and have been worked on for over a year.\n\nIn addition to displaying the work of Dalí, the museum aims to educate the public and promote understanding, enjoyment and scholarly examination of art through the exhibition of works by Dalí and artists of similar vision.\n\nWith the exception of the Dalí Theater-Museum created by Dalí himself in his home town of Figueres, Catalonia, St. Petersburg's Dalí Museum has the world's largest collections of Dalí's works.\n\nDuring the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the Salvador Dalí Museum made their gallery available for viewing online.\n\n\n"}

Written by Gerald Di Pego, the film is about a mysterious man who finds himself drawn to a female police officer with whom he forms a relationship that helps each to deal with trauma from their past. The original music score was composed by Marco Beltrami. The film received ALMA Award Nominations for Outstanding Actress (Jennifer Lopez) and Outstanding Director (Luis Mandoki).\n\nOn a wet rainy night in Chicago, police officer Sharon Pogue is at the scene of a serious traffic accident holding the hand of one of the victims, pleading that he hold on and not give up. One year later, Sharon is frustrated with the men she dates, and has become estranged from her family for having her father arrested for beating her mother Josephine. Her father and brother, Larry, have never forgiven her, and her anger is affecting her police work.\n\nA man known only as \"Catch\" wanders the streets of Chicago in a trance-like state, doing good deeds for strangers and neighbors. One day he sees Sharon at a diner and watches her from across the street, and she notices him watching her. Just then a car pulls up and blasts the diner with machine gun fire, and Sharon and her partner chase after the criminals. Sharon catches up with one criminal and in the ensuing struggle, he gets her gun and shoots her twice in the chest. Seeing that she is protected by her bulletproof vest, he prepares to shoot her in the head, but Catch jumps the man and knocks the gun away, saving her life. That night, Sharon and Catch meet at a tavern and have a drink. A grateful Sharon tries to learn more about Catch, but he does not talk about himself. Sharon invites him to her apartment, and after some awkward moments between the two, they share a kiss. Catch abruptly stops and leaves the apartment, leaving Sharon confused.\n\nThe next evening Sharon finds a dandelion taped to her mailbox with Catch's phone number. She calls and awkwardly invites him to breakfast at a coffee shop the next morning. When Sharon wakes up, she has second thoughts and calls Catch to cancel their breakfast date. Catch is already at the coffee shop and never gets the message. Upset at being stood up, he goes to Sharon's apartment and criticizes her for not showing up for her \"appointment\", and then storms out. Sharon follows him to his nearly empty apartment. Surprised at the living conditions, she demands to know more about him, but Catch refuses to reveal anything about his past. He only says that he is starting \"from scratch\".\n\nFollowing the advice of his mother-in-law Elanora, Catch calls Sharon and apologizes, and the two continue seeing each other. They go on a lakeside picnic in a state park and share a romantic swim, after which they make passionate love on the shore. In the coming days, Catch is there to comfort her after a family confrontation. His positive influence begins to show in her police work. One night they go to a blues club, and after the band has played a number, Catch notices a trumpet sitting on the bandstand. He picks up the trumpet and starts to play a soulful version of the tune \"Nature Boy\". As they're leaving, the owner approaches him, calling him \"Steve Lambert\", and asking where's he's been. Catch denies even knowing the man and walks away.\n\nThe next day, Sharon investigates the name Steven Lambert in the police files and discovers that he is the man whose hand she held at the site of a traffic accident a year earlier, and that Catch's wife and child died in the accident. She goes to the house he abandoned after the accident and learns that he was a jazz musician and that the accident occurred on his son's birthday, causing Catch to create a mental block. Wanting to help Catch heal from his emotional wounds, she tries to talk to him about the accident and takes him to the cemetery to see the graves of his family, but he gets very upset and walks away. Sharon visits Elanora who is actually Catch's former mother-in-law. Sharon is looking for some way of helping the man she loves, and Elanora encourages patience and tells Sharon that Catch will find his way in his own time.\n\nAt her parents' wedding vow renewal ceremony, Sharon tries talking to her father but he tells her that he feels like he doesn't have a daughter. As Sharon starts to leave, she stops and tells the videographer a wonderful story about her father playing with her and her brother when they were children. She is deeply moved by this memory. Her father overhears it and is also emotionally affected, but when Sharon looks at him, he turns away. Meanwhile, Catch finally goes to the cemetery and talks to his deceased wife and child, explaining how he remembers all the wonderful moments they shared. As Sharon leaves the reception, she sees Catch waiting by her car. They embrace and profess their love for each other. As they prepare to leave, Catch tells her that he'll drive.\n\nCanadian actor Dan Petronijevic, known years later for the television series \"19-2\" and \"Letterkenny\", plays the fighting kid that grabs Officer Sharon inappropriately.\n\nPrincipal photography started on May 8, 2000 and finished in early August that same year.\n\n\"Angel Eyes\" was filmed in the following locations: \n\nAlthough the story is set in Chicago, several very clear shots of the Toronto skyline, including Toronto's very recognizable CN Tower, appear in the film, along with other recognizable Toronto landmarks, such as the Honest Ed's storefront, the Sam the Record Man neon light and a TTC streetcar. The scenes in and around Sharon's parents home were filmed at the Playter Farmhouse, an historic building near Danforth Avenue in Toronto. Some scenes were filmed in the village of Elora, Ontario, at Elora Gorge.\n\nUpon its theatrical release, \"Angel Eyes\" received mixed reviews. On the review aggregator web site \"Rotten Tomatoes\", the film holds a 33% positive rating from critics based on 132 reviews. The site's consensus states: \"Though the earlier part of the movie suggested something more, the movie turns out to be nothing more than a schmaltzy romance.\"\n\nIn his review in the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", Roger Ebert gave the film three of four stars and applauding the performance of Jennifer Lopez, whom he describes as \"the real thing, one of those rare actresses who can win our instinctive sympathy. She demonstrates that in \"Angel Eyes\". Ebert noted that although the film is a cop movie, \"its real story doesn't involve the police, it involves damaged lives and the possibility that love can heal.\" Ebert concludes:\nIn his review in the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", Mick LaSalle called the film \"a rare thing—a well-acted character study of a hardworking woman, by a screenwriter (Gerald DiPego) and a director with enough integrity to dispense with the usual Hollywood distractions.\" LaSalle concluded:\nIn his review in \"The New York Times\", Stephan Holden focused his critique on the casting, writing, \"Watching these two share some awkward smooches that are supposed to transport them over the moon is a little like imagining Jane Russell and Montgomery Clift in a steamy clinch.\" Holden concludes:\nIn North America, the film opened at #4 in its opening weekend and grossed $24,174,218 domestically. All UK versions were cut to obtain a 15-rating. Warner Bros. had to remove the aggressive use of graphic language or the film would have been rated 18. The film was a box office bomb, ultimately grossing $29,715,606 worldwide, well below its $53 million budget. Available on Netflix streaming in November 2018.\n\n\n"}

It is located just beside Berkhamsted Castle, overlooking the Grand Junction Canal. The station is north west of London Euston on the West Coast Main Line. London Northwestern Railway operates services to London, Northampton and many other destinations.\n\nThere are 4 platforms of 12-car length on both the fast and slow lines. The platforms are arranged around a central island and two side platforms. The station is relatively unusual on the route in that most of the original buildings have been retained.\n\nThe present Berkhamsted station dates from 1875, and is located on the Lower King's road on the junction with Brownlow Road. The original station building, opened in 1838, was located approximately south-east of the present structure, near the bridge onto Castle Street. It was designed in an Elizabethan style of architecture with a brick gabled booking hall. The building was replaced by a new station with additional sidings in 1875 when the railway was widened, the sidings replacing an earlier goods yard near Gravel Path. In 1887, the fastest train would depart at 08:54 and arrive at London Euston at 09:35, with one stop at , a 41-minute journey.\n\nDuring the building of the London and Birmingham Railway (the L&BR, today's West Coast Main Line) in the 1830s, Berkhamsted was for a few years a centre of railway construction. The armies of navvies, bricklayers and miners brought in from the English Midlands, Ireland, London and the North of England led to overcrowding in Berkhamsted and the rowdy behaviour of the labourers was said to have offended the genteel townsfolk. Seven young men aged 18–26 were killed while working on the Berkhamsted section of the railway.\n\nBefore construction work on the Berkhamsted section of the L&BR began, the project was subject to public protest. Many landowners and turnpike trustees in Hertfordshire were opposed to the new railway line, and protest meetings were held at the King's Arms Hotel in Berkhamsted. Although local opposition to the \"iron horse\" was led by noblemen such as the Earls of Essex, Clarendon and Brownlow, the railway line received Royal Assent in 1833.\n\nLed by chief engineer Robert Stephenson, works commenced in 1834 to build a high railway embankment on top of the ruined barbican and moat of Berkhamsted Castle. The brick embankment was built on deep foundations using earth taken from the Sunnyside cutting a mile further south. Once railway tracks were laid, it was possible to use a steam locomotive to move earth and bricks: the \"Harvey Coombe\" (or \"Harvey Combe\") was brought up from London by barge on the Grand Junction Canal to assist construction work, and was assembled at Pix Farm in Bourne End. When this locomotive began running on the line works, it was the first time any local people had seen a railway engine.\n\nThe L&BR line opened in 1837, with trains running between London and Boxmoor in July, with service extended to Tring in October of that year. The first passenger train passed through Berkhamsted on 16 October 1837, 59 minutes after leaving London.\nVarious plans were put forward in the 1880s by the LNWR (successor to the L&BR) to build a branch line from Berkhamsted to , but these were not realised. The Great Central Railway also considered a proposal to extend the branch from Chalfont Road to Chesham further north to Berkhamsted and Tring. This proposal was abandoned.\n\nIn 1887 there was a proposal to build a narrow-gauge steam tramway along the main road from Hemel Hempstead to Bourne End, and then along the Bourne Gutter Valley to Chesham. Campaigners sought to extend this route via Berkhamsted, but the project also came to nothing.\n\nIn 2013, as part of its \"Access for All\" programme, Network Rail and London Midland began construction work to install lifts to provide access for disabled passengers to platforms, as required by the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. Three lifts were completed and eventually opened for public use on Friday 13 March 2015, serving platforms 1, 2/3 and 4.\n\nAn electrical substation was installed outside the front of the station in April 2014 to improve the electricity supply to overhead wires on the West Coast Main Line. The installation, which is enclosed by metal railings, was criticised for its appearance and prominent position in front of a Victorian railway station and in close proximity to the 11th-century Berkhamsted Castle.\n\nAt Berkhamsted, Monday to Saturdays there are four trains per hour southbound to London Euston. There are two trains an hour north to Tring, along with two to Milton Keynes Central, one of which is operated by Southern. There is also an hourly service to Northampton. Berkhamsted is also served by an hourly cross-London service operated by Southern which runs via the West London Line to and .\n\nOn Monday-Friday there is one train to and from Crewe and some services to/from Crewe on Sundays.\n\nOn Sundays there are hourly services towards Milton Keynes, Tring and Northampton, and three an hour towards London Euston.\n\nIn the \"London & South East Rail Utilisation Strategy\" (RUS) document published by Network Rail in 2011, a proposal was put forward to extend the Crossrail lines currently construction in central London along the West Coast Main Line as far as . The diversion of rail services through central London would enable a direct link from stations such as Berkhamsted to West End stations such as and would alleviate congestion at Euston station; Crossrail services currently planned to terminate at due to capacity limitations would also be able to continue further west, allowing for a more efficient use of the line. An announcement made in August 2014 by the then transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin indicated that the government was actively evaluating the possibility of extending Crossrail as far as Tring, however in August 2016, the Department for Transport confirmed that the scheme had been cancelled due to \"poor overall value for money to the taxpayer\".\n"}
{"id": "1983210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1983210", "title": "Microsoft Active Accessibility", "text": "Microsoft Active Accessibility\n\nMicrosoft Active Accessibility (MSAA) is an Application Programming Interface (API) for user interface accessibility. MSAA was introduced as a platform add-on to Microsoft Windows 95 in 1997. MSAA is designed to help Assistive Technology (AT) products interact with standard and custom user interface (UI) elements of an application (or the operating system), as well as to access, identify, and manipulate an application's UI elements. AT products work with MSAA enabled applications in order to provide better access for individuals who have physical or cognitive difficulties, impairments, or disabilities. Some examples of AT products are screen readers for users with limited sight, on screen keyboards for users with limited physical access, or narrators for users with limited hearing. MSAA can also be used for automated testing tools, and computer-based training applications.\n\nThe current and latest specification of MSAA is found in part of Microsoft UI Automation Community Promise Specification.\n\nActive Accessibility was initially referred to as \"OLE Accessibility\" and this heritage is reflected in the naming of its binary components such as codice_1 and the header file codice_2 which contains definitions and declarations. As part of Microsoft's ActiveX branding push in March 1996, OLE Accessibility was renamed ActiveX Accessibility (sometimes referred to as AXA) and presented as such at the Microsoft Professional Developers Conference in San Francisco, March 1996. Later, the ActiveX branding was reserved for internet-specific technologies, and ActiveX Accessibility became Active Accessibility and frequently shortened to MSAA.\n\nMSAA was originally made available in April 1997 as part of the Microsoft Active Accessibility Software Developers Kit (SDK) version 1.0. The SDK packaged included documentation, programming libraries, sample source code, and a Re-Distributable Kit (RDK) for accessible technology vendors to include with their products. The RDK included updated operating system components for Microsoft Windows 95. Since Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4, MSAA has been built-into all versions of the Windows platform, and has received periodic upgrades and patches over time.\n\nProgrammatic exposure for assistive technology applications on Windows has historically been provided through MSAA. However newer applications are now using Microsoft UI Automation (UIA), which was introduced in Windows Vista and the .NET Framework 3.0.\n\nThe following Active Accessibility versions have been released: \nThe motivating factor behind the development of MSAA was to allow an available and seamless communication mechanism between the underlying operating system or applications and assistive technology products.\n\nThe programmatic goal of MSAA is to allow Windows controls to expose basic information, such as name, location on screen, or type of control, and state information such as visibility, enabled, or selected.\n\nMSAA is based on the Component Object Model (COM). COM defines a mechanism for applications and operating systems to communicate.\n\nFigure 1 shows a high-level architecture of MSAA.\n\nApplications (e.g., word processor) are called Servers in MSAA because they provide, or serve, information about their user interfaces (UI). Accessibility tools (e.g., screen readers) are called Clients in MSAA because they consume and interact with UI information from an application.\n\nThe system component of the MSAA framework, Oleacc.dll, aids in the communication between accessibility tools (clients) and applications (servers). The code boundary indicates the programmatic boundaries between applications that provide UI accessibility information and accessibility tools that interact with the UI on behalf of users. The boundary can also be a process boundary when MSAA clients have their own process.\n\nThe UI is represented as a hierarchy of accessible objects; changes and actions are represented as WinEvents.\n\nThe accessible object is the central interface of MSAA, and is represented by an IAccessible COM interface and an integer ChildId. It allows applications to expose a tree structure that represents the structure of the UI. Each element of this tree exposes a set of properties and methods that allow the corresponding UI element to be manipulated. MSAA clients can access the programmatic UI information through a standard API.\n\nMSAA communicates information by sending small chunks of information about elements of a program to the assistive technology object (AT). The four critical pieces of information on which the AT relies to help users interact with applications are an element's role, name, value, and state:\n\n\nMicrosoft provides a complete list of controls and their functions.\n\nRole information is based on the type of UI control with which a developer wants to interact. For example, if a developer is implementing a button that is clickable, the developer would select Pushbutton as the Role to implement. The following table shows an example list of MSAA Roles and their related descriptions.\n\nThe Names for elements in an application are assigned in the code by the developer. Many objects such as icons, menus, check boxes, combo boxes, and other controls have labels that are displayed to users. Any label that is displayed to users on a control (e.g., a button) is the default for the object's name property. Ensure the Name of the object makes sense to a user and describes the control properly. The Name property must not include the control role or type information, such as button or list, or it will conflict with the text from the role property (acquired from GetRoleText function of MSAA API).\n\nValue is used when a developer wants to return information from objects in the form of a string. Value may be returned for objects where percentages, integers, textual or visual information is contained in the object. For example, the property values returned from scroll bar and trackbar accessible objects can indicate percentages in strings.\n\nNot all objects have a Value assigned to them.\n\nThe State property describes an object's status at a moment in time. Microsoft Active Accessibility provides object state constants, defined in oleacc.h, that are combined to identify an object's state. If predefined state values are returned, clients use GetStateText to retrieve a localized string that describes the state. All objects support the State property.\n\nMicrosoft designed the Active Accessibility object model during and after the release of Windows 95. The model is based on roles, each role representing a type of a user interface element. These roles are limited to user interface elements in common use at the time. For example, there is no text object model to help assistive technologies deal split buttons which combine multiple UI elements into one. MSAA does not attempt to represent styled text such as markup text or rich text documents. While MSAA still has the Value property, it can host only simple, non-styled text in its value. At the time, it was felt that the Microsoft Text Object Model (MS-TOM) would be more appropriate for expressing the attributes of formatted text. However, MS-TOM's complexity and limited initial adoption outside of Microsoft hampered access to rich text.\n\nAnother limitation involves navigating the object model. MSAA represents the UI as a hierarchy of accessible objects in a manner similar to Windows' Window Manager. Clients navigate from one accessible object to another using the IAccessible::accNavigate method. However, servers implemented accNavigate in unpredictable ways and often not at all. Clients, however, must be able to deal with all approaches for any MSAA server. This ambiguity means extra work for client implementers, and the complexity can contribute to problems depending on the server implementations.\n\nBeing a COM-based binary interface, IAccessible is immutable and cannot be changed without creating another interface. The result is that you cannot expose new roles, behavior or properties through the existing IAccessible-based object model. While intended to be a common subset of information about base UI elements, it was found to be difficult to extend to include information about new interaction methods.\n\nMSAA was initially available as an add-on to Windows 95.

{"id": "1983217", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1983217", "title": "Honda Super Cub", "text": "Honda Super Cub\n\nThe Honda Super Cub or Honda Cub is a Honda underbone motorcycle with a four stroke single cylinder engine ranging in displacement from .\n\nIn continuous manufacture since 1958 with production surpassing 60 million in 2008, 87 million in 2014, and 100 million in 2017, the Super Cub is the most produced motor vehicle in history. Variants include the C100, C50, C70, C90, C100EX and C70 Passport, as well as the Honda Trail series.\n\nThe Super Cub's US advertising campaign, You meet the nicest people on a Honda, had a lasting impact on Honda's image and on American attitudes to motorcycling, and is often used as a marketing case study.\n\nThe idea for a new \"\" motorcycle was conceived in 1956, when Honda Motor's Soichiro Honda and Takeo Fujisawa toured Germany and witnessed the popularity of mopeds and lightweight motorcycles. Soichiro Honda was primarily the engineering and production leader of the company, always with an eye towards winning on the racetrack, while his close partner Fujisawa was the man of finance and business, heading up sales and formulating strategies intended to dominate markets and utterly destroy Honda Motor's competitors. Fujisawa had been thinking about a long term expansion strategy, and unlike other Japanese companies, they did not want to simply boost production to cash in on the recent economic boom in Japan. A small, high-performance motorcycle was central to his plans. Upwardly mobile consumers in postwar Europe typically went from a bicycle to a clip-on engine, then bought a scooter, then a bubble car, and then a small car and onwards. Fujisawa saw that a motorcycle did not fit in this pattern for the average person, and he saw an opportunity to change that. Soichiro Honda was at the time tired of listening to Fujisawa talk about his new motorcycle idea; Honda came to Europe to win the Isle of Man TT race and wanted to think about little else. \n\nFujisawa and Honda visited Kreidler and Lambretta showrooms, as well as others, researching the kind of motorcycle Fujisawa had in mind. Fujisawa said these designs had \"no future\" and would not sell well. His concept was a two wheeler for everyman, one that would appeal to both developed and developing countries, urban and rural. The new motorcycle needed to be technologically simple to survive in places without up-to-date know-how and access to advanced tools or reliable spare parts supplies. The common consumer complaints of noise, poor reliability, especially in the electrics, and general difficulty of use would have to be addressed. Because Honda was a large company growing larger, it needed a mass-appeal product that could be produced on an enormous scale. The design had to be sorted out before production began, because it would be too costly to fix problems in the vast numbers that were to be manufactured. The scooter type nearly fitted the bill, but was too complex for developing countries to maintain, and the small wheels did poorly on badly maintained or nonexistent roads. Another of Fujisawa's requirements was that it could be ridden with one hand while carrying a tray of \"soba\" noodles, saying to Honda, \"If you can design a small motorcycle, say 50 cc with a cover to hide the engine and hoses and wires inside, I can sell it. I don't know how many \"soba\" noodle shops there are in Japan, but I bet you that every shop will want one for deliveries.\"\n\nOnce interested, Soichiro Honda began developing the Super Cub on his return to Japan. The following year Honda displayed a mockup to Fujisawa that finally matched what he had in mind, Fujisawa declaring the annual sales would be 30,000 per month, half again as many as the entire monthly two-wheeler market in Japan. His goal was to export motorcycles on a scale yet unseen in the economic disorder of postwar Japan, when most companies' halting trade efforts were handled through foreign trading companies. Honda would have to establish its own overseas subsidiary to provide the necessary service and spare parts distribution in a large country like the US. To this end American Honda Motor Company was founded in 1959. In 1961 a sales network was established in Germany, then in Belgium and the UK in 1962, and then France in 1964.\n\nThe Honda Juno had been the first scooter to use polyester resin, or fiberglass reinforced plastic (FRP), bodywork, and even though production of the Juno had stopped in 1954 as a result of Honda Motor's financial and labor problems at the time, Fujisawa continued to encourage research in polyester resin casting techniques, and these efforts bore fruit for the Super Cub. The new motorcycle's fairing would be polyethylene, the most widely used plastic, which reduced weight over FRP, but Honda's supplier had never made such a large die cast before, so the die had to be provided by Honda. The Super Cub was the first motorcycle ever to use a plastic fairing. Motorcycling historian Clement Salvadori wrote that the plastic front fender and leg shields were, \"perhaps the Cub's greatest contribution; plastic did the job just as well as metal at considerably lower cost.\" The technology developed in the Isle of Man TT racing program was equally vital to the new lightweight motorcycle, making possible from a \"50 cc\" four-stroke Honda engine, where the first engine the company built a decade earlier, a \"fairly exact copy\" of the \"50 cc\" two stroke war-surplus Tohatsu engine Honda had been selling as motorized bicycle auxiliary engine, had only a output. Honda's first four stroke, the 1951 E-type, had just a little more power than the Super Cub, , with nearly triple the displacement, .\n\nTo make the new motorcycle, Honda built a new ¥ factory in Suzuka, Mie to manufacture 30,000, and with two shifts, 50,000, Super Cubs per month. The factory was modeled on the Volkswagen Beetle production line in Wolfsburg, Germany. Until then, Honda's top models had sold only 2,000 to 3,000 per month, and observers thought the cost of the new plant too risky an expenditure. Edward Turner of BSA went to Japan to see the motorcycle industry in September 1960, and said that investments the size of the Suzuka plant were \"extremely dangerous\" because the US motorcycle market was already saturated. When completed in 1960, the Suzuka Factory was the largest motorcycle factory in the world, and was a model for Honda's mass production facilities of the future. The economies of scale achieved at Suzuka cut 18% from the cost of producing each Super Cub when Suzuka could be run at full capacity, but in the short term Honda faced excess inventory problems when the new factory went into operation before the full sales and distribution network was in place.\n\nThe Super Cub has been compared to the Ford Model T, Volkswagen Beetle and the Jeep as an icon of 20th century industry and transport. The C100 used a pressed steel monocoque chassis, with the horizontal engine placed below the central spine, a configuration now called the \"step through\" or \"underbone\" motorcycle. By some criteria, the type of motorcycle the Super Cub falls into is difficult to classify, landing somewhere between a scooter and a motorcycle, and sometimes it was called a moped, \"\", or scooterette. \n\nThe plastic fairing ran from below the handlebars and under the footpegs, protecting the rider's legs from wind and road debris, as well as hiding the engine from view. This design was like the full enclosure of a scooter, but unlike a scooter the engine and gearbox unit was not fixed to the rear axle. This had several benefits. It moved the engine down and away from the seat, detaching the rear swingarm motion from the drivetrain for lower unsprung weight. It also made engine cooling air flow more direct, and made it possible to fit larger wheels. Placing the engine in the center of the frame, rather than close to the rear wheel, greatly improved front-rear balance. The fuel tank was located under the hinged seat, which opened to reveal the fuel filler inlet. The 17 inch wheels, in comparison to the typical 10 inch wheels of a scooter, were more stable, particularly on rough roads, and psychologically made the motorcycle more familiar, having an appearance closer to a bicycle than a small-wheel scooter.\n\nThe pushrod overhead valve (OHV) air-cooled four stroke single cylinder engine had a bore × stroke, displacing , and could produce at 9,500 rpm, for maximum speed of , under favorable conditions. The low compression ratio meant the engine could consume inexpensive and commonly available low octane fuel, as well as minimizing the effort to kick start the engine, making the extra weight and expense of an electric starter an unnecessary creature comfort. Though some of the many Super Cub variations came with both kick and electric start, the majority sold well without it. Even the latest 2011 model year Japanese domestic market (JDM) Super Cub 50 and Super Cub 110 versions, with modern technology and conveniences like fuel injection and a fuel gauge, were not offered with an electric start option.\n\nThe sequential shifting three speed gearbox was manually shifted, but clutchless, without the need for a clutch lever control, using instead a centrifugal clutch along with a plate clutch slaved to the footchange lever to engage and disengage the gearbox from the engine. While not intuitive to learn, once the rider got used to it, the automated manual transmission, \"took the terror out of motorcycling\" for novice riders. Unlike many scooter CVTs, the centrifugal clutch made it possible to push start the Super Cub, a useful advantage if the need arose.\n\nThe early Super Cubs used a 6 volt ignition magneto mounted on the flywheel, with a battery to help maintain power to the lights, while later ones were upgraded to capacitor discharge ignition (CDI) systems. The lubrication system did not use an oil pump or oil filter, but was a primitive splash-fed system for both the crankcase and gearbox, with a non-consumable screen strainer to collect debris in the engine oil. Both the front and rear brakes were drums. On both the front and rear wheels were 2.25\" × 17\" wire spoke wheels, with full-width hubs.\n\nHonda recommended daily checks of the lights, horn, tire pressure, brakes, fuel and oil level, and a weekly check of the battery electrolyte level. The new engine break-in maintenance was done at , requiring adjustment of the valve tappets and contact breaker points, and an oil change, and the rider was advised to stay under for the first . Every the spark plug needed cleaning, and the chain adjustment checked, and every an oil change, breaker point check, and valve adjustment was due. At , major maintenance was due, requiring the removal and cleaning of the carburetor, drive chain, exhaust silencer, and wheel bearings. The rider closed a manual choke to aid in starting at cold temperatures. By the standards of the day, this was a simple motorcycle, with minimal maintenance demands, and it earned a reputation for high reliability.\n\nIn June 1963 in US media, Honda began the 12-year-long advertising campaign \"You meet the nicest people on a Honda\", created by Grey Advertising. Grey had bought the idea from a UCLA undergraduate student, who had created the concept for a class assignment. The event marked the beginning of the decline of domestic and British motorcycle brands in the US market, and the rise of Honda and the other Japanese companies. In December 1965, Edward Turner said the sale of small Japanese motorcycles was good for BSA, by attracting new riders who would graduate to larger machines, not anticipating that the Japanese would advance over the next 5 years to directly threaten British bikes with technically sophisticated models such as the Honda CB750, and the Kawasaki Z1. As a case study in business and marketing, the campaign is still remembered half a century later, with one strategic management textbook saying, \"Honda and the Supercub is probably the best known and most debated case in business strategy.\" It was credited with having \"invented the concept of lifestyle marketing.\"\n\nSpecific elements of the Super Cub's design were integral to the campaign, such as the enclosed chain that kept chain lubricant from being flung on the rider's clothing, and the leg shield that similarly blocked road debris and hid the engine, and the convenience of the automated manual transmission. Presenting the Super Cub as a consumer appliance not requiring mechanical aptitude and an identity change into \"a motorcyclist\", or worse, \"a biker\", differentiated Honda's offering, because, \"the dedication required to maintain bikes of that era limited ownership to a relatively small demographic, often regarded as young men known for their black leather jackets and snarling demeanors.\"\n\nRather than remaining limited to trying to convince traditional downmarket male buyers to switch to Honda from other brands with the macho approach of most motorcycle advertising at the time, Honda broke new ground. The ad campaign sought to improve the image of motorcycling in general and expand the overall size of the motorcycle market by attracting new riders. In a stroke of good fortune for Honda, Brian Wilson and Mike Love composed the 1964 song \"Little Honda\", extolling the joys of riding the Honda 50, and even inviting the listener to visit their local Honda dealership, in language that sounded as if it could have been written, or at least paid for, by Honda's advertising copywriters, yet it was not a commercial jingle. The song was released by The Hondells in 1964, followed by the release of the original recording by The Beach Boys. In 1965 The Hondells released \"You Meet the Nicest People on a Honda\", another song promoting the Super Cub, which was actually used in Honda's TV spots, as a B side to their version of \"Sea Cruise.\"\n\nThe long-running campaign, including the slogan, the music, and the upbeat images of respectable, middle and upper-class people, particularly women, riding Hondas became closely associated with the Honda brand ever since. The image Honda created was contrasted with the one percenter \"bad boy\" biker and became a focal point of Japan bashing boosterism of US-made Harley-Davidson motorcycles.\n\nAside from Harley-Davidson fans, the company itself had a more conflicted reaction to the successful Honda \"You meet the nicest people\" campaign. At first they were offended at the suggestion that Harley-Davidson riders were not \"nice people.\" Harley-Davidson had, since its founding in 1903, scrupulously cultivated an image of staid respectability, and would not begin to tentatively embrace the \"outlaw\" demographic of their customer base for at least another ten years. In 1964 they denied any association with one-percenter bikers, and so distanced themselves from the implications of Honda's campaign. But they also \"tried to have it both ways\", and soon joined Vespa and Yamaha in producing ads that were \"suspiciously similar\" to \"You meet the nicest people.\" Whether they were being offended by or imitating Honda, at the time Harley-Davidson did not share the interpretation that Honda's advertisements, \"added to the macho Harley image.\"\n\nThe Honda Super Cub debuted in 1958, ten years after the establishment of Honda Motor Co. Ltd. The original 1952 Honda Cub F had been a clip-on bicycle engine. Honda kept the name but added the prefix 'Super' for the all-new lightweight machine. The Super Cub sold poorly at first, owing mainly to the recession in Japan, and then three months after the 1958 launch, when customer complaints began rolling in about slipping clutches. Honda salesmen and factory workers gave up holidays to repair the affected Super Cubs, visiting each customer in person. When it was imported to the US, the name was changed to Honda 50, and later Honda Passport C70, and C90, because the Piper Super Cub airplane trademark had precedence. Similarly, in Britain they were only badged \"Honda 50\", \"Honda 90\" etc. as the Triumph Tiger Cub preceded.\n\nThe , included the 1958 Honda Super Cub C100 as one of their \"240 Landmarks of Japanese Automotive Technology\".\n\nThe first Super Cub variation was the C102, launched in April 1960. The C102 had electric start in addition to kick starting, and battery and coil ignition instead of magneto, but was otherwise the same as the C100.\n\nThe enlarged OHV engine of the 1963 C200 was used on the 1965 CM90 step-through. New in 1965 was a engine with a chain-driven overhead camshaft (OHC). This was used in two new models: the C65, a step-through with , and the S65, with a frame like the C110/C200 and @ 10,000 rpm.\n\nIn 1966 the C50 appeared and remained in production through the mid 80s, becoming one of the most widespread and familiar versions of the Super Cub. Honda replaced the C100's 50 cc OHV engine with the OHC alloy head and iron cylinder engine from the CS50 and C65, which increased power from . Similarly the CM90 was replaced in 1966 with the OHC CM91, which a year later on 1967, got restyled forks and headlamp like the C50, to become the familiar C90. Though the basic design of Cub remained unchanged, new styling and improvements included enclosed front forks. The C100 stayed in production alongside the newer versions one more year, until 1967. After 1980 the USA C70 was called the C70 Passport.\nBecause some countries offered age restriction and tax advantages for mopeds, Honda also introduced the C310S, a moped version of the Super Cub complete with bicycle pedals. The C310S fuel tank was relocated from beneath the seat to a more conventional placement at the top of the leg shield. This iteration is now somewhat rare, having been marketed primarily in the Benelux countries.\n\nIn 1982, for most markets, Honda fitted a new capacitor discharge ignition (CDI) system to replace the earlier contact points ignition, thereby helping to meet emission standards in markets such as the US. At the same time the electrical system was changed from 6 volt to 12 volt.\n\nIn 1984, Honda released restyled versions of the Cubs on some markets, with square lamps and plastic-covered handlebars and rear mudguard. On the domestic Japanese market the square style was optional, but in some places such as the UK they replaced imports of the traditionally styled round lamp Cub.\n\nIn 1986, a larger \"100 cc\" HA05E engine model was introduced especially for Asian markets. The newer \"100 cc\" model was developed exclusively for Southeast Asian market, especially in Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam, where underbones were very popular, with new features such as a telescopic front suspension to replace the older leading link suspension, and a four-speed transmission to replace the older three-speed transmission used in older Cub variants. The \"100 cc\" model was initially known as the Honda Dream in Thailand and Honda EX5 in Malaysia, before being standardised as the Honda EX5 Dream in 2003. In addition, Honda Japan began importing the made-in-Thailand Dream as the Super Cub C100EX in 1988. The Japanese C100EX was later being facelifted in 1993, while the Southeast Asian EX5 Dream retains the 1986 design until the present day, with only minor cosmetic changes. In 2011, the carbureted EX5 Dream was phased out in Thailand and being replaced with the fuel-injected Honda Dream 110i, with the powertrain being derived from the fuel-injected Honda Wave 110i.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Honda introduced their newer NF series motorcycles, known as Honda Wave series, called the Honda Innova in some markets, which use steel tube frames, front disc brake and plastic cover sets in various displacement options: \"100 cc\", \"110 cc\" and \"125 cc\". Though not Cubs, these bikes sold consistently well particularly in European countries, where the production of Honda Cub models had been previously discontinued. However, the production of Honda Cubs in Asia, Africa and South America still continues today, even though the newer Honda Wave Series and other designs have been introduced alongside the Cub.\n\nStarting in 2007 Japanese market Cubs began using Honda's PGM-FI fuel injection.\n\nHonda made a 2018 model year special edition to commemorate the 60th anniversary of Super Cub production, with a celebration at the Ōzu, Kumamoto factory where the 100 millionth Super Cub was produced in October 2017 .\n\nThe C110 Sports Cub debuted in October 1960. The C110 was more like a traditional motorcycle that the rider had to straddle, not a step-through. It had a different frame, with the fuel tank on top of the frame and in front of the seat, and the frame's steel tube spine ran horizontally from the head tube to the seat. It also had a bit more power, increased from @ 9,500 rpm. Sub-variants of the Sports Cub were the C111, absent the pillion seat, and C110D, also called C114, which had a low exhaust pipe. Early versions of the Sports Cub had a 3 speed gearbox but later this was changed to 4 speed. The C102 stayed in production for six model years, through 1965, and the C110 Sports Cub through 1966.\n\nIn 1963 came an enlarged OHV engine of and . It was used first in the C200, which had a frame like the C110, with more upright handlebars.\n\nThe S65's last year of production was 1967, and the CD65 and CL65 took its place for only one year, 1968. These had the higher-revving engine of the CS65. Then the C70 replaced the C65 and CL65 in 1969. It had the same peak horsepower, but at 9,000 rpm instead of 10,000, and more torque, at 7,000 rpm instead of at 8,000 rpm. It was introduced in the USA, Canada and Asia at launch and in the UK in 1972.\n\nIn 1960 the CZ100 arrived, using the same engine in a much smaller frame with only 5\" wheels. First of the Honda Z series, the CZ100 was meant only as a short-distance novelty or paddock bike, but instead found popularity in the monkey bike niche.\nAn on- and off-road version of the Super Cub, what today would be classed as a dual-sport motorcycle but called a trail bike at the time, the CA100T Trail 50, came out in 1961. Jack McCormack, the first national sales manager of American Honda Motor Company, said the Trail 50, and even more so the later Honda CB77, was the result of Honda's willingness to listen to and respond customer demand. \"When you talk about Japanese manufacturers, their strength (besides the quality of their equipment) was that they listened to the marketplace. People always suggest that it was about Japanese management, but, to be frank, I was never impressed with Japanese management. They did what no other motorcycle maker did—they listened.\"\n\nIn 1960, McCormack noticed that one Honda dealer in Boise, Idaho was selling more Honda 50s than the combined total of all six dealers in Los Angeles. He found out that the Idaho dealer, Herb Uhl, was selling the CA100s as a trail bike by adding knobby tires for off-road traction and a \"cheater sprocket,\" that is, increasing the final drive ratio by using a larger rear sprocket with more teeth, which increased the effective torque of the rear wheel, trading off lower top speed as a result. Uhl said the advantages of light weight and the automatic clutch allowed unskilled riders to enjoy off-road riding, in comparison to traditional big trail bikes that could be difficult to handle. McCormack shipped a version of Uhl's customized CA100 to Japan and requested Honda put it into production, and by March 1961 the Trail 50 was available to US dealers. \"Cycle World\" praised the simple pleasure of trail riding on the new bike, and it was a US sales success.\nSales for Super Cubs have increased in Japan with upgrades to the engine and the installation of fuel injection for Japanese domestic market models starting from 2007, making it more powerful, more economical and cleaner. With respect to newer, plastic body underbone designs, such as the Wave, the original Cub remains popular.\n\n\"Cycle World\" magazine's Peter Egan and Steve Kimball entered a stock Honda C70 Passport in the 1981 Craig Vetter Fuel Economy Challenge, competing against specially designed high-mileage two wheelers built by teams of engineering students, and an entry from American Honda. The course was a loop near San Luis Obispo that had to be completed in 1 hour and 40 minutes, give or take 10 minutes, meaning an average speed of . Kimball, riding the Passport, won the event through skillful and error-free riding, with .\n\nIn Vietnam, Super Cubs are the predominant model of motorcycle taxi, so that \"Honda\" has become a genericized trademark or metonymy, equivalent to \"xe ôm\" referring to any motorcycle taxi. In the English speaking world as well, \"Honda\" was often a synonym for \"motorcycle\" as a result of the ubiquity of the Super Cub.\n\nThe Super Cub was included in The Guggenheim's 1998 \"The Art of the Motorcycle\" exhibition. In 2006, on the Discovery Channel's \"The Greatest Ever\" series, an episode on motorcycles placed the 1958 49 cc Super Cub in first place. James May, a co-presenter on the popular television series \"Top Gear\", bought a Honda Super Cub for the . Author Roland Brown wrote that, \"of all the brilliant bikes Honda have built — the CB750 superbike, Mike Hailwood's six-cylinder racers, the mighty Gold Wing, you name them — the most important of all is the C100 Super Cub of 1958.\"\n\nIn 2014, the Super Cub became the first vehicle in Japan to be granted a three-dimensional trademark.\n\nIn June, 2018, Honda announced that, after an absence of 45 years, the 2019 Super Cub C125 model would once again be available in the US.\n\nChongqing Guangyu Motorcycle Manufacture Co, of China, known as Kamax, has a line of motorcycles based on the Super Cub Design, licensed from Honda, including the EEC Super Cub. This Super Cub 'remake' was developed solely for the European market in cooperation with Super Motor Company. Super Motor Company which is the sole European distributor of the EEC Super Cub sells three different variations, the Super 25, the Super 50 and the Super 100. From 2009 to 2010, Flyscooters imported a Yinxiang Super Cub variant to the US, under the name Fly Scout. Similarly, China Jialing Industrial Co., Ltd. has ten models based on Honda's Super Cub design, including the JL50Q-2 and JL90-1 which are faithful to the original 1958 styling, as well as several more modern restylings. Lifan Group exports a version to the UK, the LF100, which features telescopic forks, a four speed gearbox and a digital gear indicator.\n\nSYM Motors of Taiwan licensed the Super Cub design as the Symba 100, previously called the \"Symba 110\", which they exported to the US between 2009 and 2016. While keeping the basic design, SYM increased the size of the front brake from and added an LED fuel gauge. Instead of leading link front forks, it featured telescopic forks. The Symba engine had a carbureted single claimed to produce at 8500 rpm, with a four speed gearbox using a centrifugal clutch automated manual transmission. SYM ended the production of the Symba in 2016.\n\nAt the 2009 Tokyo Motor Show, Honda presented the EV-Cub concept vehicle, an electric motorcycle patterned after the venerable Super Cub, featuring two-wheel drive by means of electric motors mounted in the hubs of each of the wheels. Honda said they felt keeping the 1958 layout for their 21st century concept bike made sense because, \"the human body has not changed in the past 50 years,\" and, \"the size, shape and position of all the Super Cub parts had a kind of necessity to them, and that the design of the Super Cub was very rational and rider-centric.\" \n\nWithout the engine in the center of the frame or the fuel tank under the seat, there was room for a scooter-style underseat helmet compartment. Integrated with the new electric motorcycle was an interactive communications system, to let riders converse while riding. Several other companies, including Christini, KTM, Öhlins, and Yamaha have done development on two-wheel drive motorcycles, and have found that the addition of power to the front as well as the rear wheel aids in stability, particularly in corners and in the hands of novice riders. At the time Honda hinted that they would bring the EV-Cub to market in 2010. In a 2016 speech, Honda's President and CEO Takahiro Hachigo said they planned to release the EV-Cub in Japan in about two years, followed later in other ASEAN markets.\n\nThe popularity of the Super Cub and its derivatives have inspired numerous \"trail rides\" over the years, as well as \"The Biggest Little Honda Rally in the World,\" held in Reno, Nevada. The name is a play on both Reno's slogan (\"Biggest Little City in the World\") and on the Wilson/Love song \"Little Honda\". \n\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> The Chinese Flying Pigeon bicycle, with on the order of 500 million in service as of 2007, is the most produced vehicle ever.

Malcolm Danare, Kevin Dunn and Michael Lerner reprise their roles from the film.\n\nThe series follows the Humanitarian Environmental (or Ecological, in \"Area 51\") Analysis Team (HEAT), a research team led by Dr. Nick Tatopoulos (voiced by Ian Ziering) as they battle giant mutant monsters that frequently appear in the wake of the events depicted in the 1998 film \"Godzilla\". Dr. Tatopoulos accidentally discovers an egg that survived the aerial bombardment before it hatches, in a minor change from the ending in the 1998 film. The creature hatches after Nick Tatopoulos stumbles onto it and it assumes him to be its parent. Subsequently, Dr. Tatopoulos and his associates form a research team, investigating strange occurrences and defending mankind from dangerous mutations. Godzilla (also known as Zilla Junior), the only hatchling of its species to survive in the movie, imprints on Nick and becomes the main weapon summoned against the other mutations encountered by the human characters. The series also introduces two new characters: Monique Dupre, a French secret agent assigned by Philippe Roache to keep an eye on Godzilla and H.E.A.T., and Randy Hernandez, an intern of Nick's who specializes in computer hacking.\n\n\n\n\nColumbia TriStar Home Video released two separate episode collections on VHS: \"Trouble Hatches\", composed of the two-part pilot episode (which was actually titled \"New Family\" when it first aired), and \"Monster War\", featuring the three-part episode of the same name. In 2006, Sony released nine episodes on DVD, spread out onto three separate volumes: \"The Monster Wars Trilogy\", consisting of the same three-part episode previously released on the VHS version, \"Monster Mayhem\", which included \"What Dreams May Come\", \"Bird of Paradise\", and \"Deadloch\", and \"Mutant Madness\", which contained \"S.C.A.L.E.\", \"The Twister\" and \"Where Is Thy Sting?\".\n\nIn 2006, Sony released the \"Monster Edition\" DVD of \"Godzilla\" (1998), featuring three episodes of the TV series: \"What Dreams May Come\", \"Monster War: Part 1\" and \"Where Is Thy Sting?\". In 2014, Mill Creek Entertainment released the complete series on DVD in North America, including the two unaired episodes. The episodes were released in chronological order, not the broadcast order.\n\nThe series did well during Fox Kids' Saturday morning line-up. Ultimately, however, it was overshadowed by the late 1990s \"Pokémon\"/\"Digimon\" war between Kids' WB and Fox Kids during the 1999-2000 season. As a result, \"Godzilla: The Series\" was placed in different timeslots on Saturdays to accommodate many of the \"Digimon\" marathons and back-to-back episodes (this would affect other Fox Kids shows as well). For a brief period of time, episodes of \"Godzilla: The Series\" were either never repeated, or skipped over and rescheduled. There was a brief period where the show was taken off the schedule to accommodate new shows for midseason, resulting in two episodes that were never broadcast in the U.S.\n\nThe series was more positively received by fans than the film it was based on, being considered more faithful to the original Godzilla that fans were familiar with.\n\nTwo video games were released for the Game Boy Color. They were developed by Crawfish Interactive and published by Crave Entertainment. \"Godzilla: The Series\" was released in 1999 and \"Godzilla: The Series - Monster Wars\" was released in 2000.\n\n\n"}

While the programme prepares students for the IB Middle Years Programme, it is not a prerequisite for it. The subject areas of the PYP are language, social studies, mathematics, science and technology, arts, and personal, social and physical education. Students are required to learn a second language during the programme. Assessment is carried out by teachers according to strategies provided by the IB, and with respect to guidelines to what the students should learn specified in the curriculum model.\n\nThe programme was created by a group of international school educators (Kevin Bartlett of the Vienna International School, Paul Lieblich of Lyford Cay International School, Robert Landau of the Commonwealth American School of Lausanne, Susan Stengal of the Copenhagen International School and Ian Sayer of The British School of Lomé and Peter Harding of the International School Hamburg, who wished to create a non-national based \"best practice\" educational framework for international schools. This group formed the International Schools Curriculum Project (3-12) which received funding from original member schools and through the IBO from Shell Oil's international education division. After several years of development and increasing popularity the Steering Committee voted 5 to 6 to hand the \"project\" over to the IBO for management and continuing development.)\n\nThe philosophy of the PYP is to make the students into \"inquirers, thinkers, communicators, risk takers, knowledgeable, principled, caring, open-minded, well-balanced, and reflective.\"\n\nThere are 10 attributes in the IB learner profile. PYP documents describe the PYP student profile as \"the common ground on which PYP schools stand, the essence of what they are about\" (Making the PYP Happen, 2000).\nThrough the programmes the students should develop these traits. These traits originated in the PYP where it was called the \"PYP student profile,\" but since the practitioners thought learning should not come to a stop at age 11, they carried these attributes through to the completion of the diploma programmes; therefore, it is now called the \"IB Learner Profile.\"\nThe learner profile illustrates the qualities of an internationally minded person and a lifelong learner.\n\nFrom the International Baccalaureate Organization 2007: Participant Workbook, Introduction to the PYP, the following is what IB learners strive to be:\n\n\nIn the IBPYP the written curriculum is arranged within six \"transdisciplinary themes\". While the themes are universal and applicable to all cultures, the expectation is that there are certain core values, skills and knowledge for international schools, students and educators. For example, the international school curriculum should have “global significance—for all students in all cultures.\"\n\nWho we are: An inquiry into the nature of the self; beliefs and values; personal, physical, mental, social and spiritual health; human relationships including families, friends, communities, and cultures; rights and responsibilities; what it means to be human.\n\nWhere we are in place and time: An inquiry into orientation in place and time; personal histories; homes and journeys; the discoveries, explorations and migrations of humankind; the relationships between and the interconnections of individuals and civilizations, from local and global perspectives.\n\nHow we express ourselves: An inquiry into the ways in which we discover and express ideas, feelings, nature, culture, beliefs and values; the ways in which we reflect on, extend and enjoy our creativity; our appreciation of the aesthetic.\n\nHow the world works: An inquiry into the natural world and its laws; the interaction between the natural world (physical and biological) and human societies; how humans use their understanding of scientific principles; the impact of scientific and technological advances on society and on the environment.\n\nHow we organize ourselves: An inquiry into the interconnections of human-made systems and communities; the structure and function of organizations; societal decision-making; economic activities and their impact on humankind and the environment.\n\nSharing the planet: An inquiry into rights and responsibilities in the struggle to share finite resources with other people and with other living things; communities and the relationships within and between them; access to equal opportunities; peace and conflict resolution.\n\nIn order to participate in the IB Primary Years Programme, students must attend an authorised IB World School. \"A PYP school is expected to implement the programme in an inclusive manner, so that all students in all the grades/year levels in the school or in the primary division of a school are engaged fully with the PYP.\" IB's requirement that the PYP must be implemented schoolwide has resulted in controversy in American public schools where parents cite lack of choice.\n\n"}

{"id": "1983243", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1983243", "title": "IB Middle Years Programme", "text": "IB Middle Years Programme\n\nThe International Baccalaureate Middle Years Programme (MYP) is an educational program for students between the ages of 11 to 16 around the world as part of the International Baccalaureate (IB) continuum. MYP is intended to prepare students for the two-year IB Diploma Programme (IBDP).\n\nIn the MYP, students are required to receive instruction in all 8 subject groups; Language Acquisition, Language and Literature, Individuals and Societies, Sciences, Mathematics, Arts, Physical and Health Education, and Design. Typically, a student must receive at least 50 hours of instruction in all 8 subject groups every year. However, with permission from the IB, schools can acquire curriculum flexibility to only require 6 of the 8 subject areas during the final two years of the MYP. The full program lasts 5 years although shorter programs, lasting two, three, or four years, can be adopted with permission from the IB. There are many requirements that must be fulfilled in order for a school to offer MYP, such as receiving authorization from the IB, having sufficient funding, and finding teachers that are willing and able to commit to the additional demands (e.g., completing ongoing IB teacher trainings and complying with the structured curriculum).\n\nA core part of IB MYP is community service. The community and service area requires students to study and perform community studies and service throughout the program. Some schools and districts, like the Upper St. Clair School District and Montgomery County Public Schools (Maryland) either require or highly encourage a set number of hours of community service to be completed by each student, while schools like Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools and Round Rock Independent School District require students to complete the \"Community Project\" for students to complete the program during Year 3 or 4.\n\nThe program is based on six Global Contexts. Global Contexts are considered a key feature of the MYP. They are not generally taught as separate courses, but rather as themes that are reflected in all subjects through unit questions.\n\nIn addition to the eight subject groups, in MYP 5, students complete a long-term project (the personal project) on a topic of their choice, with teacher supervision (this is also graded with its own separate criteria). Students in MYP 3-4 complete the community project.\n\nMYP documentation is available in English, French, Spanish, Russian and Chinese.\n\nThe subjects taught in the MYP are divided into eight subject groups.\n\nSchools can choose the subjects they teach within each subject group and how many. However, each subject group must receive a minimum of 50 hours of curriculum time each academic year. In years 4 and 5, schools can request to only require students to receive 50-hours of instruction in six of the eight subject groups. A student could take another \"Language and Literature\" course if they have sufficient proficiency in both (In MYP4&5 this could replace the Language Acquisition course). Schools are given much flexibility to allow them to introduce subjects they consider important and organize their own student assessment and reporting procedures. However, the MYP gives clear criteria for each subject group. The criteria get progressively harder with the first year of MYP using the MYP1 criteria, then the second and third year using the MYP3 criteria and finally the last two years using the MYP5 criteria. Each year, MYP students participate in one interdisciplinary that combines at least two of the subject groups; there is a separate criterion for interdisciplinary learning.\n\nThe MYP Certificate is the highest award available in MYP. In 2016, the MYP eAssessments will be the new form of the optional external moderation. To receive the MYP Certificate, each candidate must complete at least one eAssessment in:\nThe subject with the highest level, within each bullet point above, will be put on the certificate, to be added to create a total out of 56. The pass requirements is that, each group must have a subject with at least a level 3, the total must add to 28 and the candidate must meet the Service and Actions requirements set by the school.\nSubjects may be added after the 2016 examinations.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>May not be offered in French or Spanish (all other subjects are)\n\n<nowiki>**</nowiki>Spanish only has interdisciplinary examination in sciences\n\nEach subject group uses 4 criteria to mark a student's ability in the subject. At the end of the year, teachers give a final score, out of 8, on each criterion based on the student's performance throughout the whole year. The scores of the 4 criteria are added up and converted to a grade out of 7. This grade is meant to demonstrate the student's overall ability in the subject, with 1 being the lowest achievement and 7 the highest achievement.\n\nLanguage and Literature\nLanguage Acquisition\nIndividuals and Societies\nSciences\nMathematics\nThe Arts\nPhysical and Health Education\nDesign \nInterdisciplinary learning\nPersonal Project\n\nAt the center of the MYP is the IB Learner Profile, which defines the type of students all the IB programmes (PYP, MYP, and DP) are intended to develop.\n\n\nThere are six Global Contexts (GCs) which are applied to every course the student takes. They are designed to help students recognize the connection between what they learn in the classroom and the world around them, to tie the various subject areas together, and eventually to help students \"see knowledge as an interrelated, coherent whole.\"\n\nThe GCs should be linked to every topic they learned in class and every assessment they do.\n\nThe Global Contexts are as follows:\n\n\nThe \"Personal Project\" a culmination of student learning and a focus of the areas of interaction. Just as with the extended essay in the IB Diploma Programme, students are required to choose an academic or non-academic topic or subject for their project, which they are expected to complete over the course of the school year. Students are required to keep a \"personal journal\" while working on the process, and schedule regular meetings with an MYP teacher who will serve as their advisor throughout the year; in addition, a final reflection must be written upon the completion of the project which explains how it ties in with at least one of the Global Contexts. To get the MYP certificate, the candidate must get at least 3 out of 7 in the final score.\n\nIn order to officially participate in an official IB Middle Years Program, students must attend an authorised IB World School. In the U.S., the program is often taught throughout middle school and the first two years of high school. Typically, middle schools and high schools work in coordination with each other.\n\nThe application process, taking 1.5 to 3+ years, to become an IB World School with the MYP can total as much as US$23,000, with additional costs for teacher training, annual fees, and test fees.\n\nThe IB publishes candidate fees of US$9500 per year, and US$8920 per year once authorized. Schools are also required to involve their teachers in IB-sponsored professional development, which can cost as much as US$729 per course.\n\nWithin the United States, the IB curriculum has been criticized as \"non-American\" and \"non-Judeo-Christian\", and for promoting international declarations not endorsed by the U.S. government, such as the Kyoto Protocol and the Earth Charter. In an interview published in \"IB World\" magazine, IB was praised for converting students from \"national citizens\" to \"global citizens\". The Ambrose School, a Christian academy in Idaho, stated: \"classical education bases itself in the traditional Western Christian ideal of Truth, Goodness, and Beauty. The IB pursues a postmodern view of tolerance and relativism.\" In 2012, the New Hampshire Republican Party stated in its platform that it would \"oppose laws and programs contrary to our founding principles such as Sharia Law, the International Baccalaureate Program, UN Agenda 21 or other 'sustainable development' programs.\"\n\nThe \"Chicago Tribune\" reported that in 1998 in that city's Beverly neighborhood, only 67 students in the 8th grade chose to attend the local public high school, which offered an IB program. After a cluster of Beverly schools began the IB Middle Years Program in the 1999–2000 school year, the number of neighborhood 8th graders who chose to attend the local high school increased to about 150. One student was quoted, \"I had really good teachers in the IB program.\"\n\nA prospectus published in 2007 by Denver Public Schools (DPS) stated:There is no available evidence that the IB will increase student achievement in DPS schools or that the IB has had a positive effect on student achievement in similar districts or schools. A thorough search of the literature has netted no empirical studies on the effects of IB on student achievement. The IB, itself, publishes no such results.\n\nIn 2011, Greenwich Public Schools reported that they were not able to indicate an improvement in test results at their IB school.\n\nIn 2015, teachers at an elementary school in the South Orange-Maplewood School District in New Jersey appealed to their employer to stop funding the IB Middle Years program at their school because \"it was bringing no added value, was wasting their time and that of their students, and was bleeding resources from the district that were sorely needed elsewhere\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1983252", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1983252", "title": "Peter Hurkos", "text": "Peter Hurkos\n\nPeter Hurkos (born Pieter van der Hurk on 21 May 1911 in Dordrecht, the Netherlands; died 1 June 1988 in Los Angeles, California) was a Dutchman who allegedly manifested extrasensory perception (ESP) after recovering from a head injury and coma caused by a fall from a ladder when aged 30. He came to the United States in 1956 for psychic experiments, later becoming a professional psychic who sought clues in the Manson Family murders and the Boston Strangler case. With the help of businessman Henry Belk and parapsychologist Andrija Puharich, Hurkos became a popular entertainer known for performing psychic feats before live and television audiences.\n\nHurkos stated in a 1960 episode of the television series \"\", after giving a lecture at Massachusetts Institute of Technology to a scientific panel, that he would participate in any scientific experiment under any circumstances. However, author and stage magician James Randi contends that Hurkos refused to allow his skill to be tested by scientists except for one session with the parapsychologist Charles Tart of the University of California, Davis. Dr. Tart's tests were negative. Randi commented \"If Tart can't find such powers, they certainly aren't there!\".\n\nThe parapsychologist Andrija Puharich was impressed by the stories about Hurkos and invited him to the USA in 1956 to investigate his alleged psychic abilities. Hurkos was studied at Puharich's Glen Cove, Maine, medical research laboratory under what Dr. Puharich considered to be controlled conditions. The results convinced Puharich that Hurkos had genuine psychic abilities. However the experiments were not repeated by other scientists and Puharich was described as a \"credulous investigator\". Raymond Buckland has written \"with the exception of Dr. Andrija Puharich, not a single recognized psychic investigator has been impressed with Hurkos's performances.\"\n\nDuring his early career as a psychic entertainer, Hurkos purported that he employed his psychic powers to discern details of audience members' private lives that he could not otherwise have known. However, the psychologist Ronald Schwartz wrote in the magazine \"Skeptical Inquirer\" that Hurkos used cold reading methods and published a transcription of such a reading in their autumn 1978 issue.\n\nJames Randi analyzed this and other transcripts of Hurkos performances and professed to have identified a number of standard cold reading techniques. For example, Hurkos might begin with something seemingly personal but actually quite common: a surgery. Hurkos would not specify that the subject underwent surgery—it could be any recent surgery of personal relevance to the subject. If this method failed, Randi maintains, Hurkos would qualify the statement with the phrase \"long time ago.\" At this point, any operation to any family member or friend in the subjects's own life would have seemed psychic because an operation is thought of as a private matter. Randi adds that the tone in Hurkos's voice was also significant: Hurkos presented himself as confident and knowing and characterized the subject as obstinate.\n\nOther common techniques included guessing numbers of people in families (easy enough if one picks a typical number and allows himself to add frequent visitors or exclude family members who have relocated away from home as needed to match the target, as Hurkos did), including nonsense words in his presentation that could be interpreted by the subject to have any one of many meanings, and guessing on the importance of common names, which could be permutated as needed. (He most commonly used the name \"Ann,\" which would give him a success with anybody who had a relative or friend or teacher or boss or co-worker named Ann, Anna, Anastasia, etc., at any time in his or her life.)\n\nHurkos and his supporters maintained that he was a great psychic detective. In 1964, Attorney General Edward W. Brooke of Massachusetts said Hurkos had come <nowiki>\"uncannily close\"</nowiki> to describing the person suspected in the Boston Strangler case. By 1969, he cited the successful solution of 27 murder cases in 17 countries. However, in some cases the detectives assigned to these cases countered that Hurkos contributed no information unobtainable from newspapers and, in some cases, that he had no part in the investigations whatsoever. In response to Hurkos's claim that he located the stolen \"Stone of Scone,\" Home Secretary Chuter Ede declared:\nThe gentleman in question whose activities have been publicized (though not by the police) was among a number of persons authorized to come to Westminster Abbey to examine the scene of the crime. He was not invited by the police, his expenses have not been refunded by the Government, and he did not obtain any result whatsoever.\n\nHurkos made notable claims contrary to popular belief such as the claim that Adolf Hitler was alive and living in Argentina. \n\nIn 1964, Hurkos was put on trial on the charge of impersonating a federal agent, found guilty, and fined $1,000. Hurkos posed as the police officer in order to gather information that he could later claim to be psychic revelations.\n\nIn the case of murderer John Norman Collins, he sometimes claimed the killer was blond and at other times brown-haired so that he could claim victory either way. He claimed to have identified Charles Manson to police; Manson was also identified by his devotee Susan Atkins to a cellmate while she was in jail for a different crime. In fact, Hurkos had been to the Tate residence to do a \"reading,\" but his guesses, including descriptions of how the \"killings erupted during a black magic ritual known as 'goona goona,'\" were inaccurate.\n\nThe magician Milbourne Christopher in his book \"Mediums, Mystics and the Occult\" documented the errors Hurkos had made.\n\nAuthors Arthur Lyons and Marcello Truzzi Ph.D., also a founder of the International Remote Viewing Association, wrote the Hurkos cases were \"pure bunk\" in their 1991 book \"The Blue Sense: Psychic Detectives and Crime.\"\n\nDespite refutations, Hurkos remained famous. He has had several successful television specials, including:\n\n\nA story about Hurkos' alleged psychic powers entitled \"The Man With The X-Ray Mind\" appears in Frank Edwards' 1959 book \"Stranger Than Science\" (Citadel)\n\nNumerous periodicals reported Hurkos's exploits throughout his lifetime: \"Time\", \"Newsweek\", \"Omni\", \"Life\", \"True\", \"Reader's Digest\", \"Playboy\", \"The National Enquirer\", \"Ladies Home Journal\", et al. Hurkos himself published three books: \"Psychic\" (Bobbs-Merrill) and \"Peter Hurkos: I Have Many Lives\" (Doubleday). \"The Psychic World of Peter Hurkos\", (Doubleday), was written by Norma Lee Browning. Various authors have described and examined various details of Hurkos's life and alleged ESP in more than 75 published books.\n\nHe also appeared in several motion pictures as himself, including \"The Amazing World of Psychic Phenomena\" (Sunn International), \"The Mysterious Monsters\" (David Wolper), and \"Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep\" (Paramount). George Voskovec portrayed Hurkos in \"The Boston Strangler\", the 1968 movie adaptation of Gerold Frank's 1966 book of the same name. His life may also have been the basis for the 1979 Stephen King novel \"The Dead Zone\".\n\nAt the time of his death, Peter Hurkos resided in Studio City, Los Angeles. He failed to predict accurately the date of his own death: Although he prophesied that he would die on 17 November 1961, he did not die until 1 June 1988, at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in West Hollywood, California. He was survived by his wife, Stephany Courtney, their daughter, and six children from a previous marriage, including a daughter from his second marriage (Carola Van der Hurk KNA Carol Donovan who lives in Lebanon, Ohio) and a daughter from his third marriage, Gloria, who resides in San Diego, California.\n\n\n\n"}

His father had emigrated to Australia from Leeds, UK as a young man.\n\nHe turned professional in 1992 and was successful almost immediately, topping the PGA Tour of Australasia Order of Merit in his first season and again in 1994. He continues to play some events on his home tour and has won 13 events on it, including one as an amateur. He also began to play on the European Tour and it was his principal tour until 1998. He won four tournaments on it, including three in 1996, when he finished third on the Order of Merit. He has featured in the top 20 of the Official World Golf Rankings.\n\nAllenby now plays primarily in the U.S. on the PGA Tour. He earned exempt status for 1999 by finishing 17th at the 1998 Qualifying School. He had a disappointing first season in America, coming 126th on the money list, but came good in 2000 when he won the Shell Houston Open and the Advil Western Open. He claimed another pair of wins the following season. In both of those years he came 16th on the money list. He has not won since but finished in the top 50 each year from 2002–2004. His performances in the major championships have been somewhat disappointing; his highest placing in a major is tied seventh at the 2004 U.S. Open. In 2005 he became the first golfer to win the \"triple crown\" of the Australian Masters, Australian PGA and Australian Open in the same year.\n\nAllenby played for the International Team in the Presidents Cup in 1994, 1996, 2000, 2003 and 2009. After posting a 2–2–1 record in the 2009 Presidents Cup, Allenby accused Anthony Kim of being ill-prepared for his Sunday singles match, in which Allenby lost 5 and 3. In December 2009 Allenby became the first Australian to win the Nedbank Golf Challenge in South Africa, defeating Henrik Stenson in a playoff. It was his first professional win in four years, but he did not have to wait long for the next as he returned home to claim his fourth Australian PGA Championship title the following week.\n\nAllenby missed the cut in the 2011 Masters Tournament by one stroke after bogeying the 18th hole of the second round. In February 2012, Allenby missed an opportunity to end an eleven-year drought on the PGA Tour, when he took a two stroke advantage to the 72nd hole of the Mayakoba Golf Classic. He hit his tee shot into the trees on the right and proceeded to make double bogey to fall into a playoff with rookie John Huh. He lost out at the eighth extra hole when he could only bogey the par three 10th, leaving Huh with a tap in par for the tournament. Both players had made par on all seven previous holes throughout the playoff until this point.\n\nAllenby is a patron and spokesperson for Challenge Cancer Support Network, which has raised more than $9 million since 1993 for children with cancer and blood disorders. He resides in Jupiter, Florida. On 22 June 2000, Allenby was awarded the Australian Sports Medal.\n\nStatements Allenby made at the 2009 and 2011 Presidents Cups generated controversy. In 2009, following a loss to American Anthony Kim in the Sunday singles, Allenby accused Kim of partying all night on the eve of the Singles matches. That statement was vehemently denied by Kim and the members of the American team. In 2011, following a 0–4–0 record at the Presidents Cup where he failed to gain any points for the International team, he asserted that his record wasn't completely his fault and cited his partners' poor play as a reason. His partners, including Geoff Ogilvy, were displeased with Allenby's comments.\n\nThe following week, at the Australian PGA Championship, Allenby got into contention which resulted in Ogilvy making a tweet that Allenby perceived as being sarcastic. After the tournament ended, Allenby exchanged heated words with Ogilvy and came close to having a physical altercation with Ogilvy.\n\nIn July 2015 at the RBC Canadian Open, Allenby had a verbal altercation with his caddie, Mick Middlemo, after playing four holes. While Allenby says that he was verbally abused and threatened by Middlemo, Middlemo says Allenby was verbally abusive. Middlemo walked off the course and Allenby selected a school principal from the gallery to carry his clubs the rest of the round. Later reports from another caddy in the group, Simon Clarke, seemed to indicate the problem was with Allenby. \"I've known Rob for a long time and I've known Mick for a long time,\" Clarke said. \"It's disappointing that at age 42, or however old he [Allenby] is, he's still treating people that way and how many good caddies he's gone through.\n\nOn 17 January 2015, after missing the cut at the Sony Open in Hawaii, Allenby was at a bar in Honolulu, Hawaii, when he says he was kidnapped, robbed and beaten, before being dumped in a park several miles away. An arrest was made concerning the false use of Allenby's credit card for adult entertainment purposes.

{"id": "1983262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1983262", "title": "IB Diploma Programme", "text": "IB Diploma Programme\n\nThe International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) is a two-year educational programme primarily aimed at 16-to-19-year-olds. The programme provides an internationally accepted qualification for entry into higher education and is recognized by many universities worldwide. It was developed in the early to mid-1960s in Geneva, Switzerland, by a group of international educators. After a six-year pilot programme that ended in 1975, a bilingual diploma was established.\n\nAdministered by the International Baccalaureate (IB), the IBDP is taught in schools in over 140 countries, in one of three languages: English, French, or Spanish. In order to participate, students must attend an IB school. IBDP students complete assessments in six subjects, one from each subject group, and three core requirements. Students are evaluated using both internal and external assessments, and courses finish with an externally assessed series of examinations, usually consisting of two or three timed written tests. Internal assessment varies by subject: there may be oral presentations, practical work, or written work. In most cases, these are initially graded by the classroom teacher, whose grades are then verified or modified, as necessary, by an appointed external moderator.\n\nGenerally, the IBDP has been well received. It has been commended for introducing interdisciplinary thinking to students. In the United Kingdom, \"The Guardian\" newspaper claims that the IBDP is \"more academically challenging and broader than three or four A-levels\".\n\nIn 1945 the \"Conference of Internationally-minded Schools\" asked the International School of Geneva (Ecolint) to create an international schools programme. When he became director of Ecolint's English division, Desmond Cole-Baker began to develop the idea, and in 1962, his colleague Robert Leach organised a conference in Geneva, at which the term \"International Baccalaureate\" was first mentioned. An American social studies teacher, Leach organized the conference—with a $2500 grant from UNESCO—which was attended by observers from European schools and UNESCO. Writing about the genesis of the International Baccalaureate in \"Schools Across Frontiers\", Alec Peterson credits Leach as \"the original promoter of the International Baccalaureate.\" At the end of the conference, Unesco funded the International School Association with an additional $10,000, which was inadequate to do more than produce a few papers, or bring teachers together for meetings.\nBy 1964, international educators such as Alec Peterson (director of the Department of Education at Oxford University), Harlan Hanson (director of the College Board Advanced Placement Program), Desmond Cole (director of United Nations International School in New York) and Desmond Cole-Baker (head of the International School of Geneva) founded the International Schools Examination Syndicate (ISES). Cole and Hanson brought experience with college entrance examinations in the United States, and Hanson, in particular, brought his experience from a long relationship with the College Board. According to Peterson, \"the breakthrough in the history of the IB\" came in 1965 with a grant from the Twentieth Century Fund, which commissioned Martin Mayer, author of \"The Schools\", to produce a report on the feasibility of establishing a common curriculum and examination for international schools that would be acceptable for entry to universities worldwide. This led to conferences involving Ecolint, United World College of the Atlantic (UWC Atlantic College), and others in the spring and fall of 1965, at which details about the curriculum for the Diploma Programme were discussed and agreed upon.\n\nThe Ford Foundation grant, secured in 1966, funded Peterson's study at Oxford University, which focused on three issues: a comparative analysis of \"secondary educational programmes in European countries...in cooperation with the Council of Europe\"; university expectations for secondary students intending to enter university; and a \"statistical comparison of IB pilot examination results with...national school leaving examinations such as British A Levels and US College Board (AP) Tests\". As a result of the study and the curriculum model developed at UWC Atlantic College, Peterson initiated the pattern of combining \"general education with specialization\", which melded with the curricula of the United States and Canada, and became the \"curriculum framework\" proposed at the UNESCO conference in Geneva in 1967. Late in 1967, ISES was restructured and renamed the IB Council of Foundation, and John Goormaghtigh became the first president in January 1968. In 1967, the group, which by then also included Ralph Tyler, identified eight schools to be used for the experimentation of the curriculum.\n\nIn 1968, the IB headquarters were officially established in Geneva for the development and maintenance of the IBDP. Alec Peterson became IBO's first director general, and in 1968, twelve schools in twelve countries participated in the IBDP, including UWC Atlantic College and UNIS of New York. The aim was to \"provide an internationally acceptable university admissions qualification suitable for the growing mobile population of young people whose parents were part of the world of diplomacy, international and multi-national organizations.\"\n\nThe first six years of the IB Diploma Programme, with a limited number of students, are referred to as the \"experimental period\". Each school was to be inspected by ISES or IBO and had to be approved by their government. The experimental period ended in 1975, and in that year, the International Baccalaureate North America (IBNA) was established as a separate entity, allowing the funding for implementation of the IBDP to remain in the country rather than being sent to Geneva. The first official guide to the programme containing its syllabus and official assessment information was published in 1970 and included the theory of knowledge course. The extended essay was introduced in 1978, but creativity, action, service (CAS), although mentioned in guides beforehand, was not specifically identified in the guide until 1989.\n\nIn 1980, responding to criticism that the \"internationalism\" was Eurocentric, the IB hosted a seminar in Singapore with the goal of incorporating Asian culture and education into the IB curriculum. In 1982, the Standing Conference of Heads of IB Schools took steps to modify the Eurocentrism in the curriculum. The same year, the Japanese government hosted a science conference for IBO \"as a token of Japanese interest in the various dimensions of the IB\".\n\nFrom the start, all subjects of the IB Diploma Programme were available in English and French, and it was mandatory for all students to study both a first and a second language. In 1974, bilingual diplomas were introduced that allowed students to take one or more of their humanities or science subjects in a language other than their first. The IB Diploma Programme subjects became available in Spanish in 1983.\n\nTo be awarded an IB diploma, candidates must fulfill three core requirements, in addition to passing their subject examinations:\n\n\nStudents who pursue the IB diploma must take six subjects: one each from Groups 1–5, and either one from Group 6 or a permitted substitute from one of the other groups, as described below. Three or four subjects must be taken at Higher level (HL) and the rest at Standard level (SL). The IB recommends a minimum of 240 hours of instructional time for HL courses and 150 hours for SL courses.\n\nWhile the IB encourages students to pursue the full IB diploma, the \"substantial workload require[s] a great deal of commitment, organization, and initiative\". Students may instead choose to register for one or more individual IB subjects, without the core requirements. Such students will not receive the full diploma.\n\nThe six IBDP subject groups and course offerings are summarised below. More information about the subject groups and individual courses can be found at the respective subject group articles:\n\n\nEnvironmental Systems and Societies SL is an interdisciplinary course designed to meet the diploma requirements for groups 3 and 4, while Literature and Performance SL meets the requirements of Groups 1 and 6.\n\nThe IB is developing a pilot online version of the IBDP and currently offers several online courses to IBDP students. Eventually, it expects to offer online courses to any student who wishes to register. Additionally, the IB has developed pilot courses that include World Religions; Sports, Exercise and Health Sciences, Dance, and a transdisciplinary pilot course, Literature and Performance, Global Politics. These pilot courses have now become part of the mainstream courses.\n\nAll subjects (with the exception of CAS) are evaluated using both internal and external assessors. The externally assessed examinations are given worldwide in May (usually for Northern Hemisphere schools) and in November (usually for Southern Hemisphere schools). Each exam usually consists of two or three papers, generally written on the same or successive weekdays. The different papers may have different forms of questions, or they may focus on different areas of the subject syllabus. For example, in Chemistry SL, paper 1 has multiple choice questions, paper 2 has extended response questions. Paper 3 focuses on the \"Option(s)\" selected by the teacher and data analysis questions. The grading of all external assessments is done by independent examiners appointed by the IB.\n\nThe nature of the internal assessment (IA) varies by subject. There may be oral presentations (used in languages), practical work (in experimental sciences and performing arts), or written work. Internal assessment accounts for 20 to 50 percent of the mark awarded for each subject and is marked by a teacher in the school. A sample of at least five per subject at each level from a school will also be graded by a moderator appointed by the IB, in a process called external moderation of internal assessment. Based on this moderation, the grades of the whole subject from that school will change.\n\nPoints are awarded from 1 to 7, with 7 being equal to A*, 6 equal to A, and so on. Up to three additional points are awarded depending on the grades achieved in the extended essay and theory of knowledge, so the maximum possible point total in the IBDP is 45. The global pass rate for the IB diploma is approximately 80%. In order to receive an IB diploma, candidates must receive a minimum of 24 points or an average of four (or C) out of a possible seven points for six subjects. Candidates must also receive a minimum of 12 points from their Higher Level subjects and a minimum of 9 points from their Standard Level subjects. Additionally, candidates must complete all of the requirements for the EE, CAS and TOK. Failing conditions that will prevent a student from being awarded a diploma, regardless of points received, are non-completion of CAS, more than three scores of 3 or below, not meeting the specific points required for Higher Level or Standard Level subjects, or plagiarism in addition to scoring higher than a score of 1 in any subject/level.\n\nCandidates who successfully complete all the requirements of the IB Diploma Programme and one or more of the following combinations are eligible to receive a bilingual diploma: two Group 1 subjects (of different languages), a Group 3 or 4 subject taken in a language other than the candidate's Group 1 language, or an Extended Essay in a Group 3 or Group 4 subject written in a language other than the candidate's Group 1 language. IB certificates are issued to indicate completion of diploma courses and exams for non-diploma candidate students.\n\nWhere standard assessment conditions could put a student with special educational needs at a disadvantage, special arrangements may be allowed. The \"Candidates with Special Assessment Needs \"publication contains information regarding procedures and arrangements for students with special needs.\n\nTo offer the IB Diploma Programme, an institution must go through an application process, and during that period the teachers are trained in the IB. At the end of the application process, IB conducts an authorisation visit.\nOnce a school is authorised to offer the programme, an annual fee ensures ongoing support from the IB, legal authorisation to display the IB logo, and access to the Online Curriculum Centre (OCC) and the IB Information System (IBIS). The OCC provides information, resources, and support for IB teachers and coordinators. IBIS is a database employed by IB coordinators. Other IB fees also include student registration and individual diploma subject examination fees.\n\nThe IB diploma is accepted in 75 countries at over 2,000 universities, and the IB has a search directory on its website, although it advises students to check recognition policies directly with each university. The IB also maintains a list of universities offering scholarships to IBDP graduates under conditions specified by each institution, including 58 colleges and universities in the United States. The following is an overview of university recognition policies in various countries.\nThe IBDP was described as \"a rigorous, off-the-shelf curriculum recognized by universities around the world\" in the 10 December 2006, edition of \"Time\" magazine, in an article titled \"How to bring our schools out of the 20th century\". It was also featured in the summer 2002 edition of \"American Educator,\" where Robert Rothman described it as \"a good example of an effective, instructionally sound, exam-based system\". Howard Gardner, a professor of educational psychology at Harvard University, said that the IBDP curriculum is \"less parochial than most American efforts\" and helps students \"think critically, synthesize knowledge, reflect on their own thought processes and get their feet wet in interdisciplinary thinking\". An admissions officer at Brown University claims the IBDP garners widespread respect.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the IBDP is \"regarded as more academically challenging but broader than three or four A-levels\", according to an article in the \"Guardian\". In 2006, government ministers provided funding so that \"every local authority in England could have at least one centre offering sixth-formers the chance to do the IB\". In 2008, Children's Secretary Ed Balls abandoned a \"flagship Tony Blair pledge to allow children in all areas to study IB\". Fears of a \"two-tier\" education system further dividing education between the rich and the poor emerged as the growth in IB is driven by private schools and sixth-form colleges.\n\nIn the United States, criticism of the IBDP has centered on the vague claim that it is anti-American, according to parents anonymously quoted in \"The New York Times\", who objected to the program's funding from UNESCO in its early years. The base cost is considered to be higher than other programs. In 2012, the school board in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, voted to eliminate all IB programmes in the district because of low participation and high costs. \n\n\n"}

In 1783 he was a joint founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.\n\nMontgomery was born at Macbie Hill in Peeblesshire in October 1721, the second son of William Montgomery, Sheriff-Depute of Peeblesshire, of Coldcoat or Macbie Hill, Peeblesshire. His mother was Barbara Rutherford, daughter of Robert Rutherford of Bowland, Stow, Midlothian. In Edinburgh he resided at Queensberry House on the Royal Mile and was its last resident as a private house. Here he famously had a black servant named \"Hannibal\".\n\nAfter schooling at the parish school at West Linton, Montgomery studied law at the University of Edinburgh, and was called to the Scottish bar on 19 February 1743. In 1748, after heritable jurisdictions had been abolished, he was appointed the first sheriff of Peebles under the new system. On 30 April 1760, thanks to the influence of his friend Robert Dundas, then newly appointed lord president, he succeeded Sir Thomas Miller, Lord Glenlee as Solicitor General for Scotland jointly with Francis Garden (1721–1793). In 1764, he became sole solicitor-general, and in 1766 Lord Advocate in succession to Miller, to whose parliamentary seat for the Dumfries Burghs he succeeded also.\n\nBut at the general election of 1768, Montgomery was returned for Peeblesshire, a seat which he retained till he was raised to the bench. A learned lawyer and an improving landlord, he was peculiarly fitted to deal with the question of entails, which had now become pressing, owing to the extent to which details fettered the practical management of land. The existing statute was Sir George Mackenzie's Act of 1685, and since it passed 485 deeds of entail had been registered under it. The public demanded a reform ; the Faculty of Advocates had passed resolutions approving it. Montgomery accordingly introduced a measure in March 1770, which passed into law (10 Geo. Ill, c. 51) and considerably enlarged the powers of the heir of an entail in respect of leasing and improving the entailed lands, and even provided for the exchange of land in spite of an entail.\nThough he remained in parliament, Montgomery took little further interest in its proceedings after the passage of his bill. In June 1775, he was created Lord Chief Baron of the Scottish Exchequer, and in 1781 he was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland; he resigned his judgeship in April 1801. In July 1801, he was created a Baronet.\nMontgomery was, like his father, skilled in farming, and in 1763 bought a half-reclaimed estate of Lord Islay's in Peeblesshire, originally called Blair Bog, but afterwards 'The Whim,' which eventually became his favourite residence. In 1767, he bought for £40,000 Stanhope and Stobo with its feudal barony in Peeblesshire, part of the estates of Sir David Murray, which had been confiscated for their owner's complicity in the prebellion of 1745. He thenceforward chiefly resided in the country, where his good methods of farming and the improvements which he promoted, notably the Peebles and Edinburgh road in 1770, gained for him the title of 'The Father of the County.'\n\nMontgomery died at Stobo on 2 April 1803 and is buried in Stobo churchyard.\n\nMontgomery married Margaret Scot, daughter and heiress of Robert Scot of Killearn, Stirlingshire.\n\nMontgomery was succeeded in his baronetcy by James, his second son, afterwards Lord Advocate, his first-born son, William, a lieutenant-colonel in the 43rd foot, having predeceased him.\n\nMontgomery and his wife, Margaret Scott, are buried in a walled-off part of the cemetery at Stobo Kirk near Peebles, with an unusual wall lining of yew hedge. His home had been the nearby Stobo Castle, which he purchased in 1767 for the sum of £40,500.\n\nMontgomery was grandfather to James Francis Montgomery.\n\n"}

Situated on the West Coast Main Line, the station is now an important marshalling point for commuter trains from here for most stations to .\n\nThere are five full length (12-car) platforms, with one side platform and two islands. To the east of the station are some south facing sidings connecting to the slow lines. Platforms 1 & 2 are the fast-line platforms, platforms 3 & 5 are the slow-line platforms and platform 4 is used by starting and terminating services to/from Euston and additional through trains southbound.\n\nTring station was opened by the London and Birmingham Railway (L&BR) on 16 October 1837 when the L&BR extended its line out of London beyond to Tring. The first train to Tring ran from Primrose Hill at 9:00 am on 16 October 1837, reaching Tring at 10:10 am. On 15 November 1844, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert made their first train journey north from Euston, reaching Tring in 52 minutes where the train stopped to take on water. Despite rain, the appearance of the royal train attracted crowds of farm labourers and local children, to the Queen's delight. It is reported the after this stop, Victoria asked that the speed of her train be reduced.\n\nThe L&BR was constructed by the railway engineer Robert Stephenson. He originally planned a route which would have taken the new railway to the east of Tring, but vociferous opposition from influential local landowners such as the Earl of Essex, Earl of Clarendon, Lord Brownlow and Sir Astley Cooper delayed the project and forced the route to be changed before parliamentary approval could be obtained, with the result that Tring railway station had to be sited some distance from the town. The remote location of Tring station is sometimes wrongly attributed to objections which were said to have been made by Lord Rothschild to protect his land in Tring; in fact, Lord Rothschild was not born until 1840, three years after the railway had opened and the Tring lands were only acquired by his father Lionel in 1872. He did, however, object to a much later plan to build a steam tramway between Tring Station and . Tring station's distance from the town would have been greater had the L&BR placed the station at Pitstone Green, some three miles further north, as it originally planned to do. The preferred location at Pendley required purchasing land from the Comte d'Harcourt, another landowner reluctant to admit the railways to his estate, and he demanded such an exorbitant price that the L&BR selected a cheaper but less convenient plot of land. The townspeople of Tring were so enthusiastic for a railway that in 1837 they raised funds to bridge the difference in price between what the Company was prepared to pay and the price demanded by the Harcourt estate. They also supported the construction of a new road to the station and according to the 1839 issue of the \"Railway Times\", \"As soon as the Company had determined upon making it a first class station (where every train stops), the inhabitants came forward in a very spirited manner, and at their own expense formed a new road direct to the town\".\n\nTring station was originally intended as a destination of a branch of the Metropolitan Railway (MR). A short section of the branch from to was built in 1887–89 before the MR chose to construct an alternative route across the Chilterns via instead. Although the MR continued to buy land between Chesham and Tring for some years after Chesham station opened, the route was never extended further and today Chesham remains as a branch line terminus of Transport for London's Metropolitan line.\n\nTring lies on a major commuter route into central London and most West Coast Main Line train services run directly into London Euston. It is the terminus of many slower London Northwestern trains out of Euston and platform 4 provides a turnaround for these trains. Tring is served by a few evening trains to and from Birmingham, and one early morning train to Crewe on weekdays and Saturdays, but most of the trains which serve the station go no further than Milton Keynes Central. It is also served by an hourly cross-London service which runs via the West London Line to serve stations in South London.\n\nThe typical off-peak services in each direction are:\n\nMondays-Saturdays \nSundays \n\nIn the \"London & South East Rail Utilisation Strategy\" document published by Network Rail in 2011, Tring was identified as a terminus of a possible northern extension of the Crossrail lines now under construction in central London. The report recommends the addition of a tunnel in the vicinity of the proposed station at connecting the Crossrail route to the West Coast Mainline. The diversion of rail services through central London would enable a direct link from stations such as Tring to West End stations such as and would alleviate congestion at Euston station; Crossrail services currently planned to terminate at due to capacity constraints would also be able to continue further west, allowing for a more efficient use of the line. This proposal has not been officially confirmed or funded, although an announcement made in August 2014 by the transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin indicated that the government was actively evaluating the possibility of extending Crossrail as far as Tring and Milton Keynes Central.\n\n"}

The law had been discovered and published by the English physicist Henry Moseley in 1913-1914. Until Moseley's work, \"atomic number\" was merely an element's place in the periodic table and was not known to be associated with any measurable physical quantity. In brief, the law states that the square root of the frequency of the emitted x-ray is approximately proportional to the atomic number.\n\nThe historic periodic table was roughly ordered by increasing atomic \"weight\", but in a few famous cases the physical properties of two elements suggested that the heavier ought to precede the lighter. An example is cobalt having a weight of 58.9 and nickel having an atomic weight of 58.7.\n\nHenry Moseley and other physicists used x-ray diffraction to study the elements, and the results of their experiments led to organizing the periodic table by proton count.\n\nSince the spectral emissions for the heavier elements would be in the soft X-ray range (absorbed by air), the spectrometry apparatus had to be enclosed inside a vacuum. Details of the experimental setup are documented in the journal articles \"The High-Frequency Spectra of the Elements\" Part I and Part II.\n\nMoseley found that the formula_1 lines (in Siegbahn notation) were indeed related to the atomic number, \"Z.\" \n\nFollowing Bohr's lead, Moseley found that for the spectral lines, this relationship could be \"approximated\" by a simple formula, later called \"Moseley's Law\".\n\nwhere:\n\nformula_6 Rydberg frequency and formula_5= 1 for formula_1 lines, and formula_9 (Rydberg frequency) and formula_5= 7.4 for formula_11 lines.\n\nMoseley derived his formula empirically by line fitting the square roots of the X-ray frequencies plotted by atomic number, and his formula could be explained in terms of the Bohr model of the atom. \n\nin which\n\nIt is assumed that the final energy level is less than the initial energy level.\n\nConsidering the empirically found constant that approximately reduced (or apparently \"screened\") the energy of the charges, Bohr's formula for Moseley's formula_1 X-ray transitions became:\n\nor (dividing both sides by \"h\" to convert \"E\" to formula_20):<br>\n\nThe coefficient in this formula simplifies to a frequency of  Ry, with an approximate value of .\n\nA simplified explanation for the effective charge of a nucleus being one less than its actual charge is that an unpaired electron in the K-shell screens it. An elaborate discussion criticizing Moseley's interpretation of screening can be found in a paper by Whitaker which is repeated in most modern texts.\n\nA list of experimentally found X-ray transitions is available at NIST. Theoretical energies can be computed to a much greater accuracy than Moseley's law using a method based on Dirac-Fock.\n\n\n"}

She was raised in Bay Shore, New York on Long Island. Quincy Jones and Dinah Washington have referred to themselves as her godparents.\n\nWhen Austin was four years old, she performed at the Apollo Theater. As a teenager she recorded commercial jingles and worked as a session singer in soul and R&B. She had an R&B hit in 1969 with \"Family Tree\". She sang backing vocals on Paul Simon's 1975 number-one hit \"50 Ways to Leave Your Lover\". The jazz label CTI released her debut album, \"End of a Rainbow\", in 1976. She sang \"The Closer I Get to You\" for Tom Browne's album \"Browne Sugar\", a duet with Michael Jackson for his album \"Off the Wall\", and a duet with George Benson on \"Moody's Mood for Love\". After singing on Quincy Jones's album \"The Dude\", she signed a contract with his record label, Qwest, which released \"Every Home Should Have One\" with \"Baby, Come to Me\", a duet with James Ingram that became a No. 1 hit on the \"Billboard\" magazine pop chart. A second duet with Ingram, \"How Do You Keep the Music Playing\", appeared on soundtrack to the movie \"Best Friends\" (1982). GRP released her album \"Love Is Gonna Getcha\", which contained the singles \"Good in Love\" and \"Through the Test of Time\". \nAustin was scheduled to be on United Flight 93 on September 11, 2001, but because her mother suffered a stroke days before, she cancelled her ticket and flew at a different time. \n\nIn 2000 she performed with the WDR Big Band.

{"id": "1983288", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1983288", "title": "Yates High School", "text": "Yates High School\n\nJack Yates Senior High School is a secondary school located at 3650 Alabama, very near Texas Southern University, in the historic Third Ward in Houston, Texas, United States. Yates High School handles grades nine through twelve and is part of the Houston Independent School District (HISD).\n\nYates was named after Reverend John Henry \"Jack\" Yates, a former slave and a minister. Jack Yates and other leading blacks established the Houston Baptist Academy. Within a decade, the success of the school prompted Reverend Yates to reorganize the Houston Baptist Academy as the Houston College, the school offered a special opportunity to the black children of the community who sought an alternative to the Colored High School of the public school system.\n\nYates has HISD's magnet program for communications: broadcast TV, radio, print, and photography. Yates also houses a maritime studies magnet program.\n\nIn 2010 Paul Knight of the \"Houston Press\" wrote that \"the school remains a symbol of solidarity in the Third Ward.\"\n\nIn June 2016, members of the Jack Yates and HISD communities held a ground-breaking ceremony for the new state-of-the-art campus. A $59.4 million brand new campus was completed next to the old campus in summer 2018.\n\nYates was established on February 8, 1926, as Yates Colored High School with 17 teachers and 600 students. The school, at 2610 Elgin, was the second school for African-Americans established in Houston. At the time schools were segregated on the basis of race.\n\nPreviously Houston had only one secondary school for black people, Colored High School. In 1925 the school board stated that it would build a new black high school due to the increasing black population. The \"Houston Informer\" stated that the schools need to be named after prominent black people from the city and/or other successful black persons. The new high school was to be named after Jack Yates, a prominent black Houstonian, and the original colored high school was renamed Booker T. Washington High School.\n\nThe original Yates High was built from a $4 million (about $ when accounting for inflation) bond program, which included $500,000 (about $ when accounting for inflation) to renovate 17 existing schools and build new schools. Clifton Richardson, the editor of the \"Houston Informer\", had felt skepticism towards this proposal but ultimately asked Houston's African-Americans to vote for the bond and endorsed it in the \"Informer\". In 1925 HISD originally proposed to have the school built for $100,000 (about $ when accounting for inflation), but Richardson opposed this plan, prompting the district to revise the bond. The first principal, James D. Ryan, served from the opening until his death in 1941; William S. Holland became Yates's second principal that year.\n\nIn 1927 the Yates building began housing Houston Colored Junior College, later Houston College for Negroes.\n\nIn pre-desegregation times middle and upper class black families sent their children to Yates.\n\nBy February 1951 Yates had 2,100 students. By that month Jack Yates had an addition that slightly increased student capacity and a remodeling, but the school was still overcrowded as the enlarged facility was designed for 1,600 students. By March 1954 the student body was over 3,000. As a result of the overcrowding the Southern Association of Secondary Schools pulled Yates's accreditation.\n\nIn 1955, as a new Allen Elementary School opened in a neighborhood far from its original location, the former Allen campus, in what is now Midtown, became the Yates Annex, a school for black 7th graders. In 1956, the annex was converted into J. Will Jones Elementary School.\n\nOn January 27, 1958, Worthing High School opened, relieving Yates. Yates moved to its current location in September 1958. Yates's former site became Ryan Colored Junior High School (now Ryan Middle School), named after the first principal of Yates. The HISD school board forced Holland to stay at Ryan Middle School instead of moving onto the new Yates, and a petition from the community did not succeed in changing this.\n\nSchools in HISD were named after former principals William S. Holland and James E. Codwell.\n\nAfter the circa 1970 desegregation resulting from the Civil Rights Movement, HISD had established magnet programs and other alternative education programs. Many upper and middle class blacks sent their children to Bellaire High School, Lamar High School, and other schools previously only for Whites; until 1970 HISD counted its Hispanic and Latino students as \"white.\" In addition, many black people moved from the Third Ward to the suburbs. Violence became more common and the facility was defaced with graffiti. William G. Ouchi, author of \"Making Schools Work: A Revolutionary Plan to Get Your Children the Education They Need\", wrote that due to the loss of the middle and upper class students, Yates \"fell on hard times.\"\n\nThe Yates photography magnet school program began in fall 1978.\n\nIn 1987 a survey at Yates showed that 108 female students were pregnant and 50% of them were having their second pregnancies. In 1989 Chester Smith, the principal, prohibited the school newspaper from publishing a story about a pregnant student.\n\nIn the 1990s superintendent Rod Paige recruited Robert Worthy, who was previously teaching in the Pasadena Independent School District, to revitalize the school. Worthy removed most of the administrators and 60 teachers, making up about half of the faculty, within a two-year period to remove any pre-existing negative cultural influences from Yates. Worthy also established additional Advanced Placement courses and removed a Cleaning and Pressing Program.\n\nIn 1997 a geographic area south of Interstate 45 was rezoned from Austin High School to Yates. After the 2000 opening of Chávez High School, portions of the Yates boundary were reassigned to Austin High School.\n\nFrom 1998 through 2002 the school reported that 99% of students graduating from Yates planned to attend colleges and universities. In response a parent and alumnus of Yates quoted in a 2003 \"The New York Times\" article, Larry Blackmon, stated that \"Absolutely, positively, no way. You'd get more of an accurate count asking elementary kids if they plan to go to college.\"\n\nCirca 2003 the principal of Yates hired several uncertified teachers and substitute teachers, using them to replace experienced but more highly paid teachers who were fired by the principal. In addition around that time Yates had gone without a school library for over a year.\n\nIn 2006, Houston mayor Bill White proclaimed February 7 as \"Jack Yates Senior High School Day.\"\n\nIn 2007, a Johns Hopkins University study commissioned by the Associated Press cited Yates as a \"dropout factory\" where at least 40% of the entering freshman class do not make it to their senior year.\n\nIn 2008 Ouchi stated that Yates had improved during Worthy's term as principal, citing the \"pride\" present in the school, the students' compliance with the school uniform policy, and hallways that were \"clean enough to eat on\".\n\nYates, along with Sam Houston High School and Kashmere High School, was low-performing in test scores from 2001 to 2004. Because of this problem, there were movements to have the state or another organization take over the schools for a period so the test scores would be at acceptable levels. Yates received an \"acceptable\" rating from the Texas Education Agency in 2005.\n\nIn a 2005 \"Houston Chronicle\" article Bill Miller, president of the Yates High School Parent-Teacher-Student Association, criticized the decrease in enrollment. Many students in the Yates High School attendance zone instead chose to attend other high schools. Miller proposed having HISD end its open enrollment policies.\n\nIn an e-mail sent in 2010, HISD board member and former Yates student Paula Harris said that she was responsible for having a principal at Yates removed from the school and for having the new principal installed.\n\nIn June 2015 Ericka Mellon of the \"Houston Chronicle\" wrote that members of the Third Ward community had \"concerns about leadership turnover, weak academic performance and safety problems\" and were \"vocal with its frustrations at Yates\".\n\nIn May 2015 Donetrus Hill, then the principal of Yates, resigned and took a settlement agreement. Kenneth Davis, who previously served as the principal of Dowling Middle School (now Lawson Middle School) and as a supervisor of HISD middle school principals, became the principal of Yates at that time.\n\nSeveral areas inside the 610 Loop that are south of Downtown, including the Third Ward, Timbercrest, University Oaks, Oak Manor, University Woods, Scott Terrace, Lucky 7, South Union, Foster Place, Washington Terrace, MacGregor Place, and LaSalette Place, as well as most of Riverside Terrace, are zoned to Yates.\n\nCuney Homes, a unit of Houston Housing Authority (HHA) public housing, is zoned to Yates.\n\nIn addition Cambridge Oaks, a university housing complex, is zoned to Yates. Cambridge Oaks houses University of Houston students and is the institution's designated family housing unit.\n\nThe current Yates campus has the Crimson & Gold Café as its cafeteria, and it has eight science laboratories. The campus is located between Texas Southern University and the University of Houston.\n\nIn 2012 Richard Connelly of the \"Houston Press\" ranked the previous Yates campus as the second most architecturally beautiful high school campus in Greater Houston. Connelly said that \"Some would call this generic, but we like the proud `60s style.\"\n\nIn 2018, the school had approximately 900 students. About 90% African-American and 10% Hispanic,\n\nIn 2010 the school had about 1,200 students. Most of them were African-American. Of the remainder, 88 were Hispanic, 7 were Asian, and 3 were White.\n\nIn the 2015-2016 school year Yates gained over 110 students who moved from other HISD schools, while 738 high school students previously attending Yates moved to other HISD schools.\n\nYates had 3,600 students in the mid-1980s. In 2001, by a margin of 700 votes, the student body voted for an Asian American as Mr. Yates, reflecting an increase in non-black students in majority black schools in the Houston area.\n\nStudents at Yates are required to wear a school uniform. The Texas Education Agency specifies that the parents and/or guardians of students zoned to a school with uniforms may apply for a waiver to opt out of the uniform policy so their children do not have to wear the uniform; parents must specify \"bona fide\" reasons, such as religious reasons or philosophical objections.\n\nIn 2020, Yates became the fifth HISD high school to become an International Baccalaureate school.\n\nYates has HISD's magnet program for communications: broadcast TV, radio, print, and photography. Yates also houses a maritime studies magnet program.\n\nPrior to 2015 the school allowed students who missed too many classes to pass a course but otherwise had passing grades to do cleaning work to make up for the absences. HISD asked Yates to change its policy.\n\nJack Yates competes in several sports, but the most prominent and successful sport on campus is boys' basketball.} In 1994 Andrew W. Miracle, the author of \"Lessons of the Locker Room: The Myth of School Sports\", wrote that the athletics programs at Yates High School have the same kind of importance in the Third Ward as the athletics programs at rural Texas high schools do for their respective small town and rural communities.\n\nIn the segregation era Yates did not play games against white high schools. It was a part of the Prairie View Interscholastic League, an all-black sports league, from 1940 until 1968. In 1969 the Prairie View League was dissolved and Yates joined the University Interscholastic League (UIL).\n\nIn February 2012 Yates was reclassified as a UIL 3A school, down from the 4A level.\n\nIn 2010 Paul Knight of the \"Houston Press\" stated \"no high school basketball team in the state and perhaps the country has played better than Yates.\" As of 2010, only two of the players on the basketball team were not from the Third Ward.\n\nIn March 2010, Yates' boys basketball team was ranked number one in the nation by \"USA Today\" having defeated their opponents by margins of 135, 115, 99 (twice), 98, 90 and 88 points. On January 6, 2010, the basketball team defeated Class 4A District 21 opponent Lee High School (now Wisdom High School) 170-35, setting the state record for points in a game and sparking a debate in the process. Despite a 100-12 halftime lead, the Lions stayed true to their pressing and trapping style, which did not sit well with Lee head coach Jacques Armant.\n\nJacques Armant, the basketball coach at Lee High, criticized the mass scoring, saying that it could cause violence. ESPN writer Rick Reilly criticized Yates basketball Coach Greg Wise and stated \"At the very least, USA Today ought to remove Yates from its national rankings -- the school is No. 1 -- as a statement about basic sports decency.\"\n\nAs of 2015, Jack Yates boys' basketball program has won four state titles since the 2009 season.\n\nAs of circa 1994 the head football coach of Yates stated that \"You cannot deny that football affects the community in a big way.\"\n\nIn the segregation era schools for blacks played their games on weekdays while schools for whites played their games on Fridays.\n\nIn 1939 Yates coach Andrew \"Pat\" Patterson asked principal William S. Holland to meet with E. B. Evans, the president of Prairie View A&M University, to discuss regulating American football played by black schools and establishing a football league for them. The Prairie View Leagues established a football league in 1940 and Yates was in this league until 1968. Rick Sherrod, author of \"Texas High School Football Dynasties\", described Patterson as the \"architect\" of the PVIL football league.\n\nHistorically the American football game between Yates and Wheatley High School was among the most prominent ones in the United States. Beginning in 1927, each Thanksgiving Day the school's American football team played Yates High School's football team at the Jeppeson Stadium. The Yates-Wheatley Thanksgiving football match, described by \"On American Soil: How Justice Became a Casualty of World War II\" author Jack Hamann as \"the most important noncollege football game in the country\", often had crowds that had over 30,000 people. The rivalry declined after Yates joined the UIL, and after the football leagues integrated the Thanksgiving Day Yates-Wheatley game ended.\n\nCoach Patterson, while in the PVIL league, had a 73.2% win record, 200-64-9, and his team received four state titles from PVIL.\n\nYates lost to Lake Highlands High School in the 1981 Texas state American football championship game. The principal of Yates stated that a \"positive atmosphere\" occurred in the Third Ward despite the loss since Yates had gotten to the championships.\n\nYates won the 1985 Texas 5-A American football championship game at Texas Stadium in Irving, defeating the Odessa Permian High School.\n\nElementary schools that feed into Yates include:\n(partial)\n\nPortions of Cullen Middle School, including portions formerly zoned to Ryan Middle School, feed into Yates.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He campaigned against patronage in the Church. He was appointed Solicitor General for Scotland in 1737 and promoted to Lord Advocate in 1746. He was Member of Parliament for Elgin Burghs from 1747 to 1754, and carried bills for the abolition of heritable jurisdictions, wardholding and for annexation of forfeited estates to the Crown. He was appointed a Lord of Session and Justiciary as Lord Prestongrange in 1754, and a Commissioner of annexed estates in 1755.\n\nWilliam Grant was the second son of Sir Francis Grant, Lord Cullen, by his second wife, Sarah, daughter of the Rev. Alexander Fordyce of Ayton, Berwickshire. He was admitted an advocate on 24 February 1722, and on 13 May 1731 was appointed procurator for the church of Scotland, and principal clerk to the general assembly.\n\nIn 1736 Grant wrote a pamphlet \"Remarks on the State of the Church of Scotland with respect to Patronages, and with reference to a Bill now depending before Parliament\", On 20 June 1737 he succeeded Charles Erskine of Tinwald as Solicitor General, and on 28 August in the following year was constituted one of the commissioners for improving the fisheries and manufactures of Scotland. Upon the retirement of Robert Craigie, Grant was appointed Lord Advocate on 26 February 1746, and on 20 May following the assembly held that the lord advocate could not act as procurator and clerk, and that consequently these offices were vacated.\n\nAt a by-election in February 1747 Grant was returned to parliament as member for the Elgin Burghs, and on 1 April 1747 was \"added to the gentlemen who are appointed to prepare and bring in a bill for taking away and abolishing the heretable jurisdictions in … Scotland\". Grant took part in the debate on the second reading of the bill, and is said by Horace Walpole to have spoken \"excessively well for it\". This important measure of Scottish reform was subsequently carried through both houses and passed, as well as another bill, which had been introduced by the lord advocate and the English law officers, for the abolition of ward holding.\n\nAt the general election in July 1747 Grant was again returned for the Elgin burghs, and in April 1749 supported the grant to the city of Glasgow for the losses sustained during the rebellion in a vigorous speech. On 24 February 1752 he introduced a bill for annexing the forfeited estates in Scotland to the crown inalienably, which after some opposition became law.\n\nHe was for the third time returned for the Elgin burghs at the general election in May 1754, but vacated his seat on his appointment as an ordinary lord of session and a Lord of Justiciary in the place of Patrick Grant, Lord Elchies. He took his seat on the bench on 14 November 1754, and assumed the title of Lord Prestongrange. In the following year he was appointed one of the commissioners for the annexed estates. Grant died at Bath on 23 May 1764, aged 63, and was buried on 7 June following in the aisle of Prestonpans Church, Haddingtonshire, where a monument in the churchyard was erected to his memory.\n\nGrant is said to have written \"The occasional Writer, containing an Answer to the second Manifesto of the Pretender's eldest Son, which bears date at the Palace of Holyrood House, 10 October 1745; containing Reflections, political and historical, upon the last Revolution, and the Progress of the present Rebellion in Scotland\",' London, 1745, 8vo. The authorship of this pamphlet has, however, also been ascribed to Thomas Hollis.\n\nTytler speaks highly of his integrity, candour, and \"winning gentleness\", and says that his \"conduct in the adjustment of the claims on the forfeited estates merited universal approbation\". With the exception of the proceedings at the trial of James Stewart in May 1752 (where as Lord Advocate he was chief prosecutor), Grant's conduct as public prosecutor was both fair and moderate.\n\nGrant married Grizel (died 1792), daughter of the Rev. – Millar. They had four daughters:\n\nOn the death of Janet, Countess of Hyndford in 1818, her nephew, Sir James Suttie, succeeded to the Preston-Grange estate (purchased by Grant in 1746), and assumed the additional surname of Grant.\n\nGrant was the chief prosecutor of \"James of the Glen\" Stewart for aiding and abetting \"The Appin Murder\" – the May 1752 ambush and murder of Colin \"The Red Fox\" Campbell. This incident is described in Robert Louis Stevenson's novel \"Catriona\" where he appears as Lord Prestongrange.\n\nAttribution\n\n"}
{"id": "1983326", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1983326", "title": "History of the automobile", "text": "History of the automobile\n\nIn 1769 the first steam-powered automobile capable of human transportation was built by Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot.\n\nIn 1803, Hayden Wischett designed the first car powered by the de Rivaz engine, an internal combustion engine that was fueled by hydrogen.\n\nIn 1870 Siegfried Marcus built his first combustion engine powered pushcart, followed by four progressively more sophisticated combustion-engine cars over a 10-to-15-year span that influenced later cars. John created the two-cycle combustion engine. The car's third incarnation in 1889 introduced a four-cycle, gasoline-powered engine, an ingenious carburetor design and magneto ignition. He created an additional two models further refining his design with steering, a clutch and a brake.\n\nThe four-stroke petrol (Diesel) internal combustion engine that still constitutes the most prevalent form of modern automotive propulsion was patented by Nicolaus Otto. The similar two-stroke diesel engine was invented by Rudolf Diesel. The hydrogen fuel cell, one of the technologies hailed as a replacement for energy as a gasoline source for planes, was discovered in principle by Christian Friedrich Schönbein in 1838. The battery electric car owes its beginnings to Ányos Jedlik, one of the inventors of the electric motor, and Gaston Planté, who invented the lead–acid battery in 1859.\n\nIn 1882 the Italian Enrico Bernardi created the first petrol-powered vehicle, a tricycle for his son Louis. He drove it through the street of a village near the Italian city of Verona.\n\nIn 1880, Karl Benz developed a petrol or gasoline-powered mobile auto. This is not considered to be the first \"production\" vehicle as Karl made several other identical copies. The automobile was powered by a single cylinder four-stroke engine.\n\nIn 1908, the Ford Model T, created by the Ford Motor Company, began production and would become the first automobile to be mass-produced on a moving assembly line. From 1913 to 1927, Ford produced over 15,000,000 Model T automobiles.\n\nThe early history of the automobile was concentrated on the search for a reliable portable power unit to propel the vehicle.\n\nFerdinand Verbiest, a member of a Jesuit mission in China, built a steam-powered vehicle around 1672 as a toy for the Kangxi Emperor. It was small-scale and could not carry a driver but it was, quite possibly, the first working steam-powered vehicle ('auto-mobile').\n\nSteam-powered self-propelled vehicles large enough to transport people and cargo were first devised in the late 18th century. Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot demonstrated his \"fardier à vapeur\" (\"steam dray\"), an experimental steam-driven artillery tractor, in 1770 and 1771. As Cugnot's design proved to be impractical, his invention was not developed in his native France. The center of innovation shifted to Great Britain. By 1784, William Murdoch had built a working model of a steam carriage in Redruth and in 1801 Richard Trevithick was running a full-sized vehicle on the roads in Camborne. The first automobile patent in the United States was granted to Oliver Evans in 1789.\n\nDuring the 19th century attempts were made to introduce practical steam-powered vehicles. Innovations such as hand brakes, multi-speed transmissions and better steering developed. Some commercially successful vehicles provided mass transit until a backlash against these large vehicles resulted in the passage of legislation such as the United Kingdom Locomotive Act (1865), which required many self-propelled vehicles on public roads to be preceded by a man on foot waving a red flag and blowing a horn. This effectively halted road auto development in the UK for most of the rest of the 19th century; inventors and engineers shifted their efforts to improvements in railway locomotives. The law was not repealed until 1896, although the need for the red flag was removed in 1878.\n\nIn 1816, a professor at Prague Polytechnic, Josef Bozek, built an oil-fired steam car. Walter Hancock, builder and operator of London steam buses, in 1838 built a 2-seated car phaeton.\n\nIn 1867, Canadian jeweller Henry Seth Taylor demonstrated his 4-wheeled \"steam buggy\" at the Stanstead Fair in Stanstead, Quebec and again the following year. The basis of the buggy, which he began building in 1865, was a high-wheeled carriage with bracing to support a two-cylinder steam engine mounted on the floor.\n\nOne of the first \"real\" automobiles was produced in 1873 by Frenchman Amédée Bollée in Le Mans, who built self-propelled steam road vehicles to transport groups of passengers.\n\nThe first carriage-sized automobile suitable for use on existing wagon roads in the United States was a steam-powered vehicle invented in 1871 by Dr. J.W. Carhart, a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in Racine, Wisconsin. It induced the State of Wisconsin in 1875 to offer a $10,000 award to the first to produce a practical substitute for the use of horses and other animals. They stipulated that the vehicle would have to maintain an average speed of more than over a course. The offer led to the first city to city automobile race in the United States, starting on 16 July 1878 in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and ending in Madison, Wisconsin, via Appleton, Oshkosh, Waupun, Watertown, Fort Atkinson, and Janesville. While seven vehicles were registered, only two started to compete: the entries from Green Bay and Oshkosh. The vehicle from Green Bay was faster, but broke down before completing the race. The Oshkosh finished the course in 33 hours and 27 minutes, and posted an average speed of six miles per hour. In 1879, the legislature awarded half the prize.\n\n\nSteam-powered road vehicles, both cars and wagons, reached the peak of their development in the early 1930s with fast-steaming lightweight boilers and efficient engine designs. Internal combustion engines also developed greatly during WWI, becoming simpler to operate and more reliable. The development of the high-speed diesel engine from 1930 began to replace them for wagons, accelerated in the UK by tax changes making steam wagons uneconomic overnight. Although a few designers continued to advocate steam power, no significant developments in production steam cars took place after Doble in 1931.\n\nWhether steam cars will ever be reborn in later technological eras remains to be seen. Magazines such as \"Light Steam Power\" continued to describe them into the 1980s. The 1950s saw interest in steam-turbine cars powered by small nuclear reactors (this was also true of aircraft), but the dangers inherent in nuclear fission technology soon killed these ideas.\n\nIn 1828, Ányos Jedlik, a Hungarian who invented an early type of electric motor, created a tiny model car powered by his new motor. In 1834, Vermont blacksmith Thomas Davenport, the inventor of the first American DC electric motor, installed his motor in a small model car, which he operated on a short circular electrified track. In 1835, Professor Sibrandus Stratingh of Groningen, the Netherlands and his assistant Christopher Becker created a small-scale electrical car, powered by non-rechargeable primary cells. In 1838, Scotsman Robert Davidson built an electric locomotive that attained a speed of . In England, a patent was granted in 1840 for the use of tracks as conductors of electric current, and similar American patents were issued to Lilley and Colten in 1847.\n\nSources point to different creations as the first electric car. Between 1832 and 1839 (the exact year is uncertain) Robert Anderson of Scotland invented a crude electric carriage, powered by non-rechargeable primary cells. In November 1881, French inventor Gustave Trouvé demonstrated a working three-wheeled car powered by electricity at the International Exposition of Electricity, Paris. English inventor Thomas Parker, who was responsible for innovations such as electrifying the London Underground, overhead tramways in Liverpool and Birmingham, and the smokeless fuel coalite, built the first production electric car in London in 1884, using his own specially designed high-capacity rechargeable batteries. But others regard the \"Flocken Elektrowagen\" of 1888 by German inventor Andreas Flocken as the first true electric car.\nElectric cars enjoyed popularity between the late 19th century and early 20th century, when electricity was among the preferred methods for automobile propulsion, providing a level of comfort and ease of operation that could not be achieved by the gasoline cars of the time. Advances in internal combustion technology, especially the electric starter, soon rendered this advantage moot; the greater range of gasoline cars, quicker refueling times, and growing petroleum infrastructure, along with the mass production of gasoline vehicles by companies such as the Ford Motor Company, which reduced prices of gasoline cars to less than half that of equivalent electric cars, led to a decline in the use of electric propulsion, effectively removing it from important markets such as the United States by the 1930s. However, in recent years, increased concerns over the environmental impact of gasoline cars, higher gasoline prices, improvements in battery technology, and the prospect of peak oil, have brought about renewed interest in electric cars, which are perceived to be more environmentally friendly and cheaper to maintain and run, despite high initial costs, after a failed reappearance in the late-1990s.\n\nEarly attempts at making and using internal combustion engines were hampered by the lack of suitable fuels, particularly liquids, therefore the earliest engines used gas mixtures.\n\nEarly experimenters used gases. In 1806, Swiss engineer François Isaac de Rivaz built an engine powered by internal combustion of a hydrogen and oxygen mixture. In 1826, Englishman Samuel Brown tested his hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engine by using it to propel a vehicle up Shooter's Hill in south-east London. Belgian-born Etienne Lenoir's Hippomobile with a hydrogen-gas-fuelled one-cylinder internal combustion engine made a test drive from Paris to Joinville-le-Pont in 1860, covering some nine kilometres in about three hours. A later version was propelled by coal gas. A Delamare-Deboutteville vehicle was patented and trialled in 1884.\n\nAbout 1870, in Vienna, Austria (then the Austro-Hungarian Empire), inventor Siegfried Marcus put a liquid-fuelled internal combustion engine on a simple handcart which made him the first man to propel a vehicle by means of gasoline. Today, this car is known as \"the first Marcus car\". In 1883, Marcus secured a German patent for a low-voltage ignition system of the magneto type; this was his only automotive patent. This design was used for all further engines, and the four-seat \"second Marcus car\" of 1888/89. This ignition, in conjunction with the \"rotating-brush carburetor\", made the second car's design very innovative. His second car is on display at the Technical Museum in Vienna. During his lifetime, he was honored as the originator of the motorcar but his place in history was all but erased by the Nazis during World War II. Because Marcus was of Jewish descent, the Nazi propaganda office ordered his work to be destroyed, his name expunged from future textbooks, and his public memorials removed, giving credit instead to Karl Benz.\n\nIt is generally acknowledged that the first really practical automobiles with petrol/gasoline-powered internal combustion engines were completed almost simultaneously by several German inventors working independently: Karl Benz built his first automobile in 1885 in Mannheim. Benz was granted a patent for his automobile on 29 January 1886, and began the first production of automobiles in 1888, after Bertha Benz, his wife, had proved – with the first long-distance trip in August 1888, from Mannheim to Pforzheim and back – that the horseless coach was capable of extended travel. Since 2008 a Bertha Benz Memorial Route commemorates this event.\n\nSoon after, Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in Stuttgart in 1889 designed a vehicle from scratch to be an automobile, rather than a horse-drawn carriage fitted with an engine. They also are usually credited with invention of the first motorcycle in 1886, but Italy's Enrico Bernardi of the University of Padua, in 1882, patented a one-cylinder petrol motor, fitting it into his son's tricycle, making it at least a candidate for the first automobile and first motorcycle. Bernardi enlarged the tricycle in 1892 to carry two adults.\n\nThe first four-wheeled petrol-driven automobile in Britain was built in Walthamstow by Frederick Bremer in 1892. Another was made in Birmingham in 1895 by Frederick William Lanchester, who also patented the disc brake. The first electric starter was installed on an Arnold, an adaptation of the Benz Velo, built in Kent between 1895 and 1898.\n\nGeorge Foote Foss of Sherbrooke, Quebec built a single-cylinder gasoline car in 1896 which he drove for 4 years, ignoring city officials' warnings of arrest for his \"mad antics.\"\n\nIn all the turmoil, many early pioneers are nearly forgotten. In 1891, John William Lambert built a three-wheeler in Ohio City, Ohio, which was destroyed in a fire the same year, while Henry Nadig constructed a four-wheeler in Allentown, Pennsylvania. It is likely they were not the only ones.\n\nThe American George B. Selden filed for a patent on 8 May 1879. His application included not only the engine but its use in a four-wheeled car. Selden filed a series of amendments to his application which stretched out the legal process, resulting in a delay of 16 years before the patent was granted on 5 November 1895. This patent did more to hinder than encourage development of autos in the United States. Selden licensed his patent to most major American automakers, collecting a fee on every car they produced.\n\nThe first production of automobiles was by Karl Benz in 1888 in Germany and, under license from Benz, in France by Emile Roger. There were numerous others, including tricycle builders Rudolf Egg, Edward Butler, and Léon Bollée. Bollée, using a engine of his own design, enabled his driver, Jamin, to average in the 1897 Paris-Tourville rally. By 1900, mass production of automobiles had begun in France and the United States.\n\nThe first company formed exclusively to build automobiles was Panhard et Levassor in France, which also introduced the first four-cylinder engine. Formed in 1889, Panhard was quickly followed by Peugeot two years later. By the start of the 20th century, the automobile industry was beginning to take off in Western Europe, especially in France, where 30,204 were produced in 1903, representing 48.8% of world automobile production that year.\n\nIn the United States, brothers Charles and Frank Duryea founded the Duryea Motor Wagon Company in 1893, becoming the first American automobile manufacturing company. The Autocar Company, founded in 1897, established a number of innovations still in use and remains the oldest operating motor vehicle manufacturer in the United States. However, it was Ransom E. Olds and his Olds Motor Vehicle Company (later known as Oldsmobile) who would dominate this era with the introduction of the Oldsmobile Curved Dash. Its production line was running in 1901. The Thomas B. Jeffery Company developed the world's second mass-produced automobile, and 1,500 Ramblers were built and sold in its first year, representing one-sixth of all existing motorcars in the United States at the time. Within a year, Cadillac (formed from the Henry Ford Company), Winton, and Ford were also producing cars in the thousands. The Studebaker brothers, having become the world's leading manufacturers of horse-drawn vehicles, made a transition to electric automobiles in 1902, and gasoline engines in 1904. They continued to build horse-drawn vehicles until 1919.\n\nThe first motor car in Central Europe was produced by the Austro-Hungarian company Nesselsdorfer Wagenbau (later renamed to Tatra in today's Czech Republic) in 1897, the Präsident automobile. In 1898, Louis Renault had a De Dion-Bouton modified, with fixed drive shaft and differential, making \"perhaps the first hot rod in history\" and bringing Renault and his brothers into the car industry. Innovation was rapid and rampant, with no clear standards for basic vehicle architectures, body styles, construction materials, or controls, for example many veteran cars use a tiller, rather than a wheel for steering. During 1903, Rambler standardized on the steering wheel and moved the driver's position to the left-hand side of the vehicle. Chain drive was dominant over the drive shaft, and closed bodies were extremely rare. Drum brakes were introduced by Renault in 1902. The next year, Dutch designer Jacobus Spijker built the first four-wheel drive racing car; it never competed and it would be 1965 and the Jensen FF before four-wheel drive was used on a production car.\n\nWithin a few years, a dizzying assortment of technologies were being used by hundreds of producers all over the western world. Steam, electricity, and petrol/gasoline-powered automobiles competed for decades, with petrol/gasoline internal combustion engines achieving dominance by the 1910s. Dual- and even quad-engine cars were designed, and engine displacement ranged to more than a dozen litres. Many modern advances, including gas/electric hybrids, multi-valve engines, overhead camshafts, and four-wheel drive, were attempted, and discarded at this time.\n\nInnovation was not limited to the vehicles themselves. Increasing numbers of cars propelled the growth of the petroleum industry, as well as the development of technology to produce gasoline (replacing kerosene and coal oil) and of improvements in heat-tolerant mineral oil lubricants (replacing vegetable and animal oils).\n\nThere were social effects, also. Music would be made about cars, such as \"In My Merry Oldsmobile\" (a tradition that continues) while, in 1896, William Jennings Bryan would be the first presidential candidate to campaign in a car (a donated Mueller), in Decatur, Illinois. Three years later, Jacob German would start a tradition for New York City cabdrivers when he sped down Lexington Avenue, at the \"reckless\" speed of . Also in 1899, Akron, Ohio, adopted the first self-propelled paddy wagon.\n\nBy 1900, the early centers of national automotive industry developed in many countries, including Belgium (home to Vincke, which copied Benz; Germain, a pseudo-Panhard; and Linon and Nagant, both based on the Gobron-Brillié), Switzerland (led by Fritz Henriod, Rudolf Egg, Saurer, Johann Weber, and Lorenz Popp), Vagnfabrik AB in Sweden, Hammel (by A. F. Hammel and H. U. Johansen at Copenhagen, in Denmark, which only built one car, ca. 1886), Irgens (starting in Bergen, Norway, in 1883, but without success), Italy (where FIAT started in 1899), and as far afield as Australia (where Pioneer set up shop in 1898, with an already archaic paraffin-fuelled centre-pivot-steered wagon). Meanwhile, the export trade had begun, with Koch exporting cars and trucks from Paris to Tunisia, Egypt, Iran, and the Dutch East Indies. Motor cars were also exported very early to British colonies and the first motor car was exported to India in 1897.\n\nThroughout the veteran car era, the automobile was seen more as a novelty than as a genuinely useful device. Breakdowns were frequent, fuel was difficult to obtain, roads suitable for traveling were scarce, and rapid innovation meant that a year-old car was nearly worthless. Major breakthroughs in proving the usefulness of the automobile came with the historic long-distance drive of Bertha Benz in 1888, when she traveled more than from Mannheim to Pforzheim, to make people aware of the potential of the vehicles her husband, Karl Benz, manufactured, and after Horatio Nelson Jackson's successful transcontinental drive across the United States in 1903. Lots of older cars made were made with an assembly line which would help mass-produce cars which some companies still use today because it's more efficient.\n\nThis period lasted from roughly 1905 through to 1914 and the beginning of World War I. It is generally referred to as the Edwardian era, but in the United States is often known as the Brass era from the widespread use of brass in vehicles during this time.\n\nWithin the 15 years that make up this era, the various experimental designs and alternate power systems would be marginalised. Although the modern touring car had been invented earlier, it was not until Panhard et Levassor's \"Système Panhard\" was widely licensed and adopted that recognisable and standardised automobiles were created. This system specified front-engined, rear-wheel drive internal combustion engined cars with a sliding gear transmission. Traditional coach-style vehicles were rapidly abandoned, and buckboard runabouts lost favour with the introduction of tonneaus and other less-expensive touring bodies.\n\nBy 1906, steam car development had advanced, and they were among the fastest road vehicles in that period.\n\nThroughout this era, development of automotive technology was rapid, due in part to hundreds of small manufacturers competing to gain the world's attention. Key developments included the electric ignition system (by dynamotor on the Arnold in 1898, though Robert Bosch, 1903, tends to get the credit), independent suspension (actually conceived by Bollée in 1873), and four-wheel brakes (by the Arrol-Johnston Company of Scotland in 1909). Leaf springs were widely used for suspension, though many other systems were still in use, with angle steel taking over from armored wood as the frame material of choice. Transmissions and throttle controls were widely adopted, allowing a variety of cruising speeds, though vehicles generally still had discrete speed settings, rather than the infinitely variable system familiar in cars of later eras. Safety glass also made its debut, patented by John Wood in England in 1905. (It would not become standard equipment until 1926, on a Rickenbacker.)\n\nBetween 1907 and 1912 in the United States, the high-wheel motor buggy (resembling the horse buggy of before 1900) was in its heyday, with over seventy-five makers including Holsman (Chicago), IHC (Chicago), and Sears (which sold \"via\" catalog); the high-wheeler would be killed by the Model T. In 1912, Hupp (in the United States, supplied by Hale & Irwin) and BSA (in the UK) pioneered the use of all-steel bodies, joined in 1914 by Dodge (who produced Model T bodies). While it would be another two decades before all-steel bodies would be standard, the change would mean improved supplies of superior-quality wood for furniture makers.\n\nThe 1908 New York to Paris Race was the first circumnavigation of the world by automobile. German, French, Italian and American teams began in New York City 12 February 1908 with three of the competitors ultimately reaching Paris. The US built Thomas Flyer with George Schuster (driver) won the race covering 22,000 miles in 169 days. Also in 1908, the first South American automobile was built in Peru, the \"Grieve\". In 1909, Rambler became the first car company to equip its cars with a spare tire that was mounted on a fifth wheel.\n\nSome examples of cars of the period included:\n\nThe vintage era lasted from the end of World War I (1918), through to the Wall Street Crash at the end of 1929. During this period the front-engined car came to dominate with closed bodies and standardised controls becoming the norm. In 1919, 90% of cars sold were open; by 1929, 90% were closed. Development of the internal combustion engine continued at a rapid pace, with multi-valve and overhead camshaft engines produced at the high end, and V8, V12, and even V16 engines conceived for the ultra-rich. Also in 1919, hydraulic brakes were invented by Malcolm Loughead (co-founder of Lockheed); they were adopted by Duesenberg for their 1921 Model A. Three years later, Hermann Rieseler of Vulcan Motor invented the first automatic transmission, which had two-speed planetary gearbox, torque converter, and lockup clutch; it never entered production. (Its like would only become an available option in 1940.) Just at the end of the vintage era, tempered glass (now standard equipment in side windows) was invented in France. In this era the revolutionary ponton design of cars without fully articulated fenders, running boards and other non-compact ledge elements was introduced in small series but mass production of such cars was started much later (after WWII).\n\nAmerican auto companies in the 1920s expected they would soon sell six million cars a year, but did not do so until 1955. Numerous companies disappeared. Between 1922 and 1925, the number of U.S. passenger car builders decreased from 175 to 70. H. A. Tarantous, managing editor of \"MoToR Member Society of Automotive Engineers\", in a \"New York Times\" article from 1925, suggested many were unable to raise production and cope with falling prices (due to assembly line production), especially for low-priced cars. The new pyroxylin-based paints, eight cylinder engine, four wheel brakes, and balloon tires as the biggest trends for 1925.\n\nExamples of period vehicles:\n\nThe pre-war part of the classic era began with the Great Depression in 1930, and ended with the recovery after World War II, commonly placed at 1946. It was in this period that integrated fenders and fully closed bodies began to dominate sales, with the new saloon/sedan body style even incorporating a trunk or boot at the rear for storage. The old open-top runabouts, phaetons, and touring cars were largely phased out by the end of the classic era as wings, running boards, and headlights were gradually integrated with the body of the car.\n\nBy the 1930s, most of the mechanical technology used in today's automobiles had been invented, although some things were later \"re-invented\", and credited to someone else. For example, front-wheel drive was re-introduced by André Citroën with the launch of the \"Traction Avant\" in 1934, though it had appeared several years earlier in road cars made by Alvis and Cord, and in racing cars by Miller (and may have appeared as early as 1897). In the same vein, independent suspension was originally conceived by Amédée Bollée in 1873, but not put in production until appearing on the low-volume Mercedes-Benz 380 in 1933, which prodded American makers to use it more widely. In 1930, the number of auto manufacturers declined sharply as the industry consolidated and matured, thanks in part to the effects of the Great Depression.\n\nExemplary pre-war automobiles:\n\nA major change in automobile design since World War II was the popularity of ponton style, in which running boards were eliminated and fenders were incorporated into the body. Among the first representatives of the style were the Soviet GAZ-M20 Pobeda (1946), British Standard Vanguard (1947), United States Studebaker Champion and Kaiser (1946), as well as the Czech Tatra T600 Tatraplan (1946) and the Italian Cisitalia 220 sports car (1947).\n\nAutomobile design and production finally emerged from the military orientation and other shadow of war in 1949, the year that in the United States saw the introduction of high-compression V8 engines and modern bodies from General Motors' Oldsmobile and Cadillac brands. Hudson introduced the \"step-down\" design with the 1948 Commodore, which placed the passenger compartment down inside the perimeter of the frame, that was one of the first new-design postwar cars made and featured trend-setting slab-side styling. The unibody/strut-suspended 1951 Ford Consul joined the 1948 Morris Minor and 1949 Rover P4 in the automobile market in the United Kingdom. In Italy, Enzo Ferrari was beginning his 250 series, just as Lancia introduced the revolutionary V6-powered Aurelia.\n\nThroughout the 1950s, engine power and vehicle speeds rose, designs became more integrated and artful, and automobiles were marketed internationally. Alec Issigonis' Mini and Fiat's 500 diminutive cars were introduced in Europe, while the similar kei car class became popular in Japan. The Volkswagen Beetle continued production after Hitler and began exports to other nations, including the United States. At the same time, Nash introduced the Nash Rambler, the first successful modern compact car made in the United States, while the standard models produced by the \"Big Three\" domestic automakers grew ever larger in size, featuring increasing amounts of chrome trim, and luxury was exemplified by the Cadillac Eldorado Brougham. The markets in Europe expanded with new small-sized automobiles, as well as expensive grand tourers (GT), like the Ferrari America.\n\nThe market changed in the 1960s, as the United States \"Big Three\" automakers began facing competition from imported cars, the European makers adopted advanced technologies and Japan emerged as a car-producing nation. Japanese companies began to export some of their more popular selling cars in Japan internationally, such as the Toyota Corolla, Toyota Corona, Nissan Sunny, and Nissan Bluebird in the mid-1960s. The success of American Motors' compact-sized Rambler models spurred GM and Ford to introduce their own downsized cars in 1960. Performance engines became a focus of marketing by United States automakers, exemplified by the era's muscle cars. In 1964, the Ford Mustang developed a new market segment, the pony car. New models to compete with the Mustang included the Chevrolet Camaro, AMC Javelin, and Plymouth Barracuda.\n\nCaptive imports and badge engineering increased in the United States and the UK as amalgamated groups such as the British Motor Corporation consolidated the market. BMC's space-saving and trend-setting transverse engined, front-wheel-drive, independent suspension and monocoque bodied Mini, which first appeared in 1959, was marketed under the Austin and Morris names, until Mini became a marque in its own right in 1969. Competition increased, with Studebaker, a pioneering automaker, shutting down, and the trend for consolidation reached Italy where niche makers like Maserati, Ferrari, and Lancia were acquired by larger companies. By the end of the decade, the number of automobile marques had been greatly reduced.\n\nTechnology developments included the widespread use of independent suspensions, wider application of fuel injection, and an increasing focus on safety in automotive design. Innovations during the 1960s included NSU's Wankel engine, the gas turbine, and the turbocharger. Of these, only the last endured, pioneered by General Motors, and adopted by BMW and Saab, later seeing mass-market use during the 1980s by Chrysler. Mazda continued developing its Wankel engine, in spite of problems in longevity, emissions, and fuel economy. Other Wankel licensees, including Mercedes-Benz and GM, never put their designs into production because of engineering and manufacturing problems, as well as the lessons from the 1973 oil crisis.\n\nThe 1970s were turbulent years for automakers and buyers with major events reshaping the industry such as the 1973 oil crisis, stricter automobile emissions control and safety requirements, increasing exports by the Japanese and European automakers, as well as growth in inflation and the stagnant economic conditions in many nations. Smaller-sized cars grew in popularity. The United States saw the establishment of the subcompact segment with the introduction of the AMC Gremlin, followed by the Chevrolet Vega and Ford Pinto. The station wagons (estate, break, kombi, universal) body design was popular, as well as increasing sales of non-commercial all-wheel drive off-road vehicles.\n\nTo the end of the 20th century, the United States Big Three (GM, Ford, and Chrysler) partially lost their leading position, Japan became for a while the world's leader of car production and cars began to be mass manufactured in new Asian, East European, and other countries.\n\nNotable exemplary post-war cars:\n\nThe modern era is normally defined as the 40 years preceding the current year. The modern era has been one of increasing standardisation, platform sharing, and computer-aided design—to reduce costs and development time—and of increasing use of electronics for both engine management and entertainment systems.\n\nSome particular contemporary developments are the proliferation of front- and all-wheel drive, the adoption of the diesel engine, and the ubiquity of fuel injection. Most modern passenger cars are front-wheel-drive monocoque or unibody designs, with transversely mounted engines.\n\nBody styles have changed as well in the modern era. Three types, the hatchback, sedan, and sport utility vehicle, dominate today's market. All originally emphasised practicality, but have mutated into today's high-powered luxury crossover SUV, sports wagon[ and two-volume Large MPV. The rise of pickup trucks in the United States and SUVs worldwide has changed the face of motoring with these \"trucks\" coming to command more than half of the world automobile market. There was also the introduction of the MPV class (smaller non-commercial passenger minivans), among the first of which were the French Renault Espace and the Chrysler minivan versions in the United States.\n\nThe modern era has also seen rapidly improving fuel efficiency and engine output. The automobile emissions concerns have been eased with computerised engine management systems.\n\nThe financial crisis of 2007–2008 cut almost a third of light vehicle sales from Chrysler, Toyota, Ford, and Nissan. It also subtracted about a fourth of Honda's sales and about a seventh of sales from General Motors.\n\nSince 2009, China has become the world's largest car manufacturer with production greater than Japan, the United States, and all of Europe. Besides large growth of car production in Asian and other countries, there has been growth in transnational corporate groups, with the production of transnational automobiles sharing the same platforms as well as badge engineering or re-badging to suit different markets and consumer segments.\n\nSince the end of the 20th century, several award competitions for cars and trucks have become widely known, such as European Car of the Year, Car of the Year Japan, North American Car of the Year, World Car of the Year, Truck of the Year, and International Car of the Year. Also, a Car of the Century award was held in which in the US the Ford Model T was named as most influential car of the 20th century.\n\nExemplary modern cars:\n\nIconic modern cars include\n\n\n"}

It is used to treat muscle pain and to help with motor control in Parkinson's disease, but has largely been superseded by newer drugs. This substance is considered a dirty drug due to its multiple mechanism of action in different pathways. It was discovered and developed in the 1940s.\n\nAs of 2015, the cost for a typical month of medication in the United States is US$25 to 50.\n\nOrphenadrine is used to relieve pain caused by muscle injuries like strains and sprains in combination with rest and physical therapy. A 2004 review found fair evidence that orphenadrine is effective for acute back or neck pain, but found insufficient evidence to establish the relative efficacy of the drug in relation to other drugs in the study.\n\nOrphenadrine and other muscle relaxants are sometimes used to treat pain arising from rheumatoid arthritis but there is no evidence they are effective for that purpose.\n\nA 2003 Cochrane Review of the use of anticholinergic drugs to improve motor function in Parkinson's disease found that as a class, the drugs are useful for that purpose; it identified one single-site randomised, cross-over study of orphenadrine vs placebo. Orphenadrine and other anticholinergics have largely been superseded by other drugs; they have a use in alleviating motor function symptoms, and appear to help about 20% of people with Parkinson's.\n\nOrphenadrine has the side effects of the other common antihistamines in large part. Stimulation is somewhat more common than with other related antihistamines, and is especially common in the elderly. Common side effects include dry mouth, dizziness, drowsiness, constipation, urine retention, blurred vision, and headache. Its use in Parkinson's is especially limited by these factors.\n\nPeople with glaucoma, digestive problems such as peptic ulcers or bowel obstruction, or sphincter relaxation disorders, or with enlarged prostate, bladder problems, or myasthenia gravis, should not take this drug.\n\nOrphenadrine is known to have this pharmacology:\n\n\nGeorge Rieveschl was a professor of chemistry at the University of Cincinnati and led a research program working on antihistamines. In 1943, one of his students, Fred Huber, synthesized diphenhydramine. Rieveschl worked with Parke-Davis to test the compound, and the company licensed the patent from him. In 1947 Parke-Davis hired him as their Director of Research. While he was there, he led the development of orphenadrine, an analog of diphenhydramine.\n\nPrior to the development of amantadine in the late 1960s and then other drugs, anticholinergics like orphenadrine were the mainstay of Parkinson's treatment.\n\nOrphenadrine has been available as a citrate salt and a hydrochloride salt; in the US as of February 2016 the citrate form was available in tablets, extended release tablets, compounding powder and by injection for acute use in a hospital setting.\n\nOrphenadrine is often available mixed with aspirin, paracetamol/acetaminophen, ibuprofen, caffeine, and/or codeine.\n\nThe brand names Norflex and Norgesic are formulations of the citrate salt of orphenadrine and Disipal is the hydrochloride salt.\n\nOrphenadrine is a derivative of diphenhydramine with a methyl group added to one of the phenyl rings.\n\nTofenacin is the \"N\"-desmethyl analogue of orphenadrine and an antidepressant.\n\nOrphenadrine has a chiral center and two enantiomers.

She was also the sister of Emperors Basil II Bulgaroktonos (The Bulgar-Slayer) and Constantine VIII.

Anna's hand was considered such a prize that some theorize that Vladimir became Christian just to marry her.\n\nAnna did not wish to marry Vladimir and expressed deep distress on her way to her wedding. Vladimir was impressed by Byzantine religious practices; this factor, along with his marriage to Anna, led to his decision to convert to Eastern Christianity.

By marriage to Grand Prince Vladimir, Anna became Grand Princess of Kiev, but in practice, she was referred to as Queen or Czarina, probably as a sign of her membership of the Imperial Byzantine House. Anna participated actively in the Christianization of Rus: she acted as the religious adviser of Vladimir and founded a few convents and churches herself.

{"id": "1983348", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1983348", "title": "Dan Spivey", "text": "Dan Spivey\n\nDaniel Eugene Spivey (born October 14, 1952) is an American retired professional wrestler best known under the ring names \"Dangerous\" Dan Spivey, Dangerous Dan The Left Hand Man, Danny Spivey, and Waylon Mercy, and initially worked under the name Starship Eagle. Throughout his career he has worked extensively for World Championship Wrestling, the World Wrestling Federation, and All Japan Pro Wrestling. He retired from wrestling in 1995 due to injuries and now works in alcoholism counselling in his native Florida.\n\nSpivey spent a lot of his career as part of various tag teams and is especially known in the U.S. for teaming with Sid Vicious as \"The Skyscrapers in WCW and teaming with Mike Rotunda to form The American Express in WWF. He started his career teaming with Starship Coyote, collectively known as \"American Starship\". In Japan he teamed with various wrestlers over the years winning the World Tag Team Championship with Stan Hansen and teaming with Johnny Ace for long periods of time.\n\nHis last wrestling persona, Waylon Mercy, was inspired by Robert De Niro's portrayal of Max Cady in the 1991 remake of \"Cape Fear\". While he only worked a few matches under that name, he later inspired the creation of the Bray Wyatt character as Spivey worked with Windham Rotunda to initially develop it.\n\nSpivey was born in Tampa, Florida. He attended the University of Georgia, where he played football for the Georgia Bulldogs for three seasons as a defensive end and was named an All-American football player in his sophomore year. Spivey aimed to play football professionally and was drafted by the New York Jets, but was forced to change his plans after suffering a severe knee injury in his junior year. Spivey spent several years working in a number of jobs in Tampa before meeting professional wrestler Dusty Rhodes, who offered to train him to wrestle.\n\nSpivey was trained as a wrestler by Dusty Rhodes, the then-booker for Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF), and made his debut in 1983. Spivey and Scott Hall formed a tag team in CWF called \"American Starship\". Spivey adopted the ring name \"Eagle\" and Hall the ring name \"Coyote\". The men wore furry boots, bright masks and silver pants.\n\nIn 1984, Rhodes moved from Championship Wrestling from Florida to the Charlotte, North Carolina-based Jim Crockett Promotions, bringing Spivey and Hall with him. Initially, American Starship worked only sporadically. At first they were booked so sparingly that the two were given a job for the Charlotte Orioles (which Jim Crockett owned at the time) as part of the ground crew. When the two men did get into the ring it was with little success. The highlight of their stay in Jim Crockett Promotions was being defeated by Arn and Ole Anderson when the rookies challenged for the NWA National Tag Team Championship.\n\nAfter working in MACW the duo joined Bob Geigel's NWA Central States territory based in Kansas City in 1985. The duo had a shot at the NWA Central States Tag Team Champions Marty Jannetty and \"Bulldog\" Bob Brown but did not manage to win the titles. Spivey's stay in the Central States territory was short-lived, according to Scott Hall Spivey did not like Kansas City. Spivey returned to the Carolinas where he worked as \"American Starship\" Eagle.\n\nIn the fall of 1985, Spivey signed with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and started wrestling without a mask and under his real name. Spivey was brought in to team with Mike Rotunda as The U.S. Express after Barry Windham left the federation.\n\nThe team had their first match together on November 1, 1985 less than a month after Spivey joined the WWF. The team was sometimes billed as \"The American Express\", but most people referred to them as the U.S. Express II since the patriotic gimmick of the original U.S. Express was recycled with Spivey taking Barry Windham's place. The team continued the U.S. Express' feud with the Dream Team, but once they were proven unsuccessful, the two did not team from January to May as Rotundo briefly left the WWF. During this time Spivey took part in the WrestleMania 2 \"Wrestlers and Football players\" Battle Royal. Spivey was eliminated by The Iron Sheik without much fanfare. Once the American Express reunited, they feuded with The Moondogs, The Hart Foundation, and The Islanders, whom the team faced in their last match together on February 9, 1987.\n\nNot long before Rotundo left the WWF, Spivey began to be billed as \"Golden Boy\" Danny Spivey which continued for his singles run after Rotundo left. His in-ring appearance at the time led to many fans labelling him a Hulk Hogan clone. As the \"Golden Boy\", Spivey wrestled in yellow trunks and boots, this colour choice combined with his height, build and blond hair saw him resemble the then WWF Champion. Spivey took part in the 1986 King of the Ring tournament, losing to Nikolai Volkoff in the first round. He also tried a new tag team partner. In March 1987 Spivey teamed with Tito Santana to unsuccessfully challenge the Hart Foundation for the tag team titles. Spivey was also part of the 1987 King of the Ring. This time he lost to Rick Martel in the first round. Spivey stayed with the WWF until the spring of 1988, becoming a heel and competing mainly against such low carders as Lanny Poffo and Outback Jack.\n\nIn 1991, Spivey testified that Dr George Zaharian had illegally supplied him with anabolic steroids in the late 1980s. Zaharian was ultimately found guilty.\n\nAfter working exclusively in the U.S. since his debut, Spivey started to tour with All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) in the summer of 1988 and kept touring with the company every year until 1995, when he signed with the WWF. In his first tour, Spivey gained ring experience by competing with Japanese wrestling legend Genichiro Tenryu. Spivey also teamed with Johnny Ace, a man he would team with many times during his Japanese tours.\n\nIn early 1989, Spivey returned to the NWA and Jim Crockett. Spivey was made a member of The Varsity Club as a replacement for Rick Steiner, who left the group. Spivey's background as a football player at the University of Georgia was touched upon to lend credibility to his inclusion in the group. While in the Varsity Club, Spivey feuded with Rick Steiner and the Road Warriors, acting more as back-up while former tag team partner Mike Rotunda and Steve Williams were pushed as the stars of the group. When the Varsity Club disbanded, Spivey came under the management of ex-referee Teddy Long and started teaming with newcomer Sid Vicious under the name of The Skyscrapers. The Skyscrapers' (so named due to their height with Spivey at 6'8\" and Vicious at 6'9\") first taste of success came at the Great American Bash pay-per-view, where they first co-won a Two-Ring King of the Hill Battle Royal with Sid being the survivor in one ring and Spivey surviving in the other. The rules called for the two to fight each other but manager Teddy Long convinced them to shake hands and share the prize money. Later in the night, the Skyscrapers defeated The Dynamic Dudes due to their overwhelming size and power.\n\nThe Skyscrapers quickly became involved in a feud with the Road Warriors, sparked by Teddy Long's actions while he was still a referee. The two teams were very evenly matched in power and intensity, creating a series of matches that did not favor one team over the other. Spivey and Vicious were disqualified against the Road Warriors at Halloween Havoc. Shortly after Halloween Havoc, the Skyscrapers faced the Steiner Brothers at Clash of the Champions IX in a hard hitting match. Sid Vicious suffered a punctured lung due to a broken rib. With Vicious out of action, Teddy Long brought in another tall newcomer in the same mold as Sid Vicious and Dan Spivey and dubbed him \"Mean\" Mark Callous. The New Skyscrapers immediately picked up the feud with the Road Warriors and kept on having inconclusive matches with them. At Clash of the Champions X the Skyscrapers finally got the better of the Road Warriors, not in the match, but afterwards when they beat the Road Warriors down. At this point in time, no one had ever been able to physically dominate the Road Warriors, something that pointed that big things had been planned for the Skyscrapers. However, in the days before the scheduled Chicago Street Fight at WrestleWar 1990, Dan Spivey suddenly left WCW, leaving the bookers to scramble for a replacement. Spivey stated in a shoot interview that he left the company over money issues, as well as his dislike of the Road Warriors themselves for taking what he perceived as liberties with his tag-team partner \"Mean\" Mark Callous.\n\nWhile working for the NWA as one of the Skyscrapers, Spivey also competed in his home state of Florida, winning the NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship in late 1989. However, this title win was not referred to on NWA Television. Spivey would go on to hold the title until July 1992, when he lost it to Lou Perez. Spivey also kept on touring with AJPW while working for the NWA, mainly teaming with Stan Hansen. Spivey and Hansen formed a very popular Gaijin team that almost won AJPW's \"World's Strongest Tag Determination League\" in 1990. By the end of 1990, Spivey returned to WCW television. The Skyscrapers briefly reunited at Starrcade (1990) as he and Sid Vicious defeated The Big Cat and The Motor City Madman.\n\nWith Sid Vicious being part of the Four Horsemen, the Skyscraper reunion was short-lived. Instead, Spivey started to focus on his singles career in WCW, challenging WCW U.S. Champion \"The Total Package\" Lex Luger at the February 24, 1991 PPV WrestleWar. Spivey did not win the title, and he did not get another high-profile title opportunity while with the company. On April 18, 1991 Dan Spivey and Stan Hansen captured the World Tag Team Championship from Terry Gordy and Steve Williams in Tokyo, Japan. Spivey and Hansen even brought their successful tag team to WCW during this time. On June 22, 1991, Spivey and Hansen were booked to face Rick Steiner and Tom Zenk and Spivey was told to lose the match to Zenk. Spivey refused since the duo were the World Tag Team Champions. After further discussions, Dan Spivey once again left WCW.\n\nSpivey and Hansen would lose the tag-team titles back to Gordy and Williams. After the title loss, Spivey started to team with other wrestlers, mainly with Johnny Ace, but also linked up with Jim Brunzell, Kendall Windham and Jim Steele. Spivey managed to mend fences with WCW enough to work with them once more during the summer of 1992. His biggest match during this time was his appearance at Starrcade where he teamed with Van Hammer to defeat Johnny B. Badd and Cactus Jack to advance in the \"Lethal Lottery\". Spivey was eliminated from the main event battle royal by eventual winner The Great Muta.\n\nBetween 1990 and 1995, Spivey made regular American appearances for Herb Abrams' Universal Wrestling Federation (UWF). He defeated Johnny Ace at UWF's Blackjack Brawl to become the only UWF Americas Champion.\n\nSpivey rejoined the WWF in June 1995, adopting the name \"Waylon Mercy\" in a character based on Robert De Niro's portrayal of Max Cady in the 1991 remake of \"Cape Fear\". Like Cady, he had jet black hair, wore white attire with a Hawaiian shirt, and sported several strange tattoos, including one of a dagger on his forehead (Spivey's were temporary). The character was introduced through a series of vignettes that always had Spivey speaking in a calm yet sinister manner. In the final vignette before premiering the character in-ring, Spivy predicted that soon, \"Lives are gonna be in Waylon Mercy's hands,\" a phrase that would later feature in his entrance music.\n\nSpivey portrayed a heel despite his character acting as a peaceful southern gentleman outside the ring. Waylon would shake the hands of the fans and thank them for coming to see him wrestle, his opponent, and even the referee before his matches. However, once the bell rang, he became vicious, insincerely apologizing for actions such as kicking or choking a downed opponent. Mercy's finishing move saw him apply a sleeper hold as he revealed a wide-eyed, insane expression. Once the bell rang, he would return to his \"peaceful southern gentleman\" act.\n\nMercy was pushed upon his debut with victories over numerous enhancement talents (including a young Jeff Hardy), as well as established stars such as Bob Holly, The 1-2-3 Kid, and Doink The Clown. Soon after, he competed in matches with the top faces of the WWF at the time, such as Bret Hart, Razor Ramon, and WWF World Heavyweight Champion Diesel. Spivey's only pay-per-view appearance as Waylon Mercy came at In Your House 3, where he lost to Savio Vega. Spivey defeated Diesel by countout in his last televised match.\n\nSpivey retired in 1995 due to injuries. After retiring, Spivey briefly attempted to forge a career as a fashion model. He went on to work for Spivey Underground Utility Construction Company, a construction company owned by his family.\nIn 2014, Windham Rotunda revealed that his character of Bray Wyatt was given to him by Spivey who was attending the WWE Performance Center at the time, and shares a number of similarities with the Waylon Mercy character.\n\nOn August 1, 2015, Spivey, at age 62, who hadn't wrestled since 1995 due to injuries, returned to the ring for Dory Funk Jr.'s !BANG! promotion. Spivey and Funk worked a 10-man Japanese Banzai match.\n\nSpivey was arrested on July 14, 2007 for driving under the influence in Odessa, Florida. He was released on $500 bond. He became sober in April 2009. He now owns his own company, Spivey's Sober Companions, in Odessa and Stamford, Connecticut. Spivey is also the Ambassador for the breakfast restaurant chain, The Breakfast Station in Florida.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1983354", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1983354", "title": "Enfield revolver", "text": "Enfield revolver\n\nThe Enfield Revolver was a self-extracting British handgun designed and manufactured at the government-owned Royal Small Arms Factory in Enfield; initially in the .476 calibre (actually 11.6 mm)\n\nThe .476 calibre Enfield Mk I and Mk II revolvers were the official sidearm of both the British Army and the North-West Mounted Police, as well as being issued to many other Colonial units throughout the British Empire. The term \"Enfield Revolver\" is not applied to Webley Mk VI revolvers built by RSAF Enfield between 1923 and 1926.\n\nThe Enfield No. 2 is an unrelated .38 calibre revolver that was the standard sidearm of British and Commonwealth forces during World War II.\n\nThe first models of Enfield revolver were the .422-calibre Mark I (c.1880) and the .476-calibre Mark II (c.1882). They were the official British military sidearms from 1880 to 1887. \n\nThe .476 Enfield cartridge for which the Enfield Mk I/Mk II was chambered fired a lead bullet, and was loaded with of black powder. The cartridge was found to be underpowered, however, during the Afghan War and other contemporary Colonial conflicts, as it lacked the stopping power believed necessary for military use at the time.\n\nUnlike most other self-extracting revolvers (such as the Webley service revolvers or the Smith & Wesson No. 3 Revolver), the Enfield Mk I/Mk II was complicated to unload, having an Owen Jones selective extraction/ejection system which was supposed to allow the firer to eject spent cartridges, whilst retaining live rounds in the cylinder. The Enfield Mk I/Mk II had a hinged frame, and when the barrel was unlatched, the cylinder would move forward, operating the extraction system and allowing the spent cartridges to simply fall out. The idea was that the cylinder moved forward far enough to permit fired cases to be completely extracted (and ejected by gravity), but not far enough to permit live cartridges (i.e., those with projectiles still present, and thus longer in overall length) from being removed in the same manner.\n\nThe system was obsolete as soon as the Enfield Mk I was introduced, especially as it required reloading one round at a time via a gate in the side (much like the Colt Single Action Army or the Nagant M1895 revolvers). Combined with the cumbersome nature of the revolver, and a tendency for the action to foul or jam when extracting cartridges, the Enfield Mk I/Mk II revolvers were never popular and eventually replaced in 1889 by the .455 calibre Webley Mk I revolver.\n\nThe Enfield Mk. II was the issue sidearm of the North-West Mounted Police in Canada from 1883 until 1911. NWMP Commissioner Acheson G. Irvine ordered 200 Mark IIs in 1882, priced at C$15.75 each, which were shipped by London's Montgomery and Workman in November that year, arriving in December. They replaced the Adams. \n\nIrvine liked them so much that, in one of his final acts as Commissioner, he ordered another 600, which were delivered in September 1885. His replacement, Lawrence W. Herchmer, reported the force was entirely outfitted with Enfields (in all 1,079 were provided) and was pleased with them, but concerned about the .476 round being too potent. \n\nThe first batch was stamped \"NWMP-CANADA\" (issue number between) after delivery; later purchases were not. They were top-break single- or double-action, and fitted with lanyard rings. Worn spindle arms would fail to hold empty cases on ejection, and worn pivot pins could cause barrels to become loose, resulting in inaccuracy. Its deep rifling would allow firing of slugs of between diameter. Complaints began arising as early as 1887, influenced in part by the British switching to Webleys, and by 1896, hinge wear and barrel loosening were a real issue.\n\nBeginning in late 1904, the Mark II began to be phased out in favor of the .45 calibre Colt New Service revolver, but the Enfield remained in service until 1911.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1983356", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1983356", "title": "Maxima (comics)", "text": "Maxima (comics)\n\nMaxima () is a fictional comic book character in DC Comics. She is known for searching for mates among Earth's superpowered male population; as a result, Superman becomes her obsession. Morally ambiguous, she occasionally serves both as an adversary for Superman and a superheroine working as a member of the Justice League.\n\nMaxima first appeared in \"Action Comics\" #645 (Sept 1989) and was created by writer Roger Stern and artist George Pérez.\n\nOldest child of the Royal family of the planet Almerac, the fiery-tempered Maxima came to Earth in search of a suitable mate to sire her heir, leaving behind Ultraa, her betrothed. Maxima's first appearance in Metropolis was not actually her but a simulacrum of her brought to Earth by her servant Sazu, who took it upon herself to convince Superman to be her mate. The simulacrum was destroyed and Sazu imprisoned. The real Maxima then appeared to free Sazu and came face to face with Superman. She and Superman, she argued, were genetically compatible; she could \"give him what no Earth woman could - children\". She was infuriated when Superman rejected her offer, saying he had no desire to father despots.\n\nMaxima later found herself reluctantly working with Brainiac who had destroyed Almerac with the Warworld. She turned against him, and helped Earth's heroes defeat him, subsequently joining a reformed Justice League for her own reasons. When the League helped her save Almerac from Starbreaker, the planet's ruling council exiled her. As a Leaguer, she helped in the fight against Doomsday, and when that version of the League disbanded, she became a member of Captain Atom's Extreme Justice team. She considered Captain Atom as a potential mate, but he was not interested. During the period of her flirtation with Captain Atom, a jilted Ultraa angrily attacked him. Maxima eventually stopped the brawl and sent Ultraa back to Almerac. She later had a brief fling with another teammate, Amazing-Man, which lasted until the team was dissolved. While part of the Extreme Justice team she joined with other heroes on a trip to Hell itself, mistakenly believing that Superman was trapped there. During the battle, Maxima fell and was lost in one of the 'Nine rings'. She was sent back to Earth when Neron, the current ruler of Hell, was subdued.\n\nShe offered herself sexually to Superman again, hoping that her recent good deeds would offset her earlier ruthlessness. Superman, now married to Lois Lane, was even less interested in her proposal than before. Angry and humiliated, she joined the Superman Revenge Squad. She swore that Superman had rejected, humbled and humiliated her for the last time, and threatened that the next time they meet, it would truly be war.\n\nHowever, in her next appearance, during the buildup to the \"Our Worlds at War\" crossover, Maxima and the 'Chosen People of Almerac', as she phrased it, showed up in Earth's solar system where they met up with Superman and fellow JLA member, Green Lantern. Superman and Green Lantern were just beginning to investigate the disturbing disappearance of Pluto and the even more distressing ion engine trail associated with Warworld, when they stumbled across Maxima, her people, and the supervillain Massacre.\n\nAfter a battle full of wounded pride, Maxima eventually conceded her position when Almerac's rendezvous showed up using a Boom Tube. She explained that she was leading her people to safety from Imperiex, the force that conquered her world. Massacre had seemed to meet his death, however, somehow Maxima came across him and described her association in these words: \"\"Massacre serves only me now.\"\" To save her people, she allied herself with Darkseid's son, Grayven, who was taking them to regions unknown. This was also being undertaken without the knowledge of Darkseid. Maxima left Superman with the following words: \"\"Mark my words, when Imperiex comes for your precious homeworld, you'll see alliances you've never dreamed of.\"\"\n\nAll that Maxima warned eventually came to fruition as she and a myriad of other characters (both heroes and villains) formed alliances with Earth and Apokolips in an effort to destroy Imperiex.\n\nMaxima ultimately met her demise in a heroic effort to put her ship between the destructive beams of Brainiac 13's Warworld which would have resulted in the destruction of the entire universe, making amends with Superman prior to after he had rescued her despite her animosity over his constant rejection of her.\n\nIn September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, a younger, revamped Maxima is briefly introduced in \"Supergirl\" issue #36 as a distinguished member of the Crucible Academy, an intergalactic organization that trains some planets' finest specimens to become their planets' protectors. She spends the next few issues bonding with Kara before eventually revealing in issue #40 that she is emotionally and sexually attracted to Kara; Maxima's homosexuality is the reason she left her homeworld and the demands of her culture to find a heterosexual partner to produce children with.\n\nAn alternate, adult Maxima who resembles the more traditional pre-\"Flashpoint\" version of the character in both appearance and personality later showed up as a villain. The adult Maxima is a former Almeracian soldier who kidnapped the younger Maxima and stole her name after believing that the girl's unwillingness to deny her homosexuality by taking on a male partner made her unworthy of her royal title and heritage. The new Maxima was later defeated and imprisoned by the combined might of Supergirl, Superwoman and the younger Maxima.\n\nOverall, portrayal of Maxima varied by writer. In her appearances in the various Superman titles, Maxima was typically depicted as a haughty and shallow individual with only self-centered motivations, lacking any real depth as a character. By contrast, in her appearances in the comic book series \"Extreme Justice\" and \"Steel\", Maxima was developed as an individual with a warrior's sense of honor and a strong countenance of noble pride that had its humorous moments in relation to other characters. This was evident during \"Extreme Justice\" #10 and #11, where Maxima hosted the bachelorette party for Captain Atom's fiancé, Plastique, wearing a stylish and elegant \"red carpet\" dress while everyone else wore jeans to the event that was held in the party room of a humble Tex-Mex restaurant. This occurred again in later issues of that series, where she is visibly uncomfortable from seeing newly joined members, Zan and Jayna, gorge themselves on junk food at a mall food court.\n\nAs a scion of the Blood Royale of Almerac, Maxima commands a vast array of immense psionic powers that come from selective breeding and years of gene therapy which she can utilize in a variety of ways. In her first face to face encounter with Superman she displayed a high level of psionic powers, such as psychokinesis and seemingly hypnotic mind control. Maxima can use her psionic powers to give herself superhuman strength, enough to prove an effective opponent in hand-to-hand combat with a resurrected Superman or hold her own against the even stronger Doomsday. Maxima can increase her strength to an unlimited degree, pushing her past those in her tier. She also has enhanced stamina, as well as having such a degree of superhuman speed that she could easily move faster than the speed of light and proven herself to be able to keep up with speedsters such as the Flash. Through skillful application of her psionic powers Maxima has been shown to emit powerful optical beams that can severely injure even Superman, take out Orion with one bolt, and she can create nearly impervious force fields. She is also capable of teleporting herself and others across vast distances, even from other worlds, which was demonstrated when she brought her adviser Sazu to Earth from a prison world. In the first battle with Doomsday in \"Adventures of Superman\" #498, Maxima is the only one in that incarnation of the Justice League besides Superman who was able to actually hurt and withstand blows from Doomsday. Her various abilities and powers make her a threat potentially for the entire Justice League.\n\nAn alternate history where Superman marries Maxima after Lois dies was presented as an Elseworlds story that was part of the \"Armageddon 2001\" crossover in which Waverider looked at possible futures of DC characters. In this scenario, Superman is overcome with grief from the death of his wife Lois Lane, after their unborn child causes her death from internal bleeding when it kicks in her womb. Apparently, even a half-Kryptonian child was too much for a normal Earth woman to bear. Blaming himself and grief-stricken, Superman exiles himself from Earth once again, and is ready to die in space when he comes across one of the many enemies of Almerac. He is saved by Maxima, who at this time is unwillingly engaged to the Krenon cyborg De'Cine. Following on the advice of her handmaiden Sazu, she pretends to become more tactful and 'nice' in order to win Superman's heart, but in the process, she truly falls in love with him. At the end, she and Superman leave Earth forever to protect it from a potential reprisal from the Krenon Empire after the death of De'Cine. As they leave, Maxima remarks what fine children they would have.\n\n\nMaxima appeared in the animated film \"\". She appears as a student from Korugar Academy competing in the Intergalactic Games. Also, she doesn't have speaking lines in film.\n\nMaxima debuted in Season 4, Episode 21 of DC Super Hero Girls \"Tamaranean Dance Club Part 1\", with the rest of Korugar Academy.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1983357", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1983357", "title": "Vijñāna", "text": "Vijñāna\n\nVijñāna (Sanskrit) or viññāa (Pāli) is translated as \"consciousness,\" \"life force,\" \"mind,\" or \"discernment.\"\n\nIn the Pāli Canon's \"Sutta Pitaka\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s first four nikāyas, \"viññāa\" is one of three overlapping Pali terms used to refer to the mind, the others being \"manas\" and \"citta\". Each is used in the generic and non-technical sense of \"mind\" in general, but the three are sometimes used in sequence to refer to one's mental processes as a whole. Their primary uses are, however, distinct.\n\nThis section considers the Buddhist concept primarily in terms of Early Buddhism's Pali literature as well as in the literature of other Buddhist schools.\n\nThroughout Pali literature, \"viññāa\" can be found as one of a handful of synonyms for the mental force that animates the otherwise inert material body.\nIn a number of Pali texts though, the term has a more nuanced and context-specific (or \"technical\") meaning. In particular, in the Pali Canon's \"Discourse Basket\" (\"Suttapitaka\"), \"viññāa\" (generally translated as \"consciousness\") is discussed in at least three related but different contexts:<br>\nIn the Pali Canon's Abhidhamma and in post-canonical Pali commentaries, consciousness (\"viññāa\") is further analyzed into 89 different states which are categorized in accordance with their kammic results.\n\nIn Buddhism, the six sense bases (Pali: '; Skt.: ') refer to the five physical sense organs (cf. receptive field) (belonging to the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body), the mind (referred to as the sixth sense base) and their associated objects (visual forms, sounds, odors, flavors, touch and mental objects). Based on the six sense bases, a number of mental factors arise including six \"types\" or \"classes\" of consciousness (\"viññāa-kāyā\"). More specifically, according to this analysis, the six types of consciousness are eye-consciousness (that is, consciousness based on the eye), ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness and mind-consciousness.\n\nIn this context, for instance, when an ear's receptive field (the proximal stimulus, more commonly known by Buddhists as a sense base, or sense organ) and sound (the distal stimulus, or sense object) are present, the associated (ear-related) consciousness arises. The arising of these three elements (\"dhātu\") – e.g. ear, sound and ear-consciousness – lead to the percept, known as \"contact\" and in turn causes a pleasant, unpleasant or neutral \"feeling\" to arise. It is from such feeling that \"craving\" arises. (See Fig. 1.)\n\nIn a discourse entitled, \"The All\" (\"Sabba Sutta\", SN 35.23), the Buddha states that there is no \"all\" outside of the six pairs of sense bases (that is, six internal and six external sense bases). The \"To Be Abandoned Discourse\" (\"Pahanaya Sutta\", SN 35.24) further expands the All to include first five aforementioned sextets (internal sense bases, external sense bases, consciousness, contact and feeling). In the famed \"Fire Sermon\" (\"Ādittapariyāya Sutta\", SN 35.28) the Buddha declares that \"the All is aflame\" with passion, aversion, delusion and suffering (\"dukkha\"); to obtain release from this suffering, one should become disenchanted with the All.\n\nHence, in this context, \"viññāa\" includes the following characteristics:\n\nIn Buddhism, consciousness (\"viññāa\") is one of the five classically defined experiential \"aggregates\" (Pali: \"khandha\"; Skt.: \"skandha\"). As illustrated (Fig. 2), the four other aggregates are material \"form\" (\"rupa\"), \"feeling\" or \"sensation\" (\"vedana\"), \"perception\" (\"sanna\"), and \"volitional formations\" or \"fabrications\" (\"sankhara\").\n\nIn SN 22.79, the Buddha distinguishes consciousness in the following manner:\nThis type of awareness appears to be more refined and introspective than that associated with the aggregate of perception (\"saññā\") which the Buddha describes in the same discourse as follows:\nSimilarly, in a 5th-century CE commentary, the Visuddhimagga, there is an extended analogy about a child, an adult villager and an expert \"money-changer\" seeing a heap of coins; the child's experience is likened to perception, the villager's experience to consciousness, and the money-changer's experience to true understanding (\"paňňā\").\nThus, in this context, \"consciousness\" denotes more than the irreducible subjective experience of sense data suggested in the discourses of \"the All\" (see prior section); it additionally entails a depth of awareness reflecting a degree of memory and recognition.\n\nAll of the aggregates are to be seen as empty of self-nature; that is, they arise dependent on causes (\"hetu\") and conditions (\"paticca\"). In this scheme, the cause for the arising of consciousness (\"viññāa\") is the arising of one of the other aggregates (physical or mental); and the arising of consciousness in turn gives rise to one or more of the mental (\"nāma\") aggregates. In this way, the chain of causation identified in the aggregate (\"khandha\") model overlaps the chain of conditioning in the Dependent Origination (\"paticcasamuppāda\") model.\n\nConsciousness (\"viññāa\") is the third of the traditionally enumerated Twelve Causes (\"nidāna\") of Dependent Origination (Pali: \"\"; Skt.: \"pratītyasamutpāda\"). Within the context of Dependent Origination, different canonical discourses represent different aspects of consciousness. The following aspects are traditionally highlighted:\n\nNumerous discourses state:\n\nIn three discourses in the Samyutta Nikaya, the Buddha highlights three particular manifestations of ' as particularly creating a \"basis for the maintenance of consciousness\" (') that could lead to future existence, to the perpetuation of bodily and mental processes, and to craving and its resultant suffering. As stated in the common text below (in English and Pali), these three manifestations are intending, planning and enactments of latent tendencies (\"obsessing\")\n\nThus, for instance, in the \"Intention Discourse\" (\"Cetanā Sutta\", SN 12.38), the Buddha more fully elaborates:\n\nThe language of the post-canonical Samyutta Nikaya commentary and subcommentary further affirm that this text is discussing the means by which \"kammic consciousness\" \"yield[s] fruit in one's mental continuum.\" In other words, certain intentional or obsessive acts on one's part inherently establish in present consciousness a basis for future consciousness's existence; in this way, the future existence is conditioned by certain aspects of the initial intention, including its wholesome and unwholesome qualities.\n\nConversely, in the \"Attached Discourse\" (\"Upaya Sutta\", SN 22.53), it states that if passion for the five aggregates (forms and mental processes) are abandoned then:\n\nNumerous discourses state:\nIn addition, a few discourses state that, simultaneously, the converse is true:\n\nIn the \"Sheaves of Reeds Discourse\" (\"Nalakalapiyo Sutta\", SN 12.67), Ven. Sariputta uses this famous analogy to explain the interdependency of consciousness and name-form:\n\nAs described above in the discussion of mental fabrications' conditioning of consciousness, past intentional actions establish a kammic seed within consciousness that expresses itself in the future. Through consciousness's \"life force\" aspect, these future expressions are not only within a single lifespan but propel kammic impulses (\"kammavega\") across samsaric rebirths.\n\nIn the \"Serene Faith Discourse\" (\"Sampasadaniya Sutta\", DN 28), Ven. Sariputta references not a singular conscious entity but a \"stream of consciousness\" (\"viññāa-sota\") that spans multiple lives:\n\nThe \"Great Causes Discourse\" (\"Mahanidana Sutta\", DN 15), in a dialogue between the Buddha and the Ven. Ananda, describes \"consciousness\" (\"viññāa\") in a way that underlines its \"life force\" aspect:\n\nDiscourses such as this to describe a consciousness that is an animating phenomenon capable of spanning lives thus giving rise to rebirth.\n\nAn Anguttara Nikaya discourse provides a memorable metaphor to describe the interplay of kamma, consciousness, craving and rebirth:\n\nThe Patthana, part of the Theravadin Abhidharma, analyzes the different states of consciousness and their functions. The Theravāda school method is to study every state of consciousness. Using this method, some states of consciousness are identified as positive, some negative and some neutral. This analysis is based on the principle of karma, the main point in understanding the different consciousnesses. Altogether, according to the Abhidhamma, there are 89 kinds of consciousness. Fifty-four are of the \"sense sphere\" (related to the five physical senses as well as craving for sensual pleasure), 15 of the \"fine-material sphere\" (related to the meditative absorptions based on material objects), 12 of the \"immaterial sphere\" (related to the immaterial meditative absorptions), and eight are supramundane (related to the realization of Nibbāna).\n\nMore specifically, a \"viññāa\" is a single moment of conceptual consciousness and normal mental activity is considered to consist of a continual succession of \"viññāa\"s.\n\n\"Viññāa\" has two components: the awareness itself, and the object of that awareness (which might be a perception, a feeling etc.). Thus, in this way, these \"viññāa\"s are not considered as ultimate (underived) phenomena as they are based on mental factors (\"cetasika\"). For example, jhānic (meditative) states are described as based on the five ultimate mental factors of applied thought (\"vitakka\"), sustained thought (\"vicara\"), rapture (\"piti\"), serenity (\"sukha\") and one-pointedness (\"ekaggatā\").\n\nAccording to Bhikkhu Bodhi, the post-canonical Pali commentary uses the three terms \"viññāa\", \"mano\" and \"citta\" as synonyms for the mind sense base (\"mana-ayatana\"); however, in the Sutta Pitaka, these three terms are generally contextualized differently:\n\nThe citta is called \"luminous\" in A.I.8-10.\n\nWhile most Buddhist schools identify six modes of consciousness, one for each sense base, some Buddhist schools have identified additional modes.\n\nAs described above, in reference to the \"All\" (\"sabba\"), the Sutta Pitaka identifies six vijñānas related to the six sense bases: \n\nThe Yogacara / Cittamatra school consider two more consciousnesses. \n\nAccording to Walpola Rahula, the \"store consciousness\" of Yogacara thought exists in the early texts as well, as the \"citta.\"\n\nThe (), \"immaculate consciousness\", is considered by some Yogācāra schools as a ninth level of consciousness. This \"pure consciousness is identified with the nature of reality (parinispanna) or Suchness.\" Alternatively, amalavijñāna may be considered the pure aspect of ālāyavijñāna.\n\nSome buddhists also suggest hrdaya (Heart) consciousnesses (一切一心識), or an eleven consciousnesses theory or an infinity consciousness ().\n\n\"Viññāna\" is used in Thai Buddhism to refer specifically to one's consciousness or life-force after it has left the body at the moment of death. Thais differentiate between winyaan and \"jid-jai\" (จิตใจ), which is the consciousness while it is still connected to a living body. Even though the jid-jai leaves the body while you dream at night and can also externalize during advanced meditation practice, it is still connected to the body.\n\nSri Ramakrishna defines \"vijñāna\" as\n\nAyon Maharaj has characterized Sri Ramakrishna's views as manifesting what he called a \"philosophy of Vijñāna Vedānta\". In his book \"Infinite Paths to Infinite Reality\" (2018), Maharaj describes six major tenets of Ramakrishna's Vijñāna Vedānta. These include the notion that \"the \"vijñānī\" returns from the state of \"nirvikalpa samādhi\" and attains the richer, world-affirming nondual realization that God has become everything.\"\n\nBased on ancient texts, V.S.Apte (1890, rev. 1957-59) provides the following definition for \"vijñānam\" (विज्ञानम्):\n\nIn addition, Monier Williams (1899; rev. 2008) provides the following definition:\n\n\n\n"}

Miller, along with his friend Luke Williams, was brought to America in 1965 by fellow New Zealander Steve Rickard, who was also the booker for NWA Hawaii. Luke and Butch initially worked in Canada among others for Stu Hart’s Stampede Wrestling billed as \"The Kiwis\" (Butch was known as \"Nick Carter\" and Luke was known as \"Sweet William\"). The first recorded title that the Kiwis won was in 1974 when the duo beat Bob Pringle and Bill Cody for the Stampede International Tag Team Championship on 6 January 1974. The Kiwis lost the titles to Tokyo Joe and the Great Saki only to regain them a short time later. The Kiwis lost the titles for good when Stan Kowalski and Duke Savage defeated them and kept the titles away from them in subsequent rematches.\n\nAfter leaving Stampede Wrestling, the Kiwis began doing double duty in NWA Pacific Northwest as well as the Canadian-based International All-Star Wrestling around 1979–1980 as \"the Kiwi Sheepherders\". In 1979, the team won the NWA Pacific Northwest Tag Team Championship on three occasions between 21 July and 5 August 1980 before they left the territory. On 22 September, the Sheepherders lost the gold to Dutch Savage and Stan Stasiak only to regain them a week later. On 11 February 1980, the Sheepherders became double champions when they downed Dutch Savage and Stasiak once again, this time for the NWA Canadian Tag Team Championship. Top faces Rick Martel and \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper teamed up in May 1980 to take the NWA Canadian tag titles from the Sheepherders and, in effect, run the duo out of the Northwest region by August, gaining the NWA Pacific Northwest tag titles when the Sheepherders left the promotion.\n\nThe next stop for the Sheepherders was a brief stay in the Mid Atlantic Championship Wrestling territory run by Jim Crockett. In MACW, the two won the NWA Mid-Atlantic Tag Team Championship by beating Matt Borne and Buzz Sawyer for the gold. The Sheepherders held onto the gold for close to three months before dropping it to Dewey Robertson and George Wells on 12 December. After losing the titles, Luke and Butch headed for warmer weather as they traveled to Puerto Rico and began working for the World Wrestling Council as \"Los Pastores\". While in Puerto Rico, the team would win the WWC North American Tag Team Championship twice while touring the island.\n\nAfter the team left WWC, Butch decided that he wanted to return closer to home and went to Australia to wrestle. Luke remained in the United States determined to keep the \"Sheepherders\" name on everyone's lips by teaming up with \"Lord\" Jonathan Boyd (formerly of the Royal Kangaroos). In 1983, Boyd and Williams were working for Southwest Championship Wrestling when in June, Jonathan Boyd legitimately broke his leg in a car accident. While Boyd was out with the broken leg Butch returned from Australia to reunite with his old tag-team partner.\n\nLuke and Butch stayed with the SWCW through the rest of 1983 and into 1984, when the two came head to head with the Fabulous Ones, a team Williams and Boyd had feuded with extensively while Miller was away. This time the prize was the SWCW World Tag Team Championship. The Fabulous Ones had supposedly won the titles in Australia, which is generally believed to be a fictitious tournament invented by the SWCW. The Sheepherders defeated the Fabs on 4 March and held the titles until the SWCW abandoned the tag team titles in September 1984. The next major stop for the Sheepherders was a return to Puerto Rico and the WWC, this time competing as \"The Sheepherders\" instead of \"Los Pastores.\" On 6 January 1985 the team defeated The Invaders (Invader I and Invader III) for the WWC North American Tag Team Championship in Bayamon, Puerto Rico. Butch and Luke lost and then regained the titles from Invaders I and III in March and then held on to the gold until August, when the Invaders won the tag team title back for good.\n\nWhen Luke and Butch returned to main land USA and signed on with Bill Watts’ UWF, they quickly cemented their status by beating Ted DiBiase and Steve Williams for the UWF Tag Team Championship on 16 March 1986. The Sheepherders worked for Bill Watts on and off over the next couple of years, taking time out to participate in the first ever Jim Crockett Memorial Tag Team Cup where they made it to the third round. In the third round the Sheepherders clashed with the Fantastics in an out of control brawl that ended in a double disqualification. The winners of this match would have gone on to face eventual tournament winners The Road Warriors in the next round. Back in the UWF for their \"Mid South Superdome Show\", the Sheepherders clashed with the Fantastics once more, this time Luke and Butch lost in a \"New Zealand Boot camp\" match to the UWF Tag champs.\n\nAfter being unable to beat the Fantastics on several occasions, the Sheepherders traveled back to Puerto Rico during the summer for a six-week run with the WWC World Tag Team Championship on 3 August. When their short run with WWC ended, Luke and Butch sought new challenges and traveled to Florida where they worked for Championship Wrestling from Florida. While there, the Sheepherders came across their old rivals the Fabulous Ones, instantly rekindling their violent feud. This feud saw Luke and Butch end the Fabulous Ones’ first reign with the NWA Florida United States Tag Team Championship and would keep them away from the Fabulous Ones until Lane and Keirn finally got the better of them on 30 November, when they regained the belts.\n\nIn 1987, the Sheepherders returned to the CWA once more. On 10 January, the New Zealanders beat the up-and-coming team of Badd Company (Pat Tanaka and Paul Diamond) for the CWA/AWA International Tag Team Championship but lost them back to Badd Company as fast as they had won them. After the quick run with Badd Company, the Sheepherders once again became entangled in a feud with the Fabulous Ones in a rivalry that seemingly would never end. In what turned out to the last series of matches between the Sheepherders and the Fabulous Ones, the Fabulous Ones dominated the matches and once again \"ran off\" the Sheepherders.\n\nAfter leaving Memphis the Sheepherders returned to Puerto Rico and the WWC. Here the Sheepherders started a bloody feud with Chris and Mark Youngblood that drew big crowds in Puerto Rico. The feud saw Luke and Butch win the WWC World Tag Team titles on 4 April and then defend them tooth and nail until the Youngbloods regained the gold on 10 May in a cage match. After their spring run with WWC the Sheepherders returned to Florida and instantly became challengers for Mike Graham and Steve Keirn's NWA Florida Tag Team Championship. On 26 June, Luke and Butch added that title to their collection by brawling and cheating. Their run with the Florida titles came to an end on 29 August when Keirn and Graham regained the titles.\n\nAfter losing the Florida titles, Luke and Butch returned to the UWF and started a second run with the UWF World Tag Team Championship after beating Brad Armstrong and Tim Horner on 16 October. The Sheepherders held the UWF tag team titles until the UWF was bought out by Jim Crockett and merged into Jim Crockett Promotions to form the forerunner of World Championship Wrestling. When the UWF merged Luke and Butch began working for JCP, participating in the third Jim Crockett, Sr. Memorial, Tag Team Tournament Cup losing to The Midnight Express (Bobby Eaton and Stan Lane) in the second round. At \"Clash of the Champions II\" the Sheepherders faced off against the NWA United States Tag Team Champions Fantastics, but did not win the gold. At \"Clash of the Champions III\" the Sheepherders lost to Steve Williams and Nikita Koloff despite the interference of Rip Morgan. Just as it looked like the Sheepherders were going to face the Fantastics in the finals of a tournament to crown new United States tag team champions, Luke and Butch signed with Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Federation.\n\nLuke and Butch signed on with the WWF in the midst of its national expansion, giving them a national and international exposure unlike anything they had ever had before. The team changed their name to The Bushwhackers and changed their violent style to a comedic style which was an instant hit with the fans. The comedy act involved licking, arm motions and more. The Bushwhackers made their debut on 3 January 1989 on a WWF Superstars of Wrestling taping.\n\nThroughout the Bushwhackers' run in the WWF, the team was a solid mid-card team, feuding against such teams as The Fabulous Rougeau Brothers, Rhythm and Blues (The Honky Tonk Man and Greg Valentine), The Natural Disasters, The Beverly Brothers and The Headshrinkers. Several of the feuds were comedy-oriented, with the Bushwhackers' antagonists expressing disdain for their wild and wacky ways. In addition, Butch (along with Luke) participated in a long-running series of comedy vignettes, with \"Mean\" Gene Okerlund their usual foil; these vignettes were often featured on Coliseum Home Video releases where they served as the \"link\" between matches.\n\nThe Bushwhackers remained in the WWF through 1996, by which time they were a lower-card team and frequently used to job to newer teams such as The Blu Brothers and The Bodydonnas. Late in the Bushwhackers' run, the team was accompanied to the ring by a giant kangaroo mascot.\n\nAfter leaving the WWF, the team made special appearances in the independent circuit, including a return to WWC for its 24th Anniversary show where they were billed as the Sheepherders and took on old rivals Invaders I & II. They also appeared at a special event in Amarillo to celebrate \"50 years of Funk\" where they lost to Mark and Chris Youngblood.\n\nIn 1999, the Bushwhackers participated in a \"wrestling nostalgia\" pay-per-view called Heroes of Wrestling. Luke and Butch defeated former WWF Tag Team Champions The Iron Sheik and Nikolai Volkoff. Luke and Butch made one of their last appearances as active wrestlers on 1 April 2001 when they participated in the \"Gimmick Battle Royal\" at WrestleMania X7. On 15 June, the team returned to Memphis one last time, fighting The Moondogs to a double disqualification on a special \"Mid-South Clash of the Legends\" show.\n\nIn September 2001, Miller was rushed to the hospital after suffering a neck injury. While in the hospital, he also had a brush with sepsis, but he survived. Miller retired after the incident and moved back to New Zealand where he began working as the commissioner for NZWPW and also writes a column for \"NZPWI.CO.NZ\". He currently lives in Paraparaumu Beach and is the Commissioner for Kiwi Pro Wrestling.\n\nWhen the WWE came to New Zealand on 11 June 2008 in Auckland he was a guest on the first international \"V.I.P Lounge\" along with Tony Garea. The segment's host, Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) announced him as Bushwhacker Luke but then apologized. Eventually, MVP attacked Butch and Garea with the microphone. Butch and Garea recovered and fought off MVP, then celebrated with the Bushwhacker walk.\n\nIn 2015, The Bushwhackers were inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by John Laurinaitis.\n\nIn February 2018, the Bushwhackers reunited for one last tour of their native New Zealand.\n\nMiller moved back to New Zealand from Florida in 2003. He lived in Paraparamu Beach until 2016. He was ever present at the Robert Harris café and City Fitness gym in Coastlands. He met his wife Helen in a Paraparaumu gym and the romance blossomed. His wife Helen used to work in the shoe shop in Coastlands. Miller and his wife Helen moved to Ōtaki Beach in 2016 because of the sand.\n\nThe Bushwhackers appeared as themselves in a of the sitcom \"Family Matters\", wrestling against Carl Winslow and Steve Urkel, who are forced to fill in for and wrestle as \"The Psycho Twins.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1983390", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1983390", "title": "Gaykhatu", "text": "Gaykhatu\n\nGaykhatu (Mongolian script:; ) was the fifth Ilkhanate ruler in Iran. He reigned from 1291 to 1295. His Buddhist baghshi gave him the Tibetan name Rinchindorj () which was appeared on his paper money.\n\nHe was born to Abaqa and Nukdan Khatun, a Tatar lady in c.1259. He was living in Jazira during Tekuder's reign and had to flee to Arghun in Khorasan after Qonqurtai's execution in 1284. He was given as hostage to Tekuder by Arghun as a condition of truce in June 1284 and put in orda of Todai Khatun, his step-mother. After Arghun's enthroment, he was confirmed as governor of Anatolia together with his uncle Hulachu.\n\nHe was stationed in Erzinjan and learnt to speak Persian and to some degree Turkish during his stay in Anatolia. Gaykhatu ruled Anatolia solely after recall of Hulachu to Iran in 1286. It was then he was married to Padishah Khatun, a princess of Qutlugh-Khanids. He aided Masud II on his campaigns against Turkmen principalities, most importantly Germiyanids. Using opportunity, Karamanids invaded Mongol allies of Cilician Armenia during his campaign. Gaykhatu was sent in turn by Arghun to help Leo II against Güneri of Karaman in 1286, who had captured Tarsus from Cilician Kingdom. Gaykhatu invaded and burned his capital Karaman on 16 January 1287, forcing Güneri to retreat to mountains.Gaykhatu's viceroyalty was briefly interrupted by appointment of Samagar from 1289 to 1290. He resumed his activities when Samagar was arrested on 15 October 1290 in Tokat on charges of corruption and was sent back to Iran. Gaykhatu visited Konya on 3 January 1291, confirming appointment of his new tax officer Khwaja Nasir ud-Din and conduction of a new general census.\nHe heard of Arghun's death in his wintering pastures near Antalya from Lagzi Küregen (son of Arghun Aqa and in-law of Hulagu Khan). Main contenders for the throne were his nephew Ghazan and cousin Baydu. He was nominated for the throne by an influential Mongol commander, Ta'achar. Ta'achar intended to promote Baydu therefore sent envoys to Gaykhatu, lying him that Baydu was already taken the throne. Suspicious Gaykhatu tortured envoy to learn truth and sent 10.000 men ahead upon learning it, while himself moved to Arran and Azerbaijan. He was accompanied by Masud II and Mujir ad-Din Emirshah till Aladagh in Van. While nobles like Taghachar, Qoncuqbal, Toghan and Tuqal supported Baydu, he refused throne stating throne belongs to the brother or a son according to yassa, while Mahmud Aqsarai simply states that when Baydu didn't appear at the \"quriltai\", Gaykhatu was enthroned instead. His other contender Ghazan was dealing with rebellion of Nawrūz (another son of Arghun Aqa), therefore couldn't attend the qurultai himself, thus losing a bid to throne. As a consequence, Gaykhatu was elected il-khan at qurultai on 23 July 1291, Ahlat. Gaikhatu's main supporter was his new wife Uruk Khatun - widow of Arghun and mother of Öljaitü.\n\nHis first orders upon taking throne was to punish several emirs including Taghachar and Tuqal. Taghachar's (or in some sources, Qoncuqbal's) 10.000 army was given to Shiktur Noyan of Jalairs, while Tuqal's army was given to an amir named Narin Ahmad. Another Baydu supporter, Toghan was arrested on his way to escape to Khorasan. Meanwhile a rebellion by Turkmen emirs started in Anatolia, Gaykhatu had to move into his former domains, appointing Shiktur Noyan as regent of the state while confirming Anbarchi (son of Möngke Temür) as viceroy of East stationed in Ray.\n\nHazaraspid ruler Afrasiab I took opportunity to extend his rule to Isfahan upon hearing Arghun's death in 1291. Gaykhatu's retribution was brutal, sending commander of his personal \"keshig\" Tuladai to pillage Lorestan who obtained Afrasiab's submission. Gaykhatu's wives Padshah and Uruk interceded on behalf of Afrasiab, asking for forgiveness. As a consequence, while Afrasiab was reinstated as ruler of Lorestan, his brother Ahmad was held at Ilkhanid court as hostage. \n\nGaykhatu left for Anatolia in pursuit of Karamanids who were besieging Konya on 31 August 1291 with 20.000 men. Despite Konya was enforced by a brother of Masud II and Sahib Ataids, Karamanids didn't leave until Gaykhatu's arrival at Kayseri. Gaykhatu divided his army into two, sending a part to Menteshe, while he himself raided first Karamanid capital Ereğli. His next target was Eshrefid beylik to the west, from whom he captured 7000 women and children, sending to Konya. After returning to Kayseri, he sent Goktai and Girai noyans to punish former supporters of Kilij Arslan IV on northern Anatolia accompanied by Seljuk armies. Using opportunity, Karamanids and Eshrefids again besieged Konya, but had to withraw their armies when Henry II of Cyprus besieged Alaiye with 15 ships. Gaykhatu on the other hand captured Denizli and looted the city for 3 days. Masud also went on to fight against Kilij Arslan who was supported by Masud's brothers Faramurz and Kayumars in addition to Chobanids. Gaykhatu sent him an additional 3000 men with commanders Goktai, Girai and Anit. It was Girai and Temür Yaman Jandar who rescued Masud II from Turkmen captivity. Temür Yaman Jandar was granted former Chobanid city of Kastamonu by Gaykhatu as an iqta due to this service.\nGaykhatu spent 11 months in Anatolian campaign and went back to Iran in May/June 1292. His absence in Iran was followed by a conspiracy led by Taghachar and his follower Sad al-Din Zanjani. They falsely informed viceroy Anbarchi - via Sad al-Din's brother Qutb al-Din, who was Anbarchi's vizier - of Gaykhatu's defeat by Turkmens in Anatolia and called him to take the throne. While ambitious, Anbarchi regarded this news with suspicion. After contacting Shiktur Noyan who was residing near Karachal, Anbarchi had them imprisoned by Shiktur. Gaykhatu arrived at Aladagh on 29 June 1292, had second enthroment, possibly receiving a confirmation by Kublai Khagan.\n\nUpon returning, Gaykhatu allowed his wife Padishah Khatun's gaining Kirman in October 1292; pardoned both Taghachar and Sad al-Din Zanjani, even appointing the latter to the post of vizier on 18 November 1292 while confirming his father-in-law Aq Buqa Jalair as commander-in-chief. Shiktur and Taghachar were subordinated to him. Sad al-Din also managed to get his brother Qutb al-Din to be appointed as governor of Tabriz. Amassing huge amount of power and wealth in his hand, Sad al-Din became real ruler of the Ilkhanate with personal army of 10.000, while gaining certain enemies as well. Former emirs Hasan and Taiju attempted to accuse him of embezzlement of state funds unsuccessfully. \n\nIn 1292, Gaykhatu had sent a message to the Egyptian Mamluk Sultan Al-Ashraf Khalil, threatening to conquer the whole of the Levant if he doesn't return Aleppo. Al-Ashraf replied: \"\"The khan has the same ideas as me. I too hope to bring back Baghdad to the fold of Islam as previously. We will see which of us two will be quicker\"\". However, there were no major battles between Mongols and Mamlukes afterwards.\n\nDuring his reign, the princess Kökötchin had arrived from the court of his Khagan Kublai in 1293, escorted by none other than Marco Polo. The new Ilkhan decreed that the princess be married to his nephew Ghazan, who had fully supported his right to rule. Ghazan on the other hand sent a tiger to Gaykhatu as an answer. Marco Polo and his entourage stayed with Gaykhatu with 9 months.\n\nGolden Horde khan Toqta who ascended the throne at same time as Gaykhatu sent Prince Qalintay and Pulad as envoys to Ilkhanate on 28 March 1294 to make truce and possibly ask for help against Toqta's rivals. They were returned to Golden Horde 3 days later.\n\nIn 1294, Gaykhatu wanted to replenish his treasury emptied by a great cattle plague. In response, his vizier Sad al-Din Zanjani proposed the introduction of a recent Chinese invention called \"Jiaochao\" (paper money). Gaykhatu agreed and called for Kublai Khan's ambassador Bolad in Tabriz. After the ambassador showed how the system worked, Gaykhatu printed banknotes which imitated the Chinese ones so closely that they even had Chinese words printed on them. The Muslim confession of faith was printed on the banknotes to placate local sentiment. Gaykhatu's Buddhist name Rinchindorj was also present on money. Shiktur Noyan objected to introduction, calling this a foul attempt. First circulation started on 12 September 1294 in Tabriz. Gaykhatu ordered anyone who is going to refuse to use money to be executed on the spot. Poets, including Wassaf started to praise chao in order to appease Gaykhatu.Paper moneys circulated were worth from half dirham to 10 dinars.\n\nThe plan was to get his subjects to use only paper money, and allow Gaykhatu to control the treasury. The experiment was a complete failure, as the people and merchants refused to accept the banknotes. Soon, bazaar riots broke out, economic activities came to a standstill, and the Persian historian Rashid ud-din speaks even of \"'the ruin of Basra' which ensued upon the emission of the new money\". Gaykhatu had no choice but to withdraw the use of paper money.\nGaykhatu insulted Baydu telling one of his servants to hit Baydu while being drunk. This grew a resentment in Baydu towards him. Baydu left hastily towards to his appanage near Baghdad leaving his son Qipchak as a hostage in Gaykhatu's court. He was supported by Oirat emir Chichak (son of Sulaimish b. Tengiz Güregen), Lagzi Küregen (son of Arghun Aqa), El-Temur (son of Hinduqur Noyan) and Todachu Yarquchi, who followed him to Baghdad. He was also aided by his vizier Jamal ud-Din Dastgerdani. According to Hamdullah Qazwini, Baydu's main motivation on moving against Gaykhatu was his sexual advances against Qipchak. When son-in-law Ghurbatai Güregen brought him news of treachery, Gaykhatu ordered arrest of several amirs including his personal \"keshig\" Tuladai, Qoncuqbal, Tukal, Bughdai, including Kipchak and put into jail in Tabriz. While his followers Hasan and Taiju demanded their executions, Taghachar advised against it. Baydu on his side, moved to kill Muhammad Sugurchi, governor of Baghdad and arrested governor Baybuqa of Diyar Bakr. Gaykhatu sent his father-in-law Aq Buqa and Taghachar against Baydu on 17 March 1295, himself arriving at Tabriz 4 days later. Little he knew that Taghachar already shifted allegiance to Baydu who left for his encampment at night. While he wanted to flee to Anatolia, his councillors advised to fight against Baydu. Nevertheless, Gaykhatu fled to Mughan. Arriving in Tabriz, Taghachar set Qoncuqbal and Tuladai free, while Gaikhatu desperately begged for mercy. Despite his appeal, he was strangled by a bowstring so as to avoid bloodshed on 21 March 1295. However, some sources put this event on 5 March or 25 April. An alternative story of Gaykhatu's death claims Baydu made war on him because of his introduction of paper money and subsequently killed him in battle.\n\nGaykhatu was a noted dissolute who was addicted to wine, women, and sodomy, not necessarily in that order, according to Mirkhond. But he was also known for his secularism and communal harmony. Like other Buddhist kings, he used to liberally give patronage to all religions Among his beneficiaries were the Nestorian Christians, who praise him abundantly for his gifts to the Church, as apparent in the history of Mar Yahballaha III.He was described a just and charitable ruler in Tārikh-i Āl-i Saldjūq.\n\nGaykhatu had eight consorts from different clans:\n\n\n"}

He was a fast-paced player who usually played as a winger, and occasionally as a striker. Groves also played for Colchester United and Southampton. He currently works as a media pundit.\n\nGroves was born in Bow, London, but as a boy he played for Cornard Dynamos in the village of Great Cornard on the Suffolk - Essex border. Groves then had a trial with Wolves as a schoolboy before signing as an apprentice for Colchester United in 1981. He turned professional a year later and over the next four seasons he played 142 league games for the U's, scoring 26 goals.\n\nIn September 1986, he signed for Arsenal for £50,000, becoming the first signing by new manager George Graham. In his first season at the club he helped set up Charlie Nicholas for the winner in the 1987 League Cup final, dribbling past three Liverpool players before laying the ball off.\n\nNoted for his enthusiasm and hard work, he started most of Arsenal's games in the 1987–88 season, ousting Charlie Nicholas as strike partner to Alan Smith, and helping the Gunners reach a second League Cup final the following season by scoring the only goal of the away leg of the semi-final against Everton; Arsenal however lost the final to Luton Town. Although Groves made 46 appearances in all competitions that season, the arrival of Brian Marwood reduced his opportunities to play, and he was mainly used as a substitute in Arsenal's title-winning 1988–89 season, coming off the bench 15 times during the league campaign, on top of 6 starts. He was on the pitch as a substitute in the final game of the season and helped create the space when Michael Thomas famously scored the title clinching goal at Anfield.\n\nAlthough an injury to Marwood opened the door for him again in 1989–90, Groves returned to the bench after Marwood recovered. This did not however stop him from winning a second league title winners' medal in 1990–91, again with most of his appearances coming as a sub, as Graham usually favoured Kevin Campbell to play alongside Alan Smith. After making only 13 league appearances in 1991–92 Groves was sold to Southampton.\n\nHe moved to Southampton in 1992 for £750,000 but only played 15 times in two years before retiring from professional football at the age of 28, following two serious Achilles tendon injuries.\n\nHe then played four games in the Conference for Dagenham & Redbridge before ending his playing career with a solitary appearance for Canvey Island.\n\nGroves has appeared for Arsenal in several Masters footballing tournaments.\nHe is now a well established sports pundit and has worked for a wide variety of media firms including Sky Sports, BBC Radio 5 Live, BT Sport, Absolute Radio as well as TalkSPORT. Groves was previously part of Absolute Radio's Sony Award winning Rock 'N' Roll Football show, fronted by former Arsenal teammate, Ian Wright, which airs on a Saturday.\n\nIn 2010, Groves signed as a non-playing substitute for new club Chester after Colin Murray, then of BBC Radio 5 Live, offered the new club £2,000 if they named Groves and Pat Nevin as unused substitutes at every game in the 2010–11 season.\n\nIn March 2014, along with his friend Josh Landy, Groves launched a company called \"Play With A Legend\" which offers football fans the chance to play alongside their heroes such as Matt Le Tissier, Paul Merson and Dion Dublin on stag, corporate and charity events. The concept has been well received and has achieved national publicity.\n\nGroves became a cult player among Arsenal fans, who commemorate him with the chant \"We all live in a Perry Groves World\", which listed Perry in every position from 1 to 12 (except 7, which is instead taken by Liam Brady), to the tune of The Beatles' \"Yellow Submarine\".\n\nHe still has a large following, with a fan club and website devoted to him.\nIn October 2006, Groves published his autobiography, entitled \"We All Live in a Perry Groves World\" (). With it came an Arsenal fans' campaign on the web to purchase the book, in an attempt to outsell former Arsenal defender Ashley Cole's autobiography, \"My Defence\", which was out at the same time. His autobiography has since outsold that of Cole.\n\nHis uncle Vic Groves, having previously featuring for Tottenham Hotspur, played for and captained Arsenal. He playing as a forward making 203 appearances while scoring 37 goals.\n\n\n"}

After working Australasia and the Eastern Circuit (Singapore, Malaysia, and Japan), the duo was booked in North America in \"Grand Prix\" (Quebec, The Maritimes, Ontario, and Vermont), a very successful promotion owned by the famous Vachons and Edouard Carpentier, in 1972 by fellow New Zealander Steve Rickard, who was also the booker for \"NWA Hawaii\". Luke and Butch worked in Canada for Stu Hart's Stampede Wrestling billed as The Kiwis (Butch was known as \"Nick Carter\" and Luke was known as \"Sweet William\"). The first recorded title that the Kiwis won was in 1974, when the duo beat Bob Pringle and Bill Cody for the Stampede International Tag Team Championship on 6 January 1974. The Kiwis lost the titles to Tokyo Joe and the Great Saki, only to regain them a short time later. The Kiwis lost the titles for good when Stan Kowalski and Dutch Savage defeated them and kept the titles away from them in subsequent rematches. In 1973, they were on the infamous Jarry Park show in Montreal that drew a record attendance of 29,673.\n\nAfter leaving Stampede Wrestling, the Kiwis began doing double duty in NWA Pacific Northwest as well as the Canadian-based International All-Star Wrestling around 1979-1980 as \"the Kiwi Sheepherders\". In 1979, the team won the NWA Pacific Northwest Tag Team Championship on three occasions between 21 July and 5 August 1980, before they left the territory. On 22 September, the Sheepherders lost the gold to Dutch Savage and Stan Stasiak, only to regain them a week later. On 11 February 1980, the Sheepherders became double champions when they downed Dutch Savage and Stan Stasiak, this time for the NWA Canadian Tag Team Championship. Top faces Rick Martel and \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper teamed up in May, to take the NWA Canadian tag title from the Sheepherders and, in effect, run the duo out of the Northwest region by August, gaining the NWA Pacific Northwest tag titles when the Sheepherders left the promotion.\n\nThe next stop for the Sheepherders was a brief stay in the Mid Atlantic Championship Wrestling territory run by Jim Crockett. In MACW, the two won the NWA Mid-Atlantic Tag Team Championship by beating Matt Borne and Buzz Sawyer for the gold. The Sheepherders held onto the gold for close to three months before dropping it to Dewey Robertson and Rocky Johnson on 12 December. After losing the titles, Luke and Butch headed for warmer weather as they traveled to Puerto Rico and began working for the World Wrestling Council as Los Pastores. While in Puerto Rico, the team won the WWC North American Tag Team Championship twice while touring the island.\n\nAfter the team left WWC, Butch decided that he wanted to return closer to home and went to Australia to wrestle. Luke remained in the United States determined to keep the \"Sheepherders\" name on everyone's lips by teaming up with \"Lord\" Jonathan Boyd (formerly of the Royal Kangaroos). The duo of Williams and Boyd quickly gained a reputation of one of the most violent, hard hitting teams in the business. One of the first people to feel the wrath of the \"new and improved\" Sheepherders was Robert Fuller in South Eastern Championship Wrestling. In December 1981, the Sheepherders won the NWA Southeast Tag Team Championship that had been vacated when Robert Fuller and Jos LeDuc split. After winning the title, Boyd and Williams became embroiled in a bitter feud with Robert Fuller and various partners including his brother Ron Fuller and his cousin Jimmy Golden (later known as Bunkhouse Buck). One act that made the Sheepherders the most hated men in SECW for a while was when the duo kayfabe attacked and injured Jimmy's father Billy Golden. After almost 10 months with the title, the Sheepherders were finally defeated by Fuller and Golden; this ended the feud on a high note for the face duo, as the Sheepherders were \"run out\" of the territory.\n\nBoyd and Williams moved slightly more north as they began to work in the Memphis based promotion Continental Wrestling Association owned and operated by Jerry Jarrett and Jerry Lawler. In the CWA, the Sheepherders would start a feud that stood as their most memorable, bloody, and brutal as the team kicked off a long running feud with The Fabulous Ones (Stan Lane and Steve Keirn). The \"pretty boy\", well polished Fabulous Ones and the ugly, brawling savage Sheepherders were the perfect opponents and repeatedly drew big gates all over the country. The matches started out pretty evenly, but soon turned brutal and often without a definite winner. In late 1982, the Sheepherders won the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship from Lane and Keirn, which only turned the intensity of the matches up a notch. Between late December and mid-February, the two teams traded the belts back and forth 4 times with the Fabulous Ones ending up with possession of them in the end. On 28 March, the Sheepherders wrestled their last match in the Mid-South Coliseum before leaving the CWA.\n\nBoyd and Williams resurfaced in Southwest Championship Wrestling only weeks later, continuing their brutal and destructive ways. Their first target was the reigning Southwest Tag Team Champions \"The Grapplers\" (Len Denton and Tony Anthony). In May, the Sheepherders won the gold from the duo through nefarious means; before the match Williams and Boyd had bribed the Grapplers' manager Don Carson and promised he would become a tag team champion, Carson turned on the Grapplers mid match to ensure the Sheepherders' victory. The Sheepherders run with the gold was short lived; Jonathan Boyd legitimately broke his leg in a car accident in June which forced the SWCW to name Bobby Jaggers as a replacement. After Williams and Jagger lost a non-title match to Bob Sweetan and Sweet Brown Sugar, Williams turned on Jaggers and the titles were vacated. While Boyd was out with the broken leg, Williams was reunited with his old tag-team partner, Butch straight from Australia.\n\nLuke and Butch stayed with the SWCW through the rest of 1983 and into 1984. There, the two again came head to head with the Fabulous Ones; this time the prize was the SWCW World Tag Team Championship. The Fabulous Ones had supposedly won the titles in Australia, which is generally believed to be a fictitious tournament invented by the SWCW. The Sheepherders defeated the Fabs on 4 March and held the titles until the SWCW abandoned the tag team titles in September 1984. The next major stop for the Sheepherders was a return to Puerto Rico and the WWC, this time competing as \"The Sheepherders\" instead of \"Los Pastores\". On 6 January 1985, the team defeated Invader I and Invader III for the WWC North American Tag Team Championship in Bayamón, Puerto Rico. Butch and Luke lost and then regained the titles from Invaders I & III in March and held on to the gold until August when the Invaders won the tag team title back for good.\n\nWhen Luke and Butch returned to main land USA and signed on with Bill Watts’ UWF, they quickly cemented their status by beating Ted DiBiase and Steve Williams for the UWF Tag Team Championship on 16 March 1986. The Sheepherders worked for Bill Watts on and off over the next couple of years, taking time out to participate in the first ever Jim Crockett Memorial Tag Team Cup where they made it to the third round. In the third round, the Sheepherders clashed with the Fantastics in an out of control brawl that ended in a double DQ. The winners of this match would have gone on to face eventual tournament winners The Road Warriors in the next round. Back in the UWF for their big \"Mid South Superdome Show\", the Sheepherders clashed with the Fantastics once more. This time, Luke and Butch lost in a \"New Zealand Boot camp\" match to the UWF Tag champs.\n\nAfter being unable to beat the Fantastics on several occasions, the Sheepherders traveled back to Puerto Rico during the summer for a six-week run with the WWC World Tag Team Championship on 3 August. When their short run with WWC ended, Luke and Butch sought new challenges and traveled to Florida where they worked for Championship Wrestling from Florida. In Florida the Sheepherders came across their old arch enemies the Fabulous Ones, instantly rekindling their violent feud. This feud saw Luke and Butch end the Fabulous Ones' first reign with the NWA Florida United States Tag Team Championship; they kept the titles away from the Fabs until Lane and Keirn finally got the better of them on 30 November.\n\nIn 1987, the Sheepherders returned to the CWA once more. On 10 January, the New Zealanders beat the up-and-coming team of Badd Company (Pat Tanaka and Paul Diamond) for the CWA/AWA International Tag Team Championship. Unfortunately, they lost them back to Badd Company as fast as they had won them. After the quick run with Badd Company, the Sheepherders again became entangled in a feud with the Fabulous Ones in a rivalry that seemingly would never end. In what turned out to the last series of matches between the Sheepherders and the Fabulous Ones, the Fabs dominated the matches and again \"ran off\" the Sheepherders.\n\nAfter leaving Memphis, the Sheepherders returned to Puerto Rico and the WWC. Here the Sheepherders started a bloody feud with Chris and Mark Youngblood that drew big crowds in Puerto Rico. The feud saw Luke and Butch win the WWC World Tag Team titles on 4 April and then defend them tooth and nail until the Youngbloods regained the gold on 10 May in a cage match. After their spring run with WWC, the Sheepherders returned to Florida and instantly became challengers for Mike Graham and Steve Keirn's NWA Florida Tag Team Championship. On 26 June, Luke and Butch added that title to their collection by brawling and cheating. Their run with the Florida titles came to an end on 29 August when Keirn and Graham regained the titles.\n\nAfter losing the Florida titles, Luke and Butch returned to the UWF and started a second run with the UWF World Tag Team Championship after beating Brad Armstrong and Tim Horner on 16 October. The Sheepherders held the UWF tag team titles until the UWF was bought out by Jim Crockett and merged into Jim Crockett Promotions to form the forerunner of WCW. When the UWF merged Luke and Butch began working for JCP, participating in the third Jim Crockett, Sr. Memorial, Tag Team Tournament Cup losing to The Midnight Express (Bobby Eaton and Stan Lane) in the second round. At Clash of the Champions II, the Sheepherders faced off against the NWA United States Tag Team Champions the Fantastics, but did not win the gold. At Clash of the Champions III, the Sheepherders lost to Steve Williams and Nikita Koloff despite the interference of Rip Morgan. Just as it looked like the Sheepherders were going to face the Fantastics in the finals of a tournament to crown new United States tag team champions, Luke and Butch signed with Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Federation.\n\nLuke and Butch signed on with the WWF in the midst of its aggressive national expansion giving them a national and international exposure unlike anything they had ever had before. The team changed their name to The Bushwhackers and changed their violent style to a comedic style which was an instant hit with the fans. The comedy act involved licking, arm motions, and more. The Bushwhackers made their debut on 3 January 1989 on a \"WWF Superstars of Wrestling\" taping.\n\nIn February, the Bushwhackers began a feud with The Fabulous Rougeau Brothers, the first feud to really feature the Bushwhackers on WWF television. The two teams took their conflict to WrestleMania V, which saw the Bushwhackers victorious in their WWF Pay Per View debut as a team. The WrestleMania match was not the end of the Bushwhackers/Rougeau feud, as the teams clashed again on 14 October \"Saturday Night's Main Event XXIII\" (taped 21 September); again, the Bushwhackers were victorious. The Bushwhackers and the Rougeaus clashed twice more, first at the 1989 Survivor Series and again at the 1990 Royal Rumble; the Bushwhackers got the best of the Rougeau brothers both times.\n\nDuring this time, the Bushwhackers were featured in a long series of comedic vignettes, usually subjecting \"Mean\" Gene to their wild and wacky ways (and sardine eating antics). These vignettes were often featured on Coliseum Home Video releases where they served as the \"link\" between matches.\n\nBy 1990, the Bushwhackers were established as a solid mid-card comedy act feuding with the newly established heel team known as Rhythm and Blues (The Honky Tonk Man and Greg Valentine). The Bushwhackers' WrestleMania VI appearance came at the expense of Rhythm and Blues as they showed up during a segment, attacked Honky Tonk Man and Valentine, and then broke R & B's guitars to the delight of the crowd. At Survivor Series 1990, Luke and Butch teamed up with Nikolai Volkoff and Tito Santana to form \"The Alliance\" and take on Sgt. Slaughter, Boris Zhukov, and the Orient Express team dubbed \"The Mercenaries\". The Bushwhackers eliminated the Orient Express but were eliminated themselves as well.\n\nAt the 1991 Royal Rumble, Luke set a rather unfortunate record as he lasted a total of 4 seconds. Using the trademark arm-swing entrance, he climbed into the ring, walked across in a straight path, and was thrown over the top rope by Earthquake. In a televised 6-man tag-team match, the Bushwhackers teamed with Tugboat against Earthquake and the Nasty Boys; Tugboat turned on his partners after a few minutes of action and joined Earthquake in laying the two New Zealanders out cold. After the heel turn Tugboat changed his name to Typhoon and together they became known as \"The Natural Disasters\". The Bushwhackers demanded a chance to get even with the big team but were easily defeated at the 1991 SummerSlam PPV. After destroying the Bushwhackers, the Disasters targeted André the Giant who was at ringside on crutches due to an injury. The assault was stopped by the Legion of Doom who ran off the Natural Disasters.\n\nAfter the Natural Disasters began feuding with the Legion of Doom, the Bushwhackers came across a team that was the total opposite of what they were. Luke and Butch the fun loving, \"working class\" guys started a feud with the rich, snobby bratty Beverly Brothers (Blake Beverly and Beau Beverly). The two teams first clashed at the 1991 Survivor Series where they were on opposite sides in a 4 on 4 elimination match. On that night, the Beverly Brothers got the upper hand and eliminated both Luke and Butch. The Beverly Brothers' manager The Genius kept interfering in the matches so the Bushwhackers brought in a manager of their own, the nerdy Jamison. Unfortunately even the addition of Jamison was not enough to prevent the Beverly Brothers from winning at Royal Rumble 1992. In 1993, the Bushwhackers were used to \"put over\" the newly signed team the Headshrinkers (Fatu and Samu) and made a few appearances in comedy matches alongside midget \"Tiger\" Jackson (later Dink \"The Clown\") against the Beverly Brothers and \"Little\" Louie.\n\nIn November, Luke and Butch helped Doink the Clown in the clown's feud with Bam Bam Bigelow. Luke and Butch, as well as Mo and Mabel, all appeared at Survivor Series 1993 wearing the trademark green wig and facepaint associated with Doink the Clown. The Bushwhackers and Men on a Mission defeated Bigelow, Bastion Booger, and the Headshrinkers in a match that played more for laughs than serious wrestling. The team also faced another recently signed team: Steven Dunn and Timothy Well also known as Well Dunn. By 1995, the Bushwhackers were used almost exclusively to put over teams such as The Blu Twins.\n\nIn March 1996, the Bushwhackers return were beaten in the first round of a tournament for the tag titles by eventual winners The Bodydonnas (Skip and Zip). When the Bushwhackers returned in 1996, it was a slightly revamped version that ignored the fact that both members were from New Zealand as they displayed traditional Australian Stereotypes, including being accompanied to the ring by a giant kangaroo mascot. On 14 September, the Bushwhackers made their last appearance while under contract with the WWF.\n\nAfter leaving the WWF, the team made special appearances in the independent circuit. This included a return to WWC for its 24th Anniversary show where they were billed as the Sheepherders and took on old rivals Invaders I & II. They also appeared at a special event in Amarillo to celebrate \"50 years of Funk\" where they lost to old rivals Mark and Chris Youngblood.\n\nThey made two appearances for Extreme Championship Wrestling in April 1998. They wrestled Tommy Dremaer and The Sandman to a no contest. Then wrestled Chris Chetti and Jerry Lynn.\n\nIn 1999, the Bushwhackers participated in a \"wrestling nostalgia\" PPV called Heroes of Wrestling. Luke and Butch took on and defeated former WWF Tag Team Champions The Iron Sheik and Nikolai Volkoff. Luke and Butch made one of their last appearances as active wrestlers on 1 April 2001, when they participated in the \"Gimmick Battle Royal\" at WrestleMania X-Seven. On 15 June, the team returned to Memphis one last time, fighting The Moondogs to a double Disqualification on a special \"Mid-South Clash of the Legends\" show.\n\nIn 2002 Luke started working behind the scenes as a booker in IWA Puerto Rico, retiring from active competition. Butch also retied from wrestling as well.\n\nIn December 2007, Wickens again appeared on a wrestling program as Bushwhacker Luke. Wrestler Eric Young hosted a party on the Christmas-themed episode of Impact, and his family turned out to be the Bushwhackers.\n\nIt was announced by WWE on 23 February 2015 on \"Raw\" and the official website, that the Bushwhackers will be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2015.\n\nLuke has started making semi regular appearances with Ring of Honor starting with the final two shows of 2007, Rising Above and Final Battle. He mostly signs autographs and takes pictures with fans but has appeared in several angles and matches. Luke now hosts the Luke Williams show for Ring of Honor podcasts where he interviews ROH wrestlers.\n\nOn 9 January 2008 in Adrian Michigan Luke made his in ring return after 6 years out of the ring. He teamed with Big Chuck Wagon and lost to the BNU in the first round of a tag team titles tournament for Championship International Wrestling.\n\nOn 26 July 2008 in Detroit, Michigan Luke participated in the first ever Honor Rumble where the winner received a future ROH World Title shot. He was eliminated by Necro Butcher.\n\nIn September 2013 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada Luke teamed with Odjig Thundercloud and defeated the Royal Guards to capture the Victory Commonwealth Wrestling Tag Team Championships.\n\nIn February 2018, the Bushwhackers reunited for one last tour of their native New Zealand. On 10 February, Bushwhacker Luke defeated Simon Seven at UCW's Invasion show, in Christchurch As well as defeating James Shaw at IPW's Kiwi as mate show, in Auckland.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1983400", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1983400", "title": "Bruce Hart (wrestler)", "text": "Bruce Hart (wrestler)\n\nBruce Ambrose Edwardious Hart Sr., possibly Bruce Dennis Luis Hart Sr. (born January 13, 1950) is an American-Canadian retired professional wrestler, promoter, booker, trainer and school teacher. He is a second-generation wrestler and a member of the Hart wrestling family, being the second child of Stu and Helen Hart. He is best known for his time in Stampede Wrestling and several appearances for WWE, often with his brothers Bret and Owen.\n\nAs a wrestler Hart carried a number of championships, including the Stampede North American Heavyweight Championship and participated in WWF's Survivor Series.\n\nWhile his mother was pregnant with Hart she and her husband Stu suffered an automobile accident. This resulted in his older brother Smith being cared for by their maternal grandparents for almost two years while Helen recovered in the hospital.\n\nHe is of Greek descent through his maternal grandmother and Irish through his maternal grandfather. His father was mainly of Scots-Irish descent but also had Scottish and English ancestry. Hart is a dual citizen of Canada and the United States.\n\nBruce Hart began his wrestling training in 1971, at the age of 21, in his father's training school \"The Dungeon\". Trained by Stu Hart, Bruce, like the rest of his family, was trained in and focused on a technically sound, amateur wrestling style.\n\nHe debuted in 1972, in his fathers Calgary promotion, Stampede Wrestling, tag teaming with Dan Kroffat in the main event, against North American Champion Kendo Nagasaki and Lord Sloan. For the next six months he remained a headline performer for the promotion, working against the likes of John Quinn, Benny Ramirez, Frank Butcher, Tor Kamata, Chatti Yokuchi and Yasu Fuji. In June 1973, he suffered a serious shoulder injury which sidelined him for 9 months and nearly finished his career. He returned in the summer of 1974, and continued as performer in Western Canada. Hart kept wrestling on and off but had relatively few matches until after 1977.\n\nIn 1977 he traveled to the United Kingdom, where he wrestled under the name \"Bronco\" Bruce Hart for the London based Joint Promotions.\n\nWhile there, he met a young Tom Billington and offered him an opportunity to wrestle for Stampede, which Billington declined. After a falling out with Joint Promotions, Billington, using the ring name Dynamite Kid, traveled to Canada and joined Stampede. Dynamite quickly became a huge star in Western Canada and, as a result, Hart invited his younger cousin, Smith to also come to Western Canada. Smith, who originally wrestled as Young David, later became known as Davey Boy Smith (after British lightweight boxing champion - Dave Boy Green) after Hart decided that it was a better ring name.\n\nIn 1978 Hart and Billington worked together as a tag team in the German promotion Catch Wrestling Association, they wrestled against Angel Grey and Michael Seitz. Hart also worked in singles matches against Seitz.\n\nFrom 1979 until 1984, Hart was in large part in charge of matchmaking and talent development, selling out regularly and producing a myriad of successful wrestlers, including: Jake Roberts, the Junkyard Dog, Jim Neidhart, \"Dr. D.\" Dave Shultz, Honky Tonk Man, Bad News Allen (aka Bad News Brown) and Bret \"the Hitman\" Hart, the period was one where the company was generally breaking even.\n\nIn 1979 Hart won his first championship, the Stampede World Mid-Heavyweight Title from Dick Steinborn. In 1980 Hart won two championships, the World Mid-Heavyweight Title for a second time and the Stampede British Commonwealth Mid-Heavyweight Title. By the end of 1982 Hart won the Stampede British Commonwealth Mid-Heavyweight Championship two times and then a third time by the beginning of 1983.\n\nIn 1983 Hart worked for New Japan Pro Wrestling in their NJPW Bloody Fight Series. There he worked in singles matches against wrestlers such as Kengo Kimura, Kantaro Hoshino, Ryuma Go, Kuniaki Kobayashi and in tag team matches with wrestlers such as Bad News Allen and Tony St. Clair against Akira Maeda and Kengo Kimura with the former and against Isamu Teranishi and Rusher Kimura with the later as well as participating in three man tag matches with Dick Murdoch and Tony St. Clair against Antonio Inoki, Osamu Kido and Seiji Sakaguchi. Hart later in the year returned to Stampede. In March 1984 while back in Stampede Hart became Stampede International Tag Team Champion together with Davey Boy Smith.\n\nHart returned to New Japan in early April 1984 for the NJPW Big Fight Series where he primarily wrestled in singles matches, several of which were with Norio Honaga but also against other wrestlers such as Nobuhiko Takada, Tatsutoshi Goto, Masanobu Kurisu, Makoto Arakawa, Fumihiro Niikura, Isamu Teranishi. He also took part in one known tag match, partnering with Hercules Ayala against Haruka Eigen and Kantaro Hoshino.\n\nNear the end of 1984, Bruce's father, Stu, accepted an offer from WWF president, Vince McMahon, to sell the promotion for $1,000,000, plus 10% of all subsequent WWF gates in Western Canada to the WWF. As part of the deal, several Stampede superstars, including Bret Hart, Dynamite Kid, Davey Boy and Neidhart also joined the WWF. However, several months later, Bruce violated the terms of the agreement by assisting a rival promotion in the territory, leading McMahon to renege on the deal.\n\nAs a result, near the end of 1985, Stu Hart decided to re-open the promotion with Bruce running most of it. Initially, the promotion, which had been hurt by the loss of most of its well-known wrestlers, struggled to remain afloat. As a consequence, Bruce chose to feature a new, edgier and more hard core style of wrestling - featuring villains: the Karachi Vice (Makhan and Vokhan Singh and the Great Gama), the Viet Cong Express (Hiroshi Hase and Nubohiko Niikura) Jason the Terrible, the masked Zodiak (Barry Orton) and younger babyfaces, such as Owen Hart, Ben Bassarab, Chris Benoit, Jushin Thunder Liger and the tag team Badd Company (Bruce Hart and Brian Pillman). In short order, the promotion would survive for the next several years, drawing reasonable gates and turning out a number of performers who would go on to have decent careers in other companies after the promotion's collapse. Despite this, the promotion suffered backstage due to Bruce and his father Stu having grave disagreements about how to handle storylines. The promotion shut down in 1989 when Stu's promoter's license expired and they could not afford to pay for a new one.\n\nDuring this period Hart won five titles, the Stampede British Commonwealth Mid-Heavyweight Championship for the fifth time, the Stampede British Commonwealth Mid-Heavyweight Championship for the sixth time, the Stampede International Tag Team Championship for the third time with Brian Pillman as Badd Company, the Stampede International Tag Team Championship for the fourth time, again with Brian Pillman and the Stampede British Commonwealth Mid-Heavyweight Championship for the seventh time.\n\nHart has made several appearances with his brothers Bret and Owen in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). Bruce made his first appearance on the August 16th, 1992 episode of WWF Superstars, where he sided with Davey Boy Smith in the run-up to SummerSlam 92. Bruce made his first in-ring appearance at the 1993 Survivor Series pay-per-view, teaming with his brothers Bret, Owen and Keith to take on Shawn Michaels and his \"Knights\" (The Red Knight, The Blue Knight and The Black Knight). The Knights theme was used as the team was supposed to be led by Jerry \"The King\" Lawler, who was having legal troubles at the same time as his feud with Bret Hart and was replaced by Michaels. The Hart Brothers won the match, with Owen being the only team member eliminated.\n\nOwen's failure ignited a lengthy feud between Bret and Owen that would last for several years. The Owen and Bret feud was originally conceived as a feud between Bret and Bruce but Bret proposed to make it between him and Owen instead as he believed the dynamic for them would be superior. At the 1994 SummerSlam, the two brothers competed in a Steel Cage match for the WWF Championship. Bruce and several Hart brothers interfered in the match by climbing the cage. Bruce also appeared on an episode of \"Monday Night Raw\" in the summer of 1994.\n\nIn 1996 Bruce Hart made a comeback to the ring with the independent New York based promotion Ultimate Championship Wrestling (UCW), where he wrestled with the likes of Chris Chavis, his brother-in-law Jim \"The Anvil\" Neidhart, Falcon Coperis, and Marty Jannetty and feuding with wrestlers such as Tiger Khan.\n\nIn UCW Hart was involved in and developed a nWo type storyline in which he and former WWE wrestlers portrayed greedy lazy fat-cat type villains who looked down on and used the younger rookie talent at the shows to make money and gain power in the promotion.\n\nHart was instrumental in the development of the young talent of the UCW.\n\nBruce's next WWF appearance was at when he interfered in the main event which pitted The Hart Foundation (Bret Hart, Owen Hart, British Bulldog, Brian Pillman and Jim Neidhart) against Stone Cold Steve Austin, Ken Shamrock, Goldust and Legion of Doom (Hawk and Animal). Bruce played a key role in the finish of the match as he scuffled with Austin, allowing Owen to score the pinfall victory over Austin.\n\nBruce's next and most recent appearance in the renamed WWE was at WrestleMania XXVI, where he was the surprise Special Guest Referee for his brother Bret's first WWE match in 13 years, a No Holds Barred Lumberjack match against the WWE chairman Vince McMahon. McMahon thought that Bruce and the rest of Hart family were at his side, but they all turned on him and helped Bret win the match.\n\nHart has attempted to revive Stampede Wrestling numerous times. In the late 90s Hart collaborated with his brother Ross Hart as promoters and bookers, this incarnation of Stampede Wrestling featured many third-generation members of the Hart family, including Natalya Neidhart, Teddy Hart and David Hart Smith.\n\nIn 2001 Hart won the Stampede North American Heavyweight Championship for the first time. In 2002 he won four titles, the Stampede International Tag Team Titles a fifth time with his nephew Teddy Hart, the Stampede British Commonwealth Mid-Heavyweight Championship for the eight and last time, the Stampede North American Heavyweight Championship as well as the Stampede International Tag Team Championships for the last time with TJ Wilson.\n\nOne of Hart's last match for his and Ross's incarnation of Stampede Wrestling was in June 2003 in a match for the Stampede British Commonwealth Mid-Heavyweight Title against Duke Durrango which Hart lost, leaving over the title to Durrango.\n\nIn 2011 Hart wrestled in a Four-On-Three-Handicap-Match for Stampede Next Generation Stampede Wrestling together with his nephew Teddy Hart and Hal Eagletail against Big Jess, DerRic Super Starlight, The Inuit Warrior and Wyatt Beaver.\n\nIn 2012 Hart wrestled his last match for Real Canadian Wrestlings 9th Anniversary Show in a Six-Man-Tag-Team-No-Disqualiication where he wrestled against Andrew Hawks, Kid Kash and nephew Teddy Hart together with Heavy Metal and Tommy Lee Curtis.\n\nHe was a trainer at the original Hart Brothers University wrestling school during the 1990s. In June 2013, Hart resurrected the wrestling school. He continues to train wrestlers at the school together with his sons Torrin and Bruce Jr. in his hometown of Calgary, AB. Some of the wrestlers he has trained include Chris Benoit, David Hart Smith, Natalya, Teddy Hart and Tyson Kidd.\n\nSince 2014 Hart has a weekly column and runs a podcast for the multimedia website PWP Nation formerly co hosted by wrestler and journalist Jordan Garber and Jay Alletto.\n\nHart has appeared on several wrestling documentaries, including the 2010 documentary which is about his younger brother Bret Hart and the WWE released in which he has a segment dedicated to his career.\n\nHe was also present on the stage when his father Stu Hart was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2011 Hart published an autobiography entitled \"Straight from the Hart\".\n\nHe has five children with his ex-wife, Andrea Hart: daughters Brit and Lara and sons Torrin, Bruce Jr. and Rhettger Hart. Rhett was born three months premature and suffers from cerebral palsy. Two of Bruce Hart's sons, Bruce Jr and Torrin, have been involved in pro wrestling.\n\nHart and his wife Andrea separated for a period from 2000 and Andrea started a relationship with Hart's former brother-in-law Davey Boy Smith until Smith's death in 2002. Andrea and Hart later reconciled but separated again after a time. Andrea died on December 27, 2019 at the age of 52.\n\n\n"}

The station is owned by Weigel Broadcasting. KAZA-TV's studios are located on Grand Central Avenue in Glendale, and its transmitter is located atop Mount Harvard. None of the station's assets are physically located on Santa Catalina Island, despite its city of license of Avalon.\n\nKAZA-TV was previously an Azteca América owned-and-operated station from 2001 until 2018.\n\nThe station first signed on the air on July 9, 2001, originally operating as an independent station, carrying a format of Spanish-language music videos temporarily until the launch of Azteca América on July 28. The station was founded by Visalia-based Pappas Telecasting (which initially held a 75% majority stake in the station, which expanded to 80% in 2014) and TV Azteca (which owned the remaining interest).\n\nOn November 30, 2006, NBC Universal (owner of rival KVEA, channel 52 and then-owner of KWHY, channel 22) filed a petition with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to deny KAZA's license renewal, on basis that TV Azteca controlled 51.6% of the station (above the FCC-designated 33% interest limit for foreign owned broadcasters) via loans and other interests. According to the \"Los Angeles Times\", it is believed to be the first challenge to a license renewal sent to the FCC since 1979 (notwithstanding the two-decade long RKO General license challenges including KHJ-TV that were not fully sorted until the late 1980s).\n\nAccording to the filing, NBC Universal accused TV Azteca of attempting to undermine its operations in Mexico. One example cited is the shutdown of production of the Telemundo program \"Quinceañera\". NBC Universal accused TV Azteca of hiring undercover police officers to enforce the shutdown; the show's production was moved to Miami as a result. Two days later, Azteca chairman, Luis Echarte, insisted that the local marketing agreement is legitimate and called NBC Universal's allegations \"ridiculous\", citing that: \"It's obviously a ploy to damage our image, given our strong performance in the U.S.,\" he says. \"KAZA is owned by Pappas. We’ve been paying rent to Pappas to operate the station for three years.\" \nOn September 8, 2017, Pappas Telecasting and TV Azteca announced they would sell KAZA to Chicago-based Weigel Broadcasting for $9 million. On January 1, 2018, KJLA (channel 57) replaced KAZA as the Azteca America affiliate for the Los Angeles market.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 11, 2001. In the episode, Bart and his father, Homer, are sentenced by the cruel judge Constance Harm to be tethered to each other as a result of Bart stealing Police Chief Wiggum's car. Eventually, Homer's wife, Marge, is fed up with the punishment and cuts the rope, which instead leads to Judge Harm sentencing them to have their heads and hands locked up in wooden stocks.\n\nThe episode was written by George Meyer and Mike Scully, who also served as the show runner for the episode, and Mark Kirkland worked as the director. The writers based the story on “a couple of incidents” in real life in which troublesome children, through alternative sentencing, were tethered to their parents. The episode marks the first appearance of the infamous and notoriously cruel Judge Constance Harm, who is voiced by actress Jane Kaczmarek.\n\nWhen it was first broadcast, “The Parent Rap” was watched by 14.4 million viewers, making it the second most watched show of its timeslot that night. After its release on DVD and Blu-ray, however, the episode garnered mixed reviews from critics.\n\nAfter missing the bus, Bart and Milhouse are forced to walk to school, but they get into trouble and are arrested for stealing Chief Wiggum's squad car. Milhouse gets off but when Bart comes to the bench, Judge Constance Harm (voiced by Jane Kaczmarek) takes over while Judge Snyder is on his fishing trip and lays down the law. She holds Homer responsible for Bart's deeds and sentences he and Bart to be tethered together. Initially, the tethering brings Bart and Homer closer together, despite Homer disrupting Bart's education and later getting cut up by glass during a baseball game. However, things soon go wrong, such as Bart being left outside in the cold while Homer drinks at Moe's, and again when Marge and Homer try to make love when Bart does his homework, leading father and son to fight one another.\n\nMarge finally gets fed up with the punishment and cuts the tether. Only now, she and Homer get brought back before Judge Harm and have their heads and hands locked up in old-fashioned wooden stocks, as well as being slapped on the buttocks from passing cars. Not being able to bear the punishment any longer, they break free and decide to get back at the judge. When the plan goes awry, they accidentally sink the judge's houseboat and are once again brought into court. Bart pleads to take full responsibility for his parents actions. Judge Harm agrees by sentencing Bart to 5 years in Juvenile Hall, but just as she is ready to bang her gavel, Judge Snyder returns from his fishing trip and declares a verdict of \"Boys will be boys,\" dismissing the case. While driving home afterwards, Marge makes the entire family promise not to break the law again for a whole year, which Homer instantly breaks when he runs over Hans Moleman.\n\n\"The Parent Rap\" was co-written by George Meyer and Mike Scully, and Mark Kirkland served as the director for the episode. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on November 11, 2001. The title of the episode is a reference to \"The Parent Trap\". Even though \"Treehouse of Horror XII\" - the first episode of the thirteenth season - had aired the previous week, \"The Parent Rap\" was considered the official premiere of the season. \"The Parent Rap\" was the last episode written in its production line. \"As I recall, we got toward the end of the season and we had to write another episode in a hurry\", said Meyer in a DVD audio commentary for the episode. Judge Constance Harm is a parody of \"Judge Judy\".\n\nThe writing staff contributed a rough outline for the episode, and Meyer and Scully went into one of the writer's room and \"basically, kind of locked [themselves] in for five days\" writing the episode. Meyer and Scully both thoroughly enjoyed the writing process of the episode; \"It really came together easily\", stated Meyer, \"...because we had known each other so long and were comfortable with each other's style\". Ian Maxtone-Graham, one of the writers for \"The Simpsons\", commented that the draft Meyer and Scully had written was \"awfully good\".\n\nThe episode was based on \"a couple of incidents\" that the writers had heard about in which troublesome children, through alternative sentencing, were tethered to their parents. The scene in which Homer and Marge get spanked by Springfield's citizens as part of their punishment was also based on an alternative sentencing, in which the sentenced had to wear certain shirts or signs that indicated whether they, for example, had not paid taxes. The scene in which Bart accidentally drives away with Chief Wiggum's police car was based on one of Scully's friends in high school, who stole a still running police car parked at a Dunkin' Donuts while the police were in the store.\n\nThe episode featured the first appearance of Judge Constance Harm, portrayed by American actress Jane Kaczmarek. The character's name was conceived by Meyer, who had always thought that Constance was a scary name.\n\nThe episode makes several references to Blue Öyster Cult's hit song \"(Don't Fear) The Reaper\", which also plays during the episode's end credits, and inspired the title of a later episode. Meyer later got to meet the band, who said that they were \"stoked\" to be referenced in a \"Simpsons\" episode.\n\nIn its original American broadcast on November 11, 2001, \"The Parent Rap\" was seen by approximately 14.4 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research. The episode received a 6.9 rating/16 share among adults between ages 18 and 49, making it the second most-watched television show of the night in its demographic. The episode was listed among the 15 most watched shows in its demographic that week.\n\nFollowing the episode's broadcast, as well as the home video release of thirteenth season of \"The Simpsons\", \"The Parent Rap\" received generally mixed reviews from critics.\n\nWriting for the \"Daily News\", Eric Mink gave the episode a mixed review. \"To be sure, the show has its moments\", wrote Mink, \"But there's not much zip here, and the show has, of all things, a warm-and-fuzzy ending... 'The Simpsons' and warm-and-fuzzy is not a healthy combination\".\n\nNate Boss of Project-Blu described the episode as \"filler\" and praised the episode's concept, but criticized how the episode was executed.\n\nColin Jacobsson of DVD Movie Guide also gave the episode a mixed response, and wrote that \"'Rap' starts with a clever – if absurd – concept\", but \"does little to churn good comedy out of its theme\", and concluded by calling the episode \"disappointing\".\n\nJennifer Malkowski, reviewing the season for DVD Verdict, was more positive towards the episode. Giving the episode a rating of B+, Malkowski listed \"The Parent Rap\" among episodes in the season where \"We see wacky scenarios force Homer to bond with his family, to a rather heartwarming effect\".\n\nRon Martin of 411Mania was also favorable, calling the episode \"decent\". \n\n"}

As the Lighthouse Authority for the island of Ireland it oversees the coastal lights and navigation marks provided by the local lighthouse authorities, the county councils and port authorities.\n\nIt is funded by light dues paid by ships calling at ports in the Republic of Ireland, pooled with dues raised similarly in the United Kingdom. This recognises that a large volume of shipping, typically transatlantic, relies on the lights provided by the Irish Lights.\n\nSignal fires to guide shipping have long existed. Hook Head has the oldest nearly continuous light in Ireland, originally a signal fire or beacon tended by the monk Dubhán in the fifth century. Monks continued to maintain the light until the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland in 1641.\n\nKing Charles II re-established the lighthouse in 1667. He granted a patent for the erection of six lighthouses to Robert Reading, some replacing older lighthouses, at Hook Head, Baily Lighthouse at Howth Head, Howth sand-bar, Old Head of Kinsale, Barry Oge's castle (now Charlesfort, near Kinsale), and the Isle of Magee.\n\nIn 1704 Queen Anne transferred the lighthouses around the Irish coast to the Revenue Commissioners.\n\nThe Commissioners of Irish Lights, or \"CIL\", were established under an Act of the Parliament of Ireland passed in 1786 and entitled \"An Act for Promoting the Trade of Dublin, by rendering its Port and Harbour more commodious\" (26 Geo. III, c. xix). Lighthouses were not included until the 1810 Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. These Acts, as confirmed by the Irish Lights Commissioners (Adaptation) Order, 1935, remain the legislative basis for the CIL.\n\nIrish Lights has moved its headquarters from Dublin to a purpose-built new building in Harbour Road, Dún Laoghaire.\n\nThe services provided by the Commissioners are financed from the General Lighthouse Fund. The income of the General Lighthouse Fund is mainly derived from light dues charged on commercial shipping at ports in Ireland and the United Kingdom, (i.e. user pays) supplemented by an annual contribution from the Irish Government towards the cost of the service provided by the Commissioners in Ireland.\n\nThe General Lighthouse Fund is administered by the UK Department for Transport. It also finances:\n\nThe accounts of the Commissioners of Irish Lights are consolidated with those of Trinity House Lighthouse Service and the Northern Lighthouse Board to form part of the General Lighthouse Fund annual accounts which are published in London by HMSO.\n\nThe Commissioners currently have only one light tender in service named . The hull was built at Galaţi shipyard, Romania, in 2000 and fitted out at Damen Shipyards in the Netherlands. She is registered in Dublin and has a , has a length overall of 79.6 m and a beam of 15.99 m. She is the third vessel named Granuaile to have served the Commissioners. Granuaile II was in service between 1970 and 2000, and she was preceded by the first Granuaile from 1948 to 1970.\nBecause of the automation of lighthouses, and the extensive use of helicopters by the Commissioners, CIL now need only one tender in service. The ship has diesel electric propulsion and is extremely manoeuvrable, and is therefore ideal for her role in maintaining the automatic navigation buoys in Irish waters. In 2003 she was involved in the recovery of the fishing boat \"Pisces\", which sank off Fethard, County Wexford, in July 2002.\n\n\nCommissioners of Irish Lights is a cross-border body, with its headquarters in Dublin. The current flag of the Irish Lights features lightships and lighthouses between the arms of the St. Patrick's Cross. The St. George's Cross was used until 1970. CIL vessels in Northern Ireland fly the Blue Ensign defaced with the Commissioner's badge and those in the Republic fly the Irish tricolour.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1983417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1983417", "title": "Michael Gorman (librarian)", "text": "Michael Gorman (librarian)\n\nMichael Gorman (born 6 March 1941 in Witney, Oxfordshire) is a British-born librarian, library scholar and editor/writer on library issues noted for his traditional views. During his tenure as president of the American Library Association (ALA), he was vocal in his opinions on a range of subjects, notably technology and education. He currently lives in the Chicago area with his wife, Anne Reuland, an academic administrator at Loyola University.\n\nGorman's principles of librarianship derive from core liberal, democratic and humanist values. A key influence is S.R. Ranganathan, whom he regarded as \"the greatest figure of librarianship in the 20th century.\" He maintains that it is through focusing on core professional values that librarians will facilitate personal growth and enhance the success of their institutions.\n\nGorman grew up in London, England and became interested in libraries in part through his experiences at Hendon library and particularly its Children's Library run by a pioneer in the field Eileen Colwell. He attended Ealing Technical College (now University of West London) in London from 1964-1966.\n\nHe has also taught at library schools in Britain and in the United States, most recently at the UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies.\n\nGorman bases his principles of librarianship on core liberal, democratic and humanistic values. Underlying Gorman’s fervent defense of his values of librarianship is a strong apprehension regarding the future of the profession.\n\nIn \"Our Enduring Values\", Gorman identified eight central values of librarianship :\n\n\nThese Eight Values have been heavily influenced by the Buddhist Noble Eightfold path.\n\nGorman’s selection and defence of his eight central values has attracted some criticism: for example, his championing of ‘stewardship’ as a central ethical tenet unique to librarianship, which cannot be shared by other information professionals, has been attacked as “too narrow and exclusive”. His impassioned defence of intellectual freedom has also been dismissed in some quarters as “empty rhetoric” and “hyperbole”. Gorman’s views have also been dismissed by some as seemingly contradictory: on the one hand he praises Ranganathan's core values of library science; on the other he claims \"information science\" is a “bogus discipline”. After a careful reading of Gorman's use of the phrase \"bogus discipline,\" one can see that his beliefs are not in contradiction to Ranganathan, however, as he is supplying a critique of library science schools in what he views as a departure from the core values that should be taught.\n\nGorman has expanded and added a more contemporary focus to Ranganathan’s Five Laws of Library Science. The re-working of the classic five laws is an attempt “to meet the challenges of fast paced social and cultural changes affecting library users and the rapid proliferation of technology in library operations”.\nThe five laws are:\n\nAs part of his platform when running for ALA President in 2006, Gorman pledged to address what he called the education crisis.\n\nThe article \"Whither Library Education?\" set out his views on the current state of LIS education. He concluded that LIS education had become technocentric, male-dominated and out of touch with the needs of practitioners. This view was critiqued by Dillon and Norris, while both papers were critiqued by Pawley for their treatment of the issue of gender in librarianship.\n\nLibrary and Information Science academics also responded in the professional press, questioning whether there was a crisis to address.\n\nDuring his year in office, Gorman introduced an initiative intended to discuss the issue of education. Sessions were held with practitioners and academics. However, Gorman’s traditional views may have led to younger librarians turning away from the idea and their views not being represented:\n\n“Whatever the case, after all that effort we still don’t know what current students and recent graduates really think about the educations upon which they spend so much money.”\nDespite the initiative, accreditation and curricula remained unchanged at the end of Gorman’s tenure.\n\nGorman's views on the Internet, digitisation of books, Google, citizen journalism, and information science are widely discussed. Two publications in particular caused heated debate, particularly within the librarian blogging community:\n\n\nIn 2004 Google announced its plan to digitize the collections of five major research libraries. This would allow both Google and the libraries in question, The University of Michigan, Oxford, New York Public, Harvard and Stanford, to have access to digitized copies of millions of texts. Michael Gorman, then ALA president, responded to this announcement with an article in the Los Angeles Times 'Google and God's Mind' where he made clear his disapproval of the digitisation project. This disapproval was based on what he sees as a clear distinction between information and real knowledge. Gorman defines information as facts, data, images and quotations that can be used out of context, while real knowledge denotes literary and scholarly texts. This distinction informs Gorman’s observations about online information retrieval which he characterises as being more focused on quick and easy access to facts.\n\nIn his later article, Gorman argues that to \"Google boosters\", speed is of the greatest import: \"...just as it is to consumers of fast “food”, but, as with fast food, rubbish is rubbish, no matter how speedily it is delivered\". However, he suggests that real knowledge is acquired through a traditional scholarly approach to books.\n\nGorman later gave this opinion on digitising books:\n\n...massive databases of digitized whole books, especially scholarly books, are expensive exercises in futility based on the staggering notion that, for the first time in history, one form of communication (electronic) will supplant and obliterate all previous forms.\nDigital Initiatives Technology Librarian Peter Binkley discussed this view on his blog and also noted that a digitisation project does not necessarily involve shredding the books once they are scanned. He even suggests that Gorman himself highlights how digitised databases like Google’s make it possible for users to find books and order them by inter-library loan. He also refutes Gorman’s \"for the first time in history\" claim mentioning two previous \"transformations\" of information delivery over the last couple of millennia: the move from papyrus to vellum codex and the move from manuscript to the printed book. Overall, Binkley felt that, as ALA president-elect, Gorman should accept that digitisation of books is inevitable and that he should \"make himself useful by working to ensure that this reformatting goes well\".\n\nIn 2006, during his term as head of the ALA, Gorman attended the Online Information Conference in London, where he criticised the library profession for being \"too interested in technology\".\n\nGorman, however, is not opposed to digitising books per se, but feels that particular types of information, such as inter alia dictionaries, encyclopaedias and gazetteers are suitable candidates for digitisation, while other forms of real knowledge such as whole books (especially scholarly books) and large databases are not suitable for digitisation.\n\nMany of the responses to Gorman's article were voiced in the digital domain, with many library and information themed blogs criticising Gorman's opinions, although some bloggers agreed with some of Gorman's stance on digitisation.\nGorman credits these responses as making him aware of blogging and leading to him writing Revenge of the Blog People!, in which he criticises the blogging medium and the opinions of his critics.\nThis led to further heated discussion, firstly on blogs then in the professional press. Karen Schneider, an ALA member who writes the Free Range Librarian blog, dubbed the controversy \"Gormangate\" and shared her concerns about how his words portrayed the library profession, which was subsequently picked up by the professional press.\n\"Library Journal\", which published Gorman's piece, commented on the decision to publish the piece, noting that the discussion had been beneficial and that:\n\nThe power of the blogosphere as a new way to communicate ideas and spread news electronically has been reinforced for all [Library Journal staff].\n\nThe journal went on to announce that they would be carrying a technology blog on their website.\n\nOne blogger, Michael Stephens, who wrote an open letter to Gorman, which he published on his blog, was so inspired by the subject that he chose to write his doctoral thesis on blogging in librarianship.\n\nMichael Gorman went on to create blog entries of his own for the Encyclopædia Britannica Blog. In the entry “Web 2.0: The Sleep of Reason,” he notes how the rise of Web 2.0 has contributed to “an increase in credulity and an associated flight from expertise.” In “Siren Song of the Internet,” he writes that, although the Internet has shaped our lives in many ways for the better, “we must exercise judgment, use digital resources intelligently, and import into the digital world the values that have pervaded scholarship in Western societies for many centuries.” In “Jabberwiki: The Educational Response,” he states that discussed how the Web offers texts that are of “doubtful or unestablishable authenticity” how using the Web for research can lead to incomplete research, and the dubious nature of Web-based learning. Finally, in “Challenging the Technophiles,” Gorman argues in favor of “sustained reading of complex texts” but notes that Google and the Internet are not helpful in that endeavor.\n\nDespite holding such an influential position in the American Library Association, Gorman has made it clear that many of his criticisms are personal and not representative of the ALA. For example, on technology and the Google digitisation, Gorman says:\n\nWhile Gorman maintains that he is voicing his own opinion, it was commented that when he is identified as the president of the largest professional library organisation in North America:\n\n...his words have huge legal, political and economic consequences for the entire information science profession.\nIn regards to Wikipedia, Gorman once stated that “a professor who encourages the use of Wikipedia is the intellectual equivalent of a dietician who recommends a steady diet of Big Macs with everything.”\n\nOther commentators have also noted that irrespective of his protestations, the perception on the wider world and the media is that Gorman represents the profession and this can be detrimental to public perception of librarians.\n\nGorman noted with alarm the results of an adult literacy assessment, which showed that reading proficiency of college graduates has declined in the past decade. He said he has been shocked by how few new freshmen understand how to use basic library systems, or enjoy reading for pleasure. \"There is a failure in the core values of education,\" he said. \"They're told to go to college in order to get a better job -- and that's okay. But the real task is to produce educated people.\" \n\nGorman has spoken extensively on the problems facing library education, particularly in the USA. He proposes the need to restructure library education in the 21st century, focusing on changes in curricula, faculty, and diversity in library education. Gorman believes that students are too focused on learning without goals in mind and that educators are too inclined to change everything just because the internet and all its resources has arrived and that instead, it should be used as an accompaniment to existing educational methods.\n\nSince his first book (with Walt Crawford), Gorman has stressed the importance of the book in the place of the library and Gorman has suggested that only books can bestow true knowledge on the reader. He emphasises the importance of the book throughout his works. He has expressed concern at the way research has become simply typing a few works in a search engine and says that serious research is impossible to carry out using this method without the additional reading of books.\n\nMichael Gorman presented ‘’Our Enduring Values’’ to the Association of Christian Libraries (ACL) and further reviews of his book have suggested that the eight proposed values which librarians should follow are more closely related to biblical theism than the humanistic beliefs Gorman believes. Further work by the ACL has developed ideas relating to the formulation of a Christian approach to library values.\n\nIn Gorman's publications, he focuses on the importance on the preserving of information and knowledge and the importance of the librarian in helping to achieve this. In Gorman's eight values, he stresses the importance of a librarian having strong values and an ethical stance because these will help the librarian in their job. Failure is bearable because the decisions that caused that failure are based on a person's own beliefs and a person secure in their values is more likely to have higher self-esteem. The importance of librarians reflecting on their own decisions and responsibilities can be seen in \"Our Singular Strengths\" and \"Our Own Selves\" which feature meditations for librarians, which librarians can use to reaffirm their own profession.\n\nGorman has written extensively about librarianship and issues in library science in the professional and academic press, as well as editing and authoring several books, including:\nSince 2008, Gorman has written articles on English for the now defunct Vocabula Review and essays on Dickens, paratext, P.G.Wodehouse, and James Joyce for The Caxtonian, the magazine of the Caxton Club.\n\n\n\n\n \n"}

Genetic evidence has been interpreted to suggest the two species diverged only around 400,000 years ago, although the most recent evidence indicates the split was closer to 6 million years.\n\nPale-throated sloths have a rounded head with a blunt nose and small external ears. The limbs are long and weak, with the arms being nearly twice the length of the hindlimbs. The hands and feet each have three digits, armed with long, arched claws, with the middle claw being the largest and most powerful. Males are in head-body length, with a short, , tail, and weigh from . However, the females are noticeably larger, being from in length, and weighing .\n\nThe body is covered with coarse guard hairs up to long, with a finer undercoat. Green algae live mutualistically between the microscopic scales on the surface of the guard hairs, giving the sloth a somewhat greenish appearance that serves as camouflage. Adults are blackish-grey over most of the body, with darker patches distributed over the backs, shoulders, and hips. Males have a bright yellow or orange patch on the back, divided by a central black stripe. Pale-throated sloths are difficult to distinguish from the closely related brown-throated sloth, but, as their name implies, have a pale yellow patch on the throat.\n\nThe eyes are large and forward facing for binocular vision, with round pupils. Unusually, they appear to lack any cone cells in the retina, suggesting that the sloth is unable to see color. Despite its apparently small ears, the pale-throated sloth has excellent hearing; it has also been reported to have a good sense of smell.\n\nThe sloth has nine cervical vertebrae, giving it extreme flexibility. As a result, a pale-throated sloth can bend its head backwards and forwards through 270° and rotate it through 330°. It possesses a pair of foramina in the anterodorsal nasopharynx, a feature that distinguishes it from its sister species. The females have two mammae in the chest region, a simple uterus. Males have no discrete prostate gland, no scrotum, and only rudimentary seminal vesicles.\n\nThe mouth is lined by a black colored mucosa, although the large and heavy tongue is pink. The palate is wrinkled in texture, and the tongue is lined with numerous grooves, apparently adaptations to the sloth's diet. Like other three-toed sloths, it has just five teeth on each side of the upper jaw, and four on each side of the lower jaw; these are all simple and rounded in shape, with the front teeth in the upper jaw being much smaller than the others. The esophagus is short, but the stomach is large and complex, and there is also a large diverticulum in the cecum.\n\nThe pale-throated sloth is found only in the tropical forests of northern South America, including Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, eastern Venezuela and Brazil north of the Amazon River. There are no recognised subspecies.\n\nPale-throated sloths are solitary, herbivorous animals that spend almost their entire lives in trees. Depending on habitat, population densities of anything from have been reported. They eat only leaves, twigs, and buds of the trees of \"Cecropia\", \"Ceiba\", \"Elizabetha\", and \"Hevea\". Known predators include jaguars, margays, harpy eagles, and anacondas.\n\nThe pale-throated sloth can hang so securely with its hooklike claws that it even falls asleep in this position. It may even stay suspended in the trees for some time after it dies. They have been reported to spend over eighteen hours each day asleep, and move through the tree canopy only very slowly. They periodically descend from the trees to defecate, depositing a pile of small pellets in a hole dug into the ground. Despite their arboreal lifestyle, they are effective swimmers. Their call is a bird-like whistle described as an \"ai-ai\" sound.\n\nIn addition to their mutualism with green algae, pale-throated sloths are also commensal with sloth moths, and with certain species of beetle. These insects live in the sloth's fur, and lay their eggs in its dung, on which their larvae feed.\n\nMating takes place in the trees, with the pair either face to face, or with the male on the female's back. The female gives birth to a single infant after a gestation period of about six months.\n\nThe young are born already fully furred, and with open eyes. The young animal clings to the mother's underside for the first month of life, by which time it has reached a weight of around . They begin to take solid food at three weeks, and are fully weaned some time after the first month. The young initially have soft greyish-brown fur, which darkens and becomes rougher as they age. They reach sexual maturity at around three years.\n\n"}

During his predecessors reigns, he was a viceroy in Jazira.\n\nHe was considered as one of candidates to Ilkhanid throne after death of Arghun. Nobles like Taghachar, Qoncuqbal, Toghan and Tuqal supported Baydu, however he refused throne stating throne belongs to the brother or a son according to yassa, while Mahmud Aqsarai simply states that when Baydu didn't appear at the \"quriltai\", Gaykhatu was enthroned instead. Baydu stood stationed in Baghdad and even travelled to coronation feast of new khan Gaykhatu. However, after getting drunk Gaykhatu insulted Baydu telling one of his servants to hit Baydu. This grew a resentment in Baydu towards him. Baydu left hastily towards to his appanage near Baghdad leaving his son Qipchak as a hostage in Gaykhatu's court. He was supported by Oirat emir Chichak (son of Sulaimish b. Tengiz Güregen), Lagzi Küregen (son of Arghun Aqa), El-Temur (son of Hinduqur Noyan) and Todachu Yarquchi, who followed him to Baghdad. He was also aided by his vizier Jamal ud-Din Dastgerdani. According to Hamdullah Qazwini, Baydu's main motivation on moving against Gaykhatu was his sexual advances against Qipchak.\n\nWhen son-in-law Ghurbatai Güregen brought him news of treachery, Gaykhatu ordered arrest of several amirs including his personal \"keshig\" Tuladai, Qoncuqbal, Tukal, Bughdai, including Kipchak and put into jail in Tabriz. While his followers Hasan and Taiju demanded their executions, Taghachar advised against it. Baydu on his side, moved to kill Muhammad Sugurchi, governor of Baghdad and arrested governor Baybuqa of Diyar Bakr. Gaykhatu sent his father-in-law Aq Buqa and Taghachar against Baydu on 17 March 1295, himself arriving at Tabriz 4 days later. Little he knew that Taghachar already shifted allegiance to Baydu who left for his encampment at night. While he wanted to flee to Anatolia, his councillors advised to fight against Baydu. Nevertheless, Gaykhatu fled to Mughan. Arriving in Tabriz, Taghachar set Qoncuqbal and Tuladai free, while Gaikhatu desperately begged for mercy. Despite his appeal, he was strangled by a bowstring so as to avoid bloodshed on 21 March 1295. However, some sources put this event on 5 March or 25 April.\n\nBaydu was considered easygoing and controllable, and under him, the Ilkhanate was divided among the co-conspirators. However, Gaykhatu's death wasn't without consequences, especially Prince Ghazan in Khorasan grew restless. Baydu explained the fact that Ghazan was away during events leading to Gaykhatu's fall, therefore nobles had no choice but to raise him to throne. Nevertheless, Amir Nowruz encouraged Ghazan to take steps against Baydu, because he was nothing but a figurehead under grips of nobles. Mar Yahballaha III also noted Baydu being a weak khan. Conspirators divided the empire between themselves: Taghachar took governorate of Anatolia, Tuladai gained Persian Iraq and Lorestan, while Qoncoqbal took Shiraz and Shabankara to himself Tukal went back to his ancestral lands in Georgia. Meanwhile, his mother-in-law Kurdujin Khatun was installed as governor of Kerman and had Padishah Khatun executed. Aq Buqa Jalair, chief commander of Gaykhatu was also killed on demands of Qoncuqbal.\n\nGhazan started to move against Baydu towards his headquarters in Azerbaijan. Baydu's forces commanded by Ildar Oghul (his cousin and Prince Ajay's son) met him near Qazvin. First battle was won by Ghazan but he had to fall back after realising Ildar's contingent was just a fraction of whole army, leaving Nowruz behind. After a short truce, Baydu offered Ghazan co-ruling of ilkhanate and Nowruz the post of sahib-i divan to which as a counter-condition Ghazan demanded the revenues of his father's hereditary lands in Fars, Persian Iraq and Kerman. Nowruz denied conditions, which led to its arrest. According to an anecdote, he promised to bring Ghazan back tied-up on condition of his release. Once he reached Ghazan, he sent back a cauldron to Baydu; a word play on the Turkish word .\n\nAmir Nowruz promised him the throne and his help on a condition of Ghazan's conversion to Islam. Nowruz entered Qazvin with 4000 soldiers and claimed an additional number of 120.000 on his way towards Azerbaijan which caused panic among masses which was followed by defections of Taghachar's subordinates and other powerful emirs like Qurumishi and Chupan. Seeing imminent defeat, Baydu fled to Tukal in Georgia. Baydu attempted to escape and flee from Azerbaijan to Georgia, but was taken prisoner near Nakhichevan he was taken to Tabriz and executed on the 5 October 1295, ending the civil war with his successor. Relatives, including his son Qipchaq (d. 26 September 1295) and Ildar Oghul were also executed.\n\nBaydu had strong sympathies to Christianity, but was required to act outwardly as a Muslim. Some sources state he didn't act even as Muslim. According to Saunders in \"Mongol Conquests\", Baydu allowed churches on his \"ordo\" and wore a cross around his neck. He was urged by his followers to rid himself of Ghazan, the son of Arghun Khan, but refused out of affection.\nBaydu had three consorts, two of them from Qutlugkhanid dynasty:\n\n\n"}

After Noriega placed him under house arrest, Colonel Díaz received significant support from the Panamanian people, with many passing by his house in cars to shake his hand. He was imprisoned shortly thereafter and eventually given political asylum in Venezuela. After spending 11 years of exile in various Latin American countries, Díaz returned to Panama. Diaz Herrera also ran for the presidency with a minor political party, PNP, from 1996 to 1998, but lost to a larger political party. In 2004, he was chosen by the newly elected Panamanian president, Martín Torrijos, to be the country's ambassador to Peru.\n\nBorn on June 27, 1938 as the seventh of nine siblings in Santiago, the capital city of the Panamanian province of Veraguas, Roberto Díaz was raised by his parents, Anastacio Díaz Jiménez, a teacher, and Gregoria Herrera, who worked as a housewife and sold bread and desserts at a local store. Gregoria was the sister of General Omar Torrijos Herrera’s mother. \n\nAt age 15, he studied in Lima, Peru, at the Military School of Leoncio Prado, while also attending classes at the Escuela de Oficiales de la Guardia Civil (Official School of the Civil Guard). Additionally, he studied at the ULACIT in Panama, where he earned a law degree.\n\nDíaz Herrera married his first wife, Raquel Judith Tapiero, on October 7, 1962. They had four children: Judith Gregoria, Gaby I Sol, Raquel Diaz, and Roberto Jr. They later divorced. \n\nBeginning with a rank of second lieutenant, Díaz pursued a military career in the only institution of its kind in Panama, the Guardia Nacional de Panamá (National Guard of Panama). He rose quickly to colonel. \n\nOn September 7, 1977, US President Jimmy Carter and Panamanian leader Omar Torrijos signed the Torrijos-Carter Treaties. Torrijos sent Díaz Herrera as a negotiator of the Panama Canal to many countries, including Cuba, France, and Yugoslavia. He also served as a political representative in Israel, Algeria, Venezuela, Mexico, and Costa Rica.\n\nDíaz became General Chief of Staff to the military, which had been renamed the Fuerzas de Defensa de Panamá (Panama Defense Forces). At that time, he was second in command of Panama's military under the command of Manuel Noriega.\n\nIn June 1987, Diaz Herrera was forcibly retired by Noriega, who it was rumored felt threatened by Diaz who had grown in influence and respect within the Panamanian Defense Forces (FDP). Noriega justified the move based on the age of Colonel Diaz Herrera who turned 50 years old that month. Following his forced retirement, in an interview with Panama's leading opposition newspaper, \"La Prensa\", Colonel Díaz made a strong declaration against Noriega. He accused Noriega of drug trafficking; of planning the assassination of his predecessor Omar Torrijos Herrera who negotiated the return of the Panama Canal with Jimmy Carter (Torrijos was Diaz Herrera's own cousin, and claimed Noriega had planted an explosive in the private aircraft of Torrijos with the help of the CIA); of ordering the killing of Hugo Spadafora, Diaz Herrera's personal friend; and of orchestrating fraud in the 1984 presidential election. These allegations led many people in Panama to protest, resulting in a suspension of constitutional protections and austere measure by the Noriega regime including arrest and detainment of protestors and opposition party leaders, government seizure of local television stations, and tear gassing of students and accused brutality of local citizens with batons, rubber hoses filled with sand, and shotguns filled with rock salt.\n\nJust 50 days after the televised interview, Noriega placed Díaz under house arrest. During that time many people went to Díaz's house to shake his hand in order to show their support for him. The street to his house was frequently lined with the cars of his supporters. Later, the whole Spadafora family would go into hiding at Díaz Herrera's residency, which served as a refuge against Noriega's loyal soldiers, who finally raided the residence on July 27, 1987 to place him in prison. The raid was accomplished with three helicopters and over 100 heavily armed men in an assault orchestrated by Mike Harari, Noriega's personal friend and former Israeli intelligence officer. The raid ended when Díaz Herrera, who kept more than 30 of his loyal officers in the residence at the time, surrendered and was taken into custody. The invasion of the personal home compound of Diaz occurred at between 6:30 and 8 a.m. with military helicopters initially circling the barb wired walls, firing automatic weapons into the home and compound. Tear gas and light armored vehicles were used to breach the walls and raid the compound, with at least one explosive round being used to breach the front gate. While the Panamanian government claimed no one was killed in the raid, local residents reported several badly wounded bodies being removed in the hours after the attack. One body guard of Diaz Herrera was reportedly killed. Blood trails could be easily seen from the heavily damaged front entrance used to enter the compound. During the raid, Díaz Herrera's second wife, Claret Maigualida, and their small children were in the residence.\n\nAfter spending six months in jail, Díaz was exiled on December 24, after several countries negotiated his release from prison. He was sent to Venezuela where wife Maigualida and their three children awaited.\n\nAt the beginning of his exile from Panama, Díaz spent about six years in Caracas, Venezuela, during the presidency of Carlos Andres Perez, a personal friend who granted him political asylum. Caracas was also the birthplace of his second wife, Claret Maigualida, with whom he would spend the rest of his life. Later, he spent time in Argentina, travelled throughout Europe, and finally arrived in Ecuador with Maigualida and his children, Daniel Roberto Díaz Herrera, Carlos Guillermo Díaz Herrera (who is currently participating in politics) and Romai Anastacia Díaz de Homes.\n\nIn 2004, Martín Torrijos, the son of Omar and a second nephew of Roberto Díaz, was elected president of Panama and chose Díaz to serve as ambassador to Peru.\n\nDíaz was the Ambassador of Panama and Consul of Callao in Perú until 2009.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1983473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1983473", "title": "Flat-field correction", "text": "Flat-field correction\n\nFlat-field correction is a technique used to improve quality in digital imaging. It cancels the effects of image artifacts caused by variations in the pixel-to-pixel sensitivity of the detector and by distortions in the optical path. It is a standard calibration procedure in everything from personal digital cameras to large telescopes.\n\nFlat fielding refers to the process of compensating for different gains and dark currents in a detector. Once a detector has been appropriately flat-fielded, a uniform signal will create a uniform output (hence flat-field). This then means any further signal is due to the phenomenon being detected and not a systematic error.\n\nA flat-field image is acquired by imaging a uniformly-illuminated screen, thus producing an image of uniform color and brightness across the frame. For handheld cameras, the screen could be a piece of paper at arm's length, but a telescope will frequently image a clear patch of sky at twilight, when the illumination is uniform and there are few, if any, stars visible. Once the images are acquired, processing can begin.\n\nA flat-field consists of two numbers for each pixel, the pixel's gain and its dark current (or dark frame). The pixel's gain is how the amount of signal given by the detector varies as a function of the amount of light (or equivalent). The gain is almost always a linear variable, as such the gain is given simply as the ratio of the input and output signals. The dark-current is the amount of signal given out by the detector when there is no incident light (hence dark frame). In many detectors this can also be a function of time, for example in astronomical telescopes it is common to take a dark-frame of the same time as the planned light exposure. The gain and dark-frame for optical systems can also be established by using a series of neutral density filters to give input/output signal information and applying a least squares fit to obtain the values for the dark current and gain.\nformula_1\n\nwhere:\n\n\nIn this equation, capital letters are 2D matrices, and lowercase letters are scalars. All matrix operations are performed element-by-element.\n\nIn order for an astrophotographer to capture a light frame, he or she must place a light source over the imaging instrument's objective lens such that the light source emanates evenly through the users optics. The photographer must then adjust the exposure of their imaging device (CCD or DSLR camera) so that when the histogram of the image is viewed, a peak reaching about 40–70% of the dynamic range (maximum range of pixel values) of the imaging device is seen. The photographer typically takes 15–20 light frames and performs median stacking. Once the desired light frames are acquired, the objective lens is covered so that no light is allowed in, then 15–20 dark frames are taken, each of equal exposure time as a light frame. These are called Dark-Flat frames.\n\nIn X-ray imaging, the acquired projection images generally suffer from fixed-pattern noise, which is one of the limiting factors of image quality. It may stem from beam inhomogeneity, gain variations of the detector response due to inhomogeneities in the photon conversion yield, losses in charge transport, charge trapping, or variations in the performance of the readout. Also, the scintillator screen may accumulate dust and/or scratches on its surface, resulting in systematic patterns in every acquired X-ray projection image. In X-ray Computed Tomography (CT), fixed-pattern noise is known to significantly degrade the achievable spatial resolution and generally leads to ring or band artifacts in the reconstructed images. Fixed pattern noise can be easily removed using flat field correction. In conventional flat field correction, projection images without sample are acquired with and without the X-ray beam turned on, which are referred to as flat fields (F) and dark fields (D). Based on the acquired flat and dark fields, the measured projection images (P) with sample are then normalized to new images (N) according to \n\nformula_3\n\nWhile conventional flat field correction is an elegant and easy procedure that largely reduces fixed-pattern noise, it heavily relies on the stationarity of the X-ray beam, scintillator response and CCD sensitivity. In practice, however, this assumption is only approximately met. Indeed, detector elements are characterized by intensity dependent, nonlinear response functions and the incident beam often shows time dependent non-uniformities, which render conventional FFC inadequate. In synchrotron X-ray tomography, many factors may cause flat field variations: instability of the bending magnets of the synchrotron, temperature variations due to the water cooling in mirrors and the monochromator, or vibrations of the scintillator and other beamline components. The latter is responsible for the biggest variations in the flat fields. To deal with such variations, a dynamic flat field correction procedure can be employed that estimates a flat field for each individual projection. Through principal component analysis of a set of flat fields, which are acquired prior and/or posterior to the actual scan, eigen flat fields can be computed. A linear combination of the most important eigen flat fields can then be used to individually normalize each X-ray projection:\n\nformula_4\n\n\n\n\n"}

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 10, 2002. In the episode, Homer's snoring interferes with Marge's sleep. To earn money to cure Homer's snoring, Marge agrees to spend a weekend with Artie Ziff if he vows to not grope her as he did during their high-school prom date (\"The Way We Was\"). While spying on Marge and Artie, Homer mistakenly thinks they are making out, so he leaves with Lenny to work on an oil rig.\n\nAlthough the episode was written by Tim Long, the idea for the episode was pitched by series' co-creator and executive producer James L. Brooks. The episode was directed by Lauren MacMullan, who ordered several complicated sequences from the animators, leading to some tensions among \"The Simpsons\" staff. The episode's plot and title is based on the 1993 film \"Indecent Proposal\", and the episode also features references to \"M*A*S*H\", \"Midnight Cowboy\" and \"Five Easy Pieces\". The episode features Jon Lovitz as Artie Ziff, the first time he portrayed Ziff since the season 2 episode \"The Way We Was\".\n\nIn its original broadcast, the episode was seen by approximately 7.5 million viewers and finished in 36th place in the ratings the week it aired. \n\nSince its original broadcast, \"Half-Decent Proposal\" has received mostly positive reviews from critics, some of whom considered it among the best episodes of the season. However, the episode has also been criticized for parodying \"Indecent Proposal\" nine years after its release, a criticism that the episode's showrunner Al Jean responded to in the episode's DVD commentary.\n\nMarge grows irritated when Homer's loud snoring keeps her awake at night. Dr. Hibbert recommends an expensive surgery to correct the problem, but balks when Homer asks him to do it for free. While spending the night with Patty and Selma to get some sleep, Marge hears a news report that her old high school boyfriend, Artie Ziff, is now the fifth-richest man in the United States. She drunkenly dictates an e-mail to Artie to congratulate him on his success, but Patty and Selma turn it into a sexually provocative message, to Marge's horror.\n\nArtie, who has been deeply obsessed with Marge since high school, flies to Springfield and makes the Simpsons an offer: $1 million to spend a weekend with Marge to show her what life would be like if they were married. Eventually Marge accepts the offer to cure Homer's snoring. At first she enjoys Artie's company, but during a re-enactment of their high school prom, he tricks her into making out against her will. While trying to sneak into the prom, Homer sees them kissing and is devastated, not knowing the exact circumstances. A furious Marge leaves Artie and returns home to find Homer gone and a taped message saying he has left Springfield with Lenny — similarly despondent over his relationship with Carl — to work at an oil field.\n\nWhile working on an oil rig in West Springfield, Homer and Lenny accidentally set fire to an ant. The flames quickly spread and set the entire rig ablaze, endangering both men's lives. Bart tracks down Homer's location, worrying the entire family because West Springfield is a death trap. Marge puts aside her anger with Artie and calls him for help. He picks her up in his private helicopter and flies to West Springfield to save Homer and Lenny. At first they are reluctant to accept his help, but Artie admits defeat and tells Homer he could never win Marge's love, even with his fortune. Lenny is surprised to see Carl is also aboard the helicopter. He and Homer are saved just before the rig collapses.\n\nInstead of paying the Simpsons $1 million, Artie gives Homer a device that converts his snoring to soothing music. The device also allows Artie to watch Marge through a hidden camera and deliver subliminal messages to persuade her to leave Homer.\n\n\"Half-Decent Proposal\" was written by consulting producer Tim Long and directed by Lauren MacMullan. Serving as assistant director for MacMullan was Raymond Persi, who later became, according to current show-runner Al Jean, one of the series' \"best regular directors\". The episode was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on February 10, 2002. The idea for the episode was pitched by James L. Brooks, who is one of the series' co-creators and executive producers. He suggested an episode in which Artie Ziff returns and offers Homer a million dollars in exchange for spending a weekend with Marge, trying to convince her to divorce Homer. He also wanted the episode to parody the film \"Indecent Proposal\". Ziff's wealth had been established in the season 4 episode \"The Front\", in which it was revealed that he had become \"stinking rich\". The setpiece of \"Half-Decent Proposal\", in which Homer's snoring is keeping Marge awake during the night, was pitched by Long's ex-girlfriend. Originally, at one point in the episode, there would be a sequence in which Homer travels to Silicon Valley in the wheel well of a jet. The sequence was based on a news story that the \"Simpsons\" writers were \"really obsessed with\". The episode was one of the first to suggest that Lenny and Carl have an intimate relationship. This revelation garnered scrutiny from the series' fans, who, according to Jean, were \"very angry\" over it.\n\n\"Half-Decent Proposal\" was animated in a very complicated manner. In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, director MacMullan stated that a couple of sequences in the episode were \"reaching too far\" for the animation process to be \"reassembled correctly\". One example, she mentioned, is the scene in which Marge remembers Ziff's assault from \"The Way We Was\". Ziff's assault is shown as hands reaching for Marge, and was put together by MacMullan in post-production. Right after Marge's sisters Patty and Selma send an e-mail to Ziff, the e-mail's path is elaborately shown through a \"trip through the computer wires\". MacMullan stated that, even though she found the scene \"illogical\", she maintained that it was \"done with great effort\". Because the characters at Ziff's prom had to wear 1970s styled wardrobe, the animators had to come up with new designs for the character's clothes. Several of the designs were pitched and drawn by Ron Hauge, a former \"Simpsons\" writer who was responsible for coordinating character designs on the series for many years. The dance that Ziff performs at the prom was pitched by MacMullan, and the prom locale was drawn using a photo reference. A scene in the episode shows Homer and Lenny signing on to become oil workers. The manager who hands them a paper clip can be seen smoking, and originally, MacMullan suggested that the manager \"puts his lit cigarette out in the [oil] can [next to him], and blows his other arm off.\" She pitched the idea to Jean, who responded by writing \"I wouldn't.\" The episode's complicated and lengthy animation process was so strenuous that it led the \"Simpsons\" animators to start calling MacMullan \"Lauren MacMultiplane\".\n\n\"Half-Decent Proposal\" features the return of Artie Ziff, and the first time since the season 2 episode \"The Way We Was\" that he was portrayed by American comedian Jon Lovitz. Even though Ziff appeared in the season 4 episode \"The Front\" as well, Lovitz was not available during the episode's recording session, and the character was instead voiced by Dan Castellaneta, who is one of the series' main cast members. Jean stated that Lovitz, who has voiced a variety of characters on \"The Simpsons\" before, is one of the staff's \"favorite guest-stars\". The episode also features the first and only appearance of Baron von Kissalot. In the episode, Marge is charged $912 for a taxi drive back to Springfield. She sarcastically tells the taxi driver to send the bill to \"Baron von Kissalot\", who turns out to be a real person. The character, which was pitched by former show runner David Mirkin and portrayed by Castellaneta, has become one of the writers' favorites and was series animation director Jim Reardon's favorite joke of the entire season. Castellaneta also voiced a couple of the ants who are put on fire at the oil tower. The \"Simpsons\" staff debated whether the ants would speak or make any sound at all, with series co-creator Matt Groening being notably hesitant to them being voiced.\n\nThe title, as well as the episode's premise, is based on the 1993 drama film \"Indecent Proposal\" and follows the story of the film loosely. The channel BHO is a reference to the real-life television network HBO. Moe's line \"He [Artie Ziff] is like a spy in the house Moe\" is based on the Anaïs Nin novel \"A Spy in the House of Love\". The ball in Ziff's manor points back to a scene in the season 2 episode \"The Way We Was\", in which Marge danced with Ziff. Believing that Marge and Ziff will get married, Homer says that he'll \"never be born\" as a result, a similar problem faced by Marty McFly in \"Back to the Future\". Comic Book Guy has several items of merchandise from the \"Star Wars\" franchise in his room, including sheets, pictures and a Jar Jar Binks doll.\n\nDuring breakfast after Marge has had a sleepless night, she serves a stack of pancakes to Lisa who pulls out of the stack a syrup covered copy of Time Magazine with \"AOL Rules\" on the front cover - a reference to the ill-fated AOL-Time Warner merger that had happened the year before. \"Nookie in New York\", the TV show that Marge watches with her sisters, spoofs the TV series \"Sex and the City\". When Marge leaves with Artie, she sees that Homer has spelled the words \"Keep Your Clothes On\" as a direct reference to the M*A*S*H series finale, Goodbye, Farewell and Amen. In the video that Homer recorded for Marge, Homer holds two toys. The one in his left hand is a \"Funzo\", a fictional toy that first appeared in the season 11 episode \"Grift of the Magi\". The fictional area of \"West Springfield\" is modeled after the American state Texas (purposely once again a red-herring to where Springfield is based - it seems to be right next to Texas, until Lisa states that West Springfield is \"Three times the size of Texas\"). The scene in which Homer and Lenny are travelling to West Springfield is a reference to the last scene in the 1969 drama film \"Midnight Cowboy\". The music heard during the scene is also made to resemble the theme from said film. The scene in which Homer and Lenny are working in an oil rig is a reference to the 1970 film \"Five Easy Pieces\". The song produced by Artie's invention at the end of the episode is \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)\", originally by \"Eurythmics\".\n\nIn its original American broadcast on February 10, 2002, \"Half-Decent Proposal\" received a 7.1 rating, according to Nielsen Media Research, translating to approximately 7.5 million viewers. The episode finished in 36th place in the ratings for the week of February 4–10, 2002. On August 24, 2010, the episode was released part of \"The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season\" DVD and Blu-ray set. Al Jean, Ian Maxtone-Graham, Matt Selman, Tim Long, Dan Castellaneta, Lauren MacMullan, Matt Warburton and James Lipton participated in the audio commentary of the episode.\n\nSix years after the episode's original broadcast, Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a 9/10, describing it as \"amazing\". He especially liked Lovitz' performance Artie Ziff, calling it \"pitch-perfect\" and that one of his favourite lines \"stands out\" because of Lovitz's \"great delivery\". Canning also enjoyed the prom scene as well as Lenny and Carl's implied intimate relationship, which he described as \"a completely unexpected treat\". He summarized the episode as \"top-notch\" and wrote \"The writing was smart and tight, and instead of a B storyline, the half-hour was filled out with a number of great throwaway gags [...] It's true we may have never expected to see Artie Ziff again, but \"Half-Decent Proposal\" was a welcome and very funny return.\"\n\nIn January 2010, following the conclusion of \"The Simpsons\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s twentieth season, IGN chose \"Half-Decent Proposal\" as the best episode from the thirteenth season, and following the thirteenth season's home video release, reviewer R.L. Shaffer called it one of the season's \"gems [...] with good reason\". \n\nBoth Michael Hikcerson of Slice of SciFi and Rosie Fletcher of Total Film considered \"Half-Decent Proposal\" to be one of the season's best episodes, with Fletcher calling it a \"stand-out\".\n\nCasey Broadwater of Blu-ray.com gave it a positive review as well, describing it as a \"strong character-centric episode\".\n\nHowever, giving the episode a mixed review, Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide called it \"mediocre\". Although he praised Lovitz' return as Ziff, and though he did not consider it to be one of the season's worst episodes, Jacobson criticized it for not \"hav[ing] a lot of zing\". \n\nRon Martin of 411Mania wrote a negative review, calling it a \"yearly episode just with different tempters each time\". \n\nAdam Rayner of Obsessed with Film criticized the episode's references to \"Indecent Proposal\", calling it a \"rip-off\" of the film. Furthermore, he wrote that the episode \"manages to be worse [than] that dire movie [\"Indecent Proposal\"].\" \n\nNate Boss of Project-Blu also criticized the episode's similarity to \"Indecent Proposal\", calling it \"late to the party\". He wrote: \"Like South Park imitating the WWE in its 13th year, about 12 years past when it hit its prime, \"The Simpsons\" makes an \"Indecent Proposal\" themed episode.\" Boss also described the episode as \"played out,\" and criticized it for having \"unfunny characters (Artie Ziff), who appear far more often than they should.\" \n\nIn the DVD commentary for the episode, Jean defended \"The Simpsons\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> writers' choice to base the episode's story on \"Indecent Proposal\", eight years after the movie was released. He argued that rather than lampooning a current film that will get parodied on other television shows anyway, it is more \"interesting\" to make an episode based on a story that \"people may not be familiar with\".\n\n"}

Students are between 15 and 19 years old, and the majority receive full or partial scholarships. They are selected from 155 National Committees that represent the United World Colleges around the globe.\n\nIn late 2007, \"The Wall Street Journal\" identified UWC-USA as one of the world's top 20 schools for its success in preparing students to enter top American universities. In 2010, UWC-USA was ranked a “Top Ten Program” by U.S. Center for Citizen Diplomacy.\n\nThe Armand Hammer Foundation purchased the property to establish a United World College in the United States in 1981. Major renovations of existing buildings preceded the school's opening in the fall of 1982, an event that was attended by HRH Prince Charles, president of the United World Colleges movement. The school's founding president was Theodore D. Lockwood, who served from 1982 until 1993. Philip O. Geier served as president from 1993 until 2005, when he passed the reins to Lisa A. H. Darling, whose presidency ended in 2013. The school's fourth president was Dr. Mukul Kumar '89, an alumnus and leader in international education, who left the school in 2016. The school is currently led by Dr. Victoria Mora, former Dean of the Santa Fe campus of St. John's College.\n\nIn 1998, the school's endowment was significantly increased through the generosity of investment manager Shelby M.C. Davis and his wife Gale. Their gift today secures the largest block of the school's student scholarships and makes this school (and all the other UWCs) 100% free for all American students. Their initial gift of $45 million in 1998 was, at the time, the largest private donation ever made to international education.\n\nThe school, in the foothills of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, is located at in the town of Montezuma, New Mexico, just northwest of the city of Las Vegas, New Mexico, about from Santa Fe.\n\nThe campus includes the historic Montezuma Castle.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1983488", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1983488", "title": "Mitsubishi Pajero", "text": "Mitsubishi Pajero\n\nThe is a full-size sport utility vehicle manufactured and marketed globally by Mitsubishi.\n\nMitsubishi markets the SUV as the Montero in Spain and the Americas (except for Brazil and Jamaica) and as the Shogun in the United Kingdom. However, the Montero is no longer sold in North America as of late 2006. The \"Pajero\" nameplate derives from \"Leopardus pajeros\", the Pampas cat.\n\nThe Pajero has earned a respected legacy in rally and are particularly noted for having won the Dakar Rally 12 times, having the highest number of Dakar Rally stage wins (nearly twice that of the nearest competitor) and seizing 80% of Dakar Rally podium finishes from 2001-2005. Records for which Mitsubishi earned a place in the Guinness World Records and are currently unbeaten.\n\nDue to their success, the Pajero, Montero and Shogun names were also applied to other, mechanically unrelated models, such as the Pajero Mini kei car, the Pajero Junior and Pajero iO/Pinin mini SUVs, and the Pajero/Montero/Shogun Sport mid-size SUVs. The Pajero is one of three models by Mitsubishi (the others being the Mitsubishi Triton and Mitsubishi Pajero Sport) that share Mitsubishi's heavy-duty, off-road-orientated Super-Select four-wheel-drive system as opposed to their light-duty Mitsubishi S-AWC all-wheel-drive system.\n\nThe roots of the Pajero can be traced back to 1934 with the Mitsubishi PX33 prototype commissioned for the Japanese Government. Mitsubishi presented the first Pajero prototype at the Tokyo Motor Show in November 1973 then Pajero II prototype followed in 1978, five years later.\n\nIn January 1983, the first Pajero debuted at the Paris Dakar Rally, taking first place in 1985 at only the third attempt. Other wins followed, at events such as the Australasian Safari and Northern Forest.\n\nA Mitsubishi Pajero, driven by Andrew Cowan, finished the 1984 Paris–Alger–Dakar as the third ranked winner in overall class after covering more than 11,000 km. Mitsubishi dominated with multiple first, second and third place podium finishes until their final wins in 2007. From 2001-2005, with the introduction of their third generation Pajero with monocoque chassis and fully independent suspension, Mitsubishi had 5 consecutive first-place finishes and 12 of all 15 podium finishes in the same time period. Their overall record was 12 total overall wins (1st place) in the \"Cars Class\" and 150 stage wins (the second best being Peugeot with only 78 stage wins in comparison). Mitsubishi earned the title of ‘Most Dakar Rally Wins by A Manufacturer’ from the Guinness World Records.\nThe first generation made its debut at the Tokyo Motor Show in October 1981, and was launched in May 1982. Initially, it was a three-door, short-wheelbase model available with a metal or canvas top and three different engines options, although more were gradually added, ending with a 3.0-litre V6 on top of the range.\n\nIt included features unusual for a four-wheel-drive vehicle: a turbocharged diesel engine, a front double wishbone suspension with torsion bar springs, power steering and suspension seats.\n\nIn January 1983, only a year following its launch, mildly tuned production Pajeros entered the world of motor sport.\n\nIn February 1983, Mitsubishi introduced a long-wheelbase, five-door model, available with a choice of two different engines; a 2.0-litre turbocharged petrol (badged as \"2.0 Turbo\" and \"2000 Turbo\" in some markets) and a 2.3-litre turbocharged diesel. It also came in Standard, Semi-High Roof and High Roof body styles. Outside of Japan there was also the 2.6-liter petrol four, which produced in European trim.\n\nThe long-wheelbase model increased seating capacity to seven, with available third row seats, which could be folded to the sides for additional trunk space or combined with second row seats to form a bed.\n\nIn 1984, the Pajero received turbo diesel engines with higher power/torque ratings, whilst the long-wheelbase models received standard four-wheel disc brakes and four-way adjustable shock absorbers as standard equipment.\nA flagship model was introduced in 1987 with two-tone paint, 15-inch light alloy wheels, front-seat heaters, wool seat covers, leather headrests, a three-spoke steering wheel and a sound system with radio/cassette. In 1987, a version of the Pajero/Montero was rebadged by Dodge as the Raider, which ran through 1989.\n\nIn 1988, a 3.0-litre SOHC V6 engine was made available, alongside a 2.5-litre turbo diesel engine, with the first 4x4 intercooler. The long-wheelbase models received a coil link suspension system for better ride comfort and off-road ability.\n\nIt was available with a 3-door body for a short wheelbase \"(SWB)\" or a 5-door body for a long-wheelbase \"(LWB)\". Engines included a 2.6 L I4 with , a 3.0 L V6 with EFI and and a turbocharged 2.5 L OHC diesel I4 with or an intercooled . Part-time four-wheel drive was standard on all models.\n\nThe first generation platform was later built under license by Hyundai Precision Products as the Hyundai Galloper from 1991 to 2003, and exported to Europe for a brief time. While it used first generation mechanicals, the Galloper's body was closer to the second generation Pajeros.\n\nThe NA series was released to Australia during January 1983 in short- (SWB) and long-wheelbase (LWB) three-door wagon formats, with the 2.6-litre petrol or 2.3-litre turbo diesel, both mated to a five-speed \"KM145\" manual transmission. Brakes were ventilated front discs and rear drums. The five-door, high-roof LWB model was introduced in May 1984 with the same powertrain options. The five-door offered a luxury Superwagon trim and also had a shorter final drive than the SWB models, to make up for the increased weight.\n\nThe NB of November 1984 included a revised grille, deleted the LWB three-door body style and the diesel engine for the remaining SWB three-door. Mitsubishi Australia released the NC series in November 1985, introducing optional power steering, while the long-wheelbase five-door switched to a low-roofed design.\n\nA \"KM148\" automatic gearbox became optional on the petrol Superwagon for the October 1986 ND update, while the 2.5-litre turbo diesel replaced the old 2.3-litre unit. For the October 1987 NE series, the Japanese 2.6-litre petrol was replaced with the Australian-made \"Astron II\" version. Brake dimensions were also increased across the range.\n\nThe NE three-door Sports and five-door Superwagon added a limited slip differential, front bumper overriders, spare wheel cover, side pin striping, 16-inch chrome wheels, and optional two-tone paint over the base cars. The most expensive models also received an inclinometer, volt meter, oil pressure gauge, stereo cassette player, remote fuel filler release, suspension driver's seat, carpeting, and tweed and velour cloth trim (over tweed cloth and vinyl).\n\nSeptember 1988's NF facelift saw the introduction of a 3.0-litre V6 engine in the top-line Superwagon, delivering and via a five-speed \"V5MT1\" manual or four-speed \"KM148\" automatic. Suspension became a three-link coil spring design at the rear. Rear disc brakes were fitted to the V6 only.\n\nThe final NG refresh from September 1989 to April 1991 was a minor trim and equipment readjustment. The \"KM148\" automatic transmission was replaced by the \"V4AW2\" with lockup. High-end NG models (i.e. not the base Commercial trim) now received chrome, truck-style side mirrors. An intercooler was also added to the 2.5-litre turbo diesel models in 1990.\n\nThe Camel Trophy was a vehicle-oriented competition that was held annually between 1980 and 2000, and it was best known for its use of Land Rover vehicles over challenging terrain. The event took its name from its main sponsor, the Camel cigarette brand. The first event was originally intended as a one-off publicity stunt for Camel tobacco. This came about after six Germans had the idea of driving the notoriously tough Transamazonica Highway in Brazil; 1600 km of dusty, rutted, broken dirt road with several treacherous river crossings through the Amazon.\nThough little information is available online, Mitsubishi entered several long wheelbase, first generation Pajeros in the Camel Trophy and even created a limited \"Camel Trophy Edition\" to commemorate the event and their participation. Interestingly the limited edition versions were short wheelbase whereas the actual competing vehicles were long wheelbase due to the need to carry large amounts of equipment. The competing and Camel Trophy Edition vehicles both featured 2.5L turbo diesel 4D56 engines with a 5 speed manual transmission.\n\nSome of the special accessories these vehicles came with are the now iconic mustard yellow body and wheel paint, Camel Trophy logo on the driver and passenger doors, floor mats, seats and spare tyre cover, PTO winch, a recovery kit with shovel, black powder-coated roof rack and a special bush knife. Only 150 of this edition were ever made, though several enthusiasts have created replicas using their own SWB Pajeros from the time with spare parts that were still available from OEM part stockists. Currently many of these parts can still be found new including the highly desirable PTO winch. \n\nOriginal Camel Trophy editions can be identified by a yellow and black plaque inside the vehicle and a special chassis code (VNTX5).\n\nMitsubishi redesigned the Pajeros for a second generation, which debuted in January 1991, although exports did not commence until later in the year. Just about everything was now new and further enhanced. A new, larger body was available in four different versions; Metal Top, Canvas Top Convertible (short wheelbase), Semi High Roof Wagon and High Roof Wagon (long wheelbase). The short wheelbase models were stretched by and the long-wheelbase models by . The available engines included a 3.0-litre 12-valve SOHC V6 (6G72) with ECI-Multi electronic fuel injection and a 2.5-litre turbocharged diesel engine (4D56T) with an intercooler.\n\nThe second generation also saw the introduction of \"Super Select\" 4WD (SS4) [known as ActivTrak 4WD in some markets], Multi-Mode ABS and electronic shock absorbers which were firsts on Japanese four-wheel drives. SS4 was ground-breaking in the sense that it combined the advantages of part-time and full-time four-wheel drive with four available options: 2H (high-range rear-wheel drive), 4H (high-range full-time four-wheel drive), 4HLc (high-range four-wheel drive with locked centre differential) and 4LLc (low-range four-wheel drive with locked centre differential). Another advantage of this second generation system is that it gave the driver the ability to switch between two-wheel drive and full-time four-wheel drive at speeds up to 80 km/h (49 mph), whereas the first generation Pajero which used a traditional 4WD system had to be stationary to switch from rear-wheel drive to four-wheel drive (but not from four-wheel drive back to rear-wheel drive). In addition to the SS4, an pneumatic locking differential was included as a factory option. The transfer case is required to be in 4HLc or 4LLc to engage the rear locking differential. Multi-mode ABS, on the other hand, was equally innovative. This meant ABS would be fully functional in all modes of SS4, as braking with a locked centre differential requires completely different braking parameters. The new electronic shock absorber was also factory option with three settings: S (soft), M (medium), and H (hard). This meant driver can change ride quality and handling depending on road conditions via a switch on centre console.\n\nIn July 1993, two new power plants were introduced; a 3.5-litre 24-valve DOHC with ECI-Multi and a 2.8-litre turbocharged diesel with an intercooler. A new, larger transmission and transfer case was also part of the upgrade.\n\nIn 1996 the 3.0 V6 engine was revised, staying SOHC but changing to 24 valves. At the same time the ignition system was upgraded from the old distributor system to solid state coil packs. Power increased to . The 2.4 L engine was introduced as a smaller power plant; available only in the SWB with revised minor interior and exterior.\n\nThe Pajero Evolution was introduced in October 1997, which was developed in specifically in response to new entry requirements for the Paris – Dakar Rally's T3 Class, mandating a minimum volume of production vehicles to be produced on which the rally car would be based on. The Pajero Evolution was designed from the ground up as a dedicated rally vehicle. It came standard with a 3.5-litre 24-valve DOHC V6 with Mitsubishi Innovative Valve Timing and Electronic Lift Control (MIVEC). A new, dual plenum variable intake helped increase power and a new, long-travel independent rear suspension made the ride even smoother. This fully independent suspension design set the underpinnings for what would be implemented in the third generation Pajero. \n\nIn 1998, vehicles destined for General Export and the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council countries) received a facelift. Wider fenders, new headlights, grille, bumper, fog lights and sidesteps were all part of the redesign. The wide fenders are often called \"blister flare fenders\". Driver and front-passenger SRS airbags were made standard on models equipped with the 3.5-litre DOHC V6 engine, whilst still remaining optional on GLS models with the 3.0-litre SOHC V6. 1080 of these units were also assembled in Iran by Bahman Khodro Group before being taken off production. An upgraded interior wood trim was made available on 3.0-litre GLS and 3.5-litre models. A leather-wrapped or leather and wood trim steering wheel was also made available, alongside an upgraded suspension and steering system. The 3.0-litre 12-valve SOHC engine was now available with a 24-valve configuration. Models without wide fenders remained as base models (GLX), available with a 2.4-litre 16-valve DOHC engine, producing . The 3.0-litre 12-valve engine was optional on these GLX models, and remained the base engine on the GLS.\n\nThe second generation was introduced on 22 January 1991 and manufactured until 1999. It retained the two body styles, but design was rounder and more city-friendly than the previous bulky model. The 3.0 L V6 petrol engine was retained, now available with a 24-valve head, capable of , while the 2.5 turbodiesel's power was slightly increased to . In 1993, the Pajero was slightly restyled, and larger engines were introduced, a 3.5 L V6 with and a 2.8 L SOHC turbodiesel rated at . These versions introduced Mitsubishi's Super Select four-wheel-drive system (known as Active-Trac in the United States), with an electronic transfer shift that could split power between both axles without the need to stop the car. It worked at speeds up to .\n\nThe first generation Pajero was also marketed as the Hyundai Galloper in Korea, Europe and GCC Countries, while the second generation was in production elsewhere.\n\nThis model Pajero remained in production in India till 2012 as the Pajero SFX; the latest generation is sold as the Montero. In the Philippines it is marketed as the Pajero \"Field Master\" 4x2 with the 2.8L TD engine, alongside the fourth generation Pajero. The 4X4 version was taken out of production in 1999. It is also produced in Colombia from Complete Knock Down parts (CKD) till 2012, with a 2.4l 16 valve SOHC (130 PS) or 3.0l 12 valve V6 (148 PS), both engines are available as a three-door hard top, the five-door wagon only with the 3.0-litre V6.\n\nIn Venezuela, the second generation was manufactured from 1992 to 1995 under the name of Mitsubishi Montero, it was available in long and short wheel base. From 1996 to 2009 its name was changed to Mitsubishi Montero Dakar, it was only available in short wheel base with \"6G72\" engine and manual five-speed transmission.\n\nIn China, the second generation Pajero remains popular as it was involved in early joint ventures from the 1990s. Companies include Guangtong Motors, Jincheng Motors, Jinhui Motors, Sanjiu Motors, Sanxing Motors, Shanlu Motors and Wanli Motors.\n\nChinese car manufacturer Shanlu Motors made their version of the Pajero known as the CJY 6421D and was produced from 1997 to 2001 and came standard with the 4G64 engine. Beijing Automobile Works followed suit and produced their version known as the BJ2032 Tornado from 2002 to 2004. The BJ2032 came standard with a 2.2-litre engine sourced from General Motors paired to a 5 speed manual gearbox. The Tornado is 4880 millimetres long, 1830 millimetres wide, 1800 millimetres high and utilizes a 2750 millimetre wheelbase.\n\nThe most well known variants of the Pajero sold in China were built by GAC Changfeng since 1995. The first known model was produced from 2002 to 2014 and marketed under the name Liebao Heijinggang (猎豹奇兵-黑金刚 Leopaard Black King Kong, whereas 猎豹 can be translated to 'cheetah' instead of 'leopard') for the 2002 model year. The Heijinggang was available with four engines, the 2.2-litre \"4RB3\" based on the \"2RZ-FE\" engine from Toyota, the popular 2.4-litre \"4G64\" engine and \"6G72\" V6 from both Mitsubishi and a 2.5-litre turbo diesel. All engines were paired to a 5 speed manual gearbox. The 4 speed automatic was only available on the 2002 Heijinggang with the V6 engine. Throughout its production run, pricing ranged between 109,800 and 302,800 yuan (15,930 and US$43,930). \n\nThe sister model, known as the Qibing/6481, was produced from 2009 until 2014. The 2.2-litre \"4RB3\" was the only engine available paired to a 5-speed manual gearbox. Two models were available priced at 99,800 and 124,800 yuan (14,480 and US$18,100).\n\nBoth models were replaced by a face-lifted version called the Leopard Q6 (猎豹Q6) that year and is still in production today. The Q6 used the \"4G63\" for 2015 and 2017 models paired to a 6 speed manual and automatic gearbox. The \"2TZ-FE\" engine from Toyota was also available alongside it paired to a 5 speed manual gearbox. For 2019 onwards, the Q6 currently uses the \"4G64\" like its predecessors and uses a 5 speed manual gearbox. Two colours choices known as: Wild Green and Glacier White are available as standard.\n\nThe second generation Pajero was discontinued in 1999 (with the exceptions mentioned under \"Production\"), and replaced by a new-generation Pajero. After ending production, the second generation Pajero gained unwanted attention in 2002 when TLC member Left Eye was killed in a car crash involving a second generation Mitsubishi Pajero, on a highway in La Ceiba, Honduras. She was the only fatality in the crash. A camera man was filming from the front passenger's seat, and his camera was destroyed on impact.\n\nDesigned in house, the third generation Pajero debuted in the Japanese domestic market in 1999, and in other markets in late 2000 as a 2001 model — and in the Philippines and other developing nations in 2003.\n\nThe third generation was redesigned with a lower, wider stance and unibody (monocoque) construction with integral ladder frame chassis for increased torsional rigidity and drastically improved cabin strength when compared to typical body-on-frame (ladder frame) designs. This was in part due to Mitsubishi's RISE reinforcement system which resulted in a chassis and body combination that exhibited impressive structural integrity in rollover accidents and was completely unaffected by severe chassis loading as would typically experienced during off-road recoveries . The fuel tank was relocated between the front and rear axles to improve weight distribution and improve ground clearance. This generation was full-sized SUV, rather than mid-sized, and featured a fold and tumble, reclining second row 60/40 split seat and a stowable / removable third row seat.\n\nThe Super Select 4 (SS4) system was also further refined: bevel gears were replaced with planetary gears. This meant the front-to-rear torque setting ranged from 33 to 67, with the ability to adjust to 50/50 depending on surface conditions. The system was also made fully electronic, meaning the vehicle didn't have to be in gear to switch between drive modes. After all the upgrades, the system was renamed to Super Select 4WD II (SS4-II).\n\nAlongside rack and pinion steering (as opposed to the recirculating ball system on previous generations), the Pajero also offered a choice of three transmissions; a five speed manual, a four speed INVECS-II automatic and a five speed INVECS-II tiptronic.\n\nAn all-new 3.8 litre SOHC 24-valve V6 powerplant was also introduced on this generation. This engine utilized an Electronic Throttle Valve (ETV), to deliver a refined cruising power with power to spare for off-road ventures.\n\nThe third generation was introduced on 2 August 1999 and was scheduled to be replaced by the Autumn of 2006. It received a minor face lift in 2003. The 3.0 L engine's power was increased to , and the 3.5 L engine was given petrol direct injection, increasing power to in the Japanese market (export versions kept the standard EFI engine, now with . The 2.8 L Diesel was retained only for developing markets, and was replaced by a new 16-valve direct injection engine, with 3.2 L and .\n\nIn the North American market, the 3.5 L engine was replaced for 2003 by a more powerful 3.8 L unit, with . This engine was later made available to export markets such as South America, Australia and New Zealand, whilst it replaced the GDI V6 in the Japanese lineup in 2005. The short wheelbase model is not available in North America, where the Montero was the only SUV in Mitsubishi's lineup with standard four-wheel drive as opposed to all-wheel-drive. The Montero left the US market after the 2006 model year.\n\nThe fourth generation debuted at the Paris Motor Show on 30 September 2006 with the series code \"NS\". Revised interior and exterior styling were accompanied by dual-stage SRS front airbags as well as new side-impact and curtain airbags. The chassis was a mildy improved monocoque with Mitsubishi's RISE technology as featured in the previous generation. The innovative Super-Select 4WD II system was retained, complemented by an improved Active Stability & Traction Control (ASTC) system and electronic brakeforce distribution with of ground clearance and a 700mm wading depth — as well as more extensive skid plating, a carbon-fibre-wrapped rear driveshaft and aluminium bonnet to reduce weight. The fourth generation retained the same fully-independent suspension as the previous generation, with improvements to the rear axle assembly for improved strength and reliability off road as well as 17\" alloy wheels on GLS trim. Brakes too were upgraded to larger 332mm front rotors on LWB versions. SWB versions retained the 289mm rotors from the previous generation until later in production.\n\nEngines were upgraded with the 3.2 L diesel gaining Common Rail technology, a DPF for cleaner emissions and producing . The 3.8 L V6 gained MIVEC variable valve timing to boost power to . Both engines met Euro IV emissions standards. The 3.0 L V6 is retained for the Japanese and GCC markets. In Indonesia, this model was only marketed in Super Exceed trim. \n\nFrom 2009 a new series was introduced; \"NT\", the 3.0L V6 engine was dropped in the GCC markets, and was replaced by a 3.5L V6 engine, rated for and torque. Further revisions to the 3.2 L Turbo Diesel in the 2011 model year saw the power and torque increased to and respectively. Both engines met Euro V emissions standards. The 3.8 L petrol engine remained at and (using 95 RON fuel). There is also a panel van version available in markets where such a model can be registered at a lower tax rate. Vehicles also received a rear locking differential as standard \n\nFor the 2010 model year the Pajero gained a Rockford acoustic sound system and two interior color options, black and beige, in some markets.\n\nFor 2012, the Pajero model was minimally restyled and given an improved monocoque body and suspension with the series designation \"NW\".\n\nFor the 2015 model year the Pajero received an updated front fascia with a revised grille, LED daytime running lights and a new spare tire cover under the series \"NX\". This series is currently the most recent and still in production. The interior was revised to include metallic trim, piano black accents for the VR II, wood grain trim for the Exceed and Super Exceed and additional sound deadening material. The engines were carried over and include the 3.0 L \"6G72\" V6, the 3.5 L \"6G74\" V6, the 3.8 L \"6G75 MIVEC\" V6, the 2.8 L four-cylinder turbo diesel \"4M40\", and the 3.2 L \"4M41\" common rail four-cylinder turbo diesel.\n\nNotably, the Pajero features one of the most durable independent suspension designs for its class. This, coupled with the popular 3.2 L Di-D and 3.8 L MIVEC engines has contributed to a strong reputation for reliability in challenging environments such as Africa, Australia and the Middle East. \n\nThe Pajero was discontinued in Japan in August 2019 with the release of \"Final Edition\" model, which is limited to 700 units. However, is still sold in international markets where demand remains high such as Australia, the Middle East and South America, among others.\n\n2006 (IIHS, model 20012006)\n\n2013 (ANCAP: 5 stars):\n\nhttps://www.ancap.com.au/safety-ratings/mitsubishi/pajero/2aac99\n\nFrontal Offset:\n\nEach body region is scored out of 4 points.\nHead / neck: 4.00,\nChest: 3.90,\nUpper legs: 4.00,\nLower legs:1.51\n\nThe passenger compartment held its shape reasonably well in the \noffset crash test.

{"id": "1983503", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1983503", "title": "William Smallwood", "text": "William Smallwood\n\nWilliam Smallwood (1732February 14, 1792) was an American planter, soldier and politician from Charles County, Maryland. He served in the American Revolutionary War, rising to the rank of major general. He was serving as the fourth Governor of Maryland when the state adopted the United States Constitution.\n\nSmallwood was born in 1732 to planter Bayne Smallwood (1711–1768) and Priscilla Heaberd Smallwood (born c. 1715). He had six siblings: Lucy Heabard Smallwood (born c. 1734), Elizabeth F. Smallwood (born c. 1736), Margaret F. Stoddert (born c. 1738, married Walter Stoddert c. 1760), Heabard Smallwood (born c. 1740), Priscilla Courts (born c. 1742, married John Courts c. 1760), and Eleanor Smallwood. His sister Eleanor and brother Hebard served with him later in the Revolutionary War. His parents sent the boys to England, for their education at Eton. His great-grandfather was James Smallwood, who immigrated in 1664 and became a member of the Maryland Assembly in 1692. James' son Bayne (1685–1709) followed him later in the Assembly. Bayne (1711–1775) and his sister Hester were the great-great-grandchildren of Maryland Governor William Stone; Hester (Smallwood) Smith's daughter-in-law Sarah (Butler) Stone was the grandmother of James Butler Bonham and Milledge Luke Bonham. A first cousin of James and Milledge Bonham was Senator Matthew Butler\n\nSmallwood served as an officer during the French and Indian War (the North American theater of the Seven Years' War). He was elected to the Maryland provincial assembly.\n\nWhen the American Revolutionary War began, he was appointed a colonel of the 1st Maryland Regiment in 1776. He led the regiment in the New York and New Jersey campaign, where the regiment served with distinction. On December 21, 1777, he commanded 1,500 Delaware and Maryland troops at the Continental Army Encampment Site to prevent occupation of Wilmington by the British and to protect the flour mills on the Brandywine. For his role at the Battle of White Plains, in which he was twice wounded, Smallwood was promoted to brigadier general. He continued to serve under George Washington in the Philadelphia campaign, where his regiment again distinguished itself at Germantown. Thereafter, he quartered at the Foulke house, also occupied by the family of Sally Wister.\nIn 1780 he was a part of General Horatio Gates' army that was routed at Camden, South Carolina; his brigade was among the formations that held their ground, garnering Smallwood a promotion to major general. Smallwood's accounts of the battle and criticisms of Gates' behavior before and during the battle may have contributed to the Congressional inquiries into the debacle. Opposed to the hiring and promotion of foreigners, Smallwood objected to working under Baron von Steuben. Smallwood briefly commanded the militia forces of North Carolina in late 1780 and early 1781 before returning to Maryland, staying there for the remainder of the war. He resigned from the Continental Army in 1783 and served as the first President-General of the Maryland Society of the Cincinnati.\n\nSmallwood was elected to Congress in 1785. He was elected Governor of Maryland before he could take up the Congressional seat and chose the governorship. In 1787 he convened the state's convention that in 1788 adopted the United States Constitution.\n\nSmallwood never married. The 1790 census shows that he held 56 slaves and a yearly tobacco crop of 3000 pounds. When he died in 1792 his estate, known as Mattawoman, including his home the Retreat, passed to his sister Eleanor who married Colonel William Grayson of Virginia. William Trueman Stoddard was orphaned at age 9 and raised by his maternal grandfather, Bayne Smallwood). His burial site is now the Smallwood State Park in Marbury, Maryland.\nLocal historical signs in Calvert, Maryland, note that General Smallwood occupied the \"East Nottingham Friends House\" at the intersections of Calvert Road and Brick Meetinghouse Road (near the intersection of 272 and 273) about 6 miles east of Rising Sun, Maryland.\nDuring his occupation of the building in 1778, Gen. Smallwood used the building as a hospital. Some of the soldiers who died in the building were buried in the graveyard directly outside. \nSmallwood frequented the \"Cross Keys Inn\" (built in 1774), at the time a several-room inn and bar. This building stands as a private residence at the intersection of Calvert Road and Cross Keys Road directly down the hill. His restored plantation home, Smallwood's Retreat, is located at Smallwood State Park. Smallwood Church Road leads from the State Park toward Old Durham Church, where he was a vestryman.\n\nSeveral paintings exist of Smallwood. One hangs in the Old Senate Chamber in the Maryland State House in Annapolis, Maryland. The portrait of George Washington resigning within the Maryland State House, which hangs in the US Capitol Rotanda, features Smallwood.\n\nFeatured in the Maryland Historical Society is The William Smallwood Collection, 1776–1791, MS. 1875.\n\nSmallwood's name was honored in places and organizations.\n\n"}

Having the 'benefit of counsel' or 'assistance of counsel' means that the criminal defendant has had a competent attorney representing them. Competence is defined as reasonable professional assistance and is defined in part by prevailing professional norms and standards. To prove they received ineffective assistance, a criminal defendant must show two things:\n\nThe foregoing test was set forth in \"Strickland v. Washington\" (1984), in which the United States Supreme Court also established that failure to inform a defendant of the direct consequences of a sentence qualifies as ineffective assistance of counsel, but failure to inform of collateral consequences of criminal charges does not. The Court carved out an exception regarding immigration consequences for noncitizens, including inadmissibility and deportation resulting from a criminal conviction, in \"Padilla v. Kentucky\" (2010), reversing a conviction where counsel incorrectly advised a noncitizen that pleading guilty would not have negative immigration consequences.\n\nIneffective assistance of counsel may also be a ground for voiding a waiver of the right to appeal that a defendant may have signed as part of a plea agreement with prosecutors.\n\nUnder the two-prong \"Strickland\" standard, criminal convictions have been affirmed on appeal even where the defense attorney fell asleep during the prosecutor's cross-examination of the defendant, was heavily intoxicated on alcohol throughout the trial, was in extremely poor health and senile, was mentally ill (and even discussed his delusions in opening argument), or was himself a convicted felon whose sentence included community service in the form of defending accused murderers (despite his lack of experience in such cases).\n\nThe point of \"Strickland\" is that even extremely incompetent performance of counsel does not support a finding of \"ineffective\" assistance, if there was also independent and substantial evidence of the defendant's guilt—or if the end result would have probably been the same in the specific case, even with a competent counsel.\n\n"}

The United States Supreme Court has crafted a doctrine which requires the court to engage in a specific line of inquiry. Because a guilty plea must be made intelligently, knowingly, and voluntarily, the court must advise the defendant of the following things:\nThe court must ask the defendant if he understands each of these points, and must receive a voluntary affirmative response. Many courts use a script of the questions which the judge will ask the defendant and the defense attorney in a specific order. Failure by the court to advise the defendant of any of the above points will supply the grounds for a collateral attack on the plea; if such an attack is successful, the guilty plea will be withdrawn, and the defendant will be given the opportunity to enter a new plea. The court can accept and bind the defendant to a guilty plea, even if the defendant insists that he is innocent, and merely taking the plea to avoid conviction by a jury.\n\nPursuant to the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, a criminal defendant has the right to be represented by an attorney during a plea colloquy; failure of the state to provide an attorney to an indigent defendant during such proceedings is grounds for an appeal. It is possible - but very difficult - for a defendant who \"is\" so represented to have a plea thrown out due to ineffective assistance of counsel. The defendant must make a positive showing that but for the erroneous advice of counsel, he would not have chosen to plead guilty.\n\n"}

The air interface involves both the physical and data link layers (layer 1 and 2) of the OSI model for a connection.\n\nThe physical connection of an air interface is generally radio-based. This is usually a point to point link between an active base station and a mobile station. Technologies like Opportunity Driven Multiple Access (ODMA) may have flexibility regarding which devices serve in which roles. Some types of wireless connections possess the ability to broadcast or multicast.\n\nMultiple links can be created in limited spectrum through FDMA, TDMA, or SDMA. Some advanced forms of transmission multiplexing combine frequency and time division approaches like OFDM or CDMA.\nIn cellular telephone communications, the air interface is the radio-frequency portion of the circuit between the cellular phone set or wireless modem (usually portable or mobile) and the active base station. As a subscriber moves from one cell to another in the system, the active base station changes periodically. Each changeover is known as a handoff. Inverted F antenna use as mobile phone interface medium. In radio and electronics, an antenna (plural antennae or antennas), or aerial, is an electrical device which converts electric power into radio waves, and vice versa.[1] It is usually used with a radio transmitter or radio receiver. In transmission, a radio transmitter supplies an electric current oscillating at radio frequency (i.e. a high frequency alternating current (AC)) to the antenna's terminals, and the antenna radiates the energy from the current as electromagnetic waves (radio waves).\nAn antenna focuses the radio waves in a certain direction. Usually, this is called the main direction. Because of that, in other directions less energy wil be emitted. The gain of an antenna, in a given direction, is usually referenced to an (hypothetical) isotropic antenna, which emits the radiation evenly strong in all directions. The antenna gain is the power in the strongest direction divided by the power that would be transmitted by an isotropic antenna emitting the same total power. In this case the antenna gain (Gi) is often specified in dBi, or decibels over isotropic. \nOther reference antennas are also used, especially: •gain relative to a half-wave dipole (Gd), when the reference antenna is a half-wave dipole antenna;\n•gain relative to a short vertical antenna (Gv), when the reference antenna is a linear conductor, much shorter than one quarter of the wavelength.\n\nThe data link layer in an air interface is often divided farther than the simple Media access control (MAC) and Logical link control (LLC) sublayers found in other OSI terminology. While the MAC sublayer is generally unmodified, the LLC sublayer is subdivided into two or more additional sublayers depending on the standard. Common sublayers include:\nEspecially in mobile telecommunication and internet broadband Maximal combined input ratio with respect to signal to noise ratio estimation\n1. The signals from each channel are added together\n\n2. The gain of each channel is made proportional to the rms signal level and inversely proportional to the mean square noise level in that channel.\n\n3.Different proportionality constants are used for each channel.\n\nsmart matrix array for combine input signal gain separated them with filters and different types of output multiplexed schemes are used for approach to multiple users for example CDMA, FDMA, WCDMA, TDMA, and ODMA.

He was the Deputy Clerk of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong for a short period in 1933. In 1934, he was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple and attended the Imperial Defence College later that year.\n\nGrantham became Colonial Secretary of Bermuda from 1935 to 1938, and of Jamaica from 1938 to 1941. He then served as Chief Secretary of Nigeria from 1941 to 1944 and as Governor of Fiji and High Commissioner for the Western Pacific from 1945 to 1947.\n\nImmediately after his tenure as High Commissioner ended, he became Governor of Hong Kong, until 1957. He opposed his predecessor, Sir Mark Young's proposal of expanding social services on the ground that the local Chinese population cared little about social welfare.\n\nHis tenure marked the beginning of a unitary housing policy by the Hong Kong Government. In December 1953, a fire burned down a large slum area in Shek Kip Mei, Kowloon, killing nine and leaving many homeless. It was under Grantham's administration that the government began to build settlement houses for the homeless. From that point on, the government was deeply involved in low-cost public housing programmes that allowed many Hong Kong people who could not afford to own a flat to live in government-owned housing estates at relatively low cost. The housing programme eventually evolved over time to allow people to buy low-cost housing and receive favourable loans to buy their own houses.\n\n\nGrahan grew up partly in Tientsin where his father practiced Law, both his father and brother was killed in World War I. His mother then remarried Johan Wilhelm Normann Munthe and the family moved tho Beijing. He was married twice. His first marriage, in 1925, was to the well-travelled Maurine Samson, daughter of the late Amos Roland Samson and Liberty \"Libby\" Cole (Neal) of Champaign County, Illinois. Born in Lincoln, Nebraska, she had lived in Boise, Seattle, San Francisco and Honolulu before their marriage. The Governor's official yacht, a Hong Kong health clinic and a locomotive were all named \"Lady Maurine\" after her. After she died in 1970, Grantham married Mrs M. E. Lumley in 1972.

He came from a Lebanese-Palestinian father and a Lebanese-Syrian mother on 5 May 1960.\n\nKassir received his degree in political philosophy in 1984. He gained a DEA (roughly equivalent to a Master's degree in the British university system) in philosophy and political philosophy from Pantheon-Sorbonne University in the same year. He obtained his PhD in modern and contemporary history from Paris-Sorbonne University in 1990, with a thesis on the Lebanese Civil War.\n\nSamir Kassir's journalistic career began when he was a seventeen-year-old secondary school student at the \"Lycée Français de Beyrouth\", with unsigned contributions to the Lebanese Communist Party newspaper \"Al-Nidā\"'. The same year, he began contributing to the French-language daily \"L'Orient-Le Jour\". From 1981 to 2000, he contributed to the French international political review \"Le Monde Diplomatique\". In 1982 and 1983 he edited the newsletter \"Le Liban en Lutte\" (Struggling Lebanon), which was dedicated to the Lebanese resistance against the Israeli occupation. From 1984 to 1985 he edited the weekly \"Al-Yawm as-Sābi`\", and from 1986 to 2004 he was a member of the editorial board of the \"Revue des Etudes Palestiniennes\", the French-language journal of the Institute for Palestine Studies. From 1988 to 1989 he contributed to the London-based pan-Arab daily \"Al-Hayat\".\n\nIn 1995 he founded a new monthly political and cultural review, \"L'Orient L'Express\", which he edited until it ceased publication in 1998, from lack of interest and pressure from the advertising industry. From that year on he was a professor at the \"Institut des sciences politiques de l'Université Saint-Joseph\" in Beirut. It was also in 1998 that Kassir became an editorial writer for the daily \"Al-Nahar\" newspaper. He became widely known for his popular weekly column in which he wrote strong articles against the pro-Syrian government. He also made frequent appearances on several television stations as a political analyst on news programs.\n\nKassir was assassinated using a car bomb in a Christian part of Beirut on 2 June 2005, just a few days after the general elections. The investigation into his assassination is still underway, but to date no one has been indicted. Since he had been constantly receiving threats from Lebanese and Syrian Intelligence Officers, there is widespread speculation in Lebanon that the perpetrators were the Lebanese-Syrian security apparatus or remnants of this force (as Syria has claimed that all its intelligence officers were out of Lebanon; in addition, the head of the Lebanese security forces had resigned). The Syrian government has denied these charges.\n\nOn 4 June, a funeral ceremony was performed for him in Beirut with the attendance of hundreds.\n\nThere was widespread condemnation for the killing and many prominent opposition figures blaming the blast on the Lebanese and Syrian governments. Among them were Hariri's son, Saad Hariri, who said \"the blood-stained hands that assassinated Rafiq Hariri are the same ones that assassinated Samir Kassir.\" Moreover, Elias Atallah, Secretary General of the Democratic Left Movement, urged his allies to the presidential palace and remove president Lahoud. However, the calls remained unanswered. Years later, March 14 allies admitted that had Lahoud been removed, Lebanon would have been spared the later political assassinations.\n\nKassir was among the first victims in the growing list of political assassinations that occurred in Lebanon from 2004 to 2008. These began with the attempted assassination of Marwan Hamadeh and followed with the killing of Rafik Hariri in 2005. After Kassir, George Hawi, the former head of the Lebanese Communist Party was targeted by another car-bomb; this was followed by failed assassination attempts at former Interior Minister and former Syrian ally Elias Murr and popular LBCI TV anchorwoman and journalist May Chidiac who survived, but lost an arm and leg. On 12 December 2005, Samir Kassir's colleague, \"An Nahar\"'s chief editor, and top anti-Syria legislator Gebran Tueni, was killed by a car bomb. Pierre Amine Gemayel, the former Minister of Industry, was another victim in the series of assassinations. MP Walid Eido from the Hariri-led Future movement was killed near the Military Bath of Beirut on 13 June 2007. Shortly afterwards, MP Antoine Ghanem of the Lebanese Phalanges Party (aka Kataeb Party), was killed in another car bomb on 19 September 2007 in the Sin al-Fil suburb of Beirut. Then, second-in-command of the Lebanese Armed Forces, General François al-Hajj was killed in the military-secured suburb of Baabda on 12 December 2007. One month later, security chief and top Lebanese investigator into the International Tribunal for the Hariri assassination was killed in January 2008. Many have blamed Syria for all the recent assassinations of its opponents.\n\nA prominent left-wing activist, Kassir was a strong advocate of freedom for the Palestinians, democracy in Lebanon and Syria and a vocal critic of the Syrian presence in Lebanon. He was a keen advocate of secular democracy in the Middle East.\n\n\" ... What [Arab-American] reconciliation needs, if the United States were really willing to reach such reconciliation, is first [America's] revision of its understanding of Arab democracy, which has been restricted until now, to the American convention that mandates Arabs give up their pan-Arab ties... and the issues that steer their feelings most, on top of them the Palestinian issue ...\"\n\nKnown for his unrelenting courage, Kassir was unafraid of expressing trenchant opinions. He continuously spoke for the rights of the Palestinians. He recognised courage and determination in others and took under his wing leading young pro-democracy and human rights activists such as Wissam Tarif, with whom Kassir developed a warm and close friendship. It was his non-compromising views on the Ba'ath government that many believe led to his assassination.\n\nHe maintained a keen and sympathetic interest in Syria despite his criticism of its involvement in Lebanon, and was on close terms with many Syrian intellectuals, including those involved in the Damascus Spring. He was a founding member of the Democratic Left Movement, which won a seat in the Lebanese parliamentary elections of 2005. Kassir and the party he helped establish were both very influential in triggering the popular upheavals following Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's killing.\n\nKassir's books, in French and Arabic, include a history of Beirut and a study of the Lebanese Civil War. He also co-authored a book about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and Palestinian-French relations. His last book in Arabic concerned with the \"Damascus Spring\" and the consequences for Lebanon of Syrian political developments; Syrian dissident film-maker Omar Amiralay penned its introduction. Before his assassination, he was working on another book about the \"Beirut Spring\" that aimed to discuss the recent momentous developments in Lebanon, that was supposed to be published by Actes Sud. In February 2006, a book was published with the same title, by Actes Sud, but contained translations of Arabic articles written mainly after Hariri's assassination.\n\nHe was an Eastern Orthodox Christian married to Giselle Khoury, a talk-show host on Al-Arabiya television. He is survived by two daughters, Mayssa and Liana, from a previous marriage.\n\nHis wife, Giselle Khoury, and a group of Kassir's friends, students and colleagues from l'Orient Express, including writer Elias Khoury, created the Samir Kassir Foundation. One of the foundation's objectives would be translating his works into English, Italian, and Norwegian. A special edition of l'Orient Express was published in November 2005 to celebrate its tenth anniversary under the title \"The Unfinished Spring\" and was dedicated in memory of Kassir. This project was initially Kassir's idea who was working on it before he was assassinated. A square in downtown Beirut, behind the Annahar building, was named in Kassir's honor.\n\nThe EU Delegation to Lebanon and the Kassir Foundation initiated a journalism prize in 2006.

{"id": "1983584", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1983584", "title": "Hash join", "text": "Hash join\n\nThe hash join is an example of a join algorithm and is used in the implementation of a relational database management system. All variants of hash join algorithms involve building hash tables from the tuples of one or both of the joined relations, and subsequently probing those tables so that only tuples with the same hash code need to be compared for equality in equijoins.\n\nHash joins are typically more efficient than nested loops joins, except when the probe side of the join is very small. They require an equijoin predicate (a predicate comparing records from one table with those from the other table using a conjunction of equality operators '=' on one or more columns).\n\nThe classic hash join algorithm for an inner join of two relations proceeds as follows:\nThe first phase is usually called the \"build\" phase, while the second is called the \"probe\" phase. Similarly, the join relation on which the hash table is built is called the \"build\" input, whereas the other input is called the \"probe\" input.\n\nThis algorithm is simple, but it requires that the smaller join relation fits into memory, which is sometimes not the case. A simple approach to handling this situation proceeds as follows:\n\n\nThis is essentially the same as the block nested loop join algorithm. This algorithm scans formula_4 eventually more times than necessary.\n\nA better approach is known as the \"grace hash join\", after the GRACE database machine for which it was first implemented.\n\nThis algorithm avoids rescanning the entire formula_4 relation by first partitioning both formula_2 and formula_4 via a hash function, and writing these partitions out to disk. The algorithm then loads pairs of partitions into memory, builds a hash table for the smaller partitioned relation, and probes the other relation for matches with the current hash table. Because the partitions were formed by hashing on the join key, it must be the case that any join output tuples must belong to the same partition.\n\nIt is possible that one or more of the partitions still does not fit into the available memory, in which case the algorithm is recursively applied: an additional orthogonal hash function is chosen to hash the large partition into sub-partitions, which are then processed as before. Since this is expensive, the algorithm tries to reduce the chance that it will occur by forming the smallest partitions possible during the initial partitioning phase.\n\nThe hybrid hash join algorithm is a refinement of the grace hash join which takes advantage of more available memory. During the partitioning phase, the hybrid hash join uses the available memory for two purposes:\nBecause partition 0 is never written to or read from disk, the hybrid hash join typically performs fewer I/O operations than the grace hash join. Note that this algorithm is memory-sensitive, because there are two competing demands for memory (the hash table for partition 0, and the output buffers for the remaining partitions). Choosing too large a hash table might cause the algorithm to recurse because one of the non-zero partitions is too large to fit into memory.\n\nHash joins can also be evaluated for an anti-join predicate (a predicate selecting values from one table when no related values are found in the other). Depending on the sizes of the tables, different algorithms can be applied:\n\n\nThis is more efficient when the NOT IN table is smaller than the FROM table\n\n\nThis is more efficient when the NOT IN table is larger than the FROM table\n\nHash semi-join is used to return the records found in the other table. Unlike plain join, it returns each matching record from the leading table only once, not regarding how many matches are there in the IN table.\n\nAs with the anti-join, semi-join can also be left and right:\n\n\nThe records are returned right after they produced a hit. The actual records from the hash table are ignored.\n\nThis is more efficient when the IN table is smaller than the FROM table\n\n\nWith this algorithm, each record from the hash table (that is, FROM table) can only be returned once, since it is removed after being returned.\n\nThis is more efficient when the IN table is larger than the FROM table\n\n"}

The station is owned by Entercom through licensee Entercom License, LLC and broadcasts an adult contemporary format. Its studios are located on Clarkview Road in the Mount Washington neighborhood of Baltimore, while its broadcast tower is located near Loch Raven Reservoir near Towson. at ().\n\nThe station began broadcasting February 6, 1960, as WAQE-FM, simulcasting 1570 WAQE. In 1967, the station's call sign was changed to WTOW-FM, and the station simulcast the programming of 1570 WTOW.\n\nIn 1970, the station's call sign was changed to WLIF. The station went silent February 18, 1970, and returned to the air on December 24, 1970, after Sudbrink Broadcasting bought the station. In the 1970s and into 1980s, WLIF aired a beautiful music format. The station featured SRP programming (Schulke Radio Productions, created by Jim Schulke). WLIF was one of the highest-rated stations in Baltimore during its beautiful music years.\n\nThe station played mostly instrumental renditions of popular songs. Featured artists included Percy Faith, John Fox, Chet Atkins, Richard Clayderman, Frank Mills, Henry Mancini, Ray Anthony, Floyd Cramer, and many others. The station played four vocal selections per hour and they were only smooth vocal stylings of artists like Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles, Nat King Cole, Neil Diamond, Tony Bennett, Patti Page, Dionne Warwick, Barbra Streisand, and others. Its slogan was \"The Beautiful Place In Your Life\" branded as \"FM-102\". In the 1980s, WLIF began playing more soft rock hits, such as those by Linda Ronstadt, The Beatles, The Temptations, Elton John, along with the previously played artists. During morning and afternoon drives, the station was about half instrumental and half vocal, while other times the station continued to play one vocal every quarter-hour. In the late 1980s, the station shifted to roughly half vocalists and half instrumentals.\n\nBy 1990, WLIF had shifted to a soft adult contemporary format, and began to be simulcast on AM 1300 WLIF. This simulcast lasted until September 1991. The station was branded \"Lite 102\". By 1993, WLIF began mixing in current material in its playlist.\nIn 2001, the station changed branding again, to \"101.9 Lite FM\". Today, its lineup consists of adult contemporary hits. In the late 2000s, the station carried the syndicated Delilah radio show to complement the popular local love songs programming that was hosted by Fran Lane (Lane left WLIF in December 2019); however, Delilah aired during the late-night hours, and this resulted in its eventual elimination from the station. On the weekends, WLIF featured \"The Flashback Weekend\" featuring former WQSR announcers Dave Alan, John Summers and Diane Lyn (Lyn left WLIF in July 2019) playing the greatest hits of the 1960s and 1970s. However, in recent years, these songs have been replaced by music from the 1980s, thus creating an \"All-80s Weekend\"; the eighties songs were mixed in with the sixties and seventies hits during the latter part of the \"Flashback Weekend\" era.\n\nMary Anne Perry Hoffman worked at WLIF from 1992-2004. Hoffman returned to WLIF a couple years later, only to leave again in December 2014. Mary Anne Perry Hoffman is currently a news reporter for Maryland News Network.\n\nIn addition, WLIF (along with WWIN) also played jazz music during the weekends for many years. WLIF continued to play jazz until 2004, when WSMJ became Baltimore's full-time Smooth Jazz station (that station has since changed formats, first to Alternative in 2008, then to Top-40/CHR a year later).\n\nOn December 29, 2013, at Midnight, after playing \"It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas\" by Johnny Mathis, WLIF rebranded as \"Today's 101.9\", with its first song being \"Hey Soul Sister\" by Train. Like its AC sister stations KEZK-FM in St. Louis, WDOK in Cleveland, and KVIL in Dallas, WLIF retooled its format to more hot adult contemporary-leaning fare to attract a new generation of listeners, even though it also continues to play the standard AC songs from the 1980s to present. It was the last surviving \"Lite FM\"-branded station to be owned by CBS Radio, with the moniker having been dropped from KVIL in Dallas and WLTE in Minneapolis (with the latter station also undergoing a format change to country at the time).\n\nOn February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th.\n\nWLIF is well known for its Christmas programming. For decades, WLIF began mixing in Christmas music the week before Thanksgiving and went to wall-to-wall Christmas music about two weeks before Christmas. They would remain all Christmas music until the middle of December 26 or later, and would keep mixing in Christmas music until New Year's Day.\n\nBeginning in 2001, every year, starting the week before Thanksgiving, the station plays nothing but Christmas music, well into December 26 or 27. There are no advertisements all day on Christmas Day. After 2007, WLIF played wall to wall Christmas music not only before Thanksgiving, but all the way until New Year's Eve. They were the last station left playing Christmas music at New Year's. Most stations in the market that feature Christmas music continue mixing it in throughout the last week of the year, unlike many places that end abruptly on December 26. In 2010, WLIF dropped Christmas music early on December 27, but continued mixing a few songs in rather than remaining wall-to-wall until January 1. In 2014, WLIF dropped Christmas Music at midnight on December 26, drawing negative feedback from many listeners. They continued this practice through 2018. In 2019, WLIF dropped Christmas music on December 29.\n\nWLIF began HD Radio broadcasts in 2006. WLIF-HD2 aired a country format, branded as \"New Country @ 106.1\". The format began on October 25, 2013 at Noon, replacing the 1980s hits \"Flashback\" format that has aired since WLIF began HD Radio operations. The programming was simulcast on translator W291BA (106.1 FM), which is owned by Hope Christian Church of Marlton, and is being leased to CBS to operate it. WLIF-HD3 airs an oldies format, branded as \"The Flashback Channel\", while WLIF-HD4 airs programming from \"HOPE FM\" as part of an agreement between CBS and Hope Christian Church where CBS will operate W291BA and another translator, W248AO (97.5 FM), which airs an alternative rock format branded as \"HFS @ 97-5\" (that format has since been moved to another translator owned by Hope, W285EJ (104.9 FM)).\n\nOn April 9, 2015, Radio One announced that they will assume operations of W291BA from CBS, and flipped the format to urban gospel, branded as \"Praise 106.1\", on May 1.\n\nThe following translators are licensed to Hope Christian Church of Marlton, Inc and simulcast the programming of WLIF-HD2 and WLIF-HD4:\n\n"}
{"id": "1983607", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1983607", "title": "Hugh Selwyn Mauberley", "text": "Hugh Selwyn Mauberley\n\nHugh Selwyn Mauberley (1920) is a long poem by Ezra Pound. It has been regarded as a turning point in Pound's career (by F.R. Leavis and others), and its completion was swiftly followed by his departure from England. The name \"Selwyn\" might have been an homage to Rhymers' Club member Selwyn Image. The name and personality of the titular subject is also reminiscent of T. S. Eliot's main character in \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\".\n\nThe poem comprises eighteen short poems which are grouped into two sections. The first is an autobiography of Ezra Pound himself, as indicated by the title of the first poem, which reads \"E.P. Ode pour l'élection de son sépulchre\" (\"Ezra Pound: Ode for the Choice of His Sepulchre\"). The second section introduces us to the struggling poet \"Mauberley\"’s character, career and fate. Readers have been misled by the fact that Pound assigns to every poem a title or, alternatively, a number. Thus poem I, \"E.P. Ode pour l'Election de Son Sépulchre\", is followed by poems II-V, that are numbered, while poems VI to IX are again given individual titles. As a consequence, in some websites \npoems II-V are reprinted as if they were parts II-V of \"E.P. Ode\". They are in fact individual poems in a sequence of which \"E.P.: Ode\" is only poem I.\n\n\"Hugh Selwyn Mauberley\" addresses Pound's alleged failure as a poet. F.R. Leavis considered it \"quintessential autobiography.\"\n\nSpeaking of himself in the third person, Pound criticises his earlier works as attempts to \"wring lilies from the acorn\", that is to pursue aesthetic goals and art for art's sake in a rough setting, America, which he calls \"a half-savage country\". \"For three years, out of key with his time/He strove to resuscitate the dead art/Of poetry\" resonates with Pound's efforts to write in traditional forms (e.g., \"Canzoni\", 1911) and subsequent disillusionment. Pound in his mock-epitaph is said to be \"wrong from the start\", but this is quickly qualified: \"No, hardly-\". The rest of the poem is essentially a defense of Pound, who, like Capaneus, was fighting against the unsurmountable flood of philistinism.\n\nIn the third stanza, Pound is said to have listened to the song of Homer's Syrens (quoted in Greek: \"Ἴδμεν γάρ τοι πάνθ', ὅσ 'ένι Τροίη\" - \"We know all the things that belong to Troy\"), to have confronted dangers and ignored the warnings of the prudent. This has led inevitably to his being dismissed as an outsider and forgotten by the literary establishment, \"in the 31st year of his life\", i.e. circa 1916, when Pound published \"Lustra\".\n\nIn Poems II and III, Pound turns the tables upon the philistine modern age, denouncing its materialism, consumerism, bad taste and betrayal of tradition. Poems IV and V express Pound's outrage at World War I, a murderous product of that very age that has dismissed him: \"There died a myriad/And of the best, among them,/For an old bitch gone in the teeth,/For a botched civilisation\".\n\nThis section can be read as a wider attack upon the attitudes of society in the post-war period, on a \"botched civilisation\"-denounced as an intellectual and moral 'Waste Land' only two years later by T. S. Eliot. The exclamation \"Better mendacities/ Than the classics in paraphrase!\" seems to be a quip at the expense of those who continue to revere the idealistic \"lies\" and to dismiss works that draw on valuable traditional texts, such as Pound's own \"Homage to Sextus Propertius\".\n\nPoems VI-XII are a brief overview of British culture as Pound found it when he arrived in London in 1908, starting with the Preraphaelites and the Rhymers' Club, and closing with vignettes of three writers (Max Beerbohm, Arnold Bennett, Ford Madox Ford), a suburban wife and a literary hostess.\n\nPoem XII formally closes with a criticism of the current tastes and concerns of society:\n\nAs \"Pierian roses\" refers to the place in Greece where the Muses were worshiped, the charge is that society has become absorbed in commodities and lost its taste for art.\n\nPart I terminates with \"Envoi\", i.e. \"Farewell\", a poem printed in italics in which Pound in fact \"resuscitates the dead art of poetry\" (as he had said in Poem I) by addressing a singer in \"canorous lyric measures\" (Leavis). \"Envoi (1919)\" ends on a positive note. Its last lines are: \"Till change hath broken down / All things save Beauty alone.\"\n\nThe second part of the poem, \"Mauberley 1920,\" introduces the character Hugh Selwyn Mauberley, a minor poet who perfects refined but irrelevant artworks, or \"medallions\". His defeat is told (by Pound) in Poem I in short minimalist lines, of the kind that Mauberley himself would write. Poem II tells us of Mauberley's love-troubles, suggesting that he observed beauty but could not act at the right moment (as a Henry James character, see for example \"The Beast in the Jungle\", and Eliot's \"Prufrock\"). Poem III is a narrative criticism of Mauberley as aesthete, and Poem IV closes his story by telling us that he retired and expired in the Pacific islands. Like Part I, Part II has a farewell poem, \"Medallion\", the description of a female singer, seen as a work of art rather than as a woman. This poem has usually been read by critics as \"written by Mauberley\", an example of his kind of frosty albeit perfect writing. Mauberley in his passiveness is distinct from Pound, who however pursued for a while similar ideals of artistic perfection, and was attracted by life in beautiful and remote natural surroundings. By moving to Italy in 1925, Pound in a way exiled himself like Mauberley, while becoming increasingly involved in the conflicts of his age. Thus in \"Mauberley\" Pound portrayed and criticised certain aspects of himself, as Eliot had done in \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\". Yet while \"Prufrock\" is ironic, \"Mauberley\" is largely a work of satire, reminiscence and invective, like \"The Cantos\".\n\n"}

The phrase is a paraphrasing of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.'s opinion in the United States Supreme Court case \"Schenck v. United States\" in 1919, which held that the defendant's speech in opposition to the draft during World War I was not protected free speech under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.\n\nThe paraphrasing differs from Holmes's original wording in that it typically does not include the word \"falsely\", while also adding the word \"crowded\" to describe the theatre. The original wording used in Holmes's opinion (\"falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic\") highlights that speech that is dangerous false is not protected, as opposed to speech that is dangerous but also true.\n\nHolmes, writing for a unanimous Court, ruled that it was a violation of the Espionage Act of 1917 (amended by the Sedition Act of 1918), to distribute flyers opposing the draft during World War I. Holmes argued this abridgment of free speech was permissible because it presented a \"clear and present danger\" to the government's recruitment efforts for the war. Holmes wrote:\n\nThe First Amendment holding in \"Schenck\" was later partially overturned by \"Brandenburg v. Ohio\" in 1969, which limited the scope of banned speech to that which would be directed to and likely to incite imminent lawless action (e.g. a riot). The test in \"Brandenburg\" is the current Supreme Court jurisprudence on the ability of government to proscribe speech after that fact. Despite \"Schenck\" being limited, the phrase \"shouting \"fire\" in a crowded theater\" has since come to be known as synonymous with an action that the speaker believes goes beyond the rights guaranteed by free speech, reckless or malicious speech, or an action whose outcomes are obvious.\n\nChristopher M. Finan, Executive Director of the National Coalition Against Censorship, writes that Justice Holmes began to doubt his decision due to criticism received from free-speech activists. He also met the legal scholar Zechariah Chafee and discussed his \"Harvard Law Review\" article \"Freedom of Speech in War Times\". According to Finan, Holmes's change of heart influenced his decision to join the minority and dissent in the \"Abrams v. United States\" case. Abrams was deported for issuing flyers saying the US should not intervene in the Russian Revolution. Holmes and Brandeis said that \"a silly leaflet by an unknown man\" should not be considered illegal. Chafee argued in \"Free Speech in the United States\" that a better analogy in \"Schenck\" might be a man who stands in a theatre and warns the audience that there are not enough fire exits.\n\nIn his introductory remarks to a 2006 debate in defense of free speech, writer Christopher Hitchens parodied the Holmes judgement by opening \" Fire, fire ... fire. Now you've heard it\", before condemning the famous analogy as \"the fatuous verdict of the greatly over-praised Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes.\" Hitchens argued that the socialists imprisoned by the court's decision \"were the ones shouting fire when there really a fire in a very crowded theatre indeed... [W]ho's going to decide?\"\n\nThere is one documented case of a person shouting \"Fire!\" in a theater, when there truly was no fire. It was at the Mount Morris Theatre in New York's Harlem neighborhood in 1884. In this case, no panic ensued. \n\nIn contrast, in the Brooklyn Theatre fire of 1876, the actors initially falsely claimed that the fire was part of the performance, in an attempt to avoid a panic. However, this delayed the evacuation and made the resulting panic far more severe.\n\n"}

It features 12 teams divided into two groups which compete for the \"SNK Cup\" (the main differences between teams is their formations on the field): Group A (Germany, Italy, Spain, England, Mexico, Japan) and Group B (Argentina, Holland, Brazil, France, United States, South Korea)\n\nThe players' team plays against all the others in their group, then it goes into an elimination tournament's semifinals and then the final to win the cup. There was also a hidden feature in the game, which wasn't documented, and affects a single player game. During a free kick for the CPU if the player has tapped button A for player two, the CPU performs a short-shot, while pressing the button A performs a longer kick.\n\nOne noted mistake was that Spain's kit would actually resemble Portugal's. Portugal would not be in the game until Super Sidekicks 3.\n\nOn release, \"Famicom Tsūshin\" scored the game a 25 out of 40. The game was ported to the Nintendo Switch in 2017 by Hamster Corporation.\n\nPublished in 1994 (Japanese title: \"Tokuten Ou 2 - Real Fight Football\"), the sequel corrected most of the flaws in the original's design, including the ability to switch players' control during the game, a smaller goal, and no more long shots taken (in Super Sidekicks 1 the simple long shot was sometimes too long, leading into a throw-in situation). It increased the number of teams to 48 and divided them into 6 geographical \"regions\" (new teams underlined):\nUpon starting the game, the player goes into a \"Regional Qualifying Round Final\" against another team from the same region. After beating it, the player's team goes into the World (Cup) Tournament, in which they are grouped with three other countries in a round-robin. After winning against all of them, the team enters an elimination tournament: the quarterfinals, semifinals, and the final for the World Cup. This type of tournament thus is more reminiscent of the real-life World Cup. If a match ends in a draw, the player has the option of replaying a full game, going to the penalty kick tiebreaker, or playing a sudden death (golden goal) game (the golden goal feature was not present in the original Super Sidekicks); however, the arcade version requires an extra credit for these options.\n\nAll subsequent Super Sidekicks games followed the same design and gameplay as \"Super Sidekicks 2\".\n\n\"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" gave the game an 8 out of 10, applauding its control, intense action, sound effects, and overall arcade game quality. They later ranked it number 38 in the 1995 EGM Hot 50.\n\nPublished in 1995 (Japanese title: \"Tokuten Ou 3 - Eikoue no Michi\", \"Goal-Scoring King 3: Path to the Glory\"), the third game features 64 national teams divided into 8 regions:\nThe World Tournament mode is the same as Super Sidekicks 2, above.\n\nThe new features in this game include naming the player scoring goals for his team and keeping score of how many goals he scores during his team's use by the player. Alongside the \"Top Teams\" ranking which serves as a high score table for teams, there is a \"Top Scorer\" table for individual players. The name and use of scoring players is random.\n\nThe second new feature include \"regional tournaments\", in which a team (from any region) can enter a tournament within its own region or other regions. This is good for those players who like a particular team but don't want to be facing the same opponents every time, as they would if they played the World tournament. Championships include World Tournament (FIFA World Cup), Europe Tournament (UEFA European Football Championship), South America Tournament (Copa América), Americas Tournament (CONCACAF Gold Cup), Africa Tournament (African Cup of Nations), and Asia Tournament (AFC Asian Cup).\n\nThe game was re-released three years later under the name \"\". In order to mirror the 1998 FIFA World Cup, some player names, kits and teams were changed:\nHowever, the game played and looked exactly like the original \"Super Sidekicks 3\". Even the goal animations remained unchanged.\n\nOnce again, SNK failed to get official FIFA license and featured fake names. However, some reflect actual players. Roul represents Raúl of Spain, Dahl represents Martin Dahlin of Sweden, and Klinger represents Jürgen Klinsmann of Germany.\n\nIn \"Neo Geo Cup 98\", teams face teams of their group in the 1998 qualification instead of regions in the game. For example, if the player selects Spain, they play against Yugoslavia. However, some are inaccurate. For example, if the player picks Brazil, they play against Uruguay before the World Tournament. But Brazil qualifies automatically.\n\nThe game was also re-released as a part of \"SNK Arcade Classics Vol. 1\" on PS2, PSP and Wii.\n\nThe two sports reviewers of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" both gave the Neo Geo version an 8 out of 10. They praised the graphics, sound, and particularly the easy playability. \"GamePro\" called it \"a fun, fast-paced game that will appeal to fans and nonfans alike.\" They particularly praised the graphics and the \"quick and intuitive\" control interface. \"Maximum\" gave the Neo Geo CD version two out of five stars, saying it suffers from \"wooden\" gameplay and inaccurate ball physics.\n\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the Neo-Geo version of the game, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \"If there were no other soccer games out there, this one would probably be considered great, but...\"\n\nPublished in 1996 (Japanese title: \"Tokuten Ou - Honoo no Libero\", \"Goal-Scoring King: The Flaming Sweeper\") Despite the international title, it is still considered the fourth game in the Super Sidekicks series. It features 80 national teams divided into 8 regions:\nThe players scoring the goals are still named, but individual scores are no longer kept. The regional tournaments have been eliminated and replaced with alternate mode the \"SNK Football Championship\", which is the game's namesake, an elimination tournament in which the player can select any one opponent from any region to play. The last region played is the deciding match. Good player performance opens up a match again a hidden boss team called the \"SNK Superstars\", which features characters from SNK's fighting games as players.\n\nTeams now have a charge bar (similar to the one in fighting games), which is charged depending on how long the player keeps the ball under their team's control. When the bar is fully charged and flashing, if a player is near the goal, they can take a shot that is virtually unblockable, depending on the opposing team. Teams are \"ranked\" from 1 to 80, mirroring their real-life counterparts.\n\n\"The Ultimate 11\" was one of the few Neo-Geo games to feature a corporate sponsor: Akai.\n\n"}

He was lord clerk register of Scotland, 1768–1816; Member of Parliament (M.P.) for Glasgow Burghs (1761–1780) and for Argyllshire (1780–1799).\n\nFrederick Campbell was the third son of John Campbell, 4th Duke of Argyll, and his wife, Mary, daughter of John, 2nd Lord Bellenden. Lord Frederick was educated at Westminster School (1743-6) and Christ Church, Oxford (1747) before entering Middle Temple (1751) and being called to the Bar in 1754.\n\nAlthough his father had intended him for the parliamentary seat of Ayr Burghs, he instead succeeded his brother Lord Lorne to the seat of Glasgow Burghs in 1761.\n\nIn 1765, being very intimate with Mr. Grenville, Lord Frederick was active in the arrangements for transferring the prerogatives and rights of the Duke of Atholl in the Isle of Man (then a nest of smugglers), to the Crown, and in fixing the compensation to be given; but he felt and complained that the compensation was inadequate.\n\nIn the same year (1765) Lord Frederick was for a few months Keeper of the Privy Seal of Scotland but resigned in July following the dismissal of the Grenville administration and was succeeded in the office by Lord Breadalbane. Lord Frederick was sworn of the privy council 29 May 1765, made Lord Clerk Register for Scotland in 1768, and confirmed in that office for life in 1777. In 1774 Lord Frederick had laid the foundation-stone for a register house at Edinburgh, and procured a permanent establishment for keeping the records, and received the thanks of the court of session. He was elected Rector of Glasgow University for 1772–73.\n\nLord Frederick sat in the Irish House of Commons for Thomastown from 1767 to 1768 and for St Canice from 1768 and 1776.\n\nIn 1778 he was colonel of the Argyle Fencibles, in 1786 a member of the board of control for India, and from 1787 to 1793 the joint Vice-Treasurer of Ireland under George, Viscount Townshend, the Lord-lieutenant. As a member of parliament he seems to have been reticent; but it was on his motion in 1796 that Henry Addington was elected speaker of the Great British Parliament. He was treasurer of the Middle Temple in 1803. He died 8 June 1816 in Queen Street, Mayfair.\n\nLord Frederick was married, 28 March 1769, to Mary, youngest daughter of Mr. Amos Meredith of Henbury, Cheshire, sister of Sir William Meredith, 3rd Baronet, and widow of the infamous Laurence Shirley, 4th Earl Ferrers. She was burnt to death in a fire at their house, Combe Bank, Kent, in 1807. They had two daughters, one of whom, Mary, married Captain Donald Campbell of Barbreck.\n\nLord Frederick had inherited Combe Bank (or Coombe Bank), near Sevenoaks, Kent, on the death of his father in 1770. His daughter sold the estate to William Manning, MP after his death.\n\nA Canadian school was named after him. Port Charlotte, Islay is named after his wife.\n\n"}

The new port was named Parkeston Quay, after Charles H. Parkes, Chairman of the GER. The existing railway line was re-routed to pass through the port, although the original railway embankment, through an overgrown area known locally as The Hangings, still exists. Most of the terraced housing in Parkeston was built for railway employees and some of the streets in the village have names that can be theoretically linked to the shipping and general activities of the railway, examples being Tyler Street (paddle steamer \"The Lady Tyler\"), Hamilton Street (paddle steamer \"Claud Hamilton\"), Adelaide Street (paddle steamer \"Adelaide\") and Princess Street (paddle steamer \"Princess of Wales\").\n\nClaud Hamilton, a former chairman of GER, also gave his name to Hamilton Park, the extensive playing fields between the village and the station/quay area.\n\nParkeston is known locally as \"Spike Island\" or \"Cinder City\". The 'Cinder City' name was particularly appropriate given the large areas of marshland or saltings that were reclaimed, frequently using waste material from the railway activities.\n\nThere can be very few examples of a village created by a railway company to house the company's workers for their very extensive railway and shipping services. The railway operation also included a locomotive shed and very extensive marine workshops to service the fleet of vessels based on the port, comprising up to a dozen ferries and cargo vessels at a peak.\nFrom early in the 20th century, major passenger ferry services were developed, mainly to the Hook of Holland (with the slogan \"Harwich to the Hook of Holland\") and later to Esbjerg in Denmark. During both World Wars, however, Parkeston served as an important naval base. Parkeston Quay is now named Harwich International Port and the railway station is named Harwich International. Parkeston is also now faced, across the Stour estuary, by the UK's busiest container port, the Port of Felixstowe.\n\nOther than the port, the area of Parkeston that has seen the largest expansion in recent years is Harwich Gateway Retail Park, a retail district located in what is otherwise known as Iconfield Park, an area of land next to the port on the outskirts of Parkeston. The first shop to be built in the location was Safeway, a supermarket that opened in March 1997, and is currently a Morrisons store. This stood alone for many years, until a flurry of activity in the mid-2000s saw the proper formation of the retail park: a multi-unit development opposite the supermarket, the discount supermarket Lidl off the roundabout between the two, a Premier Inn and Brewers Fayre (opened October 2004 alongside Lidl, and most recently a Home Bargains store, opened in November 2014 on the opposite side of the retail park. There has also been a small housing estate called \"The Gateway\" built next to Lidl to accommodate the growth of the area.\n\nAs of February 2015, Focus has been replaced by B & M, and Bon Marché has closed, with no replacement. The pink area marked \"Iconfield\" on pages four and five denotes the location of Home Bargains.\n\nThe village also suffered very severe flooding in the East Coast Floods of that springtime. The railway embankment which also acted as the sea wall was breached south of the loco shed immediately east of the village.\n"}

He worked with theatre director Erwin Piscator and playwright Bertolt Brecht, both of whom identified with the political left.\n\nOn 12 October 1932, he changed his legal name to his stage name \"George\".\n\nAfter the Nazi takeover, George was classified as a \"non-desirable\" actor at first because of his earlier political affiliations and was thus barred from working in cinematic productions. However, he was eventually able to reach an accommodation with the Nazi regime. In 1937, George was designated as a \"Staatsschauspieler\" (i.e. an actor of national importance) and in 1938 was appointed director of the Schiller Theater in Berlin. George actively collaborated with the Nazis and agreed to star in Nazi propaganda films such as \"Hitler Youth Quex\" (1933), \"Jud Süß\" (1940), and \"Kolberg\" (1945) as well as appearing in numerous newsreels.\n\nGeorge had a stocky build and a Berlin accent which made him readily recognizable to German audiences. George's prestige as a leading actor of the day made him an \"extraordinarily valuable catch for the Nazis.\" Cooke and Silberman describe him as \"the actor most closely tied with fascist fantasies of the autocratic and the populist leader\".\n\nAlthough Heinrich George had been a member of the Communist Party of Germany before the Nazi takeover, he was nonetheless interned as a Nazi collaborator at the Soviet concentration camp in Sachsenhausen where he died in 1946.\n\nThe cause of his death was starvation, even though official reports stated that he died \"after an appendix operation\".\n\nHeinrich George married the German actress Berta Drews.

He is a member of the Hart wrestling family and the third child of Helen and Stu Hart, CM. He is best known for his work for Stampede Wrestling and several appearances for WWE, often with his siblings Bret, Owen, Bruce and Diana. In Stampede he won several championships and for WWE he participated in the seventh edition of Survivor Series.\n\nHart is the third child of wrestling promoter Stu Hart and his wife Helen, thus he is the younger brother of Smith and Bruce and the older brother of Wayne, Dean, Ellie, Georgia, Bret, Ross, Alison, Diana and Owen Hart.\n\nHe is of Greek descent through his maternal grandmother and Irish through his maternal grandfather. His father was mainly of Scots-Irish descent but also had Scottish and English ancestry. Hart is a dual citizen of Canada and the United States.\n\nBefore becoming a wrestler, Keith Hart earned a degree in teaching.\n\nHart had a lot of experience in amateur wrestling during his youth, something he did mostly to please his father.\n\nHart trained under his father and began wrestling on June 1, 1973 in his father's promotion, Stampede Wrestling, facing Lindy Calder in his debut match. He spent much of his career as a tag team wrestler, teaming with wrestlers such as his brother Bret, with whom he won the Stampede International Tag Team Championship four times. He feuded with wrestlers such as Dick Steinborn, Dynamite Kid, Herbert Gallant, K J Anderssen, Mr. Hito, and Mr. Sakurada. As a singles wrestler he held the British Commonwealth Mid Heavyweight title. In addition to wrestling in Canada, Hart performed in Germany, Japan and made infrequent appearances in the United States of America. At one point, Dave Meltzer referred to Hart as one of the best jobbers in wrestling.\n\nAs part of the feud between Bret and Jerry Lawler, at the 1993 Survivor Series Bret and his brothers Keith, Bruce and Owen faced Shawn Michaels and his three masked knights. Though Owen was eliminated and Keith's shoulder was injured by a prolonged assault at the hands of Michaels, the Hart brothers were victorious.\n\nIn the 1990s, Hart worked as a trainer in the Hart Dungeon (the wrestling training camp located in the basement of the Hart family mansion). He eventually retired in 1995 to become a full-time firefighter, although he briefly came out of retirement in 1999 when Stampede Wrestling was reopened by his brothers Bruce and Ross Hart. Hart became a tag team champion with Chris Benoit.\n\nIn the late 1970s, at the urging of his brother-in-law, B.J. Annis, Hart passed a test and was accepted into the Calgary Fire Department. As a result, he largely reduced his wrestling commitments. Hart would work for Annis until 2007, when he retired from firefighting after 26 years and began working as a substitute teacher. He is known to teach in Calgary and Okotoks (just outside Calgary).\n\nHart has appeared on several wrestling documentaries, including the 1998 documentary \"Wrestling with Shadows\" and 2010's \"\" which are both about his younger brother Bret. Hart was also present on the stage together with all his living siblings when his father Stu Hart was posthumously inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 1994 Hart and his first wife won $100,000 in a lottery. He spent some of the money on an unsuccessful campaign to get elected to provincial office.\n\nHart has three sons with his ex-wife Leslie, Stewart Hart II, Conor Hart and Brock Hart. The couple divorced in 1995. Conor pursued amateur wrestling at the University of Calgary and coaches a local high school team. His other son Stewart has also pursued amateur wrestling and has won a medal in \nhis school championship but does not wish to work with pro wrestling.\n\nIn 2002 Keith married for the second time to his long-time girlfriend Joan.\n\nFollowing the death of Stu Hart on October 16, 2003, the Hart family sold the Hart mansion.

The verse alludes to several Old Testament passages. Moses fasts for forty days and forty nights before writing the holy scripture, and Elijah in travels for the same period without food. Matthew, unlike Luke, adds \"and forty nights\" more closely linking the passage to the Old Testament. Another important parallel is with the entire nation of Israel that spent forty years in the desert without much food after the Exodus. A popular theory is that the entire temptation narrative is meant to parallel the history of Israel. Clarke notes that at the time forty was less a specific number and more a general expression for any large figure.\n\nFrance notes that fasting does not necessarily mean a complete abstinence from food and that Jesus may have been surviving on the sparse food that could be obtained in the desert. Mark does not mention this fasting and Luke implies it but does not use the word. Gundry notes that the author of Matthew seems to be a far more interested in this idea than the other evangelists, and in Matthew 6 again seems to present fasting as a model for good behaviour. This fasting became the model for the practice of Lent in the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches, a ritual that lasts forty days, but is today a less than total abstinence. Protestants, in general, do not see this passage as a justification for Lent. Martin Luther felt the ritual was artificial, but useful in focusing the minds of the faithful. John Calvin felt the entire notion was silly and that if imitating Jesus was truly the path to salvation then believers should be striving to walk on water or turn water to wine.\n\nSome early manuscripts containing the text of this verse are:\n"}

A former graduate of the academy himself, whose footballing career was cut short by injury, he joined the club's staff as a youth coach in 1973. Since then in his tenure as director, as of 2010, Carr is credited with producing talent which has earned an estimated £80 million in transfer fees for the club, while the 23-man England squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup contained no less than seven players trained by Carr – Rio Ferdinand, Frank Lampard, Joe Cole, Michael Carrick, Jermain Defoe, Glen Johnson and John Terry.\n\nCarr was born in Bow, East London and was a West Ham youth player, joining in 1966 as a trainee striker, and cleaning the boots of the famous World Cup players Geoff Hurst, Bobby Moore and Martin Peters. He had three seasons as a youth team player and two as a professional player for West Ham, reaching reserve team level. He played for one season at Barnet before breaking his leg which put him out of the game for over 18 months. During this time he qualified as a PE instructor.\nHe eventually stopped playing due to a career-threatening injury, although he has since admitted that he did not have the ability to play at the highest level.\n\nIn 1973, Carr was appointed as the Director of Youth Development at West Ham. Since then he has overseen the development of many talented players at what has become known within the game as The Academy of Football. As a developer of young talent he may be among the most successful and influential coaches in the United Kingdom, but he modestly argues differently: \"No way is it all down to me. It's very difficult to say why we've been so successful in youth terms; I suppose it's down to a number of factors but, most importantly, our recruitment area of east London and Essex is really fertile.\" (\"Daily Telegraph\" interview, 14 June 2004)\nHe was aided in his task by Chief Scout Jimmy Hampson, who is considered among the best talent-spotters in the United Kingdom.\n\nFor over thirty years Carr has arguably been the single most important member of West Ham's coaching staff. Since his original appointment in 1973, the club have had ten managers of the first team squad (not including Sir Trevor Brooking who had two stints as caretaker manager) but Tony Carr remains at his post developing the players of the future. Carr has collaborated with Better Football Coaching since 2007 to develop 'Smart Sessions', coaching advice for grassroots coaches. He has also participated in coaching seminars in the United States.\n\nOn 16 March 2009 it was announced that in recognition of Carr's 36 years of service to West Ham he had been awarded a testimonial year. Scheduled throughout the year are a number of golf tournaments and dinners. A testimonial game featuring a West Ham first team against a team of former academy players was played on 5 May 2010 at the Boleyn Ground.\n\nCarr was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2010 Birthday Honours for services to football.\n\nHe was replaced as West Ham's academy director in 2014 by Terry Westley after which time he took an ambassadorial role at West Ham. In 2016, he was offered a continuation of this role but with reduced terms and in a part-time capacity which he declined. He left the club after 43 years service.\n"}

On 11 April 2006, they were granted a further 30 days to keep their fire going, despite a Supreme Court order that they remove their tents by 2pm on 13 April 2006. The aboriginal protesters have since removed their tents, but are now sleeping in a dilapidated caravan parked in an all day car park. The Melbourne City Council has since started fining them $50 per day for overstaying the time limit. Protection (under a Court order) for the fire expired on 10 May 2006 and shortly after midnight on that date, council workers extinguished it.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1983704", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1983704", "title": "Shajar al-Durr", "text": "Shajar al-Durr\n\nShajar al-Durr (), also Shajarat al-Durr (), whose royal name was al-Malika ʿAṣmat ad-Dīn ʾUmm-Khalīl Shajar ad-Durr (; from her nickname , 'mother of Khalil'; ? – 28 April 1257), was a ruler of Egypt. She was the wife of As-Salih Ayyub, the last Egyptian sultan of the Ayyubid dynasty, and later of Izz al-Din Aybak, the first sultan of the Bahri dynasty. Prior to becoming Ayyub's wife, she was a child slave and Ayyub's concubine.\n\nIn political affairs, Shajar al-Durr played a crucial role after the death of her first husband during the Seventh Crusade against Egypt (1249–1250). She became the sultana of Egypt on May 2, 1250, marking the end of the Ayyubid reign and the start of the Mamluk era. There are several theories about the ethnic roots of Shajar al-Durr. Many Muslim historians believed that she was of either Bedouin, Circassian, Greek or Turkic origin and some believed that she was of Armenian origin.\n\nSeveral sources assert that Shajar al-Durr took the title of sultana ( ), the feminine form of sultan. But \"The Cambridge History of Islam\" disputes the claim, stating that \"a feminine form, sultana, does not exist in Arabic: the title \"sulṭān\" appears on Shajar al-Durr's only extant coin.\" Nevertheless, westerners often referred her as \"sultana\", because in their perspective, \"sultana\" was used for women and \"sultan\" for men.\n\nShajar al-Durr was of either Armenian or Turkic origin, and described by historians as a beautiful, pious and intelligent woman. She was purchased as a slave by As-Salih Ayyub in the Levant before he became a Sultan and accompanied him and Mamluk Baibars (not the Baibars who became a Sultan) to Al Karak during his detention there in 1239. Later when As-Salih Ayyub became a Sultan in 1240 she went with him to Egypt and gave birth to their son Khalil who was called al-Malik al-Mansour.<ref name=\"Ibn Taghri, pp.102-273/vol.6\">Ibn Taghri, pp.102-273/vol.6</ref> Some time after the birth, As-Salih Ayyub married her.\n\nIn April 1249, As-Salih Ayyub, who was gravely sick in Syria, returned to Egypt and went to Ashmum-Tanah, near Damietta after he heard that King Louis IX of France had assembled a crusader army in Cyprus and was about to launch an attack against Egypt. In June 1249, the crusaders landed in the abandoned town of Damietta, at the mouth of the river Nile. As-Salih Ayyub was carried on a stretcher to his palace in the better-protected town of Al Mansurah where he died on November 22, 1249 after ruling Egypt for nearly 10 years. Shajar al-Durr informed Emir Fakhr ad-Din Yussuf Ben Shaykh (commander of all the Egyptian army) and Tawashi Jamal ad-Din Muhsin (the chief eunuch who controlled the palace) of the Sultan's death but as the country was under attack by the crusaders they decided to conceal his death.<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi, p.444/vol.1\">Al-Maqrizi, p.444/vol.1</ref> The coffined body of the Sultan was transported in secret by boat to the castle on al-Rudah island in the Nile. Although the deceased Sultan had not left any testimony concerning who should succeed him after his death, Faris ad-Din Aktai was sent to Hasankeyf to call al-Muazzam Turanshah, the son of the deceased Sultan. Before he died, the Sultan signed a large number of blank papers which were used by Shajar al-Durr and Emir Fakhr ad-Din in issuing decrees and giving Sultanic orders and together they succeeded in convincing the people and the other government officials that the Sultan was only ill rather than dead. Shajar al-Durr continued to have food prepared for the sultan and brought to his tent. High officials, the Sultan's Mamluks and soldiers were ordered – by the will of the \"ill\" Sultan – to swear an oath of loyalty to the Sultan, his heir Turanshah and the Atabeg Fakhr ad-Din Yussuf.\n\nThe news of the death of as-Salih Ayyub reached the crusaders in Damietta and with the arrival of reinforcements led by Alfonso, Count of Poitou, the brother of King Louis IX, they decided to march on Cairo. A crusader force led by Louis IX's other brother Robert I of Artois crossed the canal of Ashmum (known today as Albahr Alsaghir) and attacked the Egyptian camp in Gideila, two miles (3 km) from Al Mansurah. Emir Fakhr ad-Din was killed during the sudden attack and the crusader force advanced toward the town of Al Mansurah. Shajar al-Durr agreed to Baibars's plan to defend Al Mansurah. The crusader force was trapped inside the town, Robert of Artois was killed and the crusader force was annihilated by an Egyptian force and the townspeople, led by the men who were about to establish the state which would dominate the southern Mediterranean for decades: Baibars al-Bunduqdari, Izz al-Din Aybak, and Qalawun al-Alfi.\n\nIn February 1250 the dead Sultan's son Al-Muazzam Turanshah arrived in Egypt and was enthroned at Al Salhiyah as he had no time to go to Cairo. With his arrival, Shajar al-Durr announced the death of as-Salih Ayyub. Turanshah went straight to Al Mansurah and on April 6, 1250 the crusaders were entirely defeated at the Battle of Fariskur and King Louis IX was captured.\n\nOnce the Seventh Crusade was defeated and Louis IX was captured, troubles began between Turanshah on one side and Shajar al-Durr and the Mamluks on the other. Turanshah, knowing he would not have full sovereignty while Shajar al-Durr, the Mamluks and the old guards of his late father were around, detained a few officials and started to replace old officials, including the deputy Sultan, with his own followers who had come with him from Hasankeyf. He then sent a message to Shajar al-Durr while she was in Jerusalem warning her and requesting her to hand over to him the wealth and jewels of his late father. The request and manners of Turanshah distressed Shajar al-Durr. When she complained to the Mamluks about Turanshah's threats and ungratefulness, the Mamluks, particularly their leader Faris ad-Din Aktai, were enraged. In addition, Turanshah used to drink alcohol and when drunk he abused the bondmaids of his father and threatened the Mamluks. Turanshah was assassinated by Baibars and a group of Mamluk soldiers at Fariskur on May 2, 1250. He was the last of the Ayyubid Sultans.\n\nAfter the assassination of Turanshah, the Mamluks and Emirs met at the Sultanic Dihliz and decided to install Shajar al-Durr as the new monarch with Izz al-Din Aybak as Atabeg (commander in chief). Shajar al-Durr was informed of this at the Citadel of the Mountain in Cairo and she agreed. Shajar al-Durr took the royal name \"al-Malikah Ismat ad-Din Umm-Khalil Shajar al-Durr\" with a few additional titles such as \"Malikat al-Muslimin\" (Queen of the Muslims) and \"Walidat al-Malik al-Mansur Khalil Emir al-Mo'aminin\" (Mother of al-Malik al-Mansur Khalil Emir of the faithful). She was mentioned in the Friday prayers in mosques with names including \"Umm al-Malik Khalil\" (Mother of al-Malik Khalil) and \"Sahibat al-Malik as-Salih\" (Wife of al-Malik as-Salih). Coins were minted with her titles and she signed the decrees with the name \"Walidat Khalil\". Using the names of her late husband and her dead son attempted to gain respect and legitimacy for her reign as an heir of the Sultanate.\n\nAfter paying homage to Shajar al-Durr, Emir Hossam ad-Din was sent to King Louis IX who was still imprisoned in Al Mansurah and it was agreed that Louis IX would leave Egypt alive after paying half of the ransom imposed on him earlier and surrendering Damietta in exchange for his life. Louis surrendered Damietta and sailed to Acre On May 8, 1250, accompanied by about 12000 freed war prisoners.\n\nNews of the murder of al-Muazzam Turanshah and the inauguration of Shajar al-Durr as the new Sultana reached Syria. The Syrian Emirs were asked to pay homage to Shajar al-Durr but they refused and the Sultan's deputy in Al Karak rebelled against Cairo. The Syrian Emirs in Damascus gave the city to an-Nasir Yusuf the Ayyubid Emir of Aleppo and the Mamluks in Cairo responded by arresting the Emirs who were loyal to the Ayyubids in Egypt. In addition to the Ayyubids in Syria, the \"Abbasid\" Caliph al-Musta' sim in Baghdad also rejected the Mamluk move in Egypt and refused to recognize Shajar al-Dur as a monarch. The refusal of the Caliph to recognize Shajar al-Durr as the new Sultana was a great setback to the Mamluks in Egypt as the custom during the Ayyubid era was that the Sultan could gain legitimacy only through the recognition of the Abbasid Caliph.<ref name=\"Shayyal, p.115/vol.2\">Shayyal, p.115/vol.2</ref> The Mamluks, therefore, decided to install Izz al-Din Aybak as a new Sultan. He married Shajar al-Durr who abdicated and passed the throne to him after she had ruled Egypt as Sultana for about three months. Though the period of Shajar al-Durr's rule as a monarch was of short duration, it witnessed two important events in history: one, the expelling of Louis IX from Egypt, which marked the end of the Crusaders' ambition to conquer the southern Mediterranean basin; and two, the death of the Ayyubid dynasty and the birth of the Mamluk state which dominated the southern Mediterranean for decades .\n\nTo please the Caliph and secure his recognition, Aybak announced that he was merely a representative of the Abbasid Caliph in Baghdad. To placate the Ayyubids in Syria the Mamluks nominated an Ayyubid child named al-Sharaf Musa as a co-sultan. But this did not satisfy the Ayyubids and armed conflicts between the Mamluks and the Ayyubids broke out. The Caliph in Baghdad, preoccupied with the Mongols who were raiding territories not far from his capital, preferred to see the matter settled peacefully between the Mamluks in Egypt and the Ayyubids in Syria. Through negotiation and mediation of the Caliph that followed the bloody conflict, the Mamluks who manifested military superiority reached an agreement with the Ayyubids that gave them control over southern Palestine including Gaza and Jerusalem and the Syrian coast. By this agreement the Mamluks not only added new territories to their dominion but also gained recognition for their new state.\nIn addition to the conflict with the Ayyubids of Syria, the Mamluks successfully countered serious rebellions in Middle and Upper Egypt. Then, Aybak, fearing the growing power of the Salihiyya Mamluks who, with Shajar al-Durr, had installed him as a Sultan, had their leader Faris ad-Din Aktai murdered. The murder of Aktai was followed instantly by a Mamluk exodus to Syria where they joined the Ayyubid an-Nasir Yusuf. Prominent Mamluks like Baibars al-Bunduqdari and Qalawun al-Alfi were among those Mamluks who fled to Syria. Aybak became the sole and absolute ruler of Egypt after the Salihiyya Mamluks who were the supporters of Shajar al-Durr left Egypt and turned against him.\n\nBy 1257 disputes and suspicion had become part of the relations between Aybak,<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi, p.493/vol.1\">Al-Maqrizi, p.493/vol.1</ref> a Sultan who was searching for security and supremacy, and his wife Shajar al-Durr, a former Sultana who had a strong will and managed a country on edge of collapse during an external invasion.\nShajar al-Durr wanted sole rule of Egypt. She concealed Sultanate affairs from Aybak; she also prevented him from seeing his other wife and insisted that he should divorce her. Instead, Aybak, who needed to form an alliance with a strong Emir who could help him against the threat of the Mamluks who had fled to Syria, decided in 1257 to marry the daughter of Badr ad-Din Lo'alo'a the Ayyubid Emir of al-Mousil. Badr ad-Din Lo'alo'a warned Aybak that Shajar al-Durr was in contact with an-Nasir Yusuf in Damascus. Shajar al-Durr, feeling at risk and betrayed by Aybak, the man whom she had made a Sultan, had him murdered by servants while he was taking a bath. He had ruled Egypt for seven years.\nShajar al-Durr claimed that Aybak died suddenly during the night but his Mamluks (Mu'iziyya), led by Qutuz, did not believe her and the servants involved confessed under torture. Shajar al-Durr and the servants were arrested and Aybak's Mamluks (the Mu'iziyya Mamluks) wanted to kill her, but the Salihiyya Mamluks protected her and she was taken to the Red Tower where she stayed. The son of Aybak, the 15-year-old al-Mansur Ali, was installed by the Mu'ziyyah Mamluks as the new Sultan. On 28 April, Shajar al-Durr was stripped and beaten to death with clogs by the bondmaids of al-Mansur Ali and his mother. Her naked body was found lying outside the Citadel. According to the historian Ibn Iyas, Shajar al-Durr was dragged from her feet and thrown from the top naked, with a cloth around her waist. She stayed in the moat for three days, unburied, until one night a mob came and took off the cloth around her waist because it was silk with pearls and had a smell of musk. The servants who were involved in the killing of Aybak were executed.\n\nShajar al-Durr was buried in a tomb, not far from the Mosque of Tulun, which is a jewel of Islamic funerary architecture. Inside is a mihrab (prayer niche) decorated with a mosaic of the \"tree of life,\" executed by artists brought from Constantinople specifically for this commission. The wooden kufic inscription that runs around the interior of her tomb, while damaged, is also of extremely fine craftsmanship.\n\nAl-Durr was well known for adopting the indigenous architecture of Bahri Mamluk tombs and combining them with \"Madrasas\" or schools of Islam. She was the first Islamic Sultan of Egypt to use this culturally-syncretized architecture. Al-Durr's burial structures would continue to be adopted by leaders in the Mamluk Sultanate, which shows that madrasas of Islam were embraced, and they remained in use to the Bahri Mamluks long after Islamic rule.\n\nBefore their deaths, Aybak and Shajar al-Durr firmly established the Mamluk dynasty that would ultimately repulse the Mongols, expel the European Crusaders from the Holy Land, and remain the most powerful political force in the Middle East until the coming of the Ottomans.\n\nShajar al-Durr is one of the characters of Sirat al-Zahir Baibars (Life of al-Zahir Baibars), a folkloric epic of thousands of pages that was composed in Egypt during the early Mamluk era and took its final form at the early Ottoman era. The tale, which is a mix of fiction and facts, reflects the fascination of Egyptian common people for both Baibars and Shajar al-Durr. Fatma Shajarat al-Durr, as the tale names Shajar al-Durr, was the daughter of Caliph al-Muqtadir whose kingdom in Baghdad was attacked by the Mongols. She was called Shajarat al-Durr (tree of pearls) because her father dressed her in a dress that was made of pearls. Her father granted her Egypt as she wished to be the Queen of Egypt and as-Salih Ayyub married her in order to stay in power as Egypt was hers. When Baibars was brought to the Citadel in Cairo, she loved him and treated him like a son and he called her his mother. Aybak al-Turkumani, a wicked man, came from al-Mousil to steal Egypt from Shajarat al-Durr and her husband al-Salih Ayyub. Shajarat al-Durr killed Aybak with a sword but, while fleeing from his son, she fell from the roof of the citadel and died. In addition, Shajar al-Durr's name actually means Tree of Pearls, which is why, in poetry, her mention shows a fruit tree that is formed by pieces of mother-of-pearl.\n\nTayeb Salih in his story \"The Wedding of Zein\" mentioned \"Shajar ad-Durr\" as \"the former slave girl who ruled Egypt in the thirteenth century.\"\n\nHe has a character in the story say, \"A man's a man even though he's drooling, while a woman's a woman even if she's as beautiful as Shajar ad-Durr.\"\n\nThe following names and titles were inscribed on the coins of Shajar al-Durr: al-Musta'simiyah al-Salihiyah Malikat al-Muslimin walidat al-Malik al-Mansur Khalil Amir al-Mu'minin. (The Musta'simiyah the Salihiyah Queen of the Muslims Mother of King al-Mansur Khalil Emir of the faithful) and Shajarat al-Durr. The names of the Abbasid Chaliph were also inscribed on her coins: Abd Allah ben al-Mustansir Billah.\n\n\n\n"}

The players are first- and second-year players selected by the NBA's assistant coaches. Two people designated as \"general managers\" draft players for the two opposing teams.\n\nThe Rookie Challenge, established in 1994, was originally competed by two randomly selected teams composed entirely of first-year players. This format was continued until 1996, when it was changed to pit rookie teams of both the Eastern and the Western Conference against each other. In 1999, the game was cancelled as a result of the NBA lockout. Since the 1998 rookie class did not compete that year, the game was revamped and featured a team of standout first-year players ('Rookies') against a team of standout second-year players ('Sophomores'). For 2012 and 2013, the format was changed to having two teams drafted by Basketball Hall of Famers Charles Barkley (Team Chuck) and Shaquille O'Neal (Team Shaq). In 2014, the two teams were drafted by Chris Webber (Team Webber) and Grant Hill (Team Hill). The format of the game and name was changed to the Rising Stars Challenge in 2012. The game format changed in 2015 to Team USA vs Team World, where each team should choose at least three Rookies and three Sophomores, and the squad of each team should have four back courts, four front courts and two swingmen.\n\nUnlike regular NBA games, the game was divided into two twenty-minute halves plus multiple five-minute overtime periods, similar to men's college basketball. The participating players were chosen by voting among the league's assistant coaches. In the game, players wear their respective regular team uniforms, except for 2009, in which players wore fan-designed jerseys. The head coaches of the two teams are the lead assistant coaches of the NBA All-Star Game coach. Starting in 2009, two active NBA players were added to the game coaching staffs.\n\nThe game is currently sponsored by Mtn Dew Kickstart. Before 2012, the event was known as the Rookie Challenge, officially named the T-Mobile Rookie Challenge and Youth Jam.\n\n<section begin=2020/>\n\n<section end=2020/>\n\n<section begin=2019/>\n\n<section end=2019/>\n\n<section begin=2018/>\n\n<section end=2018/>\n\n<section begin=2017/>\n\n<section end=2017/>\n\nTo celebrate the first time the NBA holds the All-Star game outside of the US, the game makes the World Team the home team instead of Team USA.\n<section begin=2016/>\n\nTeam USA won 157–154 in the highest scoring game in Rising Stars Challenge history.

A few days before the game, Tiago Splitter was injured and was replaced by Derrick Favors.

They inhabit the region of the Fourth Cataract of the Nile and call their homeland Dar al-Manasir. Similar to their neighbouring tribes, the upstream Rubatab (الرباطاب) and the downstream Shaiqiyah (الشايقيّة), the Manasir are an indigenous Nile culture who adapted Islam and became Arabic speakers. Unlike other riverine tribes of the Sudan, a considerable part of their population lives as Bedouins in the adjacent Bayudah Desert. The nomadic life of herding their stock of goats, sheep and camels in desert valleys is however limited for many to the rainy season, coinciding with the annual inundation of the Nile.\n\nSimilar to other Arab tribes, the people trace their origins back to one historical ancestor. According to the current oral tradition of many Manasir, this person is called Mansur and belongs to the line of descendants of al-'Abbas, the uncle of Muhammad.\nAccording to their self-presentation in a publication by a committee of Manasir responsible for relocation issues resulting from the Merowe Dam, which is going to affect all villages of Dar al-Manasir, multiple explanations of their origin are offered (LAGNAH 2005:2):\n\nEarlier travellers witnessed Beja and Bisharin influences from the Red Sea Hills among the Manasir (INNES 1931:187).\nStrong similarities of their burial customs with that of the Nubians can still be observed (cf. CAVENDISH 1966, Local beliefs among the Manasir).\n\nCritical research suggests that the current Manasir community should be viewed as a voluntary amalgamation throughout the centuries between indigenous mostly Nubian groups, descendants of emigrating Arabs and recruited tribal minorities living among them or in the adjoining areas. By recognizing a common genealogical pedigree, all members of the tribe establish a system of mutual respect, rights and obligations, thereby uniting themselves in their claims for land and other resources against neighbouring tribes.\nVarying detailed charts of their genealogy can be studied in SALIH (1999:20) and TAIYEB (1969:between 4-5).\n\nThe current Manasir clans are divided into Riverain Manasir (Manasir al-Nil, مناصير النيل) and Bedouin Manasir (Manasir al-Badiyah, مناصير البادية), (cf. TAIYEB 1969:2).\nDuring the dry season some clans migrate to the desert area of the Kababish tribe to the west (Khala' Kabushiyah, خلاء كبوشية) others to the grazing grounds of Wad Hamid (بادية ود حامد) in the Ga'ali Country (الجعليين) or to the Rubatab (الرباطاب) Country. (cf. LAGNAH 1969:3, TAIYEB 1969:2)\nThe de facto population of the Manasir (in the Shiri Rural Council) in 1993 had been 30,000, according to data of The Federal Department of Statistics of Sudan cited and empirically verified by SALIH (1999:10-11). The publication of the Manasir committee is talking about 33,000 residents and 17,000 non-resident Manasir (تعداد السكان المقيمين فى 92/1993 م=33.000 نسمة, تعداد الاسر المترددة فى92/1993 م=17.000 نسمة), (LAGNAH 2005:6).\nBoth figures remain vague and don't specify to what extent they include the Bedouin Manasir in the Bayudah Desert.\n\nLike other tribes in Sudan, most Manasir of the grown-up generations have tribal marks (Shilukh, الشلوخ) which possibly originate from a Sheikh's animal burning mark (Wasm, وسم). The tribal marks are cut with a razor on the cheeks of a child to mark it belonging to a specific tribe. Among the Donqolawi and the Shaiqiya these marks usually consist of three horizontal scars, among the Rubatab and the Ga'aliin the lines are vertical, the scars in the case of the Rubatab being rather larger and closer together (cf. CROWFOOT 131–132). The Manasir do not have a unique design of tribal marks, but copy either the upstream or downstream neighbouring tribes.\n\nThe riverain Manasir pursue small scale agriculture on alluvial soils in the immediate vicinity of the Nile. Their most important cash crop sold on the national market is a wide variety of dates (cf. Date Cultivation in Dar al-Manasir). They are also renowned for their skill in building mud houses (Galus, جالوص) and they used to float wood from the region of Atbarah (cf. TAIYEB 1969:3, SALIH 1999:152).\n\nTheir material culture is simple and consists mainly of a variety of storage containers and tools (cf. Material Culture of the Manasir). An insight into their culture and perception can be obtained by studying the of their recent poet Ibrahim 'Ali Salman.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1983742", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1983742", "title": "Greg Gagne (wrestler)", "text": "Greg Gagne (wrestler)\n\nGregory Alan \"Greg\" Gagne (born July 27, 1948) is a retired American professional wrestler. He is the son of Verne Gagne. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, he achieved his biggest success as one half of the tag team The High Flyers with Jim Brunzell. The High Flyers enjoyed a number of high-profile feuds within the American Wrestling Association (AWA) with the likes of Bobby Duncum and Blackjack Lanza, Pat Patterson and Ray \"The Crippler\" Stevens, The East-West Connection (Adrian Adonis and Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura), and The Sheiks (Ken Patera and Jerry Blackwell).\n\nGagne started wrestling in 1972 in his father's promotion, the American Wrestling Association (AWA). Gagne formed the team The High Flyers with Jim Brunzell, and on July 7, 1977 they defeated Duncum and Lanza to win the AWA World Tag Team Championship. The Flyers successfully defended the title in rematches with the former champions as well as other contenders within the AWA ranks for nearly 15 months before they had to vacate the title due to an injury that Jim Brunzell sustained while playing in a charity softball game. The title was awarded to Pat Patterson and Ray Stevens in late September 1978. The Flyers regained the title in June 1981 from The East-West Connection (Adrian Adonis and Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura). The Flyers held the title for a little more than two years before dropping it to Ken Patera and Jerry Blackwell on June 26, 1983. Though the Flyers came close to regaining the title on several occasions, they never recaptured it. The team parted ways shortly thereafter, with Gagne entering into singles competition while Brunzell worked frequently as both a singles and tag team wrestler before departing for the World Wrestling Federation in 1985.\n\nFrom 1984 to 1986, Gagne was involved in a feud with Sheik Adnan Al-Kaissie's army, which at the time included King Kong Brody. The feud also saw Greg's retired father Verne return briefly for a number of matches. The David vs. Goliath feel to the Brody/Gagne feud boosted attendance at the time, a trend that might have continued, giving the AWA a much needed shot in the arm. Before the feud could be marketed to its full potential, Brody left the AWA. Meanwhile, in 1985, Gagne began an ill-fated and short-lived metamorphosis, becoming a member of Sgt. Slaughter's Cobra Corps. The idea saw a fatigues-clad Gagne teaming with Slaughter.\n\nIn the later 1980s, Gagne feuded with Curt Hennig, Ron Garvin, and Larry Zbyszko and briefly resurrected his feud with Sheik Adnan Al-Kaissie. His feud with Hennig over the AWA title only heated up when both fathers, Verne and Larry Hennig, became embroiled in the feud interfering on behalf of their sons during many of their matches. Gagne apparently won the title on several occasions only to have the belt returned to Hennig on technicality, à la the Dusty finish.\n\nIt was during this time that the AWA created the AWA International Television Championship. Gagne defeated Adrian Adonis in a tournament to be crowned the first TV champion. Ron Garvin defeated Gagne for the TV title in the fall of 1988, hitting Gagne with a foreign object to get the pin. The belt was held up until a showdown at SuperClash III. Gagne won the belt back as the result of a count out.\n\nAfter SuperClash III, the AWA stripped Jerry Lawler of the World Title (Lawler eventually left the AWA and competed in the USWA as that federation's World champion). It was then decided that the new champion would be determined in a battle royal in February 1989. Many fans expected either Gagne or Slaughter to win the title that night and the crowd reacted with shock when both were eliminated late in the match. The crowd was even more stunned when Larry Zbyszko became the new champion by eliminating Tom Zenk to end the match. Gagne challenged Larry Zbyszko for the AWA World Heavyweight Championship at \"War in the Windy City\", but was unsuccessful. It was also around this time the Sheik Adnan Al-Kaissie attacked Verne Gagne during an interview. As a result, Gagne turned his attention to Adnan in a feud that eventually involved a young Kokina Maximus. Gagne's wrestling career ended during a match for the vacated AWA World Tag Team Title. Gagne and Paul Diamond were facing The Destruction Crew in the finals when Adnan and Kokina came to the ring and confronted Gagne. Kokina slammed Gagne on the cement floor outside the ring and then splashed his leg, apparently doing damage to Gagne's knee. Gagne retired due to the injury and began to work in the broadcast booth and in production. Publicly, he enlisted the help of Jerry Blackwell to exact revenge on Adnan and Kokina. Despite the build up, the match never occurred.\n\nFollowing an ongoing exodus of talent and the disastrous Team Challenge Series, the AWA became inactive in late 1990. The Gagnes made an attempt to revive the AWA in May 1991, but were unsuccessful. Gagne teamed with Wahoo McDaniel to face the Destruction Crew in the main event of the last AWA show promoted by Verne Gagne in May 1991. After the AWA closed for good, Gagne worked as a road agent for World Championship Wrestling for a couple of years. While working for his father's AWA, Gagne received $100,000 in workman's compensation benefits. This money would later play a role in his bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nThough despite working the majority of his career for his father's promotion, Gagne made some rare appearances in the then World Wrestling Federation, current day WWE.\n\nGagne's first appearance in the WWF (at that time under the \"World Wide Wrestling Federation \"WWWF\"\" banner) was in 1977, in a match for WWWF TV-Tapings at Madison Square Garden, where he defeated Johnny Rodz.\n\nGagne's second appearance in the WWF was in April 24, 1980, where he defeated preliminary wrestler Jose Estrada in a match for WWF-TV Tapings at MSG.\n\nGagne's third and final appearance in the WWF was at the Showdown at Shea event in August 9, 1980, where he defeated Rick McGraw.\n\nApart from the WWF, Gagne made some other rare appearances in other territories, though many of these appearances would be the result of the AWA exchanging their talent with other promotions.\n\nIn 1976, Gagne would make his first appearance in wrestling outside his father's promotion, appearing at a Central States Wrestling event, where Gagne teamed up with Pat O' Connor to take on the team of Baron von Raschke and Ernie Ladd.\n\nGagne's final appearance in CSW was when Gagne teamed up with Jim Brunzell to defeat the team of Bennie Ramirez and Moose Morowski.\n\nGagne would make multiple appearances through the course of 1977 and 1978 at NWA St. Louis Wrestling and Maple Leaf Wrestling, where he often would be paired up with Jim Brunzell to defend their AWA World Tag Team Titles.\n\nGagne would later appear in the Memphis-based Continental Wrestling Association, where he and Brunzell would successfully defend their titles against the team of Frankie Laine and Mike Boyer.\n\nThrough the course of 1982 and 1984, Gagne would often travel to Japan and make appearances for All Japan Pro Wrestling, where he would team with Jim Brunzell as well.\n\nOn May 11, 1984, Gagne and Brunzell appeared at a Georgia Championship Wrestling event, where they defeated the team of Jimmy Duke and Rooster Griffin.\n\nOn September 19, 1985, Gagne appeared at a Jim Crockett Promotions event, where he teamed up with Sgt. Slaughter (as Brunzell by the time left the AWA for the WWF) to take on the team of Nick Bockwinkel and Larry Zbyszko. Bockwinkel and Zbyszko would win the match by disqualification.\n\nGagne's last appearance outside the AWA would come in 1988, at a CWA event, where he defeated Terry Adonis.\n\nGagne played football at the University of Minnesota from 1967–1969. He transferred to the University of Wyoming in 1970 where he played ten games as quarterback.\n\nGagne appeared in the 1974 movie, \"The Wrestler\". He also made a brief appearance in the movie \"Highlander\" during the opening scene at Madison Square Garden.\n\nGreg was married to Mary Gail Gagne and has three children. Mary Gail Gagne died on March 29, 2019. Greg inducted his father, Verne Gagne, into the WWE Hall of Fame on April 1, 2006.\n\nWhen his run with WCW was over, he sold Mitsubishi cars in Minnesota. On April 30, 2006, it was announced that Gagne would be working for World Wrestling Entertainment full-time as a road agent, starting at Backlash. He also worked at WWE's training camp Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). He later parted ways with WWE. He runs a small commodity trading fund on behalf of retired AWA talent. In addition, in 2009, Gagne opened a professional wrestling school in Mound, Minnesota. He has also coached football.\n\n"}
{"id": "1983762", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1983762", "title": "Tom Hagen", "text": "Tom Hagen\n\nThomas Hagen is a fictional character in Mario Puzo's 1969 novel \"The Godfather\" and Francis Ford Coppola's films \"The Godfather\" (1972) and \"The Godfather Part II\" (1974). He is portrayed by Robert Duvall in the films. He also appears in the Mark Winegardner sequel novels, \"The Godfather Returns\" and \"The Godfather's Revenge\", as well as Ed Falco's novel, \"The Family Corleone.\"\n\nHe operates as the \"consigliere\" and as a lawyer for the Corleone family, and is an informally adopted member of the family.\n\nHagen is the informally adopted son of the mafia boss Don Vito Corleone. He is a qualified lawyer and the \"consigliere\" to the Corleone American mafia family. Logical and gentle, he serves as the voice of reason within the family. The novel and first film establish that he is of German-Irish ancestry.\n\nSonny Corleone befriends 11-year-old Tom, who was living on the street after running away from an orphanage. When Sonny brings Tom home and demands he be taken in, the Corleone family welcome him as a family member. Hagen considers Vito his true father, although Vito never formally adopts him, believing it would be disrespectful to Hagen's deceased parents.\n\nAfter law school, Hagen goes to work in the Corleone family business. His non-Italian ancestry precludes his formal membership in the mafia family, but when the \"consigliere\" Genco Abbandando dies, Hagen is given his position. Consequently, the other New York families deride the Corleones as \"The Irish Gang\".\n\nHagen immerses himself in the Sicilian-American culture and speaks fluent Sicilian. His Northern European appearance, though distracting to the Five Families, is an advantage to his job. He is able to travel and conduct family business in non-Italian circles without potential witnesses noticing him.\n\nWhile Hagen is close to all the Corleones, he respects Sonny the most and blames himself for Sonny's murder. When Vito semi-retires in 1954 and his youngest son Michael Corleone succeeds him as the head of the family, Michael removes Hagen as \"consigliere\", preferring his father informally assume the role; Michael claims Hagen is \"not a wartime consigliere\". Hagen is thus restricted to handling the family's legitimate business.\n\nThe novel and first film portray Hagen aiding Vito and Michael Corleone in warring against the other ruling New York Mafia families. In \"The Godfather Part II\", set in 1958–1959, Hagen serves as Michael's right-hand man during his power struggle with Hyman Roth. In \"The Godfather Part III\", set in 1979–1980, he is said to have died some years before in an unspecified manner. His role in the story between the second and third films, including his death, is portrayed in Mark Winegardner's sequel novels, \"The Godfather Returns\" and \"The Godfather's Revenge\".\n\nIn both the novel and film, Hagen is introduced as an important member of the Corleone family. As a child he grew up in a broken family, the son of an abusive alcoholic. Sonny Corleone finds the orphaned Hagen living on the street and suffering from an eye infection, takes him home, and demands he live with the Corleone family. Vito Corleone becomes a surrogate father to Hagen, but never officially adopts him out of respect for the boy's biological father.\n\nIn the novel, Hagen asks to work for Vito after graduating from law school, knowing full well that his adoptive father is the most powerful Mafia chief in the nation. Vito is happy to employ Hagen into his empire, having often said that lawyers can steal more than a phalanx of gangsters. Hagen marries an Italian woman, Theresa, with whom he has two sons, Frank and Andrew, and a daughter, Gianna.\n\nAfter Vito's longtime \"consigliere\" Genco Abbandando is diagnosed with cancer, Hagen becomes acting \"consigliere\" and succeeds to the post formally after Abbandando's death. Vito is initially reluctant to give Hagen the post full-time, considering Hagen is not a Sicilian.\n\nWhen famous singer/actor Johnny Fontane seeks his godfather Vito's help in securing a movie role that could revitalize his fading career, Vito sends Hagen, accompanied by some of his caporegimes, to Hollywood to persuade Jack Woltz, a successful movie producer, to cast Johnny in his new war film. Hagen offers his benefactor's help with Woltz's union problems and also informs him that one of his actors has been using marijuana and heroin; a deleted scene in the movie shows that this information would be used to damage Woltz's studio. Woltz rebuffs Hagen but becomes friendly after learning he works for the Corleones. Woltz still refuses to cast Fontane, who slept with one of Woltz's protégées, but offers to do any other favor for Vito, expressing his intent to run Fontane out of the entertainment industry as retaliation for his affair. Hagen declines, and soon afterward, Woltz awakens in bed with his prized racing stallion's severed head planted under the covers, scaring him into casting Fontane in the film.\n\nTom arranges a meeting between Vito and drug kingpin Virgil Sollozzo. Sollozzo wants Vito to help finance his narcotics business and provide legal protection and political influence. Sollozzo commends Hagen for discovering that Sollozzo is also collaborating with the Tattaglia Family, a rival to the Corleones. Vito ultimately rejects the deal, however, on the grounds that Vito would lose his influence over the judges and police if they knew he was in the drug trade.\n\nOffended at the rejection of his deal, Sollozzo has Luca Brasi murdered, Vito shot, and Hagen kidnapped off the street. Sollozzo informs Hagen that Vito has been shot and killed outside his office and tasks Hagen to persuade Sonny to make peace and accept his narcotics deal. Hagen says he'll do his best but warns Sollozzo that Luca Brasi, the Don's most loyal bodyguard and hitman, will launch a violent reprisal. Unbeknownst to Hagen, Sollozzo and Bruno Tattaglia have already murdered Brasi, a murder of which Sollozzo feigns ignorance. The meeting is interrupted when Sollozzo receives word that Vito has survived the shooting, ruining Sollozzo's original plan. It's a testament to Hagen's persuasive nature that he manages to convince Sollozzo to allow him to leave unharmed, having convinced Sollozzo that he'll still make the narcotics deal for him with the Corleones.\n\nTom meets with Sonny, Michael, and Corleone \"caporegimes\" Peter Clemenza and Salvatore Tessio, and advises that if Vito dies, Sonny should agree to Sollozzo's deal, and that the other Mafia families will most likely support Sollozzo to avoid a long, savage war. Two fish wrapped in Luca Brasi's bulletproof vest arrive at the Corleone compound, an unmistakable message that Brasi has been murdered by Sollozzo. Sonny orders Clemenza to execute Vito's possibly traitorous bodyguard Paulie Gatto; Clemenza, accompanied by \"soldato\" (and later caporegime) Rocco Lampone, has Gatto drive out to a wheat field, and exits the car to urinate as Lampone shoots and kills Gatto.\n\nAfter Michael thwarts a second assassination attempt on Vito by Sollozzo, he calls the Corleone compound to warn Sonny. Tom goes to the hospital with private detectives that are licensed to carry firearms to protect Vito and stops Captain Mark McCluskey, a corrupt NYPD official on Sollozzo's payroll, from taking Michael into police custody. Sonny then orders Bruno Tattaglia, son and underboss of Sollozzo's ally Philip Tattaglia, to be murdered. Sollozzo requests a meeting and proposes that Michael be sent to broker a truce. Sonny, believing it is a trick, refuses and demands that the other Mafia families hand over Sollozzo to the Corleone family or else face war. Tom successfully convinces Sonny to wait because McCluskey has agreed to be Sollozzo's bodyguard and warns Sonny that killing McCluskey would violate a long-standing Mafia rule to not kill members of law enforcement. Violation of the rule would cause harmful backlash from rival Mafia families and law enforcement. Michael suggests they agree to Sollozzo's meeting but insist it be held in a public place, to lull Sollozzo into a feeling of safety. Michael devises a plan: he will kill McCluskey and Sollozzo and then have journalists on the Corleone payroll run stories about McCluskey's ties to drug trafficking operations, which will convince the other families not to retaliate on the grounds of McCluskey's corruption. Sonny agrees and approves the hit.\n\nTom is nervous about putting Michael at risk but Sonny discovers the location of the meeting, an Italian restaurant, from a policeman on the Corleone payroll in McCluskey's precinct. Clemenza plants a revolver behind a toilet tank in the restaurant's bathroom, which Michael retrieves before returning to his table and shooting both men dead. The killing of Sollozzo and McCluskey and the subsequent Mafia war between the Corleone family and the Five Families sparks a massive crackdown by law enforcement. Michael hides in Sicily and Vito returns home. Tom informs Vito that the police have cracked down on all Mafia operations. Tom informs Vito that it was Michael who killed Sollozzo and McCluskey and thus had to flee. As the impulsive Sonny takes command of the Corleone family while his father recovers, Tom advises peace while Sonny is eager for revenge. Impatient with Tom's rationality, Sonny lashes out and belittles Tom's abilities as a wartime consigliere, but immediately apologizes.\n\nTom again acts as intermediary when Michael's fiancée Kay Adams arrives at the Corleone compound wanting to contact Michael. Tom denies knowledge of Michael's whereabouts and refuses her letter. Tom advises she be patient and that Michael will eventually contact her.\n\nConnie's husband, Carlo Rizzi, helps Corleone rival Emilio Barzini set a trap for Sonny by savagely assaulting a pregnant Connie, which he knows will inspire protective Sonny to immediately leave the Corleone compound in a hurry and without protection, to kill him. Barzini has set up an ambush for Sonny at the Long Beach Causeway toll plaza, and gun him down before Sonny's bodyguards are able to catch up.\n\nTom is distraught over Sonny's murder and tearfully informs Vito of his son's death. Tom accompanies Vito to the funeral home of Amerigo Bonasera, where Vito has Bonasera repair Sonny's body prior to his funeral. Vito orders no retaliation for Sonny's murder and has Tom organize a meeting with the other Mafia bosses to end the war. Vito makes peace with Philip Tattaglia and gives his word he won't break the peace. After the meeting Tom asks Vito about the drug middlemen having clean records when he meets with the Tattaglia family but Vito corrects him saying Tattaglia was a pimp that never could've beaten Sonny and that it was Emilio Barzini who masterminded Sonny's murder.\n\nVito semi-retires in 1954 and Michael becomes operating head of the family. Michael removes Hagen as \"consigliere\" in favor of having Vito fill the position, restricting Tom to handling the family's legal business in Nevada, Chicago, and Los Angeles. Michael and Vito explain that the Corleones risk inciting a fight with the planned move to Nevada, and they need a \"wartime consigliere\". Tom accepts the decision and remains loyal but is emotionally scarred. In truth, Michael and Vito have been secretly continuing Sonny's plan to wipe out the other New York Dons that will establish the Corleone family as the most powerful crime family in the country. Vito explains he advised Michael on removing Tom as consigliere and although Vito considered Tom a good consigliere and like Michael has all of Vito's confidence, there are reasons why Tom must not have any part of the plan, and Tom accepts the decision. In the novel (and in a deleted scene from the film), Tom notices that bodyguard Rocco Lampone has been secretly promoted to \"caporegime\" and hitman Al Neri reports directly to Michael and rather than through Clemenza and Tessio. Vito reminds Michael that he warned him these details wouldn't escape Tom's attention.\n\nTom is present when Tessio is taken away to be executed for betraying the family and is also present when Carlo is garroted and murdered by Clemenza for his complicity in Sonny's death years earlier. Although Tom is used to violence and accepts that treachery is never forgiven, in the novel he feels sickened by Tessio's imminent death and had even asked if Tessio could be spared.\n\nIn the novel, Michael's wife, Kay learns that Michael ordered his brother-in-law Carlo's death and flees to her parents' home in New Hampshire. Michael sends Tom there to persuade Kay to return. Tom ultimately risks his own life by \"hypothetically\" revealing some family secrets to Kay so she can understand Michael's motives.\n\nIn \"The Godfather Part II\", Hagen remains Michael's lawyer after their move to Nevada, but his role in the family has been reduced. For instance, he is excluded from the negotiations with Hyman Roth to legitimize the Corleone family by going into business with Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista. After an assassination attempt is made on Michael's life, Michael realizes he cannot trust anyone in his inner circle. Assuring their fraternal bond and explaining that he withholds information from him out of admiration, Michael proclaims Hagen acting Don while he leaves and attempts to uncover his betrayer. Hagen's promotion marks his renewed influence in the family and secures the formerly abrasive Senator Pat Geary's forced cooperation.\n\nThe fall of Batista's regime in Cuba forces Michael to temporarily abandon his plans to become a legitimate businessman, and he resumes his role as the Don of the Corleone family. During the Senate hearings on the Mafia, Hagen is instrumental as the defense when Michael is interrogated. Near the end of the film, Hagen is unable to disguise his displeasure over Michael's increasing ruthlessness and paranoia, questioning the need to kill an already dying Hyman Roth. In response, Michael confronts Hagen about his competing job offers, and obliquely threatens to inform Hagen's wife about his mistress. Challenged point blank to confirm his loyalty to the Corleone Family, Hagen responds to Michael (in Sicilian) that he remains loyal. He dutifully fulfills his role as legal adviser, and also in the \"consigliere\"s traditional role as dispassionate family envoy. He gives Frank Pentangeli, who had betrayed Michael, the \"idea\" of committing suicide so that Pentangeli's family will be taken care of, while agreeing with Pentangeli that at one point the Corleone Family \"was like the Roman Empire\".\n\nIn a deleted subplot, Sonny's widow Sandra Corleone becomes Tom's mistress, a fact that Michael uses to blackmail Hagen into remaining loyal despite Sandra urging Hagen to abandon the Corleone family.\n\nAccording to \"The Godfather Part III\", Hagen has already died before the time frame of the film, which is 1979–1980. There is no specific indication in the film as to when or how he died, except that it was prior to his son, Andrew, being ordained a Roman Catholic priest.\n\nHagen was originally intended to have been featured in \"The Godfather Part III\", but was written out due to a salary dispute between Duvall and the film's producers. Coppola has stated that \"Part III\" was to feature a split between Michael and Hagen as its central plot, as seeds of dissension were planted in the first two films.\n\nCoppola stated in the film's commentary that Duvall demanded the same salary as Al Pacino (who portrayed Michael Corleone). However, Duvall said in an interview that he was happy for Pacino to earn twice his salary, but not triple or quadruple it for the same film.\n\n\"The Godfather Returns\", Mark Winegardner's 2004 sequel to Puzo's original novel, portrays Hagen's role as \"consigliere\" in the first few years after Michael ascends to the head of the family. The novel, which covers the period from 1955–1962, portrays Hagen once again acting as Michael's right-hand adviser and taking an important role in the Corleones' dealings with a powerful political family, the Sheas (analogous to the Kennedys). Hagen makes a deal with patriarch Mickey Shea that the Corleone family would help get his son, James, elected President on condition that his youngest son, Danny, the new attorney general, would take a soft stance on organized crime. Meanwhile, Hagen has sights on a political career, running for a Congressional seat in Nevada (which Hagen was initially appointed to) with the ultimate goal of becoming the state's governor; he is badly defeated, however, and abandons any hopes of holding public office.\n\nThe novel also portrays Hagen covering up for Michael's brother Fredo when he kills a man in San Francisco, and bailing him out of jail when he attacks his wife's lover. Hagen and Fredo get into an intense argument over Fredo's recklessness and Hagen's blind loyalty to Michael. When Michael has Fredo killed (as originally portrayed in \"The Godfather Part II\"), Hagen guesses what really happened, but remains willfully ignorant.\nToward the end of the novel, Hagen personally murders Corleone rival Louie Russo, who conspired with the novel's antagonist, traitorous Corleone \"caporegime\" Nick Geraci.\n\nIn Winegardner's 2006 novel \"The Godfather's Revenge\", Hagen acts as Michael's right-hand man in dealing with the Shea family, especially Attorney General Danny Shea, who publicly declares war on organized crime. When Hagen's longtime mistress, Judy Buchanan, is murdered by thugs working for Don Carlo Tramonti, Hagen becomes a person of interest in the investigation, though he is later cleared of the charges.\n\nIn August 1964, Geraci kidnaps Hagen and drowns him in the Florida Everglades. Geraci then sends Michael a package containing a dead baby alligator along with Hagen's wallet. This message is similar to the one Sonny received following Luca Brasi's death, in which Brasi's bulletproof vest containing two dead fish was delivered to the Corleone compound. Michael later has Geraci ambushed and murdered.\n\nThe novel also expands on how Hagen became an unofficial member of the Corleone family. Hagen recalls that when he was living on the streets, he saved Sonny Corleone from a pimp who was notorious for raping and murdering boys. Sonny was so grateful that he brought Hagen home to live with his family.\n\nEdward Falco's \"The Family Corleone\", which takes place before the events of \"The Godfather\", expands upon Tom Hagen joining the Corleone family crime business and becoming the family's \"consigliere\".\n\n\n"}
