The poem relates that somewhere in Sweden, probably Värmland, they arrived at a place called \"Hof\". The door was shut, and the people were hostile. They said that the farm was holy and that they were not welcome. Sigvatr cursed them by saying \"may the Trolls take you\".

Formerly a member of Vietnam's Communist party, she was expelled from the party in 1989, and has been denied the right to travel abroad, and was temporarily imprisoned for her writings and outspoken criticism of corruption in the Vietnamese government.\n\nBorn in 1947 in Thái Bình a province in northern Vietnam, Dương came of age just as the Vietnam War was turning violent. At the age of twenty, when she was a student at Vietnamese Ministry of Culture’s Arts College, Dương Thu Hương volunteered to serve in a women’s youth brigade on the front lines of \"The War Against the Americans\". Dương spent the next seven years of the war in the jungles and tunnels of \"Bình Trị Thiên\", the most heavily bombarded region of the war. Her mission was to \"sing louder than the bombs\" and to give theatrical performances for the North Vietnamese troops, but also to tend to the wounded, bury the dead, and accompany the soldiers along. She was one of three survivors out of the forty volunteers in that group. She was also at the front during China’s attacks on Vietnam in 1979 during the short-lived Sino-Vietnamese War. \nHowever, in the period after Vietnam’s reunification in 1975, Dương became increasingly outspoken and critical about the repressive atmosphere created by the Communist government. Upon seeing the conditions in the South – compared with the North – she began speaking out against the communist government.\n\nHer first novels, \"Journey in Childhood\" (\"Hành trình ngày thơ ấu\", 1985), \"Beyond Illusions\" (\"Bên kia bờ ảo vọng\", 1987), \"Paradise of the Blind\" (\"Những thiên đường mù\", 1988) and \"The Lost Life\" (\"Quãng đời đánh mất\", 1989) were published in her native Vietnam and soon became bestsellers in Vietnam before they were banned. The third one was also the first Vietnamese novel ever published in the United States in English. Her next three books — \"Novel Without a Name\" (\"Tiểu thuyết vô đề\", 1991), \"Memories of a Pure Spring\" (2000), and \"No Man's Land\" (\"Chốn vắng\", 2002) — have not been published in the United States. She was made a Chevalier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government (1994). She earlier wrote a number of short stories and screenplays. One story, \"Reflections of Spring,\" was translated by Linh Dinh and included in the anthology, \"Night, Again: Contemporary Fiction from Vietnam\" (Seven Stories Press 2006).\nThe latest novel \"No Man's Land\" (\"Terre des oublis\" in French, which won the Grand prix des lectrices de Elle (2007)), perhaps her most successful, was in the final list of the prize Femina 2006 and received the Grand prix des lectrices de \"Elle\" in 2007.\n\nDương has been labeled as a \"dissident writer\" and been expelled by Vietnam’s Communist party and was imprisoned for a short time in 1991 for remarks criticizing the goals and interests of the party and its members. This is not unusual in contemporary Vietnam; Linh Dinh, in his introduction to the collection \"Night, Again\", details the government’s extreme response to certain subjects in writing – for example, in 1956, the poet Tran Dan was arrested for capitalizing \"He\" in a brief passage of a poem cataloging social despair, since such a designation was reserved for Ho Chi Minh. In 1991, Le Minh Khue was still criticized for having a North Vietnamese female soldier daydream about the smile of a handsome South Vietnamese prisoner of war.\n\nThough she was one of Vietnam’s most popular writers, most of her fiction is published outside of Vietnam due to both the censorship and the government’s monopoly of the publishing industry.\n\nRecently, she has retired and earns a pension of approximately twenty U.S. dollars per month and must earn her living working as a translator and trying to publish her novels and short stories abroad. She believes in struggling to gain democracy; while unable to run for political office or organize a competing party, she now uses writing in order to articulate that message.\n\nIn her story \"The Story of an Actress,\" Dương combines her passionate beliefs about human freedom with her existentialist literary sensibilities. Bê and Thom live next door to one another and become best friends; while Bê is intelligent and fun-loving, Thom develops into the town beauty. Thom ends up marrying the most famous theater director in Vietnam, a man 40 years her senior, in an attempt to become an actress; Bê visits her and watches her life disintegrate as she works toward her degree and her own life dream.\n\nOn the surface, it seems to be a relatively simple story about two girls growing up and choosing different paths in life. But her language and details betray, as with Ho Xuan Huong, a deeper level to a simple story. She is critiquing a contemporary society where beauty is prized over intellect and money over kindness, and calling attention to how the optimism of youth, when it fades, can be so devastating that it drives people to despair.\n\nAccording to Dương, most writers must learn how to voice their individual concerns within a group mentality. In other words, their writing must reflect the individual and the masses at large in a way that's approved by the party; Dương finds that most writers in contemporary Vietnam get caught up in the group thinking mentality.\n\nDương has felt the effects of censorship perhaps more cruelly than many of her fellow writers. Her work is not contained in any Vietnamese anthologies or collections. Though she has achieved success and renown abroad for her novels through translation, the audience she is writing for in Vietnam, that would most understand the minutiae of her stories, does not often have the opportunity to read her work, except when it is smuggled into Vietnam.\n\nNevertheless, Dương is hopeful for the future of writing in her country. She is counting on the fact that at some point, the people will open their eyes to see what's going on in her homeland.\n\nDương moved to Paris in 2006. In January 2009, her latest novel, \"Đỉnh Cao Chói Lọi\", was published; it was also translated into French as \"Au zénith\".\n\n\n\n"}

He founded the Australian logistics company Linfox in 1956, and is now non-executive chairman. Linfox is Australia's largest privately held logistics company, with more than 5,000 trucks across ten countries throughout the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nLindsay Fox was brought up in Prahran, a suburb of Melbourne. He was educated at Melbourne High School, but was asked to leave during Year 10, at age 16, due to his lack of academic interest. He started working as a truck driver and was able to use this as a springboard to found Linfox. He has since visited Melbourne High School on numerous formal occasions.\n\nFor many of his earlier years, Lindsay Fox played Australian rules football with moderate success, and he continues his involvement with the sport.\n\nRecruited from the St Kilda Football Club's thirds side (which he captained), Fox was sent to Golden Point Football Club in the Ballarat Football League before he returned to make his Victorian Football League debut in 1960. Fox did not think much of his footballing abilities, but as a ruckman he went on to play 20 games (for 3 goals) between 1959 and 1961. Following his stint in the VFL, he went to the VFA, playing firstly for Moorabbin, where he won a premiership, and then for Brighton-Caulfield, where he moved after Moorabbin's expulsion from the Association.\n\nHe later returned in an administrative role, becoming the president of the Saints in 1979.\n\nFox started Linfox in 1956 with one truck.\n\nHe also took ownership of Melbourne's Luna Park in late 2005. In 2006, he made an unsuccessful bid for the development of the neighboring 'Triangle Site' on St Kilda's foreshore. The property was subsequently destroyed by fire.\n\nHe has been involved with a number of high-profile disputes with the Government relating to his property development activities. In the late 1990s he attempted to claim the public beach area in front of his holiday home as a private helipad for his helicopter and to build a high security compound for himself and his family. This development was rejected by the Victorian Planning Minister. However he has also been able to use his government contacts to gain favorable treatment by being granted permission to land his helicopter near his Portsea home on crown land.\n\nFox has been in dispute with the local council of his mansion by attempting to have the heritage listing that applies to all homes in the street removed from his property. His son's Toorak home was destroyed by fire.\n\nFox has been married for fifty years, with six children.\n\nIn 2004 on the ABC TV \"George Negus Tonight\" program, Fox's work ethic and business savviness was profiled. When asked by George Negus how he describes himself politically, Fox replied: \"I guess, Labor think I'm Liberal, Liberal think I'm Labor, the Catholics think I'm Protestant, the Protestants think I'm Catholic. The local rabbi delivers me matse. So I guess, bottom line, I'm an Australian\". Fox went on to say: \"I, traditionally, probably, was brought up in a working-class family where the old man would turn in his grave if he'd thought I'd have voted Liberal. But I must admit, from probably 25 up to the last election, I would have voted Liberal and supported Liberal quite strongly. But I was completely disillusioned by the lack of statesmanship with our Prime Minister with the Ansett debacle. He had an opportunity to be a statesman. Instead he took on a political role and as a result of that, the demise of Ansett came about\".\n\nFollowing the suicide of his son Michael in 1991, Fox advised the Federal and Victorian governments on youth suicide and is on the board of the National Advisory Council on Suicide Prevention. In 1992 he was named \"Victorian Father of the Year\". In an interview with George Negus in August 2004, Fox spoke of the loss of his son: \"Well, life is about being up and being down and being able to get up again. And in my walks of life, I guess I thought I was invincible till one of my sons committed suicide. And at that point of time, I knew I wasn't invincible ... I'd give up everything if we could get Michael back. He's got a special place in each and every one of the hearts of our family and he'll always be there and he'll never grow old.\"\n\nFox was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia in the Australia Day Honours' List of 1992, in recognition of service to the transport industry and to the community. In 2001, he was awarded the Centenary Medal. In 2008, Fox was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC), in recognition of his continued service to the transport and logistics industries, to business through the development and promotion of youth traineeships, and to the community through a range of philanthropic endeavours.\n\nIn 2019, \"The Australian Financial Review\" assessed Fox's net worth at A$3.31 billion, listed on the 2019 Rich List. Fox is one of thirteen living individuals listed on every \"Financial Review Rich List\" since the first list was published in 1984. Meanwhile, in 2015 \"Forbes\" assessed his net worth at 2.90 billion, on the list of Australia's 50 Richest people.\n"}

It is located north of the City of Ensenada and southeast of the border crossing from San Diego to Tijuana. It includes communities such as Ejido El Porvenir, Francisco Zarco, San Antonio de las Minas and Colonia Articulo 115, and combined had 5,859 inhabitants according to the 2010 census.\n\nThe community was founded in 1834 by Dominican missionary Félix Caballero as Misión de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe del Norte, making it the last mission established in the Californias. Caballero had to abandon the mission in 1840, under attacks from the indigenous peoples.\n\nFrom 1905–1910, a mixture of Spiritual Christian faiths, mostly \"Pryguny\" from Transcaucasia, South Russia, settled in 4 farming colonies near Ensenada, Baja California Norte Territory, Mexico. Guadalupe was the main colony of about 20+ square miles purchased in 1905. Most owned or rented land communally. Not all were ethnic Russians, and were of various folk-Protestant (non-Orthodox) faiths. A few Russian Orthodox immigrants, had no priest or church, lived in Ensenada and were confused with the Spiritual Christians. \n\nTo make land and loan payments, paid in wheat, the settlers rented as much as 50 square miles from about 10 nearby ranches, north to the border. Most moved to California by World War II to join more prosperous relatives and work in the factories. Some intermarried with Spiritual Christian \"Dukh-i-zhizniki\" in California. Most of who remained, intermarried, assimilated and live in Ensenada and Tijuana.\n\nWhen the valley economy shifted to wine-making, the Baja government funded a museum, to preserve the history of the former settlers from Old Russia and enhance wine tourism. Soon two private museums opened, one with a cafe across the street from the state museum, to provide Russian-Mexican dishes for tourists and groups. Roads are improved with asphalt paving to accommodate wine-tour buses.\n\nSince the 1990s the association of winemakers of Baja California holds the Grape Harvest Fiestas in the Valley of Guadalupe and the town of Ensenada every year in August. The celebration includes wine tasting sessions, concerts and soirées, and samplings of regional cuisine and Mexican wines.\n\nWine tasting is available year-round, and several of the wineries have built up-market restaurant/tasting establishments aimed specifically at tourists from the United States. A winery tour is usually included on cruise ships that stop at Ensenada.\n\nThere are over 100 wineries in the Valle de Guadalupe. Some notable wineries in the area include: \n\n\nDiego Hernández heads up Corazón de Tierra, rated by William Reed Business Media (the \"San Pellegrino survey\") as one of Latin America's 50 best restaurants, while chef Javier Plascencia is present with his Finca de Altozano, and Drew Deckman with Deckman's en el Mogor. The area is a center of Baja Med cuisine.\n\nHotels of note include chef Javier Plascencia's Finca la Divina, Bruma, a 200-acre eco-resort including a working winery, 2 villas, and a 8-room hotel, and Encuentro Guadalupe (originally from Grupo Habita, now under other management), whose 20 eco-friendly rooms blend in with the landscape.\n\n\n"}

The story was first published in the Danish \"Anders And & Co.\" #1999-48; the first American publication was in \"Uncle Scrooge\" #334, in October 2004.\n\n\"The Quest for Kalevala\" is based on the Finnish national epic \"Kalevala\", assembled and partly written by Elias Lönnrot in the 19th century. Rosa's inspiration for the story was a Finnish children's book called \"Koirien Kalevala\" (\"The Canine Kalevala\") by the Finnish cartoonist Mauri Kunnas, who was himself inspired by the original \"Kalevala\".\n\nPart of the story takes place in Helsinki, Finland, depicted in an accurate, realistic way as the city looked in the 1950s, though some buildings pictured weren't built until the 1960s.\n\nWhile going through his trunk full of old mementos and souvenirs, Scrooge discovers a page that he remembers having originally torn from one of Lönnrot's notebooks when they met in Scotland in the late 19th century. Huey, Dewey and Louie consult their Junior Woodchucks Guidebook and find out that the notes on the page are part of Lönnrot's notes for the Kalevala and reveal the location of the remains of the Sampo.\n\nUpon hearing of this mythical machine that can produce grain, salt, and most particularly, gold, out of thin air, Scrooge sets out to find it. The Ducks travel to Helsinki, where the director of the Finnish Literature Society explains Lönnrot's notes to them and explains the location marked in them.\n\nThe Ducks travel to the island indicated in the notes, where they find Väinämöinen's legendary sword. Touching the sword awakens the spirit of Väinämöinen, which uses the body of whoever touched the sword as its locus of connection to the mortal world. He tells them what happened to the Sampo during the Kalevala times. Väinämöinen's magic brings Gyro Gearloose to the island, and imbued with Seppo Ilmarinen's spirit, Gyro reassembles the Sampo.\n\nHowever, the Sampo does not work because it is missing a part that was stolen by Louhi, now residing in the afterlife in Tuonela, the underworld. Scrooge and Donald go to Tuonela to retrieve the missing part. However, after they have left, Louhi becomes aware of the return of her ancient enemy and summons Magica De Spell to help her get the Sampo back.\n\nSailing back to continental Finland, Väinämöinen and the Ducks are able to fix the Sampo and start producing gold from thin air. However, Magica De Spell and Louhi attack their ship. In the ensuing battle, Louhi manages to steal Väinämöinen's famous kantele, which holds such great power that she loses interest in the Sampo. As the start of her new reign, Louhi summons the sea monster Iku-Turso and orders it to wreak havoc on Helsinki. Donald goes after Iku-Turso to stop it. In the process, he gets the kantele back and is able to lure Iku-Turso back to the sea.\n\nWith Louhi defeated, Väinämöinen invites Scrooge to come to the lands of Kalevala with him. Scrooge, however, can't bear to lose his family and friends, so he instead abandons the Sampo. Väinämöinen throws Scrooge off the ship and congratulates him on having made the right choice.\n\n\n"}

The band's most prominent lineup consisted of singer and guitarist Amanda Rootes, guitarist Bridget Jones, bassist Helen Storer, and drummer Angie Adams. The band recorded several singles, an EP, and a studio album, \"Black Eye\", in 1996.\n\nThe band formed in 1994 after classmates Amanda Rootes and Angie Adams were inspired by a jazz-blues singer in one of Old Compton Street's gay cafes. They were attending college in London at the time, studying art and design. Guitarist Bridgette Jones did her A levels before joining and the band began rehearsing in Rootes' living room. Fluffy's original bassist was Pandora Ormsby-Gore, but she left the band to become an actress, changing her name to Pandora Colin. Shortly afterwards, Mancunian Helen Storer left Kingston University to join and the band began recording.\n\nFluffy's first singles \"Hypersonic\" and \"Husband\" (both produced by Mal Campbell and Tony Wilson from Freaks of Desire) were released in 1995. The band frequently played shows in their early days at underground fetish balls and parties, such as at Torture Garden and Submission, and gained attention for their raucous shows, performing barefoot in slip dresses. \"Young girls shouldn't be afraid to look feminine…\" Rootes told \"Select\". \"So many girls are afraid to be girls. Apart from Courtney Love, who's really feminine and uses her sexuality and is a strong woman. I don't think women should dress like boys. That's what's great about PJ Harvey. She was boyish and now she's gone really glam. She looks amazing and she's become an icon: a real woman.\"\n\nThey were signed by Dave Stewart of Eurythmics to the publishing side of his label, Anxious Records. Stewart threw a party for the band's first single, \"Hypersonic\". Although Fluffy were initially signed to Parkway Records (owned by press agents Phill Savidge and John Best of Savidge and Best), it was not until A&R man Tom Zutaut signed them to a two-album deal with The Enclave/Hut/Virgin that Fluffy gained wider notoriety. The band appeared on the \"NME\"'s yearly bratbus tour in 1996, along with The Bluetones, The Cardigans, and Heavy Stereo. The band's debut album \"Black Eye\" was released in 1996, and the band supported the Foo Fighters on tour. They were the opening act for the Sex Pistols reunion tour of Japan, as well as the Sex Pistols' first reunion show at Finsbury Park.\n\nFluffy were also the opening band during the European part of Marilyn Manson's 'Anti-Christ Superstar' tour, and toured the US with the Neurotic Outsiders. Their music video for \"Black Eye\" was shot in New Orleans by Floria Sigismondi, and the making of the video was documented by MTV. Their album \"Black Eye\" was produced by Bill Price, who also recorded \"Never Mind the Bollocks\". The band was regularly featured in several magazines: \"Kerrang\", \"Q\", \"Select\", \"NME\", and \"Melody Maker\". They also appeared on several UK television shows, including \"The Big Breakfast\", \"Hotel Babylon\", and \"Top of the Pops\".\n\nFluffy finally split in 1998, when Rootes and Storer moved to Los Angeles, California. Rootes went on to form Harlow, who participated in the VH1 reality television show, \"Bands on the Run\". Storer joined Jessicka's band, Jack Off Jill in 2000 for their final performance, played in Fireball Ministry and also played bass in Duff McKagan's solo band, Loaded, and then formed Thee Heavenly Music Association with guitarist/producer Dave Hillis.

Emile Lecerf, a later editor of the \"Nouvel Europe Magazine\", was one of Thiriart's associates.\n\nFollowing the Algerian War of Independence Thiriart decided to look to a more Europe-wide vision and founded Jeune Europe as a result, calling for a united Europe that would be \"neither Moscow nor Washington\" but rather a third superpower in order that the individual states could stop being squeezed in the Cold War. Jeune Europe quickly grew in influence, with major branches opening in France, Italy and Spain as well as minor groups in nine other countries. Its strongest following was amongst students although it attracted wider attention in part due to the strength of Thiriart's personality and his unusually syncretist message. They also participated in 1962 Conference at Venice, where they agreed to participate in the National Party of Europe, along with Oswald Mosley's Union Movement, Otto Strasser and others. Jeune Europe as a movement, and Thiriart in particular, also foresaw a future rapprochement with the Soviet Union and sought a raproachment with Maoist China in order to oust the Americans from Europe.\n\nAlthough Thiriart publicly disavowed fascism and branded Nazism obsolete the movement was still accused of having a fascist basis, be it through adopting the Celtic cross, a symbol widely used in neo-fascism, as its emblem or advertising the activities of neo-Nazi leader Hans-Ulrich Rudel in its eponymous weekly magazine. The group also maintained links with the network of former SS officers that organised through the magazine \"Nation Europa\". However Thiriart's flirtation with China and the Soviet Union alienated some rank and file members for whom links with fascism were not to be eschewed and when he began to follow a more national communist path and seek contact with Nicolae Ceauşescu membership fell. Other members went in the other direction, notably Renato Curcio, an early member of \"Giovane Europa\" (as the group was called in Italy), who eventually switched allegiance to the communist Red Brigades.\n\nJeune Europe is trying to find allies among the \"peoples oppressed by US imperialism.\" The movement is clearly in favor of the Palestinian cause, and even of North Vietnam. One of its members, Roger Coudroy, who had enlisted in the Palestinian resistance, was the first European to die in a fight between the latter and the Israeli army.\n\nIn 1964, the movement took part in the municipal elections of Brussels. It was dissolved in 1969.\n\n"}
{"id": "2212309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2212309", "title": "Gotlib", "text": "Gotlib\n\nMarcel Gottlieb (14 July 1934 – 4 December 2016), known professionally as Gotlib, was a French comics artist/writer and publisher. Through his own work and the magazines he co-founded, \"L'Écho des savanes\" and \"Fluide Glacial\", he was a key figure in the switch in French-language comics from their children's entertainment roots to an adult tone and readership. His series include \"Rubrique-à-Brac\", \"Gai-Luron\", and \"Superdupont\".\n\nMarcel Gottlieb was born on 14 July 1934 in Paris to parents of Romanian and Hungarian Jewish descent. His father, Ervin, was a house painter and his mother, Regine, a seamstress. In 1942 his father was deported and died at Buchenwald after their building's concierge obligingly helped policemen to find him, a scene which made a strong impression on young Marcel. His mother sent him to hide for the rest of the war on a farm, where he was poorly treated.\n\nAt 17, he left school to work for a pharmaceutical agency while taking art classes in the evening. This led to a job as a letterer at Opera Mundi, a French publisher which translated and published US strips. After his 28-month military service, Gotlib settled as a freelance letterer and illustrator. His first comics were accepted by \"Vaillant\", a magazine for children later renamed \"Pif-Gadget\". His one long-running series at Vaillant started as \"Nanar, Jujube et Piette\", which was renamed \"Nanar et Jujube\" then \"Gai-Luron\" for the supporting character who had by then taken centre stage. Gai-Luron is a dog heavily influenced by Tex Avery's Droopy, who almost never laughs or displays any emotions and is incorrigibly somnolent.\n\nIn 1965 Gotlib submitted strips to \"Pilote\" magazine and was greeted with open arms by its influential co-founder and editor, René Goscinny of \"Astérix\" fame. Together they created \"Les Dingodossiers\", a series of mock lectures on random subjects which Goscinny wrote and Gotlib drew. In 1967, Goscinny, who worked on many strips simultaneously while editing the magazine, asked Gotlib to continue the series alone. Gotlib instead launched a new one, \"Rubrique-à-Brac\", which was similar to the Dingodossiers in format but progressively acquired a more adult and less formal tone. Leftover pages from both series were later published in album form as \"Trucs-en-vrac\".\n\n\"Rubrique-à-Brac\" was a hit with \"Pilote\"'s readers and made Gotlib famous. It introduced several signature Gotlib gimmicks, such as the extensive use of random running gags (Isaac Newton getting hit on the head by random objects being the omnipresent one) and the presence of a miniature character, a ladybug mimicking the action, to make up for the absence of settings, which Gotlib disliked drawing.\n\nIn 1971, Gotlib gave up the \"Gai-Luron\" series to his collaborator Henri Dufranne. He participated in a radio program with Goscinny, Fred and Gébé, and collaborated with film director Patrice Leconte, who made a documentary about him in 1974. Gotlib created another character, \"Hamster Jovial\", for music monthly \"Rock & Folk\". \"Hamster Jovial\" (\"Genial Hamster\") is an incurably naff boy-scout troop leader desperate to catch up with pop culture and impress his charges, two cubs and a girl guide. \n\nIn 1972, Gotlib launched the comics magazine \"l'Echo des savanes\" with Claire Bretecher and Nikita Mandryka. The original aim was to get stories unsuitable for \"Pilote\" magazine—which was aimed at school-age readers—out of their system, but \"l'Echo des savanes\" was a huge commercial success.\n\nHowever, the trio's complete lack of business training meant the magazine went deep in the red and they were forced to sell it to a publishing concern. Gotlib's contributions to the magazine were published in album form as \"Rhââ Lovely\" (named after a rapist's line in Alfred Hitchcock's \"Frenzy\") and \"Rha-Gnagna\". Those stories are mostly concerned with smashing taboos and feature much sexuality and other bodily functions, as well as cod-psychoanalysis and pot shots at authority figures of all kinds including divinities. Gotlib, Mandryka and Brétécher stopped working for \"l'Echo des Savanes\" after selling it.\n\nGotlib saw there was a strong market for adult comics and decided to start a new publication and have it run more professionally. To do this, he enrolled childhood friend, Jacques Diament, as administrator and another \"Pilote\" veteran, Alexis to help with the creative direction, and founded \"Fluide Glacial\" and parent publishing company 'Audie', a comically misspelled acronym of \"Amusement, Umour, Derision, Ilarité Et toutes ces sortes de choses\". \"Fluide Glacial\" launched the career of a number of unknown or little-known cartoonists, most of whom were influenced by Gotlib in the first place: Édika, Goossens and Dupuy & Berberian. Belgian veteran André Franquin contributed his \"Idées Noires\" strip. Alexis died of aneurysm rupture in 1977, leaving Gotlib and Diament in charge, though he is credited to this day as \"Director of conscience\" of \"Fluide Glacial\".\n\nGotlib created two characters in \"Fluide Glacial\": Superdupont with Jacques Lob and Pervers Pépère. Superdupont is a French, highly patriotic answer to US super-heroes who wears a vest and beret and fights a secret organisation called Anti-France. Gotlib mostly wrote or co-wrote Superdupont stories, though he drew a handful of them. The strip was successful enough to be made into a stage show by Jérôme Savary. Pervers Pépère is a stereotypical mac-sporting dirty old man who appeared in one-page stories. In the 1980s, he increasingly focused on running \"Fluide Glacial\" — in which he also wrote a column — and gradually withdrew from cartooning. However, he resuscitated \"Gai-Luron\" in 1986 when the back-catalogue was re-published by Audie and needed promoting; he drew enough new stories for a final album, \"La Bataille Navale\".\n\nIn 1991, Gotlib received the Angoulême Festival Grand Prix and, as per tradition, chaired the jury of the next year's festival. In 1993, he wrote an autobiography, \"J'existe, je me suis rencontré\", focusing on his youth, and in 2006 a more thorough one with journalist Gilles Verlant: \"Ma Vie-en-Vrac\".\n\nIn 1995, having taken a back seat for a couple of years, Diament and Gotlib sold \"Fluide Glacial\" and \"Audie\" to publisher Flammarion and relinquished responsibilities, though Gotlib continued his column for some time. \"Fluide Glacial\" remains profitable and has outlived all its competitors such as \"Vaillant/Pif\", \"Pilote\" and the \"Hara-Kiri\" stable.\n\nGotlib's first series were made in a very humoristic tone. Each story consisted of two to four strips drawn in white and black. \"Rubrique-à-Brac\" and \"Les Dingodossiers\" consisted of didactic dossiers of short unrelated strips, drawn in black and white. They revisited an extremely wide range of subjects and dealt with stereotypes and clichés in a caricatural way. Gotlib used caricature and parodies to depict the everyday life, and greets it with extreme derision. In \"Cinemastok\" and \"Gai-Luron\", the same technique was used, although these series were presented in a different manner.\n\nLater, from his departure from \"Pilote\" in 1972, Gotlib style changed a lot, the scenario as well as the illustrations. The last tome of Rubrique-à-Brac is already marked by this evolution, but it became more obvious with the series published in \"L'Echo des Savannes\" and \"Fluide Glacial\". These two comics magazine were created by Gotlib for an adult audience exclusively, and made it possible for Gotlib to express himself entirely freely, while censorship was present in Pilote, magazine made for a young public. \"Rhââ Lovely \", \"Rhâ-Gnagna \" and \"Pervers Pépère \" are series exclusively dedicated to sex satire, but sexual matters are also present in \"Hamster Jovial\". Most of Gotlib's strips are background-free, with a large portion of the panels being occupied by elaborate dialogues. Also, the large majority of his series were black-and-white in their original publication.\n\nIn 1973 he designed the album cover for French guitarist Marcel Dadi's record 'La Guitare à Dadi' (1974).\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1960 it became the independent Togolese Republic, and the present day nation of Togo.\n\nFrench troops landed at Little Popo on August 6, 1914, meeting little resistance. The French proceeded inland, taking the town of Togo on August 8. On August 26, 1914, the German protectorate of Togoland was invaded by French and British forces and fell after five days of brief resistance. The colony surrendered \"without conditions\" with British and French troops landing in Kamina on August 27, 1914. The Germans had offered to surrender to the British on terms, to which the British responded a surrender must be unconditional, promising to respect private property, with little interference in trade or private interests and firms. Period news reports suggest the Germans had used expanding bullets during the campaign and had armed native people not under their control, both violations of the Hague Conventions. Togoland was divided into French and British administrative zones in 1916, and following the war, Togoland formally became a League of Nations mandate divided for administrative purposes between France and the United Kingdom.\n\nGerman nationalists in the Weimar Republic were reported to have objected to the seizure of the colony by the French via an interpellation in 1920, expressing their view that it violated Article 22 of the Treaty of Versailles. They also exclaimed via a news release that \"the German Government naturally leaves nothing undone to prevent an interpretation of the treaty which would justify France's alleged intention.\" The value of the colony to France was found in the existing railways, permitting a new link to the railway in Dahomey at Atakpamé and the ports of Lome, Segura and Little Popo.\n\nAfter World War II, the mandate became a UN trust territory, still administered by French commissioners.\n\nBy statute in 1955, French Togoland became an autonomous republic within the French union, although it retained its UN trusteeship status. A legislative assembly elected by universal adult suffrage had considerable power over internal affairs, with an elected executive body headed by a prime minister responsible to the legislature. These changes were embodied in a constitution approved in a 1956 referendum. On September 10, 1956, Nicolas Grunitzky became prime minister of the Autonomous Republic of Togo. However, due to irregularities in the plebiscite, an unsupervised general election was held in 1958 and won by Sylvanus Olympio. On April 27, 1960, in a smooth transition, Togo severed its constitutional ties with France, shed its UN trusteeship status, and became fully independent under a provisional constitution with Olympio as president.\n\n"}

Alongside chowder, bisque is one of the most popular seafood soups.\n\nIt is thought the name is derived from \"Biscay\", as in Bay of Biscay, but the crustaceans are certainly \"bis cuites\" \"twice cooked\" (by analogy to a biscuit) for they are first sautéed lightly in their shells, then simmered in wine and aromatic ingredients, before being strained, followed by the addition of cream.\n\nBisque is a method of extracting flavor from imperfect crustaceans not good enough to send to market. In an authentic bisque, the shells are ground to a fine paste and added to thicken the soup. Julia Child even remarked, \"Do not wash anything off until the soup is done because you will be using the same utensils repeatedly and you don't want any marvelous tidbits of flavor losing themselves down the drain.\" Bisques are thickened with rice, which can either be strained out, leaving behind the starch, or pureed during the final stages.\n\nSeafood bisque is traditionally served in a low two-handled cup on a saucer or in a mug.\n\nBisque is also commonly used to refer to cream-based soups that do not contain seafood, in which the sometimes pre-cooked ingredients are pureed or processed in a food processor or a food mill.

{"id": "2212334", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2212334", "title": "Biscuit porcelain", "text": "Biscuit porcelain\n\nBiscuit porcelain, bisque porcelain or bisque is unglazed, white porcelain treated as a final product, with a matte appearance and texture to the touch. It has been widely used in European pottery, mainly for sculptural and decorative objects that are not tableware and so do not need a glaze for protection. \n\nThe term \"biscuit\" refers to any type of fired but unglazed pottery in the course of manufacture, but only in porcelain is it a term for a final product. Unglazed earthenware as a final product is often called terracotta, and in stoneware equivalent unglazed wares (such as jasperware) are often called \"dry-bodied\". Many types of pottery, including most porcelain wares, have a glaze applied, either before a single firing, or at the biscuit stage, with a further firing. \n\nSmall figurines and other decorative pieces have often been made in biscuit, as well as larger portrait busts and other sculptures; the appearance of biscuit is very similar to that of carved and smoothed marble, the traditional prestige material for sculpture in the West. It is hardly used in Chinese porcelain or that of other East Asian countries, but in Europe became very popular for figures in the second half of the 18th century, as Neoclassicism dominated contemporary styles. It was first used at Vincennes porcelain in 1751 by Jean-Jacques Bachelier.\n\nBiscuit figures have to be free from the common small imperfections that a glaze and painted decoration could cover up, and were therefore usually more expensive than glazed ones. They are also more difficult to keep clean.\n\nA popular use for biscuit porcelain was the manufacture of bisque dolls in the 19th century, where the porcelain was typically tinted or painted in flesh tones. In the doll world, \"bisque\" is usually the term used, rather than \"biscuit\". Parian ware is a 19th-century type of biscuit.\n\nAlthough the great majority of biscuit figures (other than dolls) are entirely in white, there are a number of ways of using colour in the technique.\n\nJasperware, developed by Wedgwood in the 1770s and soon very popular all over Europe, is usually classed as stoneware rather than porcelain, but the style of using two contrasting colours of biscuit was sometimes used in porcelain. The Real Fábrica del Buen Retiro in Madrid made a porcelain room in the Casita del Principe, El Escorial decorated with 234 plaques in the style, with a \"Wedgwood blue\" ground and the design in white biscuit porcelain in low relief. These were applied as sprigs, meaning that they made separately as thin pieces, and stuck to the main blue body before firing. The plaques are framed like paintings; they were made between 1790 and 1795. The figure by the same factory illustrated here uses elements modelled in a coloured paste, and is all biscuit. \n\nBiscuit porcelain could also be painted with unfired paint rather than the enamels normal overglaze decoration uses, the lack of a shiny surface giving a strikingly different effect in the best examples. This rare technique is called \"coloured biscuit\", and is found from the 19th century onwards. As with 18th-century pieces painted over the glaze, the paint may peel if not well looked after. \n\nA piece could be made with some areas left as biscuit while others are glazed and enamelled in the usual way. A Chelsea-Derby figure of George II of the United Kingdom (1773-74) leaning on a classical plinth and standing on a high base has only the figure in biscuit. \n\nThis part-glazing also occurs in other types of pottery, and for example is very common in the earthenware Chinese Tang dynasty tomb figures. Other pieces \"reserve\" areas in biscuit, by giving them a temporary coating of wax or something similar to keep the glaze off; this is a fairly common feature of Longquan celadon (which is porcelain in Chinese terms), and also found in Ming dragons. Some Chinese pieces are described as \"porcelain with polychrome enamels on the biscuit\" - that is, using the normal \"overglaze\" technique on biscuit, but with no actual glaze, often a revivalist style evoking earlier sancai wares (which were not in porcelain). \n\nThe laborious and mostly 19th-century pâte-sur-pâte technique often uses biscuit for at least one of the colours.\n\n"}

When they finally meet and Juliette leaves her fiancé Patrick for Robert, the situation quickly escalates.\n\nParisian illustrator Robert becomes obsessed with a young woman, Juliette. Night after night, Robert sneaks around the house to catch a glimpse of Juliette, until one day he finally gathers the courage to introduce himself. Juliette realizes that she is not happy with her fiancé, Patrick, and leaves him to be with Robert. Robert in turn is not happy with Juliette's obtrusive advances.\n\nOne night, Patrick attacks Robert in a deserted area; Robert defends himself and knocks Patrick unconscious, leaving him on the shores of a nearby river. The next day, Robert is interrogated by the police. Patrick is missing, and suddenly Robert is the prime suspect. Nobody knows that Patrick has allied with Robert's bitter ex-wife, Véronique, to take revenge on Robert; he is hiding from the police in order to make them think Robert killed him.

It was not mutually intelligible with Berbice Creole Dutch, also spoken in Guyana. This language has been classified as extinct since 1998.\n\nBy the twentieth century, the existence of a Dutch creole language in the former Essequibo colony was largely forgotten about, and the language only gained the interest of linguists after the Guyanan linguist Ian E. Robertson, who had already brought Berbice Creole Dutch to the attention of the scientific community, also found people on the Essequibo River who remembered a Dutch creole language. In contrast to Berbice Creole Dutch, however, Skepi—which name derives from \"Yskepi\", the first Dutch name of the Essequibo River—was not actively spoken anymore during Robertson's fieldwork. The sample sentences and a Swadesh list compiled by Robertson were thus based on the memories of non-native speakers of the language still spoken by their parents or grandparents.\n\nAfter Robertson published his material, some older sources emerged. In the memoir of reverend Thomas Youd, who was a missionary in British Guiana, it is asserted that British missionaries learnt Skepi in the 1830s and that they used this language in their church services. According to this memoir, these missionaries also produced a dictionary of the language, which since has been lost, however. This is equally the case for a \"word list submitted by a German veterinary surgeon.\"\n\nIn 2013, a letter written by Essequibo planter Wernard van Vloten emerged which contained a small fragment in Skepi Dutch. This letter, which was dated 26 September 1780, is believed to be the oldest source of the Skepi language.\n\nSince the language was already extinct when Ian Robertson first investigated the Dutch creoles in Guyana in 1975, much of Skepi is known only through the memory the descendants of native speakers have of the language their forefathers spoke. The following three sample sentences appeared in a Zeelandic newspaper in 1997.\n\nTranslation: \"I want a slice of bread.\"\n\nTranslation: \"Where shall I put it?\"\n\nTranslation: \"\"It was not you, it was that other minister (clergyman).\"\"\n\nTranslation: \"\"[...] and try to come one beautiful day to Uncle who lives in a warm country, and when he comes back to the country of the White people, he will bring nice things for the four children.’\"\"\n\n"}

Inside the organisation is the British Aviation Group and the UK Space Agency.\n\nOn 29 March 1915 a number of British aircraft manufacturers and industrialists met to arrange a standards body and production pooling system known as the Society of British Aircraft Constructors. Notable among the aircraft participants were Herbert Austin, Frederick Handley Page, H.V. Roe of Avro, and E.B. Parker of Short Brothers. The group agreed to share their designs among a variety of 3rd party factories in order to be able to quickly produce new designs on demand.

They were also instrumental in approaching Lloyd's of London to start the inspection and insurance of aircraft, which led to increased commercial aviation.\n\nIn 1932 the group hosted a one-day air show and trade fair at the Hendon airfield in London on 19 June, the day after the annual RAF Hendon display. Similar one-day events were held for the next three years, but 1935 was the last Hendon RAF display.

Immediately after the War it was held at Radlett, the home of Handley Page on 12–13 September, and early September became the regular date. In 1947 the show was again at Radlett with three flying days. In 1948 the meeting was moved to the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough and was six days long with three flying days, setting the pattern for the future.\n\nThe Farnborough shows were held annually as trade fairs for British manufacturers and with two public days, the Saturday and Sunday, throughout the 1950s. Crowds were large: on the last day, the Sunday of the 1954 show some 160,000 people attended. In 1962 the British-only rule was slightly relaxed by allowing the participation of foreign aircraft with British engines. 1962 was also the last of the annual shows, the next being held in 1964 and thenceforth biennially; in 1968 European manufacturers were invited. In 1974 the show accepted international participation and from 1978 it became known as the \"Farnborough International\". Since 1964 the Farnborough has alternated with the Paris Air Show.\n\nThe name changed from \"Society of British Aircraft Constructors\" to \"Society of British Aerospace Companies\" in 1964.\n\nSBAC Scotland was formed in 2005.\n\nAfter WWII the SBAC introduced a designation system for British aircraft consisting of a two letter manufacturer code followed by a sequence number, with designations allocated as follows:-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2212371", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2212371", "title": "Simon effect", "text": "Simon effect\n\nIn psychology, the Simon effect is the finding that the difference in accuracy or reaction time \nbetween trials in which stimulus and response are on the same side and trials in which they are on opposite sides, with responses being generally slower and less accurate when the stimulus and response are on opposite sides. It is named for J. R. Simon who first published the effect in the late 1960s. Simon's original explanation for the effect was that there is \"an innate tendency to respond toward the source of stimulation\".\n\nAccording to the simple models of information processing that existed at the time, there are three stages of processing: stimulus identification, response selection, and response execution or the motor stage. The Simon Effect is generally thought to involve interference which occurs in the response-selection stage. This is similar to, yet distinct from, the interference that produces the better-known Stroop effect.\n\nIn Simon's original study, two lights (the stimulus) were placed on a rotating circular panel. This device would be rotated at varying degrees (away from the horizontal plane). Simon wished to see if an alteration of the spatial relationship, relative to the response keys, affected performance. Age was also a probable factor in reaction time. As predicted the reaction time of the groups increased based on the relative position of the light stimulus (age was not a factor). The reaction time increased by as much as 30%. (Simon & Wolf, 1963).\n\nHowever, what is usually seen as the first genuine demonstration of the effect that became known as the Simon effect is by Simon & Rudell (1967). Here, they had participants respond to the words \"left\" and \"right\" that were randomly presented to the left or right ear. Although the auditory location was completely irrelevant to the task, participants showed marked increases in reaction latency if the location of the stimulus was not the same as the required response (if, for example, they were to react left to a word that was presented in the right ear).\n\nA typical demonstration of the Simon effect involves placing a participant in front of a computer monitor and a panel with two buttons on it, which he or she may press. The participant is told that they should press the button on the right when they see something red appear on the screen, and the button on the left when they see something green. Participants are usually told to ignore the location of the stimulus and base their response on the task-relevant color.\n\nParticipants typically react faster to red lights that appear on the right hand side of the screen by pressing the button on the right of their panel (congruent trials). Reaction times are typically slower when the red stimulus appears on the left hand side of the screen and the participant must push the button on the right of their panel (incongruent trials). The same, but vice versa, is true for the green stimuli.\n\nThis happens despite the fact that the position of the stimulus on the screen relative to the physical position of the buttons on the panel is irrelevant to the task and not correlated with which response is correct. The task, after all, requires the subject to note only the colour of the object (i.e., red or green) by pushing the corresponding button, and not its position on the screen.\n\nAccording to Simon himself (1969), the location of the stimulus, although irrelevant to the task, directly influences response-selection due to an automatic tendency to 'react towards the source of the stimulation'. Although other accounts have been suggested (cf. Hommel, 1993), explanations for the Simon effect generally refer back to the interference that occurs in the response-selection stage of decision making. Neurologically there could be involvement of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, as well as the Anterior cingulate cortex, which is thought to be responsible for conflict monitoring. The Simon Effect shows that location information cannot be ignored and will affect decision making, even if the participant knows that the information is irrelevant.\n\nLogical argument for response selection:\n\nThe challenge in the Simon effect is said to occur during the response selection stage of judgment. This is due to two factors which eliminate the stimulus identification stage and the execution state. In the stimulus identification stage the participant only needs to be cognitively aware that a stimulus is present. An error would not occur at this stage unless he or she were visually impaired or had some sort of stimulus deficit. As well, an error or delay cannot occur during the execution state because an action has already been decided upon in the previous stage (the response selection stage) and no further decision making takes place (i.e. you cannot make a change to your response without going back to the second stage).\n\nA knowledge of the Simon effect is useful in the design of human-machine interfaces. Aircraft cockpits, for example, require a person to react quickly to a situation. If a pilot is flying a plane and there is a problem with the left engine, an aircraft with a good human-machine interface design (which most have) would position the indicator light for the left engine to the left of the indicator light for the right engine. This interface would display information in a way that matches the types of responses that people should make. If it were the other way around, the pilot might be more likely to respond incorrectly and adjust the wrong engine.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2212403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2212403", "title": "Riviera: The Promised Land", "text": "Riviera: The Promised Land\n\nThe player takes the role of Ein, a Grim Angel, who must battle against demons as well as antagonistic Grim Angels to seal away the four fountainheads of evil known as the Accursed. He is accompanied by four heroines—Fia, Lina, Serene and Cierra—as well as his cat-like familiar Rose. \"Riviera\" also contains dating sim elements, as the hero can achieve multiple endings with the supporting characters through decisions made throughout the game.\n\n\"Riviera: The Promised Land\" is a turn-based role-playing video game, with some elements from strategy and dating sim games. The last aspect manifests itself in the conversation in the game. Ein will often have to favor either Fia, Lina, Serene or Cierra over the others in scenes in which the characters interact with each other. This affects their trust for Ein, their mood, and eventually, the game's outcome.\nFor each of the seven main chapters of the game, the player starts in Elendia, and is given a mission. The player then moves on to wherever that mission takes place, proceeding through nine stages, to the eighth stage which will contain the chapter boss. The ninth stage is secret, and often has a particular method of infiltration. Within each stage are multiple screens, all with events and battles of their own. When a chapter is completed, all trigger points currently accumulated are erased. The player is taken to a results screen showing how they performed in the chapter, and gains trigger points based on that performance that can be used in the next chapter.\n\nUnlike most RPGs, when not in battle, the player does not have full control over Ein's movement. Instead of being able to freely move with directional buttons, the player controls Ein through triggers, in two modes. Each stage is made up of several screens, each screen having triggers to explore and potentially battles to engage in.\nIn Look Mode, the player may press directional buttons corresponding to triggers shown on the screen. Some triggers will not appear until certain events have taken place, and some triggers will change based on repeated investigation. However, many triggers require TP, Trigger Points, earned in battle. These triggers can cue many things, from battles, to event scenes and free items.\nIn Move Mode, the player may advance or backtrack (limited) to previous screens. In a similar fashion to Look Mode, triggers will appear on the screen and a corresponding directional button must be pressed to move to them, adding a turn to the count. Unlike Look Mode, however, triggers in Move Mode do not require Trigger Points, so one may move as much as one likes, assuming there is no turn limit. Once the player has exited the final screen of a stage, the player will be prompted to save and then move on to the next stage.\n\nBefore a battle begins, the player usually has the choice to retreat, giving them time to prepare. For every battle, the player may choose only three combatants out of a possible five, and a positioning scheme for them. The player can either choose the Attack or Magic formation. The Attack formation allows Attack based moves a shorter recharge time, and there will be two characters in the front row, and a single character in the back row. In Magic formation, Magic users have a shorter recharge time and positioning is reversed. Following that decision the player must choose the items to bring. Only sixteen items can be held at any time, and there are no methods of storage. The player may only bring four of those sixteen items into battle for all three characters to use. However, for every item, each character has a different attack; where, with a staff, Cierra might do great damage with a magical attack, Fia would heal an ally.\n\nOnce all the preparations are made, battle begins. Turn order is decided by a countdown based on agility, last move used and formation. A player character may select from as many as eight different skills: one normal skill for each item, and, if they are well trained with that item and the OverDrive Gauge is sufficiently filled, a secondary, more interesting OverSkill. Using a skill, however, reduces how many more times that item can be used, as \"Riviera\" employs a \"Fire Emblem\"-styled system of item endurance allowing the item to be used only a certain number of times before it breaks entirely. The OverDrive Gauge fills throughout battle, as characters receive and deal damage, and with certain skills. At various levels, characters can use different skills, because certain skills require more of the gauge be filled. There are five levels of skills for player characters: Level 0 skills that may be used whenever and without training; Levels 1 through 3 skills, which require training and deplete that amount of the OverDrive Gauge; and Execution Level skills that may be used at any level of OverDrive Gauge fullness, but will shatter the gauge for the battle, and are only obtained through the story. Enemies have a similar gauge with three levels: Normal, Rage and Max. At Normal they may only use normal attacks. At Rage they may use Rage and Normal attacks, but the latter depletes the gauge. At Max, they may use all three, but only Max skills will deplete the gauge, and will deplete it fully. Enemies also have Etc. attacks, ranging from healing to transformation, that may be used at any time.\n\nOnce all allies have had their HP depleted to zero, the battle will end triggering a Game Over, which will give the player the option to retry the battle with the enemies' stats lowered and the OverDrive Gauge filled. If all enemies have had their HP deplete to zero, instead, the player will achieve victory and receive a rank based on their performance in battle. The rank is based both on time spent in battle and the finisher, but the rank will also be lowered if the player retried. Trigger Points and items are distributed based on the rank the player obtained in the battle. Also, if a character used an item enough times, that character will be rewarded with a stat up and the unlocking of an OverSkill that can be used in later battles.\n\n\"Riviera: The Promised Land\" draws from diverse mythologies, most prominently Norse, incorporating concepts such as Ragnarok and Yggdrasil into its story. The game takes place mostly on the continent of Riviera, with the characters visiting various locales such as a sinking city, a forest, and an abandoned cemetery.\n\n\"Riviera\" offers a cast of six playable characters.\n\nThe above characters are the only playable characters in the game. \"Riviera\" has several dozen supporting characters, notably Rose (Ein's familiar); Hector (the game's main villain, voiced by Keith Silverstein in English); Malice (grim angel and Hector's henchwoman); Ursula, guardian spirit of Riviera; and the Four Accursed, who act as Stage bosses. There are also numerous Elendian citizens, fairies and undines who help Ein along the way.\n\nA thousand years before the game takes place, a war known as Ragnarok took place. The gods of Asgard were attacked and overrun by demons from Utgard. In desperation, the gods broke an ancient covenant; they sacrificed their lives to create black-winged reapers that came to be known as Grim Angels. Each was armed with a \"Diviner\", a sacred weapon with which they easily vanquished the demons. After the war ended, Utgard was renamed Riviera and turned into a beautiful paradise. The gods left their knowledge and authority in the stewardship of seven Magi and their power in the care of the Sprites, the inhabitants of a peaceful Riviera.\nAfter a thousand years of peace, rumors of the demons’ return surfaced. Hector, one of the Seven Magi, sends the Grim Angels Ein and Ledah to Riviera, accompanied by Ein's familiar, Rose. They are ordered to activate the \"Retribution\", a hidden power of the gods which would eliminate the demons but destroy Riviera in the process. At the end of Heaven's Gate, they meet Ursula, the guardian of Riviera. Ein falls in battle and is taken to Yggdrasil, the heart of Riviera, by Ursula. Discovering that he has a good heart, she entrusts him with the protection of Riviera.\n\nEin wakes up suffering from amnesia and able to recall neither his purpose nor his origin. He is nursed by Fia and Lina, residents of Elendia, which is a village near Yggdrasil. News about the rebirth of the \"Accursed\" – the \"progenitors of evil\" – reaches them and they set out to investigate. Eventually, they defeat all four and meet Serene, Cierra and even Rose along the way. Meanwhile, Ledah searches for Yggdrasil, so that he may activate the \"Retribution\".\n\nEin now expects to live peacefully in Elendia with his new-found friends, but Ursula informs them that Ledah has breached Yggdrasil and intends to destroy the three \"Aquariums\", the sources of Yggdrasil's power, in an attempt to activate the Retribution. The six companions (Ein, Lina, Fia, Serene, Cierra and Rose) head out to Yggdrasil. Although they manage to subdue Ledah in battle, it is the Grim Angel Malice, Hector's pawn, who deals the fatal blow. A dying Ledah warns them that Hector has tricked them all this time: he does not fulfill the will of the gods, but seeks ultimate power for himself.\n\nThey pursue Malice, but are unable to prevent her from destroying the last Aquarium. They battle her, and eventually Ledah appears to intercept one of Malice's attacks. Ledah dies soon after, telling Ein to stop Hector. The companions then race to the \"Maze of Shadows\" where Seth, the Sealed One, is imprisoned. There, Hector takes the life of Malice and the girl that Ein has become closest to; the last two souls required to unleash Seth. Hector intends to become the one True God, and to this end he fuses his body with that of Seth to become Seth-Rah. However, Ein and his companions are able to defeat Seth-Rah, and afterwards they are teleported back to Yggdrasil by Ursula just before the entire Maze collapses.\n\nUpon their return, Ursula reveals that, with the death of her counterpart Seth, she too will cease to exist. Before disappearing, she resurrects the girl that Hector killed, and also charges Ein, Fia, Lina, Serene, Cierra and Rose with the continued protection of Riviera.\n\nSince \"Riviera\" is a renai, the player can achieve multiple endings depending on his responses to his companions. Depending upon them, an ending may be achieved with Ein and the girl of choice having a special scene together. The ending with Rose is a hidden ending, as it was not in the original WSC game, and Rose doesn't have a trust stat in the game. The last frame also tells (no matter what the ending) that Rose becomes a historian in later life and records their adventures.\n\n\"Riviera: The Promised Land\" was originally developed for the WonderSwan Color. Development started in November 2000, with a Japan-only release in 2002. In 2004, Riviera was remade for the Game Boy Advance, featuring a completely new art style owed to Sunaho Tobe's involvement in the project, and also had several new CGs, events and limited voice acting. This version saw an eventual translation and North American release courtesy of Atlus USA, in 2005. In 2006, Sting announced and released a PSP remake of the game, with more CGs, events, and complete voice acting, but the sprites were merely upscaled versions of those used in the WSC and GBA versions. After several retailers leaked the news, Atlus USA officially announced they would be releasing it in North America, along with an extra chapter not appearing in the Japanese version. In October 2007, a Special Edition was released by Sting in Japan, and was essentially the US PSP version with Japanese text replacing English text.\n\nAnother Dept. Heaven title, had an effect on the following PSP remake of Riviera. Artist Sunaho Tobe is quoted as saying that in the CG image for the Archangel, she drew inspiration from the designs of \"Yggdra Union\".\n\nThe Game Boy Advance release of Riviera featured a large amount of voice work for a Game Boy Advance title boasting nearly two-hundred voice clips, far more than majority of games for the system.\n\nThe PSP release is fully voiced. The Japanese voice actors for the Japanese PSP version are largely the same as the GBA version. Atlus USA chose to keep the Japanese voices in its localization of the game, and also added English voice work. The English voice actors for the game are also largely the same as the GBA version's English voice actors.\n\nThe soundtrack for Riviera was composed mostly by Minako Adachi, with a few tracks by Shigeki Hayashi, and spanned less than forty tracks. This music has been rearranged and rerecorded for each release of the game, but has for the most part remained static.\n\nThe soundtrack has been released twice, with the first following the GBA version's release, the \"Riviera Full Arrange Soundtrack\", which featured arranged versions of all the songs, but not the original GBA or WSC versions. Soon after came the \"Riviera Intro Disc\" which featured the WSC music, as well as a drama track introducing all the characters. In February 2007, following the release of the PSP version of the game, Sting released the \"Riviera Perfect Audio Collection Plus\", a three disc collection containing the original music from all three versions of the game.\n\nSting has also released several drama tracks for Riviera, the first appearing on the \"Riviera Intro Disc\", followed by four on the \"Riviera Epilogue Disc\", and then a full drama CD following weekly airings on used to promote the PSP version. This drama CD was called \"The Precious Chapter\" and contained seven drama tracks spanning two discs.\n\nThe Game Boy Advance version of \"Riviera: The Promised Land\" received \"generally favorable reviews\", while the PSP version received \"average\" reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave the WonderSwan Color version a score of 31 out of 40; in 2004 the same magazine gave the GBA version a score of one nine, one eight, one seven, and one eight for a total of 32 out of 40; and in 2006 it gave the PSP version a score of two eights and two sevens for a total of 30 out of 40.\n\nOfficial websites:\n"}

{"id": "2212416", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2212416", "title": "Nürburg", "text": "Nürburg\n\nNürburg () is a town in the German district of Ahrweiler, in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. It is also the name of the local castle, Nürburg Castle, which was built in the High Middle Ages. The name is derived from Latin \"niger\", meaning \"black\", and High German \"burg\", meaning \"castle\". The castle is made of basalt which usually has black color. The well-known racing track Nürburgring is nearby.\n\nThe Nürburg rises above the village of the same name on the second-highest hill in the Eifel (). The castle and hill are regarded as a characteristic feature of the Eifel. Even though it is one of the most significant castles in the Eifel, it nevertheless still needs to be researched in full. There are almost no written sources relating to the history of the castle's construction in the Middle Ages. The hill is referred to in documentary evidence in AD 954 by the name \"mone nore\", which means black hill. In descriptions of boundaries which served to clarify which property belonged to whom, it was used as a significant reference marker. The name Nürburg is thought to derive from \"mons nore\", as the color of the volcanic basalt used to build the castle exhibits an unusually dark color.\n\nThe Nürburg is considered to be the \"highest castle in Rhineland-Pfalz\", and on a clear day, the spires of the Cologne Cathedral may be seen.\n\nThe history of when the Nürburg was established has not been definitively clarified. There is no evidence to suggest that it was built instead of a Roman fort, the commonly held view in the local area. Discoveries of Roman coins do not constitute sufficient evidence. Owing to a similarity between names, one legend even traces the Nürburg back to a fort established by Emperor Nero. Among other things, archaeological barrows attest to the fact that the area surrounding the castle was populated in early historical times. However, there are no indications that the castle hill was once home to a refuge or prehistoric walled fortification, as is occasionally thought.\n\nWhile local historians held the view that the castle had been erected by Theoderich I, Count of Are, (who died in 1132) as a refuge for the ruling court of Adenau, nowadays his son Ulrich von Are, the self-proclaimed Count of Nürburg, is considered to be the person responsible for commissioning the building of the castle, even though there is no source material to back this theory. Castle Are is situated above Altenahr, and was built by a group of counts, probably the Ahrgau counts. The group was associated with the Carolingian nobility and named itself after it.\n\nThe Nürburg is situated south of Castle Are, where the Counts of Are belonged to a family circle whose members can be traced back to the 9th century. In the 10th century, they are alleged to have held rights in what would subsequently become the village of Nürburg. The counts were able to build up an independent power base within the High Eifel and at the upper Ahr and this power base was centered between Adenau, Nürburg, and Altenahr. The counts were divided up between several ancestral lines: the Are-Hochstaden line held the property in the village of Nürburg.\n\nAround 1220/30, a different ancestral line built Neuenahr Castle. With the death of Count Lothar in around 1246, the Counts of Are-Hochstaden died out. Their estate was inherited by the Archbishop of Cologne (Konrad von Are-Hochstaden).\n\nCount Ulrich von Nürburg first appears in documents linking him to the Nürburg in 1169. He is considered to be the person responsible for commissioning the building of the castle. There is a document originating from 1166 in which Are and Nürburg Castles are mentioned within the context of rights which the Archbishop of Cologne granted to Count Ulrich and his family. At that time, the castle was an open house of the Archbishop of Cologne: the opening right affording him access to the castle and the option to use it if he needed to. In those days, the counts of Are-Nürburg were supporters of the Staufian imperial family.\n\nHistorians suspected that the officials who were pledged the use of the castle from the 14–16th century were more concerned with exploiting the castle than with preserving it. This was reflected in the large amount of damage that Augustin von Braunsberg noted when he financed its repair in 1534. According to his report, Augustin had the gate to the valley re-erected and had a stable built in the courtyard. A storm had also torn off the roof of the main tower and damaged the vaults within. In order to prevent its total collapse, the tower was reconstructed in 1535. Augustin also financed the construction of a brewery, cowshed, meat house, and bakery within the walls.\n\nIn 1587, the castle was plundered by Dutch soldiers. There are also reports from the early 17th century outlining the damage to, and decline of the castle. An occupation in 1605 by southern European soldiers caused significant damage. The soldiers removed the lead bracing in the main tower leaving it in a perilous state of near collapse. In 1607, funds were raised by the local archiepiscopal commission, and restoration work carried out in 1612, where 77 windows were installed to make the castle more livable. However, that same year, a severe storm tore the chimneys and roofs off some of the buildings leaving the castle in a nearly ruined state. In 1633, during Thirty Years' War, the castle was occupied by Swedish troops as a defensible position, and by 1656, the castle fell into a state of near uninhabitability. Despite the crumbling walls, the castle was still seen an important military site due to its high position and relative ease of defense.\n\nIn 1752, the main tower of Castle Nürburg was used as a prison until the dungeons fell into a state of total ruin. From this point, the castle was abandoned and left to decay, as farmers in the area continued to remove stones from the site for use as local building material. The Burgstube hotel at the base of the castle evidences some of this pirating of the stone in its foundation that dates to the 17th century. The Franciscan friars from Adenau issued a decree from Adenau to take as much stone as they needed in order to repair their convent.\n\nDrawings from the late 18th century show the castle as a complete ruin. In 1792, the French occupied the left side of the Rhine, and in 1801, the French army destroyed the remaining portions of the outer wall, leaving only the inner wall, and the main tower standing to attest to what was the Nürburg.\n\nRestoration work started in 1846–78 where the main tower was renewed. A stone staircase was built into the tower, with the uppermost vault being reconstructed in order to provide views over the entire High Eifel. In 1871, the inner wall and main gate were completely reconstructed into the form seen today, complete with non-original fairytale style conical tops on the wall towers.\n\nIn 1953–71, the castle was transferred to the administration of the Rhineland-Palatinate. As money poured into Nürburg for repair and expansion projects to the Nürburgring, extensive work was again carried out on the castle. The walls of the wards were rebuilt, and the shoring up of the towers completed in order to make the castle safe for tourists.\n\nNürburg has a semi-continental climate with both oceanic and continental tendencies. It does however land in the former category (Köppen \"Cfb\"). With regards to the racetrack, due to the Nordschleife's varied terrain and elevation, weather may be completely different on either end of the track. The elevation shift also makes thermal differences a strong possibility. The modern Grand Prix circuit also has sizeable elevation changes between the start-finish straight and the lowest point on the opposite end of the track, but the geographical distance and actual elevation gain between the two are lower. Annual sunshine is in the 1500s, which is low by European standards, but sunnier than the nearest large city of Cologne. Contrasting that, Nürburg has cooler weather year-round due to the higher elevation of the Eifel Mountains than the Rhine Valley.\n\n"}

He was known by his nickname \"il caccola\" as he was five feet tall - although he stated that originally, the nickname came from his very young involvement, at age 14, in the Italian Social Movement (MSI), a neo-fascist political party established after the war; the name is Roman slang for \"shorty\".\n\nDelle Chiaie began as member of the Italian Social Movement (MSI), a neo-fascist party. However he rejected the participation of the MSI in elections, preferring to take the battle to the streets. He left the MSI in 1958. After participating to the foundation of the \"Centri Studi Ordine Nuovo\" with members of the MSI, he created the small \"Gruppi di Azione Rivoluzionari\" (GAR) at the end of the 1950s. Involved in various political actions, such as protesting against Eisenhower's visit to Italy or fighting against Italian Communist Party members, he already maintained close international links, notably with the Austrian Konrad Windisch, leader of the neo-Nazi \"Kameradschaftsring Nationaler Jugendverbände\" (KNJ). He then formed, in 1960, the National Vanguard (\"\"Avanguardia Nazionale\"\") as a street-fighting group. Around this time, he also became a member of the secret P2 Masonic Lodge.\n\nFrom 1962 to 1964 he was employed by the tasked with infiltrating in and breaking up left-wing demonstrations.\n\nIn May 1974, Delle Chiaie’s last known forwarding address was discovered by investigators from the Portuguese Armed Forces Movement when they raided the Lisbon HQ of Aginter Press and its political wing, \"Order and Tradition.\" The address was: Apartado 1682, El Salvador.\n\nDelle Chiaie soon became a close ally of Junio Valerio Borghese and was suspected with him in the \"Golpe Borghese\", but was acquitted because at the time he was in Barcelona.\n\nDelle Chiaie was arrested in Caracas, Venezuela on 27 March 1987 and extradited to Italy to stand trial for his role in the \"Strage di Piazza Fontana\" bombing of Milan on 12 December 1969, when 17 people were killed and 88 wounded. Delle Chiaie was acquitted by the Assize Court in Catanzaro in 1989, along with fellow accused Massimiliano Fachini. On 20 February 1989 he was declared not guilty. On 5 July 1991 on appeal was acquitted for the case and for participation to subversive association.\n\nHe was also charged with subversive association in relationship to the 1980 Bologna railway station bombing, but was acquitted on appeals.\n\nIn October 1991 he founded \"Lega Nazionalpopolare\". The movement had limited success at the national parliamentary election 1992 in Italy.\n\nStefano Delle Chiaie was described by the CIA as being the most wanted rightist terrorist in 1983, was suspected of a lot of irregular activity, but was always acquitted on appeal.\n\nIn the course of his activities Delle Chiaie was also known by a number of aliases, including \"Er Caccola\", \"Alfa\", \"Topigigio\" and \"Alfredo Di Stéfano\", after the celebrated footballer of the same name.\nDelle Chiaie has since spent most of his time working in Latin America.\nStefano Delle Chiaie took part in Yves Guérin-Sérac's \"Aginter Press\" founded in António de Oliveira Salazar's Portugal in 1965.\n\nAs cited in \"The Fourth Reich: Klaus Barbie and the Neo-Fascist Connection\", by Magnus Linklater, Isabel Hilton, and Neal Ascherson, Delle Chiaie was one of the orchestrators of the \"Cocaine Coup\" in Bolivia, along with the German war criminal Klaus Barbie, that brought General Luis García Meza to power in the early 1980s.\n\nHis international activities started early. He first took part in Yves Guérin-Sérac's \"Aginter Press\", founded in Salazar's Portugal in 1965. After assisting Borghese during his 1970 attempted coup in Italy, he escaped to Franquist Spain — as would Vincenzo Vinciguerra — and met with future members of the GAL death squad. He was then present at the June 20, 1973 Ezeiza massacre in Argentina, and then met with US-born DINA agent Michael Townley in 1975 to prepare Chilean Christian Democrat Bernardo Leighton's failed assassination. In 1976, he participated in the Montejurra Incidents against left-wing Carlists in Spain, before leaving for Latin America.\n\nIn South America, he took part in the 'Cocaine Coup' of Luis García Meza Tejada, when a notoriously corrupt military regime forced its way to power in Bolivia in 1980, with assistance from the Argentine SIDE which had been called on for 70 foreign agents. He later worked for the new government in training its soldiers. Stefano Delle Chiaie later declared in a 1983 interview to a Spanish reporter:\n\nI was decided to give my hand to the creation of an international revolutionary movement... Therefore, when the opportunity of a national revolution appeared in Bolivia, we were there to shoulder our comrades. We were neither repressors nor narco-terrorists, but political militants.\n\nJudge Baltazar Garzón's investigations demonstrated that he had worked both for Pinochet's political police, the DINA, for the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance (Triple A) and for Hugo Banzer's dictatorship in Bolivia.\n\nDelle Chiaie had met in Madrid with Pinochet during Franco's funeral in 1975, beginning his involvement with the Chilean regime and his part in Operation Condor. According to lawyer Alun Jones, representative of the Spanish justice during Spain's request to Great Britain for the extradition of Augusto Pinochet, Pinochet met with Delle Chiaie in Madrid to plan an attack against Carlos Altamirano, the leader of the Chilean Socialist Party. The plan failed, either because of Altamirano's awareness and personal caution, or because some intelligence agency — it is not known from which country — may have made him aware of the threats on his personal life.\n\nAccording to \"Le Monde diplomatique\", Delle Chiaie met with Abdullah Çatlı in Latin America and during a visit of the Turkish \"Grey Wolves\" member in Miami in September 1982. Abdullah Çatlı \"is reckoned to have been one of the main perpetrators of underground operations carried out by the Turkish branch of the Gladio organisation and had played a key role in the bloody events of the period 1976-80 which paved the way for the military coup d'état of September 1980.\n\nDuring a 1997 hearing before the Commission on terrorism headed by senator Giovanni Pellegrino, Stefano Delle Chiaie went on speaking about a \"black fascist International\" and his hopes of creating the conditions of an \"international revolution.\" He talked about the World Anticommunist League, but said that after attending a meeting in Paraguay, he left it. He claimed that the latter was a front for the CIA. He only admitted having taken part in the New European Order (NOE) organization, and denied having worked with the International Anticommunist Alliance around 1974.\n\nAccording to CIA documents, in Madrid, Stefano Delle Chiaie also met with Michael Townley, a DINA agent, and Virgilio Paz Romero, a Cuban based in Miami, with connections in Chile, to prepare, with the help of Franco's secret police, the murder of Bernardo Leighton, a Chilean Christian Democrat. On 6 October 1975 Leighton and his wife were severely injured by gunshots while in exile in Rome.\n\nDelle Chiaie, along with fellow neo-fascist Vincenzo Vinciguerra, also testified in Rome in December 1995 before judge María Servini de Cubría that Enrique Arancibia Clavel (a former Chilean secret police agent prosecuted for crimes against humanity in 2004) and Michael Townley were directly involved in this assassination.\n\nMichael Townley has claimed that DINA agent Enrique Arancibia Clavel, convicted in Argentina for the 1974 assassination of General Carlos Prats, had traveled to California in the autumn of 1977 on banking business for ALFA, alias Stefano Delle Chiaie.\n\n\nCitations\nBibliography\n\n"}
{"id": "2212431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2212431", "title": "Paramedics in Canada", "text": "Paramedics in Canada\n\nA paramedic is a healthcare professional, providing pre-hospital assessment and medical care to people with acute illnesses or injuries. In Canada, the title paramedic generally refers to those who work on land ambulances or air ambulances providing paramedic services. Paramedics are increasingly being utilized in emergency rooms by providing patient care in collaboration with physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, registered nurses, registered/licensed practical nurses and registered respiratory therapists. Increasingly in Canada, paramedics are actively pursuing self-regulation.\n\nParamedic education, or the study of paramedicine in Canada, is an intensive academic program of formal theory and clinical experience which varies from province to province. For example, the primary care paramedic program may be eight months in class with 12 days on the ambulance for precepting (British Columbia), twelve months in Manitoba or a three-year advanced diploma or four year bachelor's degree in primary care paramedicine in Ontario.\n\nTraining as an advanced care paramedic (ACP) requires that the student be first registered as a primary care paramedic. Eligibility for ACP training varies from immediate entry following PCP registration to a mandatory period of experience working as a PCP for usually one to three years. The length of time required to complete ACP training also varies between provinces, and it is generally inversely related to the length of time required to have completed the prerequisite PCP training. Shorter (around one year) programs build upon the education already learned in a two-year PCP training program, while longer (typically up to two years) college programs typically cater to PCP who graduated from shorter PCP programs.\n\nThus, while there is continual debate on the merits of longer or shorter PCP programs (often centered around teaching philosophy), in common, ACPs across Canada will generally have completed approximately three years of intensive formal education, inclusive of didactic study and clinical placements. There are two Bachelor of Health Science in paramedicine degrees currently available in Canada and are becoming the standard of paramedic education as the profession progresses at the Primary Care Paramedic entry level. This would be comparable to when nursing moved from the college based program to the collaborative or university based program in Canada. These programs are often offered through partnerships between Canadian universities and colleges, blending vocational training with higher education.\n\nThe accreditation of paramedic educational programs in Canada also varies from province to province. The Canadian Medical Association's Committee on Conjoint Accreditation offers the most comprehensive and best known system of national accreditation. \nTheir accreditation model is an independent body, and draws from The \"National Occupational Competency Profile\" as the benchmark document that details the knowledge, skills and abilities outcomes that must be possessed by practitioners of each respective level of paramedic practice.\n\nParamedicine training in the province of Quebec has been standardized and now requires all new paramedics to hold a three-year Diploma of College Studies in Emergency Prehospital Care, or \"Soins préhospitaliers d'urgence (SPU)\" in French, from a recognized CEGEP program. Upon completion of this diploma and passation of the provincial examination, one is certified at the level of primary care paramedic (PCP). Since 2015, a formal 2-year advanced care paramedic (ACP) training program was developed at Université de Montréal for experienced PCPs from Urgences-santé.\n\nIn Canada the scope of practice of paramedics is described by the National Occupational Competency Profile (NOCP) for Paramedics document developed by the Paramedic Association of Canada with financial support from the Government of Canada. The NOCP outlines four provider levels: Emergency Medical Responder (EMR), Primary Care Paramedic (PCP), Advanced Care Paramedic (ACP), and Critical Care Paramedic (CCP)\n\nOf considerable relevance to understanding the nature of Canadian paramedic practice, the reader must appreciate the considerable degree of inter-provincial variation. Although a national consensus (by way of the National Occupational Competency Profile) identifies certain knowledge, skills, and abilities as being most synonymous with a given level of paramedic practice, each province retains ultimate authority in legislating the actual administration and delivery of emergency medical services within its own borders. For this reason, any discussion of \"paramedic practice\" in Canada is necessarily broad, and general. Specific regulatory frameworks and questions related to paramedic practice can only definitively be answered by consulting relevant provincial legislation, although provincial paramedic associations may often offer a simpler overview of this topic when it is restricted to a province-by-province basis.\n\nRegulatory frameworks vary from province to province, and include direct government regulation (such as Ontario's method of credentialing its practitioners with the title of A-EMCA, or Advanced Emergency Medical Care Attendant) to professional self-regulating bodies, such as the Alberta College of Paramedics. Though the title of paramedic is a generic description of a category of practitioners, provincial variability in regulatory methods accounts for ongoing differences in actual titles that are ascribed to different levels of practitioners. For example, the province of British Columbia is the only province that uses the title \"Infant Transport Team Paramedic\", or 'ITT Paramedic' for PCPs who have received additional critical care training for paediatric, neonatal, and high risk obstetric emergencies. All provinces, however, have moved to standard titles, or have at least recognized the NOCP document as a benchmark document to permit inter-provincial labour mobility of practitioners, regardless of how titles are specifically regulated within their own provincial systems.\n\nThis is a level of practice recognized under the National Occupational Competency Profile and the Paramedic Association of Canada. As a group, EMRs staff rural ambulance stations, patient transfer services, community medical event coverage, industrial ambulances or mobile treatment centres. For many small communities, without this level of certification, the operation of a much-needed community ambulance system might not be possible. EMRs working as first responders in fire departments, police departments and institutions across Canada contribute an important role in the chain of survival. It is a level of practice focused primarily on life saving methods and is generally consistent with fewer acts beyond advanced first-aid and is the entry to practice leading to higher paramedic practice. Their scope of practices include oxygen administration, oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal airway adjuncts, the use and interpretation of a pulse oximeter, use and interpretation of a glucometer, blood pressure assessment by auscultation and palpation, chest auscultation, oropharyngeal airway suctioning, administration of the following oral, sublingual or inhaled medications: anti-anginal, anti-hypoglycemic agent, analgesia, platelet inhibitors (including nitroglycerin, glucose, nitrous oxide, acetylsalicylic acid, salbutamol, intravenous lines without medications or blood products). EMRs may administer naloxone and epinephrine by injection, and use automated external defibrillation, which are still regulated medical acts in Canada, although they are increasingly delegated to the general public.\n\nPrimary care paramedics (PCPs) are the entry level of paramedic practice across Canada. The scope of practice includes performing semi-automated external defibrillation, manual defibrillation, oxygen administration, ETCO2 monitoring, supraglottic airways, vascular access, cardiac monitoring such as Lead 2 interpretation and 12 Lead acquisition and interpretation, and administration of Symptom Relief Medications for a variety of emergency medical conditions (these include epinephrine, salbutamol, aspirin, nitroglycerine, naloxone, dextrose, glucagon, gravol, ketorolac, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, benadryl). PCPs may also receive additional authorization in order to perform certain skills that are normally in the scope of practice of ACPs.\n\nThe Advanced Care Paramedic is a level of practitioner that is in high demand by many services across Canada. The ACP typically carries approximately 20 different medications, although the number and type of medications may vary substantially from region to region. ACPs perform advanced airway management including intubation, surgical airways, intravenous therapy, place external jugular IV lines, perform needle thoracostomy, perform and interpret 12-lead ECGs, perform synchronized and chemical cardioversion, transcutaneous pacing, perform obstetrical assessments, and provide pharmacological pain relief for various conditions. Several sites in Canada have adopted pre-hospital fibrinolytics and rapid sequence induction, and prehospital medical research has permitted a great number of variations in the scope of practice for ACPs.\n\nCurrent bypass protocols include providing both PCPs and ACPs with discretionary direct 24-hour access to PCI labs, bypassing the emergency department, and representing a fundamental change in both the way that patients with S-T segment elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMI) are treated, but also profoundly affecting survival rates. as well as bypassing a closer hospitals to get an identified stroke patient to a stroke centre.\n\nTraining for specialization as a paramedic is most often provided by employers who select paramedics that have gone through an internal competition. There are very few specialization education programs open to the public currently. Most specializations require the applicant to already be an experienced advanced care paramedic.\n\nCritical care paramedics' expertise focus on critical and ICU level care, stabilizing and transporting patients from smaller hospitals with less available resources to tertiary care, and regional medical programs in to other hospitals that can provide a higher level of care. CCPs generally work with an ACP, registered nurse, physician, or another CCP. Sometimes ad hoc teams, with multiple practitioners (RTs, emergency physicians, surgeons, etc.) are assembled for certain patients.\n\nCCPs are able to provide all of the care that PCPs and ACPs provide. In addition to this they are trained for other skills such as medication infusion pumps, mechanical ventilation and arterial line monitoring.\n\nCCPs often work in fixed and rotary wing aircraft when the weather permits and staff are available, but systems such as the Toronto EMS Critical Care Transport Program work in land ambulances. ORNGE Transport operates both land and aircraft in Ontario. In British Columbia, CCP's work primarily in aircraft with a dedicated Critical Care Transport crew in several cities for long-distance/high acuity transfers and as regular CCP street crews who may do major trauma calls or, performs medevacs, when necessary.\n\nAcross the prairies, STARS Shock Trauma Air Rescue Society uses rotary wing aircraft to reach many in isolated communities and traumatic situations for faster response time than by ground ambulance. In Saskatchewan they also use fixed wing air ambulances. The service, called LIFEGUARD, can respond a greater distance and to more northern communities than STARS. Sask air ambulance service was the first non-military air ambulance service in the world. These air ambulances are crewed by Flight Nurses and CCPs.\n\nTactical paramedics are specialized paramedics who undergo additional training to allow them to perform their usual task in a high risk and dangerous scenario. Some are trained to handle weapons, rappel from buildings and other skills needed to work alongside tactical police units.\n\nThese paramedics are required to wear protective gear but are unarmed.\n\nOccupational health paramedics work closely with occupational physicians and nurses to help with pre-employment screening, medical surveillance programs and clinical testing for companies.\n\nThe newest level/role for paramedics in Canada, community paramedics work in clinics, hospitals, and in patient's homes. They provide immediate or scheduled primary, urgent and specialized healthcare to vulnerable patient populations by collaborating with other healthcare providers, conducting assessments, treating, and doing/ordering tests.\n\nDiagnostics provided by Community Paramedics: Specimen collection (blood, urine, swabs), 12/15 lead ECGs, vital signs (temperature, blood glucose, SPO2, side stream CO2, BP), and facilitate transports for diagnostic imaging.\n\nTreatments provided by Community Paramedics: CVC & IV rehydration, blood transfusions, urinary catheterization, wound closure & care (tissue adhesive, sutures, dressings), oxygen and nebulizer therapy, IV/SQ/IM/PO/PORT/PICC medication administration (including IV antibiotics), and coordination of community services.\n\nA type of specialisation in Alberta Metro areas, IRPs receive intensive training, including toxicology, hazmat chemistry, National Fire Protection Association hazmat awareness and operations certifications, as well as three weeks of CBRNE training, antidote, medical countermeasures, MCI, and protective equipment training.\n\nFor day-to-day operations, IRPs respond to hazmat- and toxicology-related incidents. They carry a wider range of medications than advanced care paramedics and more protective equipment, allowing them to better treat poisonings/overdoses and work closely with firefighters and hazmat technicians.\n\nIn some of Canada, paramedics do not work under their own medical license. Some exceptions are in British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta where each paramedic regardless of level, has their own license to practice. In Ontario, paramedics are permitted to perform regulated medical acts by the process of 'delegation'. This means that one physician, known as the medical director, has become familiar with the individual paramedic and then has delegated authority to that paramedic which allows them to perform specific regulated medical act under defined situations. The scope of practice for the paramedic is defined in paramedic protocols (also referred to as advanced medical directives). These protocols specify which skill and the conditions required for the paramedic to act. Each protocol is signed by the medical director. Medical directors are generally ER physicians who work in a hospital associated with the paramedic service. The relationship between this hospital ('Base Hospital') is formalized through legal agreements. Other physicians in the base hospital who are allowed to give direct orders to paramedics that exceed their protocols (often via telephone) are referred to as delegating physicians. These physicians are usually ER physicians.\n\nSome Canadian paramedics are moving towards the status of self-regulated health professionals with paramedics forming their own professional colleges in much the same manner as nurses and other health professions, the most recent being Nova Scotia launching in 2017. These organizations are responsible to the government for the examination and licensing of practitioners, the establishment of standards of practice, the investigation of public complaints against members, and the disciplining of members. They are also required to advise the government on all issues and legislation related to the practice of their members. Following the example of their British colleagues, Colleges or Associations have been established in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, with Ontario paramedics organizing and advocating towards this type of legislation.\n\nParamedics have a close relationship with the physicians who (in most systems) grant paramedics the legal right to practice their profession with a regulated paramedic service. Some systems in Canada are transitioning to a self regulated organization, where medical authority derives directly from legislation and self-regulation rather than the approval of a medical doctor. Also, because physician assistants in Canada exist primarily in the Canadian Forces, the role of clinical paramedic practitioners is under serious study. Both urban and rural centres have begun utilizing paramedics working in-hospital on cardiac arrest teams, patient transfer teams, emergency department triage/treatment and to facilitate faster \"off-load\" times.\n\nIn Halifax, NS, ACPs and PCPs work side by side with physicians in various emergency departments within the Capital District Health Authority. The responsibilities of these department paramedics varies from ER to ER within CDHA but include advanced airway stabilization, suturing, minor treatment as well as other expanded paramedic roles such as procedural sedations. They have also proven a necessary and integral member of the cardiac arrest and trauma teams. PCPs have been employed by CDHA since the early 1990s to perform triage assessments.\n\nParamedics often work long hours; with a variety of 8-, 10-, 12- and 14-hour shifts. In some areas, however, 24- and even 96-hour shifts are not unusual. Salary and benefits are generally commensurate with the level of education and certification, though often less than the salary expectations of police officers and firefighters. This incongruity is often argued as being unfair, especially in light of the relative level of responsibility a paramedic may have for acting decisively and without having direct supervision. However, many paramedics consider their career to offer intangible benefits and reported job satisfaction is generally high. Due to the challenging working conditions, paramedics, similarly to other first responders, are at a greatly increased risk to develop Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder as compared to the general population.\n\nParamedics in Canada generally work only as paramedics, but occasionally are cross-trained as firefighters, security contractor, search and rescue or law enforcement officers, and most are paid full or part-time professionals. In the first quarter of 2005, paramedics were granted status federally as a \"Public Safety Occupation\" which means that paramedics are now eligible for early retirement, as are police officers and fire fighters. Many EMS agencies run a full range of paramedic specialty squads including: Marine medics, Bike medics, First Response medics, Tactical ERT & CCU medics, CBRNe medics (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosive) and USAR medics (Urban Search And Rescue - specializing in urban disaster rescue recovery) and finally NOHERT medics (members of Provincial or regional Health Emergency Response Teams)\n\nParamedic wages in Canada vary depending on province and experience, but a \"typical part-time annual salary for this occupation is in the region of $45,000 – $65,000.\" However, some jurisdictions and special qualifications provide far greater salaries: Paramedics in Ontario have an annual salary roughly starting from $70,000 to $90,000 as a Primary Care Paramedic, an Advanced Care Paramedic's salary can on average range from $80,000 to $100,000, and Critical Care Paramedics range from $100,000 to $135,000. Education background, experience, and level of practice all are contributing factors to which salary is established.\n\n"}

Buckler drew virtually every major character at Marvel and DC, often as a cover artist.\n\nAs a teenager in Detroit, Buckler attended the initial iterations of the Detroit Triple Fan Fair, eventually running the convention along with originator Robert Brosch in 1969–1970.\n\nBuckler's first comics work was as a teenager with the four-page historical story \"Freedom Fighters: Washington Attacks Trenton\" in the King Features comic book \"Flash Gordon\" #10 (cover-dated Nov. 1967). In 1971, he did some work for Skywald Publications but made a \"wrong move\" by attempting to date the daughter of Skywald's co-owner Israel Waldman. At DC Comics, he drew the \"Rose and the Thorn\" backup stories in \"Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane\" #117–121 (Dec. 1971–April 1972).\n\nBuckler drew the first three issues of writer Don McGregor's Black Panther series in \"Jungle Action\" vol. 2, #6–8 (Sept. 1973–Jan. 1974), a run that Comics Bulletin in 2010 ranked third on its list of the \"Top 10 1970s Marvels\". He fulfilled a decade-long dream in 1974 when assigned to draw Marvel's flagship series, \"Fantastic Four\", on which he stayed for two years. During this period, Buckler created the cyborg antihero Deathlok, who starred in an ongoing feature debuting in \"Astonishing Tales\" #25 (Aug. 1974). Also during this period, Buckler hired the young George Pérez as his studio assistant.\n\nBuckler collaborated with writer Gerry Conway on a \"Superman vs. Shazam!\" story published in \"All-New Collectors' Edition\" #C-58 (April 1978). He drew the newspaper comic strip \"The Incredible Hulk\" for approximately six months in 1979. A Justice League story by Conway and Buckler originally intended for \"All-New Collectors' Edition\" saw print in \"Justice League of America\" #210–212 (Jan.–March 1983). Buckler and Roy Thomas then created the World War II superhero team the All-Star Squadron in a special insert in \"Justice League of America\" #193 (Aug. 1981) which led to the team's own title the following month.\n\nIn 1983,\"The Comics Journal\" accused Buckler of plagiarism, saying that he had a reputation as a \"swipe\" artist who copied poses and layouts from previous artists' work. Buckler sued the magazine for libel, but later dropped the suit.\n\nBuckler worked for Archie Comics in 1983 and 1984, when that publisher briefly revived its Red Circle Comics superhero line, and he recruited Cary Burkett to write the \"Mighty Crusaders\" title. In 1985, Buckler returned to Marvel and briefly drew \"The Spectacular Spider-Man\" with writer Peter David, where they produced the storyline \"The Death of Jean DeWolff\". He also served as editor for a short-lived line of comics by Solson Publications, where in 1987 he created \"Reagan's Raiders\".\n\nIn 2011, he drew a \"Djustine\" short story written by Enrico Teodorani for the Italian market.\nHe was the author of two books: \"How to Become a Comic Book Artist\" and \" How to Draw Superheroes \". In 2015, he became an Inkwell Awards Ambassador. It was not uncommon for him to use the alias Ron Validar or simply Validar for his Marvel comics work when he was on exclusive contract with rival DC. In this way he was able to skirt the spirit of the law if not the letter. His most prominent covers using this nome de plume were often inked by Ernie Chan.\n\nBuckler died May 19, 2017 after a long battle with cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Their song \"Mississippi\" was a #1 hit in most European countries, including the UK, in 1975/76. \n\nPrior to forming the band, the three sisters were telephone operators in Limburg, whilst Theunissen, Wetzles and Coumans were in a group called Scum. Lou Willé played in a group called Ricky Rendall and His Centurions until he married Toni, and created the group Sweet Reaction that eventually became known as Pussycat.\nIn 1975 they scored a big European hit with the song \"Mississippi\". However they had to wait a further year for the single to make the British charts when it climbed to number one in the UK Singles Chart in October 1976. Penned by Werner Theunissen, who had been the sisters' guitar teacher, it is estimated that \"Mississippi\" sold over five million copies worldwide. It was followed by \"Smile\" in 1976, and \"Hey Joe\" in 1978. Other hits were \"If You Ever Come to Amsterdam\", \"Georgie\", \"Wet Day in September\" and \"My Broken Souvenirs\". Their career in Europe spanned more than a decade and included some seventeen albums. By 1978 Hans Lutjens had replaced Coumans on drums, as the band continued to release albums and tour, travelling as far afield as South Africa. They made regular appearances on the West German TV series, \"Musikladen\", in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2212435", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2212435", "title": "Charles-Alexandre Léon Durand Linois", "text": "Charles-Alexandre Léon Durand Linois\n\nCharles-Alexandre Léon Durand, Comte de Linois (27 January 1761 – 2 December 1848) was a French admiral who served in the French Navy during the reign Napoleon Bonaparte. He commanded the combined Franco-Spanish fleet during the Algeciras Campaign in 1801, winning the First Battle of Algeciras before losing the Second Battle of Algeciras. He then led an unsuccessful campaign against British trade in the Indian Ocean and South China Sea in 1803, being defeated by a harmless fleet of the East India Company during the Battle of Pulo Aura and ending his cruise and career being bested in battle by John Warren in the Action of 13 March 1806.\n\nBorn in Brest, Linois joined the French Navy as a volunteer in 1776, when he was 15 years old. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1791 after participating in the American War of Independence. From 1791 to 1793 he was posted to Isle de France (now Mauritius) where he served in the French forces in the Indian Ocean.\n\nAfter his return to France in 1794, he was based in Brest. Linois was captured by the Royal Navy at the Action of 7 May 1794 while his ship was protecting a convoy of wheat from the United States. He was exchanged and promoted to captain, taking command of the 74-gun \"Formidable\". The following year he was captured again at the battle of Groix, where he was twice wounded and lost an eye; he was again exchanged. In 1796 he took part in the Expédition d'Irlande as a chief of division, leading a 3-ship of the line and 4-frigate squadron, with his flag on \"Nestor\". Arrived in Bantry Bay, the generals opposed a landing, and the squadron headed back to Brest, taking three prizes on the way.\n\nOn 12 April 1796 he was captain of \"Unité\" when captured her. \"Revolutionnaire\" had no casualties because the French had fired high, aiming for her rigging; the British fired into their quarry with the result that \"Unité\" suffered nine men killed and 11 wounded.\n\nIn 1799 Linois was promoted to Rear-Admiral (contre-amiral) and sent to the Mediterranean under Admiral Bruix. As second in command of the squadron under Admiral Ganteaume, he attacked Elba in 1801. Then in command of a small squadron based in Cadiz, he fought a larger British squadron under Sir James Saumarez in the Battle of Algeciras. His squadron prevailed during the first part of the battle, capturing HMS \"Hannibal\", but on the return to Cadiz, two Spanish ships who had joined him were fooled into firing on each other by a British night attack and were lost.\n\nIn 1803 Napoleon Bonaparte appointed him to command the French forces in the Indian Ocean and, flying his flag aboard the 74-gun-ship \"Marengo\", he harried British merchant ships across the ocean and into the China Seas. At the Battle of Pulo Aura in 1804, a squadron of French naval ships commanded by Linois encountered the British China Fleet of lightly armed merchant ships. The British ships outnumbered Linois' forces, manoeuvred as though preparing to defend themselves, and some flew naval ensigns. The tactics of the convoy commodore Nathaniel Dance fooled Linois into believing that the British fleet was defended by naval escorts and he retired without attacking the virtually defenceless British.\n\nDuring his squadron's return to France, Linois encountered a large British squadron under Admiral Warren off Cape Verde. In their engagement, known as the Action of 13 March 1806, Linois was wounded and captured again. Napoleon had ended the practice of exchanging officers and Linois remained a prisoner of war until Napoleon fell in 1814. In 1810, while held by the British, Linois was named comte de Linois by Napoleon.\n\nFollowing the Bourbon restoration, Louis XVIII named him to be Governor of Guadeloupe but as Linois supported Napoleon during the Hundred Days he was forced to resign after the battle of Waterloo. He was court martialled but acquitted in 1816. However, he was placed in retirement and never served again, although he was appointed as an honorary Vice-Admiral (vice-amiral) in 1825.\nHe lived in Versailles, where he died in 1848.\n\nHis name is inscribed on the Arc de Triomphe.\n\nLinois is a minor, but highly respected, character in the Aubrey–Maturin series by Patrick O'Brian. Frederick Marryat describes the Battle of Pulo Aura in his 1832 novel \"Newton Forster, or The Merchant Service\".\n"}

The contest, which has been broadcast every year since its debut in 1956, is one of the longest-running television programmes in the world. The contest's winner has been determined using numerous voting techniques throughout its history; centre to these have been the awarding of points to countries by juries or televoters. The country awarded the most points is declared the winner. The first Eurovision Song Contest was not won on points, but by votes (two per country), and only the winner was announced.\nThere have been 64 contests, with one winner each year except the tied 1969 contest, which had four. Twenty-seven countries have won the contest. Switzerland won the first contest in 1956. The country with the highest number of wins is Ireland, with seven. The only person to have won more than once as performer is Ireland's Johnny Logan, who performed \"What's Another Year\" in 1980 and \"Hold Me Now\" in 1987. Logan is also one of only five songwriters to have written more than one winning entry (\"Hold Me Now\" 1987 and \"Why Me?\" 1992, performed by Linda Martin). This unique distinction makes Logan the only person to have three Eurovision victories to his/her credit, as either singer, songwriter or both. The other four songwriters with more than one winning entry to their credit are, Willy van Hemert (Netherlands, 1957 and 1959), Yves Dessca (Monaco, 1971 and Luxembourg, 1972), Rolf Løvland (Norway, 1985 and 1995) and Brendan Graham (Ireland, 1994 and 1996).\n\nWinning the Eurovision Song Contest provides a unique opportunity for the winning artist(s) to capitalise on their success and surrounding publicity by launching or furthering their international career during their singing years. However, throughout the history of the contest, relatively few of these artists have gone on to be huge international stars. The most notable winning Eurovision artists whose career was directly launched into the spotlight following their win were the members of ABBA, who won the 1974 contest for Sweden with their song \"Waterloo\". ABBA went on to be one of the most successful bands of its time. Another notable winner who subsequently achieved international fame and success was Céline Dion, who won the 1988 contest for Switzerland with the song \"Ne partez pas sans moi\".\n\nSince 2008, the winner has been awarded an official winner's trophy of the Eurovision Song Contest. The trophy is a handmade piece of sandblasted glass in the shape of a 1950s microphone. The song writers and composers of the winning entry receive smaller versions of the trophy. The original design was created by Kjell Engman of Kosta Boda, who specialises in glass art.\n\nThe following individuals have won the Eurovision Song Contest as a performer or songwriter more than once. Bold indicates a win as a performer. \"Italics\" indicates a win as a songwriter.\nEleven Eurovision winners (alongside three non-winners) featured at the \"Congratulations\" concert in 2005, in which ABBA's \"Waterloo\" was voted the most popular song of the contest's first fifty years.\n\nIreland has finished first seven times, more than any other country, Ireland also won the contest for three consecutive years (1992, 1993, 1994), more consecutive years than any other country. Three countries have won twice in a row, Spain (1968 and 1969), Luxembourg (1972 and 1973) and Israel (1978 and 1979). Serbia is the only country to win with its debut entry (in 2007), though Serbia had competed previously as part of Yugoslavia and Serbia and Montenegro. The country achieving the highest position on its first appearance in any form in the Contest is Poland, which came second in 1994 (even Switzerland in 1956 won with its second entry of the night). Under the voting system used between 1975 and 2015, the winner of the contest was decided by the final voting nation on eleven occasions.\n\nChanges to the voting system, including a steady growth in the number of countries participating and voting, means that the points earned are not comparable across the decades. Portugal's Salvador Sobral holds the record of the highest number of points in the contest's history, earning 758 with the song \"Amar pelos dois\". Norway's Alexander Rybak holds the largest margin of victory in absolute points, a 169-point cushion over second place in 2009. Italy's Gigliola Cinquetti holds the record for largest victory by percentage, scoring almost three times as many as second place (49 points compared with 17 by the runner-up) in the 1964 contest. Under the voting system used from 1975 until 2015, the lowest winning score was Norway's Bobbysocks! 123 points earned (of the 216 available from the 18 other countries) when winning Eurovision 1985, while the lowest winning total ever is the 18 points (of the 160 total votes cast by 16 countries) scored by each of the four winning countries in 1969.\n\nUnder the voting system used from 1975 until 2015, in which each country gives maximum points to its first place choice, Sweden's Loreen won Eurovision 2012 with the most ever first place votes earned, receiving first place votes from 18 of 41 countries (excluding themselves). The 1976 United Kingdom entrant, Brotherhood of Man with the song \"Save Your Kisses For Me\" holds the record of the highest average score per participating country, with an average of 9.65 points received per country. 2011 winner Azerbaijan Ell & Nikki, hold the lowest average score for a winning song under that system, receiving 5.14 points per country.\n\nIn 2016, Jamala's \"1944\" became the first winning entry since the jury vote was added alongside the televote starting in 2009 to place first in neither area, coming second in the jury vote behind Australia and second in the televote behind Russia. Duncan Laurence's \"Arcade,\" became the second such winner in the 2019 contest, having placed third behind North Macedonia and Sweden in the jury vote, and second behind Norway in the televote.\n\nThe United Kingdom has finished second fifteen times at Eurovision (most recently in 1998), more than any other country. The most successful country never to have won the Contest is Malta, having finished second in 2002 and 2005 and third in 1992 and 1998. Another island nation Iceland has also finished second twice, in 1999 and 2009.\n\nThere is no official runner-up for two of the contests – 1956 and 1969. In 1956 only the winner, Switzerland, was announced, whilst there were speculative reports that Germany ended up in second place with \"Im Wartesaal zum großen Glück\" by Walter Andreas Schwarz, given that Germany was chosen to host the 1957 contest. In 1969 four songs shared first place by achieving the same number of points; fifth place was achieved by Switzerland, which is not considered an official runner-up, because of the draw for first place.\n\nYear 1969 is in \"italics\" to indicate a joint (4-way) win\n\nBetween 1966 and 1973, and again between 1977 and 1998, countries were only permitted to perform in their own language; see the main Eurovision Song Contest article.\n\n\n"}

He also was a Sinologist who made pioneering translations. (His name's official Chinese translation is 駱克 (Cantonese: Lok Hak).)\n\nBorn as James Haldane Lockhart in Ardsheal, Argyllshire, Scotland, his parents were Anna Rebecca Charlotte Stewart and Miles Lockhart of Lismore, Argyll. His grandfather was banker James Lockhart. He attended King William's College (1868–72), George Watson's College, and the University of Edinburgh, and attempted to enter the civil service in India. Failing to do that, Lockhart took a Colonial Service cadetship in Hong Kong in 1878.\n\nAfter joining the Hong Kong Government in 1882, Lockhart rose through the ranks of Hong Kong's civil service. He was Registrar General and Colonial Secretary of Hong Kong, and later became Commissioner of Weihaiwei (1902–1927), the British coastal enclave returned to China in 1930. He had a more positive relationship with Hong Kong Chinese due to this knowledge of Cantonese and was friends with Ho Kai. Lockhart was made a member of the Hong Kong Legislative and Executive Councils.\n\nHe founded the Hong Kong Football Club in 1886, situated within the Happy Valley Racecourse. The club now plays host to the Hong Kong 10s rugby tournament.\n\nWhile they were both training in Hong Kong, Lockhart became friends with Reginald Johnston, who made his reputation while serving in Weihaiwei. Both men devoted great energy to their studies of Chinese language and classical literature, and both published scholarly works. Johnston was also a great emotional support to Lockhart and his family. Johnston later wrote that since Lockhart had a sound training in Greek and Latin at Edinburgh University, he took easily to the study of Chinese, another classical language. \"The China Review\", a journal for scholarly work by China coast foreigners, published Lockhart's early work, which mainly concerned linguistic questions. Lockhart was fluent in Cantonese, Johnston reported, and acquired a working knowledge of Mandarin when he was posted to Weihaiwei.\n\nLockhart was particularly interested in collecting and studying Chinese coins, and he produced several publications on numismatics. He also made a thorough study of Chinese art and literature, and formed a large collection of paintings, ink rubbings and decorative arts, some of which was displayed in 1928. The collection was donated by his daughter, Betty Joel, to his \"alma mater\", George Watson's College, and is currently on a long-term loan to the National Museum of Scotland. Lockhart's Chinese books were purchased by Cambridge University Library; his photographs are on loan to the Scottish National Portrait Gallery.\n\nAfter retiring from the Colonial Service, Lockhart returned to Britain. He became an honorary member of the Royal Asiatic Society and member of the School of Oriental Studies at the University of London.\n\nHis appointment of CMG was signed by Queen Victoria on 21 May 1898, while his appointment of KCMG was signed by King Edward VII on 9 November 1908. He received an honorary LLD degree from the University of Hong Kong in 1918.\n\nLockhart Road in Wan Chai, Hong Kong Island, is named after him.\n\nIn 1889, Lockhart married Edith Louise Rider Hancock. They had one son and two daughters: Charles, Mary (known by her married and professional name Betty Joel), and Margaret. He returned with his family to England in 1927 and died in London in 1937.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2212451", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2212451", "title": "Paramedics in Germany", "text": "Paramedics in Germany\n\nParamedics in Germany are the main providers of emergency care in emergency medical services in Germany. There exist two professional levels regulated by federal law, the \"Rettungsassistent\" (two year education, effective 1989 until 2013) and the \"Notfallsanitäter\" (three year education, starting 2014).\n\nBoth are able to provide the first level of pre-hospital emergency care. Additionally, they can get backup by an emergency physician on scene. Thus the German paramedic scope of skills include a set of advanced life support (ALS) treatments, which they have to perform until an emergency doctor is on scene. Then the paramedics (and other medical staff on scene) act under direct medical supervision of the physician.\n\nNon life-threatening emergencies are handled solely by the paramedic ambulances without a physician on scene.\n\nOther regulated qualifications in German EMS are \"Notarzt\" (emergency physician) and the more basic emergency technician level \"Rettungssanitäter\".\n\nThe development of ambulance services in Germany started in the late 19th century. Typically volunteer aid organizations, some private companies in larger cities and so called rescue corps provided ambulance services mostly with very little training or medical background. This more or less lasted until the 1960s: emergency care was provided by volunteer organizations or untrained \"ambulance men\".\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, however, it became obvious, that a more professional approach is needed. The sending of physicians to the scene was introduced, following the concept \"\"bringing the doctor to the patient, not the patient to the doctor\"\". The development of the system \"\"emergency physician\"\" (\"Notarzt\") started, bearing the need for somewhat qualified assistance on scene. A law to establish the occupation of \"Rettungssanitäter\" has been discussed, with a 3-year training curriculum. The government however saw difficulties in financing the training of this new profession. So, eventually in 1977 the original idea was introduced as a 3.5 month (520 hours) training curriculum common to all Länder (federal states) of Germany. This led to a more professionalized approach, but clearly below the level of the intended original law. By the 1980s it became clear that many situations were occurring in which the knowledge level of the \"Rettungssanitäter\" was inadequate, especially in cases where a \"Notarzt\" wasn't available in time. The developing of pre-clinical procedures demanded additional qualification for treating patients in the field. It was deemed necessary to find a new profession with even more knowledge and skills.\n\nThis was when, in 1989, the profession of the \"Rettungsassistent\" was created, introducing a two-year education program. In contrast to the \"Rettungssanitäter\", the Rettungsassistent was a state-certified profession with a job title protected by law. Since then, EMS in Germany has evolved into a formal, well organized structure, with standards for staff training, vehicles, and service delivery. Formerly \"Rettungssanitäter\" trained providers could get an upgrade to the new profession with proof of 2000 hours experience in EMS. The \"Rettungssanitäter\" still exists as a common entry/assistance level for EMS, for volunteer work and industrial emergency medicine.\n\nHowever, the \"Rettungsassistent\" remained subject to discussion, especially regarding length of education, scope of practice, autonomy in emergency situations and differentation to other medical professions, including paygrade. The problems mainly were seen in the early state exam after just one year in EMS school (the additional internship in EMS wasn't part of examination), the more or less undefined curriculum, the main focus on bare assistance to a physician, the possible side entry for other medical professions and the de facto requirement for students to pay for the entire education.\n\nAround 20 years after the introduction of \"Rettungsassistent\" law, the German EMS community targeted to an enhanced qualification. Eventually in the year 2013, the law about the \"Notfallsanitäter\" came into effect. With January 2014, no more starting courses for the old \"Rettungsassistent\" were possible. The \"Notfallsanitäter\" law addressed much of the concerns, thus providing a real three year education with a well defined curriculum targeted more on autonomous handling of emergency situations, requirement of a (paid) contract with an employer during education and no side entries for other professions. Former \"Rettungsassistenten\" can decide to stay in their duty (the title still is protected) or (time limited until end of 2020) upgrade to \"Notfallsanitäter\" by taking courses and a supplemental state exam.\n\nThe scope of practice of a German paramedic is not specifically defined by a decent law. Thus the allowed standard procedures largely depend on the local medical director and the employer. However, in life-threatening situations, a \"Rettungsassistent\" or \"Notfallsanitäter\" always has to perform autonomously first diagnosis/monitoring and all necessary ALS treatments until an emergency physician arrives. This includes airway management (clearing airway and oropharyngeal, subglottic and endotracheal intubation), intravenous cannulation and application of crystalloid solutions, basic medication (adrenaline, glucose, inhaled ß2 agonists/bronchodilators, rectal benzodiazepine, glyceryl trinitrate, analgetics) and resuscitation with an automated external defibrillator.\n\nUsually not included are intraosseous infusion, medical assisted rapid sequence induction, surgical airway management, decompression of tension pneumothorax and advanced medication. However, this may be trained and allowed, especially for special settings, such as military or remote medical care (i.e. on ships).\n\nRestrictions in treatment are the scope of training and practice, some laws restricting decent methods to physicians (i.e. medication with specific controlled substances such as opiates) and the fact that concluding therapies are restricted to physicians and licensed practitioners only, with exceptions to certain emergency procedures opened to the \"Notfallsanitäter\". An emergency physician should be called to scene if he can perform other life saving tasks the patient needs, usually regulated by a physicians indication catalogue (\"\"Notarzt-Indikationskatalog\"\") depending of the service and state.\n\nThe definition of skills in the \"Rettungsassistent\" education law ist not very specific, whereas the definition in the \"Notfallsanitäter\" law is very specific in which skills have to be mastered, trained or only known of. Thus, the scope of practice of a \"Notfallsanitäter\" is based on a well defined education, which may lead to a wider range of accepted standard procedures, including intraosseous access, extraglottic airway, thorax punction, manual defibrillation and cardioversion, external pacing as well as more drugs including opiates. However, detailed regulations still are in discussion as of now.\n\nBeside specific topics such as resuscitation, the use of algorithms in daily work is not usual in German EMS, although they are used in training.\n\nStanding orders, pre-delegated authority and telemetry consultation are not common. Delegating physician's work is legally difficult and not really needed, since emergency physicians can be called to come directly on scene. Until then, the paramedic is allowed to perform needed procedures within his skills on his own. Telemetry is mainly used to provide the receiving hospital with data for organising appropriate help in-house.\n\nStandard order procedures exist, but giving the emergency staff (including physicians) a wide range of possibilities.\n\nEssentially, emergency medicine in Germany heavily relies on evidence based guidelines provided by the main bodies of medical scientific organisations. Providers of (emergency) medicine have to keep up with the changes in those guidelines.\n\nThe theoretical education for German paramedics include:\n\nFurthermore, the student is taught skills in treating patients, including:\n\nThe \"Rettungsassistent\" (female: \"Rettungsassistentin\") was a two-year education program, established in 1989. This program ended in the year 2013 with the introduction of the three year education program of the \"Notfallsanitäter\" (see below).\n\nLiterally, the term means \"rescue assistant\", meaning that those in this role assist the \"Notarzt\" during pre-hospital treatment.\n\nThe \"Notfallsanitäter\" law of 2013 outdated the \"Rettungsassistent\", effective with beginning of 2014. The title \"Rettungsassistent\" still is protected by law and those who have this education can perform their duty, but there will be no more starting classes for \"Rettungsassistent\" since January 2014.\n\nTo be allowed to start EMS school an applicant had to be 18 years old and generally healthy. The needed school education was a basic level certificate of secondary education (\"Hauptschulabschluss\") or similar, alternative a vocational training.\n\nSpecific side entries with shortened courses were defined for applicants with existing \"Rettungssanitäter\" education, nurses, active soldiers and police officers with medical training. Another professional education could have been accredited by authorities in general.\n\nThe first phase of education included classroom and hospital clinical. It took 1200 hours, this is about one year full-time. A state licensed examination after this first stage permitted the candidate to begin a 1600 hours preceptorship in the pre-hospital setting.\n\nIn this second year they usually started as a third person on a transport ambulance in order to observe and learn from the trained professionals. Sometimes, paramedic students who also had the qualification of \"Rettungssanitäter\" were used as a full crew member on a two-person team. However, at all times the student was under supervision by a \"Lehrrettungsassistent\".\n\nAfter completing their year of internship, there was a closing meeting with the training physician and the supervising paramedic. After that, should the student have been deemed fit, he or she was awarded the vocational title of \"Rettungsassistent\" (female: \"Rettungsassistentin\"). The certificate then was issued by the state Ministry of Health and valid nationwide.\n\nThe objectives of education was defined as being able to perform life saving action to emergency patients on scene until a physician takes over, establish transportability of such patients, monitor and support vital body functions during transportation to a hospital and transport ill, injured or other needy persons - even if non-emergency patients - with appropriate care. The description of the scope in the law largely placed emphasis on the assistance to a physician. By law the education has to enable the Notfallsanitäter to perform following tasks on his own: scene assessment and security, assessment of patients especially detecting vital threats, decision about calling in assistance, medical treatment of patients including invasive actions, handling of people in crisis situations, establishing and securing transportability of patients, selection of an appropriate transportation target, monitoring, reporting to receiving facility, documentation, communication, quality management, operational responsibilities for equipment including care for hygiene and accident prevention, assisting in medical treatments under supervision of a physician, independent treatment as ordered by a physician, self-responsible medical treatment according to rules given by a medical director, cooperation with other professions.[26]\n\nEducation as \"Rettungsassistent\" was mostly offered by privately owned but state certified EMS schools (\"Rettungsassistenten-Schule\"). Mostly the students had to pay for their own training, rarely a future employer paid. Usual exceptions were firefighters, policemen and members of the armed forces for whom their employer covered the fees. Costs depended on school, they varied around €4000 for a full course. With a pre-existing EMS training, a shortened course was available, for fees of about €2750. Side entry for nurses were possible, omitting several medical topics, remaining fees of about €1800. Public funding and sponsorship were possible in certain cases.\n\nThe \"Notfallsanitäter\" (female: \"Notfallsanitäterin\") is a three-year education program, established since January 2014.\n\nLiterally, the term means \"emergency medic\", underlining the more advanced skills for pre-hospital emergency medicine.\n\nTo be allowed to start EMS school an applicant has to be generally healthy. The needed school education is a higher leveled certificate of secondary education (\"Mittlere Reife\"), alternative a basic level certificate of secondary education (\"Hauptschulabschluss\") with an additional vocational training of at least two years.\n\nUniversity based programs may exist, then a secondary education certification for university entrance (\"Abitur\") is needed.\n\nThe applicant has to get contracted (and paid) by an employer during his apprenticeship. The employer then organizes the education together with an EMS school.\n\nSince it is mandatory to have a contract during the education period there is almost no way to get the \"Notfallsanitäter\" qualification on own expenses, only exception would be for university students in emergency related degree programs (and, technically, for public servants, i.e. career fire fighters or police officers).\n\nThere is no defined side entry for other medical professions, only a general rule for authorities enabling them accredition of other educations.\n\nA time limited transition rule for holders of the now outdated \"Rettungsassistent\" certification is valid until the end of the year 2020. It requires mandatory courses dependent on time of work experience and a supplemental state exam, alternative attending the full state exam for \"Notfallsanitäter\".\n\nThe three year education of the \"Notfallsanitäter\" consists of min. 1920 hours theoretical and practical classroom instruction, an EMS internship of min. 1960 hours and an hospital internship of min. 720 hours, followed by a state exam. The EMS school, EMS station (internship) and training hospital has to be officially recognised.\n\nGenerally, the law gives following objectives for the education: A \"Notfallsanitäter\" has to be qualified to perform according to scientific standards and with technical, personal, social and methodic competence for sole responsibility and team oriented work especially in emergency medical treatment und transport of patients. By law the education has to enable the \"Notfallsanitäter\" to perform following tasks on his own: scene assessment and security, assessment of patients especially detecting vital threats, decision about calling in assistance, medical treatment of patients including invasive actions, handling of people in crisis situations, establishing and securing transportability of patients, selection of an appropriate transportation target, monitoring, reporting to receiving facility, documentation, communication, quality management, operational responsibilities for equipment including care for hygiene and accident prevention, assisting in medical treatments under supervision of a physician, independent treatment as ordered by a physician, self-responsible medical treatment according to rules given by a medical director, cooperation with other professions.\n\nThe educational guidelines to reach these competences are described in the according federal regulation for education and examination, \"Ausbildungs- und Prüfungsverordnung für Notfallsanitäterinnen und Notfallsanitäter (NotSan-APrV)\".\n\nSee also article \"Emergency medical services in Germany\".\n\nOther qualifications in EMS include the Emergency Physician (\"Notarzt\"), providing medical direction to all subordinate EMS staff, once on scene. If needed, emergency physicians are dispatched along with a paramedic ambulance according to several standard dispatch criteria (indication catalogue, \"\"Notarzt-Indikationskatalog\"\").\n\nOther level qualifications enabling a person to work in EMS are the \"Rettungssanitäter\" (ILS-Paramedic with 520 hour training) and \"Rettungshelfer\" (BLS and driver, not standardized, around 240 hours out of the \"Rettungssanitäter\" curriculum).\n\n\"Sanitäter\" technically is a person just with advanced first aid training (40-70 hrs) according to organization or company regulations, often staffing the first aid posts at events, volunteering in local first responder units or assisting in disaster response, nowadays rarely as crew member (driver) of an ambulance.\n\nHowever, it is also the general public's term for \"medical ambulance staff\" in Germany, although recognized a bit offensive by EMS professionals.\n\nAfter successfully completing EMS education and holding the state exam, paramedics in Germany do not need to be recertified. However, most German states and/or some employers require yearly training for serving in professional EMS: mostly around 30 hours.\n\nAdditionally, special recertification requirements exists for courses like ACLS, PALS, ITLS and PHTLS which are increasingly required by employers within the EMS system.\n\nTypically, paramedics are responsible for patient care on EMS ambulances. He or she may also act as assistant/driver for the car of an emergency physician (\"Notarzt\").\n\nParamedic work includes positions in industry and occupational health.\n\nAdditionally to their regular field job, paramedics in Germany can obtain positions as QM-Beauftragter (quality management representative) and MPG-Beauftragter (medical equipment representative), which are administrative roles, often required by laws and regulations to be fulfilled in EMS organizations.\nReal career steps are Wachleiter (station commander), Schichtleiter (shift commander) and Rettungsdienstleiter (EMS chief). Those require experience in the EMS field and additional administrative skills, often regulated by state laws.\n\nAnother speciality is the HEMS crew member training, after which the \"Rettungsassistent\" or \"Notfallsanitäter\" is certified to work on a rescue helicopter. This role includes assisting both the pilot (i.e. navigating, spotting landing sites) during flight, and assisting the emergency physician with medical care.\n\nThe qualification of Lehrrettungsassistent or Praxisanleiter Rettungsdienst is to teach and supervise paramedic students during their training. Those seeking this role receive special training in which they learn education theory and the use of teaching strategies.\n\nThe qualification of Einsatzleiter Rettungsdienst and Organisatorischer Leiter (EMS/incident commander) is closely related to mass casualties and will be responsible for organizing staging, triage, treatment and transport as well as communication. Often that is a part-time position for paramedics beside their usual shifts.\n\nA Leitstellendisponent works in a dispatch center. Part of their education is obtaining a medical level plus additional skills (i.e. firefighting, communications).\n\nOften, hospitals seek paramedics for the position as Emergency Room Specialist, performing their skills in emergency medicine and triage within a hospital setting.\n\nFurthermore, university degrees like Bachelor and Master Programs in Rescue Engineering or Health Care Management offer opportunities for German paramedics to take leadership roles in emergency health care systems and the general health care field.\n\nMarketing and sales positions as well as working in technical service or development for manufacturers of medical equipment could be an additional career move for paramedics.\n\nWages depends on the employer, the state, involved unions and the role and/or additional tasks. Nowadays, pay level could be more or less compared with that of a basic nurse. A typical average pay for a paramedic varies around €2000-€2600 per month (before taxes) for up to 48 hours per week. Additional income can be gained for shift work and assuming additional tasks. Usually, pay level ascends with seniority and experience.\n\nSince the education level of \"Rettungsassistent\" could be obtained by own expenses, the working market was very employer friendly. With the new \"Notfallsanitäter\" system, the number of paramedics in the system is restricted to a smaller number of paid and employed apprentices finishing their education. So a more employee friendly work market could be expected, influencing the pay grade in a positive way.\n\nOn the other hand, the general structure of German EMS is changing within the European union, more and more towards a time restricted contracting system, leading to heavy competition between organizations and companies. This may have a depressing influence on significant cost factors such as employees and their wages.\n\n"}

The road starts at Tsing Tsuen Road, where it travels through the northern part of the island. It ends at Route 3 and Route 8 on the western side of the island at a left-in/left-out interchange, from its eastern terminus. The road was first planned in 1998 to relieve traffic coming from Lantau. It was constructed in 1999, and was opened in February 2002.\n\nThe road starts at the border of the Tsing Ma Control Area, on the eastern exit ramps of the Tam Kon Shan Interchange and the western terminus of Tsing Tsuen Road. The road travels westward, with ramps reemerging from the interchange, which is surrounded by noise barriers. TYNCR then travels across multiple viaducts on the northern side of Tsing Yi, with hills south of the road, and the coastline north of it. About from the eastern terminus, TYNCR travels to Tam Kon Shan Road, near a shipyard and a cement factory. The exit ramp is accessible from westbound lanes, and the entrance ramp from Tam Kon Shan Road to eastbound lanes. The road continues eastward and ends at a left-in/left-out intersection, located east of the Lantau Link Visitors Centre. The interchange then connects to Routes 3 and 8.\n\nIn 2018, 23,440 vehicles travelled the part of the road between Tam Kon Shan Interchange West End and the slip roads to and from Tam Kon Shan Road which is classified as a Primary Distributor (PD) by the Transport Department, while 14,400 vehicles travelled the part of the road between Tsing Tsuen Road and Tam Kon Shan Interchange West End which is classified as a District Distributor (DD). The data are measured in average annual daily traffic (AADT), which measures the amount of traffic daily on average.\n\nPlanning for the road began around 1996, as part of the Tsing Ma Control Area, a small region of highways with special management. The road was to relieve the higher traffic traveling through Tsing Yi, especially with the new Hong Kong International Airport and developments in Lantau being built. The project included the road and its ramps, pedestrian pathways, noise barriers around the highway, surveillance system, and a maintenance centre in Tsing Yi. The Highways Department signed a contract with Gammon Construction Limited for HKD$775.6 million in February 1999, after it invited qualified contractors in October 1998. Construction began later that month. \n\nDuring construction, techniques were used to prevent air pollution. Water was sprayed on roads, vehicles, and other areas to keep dust from leaving the site. Multiple viaducts, road embankments, and retaining walls were constructed in the project, with a set of walls replaced after its footings were damaged. Construction of the traffic control system began in November 2000, after the Transport Department signed an agreement with ABB Industrial and Building Systems Limited. The road was opened on 2 February 2002, after Donald Tsang inaugurated the road in a ceremony on February 1. New speed limits were set to upon opening.\n\n"}

The population in 2016 was 6224.\n\nThe town is located in the northern Weinviertel region, near the Thaya river, directly at the border with South Moravia. The municipal area includes the cadastral communities of Hanfthal, Kottingneusiedl, Pernhofen, Ungerndorf, and Wulzeshofen.\n\nA settlement at a ford across the Thaya existed already in the 12th century, before the estates were acquired by the Babenberg dukes of Austria about 1190. Duke Leopold VI of Austria about 1230 had the walled town of Laa laid out as a strategic outpost at the border with the Kingdom of Bohemia in the north. His successor Duke Frederick the Warlike used it as a military base for his Bohemian campaigns, until he was finally killed in battle in 1246. The erection of the St Vitus parish church was begun about 1240, it is today one of the largest preserved Romanesque church buildings in Lower Austria.\n\nLaa's town privileges were confirmed when the Austrian lands had passed to King Ottokar II of Bohemia, and again in 1281 by the Habsburg ruler King Rudolph I of Germany after his victory in the Battle on the Marchfeld. Nevertheless, the town's significance decreased over the following decades, it was devastated by the troops of Margrave Jobst of Moravia in 1407 and again in 1426 by Hussite forces. According to legend, the later Pope Pius II (Enea Silvio Piccolomini) worked as a priest at the Laa parish church from 1442, actually he served as papal legate to the Imperial Diet and counsellor of Emperor Frederick III. To improve Laa's economy, the citizens were granted the privilege of brewing in 1454.\n\nDuring the Thirty Years' War, the town was first occupied by Bohemian troops until the 1620 Battle of White Mountain, later by Swedish forces, who left Laa in a desolate condition. It remained a sedate county town when Napoleon marched through in 1809 during the War of the Fifth Coalition. However, Laa's development was promoted by the opening of a railway connection to Austria's capital Vienna in 1869, with a branch line of the Eastern Railway which led on to Hevlín and Brno (Brünn) in Moravia. Another branch via Pulkau to Zellerndorf which connected to the Vienna-Znojmo railway line opened in 1873.\n\nLaa again became a border town after World War I with the establishment of the First Czechoslovak Republic; at the end of World War II it bordered the \"Iron Curtain\" dividing Europe. In June 2005, about 250 townspeople and 80 visitors from the US, Israel and Europe with historical family links to former Jewish citizens of Laa an der Thaya assembled with Mayor Fass to dedicate a memorial to the members of 33 Jewish families of Laa murdered by the SS in Auschwitz.

The airport's basic infrastructure was complete by the end of 1990, which allowed the Allied forces engaged in the first Gulf War in early 1991 to use the field for the storage of military aircraft. KFIA was the base used by all USAF A-10s (144), as well as the US Army's 101st Airborne's AH-64, CH-47, UH-60, and OH-58 helicopters during the Gulf War. It was much more than a storage area. The US Army had many units there before the start of the war, as well as during redeployment from Iraq after. The General Authority of Civil Aviation of Saudi Arabia finally opened the new Dammam King Fahd International Airport on 28 November 1999 to commercial traffic, and all airlines transferred their operations from Dhahran International Airport, which had been in use until then. The new Dammam airport serves most of Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia and in particular the growing urban complex made up of Dammam, Dhahran, Khobar, Qatif, Ras Tanura, while its catchment area also covers Jubail with total population of about 2.5 million served. The airport is the third major hub for Saudia, and furthermore was a hub for the now defunct Sama Airlines.\n\nThe airport is named for Fahd bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, King of Saudi Arabia from 1982 until his death in 2005.\n\nDesign started in 1976. The site master plan was created by architecture firm Yamasaki & Associates and Boeing Aerosystems International, and completed in 1977. Construction began in 1983, and the airport opened for commercial operations on 28 November 1999.\n\nThe airport, in the Eastern Province of the country, is located between Qatif and Dammam, about away from Dammam. The location of this airport provides unique role as it hosts the Kingdom's shortest international flight to Bahrain as well as operating Saudi Arabia's longest domestic flight between Dammam and Tabuk. The airport is linked to populated areas by two major roads. The northern exit, which used to be the only one, links the airport with Qatif as a four-lane highway. The southern exit links the airport with Dammam as a six-lane highway to King Fahd Road which is now considered as the main road to the airport. Abu Hadriyah Highway () serves as the airport's eastern border while the Dammam-Riyadh Highway serves as a southern border. On the airport's southern border, Saudi Aramco occupies an area of , which is used for oil drilling and transportation facilities.\n\nThe terminal has six stories, three of which are allocated for passenger processing. The third level is for arrivals, the sixth level is for departures, and the fourth level is for boarding. There are two partial levels: the mezzanine service level and the mezzanine level (which is the uppermost level).\n\nThe passenger terminal's total area is . Approximately were built in the first phase, in addition to 11 fixed passenger boarding bridges serving 15 gates out of an original design capacity of 31 fixed boarding bridges. At the present time only 7 out of 11 boarding bridges can be used for international flight arrivals as the southern section of the terminal that hosts the remaining four gates is still unused making those gates unconnected to passport control and customs, however since domestic flights are entirely running from the operating northern section, all eleven boarding bridges can be used for domestic flights as well as the departures of international flights.\n\nThe terminal is equipped with several customer counters of which 66 were allocated to Saudia (now shared with flynas and SaudiGulf Airlines), 44 to foreign airlines, and the rest for customs and immigration.\n\nSeveral sources, such as the Guinness Book of World Records mention this airport as the largest in the world, with a total area of 780 square kilometers (larger than Bahrain). The official website, however, publishes an actual utilized airport area of , or 36.75 square kilometers. It does mention a total area of , but that includes the whole property.\n\nPassenger Facilities\n\nKing Fahd International Airport was the first among Saudi Arabia's international airports to adopt duty-free stores. In addition to the spaces allocated to duty-free stores, the airport has a separate area for shops specializing in the sale of gifts and all passenger related goods. This area includes restaurants, cafeterias, and banks, and is located on the arrivals level. The distinction is largely meaningless however as the Kingdom has no sales or import duties on any products. Recently, as part of larger marketing project named \"Golden Circle\", several shops and services are planned to open including indoor playgrounds and travel agencies.\n\nThe airport Mosque is built on the roof of the car park and in the middle of a landscaped area of 46,200 m² (497,292 ft²). It has an architectural design that combines modern style with the old Islamic style (arches, domes, and other Islamic decorations and carvings on the doors, Mihrab, and Mimbar). The Mosque accommodates two thousand worshipers, access to it can be easily gained from the passenger terminal through two enclosed, air-conditioned bridges equipped with moving belts, in addition to a third open bridge.\n\nA 250-room Hilton hotel is currently under construction and is expected to open late 2018 or early 2019. The hotel will be linked to the airport terminal by a pedestrian bridge to facilitate easy access to and from the hotel.\n\nThe Royal Terminal is reserved for the Saudi Royal Family, government personnel, and official guests. The terminal was built on an area of and has four bridges linking the terminal and aircraft. It is luxuriously furnished and decorated, and includes extensively landscaped exteriors and grounds. Despite its specialized purpose, the terminal is rarely used by the Royal Family, who generally prefers to utilize a similar special terminal at King Abdulaziz Air Base.\n\nThe airport has two parallel runways with a length of each, in addition to taxiways parallel to the runways and a cross taxiway to connect the two runways. A distance of separates the two runways to facilitate simultaneous takeoff and landing operations. For more convenience and shorter taxiing durations, the east runway is usually used by Saudi Aramco while commercial airlines use the west one; however situation changes if one of the runways is undergoing maintenance. Space has been set aside for the construction of a third parallel runway.\n\nThe airport is classified as Code E by ICAO which makes it designed to accommodate large aircraft such as Boeing 747-400 and A340-600. Although it may practically be possible for A380 to use the airport it is not recommended as in order to accommodate such aircraft as Airbus A380 or Boeing 747-8 it requires the airport to be Code F. Only the runways at Dammam Airport meet Code F requirements; the taxiways and gates do not. In May 2009, an Antonov 225 the world's largest aircraft landed at Dammam Airport from Ukraine whilst transporting equipment used for oil drilling and exploration to Tanzania for Schlumberger.\n\nA road for ground support equipment (GSE) runs along the western side of the central terminal. It is designed to allow GSE to have access to aircraft and also to facilitate the movement of baggage vehicles from aircraft to baggage areas.\n\nThe two-story air cargo building is constructed on an area of and has a capacity of of incoming and outgoing cargo. The terminal's design allows for transforming the operation system to a fully automatic system equipped with multi-level racks and a container stacking system. When the air cargo facility becomes fully automatic, its capacity will be increased to per year.\n\nCargo village\n\nTo enhance its air cargo services, KFIA commenced construction of the new multi-model cargo village facility on 2012 which lasted for two years. The village was inaugurated on 6 April 2015. The cargo village is over . The village offers ease of shipping and cargo services and serves as a hub for global companies, directly serving the eastern province and the rest of the kingdom. The village offers direct access to Saudi Arabia and eliminates the need to ship through neighboring countries.\n\nCurrently, DHL Express, NAQEL, SMSA Express, TNT Express, and UPS are operating as anchor tenants. Additional capacity is coming on-line and will assist the airlines and companies operating in and out of the kingdom.\n\nThe control tower stands high, equivalent to the height of a 30-story building. The height allows visibility of all parts of the airport operations area. Its total floor area is , and it contains the following three main sections:\n\nThe total area of the car park is , distributed among three covered floors. The parking area accommodates 4,930 cars. Two open parking areas are available beside the rental car parking area to accommodate additional cars. There are no ceiling rates.\n\nThe general aviation terminal on the east side of Dammam airport is being used exclusively by Saudi Aramco. In addition, an advanced fleet of fuel tankers provides fuel services to all types of commercial aircraft. Saudi Aramco is responsible for supplying fuel and maintaining fuel installations. These include six large tanks with a capacity of 40,000 barrels each, in addition to pumping equipment, filters, loading stations, and the distribution valve network. Saudi Aramco operates regular flights for its personnel, which originate from Dammam to cover Haradh, Tanajib, Shaybah, Hawtah, Al Ahsa, Khurais, Riyadh, Jeddah, and Yanbu, in addition to some remote pump stations, using Boeing 737 and Embraer ERJ-170LR equipment.\n\nKing Fahd International Airport has its own plant nursery with a total area of which encompasses three green houses and of green fields. The nursery supplies the airport gardens and planted areas with trees and plants.\n\nAt present, around 9.7 million passengers use King Fahd International Airport annually\n\nRoad\n\nThe airport is connected by King Fahd Road, which is considered as the main road to the airport and the longest road in the Dammam metropolitan area.\n\nBus\n\nSAPTCO offers bus service from the airport to their main stations in Dammam, Khobar, and Jubail.\n\nTaxi\n\nThe airport is served by local taxi companies and London Taxi, which provides 24-hour service and is located at the arrivals terminal. Chauffeur service is available; Uber and Careem are also available.\n\nRail\n\nIn August 2016, the airport authority announced that it will connect the airport to the Dammam–Jubail railway, which is currently in its last stages of construction.\n\n\n"}

This resulted in the 1962 Cotswold Declaration which was signed by neo-Nazis from the United States, United Kingdom, France (Savitri Devi), West Germany (Bruno Ludtke), Austria and Belgium. More member nations would join later throughout the decade including Argentina, Australia, Chile, Ireland, South Africa, and Japan.\n\nFollowing Rockwell's assassination in 1967, control of the WUNS passed to Matt Koehl, who attempted to extend the influence of the group by appointing Danish neo-Nazi Povl Riis-Knudsen as general secretary. However a split began to develop over the insistence of Koehl that Nazism should also serve as a religion, and eventually he broke away from the WUNS to lead his own version of Nazi mysticism. The split fundamentally weakened the WUNS and its influence declined strongly, despite attempts by Jordan to reinvigorate it. Jordan remained the nominal leader of the organization until his death in 2009, when he was succeeded by Koehl, who was the titular leader until his own death in 2014.\n\nA number of groups have become members of the WUNS or accepted association to the group down the years.\n\nGiven the leadership of Rockwell and Koehl, the American Nazi Party and its successor the National Socialist White People's Party were the main constituent groups of the WUNS.\n\nIn Canada the group was represented by the Canadian Nazi Party, whose leader William John Beattie was chief of the WUNS in the country.\n\nIt was also active in South America through the \"Partido Nacionalsocialista Chileno\", a group set up in Chile by former 1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler Standartenführer Franz Pfeiffer. \n\nThe National Socialist Movement and its successor British Movement were members.\n\nWUNS was represented in Denmark by the National Socialist Workers' Party of Denmark, a rump group of the old pre-war movement affiliated under Sven Salicath, a close follower of Rockwell, and by its replacement, the National Socialist Movement of Denmark.\n\nThe Nordic Reich Party of Sweden maintained independence but co-operated closely with WUNS.\n\nBernhard Haarde formed a WUNS group in Iceland, claiming around 300 supporters.

{"id": "2212484", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2212484", "title": "Eastern lowland gorilla", "text": "Eastern lowland gorilla\n\nThe eastern lowland gorilla (\"Gorilla beringei graueri\") or Grauer's gorilla, is a subspecies of eastern gorilla endemic to the mountainous forests of eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Important populations of this gorilla live in the Kahuzi-Biega and Maiko National Parks and their adjacent forests, the Tayna Gorilla Reserve, the Usala forest and on the Itombwe Massif.\n\nIt is the largest of the four gorilla subspecies. It has a jet black coat like the mountain gorilla (\"Gorilla beringei beringei\"), although the hair is shorter on the head and body. The male's coat, like that of other gorillas, greys as the animal matures, resulting in the designation \"silverback\".\n\nThere are far fewer eastern lowland gorillas compared to western lowland gorillas.\nAccording to a 2004 report there were only about 5,000 eastern lowland gorillas in the wild, down to fewer than 3,800 in 2016, compared to over 100,000 western lowland gorillas. Outside their native range, only one female eastern lowland gorilla lives in captivity, at the Antwerp Zoo in Belgium.\n\nEastern lowland gorillas are the largest subspecies of gorilla and the largest living primates. Males have an average weight of , females of . The maximum standing height for males is , while females reach . An older weight calculated based on eight wild adult males is 169 kg.\n\nGorillas spend long hours feeding on plant matter every day. Gorillas are stable apes as they stay together for months and years at a time, much like the structure of a family. Groups of eastern lowland gorillas are usually larger than those of western gorillas.\n\nThe eastern lowland gorilla has the widest altitudinal range of any of the gorilla subspecies, being found in mountainous, transitional and lowland tropical forests. One of the most studied eastern lowland gorilla population lives in the highlands of Kahuzi-Biega, where habitats vary between dense primary forests to moderately moist woodland, to Cyperus swamp and peat bog.\n\nGorillas do not eat banana fruits, but they may destroy banana trees to eat the nutritious pith. The eastern lowland gorilla shows a preference for regenerating vegetation associated with abandoned villages and fields. Farmers who have come in contact with gorillas in their plantations have killed the gorilla and obtained a double benefit, protecting their crop and using the meat of the gorilla to sell at the market.\n\nEastern lowland gorilla has a varied plants diet including fruits, leaves, stems and bark as well as small insects such as ants and termites. Although they occasionally eat ants, insects form only a minor part of their diet. In comparison to western lowland gorillas, found in low altitude tropical forests.\n\nEastern lowland gorillas are highly sociable and very peaceful, living in groups of two to over 30. A group usually consists of one silverback, several females and their offspring. Silverbacks are strong and each group has one dominant leader (see alpha male). These males protect their group from danger. Young silverback males will slowly begin to leave their natal group when they reach maturity, and will then attempt to attract females to form their own group.\n\nRelatively little is known about the social behaviour, history and ecology of eastern lowland gorillas, partly because of civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. However, some aspects of social behaviour have been studied. For example, gorillas form harems which may include two full-grown males. One third of gorilla groups in East Africa have two grown males in their group.\n\nMost primates are bonded together by the relationship between females, a pattern also seen in many human families. Once they reach maturity, both females and males usually leave the group. Females usually join another group or a lone silverback adult male, whereas males may stay together temporarily, until they attract females and establish their own groups. It is commonly believed that the structure of the gorilla group is to prevent predation.\n\nA female will give birth to a single infant after a gestation period of about 8½ months. They breastfeed for about three years. The baby can crawl at around nine weeks old and can walk at about 35 weeks old. Infant gorillas normally stay with their mother for three to four years and mature at around 8 years old (females) and 12 years old (males).\n\nThreats to the eastern lowland gorilla's survival include poaching, civil unrest, and the destruction of gorilla habitat through logging, mining, and agriculture.\n\nThe primary cause of the decline in eastern lowland gorilla populations is poaching for meat, known as bushmeat. It is eaten by displaced peoples residing in the region affected by the civil war, militias groups and loggers and miners. Surveys have shown that great apes, chimpanzees and bonobos comprise 0.5-2% of the meat found in bushmeats markets. Some researchers have found that up to 5 million metric tons of bushmeat are traded annually. This has a detrimental effect on the eastern lowland gorilla populations because of their slow rate of reproduction and their already struggling population. Although gorilla bushmeat only constitutes a small proportion of the bushmeat sold, it continues to encourage a decline in the gorilla populations being subjected to hunting. Endangered Species International stated that 300 gorillas are killed each year to supply the bushmeat markets in the Congo.\n\nConservation groups negotiated with rebels who control the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo to re-arm the park guards. After the war began, government funding of the park was stopped. Conservation groups WWF, International Gorilla Conservation Program and Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit (German development agency) have funded the guards for the past several years.\n\nCivil unrest in the Democratic Republic of Congo has resulted in a decline in eastern lowland gorillas. The region inhabited by eastern gorillas has decreased from 8,100 square miles to 4,600 square miles in the past 50 years. This primate species now occupies only 13% of its historical area. Violence in the region has made research difficult, however, scientists have estimated that the population has decreased by more than 50% since the mid-1990s. In the mid-1990s, the population was recorded to be nearly 17,000 gorillas.\n\nThe civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo means military groups remain in the forest for long periods of time. Thus, poaching has increased as militia and refugees become hungry. Military leaders have also disarmed the park security guards in national parks meaning they have virtually no control over the activities that occur within the park, and those that enter it, when faced with armed soldiers. The militia groups present in the region restrict protection of the eastern lowland gorilla. It has been estimated that more than half of the 240 gorillas known in one study have been killed as a result of poaching. Researchers have also stated that it is more difficult to patrol areas outside of the park and expect to find even higher levels of poaching.\n\nConservation groups negotiated with rebels who control the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo to re-arm the park guards After the war began, government funding of the park was stopped. Conservation groups, International Gorilla Conservation Program and Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit (German development agency) have funded the guards for the past several years.\n\nMany multinational corporations are indirectly, and some directly, funding the civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo by buying illegal resources from the area or by trading resources for military weaponry. Reports from 2007 state that 14,694 tons of cassiterite ($45 million USD), 1,193 tons of wolframite (worth $4.27 million USD) and 393 tons of coltan ($5.42 million USD) were exported in 2007. Coltan in particular is one of the main export resources bought by multinational corporations illegally and is growing in demand due to its use for cellphones. Traxy’s alone bought 226 tonnes of coltan in 2007 which is 57% of the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s entire coltan. The United Nations Environmental Programme reported that resources from multinational corporations and pension funds in industrialized countries are \"directed through subsidiary companies to help finance corruption and arms sales, processes that may involve 'conflict' natural resources\" Private companies have been found to trade weapons for resources or provide access to weapons through subsidiary companies.\n\nApproximately two million people, directly and indirectly related to the Rwandan genocide in 1994, fled to Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, mainly in Virunga National Park. It has been estimated that there were 720,000 refugees living in five camps in the DRC bordering the park (Katale, Kahindo, Kibumba, Mugunga and Lac Vert), 24. Deforestation occurred as 80,000 refugees travelled into the park daily to find wood. Deforestation occurred at a rate of 0.1 km2 per day. Once the Congo war began in 1996, 500,000 refugees remained, putting pressure on the natural resources, including the eastern lowland gorilla.\n\nIllegal logging may occur from companies with no rights to the land or by legal landholders. Over-harvesting is an illegal practice often conducted by legal concession holder and encourages deforestation and illegal resources exportation. The areas logged are prime gorilla habitat and is considered an international concern. Companies involved in illegal exploitation therefore encourage environmental destruction in the area and fuel the illegal export industry controlled by militia groups.\n\nMost parks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are insecure areas restricting the access of park rangers. Although park rangers are trained to stop illegal hunting, the small number of park rangers do not have access to further training or equipment to handle the militia groups. In the Virunga National Park, for example, 190 park rangers have been killed in just the past 15 years from civil war. Laws in place enforce trans-boundary collaboration and have been proven successful in reducing the decline of the eastern lowland gorilla Illegal extraction of resources from the Virunga National Park has been reduced by policing transportation across borders. This has reduced the financial input available to the militias in the region. Although park rangers have been successful in restricting the amount of illegal resources being transported out of the region, militias groups have retaliated by purposely killing a group of gorillas to threaten the park rangers. On July 22, 2007, 10 gorillas were killed in retaliation for the park rangers' interference with the exportation of illegal resources such as wood.\n\nThe militia have remained in control in the region as a result of the neighbouring countries. These militia groups trade minerals and timber illegally in exchange for arms from neighbouring countries, corrupt officials and subsidiaries of many multinational companies. Gorillas are also threatened directly by militia groups because of the prevalence of booby traps placed randomly throughout the forest. Although the eastern lowland gorilla population is directly affected by the violence of militia groups, their population is mainly endangered by habitat disruption from the extraction of natural resources.\n\nThere was already evidence of inbreeding depression in some gorilla populations, evident through birth defects like syndactyly. A recent genome studies which included all four subspecies gorilla, aimed to identifying the levels of diversity and divergence among the remaining populations of gorilla. Results showed that this the eastern lowland gorilla subspecies was in fact two distinct subgroups. This division could have been due to the small number of individuals sampled, or due to the social structures within the subspecies. Results suggest that within the eastern lowland gorilla subspecies there is an extreme lack of variation, which could reduce the potential of the subspecies to undergo natural selection and adapt to their environment. This lack of diversity is thought to be due to limited number of founders and low levels of migration, which has resulted in a high level of inbreeding in these small population. Conservation interventions for the eastern lowland gorilla have suggested implementing captive breeding programs or translocations between the eastern lowland subgroups.\n\n"}

The client in that case is typically software intending to call a single method of a remote system. Multiple input parameters can be passed to the remote method as an array or object, whereas the method itself can return multiple output data as well. (This depends on the implemented version.)\n\nAll transfer types are single objects, serialized using JSON. A request is a call to a specific method provided by a remote system. It must contain three certain properties:\n\nThe receiver of the request must reply with a valid response to all received requests. A response must contain the properties mentioned below.\n\nSince there are situations where no response is needed or even desired, notifications were introduced. A notification is similar to a request except for the id, which is not needed because no response will be returned. In this case the codice_3 property should be omitted (Version 2.0) or be codice_8 (Version 1.0).\n\nIn these examples, codice_9 denotes data sent to a service (\"request\"), while codice_10 denotes data coming from a service. Although codice_10 is often called a \"response\" in client–server computing, depending on the JSON-RPC version it does not necessarily imply an \"answer\" to a request\".\"\n\nRequest and response:\n\nNotification (no response):\n\nRequest and response:\n\nRequest and response:\n\n\n\n[[Category:JSON]]\n[[Category:Web services]]\n[[Category:Remote procedure call]]"}

He is perhaps best known as the long-term companion of Ivor Novello.\n\nAndrews was born in Camden Town, the son of Walter Andrews (1861–1935), a horse bus inspector, and his wife Ada Harriet, née Judd (1864–1946). He was the younger brother of actress Maidie Andrews.\n\nAndrews began his stage acting career at age eleven. He made his first stage appearance in the play \"Shore Acres\" in 1906. His child actor contemporaries included Noël Coward and Philip Tonge. Coward referred to Andrews as Tonge's \"only serious rival\" among the \"boy actors\" of the London theater.\n\nIn 1907, at the age of twelve, Andrews appeared in Horace Annesley's comedy \"Her Son\" as \"Min, the eight-year-old child of Crystal and Gasgoyne,\" a role for which he received significant acclaim. Andrews' \"finished and sympathetic performance\" was described as \"the success of [\"Her Son\"'s] \"première,\"\" \"a genuine and surprising triumph\" that caused \"quite a sensation.\" In 1911, he briefly worked in Chicago, acting in the play \"The Backsliders\", before returning to London theatre.\n\nHis stage career continued into adulthood with performances as Marcel in the 1920 production of \"The Children's Carnival\", Maurice Avery in the 1920 production of \"Columbine\", and Tyltyl in the 1921 production of \"The Betrothal\". In 1921, he appeared as Charles Deburau in the play \"Deburau\"; \"Deburau\" also featured Andrews's lover Ivor Novello's debut performance. Andrews starred in a number of Novello's theater productions, beginning with the play \"Fresh Fields\" in 1932. Amongst his many character parts was the Prime Minister in Ivor Novello's musical play \"King's Rhapsody\" at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.\n\nWhile he was primarily a stage actor, Andrews also made several film appearances. In 1923, he acted in the silent film \"Fires of Innocence\" as Pen Arkwright. His co-star Joan Morgan later claimed that she did not remember anything about her time working on the film, except for Andrews. She described how, during a \"love-scene,\" Andrews would not look at her because he claimed he didn't \"feel a bit in the mood to see [her].\"\n\nAndrews first met Ivor Novello in 1916, while Novello was attending the opera with his friend Edward Marsh. They eventually became lovers. He was also responsible for introducing Novello to Noël Coward in 1916, at Coward's request. Andrews and Novello both had relations with other men over the course of their long-term relationship, but Andrews remained Novello's primary companion until Novello's death in 1951.\n\nAndrews died at his family home, 37 St Mary's Mansions, Kensington.\n"}
{"id": "2212490", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2212490", "title": "Steve Lombardi", "text": "Steve Lombardi\n\nSteven Kenneth Lombardi (born April 18, 1961) is an American semi-retired professional wrestler and road agent, better known by his ring name, The Brooklyn Brawler. He worked for the professional wrestling promotion, WWE, as well as several independent promotions.\n\nThough some sources erroneously give Lombardi's birthplace as Detroit, Michigan, he was born at Brooklyn's Victory Memorial Hospital to Renaldo and Rosemarie Lombardi and he grew up in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn, New York. His father worked as an airline mechanic. Lombardi studied biochemistry at St. Francis College prior to his wrestling career.\n\nLombardi began his WWF career in late 1983, competing under his real name, and being a heel, primarily as an enhancement talent. His debut came on July 15, 1983 in Queens, NY where he was defeated by Swede Hanson. After facing Ivan Koloff and Sgt. Slaughter on house show matches, Lombardi made his TV debut on the October 29th episode of All American Wrestling where he was submitted by The Iron Sheik and carried out on a stretcher. He then began regular appearances on both television and house shows.\n\nAfter losing numerous matches that winter, Lombardi gained his first success on March 18, 1984 when he wrestled Jerry Valiant to a draw. Another draw, this time with Terry Daniels came on April 24 in Mountaintop, PA. But apart from that he continued on as an enhancement talent, losing to much of the WWF roster including Big John Studd, Paul Orndorff, David Schultz, Iron Mike Sharpe, Rocky Johnson, and others. In the midst of another long losing streak, Lombardi then gained a second draw against Daniels on June 1 in Winston-Salem, NC. He made his Madison Square Garden debut on June 16, losing to Mad Dog Vachon in the latter's first match back in the WWF in a decade. A month later on July 6 in Long Island, NY Lombardi gained his first pinfall victory when he upset Vachon in a return match. On July 31 he became involved in a mild angle with WWF World Champion Hulk Hogan during the company's initial \"Championship Wrestling\" taping in Poughkeepsie, NY. During a sub-minute loss to Kamala, Hogan came out to the ring to give encouragement to Lombardi. Nothing further came from this angle, and Lombardi closed out his second year as a wrestler with numerous additional losses to wrestlers such as a Buddy Rose and young Bret Hart, as well as a defeat to manager Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan.\n\nAs the company continued to expand Lombardi remained a young enhancement talent, although this time he was switched to face other similar talent in house shows across the country. He consistently put over various young wrestlers such as Paul Roma, David Sammartino, Barry O, Terry Gibbs, and George Wells. On the June 29th episode of \"All-American Wrestling\" Lombardi teamed with Dave Barbie in a losing effort to The Killer Bees in their debut match. Lombardi would go on to face numerous wrestlers in their debuts during his long career. Almost eleven months after his first ever victory, Lombardi gained another when he pinned Jack Armstrong on June 22 in Boston, MA. After numerous losses, a month later Lombardi garnered the first win streak of his career when he defeated Dan Rignati and George Sanders on successive house shows. On November 14 defeated Dennis Goulet, and then on December 5 in Long Island, NY pinned Paul Roma, this finishing with five wins for 1985.\n\nLombardi remained a consistent presence on television and house shows, wrestling over 150 times. The company continued to pair the young but now experienced Lombardi against other new wrestlers, and he would face newcomers such as Sivi Afi, Tony Parisi, Nick Kiniski, Dan Spivey, and Scott McGee. He gained his first ever tag-team win when he teamed with fellow enhancement talent Lanny Poffo to defeat SD Jones and George Skaaland on April 13 in Brisbane, Australia. After dozens of defeats he gained his first pinfall victory of 1986 in singles action when he defeated Terry Gibbs in Pittsburgh, PA on August 9. On the November 15th episode of WWF Superstars he participated in another debut, teaming with Moondog Spot in a loss to the newly arrived Can-Am Connection. Lombardi closed out 1986 with wins over Barry O, Jim Powers, Mark Young, Frankie Lane, and an upset of Tony Garea.\n\nDespite a tick upwards in in-ring success, Lombardi began 1987 seemingly cemented as an entry-level wrestler without an angle. But that was not to last long, as he began to establish an on-screen presence as a heel. On the January 24th episode of WWF Superstars Paul Orndorff defeated Paul Roma; following the match Lombardi entered and tossed Roma from the ring. This led to a house show series between Roma and Lombardi, and for both wrestlers it was their first real feud. Despite coming out winless, Lombardi was now more than just a non-descript jobber. He upset Sivi Afi on March 1 in Landover, MD, then gained another surprise victory over Tony Garea a month later. On June 17 Lombardi participated in yet another debut, this time facing The Dingo Warrior (Ultimate Warrior) in Wichita Falls, TX.\n\nA month later he began what would be an on-again, off-again team with Barry Horowitz, losing to The Young Stallions on the July 26th episode of Wrestling Challenge. Four weeks later, on August 21 in Detroit, MI the team would defeat Sivi Afi and Scott Casey. After gaining a pair of pinfall singles wins over the newly arrived Sam Houston, Lombardi then switched alliances to join Mike Sharpe. The two proclaimed themselves as \"the tag-team of the future\" in an inset during a match with The Young Stallions in August, but were unsuccessful.\n\nEntering the fall Lombardi continued to lose regularly but was now gaining a smattering of wins (Sivi Afi, David Sammartino, Jerry Allen, Tony Garea, and Outback Jack). Still an enhancement talent, he was now beginning to climb the ladder.\n\nLombardi began 1988 with several squash losses, and then a win over Scott Casey on January 23 in Lexington, KY. Two days later at Madison Square Garden he resumed his partnership with Barry Horowitz and faced The Young Stallions in a losing effort. The following day in Hershey, PA Lombardi and Horowitz gained their first victory as a team when they defeated Scott Casey and Lanny Poffo in a match that aired on Prime Time Wrestling. The same night they would fall to The Killer Bees. The pairing would continue into the summer.\n\nLater that winter Lombardi began a house show series with Brady Boone, and for the first time in his career enjoyed a consistent string of success. While still losing to top level stars on television, he was now consistently trading wins with other entry-level talent that he previously had succumbed to. On the March 21st episode of Prime Time Wrestling he defeated SD Jones, and began trading wins with Brady Boone. However beginning in July his small push seemed to dissipate as he found himself consistently on the losing end to Paul Roma and the new arrival, the Blue Blazer (Owen Hart). In December matters took a turn as Lombardi enjoyed the first sustained win streak of his career, defeating Jim Powers and Jose Estrada on multiple occasions and closing out 1988 on a seven match win streak. It was a sign of the first major angle that Lombardi would participate in.\n\nAfter a breakup between The Red Rooster and Bobby Heenan, the latter invited Rooster onto the set of Prime Time Wrestling on January 23 to make the peace. When Rooster was about to shake Heenan's hand he was suddenly attacked by Lombardi, who hit Rooster and host Gorilla Monsoon with a stool. The next week Lombardi made his debut as \"The Brooklyn Brawler\" The Brawler character was that of a street fighter, wearing battered jeans and a torn New York Yankees T-shirt, which was ironic, since the Yankees play in The Bronx and were hated by many Brooklynites when the Dodgers played in the borough until moving to Los Angeles in 1958. \n\nUnder the tutelage of Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan, the Brawler entered a feud with the Red Rooster. When the Red Rooster left Heenan's villain group and became a fan favorite, Heenan stated that he had made the Red Rooster a star and could do the same with anyone in the WWF. The Red Rooster defeated the Brooklyn Brawler on \"Saturday Night's Main Event XX\", and then Heenan at WrestleMania V. The Brawler was defeated by the Rooster again on the May 20, 1989 episode of \"Superstars of Wrestling\". His alliance with Heenan was then phased out, though in storyline Heenan said it was an amicable departure, and Heenan would continue to speak highly of the Brawler whenever a match featured him. Lombardi soon returned to his former enhancement talent status and won only five more matches (Tom Stone, Jerry Monti, Paul Roma, and Al Perez) for the rest of 1989. However, he retained the Brawler gimmick, a role he would utilize throughout his career.\n\nNow firmly re-established as an enhancement talent sans Heenan, 1990 marked a first for Lombardi when he wrestled his debut match at a PPV. At the 1990 Royal Rumble he was defeated by Paul Roma in a dark match, which marked the first of several PPVs where he would work the opening dark match to warm up the crowd. After sustaining numerous defeats to upper level talent such as Intercontinental Champion The Ultimate Warrior, Lombardi finally gained a measure of revenge by pinning The Red Rooster on March 18 in Calgary, Alberta. He would enter a winning streak against the Rooster, who would soon depart from the WWF.\n\nLombardi wrestled the dark match of WrestleMania VI, losing again to Paul Roma. After another long string of defeats to Roma, Hillbilly Jim, Tugboat and others, Lombardi earned a smattering of victories in May against Martin Roy, Jim Brunzell, and Brady Boone. During the summer he engaged in a house show series against the newly arrived Shane Douglas but was turned away in each encounter. The two would wrestle in the dark match of SummerSlam 90. On October 9 Lombardi faced Davey Boy Smith in his first match back after nearly a two-year absence, and in December he went on his first overseas tour when the WWF joined forces with Super World Sports to promote in Japan. On December 6 in Hijemi, Japan he teamed with Nuboyashi Sugawara and Kenny the Striker to defeat Biff Wellington, Road Block, and Masao Orihara. Despite his return to enhancement status, 1990 proved to be Lombardi's most successful year in his career to date as he won 35 singles matches.\n\nLombardi entered 1991 as probably the most prominent opening card act in the company, but the wins were not to continue. Wrestling still as the Brooklyn Brawler, he fell in defeat to almost every member of the roster and gained just six victories during the year. On the March 30th episode of WWF Superstars Lombardi faced Ricky Steamboat in \"The Dragon\"'s return match after a three-year absence. On March 24 he competed in the dark match of WrestleMania VII against Koko B Ware.\nOther notable losses saw Brawler lose to a young Scott Putski on a May 28 WWF Superstars dark match, as well as Vick Steamboat (wrestling as \"Jesse Bolt\") in another dark match at the July 29th WWF Superstars taping.\n\nIn August Lombardi traveled to Japan again as part of another joint WWF/SWS tour and teamed with Rick Martel. The following month saw Lombardi engage in his first feud since 1989, when he became part of a short angle with newcomer Big Bully Busick to determine who was the true bully of the WWF. On the October 28th edition of Prime Time Wrestling the Brawler defeated Busick by countout in what turned out to be the blowoff for the feud. Brawler defeated the Bully by countout and in a rematch one week later saw the Brawler dominate the Bully until the latter's manager Harvey Wippleman grabbed the Brawler's leg, leading to a controversial win for the Bully. The feud with Busick led to a quasi-face turn for Lombardi as he was then matched up against various heel opponents for the remainder of 1991.\n\nLombardi opened 1992 anchoring the dark match of yet another PPV, this time the 1992 Royal Rumble. He initially defeated Chris Walker with his feet on the ropes; afterwards WWF President Jack Tunney came out and reversed the decision. Lombardi returned to heel status with his Brawler gimmick, matching up against numerous faces during the winter and spring such as Kerry Von Erich, Tatanka, and Big Bossman. Lombardi renewed his partnership with a returning Barry Horowitz on March 9 at a WWF Superstars taping, facing and losing to The Samoan Swat Team in the latters' tryout match. They would team again in December against The Bushwhackers. He spent much of the spring and summer engaged in a house show series of with Jim Powers, Jim Brunzell, Crush, and Tito Santana during which he was winless. He closed out 1992 on a lengthy losing streak to Jim Duggan.\n\nGoing into 1993 Lombardi was back where he had been prior to the Brawler gimmick – stuck as enhancement talent with no clear path upwards. And it was finally during this year, a decade into his tenure with the company that he went on his longest winning streak to date. Matched again versus Jim Powers in numerous house show matches, Lombardi put together an eight match winning streak in March and April. Later in the spring Lombardi defeated a young Scott Taylor in a tryout match in Sydney, Nova Scotia at a Wrestling Challenge taping. In the summer the Brawler was matched up against another young wrestler – The Predator (Mike Bollea), with Lombardi winning each match. He closed out the summer teaming with Blake Beverly and Little Louie against The Bushwhackers and Tiger Jackson, as well as defeating a young Tommy Dreamer at a WWF Superstars taping on August 17.\n\nTwo weeks later, on August 31, Lombardi finally received a new gimmick – that of a baseball player seemingly modeled after The Furies from the movie \"The Warriors\". At a WWF Superstars taping in Grand Rapids, MI he debuted with the new persona and defeated Reno Riggins, then did the same the following day at a Wrestling Challenge event. A month later, as \"MVP\", he made his first appearance on Monday Night Raw and participated in the 20-man battle royal to determine the champion for the vacated Intercontinental title. MVP was eliminated by Owen Hart. The following day at WWF Superstars he defeated Duane Gill, but at this point the WWF decided to shelf the gimmick and he was reassigned to temporarily play the role of Doink the Clown that had been vacated by Matt Borne.\n\nWrestling as Doink, he was winless against Bret Hart, 1-2-3 Kid, and Bam-Bam Bigelow. Still in the clown gimmick, Lombardi made his first appearance in the United States Wrestling Association on October 26 in Louisville, KY. Teaming with Brian Christopher, the two defeated Jeff Jarrett and Tony Falk. He would continue to play Doink until Ray Apollo assumed the gimmick. Following the 1993 Survivor Series, Lombardi wrestled under his fourth gimmick of the year. Unofficially restarting his partnership with Barry Horowitz, the duo competed as The Red and Black Knights (the Knights having been a Survivor Series team under Shawn Michaels, previously portrayed by Jeff Gaylord, Greg Valentine, and Horowitz). The Knights participated in several house show matches against The Smoking Gunns. A fifth gimmick was also used at points, as Lombardi portrayed Kim Chee (Kamala's handler) during his 1986–87 and 1992 stints with the WWF and briefly in 1993 as a singles wrestler after Kamala left him for the newly ordained Reverend Slick.\n\nIn November 1993, Lombardi also returned to his Brooklyn Brawler gimmick, but was winless in encounters with Diesel, Tatanka, and Bob Backlund. He made his first PPV appearance of the year, wrestling in the dark match at the Survivor Series and losing to Billy Gunn. Still, he ended 1993 having enjoyed more success than at any point in the decade, having garnered 23 wins. Over a decade into his tenure with the company, Lombardi now found himself as the long-tenured active wrestler within the WWF. Having returned to the Brawler gimmick however he remained in his enhancement talent role. He again participated in another wrestler's debut, this time facing Bob Holly on the January 29th episode of WWF Superstars (Fayetteville, NC). Lombardi earned yet another dark match at a PPV, this time at the 1994 Royal Rumble. However unlike previous appearances, he earned his first ever PPV victory by defeating long-time foe Jim Powers. This would be his only victory for many months as he entered another long losing streak, falling to Bob Holly and Bob Backlund on numerous house show events.\n\nThe impending baseball shutdown of 1994 provided a window of opportunity for him, and on the July 16th episode of Monday Night RAW the WWF began hyping the impending debut of a new wrestler called Abe \"Knuckleball\" Schwartz. In early August as the 1994 Major League Baseball strike began, Lombardi made his return as Schwartz. Basically a renamed version of the MVP gimmick, Lombardi's face was painted to look like a baseball and he wore a jersey with the number 00. In addition, he was accompanied to the ring by a carnival-like version of \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game.\" Later, the MVP name would be used by Montel Vontavious Porter. On the August 15th edition of RAW he made his debut as Abe Schwartz, blaming the fans for the baseball strike. Although barely recognizable in the gimmick, Lombardi's career was little changed by the new persona. He continued to lose matches to Bob Holly, as well as dropping numerous contests to a young PJ Walker. Finally in late September he enjoyed his first win streak, defeating Louie Spicolli and PJ Walker on numerous house show matches on the West Coast. However the WWF would pull the plug on the gimmick again, and Lombardi returned once more to the Brooklyn Brawler persona.\n\nLombardi made his first PPV appearance of 1995 in the dark match of the Royal Rumble, facing Buck Quartermain. Wrestling now full-time as The Brooklyn Brawler, his career was seemingly devoid of momentum as he dropped matches to Lex Luger, Duke Droese, Man Mountain Rock, and Doink (Ray Apollo). For the first time in over a year, he resumed his partnership with Horowitz yet again and faced off against Tekno Team 2000 in their Monday Night Raw debut on May 16. They would also lose to The Bushwhackers and The Smoking Guns.\n\nWith the WWF cutting back touring that year, Lombardi's appearances became less frequent. He was now the last of the troupe of enhancement talent.\n\nAs the Brawler, he made a non-wrestling appearance on the January 1st episode of RAW to present the \"Steve Lombardi Trophy\" to the winners of the RAW Bowl. His appearances from this point forward became much more limited. However, on March 10 at a WWF Superstars taping in Corpus Christi he participated in the debut of perhaps the most famous of the wrestlers that he had helped usher into the company – Dwayne Johnson. This came over a decade after a young Lombardi had faced his father Rocky Johnson. Johnson later recalled the match in his autobiography; praising Lombardi as a stand-up wrestler. He wrestled only thirteen times that year, ending with matches against Sid and Bob Holly.\n\nAlthough his appearances were now occasional, Lombardi enjoyed his biggest moment thirteen years into his WWF career. On the September 22nd show at Madison Square Garden he unexpectedly won a 20-man battle royal to earn his first ever WWF World Title opportunity. On the following show on November 15, Lombardi received his shot. Coming out to Frank Sinatra's \"New York, New York\", he wrestled for 15 minutes against Shawn Michaels and dominated the world champion; however he finally lost after Chyna and HHH interfered. On December 15, he faced Mark Henry in a singles match, but lost by Submission.\n\nLombardi retired from full-time active competition and instead worked primarily as a road agent for the WWF. He still would make occasional appearances in ring, and the first came on January 12, 1998 when he lost a Monday Night RAW dark match to Bart Gunn, who was then billed briefly as \"Black Bart\". Still working in as The Brooklyn Brawler, he wrestled only one more match in 1998.\n\nWith the Monday Night War in full-swing and business soaring for the company, Lombardi's activity picked up in 1999. He wrestled several times on a European tour in April 1999, facing Christian, X-Pac, and Al Snow.\nLombardi wrestled his first televised match in two years when he appeared on the July 3rd edition of Shotgun Saturday Night in a match against WWF Hardcore Championship Al Snow. The referee in the match was former heel manager Harvey Wippleman, who prevented Snow from using weapons while allowing Lombardi to use outside objects instead. Snow successfully retained his title. The following month during the WWF referee strike storyline, Lombardi worked as a ref during a Sunday Night Heat match. He concluded 1999 with a Jakked appearance, tagging with Mideon in a losing effort to TAKA Michinoku and Sho Funaki.\n\nOn the February 28th, 2000 edition of Monday Night RAW The Rock came out and said that he would become WWF World Champion at WrestleMania 2000. WWF World Champion HHH then came out and said that since The Rock was no longer the #1 Contender, he would have to start at the very bottom and work his way up. HHH then booked a match between The Rock and The Brooklyn Brawler, which Rock won in under a minute. On the July 4th edition of Smackdown Lombardi gained his first victory in several years when he joined TAKA Michinoku and Sho Funaki to face HHH in a 3 on 1 match. Lombardi pinned Helmsley after Chris Jericho interfered. Lombardi continued to be semi-active throughout 2000, wrestling in numerous house shows and facing Jerry Lawler for the first time at an event in New Haven, CT on August 9, 2000. He gained several more victories that year as well, defeating Joey Abs and Just Joe.\n\nThe surge of in-ring activity continued, as Lombardi began 2001 with a victory over The Goodfather on January 13, 2001 in Detroit, MI after Billy Gunn interfered. He wrestled several house show matches that winter, facing Al Snow, Crash Holly, and Rhyno. After appearing in numerous dark matches throughout his career, Lombardi finally wrestled during the live broadcast of a PPV when he once again appeared as Kamala’s handler Kim Chee at WrestleMania X-Seven and competed in the gimmick battle royal.\n\nAfter being inactive throughout the summer, Lombardi returned to the house show circuit to face Chuck Palumbo in October In November he was matched against MMA fighter Ron Waterman, who was working for the WWF at the time under a developmental deal. On November 26, Lombardi returned to television for the first time in over a year when he faced Perry Saturn on Jakked.\n\nAt this point Lombardi's in ring appearances became sporadic. After working a string of house show matches in January 2002, he would be inactive for the entire year. In 2003 he participated in the APA Invitational Battle Royal at Vengeance in Denver, Colorado on July 27.\n\nAfter being inactive during 2004, Lombardi returned on the April 18th, 2005 edition of Monday Night RAW which was held at Madison Square Garden. He appeared in a segment where John Heidenreich read a poem devoted to The Brooklyn Brawler. In response Brawler dismissed the poem, disowned the city of Brooklyn, and declared himself \"The Boston Brawler\". They then fought backstage. As part of an angle on \"SmackDown!\", he adopted the moniker of the \"Boston Brawler\", shedding his customary New York Yankees apparel in favor of Boston Red Sox clothing. This was done in response to the Red Sox' defeat of the Yankees in the 2004 American League Championship Series.\n\nHe reprised his role as Kim Chee, having apparently reconciled with Kamala, on the August 11, 2005 edition of SmackDown accompanying the Ugandan Giant to the ring for his match with Randy Orton. He would also appear with him on the June 26, 2006 episode for Kamala’s match against Umaga.\n\nIn early 2006, he still worked behind the scenes of WWE, including behind the camera with John Cena on his WWE.com show \"Five Questions\". Cena often makes references to Lombardi, even jokingly calling him the greatest technical wrestler of all time. Also, his face popped up in front of Cena's mouth to censor curse words, usually saying \"nu-uh\" or \"brawler\". On the June 2, 2006 episode of Five Questions, Brawler showed his face. He even censored himself, saying \"you are a piece of Brawler\". In another episode of \"Five Questions,\" Cena made the claim that Lombardi was actually born in Detroit, and not in Brooklyn, however this was later proven false (and likely a work). On May 7, 2006, WWE.com announced that, as part of Jakks Pacific's \"WWE Classic Superstars\" collection, they would be releasing a Brooklyn Brawler action figure. At Vengeance, Brawler appeared as Doink the Clown when he came out to the ring with Eugene during Eugene's match with Umaga. On August 1, 2006, Lombardi went to the ECW brand for a match against then ECW wrestler, Kurt Angle. Lombardi quickly lost when Angle applied an ankle lock on him. That same week, he appeared on \"SmackDown!\" against Vito, losing by submission. On the December 18 edition of \"Raw\", Lombardi appeared in the 30 man battle royal as the Brooklyn Brawler.\n\nOn the 15th anniversary of \"Raw\" on December 10, 2007, Lombardi appeared as Abe \"Knuckleball\" Schwartz in a segment. When Triple H saw him, he exclaimed \"I guess the Brooklyn Brawler was busy tonight\".\n\nOn the 10th anniversary of \"Smackdown\" on September 29, 2009, in Boston, Lombardi appeared as The Brooklyn Brawler in a backstage anniversary party along with numerous other wrestlers.\n\nLombardi made a return appearance in the November 15, 2010 \"Raw Goes Old School\" episode of \"Raw\" as the Brooklyn Brawler with Harvey Wippleman as his manager. He lost in a match against Ezekiel Jackson.\n\nThe Brooklyn Brawler made a surprise return to pay-per-view on December 16, 2012, at the pay-per-view (which took place at the recently-opened Barclays Center in Brooklyn), teaming with the Miz and Alberto Del Rio to defeat 3MB (Heath Slater, Drew McIntyre and Jinder Mahal). Brawler won the match for his team via submission with a Boston crab on Mahal.\n\nAt the July 15, 2013 \"Raw\" taping from Brooklyn, in a match taped for \"Superstars\", Lombardi competed in a match almost thirty years after his debut. Wrestling as the Brawler, he was defeated by Ryback. In May 2016, Lombardi was released from WWE, thus ending Lombardi's 33-year career with WWE.\n\nOn January 22, 2018, Lombardi made an appearance at \"Raw 25 Years\" in a backstage segment with Curt Hawkins.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2212498", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2212498", "title": "Iron Knob", "text": "Iron Knob\n\nIron Knob is a town in the Australian state of South Australia on the Eyre Peninsula immediately south of the Eyre Highway. At the 2006 census, Iron Knob and the surrounding area had a population of 199. The town obtained its name from its proximity to large deposits of iron ore, most notably Iron Monarch which outcropped prominently from the relatively flat, surrounding landscape.\n\nThe name Iron Knob first appeared on pastoral lease maps of 1854, and the first mineral claim in the area was pegged by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company in 1897. Mining commenced in 1900 and iron ore was transported by bullock wagon to Port Augusta then by rail to Whyalla and ship to Port Pirie where it was used as a flux in the lead smelter there. In 1901 the BHP Whyalla Tramway from Iron Knob to Hummock Hill (later renamed Whyalla) was completed, followed by wharves in 1903. These allowed the direct loading of ships which could transport the ore across Spencer Gulf to Port Pirie.\n\nIron Knob's iron ore proved to be of such high quality (upwards of 60% purity) that it led to the development of the Australian steel industry. It supplied iron to Newcastle for and steel works established at Newcastle and Port Kembla in the 1910s and 1920s and Whyalla in the 1930s. The iron ore was transported by the BHP Whyalla Tramway to Whyalla where it was either smelted or dispatched by sea.\n\n21% of the steel required for the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge was quarried at Iron Knob and smelted at Port Kembla, New South Wales. The remaining 79% was imported from England.\n\nIn the 1920s, iron ore from Iron Knob was exported to the Netherlands and the United States of America. In the 1930s, customers included Germany and the United Kingdom.\n\nPrior to World War II, iron ore from Iron Knob was also exported to Japan. In the financial year 1935-36, 291,961 tonnes of ore from Iron Knob was shipped there via the seaport of Whyalla. This became a controversial matter in the late 1930s due in part to Australia's known reserves at the time being limited to Iron Knob and Yampi Sound in Western Australia. Japan was also considered an 'aggressor' nation following acts of war against China in 1937. Waterfront workers and seamen protested against the export of iron ore to Japan, leading to strikes and arrests.\n\nIn 1937, output from the Middleback Range, mostly from Iron Monarch was estimated at 2 mtpa. In 1939, it was referred to in England as the highest grade deposit of iron ore known in the world. In 1943, the iron Knob deposit was still delivering an average ore grade of 64 percent metallic content. In 1949, 99% of Australian demand for iron ore was met by supply from Iron Knob and associated mines in South Australia, having risen from 95% in 1943.\n\nAdditional deposits of iron ore were developed by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company further south along the Middleback Range. These include Iron Baron, Iron Prince and Iron Queen (discovered in 1920) and Iron Knight, Iron Duchess and Iron Duke (discovered in 1934).\n\nQuarrying for iron at Iron Knob and Iron Monarch ended in 1998. When the quarrying stopped, the town population reduced to 200 and Iron Knob was under threat of becoming a ghost town. However, due to rising prices of housing elsewhere, the town has attracted new residents seeking low cost residences. A home could be purchased for approximately A$35,000–70,000 and vacant land could be purchased for less than A$15,000.\n\nIn 2010, Onesteel (later Arrium) announced that it would return to Iron Knob to reopen the Iron Monarch mine. The Iron Monarch mine was prepared for reopening by Arrium in 2013. As of 2015, both Iron Monarch and Iron Duke continue to produce iron ore for export and for smelting at the Whyalla Steelworks.\n\nIn the early days of mining at Iron Knob, ironstone was carted by oxen to Hummock Hill (renamed Whyalla in 1914). Approximately 300 tonnes (331 U.S. tons) was delivered in a good week. Construction of a private railway greatly increased transportation rates and by 1939, 9,000 tonnes (9921 U.S. tons) of ore was delivered daily to Whyalla by rail. Later trains carried 2000-tonne (2205 U.S. tons) loads.\n\nShips operated by the BHP Shipping were similarly named \"Iron This\" and \"Iron That\", some of which were built by the company at the Whyalla Steelworks.\n\nHighway 1 regularly closes due to controlled explosion.\n\n\n"}

Her husband, Jiang Peikun (蔣培坤), was head of the Aesthetics Institute at the university.\n\nDing's seventeen-year-old son, Jiang Jielian (蔣捷連), was one of the first to be killed when the People's Liberation Army crushed the Tiananmen Square protests. He left the family home in defiance of the curfew. Accounts vary of what happened next. Eyewitnesses had told her that her son was shot and was left to bleed to death on the night of June 3, 1989. Ding says he was shot through the heart by riot police on the way to Tiananmen Square. He was rushed to the Beijing Children's Hospital, where he was pronounced \"Dead on arrival\".\n\nFollowing her son's death, Ding said she attempted suicide six times.\n\nIn August 1989, she met another bereaved mother, and found a commonality within the self-help group, which continued growing. She formed a network of some 150 other families who had lost sons and daughters during the 1989 Tiananmen massacre, and this group became known as \"Tiananmen Mothers\". Ever since that day, she has been asking the government to apologize for the deaths. She and some others have faced imprisonment, house-arrest, phone-tapping and constant surveillance.\n\nIn 1991, after an interview she gave to ABC News, the government prevented her and her husband from carrying out their work or research, and were barred from publishing domestically. Party membership was revoked. In addition, she was detained for more than 40 days. She was forced into early retirement. Since her release, she was under close supervision by the authorities. Harassment continued when on September 9, 1994, she was arrested in front of the University and held by police for two hours, for having had published an article in the foreign media \"hurtful to the people\". Again in 1995, she and her husband were arrested in Wuxi on August 18 and incarcerated until September 30, allegedly on \"economic matters\", and were denied visitors. In 1996 Ding's husband was forced to retire early. Since February 28, 2000, she has been under 24-hour surveillance by the authorities.\n\nIn 2004, she and other Tiananmen Mothers were put under house arrest shortly before the 15th anniversary of the massacre to prevent them from holding any public memorial or protest. She was allegedly told by a senior official that a review of the June 4, 1989 crackdown was \"out of the question.\" In 2006, Time magazine selected her as one of the \"60 Asian heroes\".\n\nShe has been collecting the names of those who were shot dead by the People's Liberation Army in Beijing around June 4, 1989. At the end of June 2006, Ding was able to confirm 186 deaths through her own efforts despite repeated harassment by the authorities. However, upon close inspection of the cause of deaths, not all individuals on Ding's list died directly at the hands of the army. For example, at least one of the individuals on the list had committed suicide after the uprising had been squashed.\n\nShe and her husband have been under house arrest as of May 24, 2004. On February 8, 2007, she won the Vasyl Stus \"Freedom-to-Write\" Award for her book \"Looking for the June 4 victims\". She was ordered to leave Beijing for a forced vacation during the 2008 Summer Olympics. Following the announcement that Liu Xiaobo had won the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize, and his dedication of his prize to those who died in 1989, dissident groups reported on October 18 she and her husband may have been taken into custody by police, and have not been seen or heard from for four days; their phones have been cut off.\n\nSince her son's death in the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Ding Zilin has been fighting for justice for the victims. Her activism has drawn international attention and association with recognizable human rights groups such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and HRIC (Human Rights in China). New York based human rights watchdog HRIC has been labelled by the Chinese government as a hostile organization. Because of Ding Zilins efforts Amnesty International has a political campaign to put pressure on the Chinese government to acknowledge and apologize for the deaths of so many citizens. Amnesty applauded the Chinese government in June 2007 for allowing Ding Zilin, her husband and two other dead citizens’ kin to light candles west of Tiananmen Square. Despite the minimal recognition from the government Amnesty urges Chinese authorities to allow open debate and more public memorials in order to help improve Chinas human rights record and the image of Beijing on the international stage. Ding Zilin and human rights groups demand the Chinese government to stop labelling the student protest with political jargon such as “counter-revolutionary rebellion”.\n\nTiananmen Mothers is an activist group of people who lost family members on June fourth. Spearheaded by Ding Zilin they have collected over one hundred names of individuals who openly state that they lost a loved one on that day. Over the past twenty years in public letters published by multiple sources including HRIC, The China Post, The New York Times, Time Magazine and Amnesty International, the Tiananmen Mothers continue to publish a list of demands:\n\n\nDespite her multiple arrests and constant surveillance, civil disobedience is Ding Zilin's daily choice, she never stops using her voice to speak out in non-violent ways against the violations of human rights committed by the Chinese government. On April 5, 2004 \"Time\" magazine said that Ding Zilin is “the symbolic leader for many people in China who want the government to account for its actions that night. She is a small woman with a strong voice. Her bereavement makes her powerful”. Author of \"Beijing Coma\", Ma Jian also discusses her civil disobedience in a June 4, 2008 \"New York Times\" article. He describes how she will once again defy authorities and lay a memorial off Chang'an Avenue. He suggests “behind the bravado, the party is as fearful as a deer in the headlights,” of displays of support that show that despite government efforts to erase history many refuse to forget.\n\nIn June 2009 in a Newsweek interview with Ding Zilin she condemns the actions and legacy of many historical figures. She questions why Deng Xiaoping was not brought to justice like the notorious former Cambodian Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot. Ding Zilin uses her son's story to spread the message of human rights in China and feels it should be a central political issue. She was disappointed when US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that close Sino-American Relations should not be overshadowed by human rights. She does, however, acknowledge that in 1995 Hillary Clinton helped to get her released from one of her many incarcerations. Ding Zilin condemns former President Bill Clinton for\nattending a ceremonial red carpet appearance in Tiananmen Square: “With the blood of the students still wet, the wounds still there, unhealed, how could Clinton step onto the red carpet to review Chinese troops?”. Human Rights Watch claims that on May 26, 1994, President Clinton said China had not made significant progress on many of the issues outlined in his 1993 Executive Order, however, a tough human rights policy was hampering the ability of the US to pursue other interests Human rights groups like HRIC, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch describe in their philosophies to be critical of governments gaining international power with bad human rights records.\n\nDing Zilin has dedicated the remainder of her life after her son's death to being a human rights activist. She has most recently spoken out in support of Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo. Her continued campaigning relies on support from fundraising organizations like Fill the Square.\n\n\n"}

The effect of the German study was that he retained much of the Neo-Classical flavor in his art while most other sculptors of his generation were drawn towards Beaux-Arts realism.\n\nHe returned to America in 1881. By virtue of being a native Ohioan, he was commissioned to sculpt two statues of the recently assassinated President Garfield; one for Cincinnati (Garfield's home city), and the other, in another pose, for the National Statuary Hall Collection at the United States Capitol. He moved to Rome, Italy, where he worked on the commissions, and made a study of ancient sculpture. He modeled three major male nudes during his years in Rome, including \"The Scraper\" (1883) and \"Caestus\" (1883-85). He returned to New York City in 1885, and opened a studio.\n\nIn 1887, he created a statue of Ohioan William Allen, also for Statuary Hall. In later years, he was to place statues of Oliver P.

Flessas (born June 2, 1959 in Miami, Florida), is the birth name of American actor Michael Flessas, who is of Greek ancestry. Flessas' most notable film role was \"Angry Man\" in the Cannes Film Festival 2000 Palme d'Or winning film \"Dancer in the Dark\" directed by Danish film director Lars von Trier. Originally, the director himself considered playing the role but, instead, the role was given to Flessas. \"Dancer in the Dark\" starred Icelandic singer/actress Björk who won the Best Actress award at Cannes for her role. French film icon, César Award winner, and Academy Award nominee Catherine Deneuve, and other noteworthy artists such as Academy Award and Tony Award winner Joel Grey, Peter Stormare, David Morse, and Stellan Skarsgård also performed in the multiple prize winning film. One of Björk's songs for the film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Song.\n\nIn Iranian actress/director Susan Taslimi's film \"Hus i helvete\" (The film's English title: \"All Hell Let Loose\"), starring Melinda Kinnaman, which won the Best Feature Film prize at the Brooklyn International Film Festival in 2003, Flessas played the vicious pornographer \"Videomannen\" in a nightmarish flashback scene in the film.\n\nFlessas also portrayed massive and deadly Russian hitman \"Jurij Rostoff\" in \"Beck - Okänd avsändare\", a made for television movie directed by Swedish actor and director Harald Hamrell. \"Beck - Okänd avsändare\" was among the popular Swedish \"Beck\" detective films and made-for-television movies starring Swedish actor Peter Haber. As \"Jurij Rostoff\" Flessas weighed in at 150 kilos in the role as a result of weight training and diet; however, in his younger and less heavy years, Flessas danced in the corps de ballet of the Columbia City Ballet then under the direction of Ann Brodie in Columbia, South Carolina.\n\nAlthough he won two scholarships in Music, Flessas changed majors and majored in Religious Studies and minored in Philosophy at the University of South Carolina. Flessas did not complete his undergraduate degree at the University of South Carolina yet he continued his studies on an informal basis with travels around the world in order to meet and speak with adherents of various religious forms and philosophical points of view.\n\nFlessas began his professional acting career after hearing a barber mention that a :Fox Broadcasting Company series in Boston was about to begin production. Although the series, Against the Law starring Academy award nominee Michael O'Keefe lasted for one season, Flessas was in six episodes of the show as an uncredited extra. Flessas was able to do six episodes by constantly changing his facial appearance for each episode of the series. Flessas also was an uncredited extra in films such as HouseSitter, starring Emmy Award winner Steve Martin and Academy Award winner Goldie Hawn, :Wind, starring Academy Award winner Cliff Robertson, Matthew Modine, and Jennifer Grey, and the NBC made for television movie starring Grammy Award winner Kenny Rogers.\n\nFlessas also gained notoriety in the mid-1990s for his creation of a now defunct website entitled \"Resources for the Homeless\" which was one of the first websites in the United States of America solely devoted to helping the homeless through individual initiative by offering the homeless relevant data on resources via one website. At the time, many poor people were being removed from Milwaukee, Wisconsin welfare rolls while many Milwaukee city officials were engaged in plans to fund and build a new multimillion-dollar stadium. Flessas perceived the situation (building a new stadium while removing the poor from welfare) as an injustice to the poor. Given that libraries in Milwaukee, Wisconsin were just connecting to the World Wide Web, Flessas gathered and placed information regarding all the services available to the homeless in Milwaukee on the web so service providers to the homeless and the homeless themselves (who often sought shelter in local libraries) had equal and rapid access to information about resources available in Milwaukee via the Milwaukee County library system computer network \"OMNINET\".\n\n\"Resources for the Homeless\" was considered an unusual information delivery solution at the time given the new nature of the method of delivery and the biased misperception that the homeless did not and would not use computers to learn about resources available. The \"Resources for the Homeless\" project in Milwaukee received no direct funding for it was Flessas' express purpose to show what one person with computing skills could do to help the homeless with the use of the web. The project began in Milwaukee on a freenet and, later, a similar site was created with the help of a local web designer in Columbia, South Carolina. Flessas' exploits with the site were reported on television in Milwaukee, WIS television in Columbia, and in an article in Silicon Valley's \"San Jose Mercury News\" newspaper.\n\nIn a newspaper article in Columbia South Carolina's \"The State\" newspaper, Flessas promoted the use of e-mail in the 1990s to broadcast a demand (then akin to what is now guerrilla communication and subvertising) that thousands of potential visitors to South Carolina boycott the state's multimillion-dollar tourism industry to force state government officials to remove the Confederate flag from South Carolina's State House dome. (Flessas, curiously enough, through his mother's side of the family, is a descendant of Elisha Jefferson \"Elijah\" Sutherland who fought with the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War.) Social and political activism is not unknown in the Flessas Family for Flessas himself (through his father's side of the family) is also a direct descendant of Papaflessas through Papaflessas' father Demetrios Flessas.\n\nMicheal Christian Flessas, as he is now called, is now living in the city Katrineholm in Sweden.\n\n"}
{"id": "2212520", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2212520", "title": "United National South West Party", "text": "United National South West Party\n\nThe United National South West Party (, ) was a political party in South West Africa, the local counterpart of the United Party (South Africa) but founded eight years earlier and merged into the latter in 1971. It was formed through a merger of National Party of South West Africa and the South West Party, in order to counter the influence of the German League in South West Africa. The first congress of UNSWP was held in Windhoek on 1–2 April 1927.\n\nThe UNSWP favoured incorporation of South West Africa into South Africa, and won elections to the Legislative Assembly elections in 1929, 1934, 1940 and 1945.\n\nWith the coming of the National Party of South West Africa in the late 1930s, some Afrikaners switched loyalties to the new party. Meanwhile, after 1939 the policy of the UNSWP tended to follow Gen. Smuts instead of Gen. Hertzog, in part because of the fear of a new German interest in the territory. It continued to control the Legislative Assembly until 1950, at which point it held fifteen of the eighteen seats. But the National Party had won control in South Africa in 1948, and in 1950 elections in Namibia the National Party won sixteen seats while the UNSWP retained only two (which it lost in 1966). However, they continued running for the six local seats in the House of Assembly of South Africa in five South African general elections, in 1953, 1958, 1961, 1966, and 1970. Despite good organization and the support of over 40% of South-West Africans in the first three of those elections, the party never succeeded in sending a single representative to the House of Assembly.\n\nThe main publication of UNSWP was the newspaper \"Die Suidwes Afrikaner\".\n\nThe United Party started under very different circumstances in South-West Africa from those from which it sprang in Union of South Africa. Under the terms of the South-West Africa Constitution Act of 1925, the South African Parliament granted a Legislative Assembly to the mandate area, conditioning the informal politics of the region's white settlers along more conventional partisan lines. The Germans organized into the German League in South West Africa(German: \"Deutscher Bund in Südwestafrika\", DBSW), while Afrikaners were divided between the local National Party (South Africa) (NPSWA) and the South West Party (SWP, a local counterpart of the South African Party in the Union). The SWP formed a coalition with the NPSWA in the 1926 legislative election but lost to the DBSW. The SWP and NSWA thus were compelled to merge into the UNSWP on January 31, 1927. Campaigning on economic progress and annexation to South Africa, the coalition won the 1929 election.\n\nWorld War II robbed the DBSW of its influence and thus undermined the UNSWP's \"raison d'être\". The local National Party was re-founded there, but struggled until its Union election triumph in 1948. Prime Minister Daniel Malan passed legislation making the growing region the Union of South Africa's fifth province, and that year the NP won six local seats in the House of Assembly, both local Senate seats, and 15 out of 18 constituencies in the Legislative Assembly. The UNSWP eventually lost the other three Legislative Assembly seats, but the party remained vibrant locally under the leadership of J.P. de M. Niehaus, who was nominated as Senator for Natal by the national United Party as a reward for his work.\n\nOn November 16, 1971, the UNSWP was merged into the United Party of South Africa (UP) as a provincial party. Senator Niehaus was elected chairman of the South West Africa United Party. He lost his Natal seat when the Senate was reorganized after the April 1974 South African general election.\n\nMalan wanted to build upon his parliamentary majority after the NP's narrow victory in the 1948 South African general election, and therefore was keen on following in the footsteps of his predecessor Jan Smuts, who had already advocated for South West African representation in Parliament. Thus, in 1949 South West Africa was assigned six seats in the House of Assembly and four in the Senate (two Senators elected, two appointed). The South West African seats averaged half the population compared to those in the Union proper. With this legislation, Malan made South West Africa in effect the fifth province in the Union, defying the 1946 United Nations agreement with Smuts that forbade such annexation.\n\nThe six Assembly seats were Windhoek (constituency), Namib (constituency), Karas (constituency), Etosha (constituency), Midelland (constituency), and Omaruru (constituency). The Legislative Assembly, which had included some appointed members, was transformed into one where all 18 representatives were elected. The UP, though in principle supportive of representation for South West Africa, opposed the high number of seats relative to the local white population but did not wish to alienate local voters by opposing it strongly, and hoped its leaders' role in occupying the former German colony in 1915 would work in its favor.\n\nThe 1950 South West African legislative election was thus held. The incumbent UP local government had always resisted efforts to place South West Africa under UN trusteeship, but nevertheless agreed to submit annual reports to the UN. After the NP harshly criticized the first report, the UP decided to stop filing them. In 1949, the UN approached the World Court for an advisory opinion on the Union's treatment of the area. The majority verdict of the court in July 1950 stated that while the Union was not obliged to submit the area to full UN administration, it was still to be overseen along the lines of the old League of Nations mandate.\n\nThe international controversy over South West Africa gave the NP ample motivation to oppose the UNSWP, but the latter nonetheless had so far prevailed with the support of the South African opposition. The NP slogan held that they would not throw the territory \"to the wolves.\" In contrast to South Africa in 1948 and 1953, most voters supported the NP (12,434 or 55.4%) over the UNSWP (10,003 or 44.6%), padding the federal upper house majority for the NP nationally and winning a comfortable 13 seats in the Union People's Council. In all six seats, except for Etosha where the NP won by 846, the UNSWPNP only narrowly won winning by 67 votes in Karas, 229 in Middelland, 441 in Namib, 584 in Omaruru, and 234 in Windhoek.\n\nFrom 1953 onward, South West African and South African elections coincided. In 1953, the NP won locally 13,305 votes (56.6%) to the UNSWP's 10,021 (42.6%), winning Assembly seats by 1,205 votes in Etosha, 238 votes in Karas, 272 in Middelland, 554 in Namib, 826 in Omaruru, and 189 in Windhoek. In 1958, the NP won locally 16,390 votes (58.2%) to the UNSWP's 11,568 (41.1%), by a margin of 1,334 votes in Etosha, 449 votes in Karas, 604 in Middelland, 689 in Namib, 1,204 in Omaruru, and 506 in Windhoek. The UNSWP gradually declined and in 1970, the last election in which it participated, only contested four of the six Assembly seats and 28.8% of the vote.\n\nAndries de Wet\n\n"}

{"id": "2212557", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2212557", "title": "Crystallographic defects in diamond", "text": "Crystallographic defects in diamond\n\nImperfections in the crystal lattice of diamond are common. Such crystallographic defects in diamond may be the result of lattice irregularities or extrinsic substitutional or interstitial impurities, introduced during or after the diamond growth. The defects affect the material properties of diamond and determine to which type a diamond is assigned; the most dramatic effects are on the diamond color and electrical conductivity, as explained by the electronic band structure.\n\nThe defects can be detected by different types of spectroscopy, including electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), luminescence induced by light (photoluminescence, PL) or electron beam (cathodoluminescence, CL), and absorption of light in the infrared (IR), visible and UV parts of the spectrum. The absorption spectrum is used not only to identify the defects, but also to estimate their concentration; it can also distinguish natural from synthetic or enhanced diamonds.\n\nThere is a tradition in diamond spectroscopy to label a defect-induced spectrum by a numbered acronym (e.g. GR1). This tradition has been followed in general with some notable deviations, such as A, B and C centers. Many acronyms are confusing though:\n\nThe symmetry of defects in crystals is described by the point groups. They differ from the space groups describing the symmetry of crystals by absence of translations, and thus are much fewer in number. In diamond, only defects of the following symmetries have been observed thus far: tetrahedral (T), tetragonal (D), trigonal (D,C), rhombic (C), monoclinic (C, C, C) and triclinic (C or C).\n\nThe defect symmetry allows predicting many optical properties. For example, one-phonon (infrared) absorption in pure diamond lattice is forbidden because the lattice has an inversion center. However, introducing any defect (even \"very symmetrical\", such as N-N substitutional pair) breaks the crystal symmetry resulting in defect-induced infrared absorption, which is the most common tool to measure the defect concentrations in diamond.\n\nIn synthetic diamond grown by the high-pressure high-temperature synthesis or chemical vapor deposition, defects with symmetry lower than tetrahedral align to the direction of the growth. Such alignment has also been observed in gallium arsenide and thus is not unique to diamond.\n\nVarious elemental analyses of diamond reveal a wide range of impurities. They mostly originate, however, from inclusions of foreign materials in diamond, which could be nanometer-small and invisible in an optical microscope. Also, virtually any element can be hammered into diamond by ion implantation. More essential are elements that can be introduced into the diamond lattice as isolated atoms (or small atomic clusters) during the diamond growth. By 2008, those elements are nitrogen, boron, hydrogen, silicon, phosphorus, nickel, cobalt and perhaps sulfur. Manganese and tungsten have been unambiguously detected in diamond, but they might originate from foreign inclusions. Detection of isolated iron in diamond has later been re-interpreted in terms of micro-particles of ruby produced during the diamond synthesis. Oxygen is believed to be a major impurity in diamond, but it has not been spectroscopically identified in diamond yet. Two electron paramagnetic resonance centers (OK1 and N3) have been assigned to nitrogen–oxygen complexes. However, the assignment is indirect and the corresponding concentrations are rather low (few parts per million).\n\nThe most common impurity in diamond is nitrogen, which can comprise up to 1% of a diamond by mass. Previously, all lattice defects in diamond were thought to be the result of structural anomalies; later research revealed nitrogen to be present in most diamonds and in many different configurations. Most nitrogen enters the diamond lattice as a single atom (i.e. nitrogen-containing molecules dissociate before incorporation), however, molecular nitrogen incorporates into diamond as well.\n\nAbsorption of light and other material properties of diamond are highly dependent upon nitrogen content and aggregation state. Although all aggregate configurations cause absorption in the infrared, diamonds containing aggregated nitrogen are usually colorless, i.e. have little absorption in the visible spectrum. The four main nitrogen forms are as follows:\n\nThe C center corresponds to electrically neutral single substitutional nitrogen atoms in the diamond lattice. These are easily seen in electron paramagnetic resonance spectra (in which they are confusingly called P1 centers). C centers impart a deep yellow to brown color; these diamonds are classed as \"type Ib\" and are commonly known as \"canary diamonds\", which are rare in gem form. Most synthetic diamonds produced by high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) technique contain a high level of nitrogen in the C form; nitrogen impurity originates from the atmosphere or from the graphite source. One nitrogen atom per 100,000 carbon atoms will produce yellow color. Because the nitrogen atoms have five available electrons (one more than the carbon atoms they replace), they act as \"deep donors\"; that is, each substituting nitrogen has an extra electron to donate and forms a donor energy level within the band gap. Light with energy above ~2.2 eV can excite the donor electrons into the conduction band, resulting in the yellow color.\n\nThe C center produces a characteristic infrared absorption spectrum with a sharp peak at 1344 cm and a broader feature at 1130 cm. Absorption at those peaks is routinely used to measure the concentration of single nitrogen. Another proposed way, using the UV absorption at ~260 nm, has later been discarded as unreliable.\n\nAcceptor defects in diamond ionize the fifth nitrogen electron in the C center converting it into C+ center. The latter has a characteristic IR absorption spectrum with a sharp peak at 1332 cm and broader and weaker peaks at 1115, 1046 and 950 cm.\n\nThe A center is probably the most common defect in natural diamonds. It consists of a neutral nearest-neighbor pair of nitrogen atoms substituting for the carbon atoms. The A center produces UV absorption threshold at ~4 eV (310 nm, i.e. invisible to eye) and thus causes no coloration. Diamond containing nitrogen predominantly in the A form as classed as \"type IaA\".\n\nThe A center is diamagnetic, but if ionized by UV light or deep acceptors, it produces an electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum W24, whose analysis unambiguously proves the N=N structure.\n\nThe A center shows an IR absorption spectrum with no sharp features, which is distinctly different from that of the C or B centers. Its strongest peak at 1282 cm is routinely used to estimate the nitrogen concentration in the A form.\n\nThere is a general consensus that B center (sometimes called B1) consists of a carbon vacancy surrounded by four nitrogen atoms substituting for carbon atoms. This model is consistent with other experimental results, but there is no direct spectroscopic data corroborating it. Diamonds where most nitrogen forms B centers are rare and are classed as \"type IaB\"; most gem diamonds contain a mixture of A and B centers, together with N3 centers.\n\nSimilar to the A centers, B centers do not induce color, and no UV or visible absorption can be attributed to the B centers. Early assignment of the N9 absorption system to the B center have been disproven later. The B center has a characteristic IR absorption spectrum (see the infrared absorption picture above) with a sharp peak at 1332 cm and a broader feature at 1280 cm. The latter is routinely used to estimate the nitrogen concentration in the B form.\n\nNote that many optical peaks in diamond accidentally have similar spectral positions, which causes much confusion among gemologists. Spectroscopists use the whole spectrum rather than one peak for defect identification and consider the history of the growth and processing of individual diamond.\n\nThe N3 center consists of three nitrogen atoms surrounding a vacancy. Its concentration is always just a fraction of the A and B centers. The N3 center is paramagnetic, so its structure is well justified from the analysis of the EPR spectrum P2. This defect produces a characteristic absorption and luminescence line at 415 nm and thus does not induce color on its own. However, the N3 center is always accompanied by the N2 center, having an absorption line at 478 nm (and no luminescence). As a result, diamonds rich in N3/N2 centers are yellow in color.\n\nDiamonds containing boron as a substitutional impurity are termed \"type IIb\". Only one percent of natural diamonds are of this type, and most are blue to grey. Boron is an acceptor in diamond: boron atoms have one less available electron than the carbon atoms; therefore, each boron atom substituting for a carbon atom creates an electron hole in the band gap that can accept an electron from the valence band. This allows red light absorption, and due to the small energy (0.37 eV) needed for the electron to leave the valence band, holes can be thermally released from the boron atoms to the valence band even at room temperatures. These holes can move in an electric field and render the diamond electrically conductive (i.e., a p-type semiconductor). Very few boron atoms are required for this to happen—a typical ratio is one boron atom per 1,000,000 carbon atoms.\n\nBoron-doped diamonds transmit light down to ~250 nm and absorb some red and infrared light (hence the blue color); they may phosphoresce blue after exposure to shortwave ultraviolet light. Apart from optical absorption, boron acceptors have been detected by electron paramagnetic resonance.\n\nPhosphorus could be intentionally introduced into diamond grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) at concentrations up to ~0.01%. Phosphorus substitutes carbon in the diamond lattice. Similar to nitrogen, phosphorus has one more electron than carbon and thus acts as a donor; however, the ionization energy of phosphorus (0.6 eV) is much smaller than that of nitrogen (1.7 eV) and is small enough for room-temperature thermal ionization. This important property of phosphorus in diamond favors electronic applications, such as UV light-emitting diodes (LEDs, at 235 nm).\n\nHydrogen is one of the most technological important impurities in semiconductors, including diamond. Hydrogen-related defects are very different in natural diamond and in synthetic diamond films. Those films are produced by various chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques in an atmosphere rich in hydrogen (typical hydrogen/carbon ratio >100), under strong bombardment of growing diamond by the plasma ions. As a result, CVD diamond is always rich in hydrogen and lattice vacancies. In polycrystalline films, much of the hydrogen may be located at the boundaries between diamond 'grains', or in non-diamond carbon inclusions. Within the diamond lattice itself, hydrogen-vacancy and hydrogen-nitrogen-vacancy complexes have been identified in negative charge states by electron paramagnetic resonance. In addition, numerous hydrogen-related IR absorption peaks are documented.\n\nIt is experimentally demonstrated that hydrogen passivates electrically active boron and phosphorus impurities. As a result of such passivation, shallow donor centers are presumably produced.\n\nIn natural diamonds, several hydrogen-related IR absorption peaks are commonly observed; the strongest ones are located at 1405, 3107 and 3237 cm (see IR absorption figure above). The microscopic structure of the corresponding defects is yet unknown and it is not even certain whether or not those defects originate in diamond or in foreign inclusions. Gray color in some diamonds from the Argyle mine in Australia is often associated with those hydrogen defects, but again, this assignment is yet unproven.\n\nWhen diamonds are grown by the high-pressure high-temperature technique, nickel, cobalt, chromium or some other metals are usually added into the growth medium to facilitate catalytically the conversion of graphite into diamond. As a result, metallic inclusions are formed. Besides, isolated nickel and cobalt atoms incorporate into diamond lattice, as demonstrated through characteristic hyperfine structure in electron paramagnetic resonance, optical absorption and photoluminescence spectra, and the concentration of isolated nickel can reach 0.01%. This fact is by all means unusual considering the large difference in size between carbon and transition metal atoms and the superior rigidity of the diamond lattice.\n\nNumerous Ni-related defects have been detected by electron paramagnetic resonance, optical absorption and photoluminescence, both in synthetic and natural diamonds. Three major structures can be distinguished: substitutional Ni, nickel-vacancy and nickel-vacancy complex decorated by one or more substitutional nitrogen atoms. The \"nickel-vacancy\" structure, also called \"semi-divacancy\" is specific for most large impurities in diamond and silicon (e.g., tin in silicon). Its production mechanism is generally accepted as follows: large nickel atom incorporates substitutionally, then expels a nearby carbon (creating a neighboring vacancy), and shifts in-between the two sites.\n\nAlthough the physical and chemical properties of cobalt and nickel are rather similar, the concentrations of isolated cobalt in diamond are much smaller than those of nickel (parts per billion range). Several defects related to isolated cobalt have been detected by electron paramagnetic resonance and photoluminescence, but their structure is yet unknown.\n\nA chromium-related optical center has been detected in diamond after ion implantation and subsequent annealing.\n\nSilicon is a common impurity in diamond films grown by chemical vapor deposition and it originates either from silicon substrate or from silica windows or walls of the CVD reactor. It was also observed in natural diamonds in dispersed form. Isolated silicon defects have been detected in diamond lattice through the sharp optical absorption peak at 738 nm and electron paramagnetic resonance. Similar to other large impurities, the major form of silicon in diamond has been identified with a Si-vacancy complex (semi-divacancy site). This center is a deep donor having an ionization energy of 2 eV, and thus again is unsuitable for electronic applications.\n\nSi-vacancies constitute minor fraction of total silicon. It is believed (though no proof exists) that much silicon substitutes for carbon thus becoming invisible to most spectroscopic techniques because silicon and carbon atoms have the same configuration of the outer electronic shells.\n\nGermanium, tin and lead are normally absent in diamond, but they can be introduced during the growth or by subsequent ion implantation. Those impurities can be detected optically via the germanium-vacancy, tin-vacancy and lead-vacancy centers, respectively, which have similar properties to those of the Si-vacancy center.\n\nSimilar to N-V centers, Si-V, Ge-V, Sn-V and Pb-V complexes all have potential applications in quantum computing.\n\nAround the year 2000, there was a wave of attempts to dope synthetic CVD diamond films by sulfur aiming at n-type conductivity with low activation energy. Successful reports have been published, but then dismissed as the conductivity was rendered p-type instead of n-type and associated not with sulfur, but with residual boron, which is a highly efficient p-type dopant in diamond.\n\nSo far (2009), there is only one reliable evidence (through hyperfine interaction structure in electron paramagnetic resonance) for isolated sulfur defects in diamond. The corresponding center called W31 has been observed in natural type-Ib diamonds in small concentrations (parts per million). It was assigned to a sulfur-vacancy complex – again, as in case of nickel and silicon, a semi-divacancy site.\n\nThe easiest way to produce intrinsic defects in diamond is by displacing carbon atoms through irradiation with high-energy particles, such as alpha (helium), beta (electrons) or gamma particles, protons, neutrons, ions, etc. The irradiation can occur in the laboratory or in nature (see Diamond enhancement – Irradiation); it produces primary defects named Frenkel defects (carbon atoms knocked off their normal lattice sites to interstitial sites) and remaining lattice vacancies. An important difference between the vacancies and interstitials in diamond is that whereas interstitials are mobile during the irradiation, even at liquid nitrogen temperatures, however vacancies start migrating only at temperatures ~700 °C.\n\nVacancies and interstitials can also be produced in diamond by plastic deformation, though in much smaller concentrations.\n\nIsolated interstitial has never been observed in diamond and is considered unstable. Its interaction with a regular carbon lattice atom produces a \"split-interstitial\", a defect where two carbon atoms share a lattice site and are covalently bonded with the carbon neighbors. This defect has been thoroughly characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance (R2 center) and optical absorption, and unlike most other defects in diamond, it does not produce photoluminescence.\n\nThe isolated split-interstitial moves through the diamond crystal during irradiation. When it meets other interstitials it aggregates into larger complexes of two and three split-interstitials, identified by electron paramagnetic resonance (R1 and O3 centers), optical absorption and photoluminescence.\n\nMost high-energy particles, beside displacing carbon atom from the lattice site, also pass it enough surplus energy for a rapid migration through the lattice. However, when relatively gentle gamma irradiation is used, this extra energy is minimal. Thus the interstitials remain near the original vacancies and form vacancy-interstitials pairs identified through optical absorption.\n\nVacancy-di-interstitial pairs have been also produced, though by electron irradiation and through a different mechanism: Individual interstitials migrate during the irradiation and aggregate to form di-interstitials; this process occurs preferentially near the lattice vacancies.\n\nIsolated vacancy is the most studied defect in diamond, both experimentally and theoretically. Its most important practical property is optical absorption, like in the color centers, which gives diamond green, or sometimes even green–blue color (in pure diamond). The characteristic feature of this absorption is a series of sharp lines called GR1-8, where GR1 line at 741 nm is the most prominent and important.\n\nThe vacancy behaves as a deep electron donor/acceptor, whose electronic properties depend on the charge state. The energy level for the +/0 states is at 0.6 eV and for the 0/- states is at 2.5 eV above the valence band.\n\nUpon annealing of pure diamond at ~700 °C, vacancies migrate and form divacancies, characterized by optical absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance.\nSimilar to single interstitials, divacancies do not produce photoluminescence. Divacancies, in turn, anneal out at ~900 °C creating multivacancy chains detected by EPR and presumably hexavacancy rings. The latter should be invisible to most spectroscopies, and indeed, they have not been detected thus far. Annealing of vacancies changes diamond color from green to yellow-brown. Similar mechanism (vacancy aggregation) is also believed to cause brown color of plastically deformed natural diamonds.\n\nDislocations are the most common structural defect in natural diamond. The two major types of dislocations are the \"glide set\", in which bonds break between layers of atoms with different indices (those not lying directly above each other) and the \"shuffle set\", in which the breaks occur between atoms of the same index. The dislocations produce dangling bonds which introduce energy levels into the band gap, enabling the absorption of light. Broadband blue photoluminescence has been reliably identified with dislocations by direct observation in an electron microscope, however, it was noted that not all dislocations are luminescent, and there is no correlation between the dislocation type and the parameters of the emission.\n\nMost natural diamonds contain extended planar defects in the <100> lattice planes, which are called platelets. Their size ranges from nanometers to many micrometers, and large ones are easily observed in an optical microscope via their luminescence. For a long time, platelets were tentatively associated with large nitrogen complexes — nitrogen sinks produced as a result of nitrogen aggregation at high temperatures of the diamond synthesis. However, the direct measurement of nitrogen in the platelets by EELS (an analytical technique of electron microscopy) revealed very little nitrogen. The currently accepted model of platelets is a large regular array of carbon interstitials.\n\nPlatelets produce sharp absorption peaks at 1359–1375 and 330 cm in IR absorption spectra; remarkably, the position of the first peak depends on the platelet size. As with dislocations, a broad photoluminescence centered at ~1000 nm was associated with platelets by direct observation in an electron microscope. By studying this luminescence, it was deduced that platelets have a \"bandgap\" of ~1.7 eV.\n\nVoidites are octahedral nanometer-sized clusters present in many natural diamonds, as revealed by electron microscopy. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that annealing of type-IaB diamond at high temperatures and pressures (>2600 °C) results in break-up of the platelets and formation of dislocation loops and voidites, i.e. that voidites are a result of thermal degradation of platelets. Contrary to platelets, voidites do contain much nitrogen, in the molecular form.\n\nExtrinsic and intrinsic defects can interact producing new defect complexes. Such interaction usually occurs if a diamond containing extrinsic defects (impurities) is either plastically deformed or is irradiated and annealed.\nMost important is the interaction of vacancies and interstitials with nitrogen. Carbon interstitials react with substitutional nitrogen producing a bond-centered nitrogen interstitial showing strong IR absorption at 1450 cm. Vacancies are efficiently trapped by the A, B and C nitrogen centers. The trapping rate is the highest for the C centers, 8 times lower for the A centers and 30 times lower for the B centers. The C center (single nitrogen) by trapping a vacancy forms the famous nitrogen-vacancy center, which can be neutral or negatively charged; the negatively charged state has potential applications in quantum computing. A and B centers upon trapping a vacancy create corresponding 2N-V (H3 and H2 centers, where H2 is simply a negatively charged H3 center) and the neutral 4N-2V (H4 center). The H2, H3 and H4 centers are important because they are present in many natural diamonds and their optical absorption can be strong enough to alter the diamond color (H3 or H4 – yellow, H2 – green).\n\nBoron interacts with carbon interstitials forming a neutral boron–interstitial complex with a sharp optical absorption at 0.552 eV (2250 nm). No evidence is known so far (2009) for complexes of boron and vacancy.\n\nIn contrast, silicon does react with vacancies, creating the described above optical absorption at 738 nm. The assumed mechanism is trapping of migrating vacancy by substitutional silicon resulting in the Si-V (semi-divacancy) configuration.\n\nA similar mechanism is expected for nickel, for which both substitutional and semi-divacancy configurations are reliably identified (see subsection \"nickel and cobalt\" above). In an unpublished study, diamonds rich in substitutional nickel were electron irradiated and annealed, with following careful optical measurements performed after each annealing step, but no evidence for creation or enhancement of Ni-vacancy centers was obtained.\n"}

It also provides an emergency ambulance service for the sick and the injured, and gives fire protection advice to the public. The Hong Kong Fire Services Department (FSD) is under the Secretary for Security who heads the Security Bureau. The FSD is headquartered at 1 Hong Chong Road, Tsim Sha Tsui East, West Kowloon.\n\nThe history of the Hong Kong Fire Service began in the Government Gazette dated 9 May 1868. Charles May became the first Superintendent of the Fire Brigade. At the time, the Fire Department was part of the Hong Kong Police Force in 1846. It had a total strength of 62 with a supplement of 100 Chinese volunteers.\nThe fire department expanded to 140 members during the 1920s.\n\nDuring the Japanese Occupation during the World War II, the Service disbanded. The two fire engines were exported to Tokyo to become part of the Imperial Palace Fire Unit. It was only returned after the War.\n\nUnlike Canada, UK and some countries, Hong Kong's ambulance service is tied directly with the Fire Department. At that time all emergency ambulance service was provided by the Fire Service while non-emergency was handled by the Medical Corps. In 1950 the \"Auxiliary Fire Service Unit\" was created to establish the \"Hong Kong Auxiliary Fire Brigade\" to provide additional manpower to regular fire brigade members under the Essential Services (Auxiliary Fire Service) Corps Regulations.\n\nIn 1953, this policy was changed and all Medical Corps vehicles and crew were transferred to the Fire Service. Thus, leading to the creation to the present Ambulance Command. Over the past 50 years it has grown to accommodate 30 ambulance depots, 240 ambulances, 35 motorcycles and 2,350 uniformed staff.\n\nThe department has 9,351 (8,675 uniformed and 676 civilian) members. It is organised into seven commands － three operational commands, a Licensing and Certification Command, a Fire Safety Command, an Ambulance Command and a Headquarters Command. They are supported by an Administration Division. Commanding the department is the Director of Fire Services.\n\nFire-fighting, rescue and other emergency services are undertaken by the three operational commands － Hong Kong (including marine and off-shore islands), Kowloon and the New Territories. There are 81 fire stations across Hong Kong's 3 operational commands. In 2004, they responded to 35,092 fire calls and 20,059 special service calls. Careless handling or disposal of cigarette ends, matches and candles remained the major causes of fires, followed by incidents involving the preparation of food and electrical faults. Fires claimed nine lives and 451 injuries in 2004. Of the injured, 46 were Fire Services personnel. Special service calls cover a wide range of incidents, including traffic and industrial accidents, gas leakages, landslides, flooding, house collapses, attempts by people to jump from a height and malfunctioning lifts. In 2004, 717 people died and 1,995 others were injured in such incidents. One of the dead and 16 of the injured were Fire Services personnel. The department has 835 operational appliances and vehicles fitted with up-to-date fire-fighting and rescue equipment. The first-line appliances, basically comprising major pumps, hydraulic platforms, light rescue units and turntable ladders/snorkels, are supported where necessary by other special appliances/equipment. A fleet of eight fireboats, including two command boats, one diving support vessel and two diving support speedboats provide fire protection and rescue services within Hong Kong\n\nThe Ambulance Command operates from 38 depots with 2,350 uniformed staff. The services fleet consists of 268 ambulances, four village ambulances, four mobile casualty treatment centres and 35 paramedic motorcycles. All motorcycles and ambulances are equipped with paramedic facilities to provide paramedic care. In 2004, the Command responded to 574,901 calls, conveying a total of 521,127 patients or casualties to hospitals/clinics, or an average of 1 575 calls a day. There were 106 cases of ambulance personnel sustaining injury whilst on active duty in 2004. Front-line firemen are also trained as first-responders to provide basic life support to casualties and patients before the arrival of an ambulance crew. So far, first-responders are available in 81 fire stations.\n\nThe Fire Services Communication Centre (FSCC) is equipped with a computerised mobilising system for the efficient and effective mobilising of fire-fighting and ambulance resources for fires and emergencies. It is linked to all fire stations, ambulance depots and fireboat stations for dispatch of resources. The FSCC, manned round the clock, also caters for receipt of complaints and enquiries of fire hazards and dangerous goods. During major incidents, it acts as a co-ordinator for government departments and public utilities. The FSCC has five Mobile Command Units which serve as on-scene command and control centres in major incidents. The Third Generation Mobilising System came into operation in phases starting in the first quarter of 2005. The system's objective is to further enhance the capability and efficiency in mobilisation and communications to meet anticipated growth of emergency calls over the next decade.\n\nThe Licensing and Certification Command enforces fire safety regulations and policies, and processes the registration of fire service installation contractors. The Policy Division deals mainly with the formulation of guidelines on fire protection matters, prosecutions, research and approval of portable fire-fighting equipment and gas cylinders. The Dangerous Goods Division is responsible for the licensing of dangerous goods stores and vehicles, and timber stores. The Fire Service Installations Division and Ventilation Division are responsible for inspecting fire service installations and ventilating systems in buildings respectively. The two regional offices － the Hong Kong and Kowloon West and the New Territories and Kowloon East － are responsible for advising other government authorities on the fire safety measures for the purposes of licensing/registering various types of premises. Officers of the Command are seconded to the Home Affairs Department to inspect hotels, guesthouses, private clubs and bedspace apartments, and formulate fire safety requirements on these premises; whereas some are seconded to the Social Welfare Department to advise on fire protection measures in residential care homes for the elderly.\n\nThe Fire Safety Command assists and advises the public on fire protection measures with the aim of enhancing their fire safety awareness. The Community Relations Division is responsible for promoting fire safety and co-ordinating with other government departments and District Fire Safety Committees in stepping up fire prevention publicity. To promote fire safety awareness at district levels, the Division works closely with local fire stations in organising fire safety talks, seminars, exhibitions, fire drills and training of Fire Safety Ambassadors, who are volunteers from various sectors of the community to raise awareness of fire safety. The Commercial Buildings and Premises Division enforces the Fire Safety (Commercial Premises) Ordinance for upgrading fire safety measures in prescribed commercial premises (i.e. supermarkets, department stores, shopping arcades, banks, jewelry or goldsmith premises and off-course betting centres) and specified commercial buildings (i.e. commercial buildings constructed or the plans of building works of which first submitted to the Building Authority for approval on or before 1 March 1987). A Building Safety Loan Scheme has also been established to provide financial assistance to owners of such premises and buildings to upgrade the fire safety measures where necessary. Pending implementation of the Fire Safety (Buildings) Ordinance, the Building Improvement and Support Division continues to inspect old private composite and domestic buildings with a view to enhancing fire safety and advising owners and occupiers concerned on the improved standards to be required. The Fire Service Installation Task Force inspects fire service installations in buildings, handles complaints regarding building fire service installations and monitors the performance of registered fire service installation contractors. The Railway Development Strategy Division scrutinises fire safety strategies and processes building plans of new railway infrastructure projects. It also carries out acceptance tests of fire service installations on completion of those projects. The Theme Park Projects Division formulates fire safety requirements for buildings and other supporting infrastructures in the Hong Kong Disneyland theme park in Penny's Bay. It also carries out acceptance tests on fire service installations upon completion of these works.\n\nThe Headquarters Command offers policy, planning, management and logistic support to the operational commands. It also oversees the operation of Fire Services Communication Centre, Airport Fire Contingent, Fire Services Training School, recruitment and examination, workshops and transport, stores and supplies, diving service, physical training, information and publicity matters, staff welfare and statistics. The Administration Division, staffed by civilians, deals with departmental establishment, personnel, finance, appointments, general matters, staff relations, audit and translation service.\n\nThe primary role of the contingent is to provide rescue and fire fighting coverage for Hong Kong International Airport. The contingent, which comprises two fire stations (one next to DHL Asia Hub and one on Airport Road at Cathay Pacific City) and two sea rescue berths (east and west ends of Chep Lap Kok) at strategic locations on the airport platform, is equipped with 14 fire appliances, two command boats and eight speedboats.\n\nThe Diving Unit has a fleet of five diving tenders, one diving support vessel and two diving support speedboats deployed at seven strategic locations throughout Hong Kong, and a three-compartment compression chamber at Stonecutter's Island for treating patients suffering from decompression illness and requiring hyperbaric oxygen treatment. It comprises about 150 active divers responsible for maritime search and rescue within Hong Kong waters down to the maximum depth of 42 metres using compressed air diving equipment and underwater breaking-in tools.\n\nFire Services Training School (FSTS) provides initial training for recruit fire and ambulance personnel. It also provides refresher and advanced training courses for all fire personnel. Fire Services Ambulance Command Training School (FSACTS) provides initial and paramedic training to recruits and ambulance personnel. It also provides Advanced Ambulance Aid Training at first-responder level to serving fire personnel. The duration of various courses ranges from one day to 26 weeks. The fire and ambulance recruits who have successfully completed the initial training courses will be posted to fire stations and ambulance depots respectively to continue their on-the-job training in order to gain field experience. Apart from providing training for staff of other government departments, private organisations and overseas fire officers, FSTS also runs Youth Pre-employment Training Programmes and Smart Teen Challenge Camps for youngsters jointly with the Labour Department and the Education and Manpower Bureau respectively. FSACTS also provides initial and refresher training on cardio-pulmonary resuscitation to members of the public. In addition to overseas training on latest fire services technology and management skills, officers and instructors also attend various advanced courses conducted by overseas fire professionals in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Workshops Division is responsible for all engineering matters relating to fire appliances, fire-fighting and rescue equipment. These include design, development, procurement, inspection and maintenance, fitting out, modification, testing and commissioning.\n\nThere are altogether 81 fire stations, 37 ambulance depots and six fireboat stations. They are strategically located to provide an emergency response for all areas. The graded response times for building fire calls are six minutes for built-up areas and nine to 23 minutes for areas of dispersed risks and isolated developments. For emergency ambulance services, the target response time is 12 minutes. The performance target is to achieve these response times in 92.5% of all calls. In 2004, 94.06% of building fire calls and 91.08% of emergency ambulance calls were responded to within the respective target response times.\n\nThe group which comprises 30 members of the public from all walks of life monitors and improves the delivery of the department's public services. It helps foster better understanding between the public and the department.\n\nThe Fire Services Department of Hong Kong is a force of 8,000-plus firefighters serving one of the most densely populated urban areas in the world. They served under the British before 1997 and are equipped much like their counterparts in the United Kingdom.\n\nWhile most cities' high-rise buildings are concentrated in their commercial areas in the central business districts, they are ubiquitous in Hong Kong. Most residential buildings in this very crowded Asian metropolis are more than twenty storeys tall, with some reaching forty or fifty storeys and the tallest over seventy.\n\nThanks to strict fire code and the use of non-flammable materials, severe structural fires are rare. The Fire Services Department is nonetheless equipped with a significant quantity of hydraulic platforms and possesses some of the tallest ladder platforms in the world.\n\nCommon fire engines in Hong Kong include:\n\nThe following appliances are mainly deployed to the airport and stations close to fuel depots:\n\nA list of vehicles used in the past and present:\n\n\nFor funerals Turntable Ladder with turntable unit removed is used to carry the coffin.\n\n\nFor other ranks, the name of the station are printed on both sides of the helmet e.g. Shek Kip Mei - SKM on the sides of the helmet. All station names abbreviations are in letters form. However, this does not apply to officers as their rank is shown by stars and pipes on the side of their helmet, unlike other ranks who display their rank as thin lines on their helmets.\nfire retardant up to 1093c\n\n\nThe Director of Fire Services was created in 1961 and replaced the role of Chief Fire Officer and Superintendent of Fire Services:\n\n\n\n\nThe current Fire Service crest was adopted in 1997 to replace the pre-handover crest due to presence of colonial elements. The changes impacted both uniforms (lapels, buttons, helmets, caps), vehicles, flags and other signage.\n\nThe new crest removed all colonial elements. Laurel wreath was retained. St Edward's Crown was replaced with Bauhinia. The motto changed from the uni-lingual Fire Services - Hong Kong to the bilingual Fire Services Hong Kong (消防). The badge theme changed from a crowned lion holding a pearl to a pair of fire axes and a burning torch\n\nAs the crest was also used on the flag, it too was changed in 1997. The old red flag was replaced by a purple flag with the new crest. This flag is only flown at Headquarters, whereas the Flag of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region flies at all fire stations.\n\nSource: Hong Kong Fire Services Department\n\nThe FS has been portrayed in a number of Hong Kong TV series and films:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2212611", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2212611", "title": "New York Guard", "text": "New York Guard\n\nThe New York Guard (NYG) is the state defense force of New York State, also called The New York State Military Reserve. Originally called the New York State Militia it can trace its lineage back to the American Revolution and the War of 1812. , the New York Guard, a recognized command under the New York State's Military law, has line-item funding in the state budget.\n\nNow with a unified command structure, formerly the organization contained an Army Division and an Air Division. The missions of the New York Guard include augmentation, assistance, and support of the New York Army National Guard and New York Air National Guard respectively and aide to civil authorities in New York State. New York also has a New York Naval Militia which, with the State Guard and the Army and Air National Guards, is under the command of the Governor of New York, the Adjutant General of New York, and the Division of Military and Naval Affairs (DMNA).\n\nThe New York Guard is one of the largest and best organized State Guards in the United States. It is historically derived from Revolutionary and Civil War era state military units that were reorganized several times in American history in response to various international and domestic crises.\n\nOrganized under the Military Law, State of New York, the New York Guard cannot be federalized and cannot be deployed outside New York State without the consent of the governor.\n\nMembers of the New York Guard are entitled to many of the benefits accorded members of other components of the 'Organized Militia of the State of New York,' the legal collective term describing the New York Army and Air National Guards, New York Naval Militia and New York Guard. These include 'military leave' for employees of state or local governments and many private employers.\n\nThe 265th New York State Militia was a small unit of the New York line and could trace its lineage to the War of 1812. The new regiment was given the designation, 14th regiment, which is one of the oldest military organizations in the United States because of its direct lineage through various separate companies, to the militia companies of the Dutch burghers of New Amsterdam. \n\n\"For more detail, see List of New York Civil War Regiments\"\nMany units of the New York State Militia saw service in the American Civil War, after being activated into federal service by President Abraham Lincoln.\n\nThe activation of state militia by President Abraham Lincoln led to some conflict with State authorities in command of the units:\n\nWith the advent of the Civil War in April 1861, the 14th regiment saw its first war service in guarding the Brooklyn Navy Yard. By mid-April of that year, the \"Brooklyn Chasseurs\" were ready to leave New York for Washington D.C. Colonel Alfred Wood advised the Honorable Governor Morgan that the regiment was prepared to march and had accepted a three-year federal enlistment. However, the governor would not issue orders for the regiment to leave New York. While encamped at Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn, Colonel Wood and Congressman Moses O'Dell went to see President Lincoln to secure orders for the regiment to march to Washington. President Lincoln lost no time in issuing those orders to the 14th Brooklyn. When Governor Morgan learned that the regiment was preparing to march, he telegraphed Colonel Wood and inquired \"by what authority\" did he move his regiment, Colonel Wood coolly replied, \"By the authority of the President of the United States.\"\n\nFollowing the Civil War, efforts were made to link the varied military units in New York under overall headquarters. As a result of this, the 3rd Brigade, New York State Militia, came into being on August 5, 1886.\n\nOn August 3, 1917, the Adjutant General of New York, in order to comply with the provisions of the State Constitution requiring that troops be available to the Governor for the protection of life and property of the citizens of New York, organized a state military force known as the New York Guard. The new force replaced the New York National Guard, drafted in the service of the United States on August 5, 1917. The force consisted of the First and Second Provisional Regiments, guarding aqueducts and other infrastructure in the southern portion (First Provisional Regiment) and the remaining parts of the state.\n\nOn January 1, 1919, the Guard numbered 22,000 in active service. After the Armistice, federalized New York National Guard Units were returned to State control.\n\nOn May 21, 1924, Babe Ruth joined the New York National Guard and was Assigned to the 104th Field Artillery in Jamaica Queens Armory.\n\nGeorge Herman Ruth, popularly known as \"The Babe\", \"The Bambino\", and \"The Sultan of Swat\", was a member of the 104th Field Artillery in Jamaica Queens. On May 21, 1924* he signed the dotted line for three years and joined the ranks of civilian soldiers.\n\nBabe Ruth was sworn in by Colonel James Austin at the Isle of Safety in Times Square in front of a military tent used for enlistment drives. Once the enlistment papers were filled he symbolically placed them into the open jaws of a horse drawn French 75-millimeter gun. He was then immediately placed under the command of First Sergeant Adrian Jacques who was in charge of the regiment present. He served while he played in the stadium he was destined to rebuild. A May 29 Washington Post article reported that he appeared before General John Joseph Pershing at State, War and Navy building in Washington** once he was fitted and squared away.\n\nThe 104th Field Artillery underwent several changes over the years while in active duty. The unit served briefly under Federal control on November 5, 1916 for Mexican border control, then returned to state status on November 15, 1916. In addition, the unit was activated for Federal service during World War I and II. It wasn't until 1917 that the unit received its destination as the 104th Field Artillery and saw extensive service in France.\n\nAfter World War I, the unit was demobilized but shortly reactivated into the New York National Guard until 1959 when it reorganized as the 104th Field Artillery Regiment. Consolidated 1 September 1992 with the 104th Field Artillery and consolidated unit designated as the 258th Field Artillery, to consist of the 1st Battalion, an element of the 42d Infantry Division.\n\nWith the advent of World War II, New York National Guard units were federalized and the New York Guard was created for service to the State.\n\nIn 1942, former Heavyweight champion boxer Lt Jack Dempsey joined New York Guard.\n\nIn the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the New York Guard provided security, disaster relief, legal, communications and other services to New York City and the surrounding areas in cooperation with the National Guard. During this period, Major General John F. Bahrenburg was Commander of the New York Guard (his tenure as Commander was from 1999 to 2002).\n\nThe New York Guard experienced a resurgence after the September 11, 2001 attacks. New York Guard units were activated after the attacks, performing a variety of missions, including, logistical support to forces stationed at \"Ground Zero\". Medical units of the Guard worked in conjunction with other DMNA forces providing care at several location including Camp Smith, in Westchester county. \n\nPrincipal occupational specialties of the New York Guard include, communications, engineering, medical and legal services, provided in support of all components of New York State military forces, i.e., the Army and Air National Guards, Naval Militia and the New York Guard, as well as to civil authorities.\n\nTrained and state-certified New York Guard soldiers augment and assist National Guard units in the following missions: weapons of mass destruction [WMD] decontamination – the joint New York Army National Guard / New York Air National Guard / New York Guard decontamination, or CERF, team was activated by the governor for state duty for 11 days during the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York City, Military Emergency Radio Network – the Guard is assigned to operate the MERN at various locations to ensure the free flow of information during an emergency, and search and rescue (SAR) a secondary mission to the state. New York Guard SAR teams have been mobilized, for example, in the summer of 2006 to search for a missing camper in the Adirondack Mountains preserve. Selected units and personnel of the New York Guard were called to State Active Duty with pay in response to Hurricane Irene in 2011.\n\n2012 saw the largest deployment of the New York Guard since the September 11, 2001 attacks. Every brigade was at least partially activated for service during 'Superstorm' Sandy. New York Guard members served as equals alongside the Army National Guard, Air National Guard, and New York Naval Militia, at one point making up approximately one third of all troops in the field during a two-month deployment.\n\nNew York State Guard personnel provide training to the New York Army and Air national guards including first aid and firearms training at Camp Smith training center.\n\nThe 244th Medical Clinic works with the NY Army National Guard Medical Command (MEDCOM), augmenting National Guard personnel for in-state MEDCOM missions. These have included screening of National Guard personnel in Soldier Readiness Programs and 'reintegration' programs for both soldiers and their families upon troops' return from overseas deployment.\n\nIn addition to its SAR work as a secondary mission under the New York State Defense Emergency Act and Article 2-B of State and Local, Natural and Man-Made disasters Act, engineer units of the NY Guard 10th and 65th Brigades have built facilities for the National Guard.\n\nCivil affairs units provide legal services to about-to-deploy troops such as wills and counseling on legal protections under federal and state law.\n\nThe New York Guard augments the capabilities of the National Guard, serving only within New York State. Guard personnel are drawn from almost every profession – from plumbers to professors, clerks and CEOs, persons with long prior military service and those without, and every part of the state.\n\nThe headquarters unit of the New York Guard is located at Camp Smith, Cortlandt Manor, New York. Camp Smith is a New York State military reservation. It is adjacent to Peekskill, New York, and about 35 miles north of New York City.\n\nIn March 2020, 60 New York Guard members were activated to support National Guard efforts at combating the coronavirus pandemic. State guardsmen were activated to serve in essential command and control roles to support operations throughout New York State.\n\nThe major subordinate commands of the New York Guard are:\n\nTo join, an applicant must be between 18–62 years of age, a citizen of the United States, and be in reasonably good health.\n\nThe following are some of the many positions in the New York state guard:\n\n\nAll New York Guard enlisted recruits, unless they have prior military experience, must attend Initial Entry Training (IET). After completion of one week of IET at Camp Smith, soldiers may take any of the following courses based on their TDA position and rank. Officers, unless they have prior commissioned military experience, must complete the officer's basic course after appointment.\n\nThe following schools are offered by the New York Guard.\n\nMost NYG soldiers have augmented their training by taking courses with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and various other local and state agencies.\n\nTo reward service to the nation, state and community, government and private organizations provide benefits to NY Guard soldiers. The benefits include:\n\nBusinesses in New York are forbidden from adopting policies that discriminate against members of the New York Guard during the hiring process or after a person has already been hired. Individuals who enforce such policies or in any way discriminate against New York Guard employees in regards to their employment are guilty under New York law of a misdemeanor offense. Employers in the state of New York are required under New York law to grant a leave of absence to employees who are also members of the NYG whenever these employees are activated to take part in drill, training, or an emergency mission. Employers are then required to reinstate these employees to their previous positions of employment when they return from their deployment.\n\nNew York Guard personnel are eligible to receive both New York State and New York Guard awards and decorations. The New York Guard issues several awards.\n\nNew York Guard (NYG) awards:\n\nDescriptions of New York State awards and decorations can be found at the New York State Division of Military and Naval Affairs website: dmna.ny.gov.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2212613", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2212613", "title": "Airport Core Programme", "text": "Airport Core Programme\n\nThe Airport Core Programme (ACP) was a series of infrastructure projects centred on the new Hong Kong International Airport during the early 1990s. The programme was part of the Port and Airport Development Strategy, commonly known as the Rose Garden Project.\n\nThe cost for the whole project was estimated at over HK$200 billion, and the Chinese Government was concerned about its impact on the financial reserve of the future Hong Kong SAR Government. Several changes were made to the plan, including the shortening of the Tsing Ma Bridge and the construction of the Airport Railway as a double-track railway. The project ended up costing HK$160.2 billion.\n\nThe Programme formally commenced after the signing of a memorandum of understanding between British Prime Minister John Major and Chinese Premier Li Peng in Beijing on 3 September 1991, and lasted eight years in total. It was the most expensive airport project in the world, according to the Guinness World Records. It was the biggest infrastructure programme in Hong Kong's history.\n\nPlans to replace the old Kai Tak Airport were drafted after the Second World War. However, for financial and political reasons, the plan was abandoned in 1951 and the Hong Kong Government decided to expand the original airport instead.\n\nWith the growth of the economy of Hong Kong during the 1970s, the project reemerged for discussion. The government earmarked Chek Lap Kok, just off the north coast of Lantau Island near Tung Chung, as the designated site for the new airport. However, the plan was shelved in 1983 for economic reasons, as well as the question of Hong Kong's sovereignty and the impending signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration.\n\nThe plan was announced on 11October 1989 by the then Governor David Wilson, and it was perceived to be part of the government's effort to reinstate confidence in Hong Kong after the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. The public was initially surprised by the huge budget and there were concerns that it would drain much of the public revenue. The programme was completed with the opening of the new Hong Kong International Airport at Chek Lap Kok in July 1998.\n\nThe programme included:\n\nThe Hong Kong International Airport is the centrepiece of this massive project; it provided the foundation for the other nine core projects of the Airport Core Programme.\n\nChek Lap Kok was selected as an optimal site due to its development potential. Construction finally started in 1992 and was planned to finish in mid-1997. Chris Patten, the last Governor of Hong Kong, expressed his hope of leaving Hong Kong via the new airport after the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong. Sadly, this did not materialise. The airport finally came into operation on 6 July 1998, at a cost of around US$20 billion.\n\nThe Airport Railway was built to connect Kowloon Peninsula and Hong Kong Island to the Airport and the planned new towns of Northern Lantau. The railway is operated by the MTR Corporation and has two routes: the Airport Express and the Tung Chung Line which provides a commuter service linking the new town of Tung Chung to the city. These two lines share the same double-tracks for most of their routes, however, the railway was initially planned to have four tracks along its length. The commuter service offered by the Tung Chung Line also provided relief to the overcrowded Tsuen Wan Line of the MTR.\n\nComprising Kap Shui Mun Bridge and Tsing Ma Bridge, the Lantau Link connects Lantau with Tsing Yi, via Ma Wan. It carries both road and railway traffic between the islands.\n\nThis is the third cross-harbour tunnel for Victoria Harbour. Built under a build-operate-transfer agreement with the Western Harbour Tunnel Company, the tunnel was intended to relieve congestion at the Cross Harbour Tunnel and is part of expressway Route 3.\n\nWith the highest posted speed limit in Hong Kong, this six-lane motorway links Tung Chung in the west to the Lantau Link in the east, via the north coast of Lantau.\n\nRoute 3 is one of the 10 strategic expressway routes of Hong Kong, linking Sai Ying Pun on Hong Kong Island and Yuen Long in the New Territories. The Kwai Chung and Tsing Yi sections were built to link the Lantau Link and West Kowloon Expressway.\n\nThe Kwai Chung section is 3 km in length. The route connects with the West Kowloon Highway near Lai Chi Kok, then bypasses the Kwai Tsing Container Terminals, finally connecting with the Cheung Tsing Bridge of the Tsing Yi section. It is an 8-lane elevated motorway. This section is now known as Tsing Kwai Highway.\n\nThe Tsing Yi section comprises the 500 m long Cheung Tsing Bridge, which crosses over Rambler Channel, and the 1.6 km Cheung Tsing Tunnel, which cuts through the high ground on Tsing Yi Island. This section is now known as the Cheung Tsing Highway.\n\nThis is a six-lane motorway 4.2 km in length with the northern 2 km elevated for the Airport Railway running underneath. It links the Kowloon portal of the Western Harbour Crossing in the south to the Tsing Kwai Highway in the north and is built entirely on newly reclaimed land.\n\nReclamation work was needed along the west coast of Kowloon Peninsula to provide land for the expressway, Route 3, as well as supporting infrastructure. The Airport Railway also runs through the reclaimed land of West Kowloon. The reclamation work has increased the area of Kowloon Peninsula by 30%.\n\nThis phase required the reclamation of an area of 20 hectares along the waterfront of Central to provide land for the Airport Railway's Hong Kong Station. Two ferry piers serving outlying islands as well as a government dockyard had to be relocated to facilitate the work.\n\nThe first phase of the new town in Northern Lantau is centred on Tung Chung and was planned to provide housing to 18,000 people. The new town was meant to be a supporting community for the new Hong Kong International Airport, as well as to act as a \"gateway\" to Hong Kong for visitors.

{"id": "2212619", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2212619", "title": "Sinker (baseball)", "text": "Sinker (baseball)\n\nIn baseball, a sinker or sinking fastball is a type of fastball which has significant downward and horizontal movement and is known for inducing ground balls. Pitchers who use the sinker tend to rely on it heavily and do not need to change pitch speeds as much as other pitchers do because the sinking action induces weak bat contact. Other pitchers normally change pitch speeds to achieve this effect. The sinker is much more often used by right-handed than left-handed pitchers.\n\nBefore the 1950s, pitchers did not know what caused their pitches to sink or \"hop.\" They regarded either ability as a \"gift from heaven.\" Bill James cites Curt Simmons as the first pitcher to be able to throw both sinkers and rising fastballs, apparently indicating that it was not known how to make a pitch sink and how to make one hop.\n\nZach Britton, Marcus Stroman, Charlie Morton, Dallas Keuchel, Jake Arrieta, Jim Johnson, Rick Porcello, Kendall Graveman, Sonny Gray, Jeurys Familia, Tanner Roark, Jordan Hicks, Sam Dyson, Scott Alexander, Dustin May, Matt Albers, Mike Soroka, and Mike Leake are current major league players who rely heavily on the sinker.\n\nOne method of throwing the sinker is to simply grip the baseball along the two seams and throw it similar to a fastball. Some pitchers use a downward motion on their wrist when throwing it. The pitcher's palm turns to the right at release for a right handed pitcher. This causes a sharper sink, but also has a greater risk of a wild pitch. This wrist movement is also called pronation.\n\nMany sinker ball pitchers today turn the inside of the ball over just before releasing the ball, combined with slightly increasing the pressure on the ball with the index finger (\"press inside\") which creates a tilted sidespin motion that causes horizontal movement.\n\nThe sinker drops 6 to 9 inches more than a typical four seam fastball which causes batters to hit ground balls more often than other fastballs, mostly due to the tilted sidespin on the ball. Horizontal movement also occurs when sinkers are thrown. Sinkerball pitchers can often get called strikes and swinging strikes on the pitch.\n\n"}
{"id": "2212621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2212621", "title": "Fishing sinker", "text": "Fishing sinker\n\nA fishing sinker or knoch is a weight used in conjunction with a fishing lure or hook to increase its rate of sink, anchoring ability, and/or casting distance. Fishing sinkers may be as small as 1 gram for applications in shallow water, and even smaller for fly fishing applications, or as large as several pounds or considerably more for deep sea fishing. They are formed into nearly innumerable shapes for diverse fishing applications. Environmental concerns surround the usage of lead and other materials in fishing sinkers.\n\nA large variety of sinkers exist which are used depending on the fish being pursued, the environment, the current and personal preference.\n\nPyramid sinkers are shaped like a pyramid and are used when it is desirable to anchor on the bottom of water bodies. They are attached to the terminal end of fishing line by loops of brass.\n\nBarrel or egg sinkers are rounded and often bead-like with a narrow hole through which fishing line is threaded. These sinkers are desirable on rock or debris covered substrates.\n\nSplit-shot sinkers are small and round with a split cutting halfway through the sinker. The split can be placed on a piece of fishing line and then crimped closed. This feature makes adding and removing the weights easy and quick.\n\nBullet sinkers are bullet-shaped and used widely on largemouth bass fishing for rigging plastic worms \"Texas-style\".\n\nDipsey sinkers are ovate or egg-shaped and are attached to the fishing line with a loop of brass wire embedded in the sinker.\n\nBank sinkers are long and ovate and have a small hole at the top for the fishing line to thread through.\n\nA claw sinker consists of a sinker weight which is typically of round shape, and a number of metal wire spikes grouped around the sinker weight acting as barbs. Claw sinkers are used in surf fishing on sandy bottoms with strong currents, mainly to prevent the sinker from getting carried off with the current. Upon casting a claw sinker, the line is briefly tugged so that the claws will dig themselves into the sand, allowing the rig to stay in place.\n\nA Deep Drop Weight is used to reach the bottom in deeper offshore fishing applications. These fishing weights are typically cylindrical in with a brass eyelet at the top for attaching to a rig. Weights for this style of sinker range from one pound to as much as fourteen pounds. Target species include Tilefish, Grouper, and Swordfish, among others.\n\nAn ideal material for a fishing sinker is environmentally acceptable, cheap and dense. Density is desirable as weights must be as small as possible, in order to minimize visual cues which could drive fish away from a fishing operation.\n\nIn ancient times as well as sometimes today, fishing sinkers consisted of materials found ordinarily in the natural environment, such as stones, rocks, or bone. Later, lead became the material of choice for sinkers due to its low cost, ease of production and casting, chemical inertness (resistance to corrosion), and density. However, lead is known to cause lead poisoning and enter the environment as a result of the inevitable occasional loss of fishing sinkers during routine fishing. Thus, most lead-based fishing sinkers have been outlawed in the United Kingdom (under 1 oz weight), Canada, and some states in the United States. Lead based fishing sinkers are banned in all of US and Canadian National Parks. These bans have motivated the use of various other materials in sinkers. \n\nSteel, brass, and bismuth sinkers have been marketed, but anglers have not widely adopted them due to their lower density and higher cost compared to lead. Sandsinkers have also been developed, using sand as weight. However, sand has a comparably low density to that of lead and makes a poor replacement.\nTungsten is now in use, especially among largemouth bass anglers. Although several times costlier than lead, tungsten is just under twice as dense as lead and thus found desirable. The environmental effects of tungsten, however, are essentially unknown.\n\nMore recently, terminal tackle manufacturers are experimenting with high density composite resins. These materials present a non-toxic alternative to lead sinkers at a lower monetary cost than alternative metallic sinkers.\n\n"}

The community uses many of the facilities at nearby Pipalyatjara.\n\nKalka is situated in the far northwest of South Australia, right alongside the Gunbarrel Highway. The Kalka community is just kilometres from the Surveyor-General's Corner (the intersection of the South Australia, Western Australia and Northern Territory borders). The community of Pipalyatjara is situated 15 kilometres away by road, on the south side of the mountain ridge of which Kalka sits on the north. Kalka is situated at the foot of the Tomkinson Ranges.\n\nBased upon the climate records of the Giles Weather Station which is across the border and slightly to the northwest in Western Australia, Kalka experiences summer maximum temperatures of an average of 37.2 degrees Celsius in January and a winter maximum average temperature of 19.9 degrees Celsius in July. Overnight lows range from a mean minimum temperature of 23.5 degrees in January to 6.8 degrees in June.\n\nAnnual rainfall averages 284.2 millimetres.\n\nAt the 2016 Australian census, Kalka had a population of 92. The median age was 25 years old.\n\n15 years earlier, the 2001 Australian Census indicated a total population of 139, with 90.6% being Indigenous Australians.\n\nPY Media reports:\n\nKalka Community is the administrative and residential centre for Pitjantjatjara Homelands Council. PHC is an incorporated Aboriginal organisation that exists to further the social, economic, political and cultural interests of its members. PHC was born out of the Aboriginal homelands movement of the 1970s when Anangu left the missions and government settlements to the east and west and returned to their traditional country. Many Anangu had been brought into or were attracted into these settlements during the 1950s and 1960s when the Australian Government ran the Maralinga atomic bomb tests and Woomera rocket tests. Kalka was originally planned as a resource centre for surrounding homelands but by the early 1990s it had developed into a small Aboriginal community with the full range of housing, infrastructure and service needs.\n\nKalka Community has an unsealed airstrip. None of the roads within the community are sealed, though work to seal the roads was scheduled for completion by mid-2007.\n\nA fortnightly truck brings fresh, frozen and dry groceries and other freight to the community.\n\nThere is no school or health clinic at Kalka, both services of which are supplied from nearby Pipalyatjara.\n\nA Technical and Further Education (TAFE) facility provides education on running a store or office, computer and Internet use. The TAFE also assists students in getting their driver's licence.\n\nThe Kalka community also has a small community store (said to be the only Anangu-run store on the APY Lands), a craft facility, children's playground, basketball court, administrative office and mechanic garage.\n\nThe South Australian Department for Aboriginal Affairs and Reconciliation\n(DAARE) provide many essential services.\n\nEssential services support comes via Pipalyatjara.\n\nKalka does not have a permanent police presence. South Australian police are based at Marla and run patrols in the area. Unlike other communities on the APY Lands, no community constable is based at Kalka.\n\nA mobile polling booth visits nearby Pipalyatjara for elections every 4 years to elect the Parliament of South Australia.\n\nA permit is required for a member of the public to visit any community on the APY Lands, as they are freehold lands owned by the Aboriginal people.\n\n"}

{"id": "2212634", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2212634", "title": "Linux kernel interfaces", "text": "Linux kernel interfaces\n\nThe Linux kernel provides several interfaces to user-space applications that are used for different purposes and that have different properties by design. There are two types of application programming interface (API) in the Linux kernel that are not to be confused: the \"kernel–user space\" API and the \"kernel internal\" API.\n\nThe Linux API is the kernel–user space API, which allows programs in user space to access system resources and services of the Linux kernel. It is composed out of the System Call Interface of the Linux kernel and the subroutines in the GNU C Library (glibc). The focus of the development of the Linux API has been to provide the \"usable features\" of the specifications defined in POSIX in a way which is reasonably compatible, robust and performant, and to provide additional useful features not defined in POSIX, just as the kernel– user space APIs of other systems implementing the POSIX API also provide additional features not defined in POSIX.\n\nThe Linux API, by choice, has been kept stable over the decades and never breaks; this stability guarantees the portability of source code. At the same time, Linux kernel developers have historically been conservative and meticulous about introducing new system calls.\n\nMuch available free and open-source software is written for the POSIX API. Since so much more development flows into the Linux kernel as compared to the other POSIX-compliant combinations of kernel and C standard library, the Linux kernel and its API have been augmented with additional features. As far as these additional features provide a technical advantage, programming for the Linux API is preferred over the POSIX-API. Well-known current examples are udev, systemd and Weston. People such as Lennart Poettering openly advocate to prefer the Linux API over the POSIX API, where this offers advantages.\n\nAt FOSDEM 2016, Michael Kerrisk explained some of the perceived issues with the Linux kernel's user-space API, describing that it contains multiple design errors by being non-extensible, unmaintainable, overly complex, of limited purpose, in violation of standards, and inconsistent. Most of those mistakes cannot be fixed because doing so would break the ABI that the kernel presents to the user space.\n\n\"System Call Interface\" is the denomination for the entirety of all implemented and available system calls in a kernel. Various subsystems, such as e.g. the DRM define their own system calls and the entirety is called System Call Interface.\n\nVarious issues with the organization of the Linux kernel system calls are being publicly discussed. Issues have been pointed out by Andy Lutomirski, Michael Kerrisk and others.\n\nThe GNU C Library is a wrapper around the system calls of the Linux kernel; the combination of the Linux kernel System Call Interface and glibc is what builds the Linux API.\n\n\nAs in other Unix-like systems, additional capabilities of the Linux kernel exist that are not part of POSIX:\n\n\nDRM has been paramount for the development and implementations of well-defined and performant free and open-source graphics device drivers without which no rendering acceleration would be available at all, or even worse, only the 2D drivers would be available in the X.Org Server. DRM was developed for Linux, and since has been ported to other operating systems as well.\n\n\nThe term Linux ABI refers to a kernel–user space ABI. The Application binary interface refers to the compiled binaries, in machine code. Any such ABI is therefore bound to the instruction set. Defining a useful ABI and keeping it stable is less the responsibility of the Linux kernel developers or of the developers of the GNU C Library, and more the task for Linux distributions and Independent software vendor (ISVs) who wish to sell and provide support for their proprietary software as binaries only for such a single Linux ABI, as opposed to supporting multiple Linux ABIs.\n\nAn ABI has to be defined for every instruction set, such as x86, x86-64, MIPS, ARMv7-A (32-Bit), ARMv8-A (64-Bit), etc. with the endianness, if both are supported.\n\nIt should be able to compile the software with different compilers against the definitions specified in the ABI and achieve full binary compatibility. Compilers that are free and open-source software are e.g. GNU Compiler Collection, LLVM/Clang.\n\nEnd-users are in fact not all interested in the Linux API (or the Windows API), but in the ABIs.\n\nThere are a lot of kernel-internal APIs for all the subsystems to interface with one another. These are being kept fairly stable, but there is no guarantee for stability. In case new research or insights make a change seem favorable, an API is changed, all necessary rewrite and testing have to be done by the author.\n\nThe Linux kernel is a monolithic kernel, hence device drivers are kernel components. To ease the burden of companies maintaining their (proprietary) device drivers out-of-tree, stable APIs for the device drivers have been repeatedly requested. The Linux kernel developers have repeatedly denied guaranteeing stable in-kernel APIs for device drivers. Guaranteeing such would have faltered the development of the Linux kernel in the past and would still in the future and, due to the nature of free and open-source software, are not necessary. Ergo, by choice, the Linux kernel has no \"stable\" in-kernel API.\n\nSince there are no stable in-kernel APIs, there cannot be stable in-kernel ABIs.\n\nFor several use cases the Linux API is considered too low-level and higher abstraction APIs are used. Such of course still need to work on top of the low-level Linux APIs. Examples:\n\n\n\n"}

He was killed by the Israel Defense Forces in 1992.\n\nMoussawi was born into a Shia family in the village of Al-Nabi Shayth in the Beqaa Valley in Lebanon in around 1952. He spent eight years studying theology in a religious school in Najaf, Iraq, where he was deeply influenced by the views of Iranian Ruhollah Khomeini. Moussawi was a student, at the \"hawza\" in Najaf, of Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr, an influential Shi'a cleric, philosopher, political leader, and founder of the Da'wa Party of Iraq.\n\nAl-Moussawi returned to Lebanon in 1978. Along with Subhi al-Tufayli he spearheaded the formation of Hezbollah movement in the Beqaa Valley in 1982, one of the three major areas of Shia population in Lebanon. From 1983 to 1985 he is reported to have served as operational head of the Hezbollah Special Security Apparatus. From late 1985 until April 1988 he was head of Hezbollah's military wing, the Islamic Resistance.\n\nAccording to some reports (while others attribute the act to Subhi al-Tufayli), al Musawi was responsible for the abduction of Lt. Col William Higgins while commander of Hezbollah's Islamic Resistance, (military wing).\n\nIn 1991, Hezbollah had entered a new era with the end of both the Iran–Iraq War and Lebanese Civil War, the Taif Agreement and the release of the Kuwait 17 bombers. A new leader was thought to be needed to facilitate the release of the Western hostages held by Hezbollah and more importantly to shift Hezbollah's focus to resistance activity against Israel.\n\nAl Moussawi also promised to \"intensify [Hezbollah] military, political and popular action in order to undermine the peace-talks.\" He did not support entering mainstream politics. Unlike other Hezbollah figures, he advocated the acceptance of Taif Agreement, which was the rejection of theocratic state in Lebanon.\n\nOn 16 February 1992, Israeli Apache helicopters fired missiles at the motorcade of al Moussawi in southern Lebanon, killing al Moussawi, his wife, his five-year-old son, and four others. Israel said the attack had been planned as an assassination attempt in retaliation for the kidnapping and death of missing Israeli servicemen in 1986 and abduction of US Marine and UN peace-keeping officer William R. Higgins in 1988.\n\nIn retaliation, the Islamic Jihad Organization carried out the Israeli Embassy attack in Buenos Aires. After the attack, the Islamic Jihad Organization declared that it was carried out for the revenge of the martyr infant Hussein, al Musawi's five-year-old son, who had been killed with his father. Later it was revealed by Dieter Bednarz and Ronen Bergman that the original plan of Israel had been just to abduct al Musawi to realize the release of Israeli prisoners. However, Ehud Barak, then Israeli chief of staff, convinced then Israeli Prime Minister Shamir to order his assassination.\n\nAl Musawi was succeeded as Secretary General of Hezbollah by Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah.\n"}

{"id": "2212656", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2212656", "title": "Cinema of Denmark", "text": "Cinema of Denmark\n\nDenmark has been producing films since 1897 and since the 1980s has maintained a steady stream of product due largely to funding by the state-supported Danish Film Institute. Historically, Danish films have been noted for their realism, religious and moral themes, sexual frankness and technical innovation.\n\nThe Danish filmmaker Carl Theodor Dreyer (1889–1968) is considered one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema. Other Danish filmmakers of note include Benjamin Christensen, who outside his native country directed several horror classics including \"Häxan\" (1922) and \"Seven Footprints to Satan\" (1929); Erik Balling, the creator of the popular \"Olsen-banden\" films; Gabriel Axel, an Oscar-winner for \"Babette's Feast\" in 1987; and Bille August, the Oscar-, Palme d'Or- and Golden Globe-winner for \"Pelle the Conqueror\" in 1988. In the modern era, notable filmmakers in Denmark include Lars von Trier, who co-created the Dogme 95 film movement, and multiple award-winners Susanne Bier and Nicolas Winding Refn.\n\nDanish cinema pioneer Peter Elfelt, a photographer, was the first Dane to make a film. Between the years of 1896 and 1912, he produced around 200 documentary films on life in Denmark. His first film was \"Kørsel med Grønlandske Hunde\" (\"Traveling with Greenlandic Dogs\"). Furthermore, he produced the first Danish feature film: \"Henrettelsen\" (\"Capital Execution\", 1903). The first film show in Denmark took place in the Panorama cinema on the Town Hall square in Copenhagen, in June 1896. However, the selection of films had been made and produced abroad.\n\nIn 1906, cinema owner Ole Olsen founded the first Danish film-making company, Nordisk Films Kompagni. It gained most of its income from the export market of short films. Not until 1909 were other film-producing companies established. In 1910 the number had reached ten. This period is now known as the Golden Age of Danish Cinema. In the spring of 1910, Nordisk Films Kompagni changed its policy of producing only short films and began making feature films. This was largely inspired by the Århus Fotorama company's \"Den hvide Slavehandel\" (\"The White Slave Trade\", 1910), which was the first multi-reel Danish film lasting more than 30 minutes.\n\nWith the increasing length of films, there was a growing artistic awareness, which is evident in \"Afgrunden\" (\"The Abyss\", 1910). This film launched the career of Asta Nielsen, who soon became Europe's first great female film star. The film was an erotic melodrama, which soon became the preferred genre in early Danish cinema. In 1911, with director August Blom as the new head of production, Nordisk Film was the first of the major European companies to devote itself entirely to full-length feature films. These films were sold abroad profitably because the technical and photographic quality impressed audiences. Yet, when exporting the films, the erotic elements needed to be toned down in order not to offend the working class audiences. In 1913, Nordisk released the first full-length feature movie, \"Atlantis\" directed by Blom.\n\nAfter 1913, Danish cinema began to lose its leading foothold in the film industry, with foreign companies having intensified competition in the production of feature-length films. Danish cinema had also begun to suffer from a lack of imagination and a willingness to take creative risks on the part of Danish producers. Independent producer Benjamin Christensen had great success with the spy film \"Det hemmelighedsfulde X\" (\"The Mysterious X\" or \"Sealed Orders\", 1914) and the crime drama \"Hævnens Nat\" (\"Blind Justice\" or \"The Night of Revenge\", 1916), both of which are major works in the history of the Danish cinema; he would later direct several films in Sweden and Hollywood.\n\nDuring World War I, the USA became the leading nation in film production and Danish exports decreased. In the years following the war, Dreyer made an appearance as director at Nordisk Film with the drama \"Præsidenten\" (\"The President\", 1919), followed by the ambitious \"Blade af Satans Bog\" (\"Leaves from Satan's Book\", 1921), inspired by the American director D. W. Griffith's \"Intolerance\" (1916) in both technique and theme. However, Dreyer, as well as Benjamin Christensen, were not permanently connected to the influential Danish film industries and remained loners. As a whole, Danish film in the 1920s was on the decline in spite of the filmmakers' better technical skills. Of most interest at this time were perhaps the so-called Dickens movies directed by the very able A. W. Sandberg. At one point Denmark again enjoyed some international reputation, by the many farces of the vagabond duo Fyrtaarnet og Bivognen (often known by their French names Doublepatte and Patachon), who were Scandinavian predecessors of Laurel and Hardy. They were introduced by Palladium, the rival of Nordisk Film. Despite these resurgences, at the end of the decade the Danish film industry was on its heels.\n\nIn 1929, Nordisk Film Kompagni was established as a sound film company. \"The Pastor of Vejlby\" (1931) reinforced the Nordisk's dominance in the Danish market. The 1930s were dominated by many successes with light comedies. The so-called \"folkekomedie\" (folk comedy) genre was born, with \"Barken Margrethe\" (1934) an important early example. The Depression and the economic conditions of the film companies prevented more serious film business, and the victory of the sound movie automatically set greater limits on the international possibilities of Danish film. Many popular stars like Marguerite Viby, Ib Schønberg and Peter Malberg had breakthroughs but in spite of many economic successes no further development of the media was seen.\n\nBetween 1940 and 1945, the German occupation of Denmark during World War II pushed the film industry toward more serious subject matter. The darker tone during these years paralleled the rise of film noir in Hollywood. Bodil Ipsen made her directorial mark with 1942's \"Afsporet\", the first Danish film noir, and continued with the psychological thriller \"Melody of Murder\" (1944). The standard of the comedy was also lifted, especially by the witty, elegant movies of Johan Jacobsen, a Danish pupil of Ernst Lubitsch. After the war ended, there was a movement toward realism and social criticism, particularly noted in films directed by Ole Palsbo. Soon, however, Denmark's film industry returned to making the light sentimental comedies and uncomplicated regionalist movies that were popular with Danish filmgoers.\n\nA large stream of family comedies (\"Lystspil\") and class-conscious folk comedies (\"folkekomedier\") were produced from the 1950s to late 1970s/early 1980s. Here a lot of Danish stars were born, such as Dirch Passer, Ove Sprogøe and director Erik Balling. Important films of this period include \"De røde heste\" (1950), \"Far til fire\" (1953), \"Kispus\" (1956, first Danish film in colour), \"Støv på hjernen\" (1961), \"Sommer i Tyrol\" (1964), \"Passer passer piger\" (1965), the \"Olsen-banden\"-series (1968-1981) and Erik Balling's classic TV-sitcom \"Huset på Christianshavn\" (1970-1977).\n\nIn the sixties, Danish cinema became gradually more erotic, with films such as \"\" (Erik Balling, 1965), \"Sytten\" (Annelise Meinecke, 1965), \"Jeg - en kvinde\" (Mac Ahlberg, 1965) and \"Uden en trævl\" (Annelise Meinecke, 1968), several of which made a huge international impression. As a natural progression, in 1969 Denmark became the first country to completely legalize pornography. In the 1970s, a large percentage of all Danish films were sexually oriented, and many mainstream-features with mainstream-actors included sequences with either softcore- or hardcore-pornography, most notably \"Mazurka på sengekanten\" (John Hilbard, 1970) and \"I Jomfruens tegn\" (Finn Karlsson, 1973) along with their many respective sequels, forming the eight \"Bedside\"-films and six \"Zodiac\"-films.\n\nIn 1972, the Danish Film Institute (DFI) was founded to provide state subsidies for hand-picked films. It allocated public funding for feature films based on their artistic merit rather than commercial appeal—with an emphasis on those films which expressed Danish culture and identity. The DFI reinvigorated the financial viability of the sagging Danish film industry, but later was criticized for becoming too conservative and nationalistic in defining which films represented Danish identity. In one example, Lars von Trier's 1984 debut feature \"The Element of Crime\" struggled to receive funds because it was radically different from the typical Danish film—and, yet, received international acclaim upon release. In response, the Ministry of Culture in 1989 vastly broadened the DFI's definition of \"Danish film\" to include any work which contributed to Danish film culture. This allowed state funding of films with greater global appeal and helped foster the international success of a new wave of Danish filmmakers.\n\nWith \"La' os være\" (Ernst Johansen & Lasse Nielsen, 1975), independent producer Steen Herdel launched a wave of successful teenage-dramas, including \"Måske ku' vi\" (Morten Arnfred, 1976), \"Du er ikke alene\" (\"You Are Not Alone\") (Ernst Johansen & Lasse Nielsen, 1978), \"Mig og Charly\" (Morten Arnfred & Henning Kristiansen, 1978) and \"Vil du se min smukke navle?\" (Søren Kragh-Jacobsen, 1978), all produced by Steen Herdel.\n\nA notable TV-series, \"Matador\", ran from 1978-1982, and has remained a national favourite. It was directed by Erik Balling.\n\nSince the start of the 1980s, the Danish film industry has been completely dependent on state funding through Det Danske Filminstitut. A project usually does not get made unless the script, director and cast etc. has been approved by the appointed representatives of the Danish Film Institute. This means that Danish filmmaking is essentially controlled by the state.\n\nIn 1983, Lars von Trier graduated from Den Danske Filmskole (National Film School of Denmark) and received international attention with films such as \"Forbrydelsens element\" (1984) and \"Epidemic\" (1987). His strange, innovative ideas were fiercely resisted by Det Danske Filminstitut and drew very small local audiences, but were embraced by the Cannes Film Festival, where his films were included in the official selections and took home awards.\n\nReleased in 1987 was the gay teenage drama \"Venner for altid\" (\"Friends Forever\"), directed by Stefan Henszelman (1960-1991). It won the 1988 \"Audience Award\" as Best Feature at the San Francisco International Lesbian & Gay Film Festival.\n\nThe Danish film industry got a major boost in the late 1980s when the movie \"Babettes Gæstebud\" (Babette's Feast), directed by Gabriel Axel, won an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 1987, and next year the Best Foreign Film award went to \"Pelle Erobreren\" (Pelle the Conqueror), directed by Bille August.\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, more talented directors started graduating from the National Film School of Denmark, such as Thomas Vinterberg, Per Fly and Ole Christian Madsen.\n\nAlso in the late 1980s, Danish cinematographer Mikael Salomon ended a long career in Danish cinema to become one of Hollywood's most celebrated DPs, later establishing himself as a successful, Emmy Award-winning television director.\n\nDanish film in the 1990s was dominated by Lars von Trier. His films \"Europa\", \"Breaking the Waves\", \"The Idiots\", and \"Dancer in the Dark\" received great international attention and were nominated for numerous awards.\n\nThe Dogme 95 Collective caught the attention of the international film world with its strict \"vows of chastity\" or rules for filmmakers that force filmmakers to concentrate on purity of story and the actors' performances rather than special effects and other cinematic devices.\n\nThe first Dogme 95 film, \"The Celebration\" (\"Festen\"), directed by Thomas Vinterberg, received many awards on the international film festival circuit and was named by both the Los Angeles Film Critics Association and the New York Film Critics Circle as the best foreign-language film of the year.\n\nThe members of the Dogme 95 Collective were von Trier, Vinterberg, Kristian Levring, and Søren Kragh-Jacobsen. Although the Dogme 95 movement originated in Denmark, filmmakers around the world soon experimented with the rigid guidelines and sought certification for their films as Dogme. Furthermore, Lars von Trier's own Dogme-film \"Idioterne\" (1998) started a separate wave of arthouse mainstream films with unsimulated sex.\n\nLars von Trier also made history by having his company Zentropa be the world's first mainstream film company to produce hardcore pornographic films. Three of these films, \"Constance\" (1998), \"Pink Prison\" (1999) and the adult/mainstream crossover-feature \"All About Anna\" (2005), were made primarily for a female audience, and were extremely successful in Europe, with the two first being directly responsible for the March 2006 legalizing of pornography in Norway.\n\nA trilogy directed by Per Fly, \"The Bench\" (Bænken) (2000), \"Inheritance\" (Arven) (2003), and \"Manslaughter\" (Drabet) (2005) portrayed Denmark's three distinct social classes and received international acclaim.\nThe work of Susanne Bier, particularly \"Brothers\" (2004) and \"After the Wedding\" (2006), introduced the world to Danish actors such as Mads Mikkelsen, Ulrich Thomsen, and Nikolaj Lie Kaas. \"After the Wedding\" was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Bier's \"In a Better World\" (, meaning \"The Revenge\") is a 2010 drama starring Mikael Persbrandt, Trine Dyrholm and Ulrich Thomsen in a story which takes place in small-town Denmark and a refugee camp in Sudan. The film won the 2011 Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film and the Best Foreign Language Film at the 83rd Academy Awards.\n\nAnders Thomas Jensen first received acclaim as Oscar-winning writer-director of three short films, \"Ernst & lyset\" (1996), \"Wolfgang\" (1997) and \"Valgaften\" (1998), then as screenwriter of such feature films as \"Mifune's Last Song\" (1999), \"Open Hearts\" (2002), \"Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself\" (2002), \"Stealing Rembrandt\" (2003) and \"Brothers\" (2004); and finally as a director of dark and profound feature comedies like \"The Green Butchers\" (2003) and \"Adam's Apples\" (2005).\n\nOther notable Danish directors of the 21st century include Nikolaj Arcel, Christoffer Boe, Lone Scherfig, Niels Arden Oplev, Nicolas Winding Refn, Ole Christian Madsen, Annette K. Olesen and Christian E. Christiansen for executive producer by \"Patriots Day\" was shot in Paris, France only in the film.\n\nThe 21st century's first decade proved difficult for a number of Denmark's most established directors, including Lars von Trier, although things started well with his Nicole Kidman-starring \"Dogville\" (2003), a provocative stylistic experiment filmed on a black sound stage with little beyond white floor markings to indicate the sets. Its sequel \"Manderlay\" (2005), exploring the issue of slavery, continued this stylistic device but was largely ignored by audiences.\n\nThomas Vinterberg, who had gained worldwide recognition with \"The Celebration\" (1998), made two very expensive English-language flops, \"It's All About Love\" (2003) and \"Dear Wendy\" (2005), then tried to retrace his roots with a smaller Danish-language production, \"En mand kommer hjem\" (2007), which also flopped painfully, selling only 28.472 tickets.\n\nAround the same time, Bille August, Lone Scherfig, and Lars von Trier also made Danish-language films that flopped both financially and with the critics, leading the Danish financial times \"Børsen\" to observe on September 19, 2007 that \"1990'ernes filmfest er forbi\" (the film party of the 1990s has ended).\n\nA change of leadership at the Danish Film Institute in late 2007 was seen by many as an opportunity for reflection and renewal, while others pointed to the generally healthy local box office numbers and denied any crisis. Daily paper Jyllands-posten concluded the situation to be a \"krise i en opgangstid\" (crisis in a time of growth).\n\nIn 2008, Danish films sold over 4 million tickets at the Danish boxoffice, the biggest number since 1981, but the relief was brief, as Danish films in the first five months of 2009 turned out to have the lowest ticket-sales since 2005. Film critic Henrik Queitsch agreed that there was some reason for concern, noting in the Danish Film Institute's monthly program that \"the different, the surprising, the odd and the daring\" was hardly what characterised Danish films of 2008.\n\nDanish cinema nonetheless remains highly respected internationally, and Danish films (today almost exclusively consisting of social realist dramas, social realist comedies, children's films and documentaries) receive many awards at major international film festivals.\n\nDanish filmmaking remains influenced by the state through the Danish Film Institute (DFI), which was founded in 1972. DFI is Denmark's national agency for film and cinema culture, operating under the Ministry of Culture. DFI supports the development, production and distribution of films and run the national archives.\n\nSupport programmes also extend to international co-productions film education and international promotion at film festivals. The DFI includes a library, a stills and posters archive and a film archive. The DFI Film House is open to the public and houses the national Cinematheque.\n\nThe DFI supports the production of 20-25 feature films and 25-30 documentary and short films every year. There are three kinds of support: the film commissioner scheme, the market scheme and the talent development scheme at New Danish Screen.\n\nThe DFI encourages international partnerships and allows for 5-9 minor co-productions in feature film and 4-6 minor co-productions in documentary film per year.\n\nA cornerstone of Danish film policy is to fund children and youth films to which 25 percent of all subsidies are allocated.\n\nDFI has received criticism for lack of innovation (notably, Dogme 95 happened in spite of funding from the Film Institute) and is sometimes accused of nepotism and cronyism, for example when film commissioner Mikael Olsen from 1998 to 1999 greenlighted 28 million kroner of subsidy money to his childhood-friend Peter Aalbæk Jensen, then went on to work for him in a high-ranking position.\n\nThe Danish Film Institute however has also achieved a high level of professionalism even if more or less reserved for a few selected genres and production companies (mainly Nordisk Film, Zentropa and Nimbus Film). In February 2008, Nordisk Film bought half of Zentropa, which frequently coproduces with Nimbus Film, but such tax-funded, state-sanctioned monopolies are rarely frowned upon in Denmark.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 30 January 2010 in Los Angeles, Mads Brügger's \"The Red Chapel,\" (Danish: \"Det Røde Kapel\") won the grand jury prize for the best world documentary at the Sundance Film Festival. Presenting a comic approach to a group's visit to North Korea, the film explores the development of an enigmatic and totalitarian country.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2212664", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2212664", "title": "Brian's Song", "text": "Brian's Song\n\nBrian's Song is a 1971 ABC Movie of the Week that recounts the details of the life of Brian Piccolo (played by James Caan), a Chicago Bears football player stricken with terminal cancer after turning pro in 1965, told through his friendship with Bears teammate Gale Sayers (Billy Dee Williams). Piccolo's and Sayers's sharply differing temperaments and racial backgrounds made them unlikely to become as close friends as they did, including becoming the first interracial roommates in the history of the National Football League, and the film chronicles the evolution of their friendship, ending with Piccolo's death in 1970. The production was such a success on ABC that it was later shown in theaters by Columbia Pictures, with a major premiere in Chicago; however, it was soon withdrawn for lack of business. Critics have called the movie one of the finest telefilms ever made. A 2005 readers poll taken by \"Entertainment Weekly\" ranked \"Brian's Song\" seventh in its list of the top \"guy-cry\" films ever made.\n\nThe movie is based on Sayers's account of his friendship with Piccolo and coping with Piccolo's illness in Sayers's 1970 autobiography, \"I Am Third\". The film was written by veteran screenwriter William Blinn, whose script one Dallas television critic called \"highly restrained, steering clear of any overt sentimentality [yet conveying] the genuine affection the two men felt so deeply for each other.\"\n\nAlthough based on a true story, the film does include some fictional scenes. For example, the head coach, George Halas (played by Jack Warden), tells Sayers that he wants to bench Piccolo when he suspects that there may be a problem affecting his performance. He later learns of Brian's cancer. In reality, Jim Dooley was the head coach at that time, as Halas had retired from the position following the 1967 season.\n\nThe movie begins as Chicago Bears rookie running back Gale Sayers (Williams) arrives at team practice as an errant punt is sent to Sayers. Fellow rookie running back Brian Piccolo (Caan) goes to retrieve the ball, and Sayers flips it to him. Before Sayers meets with coach George Halas (Jack Warden) in his office, Piccolo tells him – as a prank – that Halas has a hearing problem, and Sayers acts strangely at the meeting. Sayers pranks him back by placing mashed potatoes on his seat while Piccolo is singing his alma mater's fight song.\n\nDuring practice, Piccolo struggles while Sayers shines. Sayers and Piccolo are placed as roommates, a rarity during the racial strife at the time. When they are placed together Brian is scared he didn't make the team, and Gale makes a great point saying \"if you didn't make the team, we wouldn't be placed together as roommates.\" Their friendship flourishes, in football and in life, quickly extending to their wives, Joy Piccolo and Linda Sayers. Sayers quickly becomes a standout player, but he injures his knee in a game against the San Francisco 49ers. To aid in Sayers's recovery, Piccolo brings a weight machine to his house. In Sayers' place, Piccolo rushes for 160 yards in a 17–16 win over the Los Angeles Rams and is given the game ball. Piccolo challenges Sayers to a race across the park, where Sayers stumbles but wins. Piccolo wins the starting fullback position, meaning both he and Sayers will now be on the field together, and both excel in their roles.\n\nPiccolo starts to lose weight and his performance declines, so he is sent to a hospital for a diagnosis. Soon after, Halas tells Sayers that Piccolo has cancer and will have part of a lung removed. In an emotional speech to his teammates, Sayers states that they will win the game for Piccolo and give him the game ball. When the players later visit the hospital, Piccolo teases them about losing the game, laughing that the line in the old movie wasn’t \"let’s blow one for the Gipper.\"\n\nAfter a game against the St. Louis Cardinals, Sayers visits Joy, who reveals that Piccolo has to have another surgery for his tumor. After he is awarded the \"George S. Halas Most Courageous Player Award\", Sayers dedicates his award to Piccolo, telling the crowd that they had selected the wrong person for the prize and saying, \"I love Brian Piccolo, and I'd like all of you to love him, too. And tonight, when you hit your knees, please ask God to love him.\" In a call, Sayers mentions that he gave Piccolo a pint of blood while he was in critical condition. Piccolo dies with his wife by his side. The movie ends with a flashback of Piccolo and Sayers running through the park, while the narrator says that Piccolo died at age 26 and is remembered not for how he died but for how he lived.\n\n\nThe musical theme to \"Brian's Song\", \"The Hands of Time\", was a popular tune during the early 1970s and has become a standard. The music for the film was by Michel Legrand, with lyrics to the song by Marilyn and Alan Bergman.\n\nLegrand's instrumental version of the theme song charted for eight weeks in 1972, peaking at No. 56 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. It also won the Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition.\n\nThe film received acclaim and is often cited as one of the greatest television films ever made, as well as one of the greatest sports films.\n\nThe film was the most watched movie on U.S. television during 1971 and the most watched made-for-TV movie ever with a Nielsen rating of 32.9 and an audience share of 48% until it was surpassed by \"The Night Stalker\" in January 1972.\n\nIt holds a 92% \"Fresh\" score on Rotten Tomatoes based on 12 critics, with a consensus stating \"Buoyed by standout performances from James Caan and Billy Dee Williams, \"Brian's Song\" is a touching tale of friendship whose central relationship transcendeds its standard sports movie moments.\"\n\nTelevision critic Matt Zoller Seitz in his 2016 book co-written with Alan Sepinwall titled \"\" named \"Brian's Song\" as the fifth greatest American TV-movie of all time, stating that the film was \"The dramatic and emotional template for a good number of sports films and male weepies (categories which tend to overlap a bit)\", as well as \"an influential early example of the interracial buddy movie.\"\n\nThe film won an Emmy Award for Best Dramatic Program (1971–72). William Blinn won an Emmy for his teleplay, and Jack Warden won for his performance as Coach Halas. Caan and Williams were both nominated for best leading actor.\n\nThirty years after its original airing, a remake was aired in 2001 on ABC's \"The Wonderful World of Disney\" starring Mekhi Phifer as Sayers and Sean Maher as Piccolo.\n\n"}

They became interested in tennis after immigrating to the United States. They imported the patent leather tennis shoes from the Swiss Kuenzli shoe manufacturer, re-naming their company K-Swiss (K is for Künzli).\n\nIn the 1990s, Steven Nichols boosted K-Swiss's marketing budget, and hired a number of key individuals from large companies, such as Procter and Gamble, and began a marketing blitz around the K-Swiss brand. Award-winning Creative Director Mindy Gale led her NY based agency team in developing and producing K-Swiss advertising and publicity campaigns from 1997 through 2008. The \"I Wear My K-Swiss\" multi-media campaign ran for five consecutive years, targeting young urban consumers in print and on TV.\n\nA re-branding campaign appealing to a wider modern female target, featuring Anna Kournikova rolled out in 2007. Advertising campaigns encouraged users to personalize the trademark stripes under the slogan \"Put Your Spin on It.\" The brand includes their color changing K-Swiss Tongue Twister in 2003, the Stripe Shifter, and more recently their Band Em footwear styles.\n\nK-Swiss purchased the majority stake of Australian brand Royal Elastics in 2001. In 2003, they acquired 100% ownership of the company; in 2008, it was sold to a Taiwanese businessman, Eric Ma, who then went bankrupt in 2014, and refused to pay the rest contracted money, but transferred the brand's ownership to his mother.\n\nIn July 2011, a video was released wherein Kenny Powers purchased 51% of K-Swiss stock.\n\nIn January 2013, Kenny Powers was lubing the deals because the company — which posted $195 million in losses between 2009 and 2012 — was sold to Korean firm E-Land World Limited for $170 million. The following May, E-Land named a new executive team to oversee the newly formed K-Swiss Inc., including Truman Kim as chairman and Larry Remington as president and CEO.\n\nOn June 1, 2015, K-Swiss acquired Supra Footwear.\n\nIn September 2014, the company updated its brand identity. Keeping the K-Swiss name it unveiled a new marque. The new identity was created by a recently appointed internal creative team and plays up the company’s heritage as an American tennis brand. All aspects of the new brand’s design, including its 1966 typeface and tennis court colour palette, hark back to this identity. The company has been sponsoring events that appeal to their market as well as events which are likely to shape buying attitudes and help generate a positive reaction. One example is the sponsorship of Ireland's first sneaker convention run by Dub City Sneakz in Dún Laoghaire which K-Swiss sponsored.\n\nIn 2016, K-Swiss president Barney Waters made it the brand's mission to \"make sneakers for entrepreneurs.\" The brand furthered this marketing angle by launching a collaboration with entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk in 2017. The company has since launched campaigns with other entrepreneurs, including Karen Civil, Ben Baller, and Natalie Ellis.\n\nIn 2019, K-Swiss debuted a shoe collaboration with TV series Breaking Bad.\n\n"}

The popular myth is that the two industrialists, with no formal aerodynamics training, set about designing a single-seat aircraft with some spare plywood and a small engine, a Poinsard 25hp 2-cyl. The result was the 1948 D9 Bébé (Baby) model. In fact, the two had much experience of building and designing aircraft, Delemontez being a trained aeronautical engineer, and Joly having built an aircraft before the war.\n\nThe French government bought many of the aircraft, with more than 500 D9s being built during the next twenty years. Subsequently, the government expressed interest in a larger aircraft as a trainer and the two-seat D11 model followed in 1950.\n\nJodel aircraft are all-wood, usually made from Sitka spruce and plywood made out of okoume (also known as gaboon), a kind of West African hardwood. Most of the designs are recognisable by their distinctive wings, which have ‘cranked’ dihedral only on the outer third. The wings also incorporate washout, retaining aileron effectiveness at or just prior to the stall. From above or below, the wings are also distinctive as this cranked section of the wing tapers sharply towards the wingtip.\n\nThe design is popular in France and in Southern Europe, but the type is little known elsewhere. In Australia, the design has been brought up to date somewhat by Frank Rogers who produced new drawings to standards suited to Australian amateur builders.\n\nApart from prototypes, Jodels were made by a variety of French aviation manufacturers, but all construction ceased during the 1960s. Since that time, the Jodel company only sells licences to build its models and detailed plans to amateur builders of homebuilt aircraft.\n\nThe Jodel designs were later licensed to the following companies which produced derivative designs that retained the Jodel wing:\n\nThe first model was built in 1948. All Jodel planes have been low-wing monoplanes.\n\n"}

She was built by Harland & Wolff (Belfast, Northern Ireland); her keel was laid down on 30 May 1934. She was launched on 15 October 1935, and commissioned 13 November 1936. She was torpedoed and sunk by a German U-boat near Naples with great loss of life on 18 February 1944. On wartime service with Force K, she was holed so many times by bomb fragments that she acquired the nickname \"HMS \"Pepperpot\"\".\n\nAt the outbreak of World War II \"Penelope\" was with the 3rd Cruiser Squadron in the Mediterranean, having arrived at Malta on 2 September 1939. \"Penelope\" and her sister ship were reallocated to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron in the Home Fleet and arrived at Portsmouth on 11 January 1940. On 3 February she left for the River Clyde en route to Rosyth, arrived on 7 February and operated with the 2nd Cruiser Squadron on convoy escort duties. In April and May 1940, she took part in the Norwegian Campaign.\n\nOn 11 April \"Penelope\" ran aground off Fleinvær while hunting German merchant ships entering the Vestfjord. Her boiler room was flooded and she was holed forward. The destroyer towed her to Skjelfjord where an advanced base had been improvised. Despite air attacks, temporary repairs were made and she was towed home a month later. She arrived at Greenock in Scotland on 16 May 1940 where additional temporary repairs were carried out, before proceeding on 19 August to the Tyne for permanent repairs.\n\nAfter repairs and trials were completed in August 1941, \"Penelope\" reappeared as 'a new ship from the water line down'. She returned to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron at Scapa Flow on 17 August 1941. On 9 September she left Greenock escorting the battleship to Rosyth. Later that month she was employed in patrolling the Iceland–Faroes passage to intercept enemy surface ships.\n\nOn 6 October 1941 \"Penelope\" left Hvalfjord, Iceland, with another battleship, , escorting the aircraft carrier for the successful Operation E. J., an air attack on German shipping between Glom Fjord and the head of West Fjord, Norway. The force returned to Scapa Flow on 10 October 1941.\n\n\"Penelope\" and her sister were then assigned to form the core of Force K based at Malta and departed Scapa on 12 October 1941, arriving in Malta on 21 October. On 8 November, both cruisers and their escorting destroyers sailed from Malta to intercept an Italian convoy of six destroyers and seven merchant ships sailing for Libya, which had been sighted by aircraft at 37°53'N – 16°36'E. During the ensuing Battle of the Duisburg Convoy on 9 November off Cape Spartivento, the British sank one enemy destroyer () and all of the merchant ships.\n\nOn 23 November, Force K sailed again to intercept another enemy convoy; next day they sank two more merchant ships west of Crete. Force K received the Prime Minister's congratulations on their fine work. On 1 December 1941, Force K sank the Italian merchant vessel \"Adriatico\", at 32°52'N – 2°30'E, the destroyer \"Alvise da Mosto\", and the tanker \"Iridio Mantovani\" at 33°45'N – 12°30'E. The First Sea Lord congratulated them on 3 December.\n\nOn 19 December, while operating off Tripoli, \"Penelope\" struck a mine but was not seriously damaged, although the cruiser and the destroyer were sunk by mines in the same action. \"Penelope\" was sent into the dockyard for repairs and returned to service at the beginning of January 1942. On 5 January, she left Malta with Force K, escorting the Special Service Vessel \"Glengyle\" to Alexandria (Operation ME9), returning on 27 January, escorting the supply ship \"Breconshire\".\nShe left Malta, again with \"Breconshire\" on 13 February 1942 and an eastbound convoy aided by six destroyers, Operation MG5, returning to Malta on 15 February, with the destroyers and . On 23 March, she left Malta with \"Legion\" for Operation MG1, a further convoy to Malta. \"Breconshire\" was hit and taken in tow by \"Penelope\" and was later safely secured to a buoy in Marsaxlokk harbour, the whole operation was under the charge of \"Penelope\"s commanding officer, Captain A. D. Nicholl, of whose work the Naval Officer In Command (NOIC), Malta expressed appreciation.\n\n\"Penelope\" was holed both forward and aft by near-misses during air attacks on Malta on 26 March. While in the island, she was docked and repaired at the Malta Dry Docks. Day after day she was attacked by German aircraft and the crew worked to fix a myriad of shrapnel holes, so many that she was nicknamed HMS \"Pepperpot\"; when these had been plugged with long pieces of wood, HMS \"Porcupine\". She sailed for Gibraltar on 8 April and on the next day was repeatedly attacked from the air. She arrived in Gibraltar on 10 April, with further damage from near-misses. Later that day she received a signal from Vice Admiral, Malta, \"True to your usual form. Congratulations\".\n\nThe damage was extensive and required several months at home after temporary repairs in Gibraltar. The ship was visited by the Duke of Gloucester on 11 April, who had originally laid down her keel plate. The duke also visited Captain Nicholl in hospital. The First Sea Lord congratulated the ship on her successful arrival in Gibraltar. The question of \"Penelope\"s repairs had been reconsidered, and it was decided to send her to the United States. She accordingly left Gibraltar on 10 May 1942, for the Navy Yard at New York via Bermuda, arriving on 19 May. She was under repair until September and arrived in Norfolk, Virginia on 15 September, proceeding, again via Bermuda, to Portsmouth, England, which she reached on 1 October 1942. The King, at an investiture at Buckingham Palace, decorated 21 officers and men from \"Penelope\" as \"Heroes of Malta\". Among their awards were two Distinguished Service Orders, a Distinguished Service Cross and two Distinguished Service Medals.\n\n\"Penelope\" arrived at Scapa Flow on 2 December and remained in home waters until the middle of January 1943. She left the Clyde on 17 January for Gibraltar, where she arrived on 22 January. She had been allocated to the 12th Cruiser Squadron, in which she operated with the Western Mediterranean Fleet under the flag of Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham during the follow-up of Operation Operation Torch, the landings in North Africa.\n\nOn 1 June 1943, \"Penelope\" and the destroyers and shelled the Italian island of Pantelleria. The force received enemy gunfire in return and \"Penelope\" was hit once but suffered little damage. On 8 June 1943, with the cruiser and other ships, she took part in a further heavy bombardment of the island. A demand for its surrender was refused. The same force left Malta on 10 June, to cover the assault (Operation Corkscrew), which resulted in the surrender of the island on 11 June 1943. On 11 and 12 June \"Penelope\" also took part in the attack on Lampedusa, which fell to the British forces on 12 June 1943.\n\nOn 10 July 1943, with \"Aurora\" and two destroyers, \"Penelope\" carried out a diversionary bombardment of Catania as part of the conquest of Sicily, (Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily). The flotilla then moved to Taormina where the railway station was shelled. On 11 July, \"Penelope\" left Malta with the 12th Cruiser Squadron as part of Force H to provide cover for the northern flank of the assault on Sicily. During the remainder of July and August, she took part in various other naval gunfire support and sweeps during the campaign for Sicily.\n\nOn 9 September 1943, \"Penelope\" was part of Force Q for Operation Avalanche, the allied landings at Salerno, Italy, during which she augmented the bombardment force. \"Penelope\" left the Salerno area on 26 September with \"Aurora\" and at the beginning of October was transferred to the Levant in view of a possible attack on the island of Kos in the Dodecanese. On 7 October, with the cruiser and other ships, she sank six enemy landing craft, one ammunition ship and an armed trawler off Stampalia. While the ships were retiring through the Scarpanto Straits south of Rhodes, they were attacked by 18 Ju 87 \"Stuka\" dive-bombers of I Gruppe Sturzkampfgeschwader 3 MEGARA. Although damaged by a bomb, \"Penelope\" was able to return to Alexandria at . On 19 November 1943 the ship moved to Haifa in connection with possible developments in the Lebanon situation. Towards the end of 1943, she was ordered to Gibraltar for Operation Stonewall, (anti-blockade-runner duties), in the Atlantic. On 27 December, the forces in this operation destroyed the German blockade-runner \"Alsterufer\" which was sunk by aircraft co-operating with Royal Navy ships. \"Penelope\" returned to Gibraltar on 30 December and took part in Operation Shingle, the amphibious assault on Anzio, Italy, providing gunfire support as part of Force X with on 22 January 1944. She also assisted in the bombardments in the Formia area during the later operations. She made eight shoots on 8 February.\n\nOn 18 February 1944, \"Penelope\", under the command of Captain G. D. Belben, was leaving Naples to return to the Anzio area when she was torpedoed at by the under the command of Horst-Arno Fenski. A torpedo struck her in the after engine room and was followed sixteen minutes later by another torpedo that hit in the after boiler room, causing her immediate sinking; 417 of the crew, including the captain, went down with the ship and 206 survived. A memorial plaque commemorating those lost is in St Ann's Church, HM Dockyard, Portsmouth.\n\nC. S. Forester, author of the Horatio Hornblower series of sea stories set at the time of the Napoleonic Wars, published his novel \"The Ship\" in May 1943. It is set in the war in the Mediterranean and follows a Royal Navy light cruiser in an action where it defeats a superior Italian force. The character and motivation of many of the men on board and the contributions they make are considered. The author dedicated the book \"with the deepest respect to the officers and crew of HMS \"Penelope\"\". The story of the fictional HMS \"Artemis\" is based on but does not follow in detail, the Second Battle of Sirte. The book was published before \"Penelope\" was sunk.\n\nPenny Mordaunt, the Defence Secretary of the United Kingdom for 85 days in 2019, is named after HMS Penelope. She has made reference to this fact in the House of Commons.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2212684", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2212684", "title": "Eucalyptus globulus", "text": "Eucalyptus globulus\n\nEucalyptus globulus, commonly known as southern blue gum, is a species of tall, evergreen tree endemic to southeastern Australia. It has mostly smooth bark, juvenile leaves that are whitish and waxy on the lower surface, glossy green, lance-shaped adult leaves, glaucous, ribbed flower buds arranged singly or in groups of three or seven in leaf axils, white flowers and woody fruit. There are four subspecies, each with a different distribution, occurring in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania.\n\n\"Eucalyptus globulus\" is a tree that typically grows to a height of but may sometimes only be a stunted shrub, or alternatively under ideal conditions can grow as tall as , and forms a lignotuber. The bark is usually smooth, white to cream-coloured but there are sometimes slabs of persistent, unshed bark at the base. Young plants, often several metres tall, and coppice regrowth have stems that are more or less square in cross-section with a prominent wing on each corner. Juvenile leaves are mostly arranged in opposite pairs, sessile, glaucous elliptic to egg-shaped, up to long and wide. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, the same glossy to dark green on both sides, lance-shaped or curved, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged singly or in groups of three or seven in leaf axils, sometimes sessile or on a short thick peduncle. The individual buds are also usually sessile, sometimes on a pedicel up to long. Mature buds are top-shaped to conical, glaucous or green, with a flattened hemispherical, warty operculum with a central knob. Flowering time varies with subspecies and distribution but the flowers are always white. The fruit is a woody conical or hemispherical capsule with the valves close to rim level.\n\n\"Eucalyptus globulus\" was first formally described in 1800 by the French botanist Jacques Labillardière in his book, \"Relation du Voyage à la Recherche de la Pérouse\". Labillardière collected specimens at Recherche Bay during the d'Entrecasteaux expedition in 1792.\n\nThe d'Entrecasteaux expedition made immediate use of the species when they discovered it, the timber being used to improve their oared boats. The Tasmanian blue gum was proclaimed as the floral emblem of Tasmania on 27 November 1962. The species name is from the Latin \"globulus\", a little ball or small sphere, referring to the shape of the fruit.\n\nIn 1974, James Barrie Kirkpatrick described four subspecies and the names have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census. Each subspecies has a characteristic arrangement of its flower buds:\n\nBlue gum grows in forests in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania, including some of the Bass Strait Islands. Subspecies \"bicostata\" occurs in montane and tableland areas between the Carrai Plateau in northern New South Wales and the Pyrenees in Victoria. Subspecies \"globulus\" is mainly found in lowland parts of Tasmania, but is also found on some Bass Strait islands including King Island, and in the extreme south-west of Victoria. Subspecies \"maidenii\" occurs on near-coastal ranges of south-eastern New South Wales and eastern Victoria. Subspecies \"pseudoglobulus\" is mostly distributed in eastern Gippsland but there are isolated populations further inland and in the Nadgee Nature Reserve in south-eastern New South Wales.\n\nThere are naturalised non-native occurrences in Spain and Portugal, and other parts of southern Europe incl. Cyprus, southern Africa, New Zealand, western United States (California), Hawaii, Macaronesia.\n\nThey typically grow from tall. The tallest currently known specimen in Tasmania is tall. There are historical claims of even taller trees, the tallest being .\n\nBlue gum is one of the most extensively planted eucalypts. Its rapid growth and adaptability to a range of conditions is responsible for its popularity. It is especially well-suited to countries with a Mediterranean-type climate, but also grows well in high altitudes in the tropics.\n\nIt comprises 65% of all plantation hardwood in Australia with approximately planted.\n\nIn about 1860 Francis Cook planted the tree on Monserrate Palace, his property at Sintra in Portugal and within twenty years it had attained the height of 100 m and a circumference of 5 m. By 1878 the tree ″had spread from one end of Portugal to the other″. In 1878 the tree was also planted, partly on Cook's recommendation, in Galway, Ireland to reclaim ″useless bog land″.\n\n\"E. globulus\" begun to be planted as plantations in Los Lagos and Los Ríos regions of Chile in the 1990s. However at these latitudes around the 40th parallel south the tree is at the southern border of the climatic conditions where it can grow, hence good growth in this part of southern Chile requires good site selection such as sunny north-facing slopes. Some of these plantations grow on red clay soil.\n\nBlue gum timber is yellow-brown, fairly heavy, with an interlocked grain, and is difficult to season. It has poor lumber qualities due to growth stress problems, but can be used in construction, fence posts and poles.\n\nThe leaves are steam distilled to extract eucalyptus oil. \"E. globulus\" is the primary source of global eucalyptus oil production, with China being the largest commercial producer. The oil has therapeutic, perfumery, flavoring, antimicrobial and biopesticide properties. Oil yield ranges from 1.0-2.4% (fresh weight), with cineole being the major isolate. \"E. globulus\" oil has established itself internationally because it is virtually phellandrene free, a necessary characteristic for internal pharmaceutical use. In 1870, Cloez identified and ascribed the name \"eucalyptol\" — now more often called cineole — to the dominant portion of \"E. globulus\" oil.\n\nTasmanian blue gum leaves are used as a herbal tea.\n\nBlue gum flowers are considered a good source of nectar and pollen for bees.\n\n\"E. globulus\" bark contains quinic, dihydroxyphenylacetic and caffeic acids, bis(hexahydroxydiphenoyl (HHDP))-glucose, galloyl-bis(HHDP)-glucose, galloyl-HHDP-glucose, isorhamentin-hexoside, quercetin-hexoside, methylellagic acid (EA)-pentose conjugate, myricetin-rhamnoside, isorhamnetin-rhamnoside, mearnsetin, phloridzin, mearnsetin-hexoside, luteolin and a proanthocyanidin B-type dimer, digalloylglucose and catechin. The hydrolyzable tannins tellimagrandin I, eucalbanin C, 2-O-digalloyl-1,3,4-tri-O-galloyl-β-D-glucose, 6-O-digalloyl-1,2,3-tri-O-galloyl-β-D-glucose, as well as gallic acid and (+)-catechin can also be isolated.\nTricetin is a rare flavone aglycone found in the pollen of members of the Myrtaceae, subfamily Leptospermoideae, such as \"E. globulus\".\n\nIt was introduced to California in the mid-19th century, partly in response to the Southern Pacific Railroad's need for timber to make railroad ties, and is prominent in many parks in San Francisco and throughout the state. Naturalists, ecologists, and the United States National Park Service consider it an invasive species due to its ability to quickly spread via seeds and displace native plant communities, while local authorities, especially many fire departments across California consider it to be a major fire hazard, although the United States Department of Agriculture does not list it among its \"Invasive and Noxious plants\" list in California. Due to these factors, programs across the state of California have been established to remove eucalyptus growth, and restore native biomes in certain park areas, such as on Angel Island in San Francisco Bay, and in the hills of Oakland, California.\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1875. \nIn the fall of 2017, Park had an enrollment of 11,457 students.\n\nThe school which was originally called Park College was founded in 1875 by John A. McAfee on land donated by George S. Park with its initial structure being the stone hotel Park owned on the bluff above the Missouri River.\n\nThe original concept called for students to receive free tuition and board in exchange for working up to half day in the college's farm, electrical shop or printing plant. According to the terms of the arrangement if the “Parkville Experiment” did not work out within five years, the college grounds were to revert to Park.\n\nThere were 17 students in the first school year and in the first graduation class there were five women. McAfee led until his death in 1890. His son Lowell M. McAfee became the second president of Park until stepping down in 1913. The first international student at Park University arrived in 1880 from Japan.\n\nThe defining landmark of the campus is Mackay Hall, named after Carroll County, Illinois banker Duncan Mackay who donated $25,000 in materials for the structure shortly before his death. The building was constructed using limestone mined on the campus grounds and built with the labor of students. Construction began in 1883 and was finished by 1893. Today the building is the main focal point of the campus and dominates the hillside, overlooking the town of Parkville. It is on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nFor many decades the school was affiliated with the Presbyterian Church but it no longer has that affiliation. The college has had a relationship with the military since 1889. However, the relationship was greatly expanded in the late 1960s with the establishment of a Military Degree Completion Program and later in 1972 with the Military Resident Center System. Park's total enrollment has grown from its small base since 1996 when it first began offering online courses. In 2000, it was renamed Park University.\n\nThe flagship campus of Park University is located in the city of Parkville, Missouri. The Park University Graduate School is located in downtown Kansas City, Missouri. There are 41 campuses in 22 U.S. states including four campuses in the Kansas City area (Downtown Kansas City, Independence, Lenexa and Parkville) and a campus center in Austin, Texas. Most of the satellite campuses are on or near United States military bases and share quarters with other businesses/organizations.\n\nThe home campus currently has an enrollment of 1,600 students representing 50 states and 106 countries. The entire extended system had an annual student enrollment of 23,000.\n\nIn 2018, the university opened a campus center in Gilbert, Arizona in the city's Heritage District. Park leased at the University Building. The university continued to expand the Gilbert campus in 2019, leasing an additional and extending the initial three-year term to five years with the city. The university continued to expand the Gilbert campus with the addition of college athletics. Initially playing as an independent during the 2019-20 academic year, the university announced membership in the NAIA and California Pacific Conference (Pac West) starting in 2020-21.\n\nPark University teams are known as the Pirates. The university competes in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) as a member of the American Midwest Conference (AMC). Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, track & field and volleyball; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, track & field and volleyball.\n\nThe Department of Athletics at Park University is led by Claude English, Director of Athletics, who was also the Pirates’ men's basketball coach from 1992 to 2005. From 1980 to 1984, English was the head men's basketball coach at his alma mater, the University of Rhode Island, and he played one season in the NBA with the Portland Trail Blazers in 1970-71.\n\nSeven former Park Pirates compete currently for the Kansas City Comets of the Major Arena Soccer League.\n\n\nPark University Gilbert teams are known as the Buccaneers. The university added a college athletics program to the Gilbert, Arizona campus center in 2019. After playing as an independent program during the 2019-20 academic year, the university announced membership in the NAIA and California Pacific Conference (Pac West) starting in 2020-21.

{"id": "2212695", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2212695", "title": "Alice in Wonderland (1976 film)", "text": "Alice in Wonderland (1976 film)\n\nAlice in Wonderland is a 1976 American erotic musical comedy film loosely based on Lewis Carroll's 1865 book \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\". The film expands the original story to include sex and broad adult humor, as well as original songs. The film was directed by Bud Townsend, produced by William Osco, and written by Bucky Searles, based on a concept by Jason Williams.\n\nThe plot revolves around Alice (Kristine De Bell), a librarian who falls asleep reading the book \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\", and dreams of the White Rabbit (Larry Gelman), who she follows into Wonderland, where she begins to experiment with her unexplored sexuality. Through a series of sexual encounters, Alice loses her sexual inhibitions and allows herself to become sexually liberated. The film is a softcore erotic comedy with orchestrated musical numbers which move the plot forward, and contribute to the film's humor.\n\nAfter premiering in a longer version, three minutes were edited from the film, and it was rated R by the MPAA, and released theatrically by General National, a company formed by producers Jason Williams and William Osco, due to other distributors being unwilling to distribute a sex film. The film grossed over $90 million at the box office. Osco later re-edited the film as a hardcore pornographic film, incorporating explicit sex that was not part of the film's original production. In 2004, Osco staged an Off-Broadway stage adaptation of the musical.\n\nAfter rejecting the advances of her boyfriend, William (Ron Nelson), mousy librarian Alice falls asleep reading \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\". The White Rabbit appears to her in a dream and she follows him into Wonderland. Finding herself in a room and too large to fit through the small door, Alice drinks a potion which causes her to shrink while her dress remains the same size, leaving her naked. While chasing the Rabbit, she falls into a river and begins to drown, but is saved by a group of local inhabitants. After making friends with them, Alice is given a new (albeit very revealing) dress before setting off after the Rabbit again. While walking through the woods, she begins to experiment with her sexuality by stripping naked and masturbating.The Rabbit happens upon her and takes her to meet the Mad Hatter.\n\nAfter being initially uncomfortable when the Mad Hatter exposes his penis to her, Alice ultimately performs fellatio on him. She is then called to assist Humpty Dumpty, who has fallen off a wall, causing him to lose the ability to achieve an erection. The situation is rectified when Alice performs fellatio on Dumpty. She is then taken to meet siblings Tweedledee and Tweedledum, whom she watches having passionate but incestuous intercourse. Following this encounter, Alice, the White Rabbit, and the Mad Hatter continue on toward the King's Ball. On the way, they come across a couple having sex in an open field; Alice chastises them, but she is ignored. At the royal court, the King converses with Alice, speaking with her about self-empowerment and ignoring the judgements of others; he ultimately seduces her.\n\nThe Queen suddenly appears, catching Alice and the king in bed together. A hurried trial is held and Alice is \"convicted\" of being a virgin. As punishment, the Queen orders Alice to have sex with her. A number of sexual escapades ensue among various characters as Alice prepares to carry out her sentence, including a brief lesbian encounter between Alice and the Queen's maids. Alice and the Queen engage in lesbian sex, but, as a result of the cunnilingus she receives from Alice, the Queen experiences an orgasm so strong it briefly incapacitates her. The Mad Hatter and White Rabbit assist Alice in escaping the Queen, who pursues to no avail.\n\nWaking from her dream and thereby returning to the real world, Alice meets William again. Having experienced a sexual awakening while in Wonderland, Alice accepts William's advances and they have sex in the library. In a closing sequence, Alice travels through Wonderland naked before she and William set off toward their new home where they live \"happily ever after.\"\n\nActor and director Jason Williams conceived the idea of producing an adult reimagining of \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" by Lewis Carroll, proposing that it be a \"X-rated musical\" following in the style of the sex comedy \"Flesh Gordon\", which he had starred in. Williams pitched the film to producer William Osco, who liked the idea, and hired comedian Bucky Searles to write the screenplay and songs, and raised $100,000 for the budget.\n\nProduction took place in New York City. Williams ran an ad in the \"Village Voice\" seeking auditions for a \"X-rated musical\", instructing that applicants \"must be able to sing and dance\". Williams was too busy with other aspects of the film's production to direct, so Bud Townsend was hired to direct instead. Townsend was a prolific director of television commercials, who Williams had met auditioning for his horror film \"Terror at Red Wolf Inn\". Though Townsend had never directed a sex film before, he was hired to helm \"Alice in Wonderland\", along with his wife, Patty, who served as the script supervisor. The dancing was choreographed by Buddy Schwab, who was a successful choreographer with Broadway credits. The film was initially going to be shot on 16mm film, but Townsend talked the producers into filming on 35mm film.\n\nJuliet Graham auditioned for the role of Alice, but was offered the role of the Queen of Hearts instead, which she accepted. Through a modeling agency, Kristine De Bell was cast as Alice. The 20-year-old fashion model had a background in musical theater, and could sing and dance. Many of the actors were regulars of New York's porn scene, while others were prominent character actors such as Larry Gelman, a friend of the screenwriter, who agreed to play the White Rabbit if he didn't have to appear nude, and if his wife and children could be flown out to New York on the production's budget. The auditions for singing and dancing performers primarily emphasized the actors' dancing abilities, as the producers planned to re-record most of the singing with professional singers.\n\nFilming took place in 10 continuous days in either June or July 1975. During filming, most of the actors stayed in the house used in the film. A scratch track of the film's musical numbers was used for the actors to lip synch to during filming.\n\nThe initial plan was to produce the film as a hardcore pornographic film, but once filming commenced, Williams said \"the vision for the film rapidly started expanding. We had these big sets, elaborate design, and we had this big opportunity. So we had this relatively short shooting schedule and we didn’t have much time to go in and do a lot of close-up stuff that you need for hardcore\", so the sex scenes were filmed in wide shots. De Bell performed in a unsimulated lesbian sex scene with Juliet Graham.\n\nCast and crew described Osco as being an intimidating figure, with Juliet Graham saying that Osco threatened not to pay her if she didn't spend an evening in his hotel room, and she did, but didn't have sex with him, telling Osco she was the girlfriend of porn actor Jamie Gillis. Osco convinced De Bell to allow him to film her performing oral sex on Osco, saying it was necessary for the film.\n\nThe film's budget was entirely spent on filming, and the production company Kaleidoscope Films provided $250,000 to $300,000 for the film's post-production. Musician and composer Peter Matz re-recorded the film's songs in full orchestral arrangements, and post-production was completed by the end of 1975.\n\nThe film's premiere was held on Times Square in 1976, at an event attended by Andy Warhol. It was well-received, but the producers could not interest a distributor because of an unwillingness to release a sex film, so Williams and Osco decided to form a new company to distribute it, calling it General National, explaining, \"At that time, there was a company called ‘National General’ [...] so if we just call ourselves ‘General National’ everybody will think it's the same damn big company, and we'll get treated in the same way\". For the general release, three minutes were removed, and the MPAA gave it a R rating. Concurrent with the film's release, De Bell appeared on the cover of \"Playboy\". Osco sold the foreign distribution rights to multiple distributors within the same territories, telling each distributor they had exclusive distribution rights.\n\nThe film grossed over $90 million globally. According to De Bell, the film grossed over $100 million, and although she told an interviewer that she had 1% ownership of the film, she didn't see any profits from the film's release.\n\nIn October 1976, lawyers for the Taconic Park Commission threatened a lawsuit against Osco after finding out that Osco had filmed on historical sites without permission. A month later, the film was reviewed by film critic Roger Ebert, who wrote, \"Maybe because I went with low expectations, I found the movie a pleasant surprise. And its most pleasant surprise is its star, Kristine De Bell, who projects such a freshness and naivete that she charms us even in scenes where some rather alarming things are going on. I think she has a future in the movies, and not just X movies, either; there's an openness to her expression, a directness to her acting, that's genuinely appealing.\"\n\nWilliams and Osco planned to make an adult film based on \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" as a follow-up, but it was not produced. Subsequently, Williams, Osco and De Bell made the film \"The Great American Girl Robbery\". Williams and Osco also planned to produce a \"American Graffiti\"-style film, and \"Pee Wee Pigskin\", a \"Bad News Bears\"-inspired football film with children.\n\nAfter \"Alice in Wonderland\" was released as a softcore film, Osco re-edited the film as a hardcore pornographic film, inserting explicit penetration shots into the film that were not part of the original filming, including the footage of De Bell performing oral sex on Osco, which was edited into the Mad Hatter sequence. Subsequently, multiple people in the production, as well as Kaleidoscope Films, sued Osco, who hadn't paid some of them, and had stolen money from others. Kaleidoscope ended up owning the rights to the film as a result of the lawsuit. Osco had prints of the film stolen so he could redistribute it without the owners' permission.

{"id": "2212696", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2212696", "title": "Social comparison theory", "text": "Social comparison theory\n\nSocial comparison theory, initially proposed by social psychologist Leon Festinger in 1954, centers on the belief that there is a drive within individuals to gain accurate self-evaluations. The theory explains how individuals evaluate their own opinions and abilities by comparing themselves to others in order to reduce uncertainty in these domains, and learn how to define the self.\n\nFollowing the initial theory, research began to focus on social comparison as a way of self-enhancement, introducing the concepts of downward and upward comparisons and expanding the motivations of social comparisons.\n\nIn the theory, Festinger provided nine main hypotheses. \nFirst, he stated that humans have a basic drive to evaluate their opinions and abilities and that people evaluate themselves through objective, nonsocial means (Hypothesis I).\nSecond, Festinger stated that if objective, nonsocial means were not available, that people evaluate their opinions and abilities by comparison to other people (Hypothesis II). \nNext, he hypothesized that the tendency to compare oneself to another person decreases as the difference between their opinions and abilities becomes more divergent. In other words, if someone is much different from you, you are less likely to compare yourself to that person (Hypothesis III). \nHe next hypothesized that there is a unidirectional drive upward in the case of abilities, which is largely absent in opinions. This drive refers to the value that is placed on doing better and better. (Hypothesis IV). \nNext, Festinger hypothesizes that there are non-social restraints that make it difficult or even impossible to change one's ability and these restraints are largely absent for opinions. In other words, people can change their opinions when they want to but no matter how motivated individuals may be to improve their ability, there may be other elements that make this impossible (Hypothesis V). \nFestinger goes on to hypothesize that the cessation of comparison with others is accompanied by hostility or derogation to the extent that continued comparison with those persons implies unpleasant consequences (Hypothesis VI). \nNext, any factors which increase the importance of some particular group as a comparison group from some particular opinion or ability will increase the pressure toward uniformity concerning that ability or opinion within that group. If discrepancies arise between the evaluator and comparison group there is a tendency to reduce the divergence by either attempting to persuade others, or changing their personal views to attain uniformity. However, the importance, relevance and attraction to a comparison group that affects the original motivation for comparison, mediates the pressures towards uniformity (Hypothesis VII). \nHis next hypothesis states that if persons who are very divergent from one's own opinion or ability are perceived as different from oneself on attributes consistent with the divergence, the tendency to narrow the range of comparability becomes stronger (Hypothesis VIII). \nLastly, Festinger hypothesized that when there is a range of opinion or ability in a group, the relative strength of the three manifestations of pressures toward uniformity will be different for those who are close to the mode of the group than for those who are distant from the mode. Those close to the mode will have stronger tendencies to change the positions of others, weaker tendencies to narrow the range of comparison, and even weaker tendencies to change their own opinions (Hypothesis IX).\n\nSince its inception, the initial framework has undergone several advances. Key among these are developments in understanding the motivations that underlie social comparisons, and the particular types of social comparisons that are made. Motives that are relevant to social comparison include self-enhancement, maintenance of a positive self-evaluation, components of attributions and validation, and the avoidance of closure. While there have been changes in Festinger's original concept, many fundamental aspects remain, including the prevalence of the tendency towards social comparison and the general process that is social comparison.\n\nAccording to Thorton and Arrowood, self-evaluation is one of the functions of social comparison. This is one process that underlies how an individual engages in social comparison. Each individual's specific goals will influence how they engage in social comparison. For self-evaluation, people tend to choose a comparison target that is similar to themselves. Specifically, they are most interested in choosing a target who shares some distinctive characteristic with themselves. Research suggests that most people believe that choosing a similar target helps ensure the accuracy of the self-evaluation. However, individuals do not always act as unbiased self-evaluators, and accurate self-evaluations may not be the primary goal of social comparison.\n\nIndividuals may also seek self-enhancement, or to improve their self-esteem. They may interpret, distort, or ignore the information gained by social comparison to see themselves more positively and further their self-enhancement goals. They will also choose to make upward (comparing themselves to someone better off) or downward (comparing themselves to someone worse off) comparisons, depending on which strategy will further their self-enhancement goals. They may also avoid making comparisons period, or avoid making certain types of comparisons. Specifically, when an individual believes that their ability in a specific area is low, they will avoid making upward social comparisons in that area. Unlike for self-evaluation goals, people engaging in social comparison with the goal of self-enhancement may not seek out a target that is similar to themselves. In fact, if a target's similarity is seen as a threat, due to the target outperforming the individual on some dimension, the individual may downplay the similarity of the target to themselves. This notion ties closely to the phenomena in psychology introduced also by Leon Festinger himself as it relates to the diminishing of cognitive dissonance. One does not want to perceive oneself in a way which would downplay one's original belief upon which one's self-esteem is based and therefore in order to reduce the cognitive dissonance, one is willing to change the cognitive representation of the other person whom one compares oneself to, such that one's own belief about oneself remains intact. This effectively leads to the comparison of apples to oranges or psychological denial.\n\nLater advances in theory led to self-enhancement being one of the four self-evaluation motives:, along with \"self-assessment\", \"self-verification\", and \"self-improvement\".\n\nWills introduced the concept of downward comparison in 1981. Downward social comparison is a defensive tendency that is used as a means of self-evaluation. When a person looks to another individual or group that they consider to be worse off than themselves in order to feel better about their self or personal situation, they are making a downward social comparison. Research has suggested that social comparisons with others who are better off or superior, or upward comparisons, can lower self-regard, whereas downward comparisons can elevate self-regard. Downward comparison theory emphasizes the positive effects of comparisons in increasing one's subjective well-being. For example, it has been found that breast cancer patients made the majority of comparisons with patients less fortunate than themselves.\n\nAlthough social comparison research has suggested that upward comparisons can lower self-regard, Collins indicates that this is not always the case. Individuals make upward comparisons, whether consciously or subconsciously, when they compare themselves with an individual or comparison group that they perceive as superior or better than themselves in order to improve their views of self or to create a more positive perception of their personal reality. Upward social comparisons are made to self-evaluate and self-improve in the hopes that self-enhancement will also occur. In an upward social comparison, people want to believe themselves to be part of the elite or superior, and make comparisons highlighting the similarities between themselves and the comparison group, unlike a downward social comparison, where similarities between individuals or groups are disassociated.\n\nIt has also been suggested that upward comparisons may provide an inspiration to improve, and in one study it was found that while breast cancer patients made more downward comparisons, they showed a preference for information about more fortunate others.\n\nAnother study indicated that people who were dieting often used upward social comparisons by posting pictures of thinner people on their refrigerators. These pictures served as not only a reminder of an individuals current weight, but also as an inspiration of a goal to be reached. In simple terms, downward social comparisons are more likely to make us feel better about ourselves, while upward social comparisons are more likely to motivate us to achieve more or reach higher.\n\nAspinwall and Taylor looked at mood, self-esteem, and threat as moderators that drive individuals to choose to make upward or downward social comparisons. Downward comparisons in cases where individuals had experienced a threat to their self-esteem produced more favorable self-evaluations.\n\nAspinwall and Taylor found that upward social comparisons were good in circumstances where the individuals making the comparisons had high self-esteem, because these types of comparisons provided them with more motivation and hope than downward social comparisons. However, if these individuals had experienced a recent threat or setback to their self-esteem, they reported that upward comparisons resulted in a more negative affect than downward comparisons.\n\nHowever, people with low self-esteem or people who are experiencing some sort of threat in their life (such as doing poorly in school, or suffering from an illness) tend to favor downward comparisons over upward comparisons. People with low self-esteem and negative affect improve their mood by making downward comparisons. Their mood does not improve as much as it would if they had high self-esteem. Even for people with low self-esteem, these downward social comparisons do improve their negative mood and allow them to feel hope and motivation for their future.\n\nIndividuals who have a negative mood improve their mood by making upward social comparisons, regardless of their level of self-esteem. In addition, both individuals with high self-esteem and low self-esteem who are in a positive mood elevate their mood further by making upward comparisons. However, for those who have recently experienced a threat to their self-esteem or a setback in their life, making upward social comparisons instead of downward social comparisons results in a more negative affect. Self-esteem and existence of a threat or setback in an individual's life are two moderators of their response to upward or downward comparisons.\n\nBecause individuals are driven upwards in the case of abilities, social comparisons can drive competition among peers. In this regard, the psychological significance of a comparison depends on the social status of an individual, and the context in which their abilities are being evaluated.\n\nCompetitiveness resulting from social comparisons may be greater in relation to higher social status because individuals with more status have more to lose. In one study, students in a classroom were presented with a bonus point program where, based on chance, the grades for some students would increase and the grades for others would remain the same. Despite the fact that students could not lose by this program, higher-status individuals were more likely to object to the program, and more likely to report a perceived distributive injustice. It was suggested that this was a cognitive manifestation of an aversion to downward mobility, which has more psychological significance when an individual has more status.\n\nWhen individuals are evaluated where meaningful standards exist, such as in an academic classroom where students are ranked, then competitiveness increases as proximity to a standard of performance increases. When the only meaningful standard is the top, then high-ranking individuals are most competitive with their peers, and individuals at low and intermediate ranks are equally competitive. However, when both high and low rankings hold significance, then individuals at high and low ranks are equally competitive, and are both more competitive than individuals at intermediate ranks.\n\nSeveral models have been introduced to social comparison, including the self-evaluation maintenance model (SEM), proxy model, the triadic model and the three-selves model.\n\nThe SEM model proposes that we make comparisons to maintain or enhance our self-evaluations, focusing on the antagonistic processes of comparison and reflection.\nAbraham Tesser has conducted research on self-evaluation dynamics that has taken several forms. A self-evaluation maintenance (SEM) model of social behavior focuses on the consequences of another person's outstanding performance on one's own self-evaluation. It sketches out some conditions under which the other's good performance bolsters self-evaluation, i.e., \"basking in reflected glory\", and conditions under which it threatens self-evaluation through a comparison process.\n\nThe proxy model anticipates the success of something that is unfamiliar. The model proposes that if a person is successful or familiar with a task, then he or she would also be successful at a new similar task. The proxy is evaluated based on ability and is concerned with the question \"Can I do X?\" A proxy's comparison is based previous attributes. The opinion of the comparer and whether the proxy exerted maximum effort on a preliminary task are variables influencing his or her opinion.\n\nThe Triadic Model builds on the attribution elements of social comparison, proposing that opinions of social comparison are best considered in terms of 3 different evaluative questions: preference assessment (i.e., \"Do I like X?\"), belief assessment (i.e., \"Is X correct?\"), and preference prediction (i.e., \"Will I like X?\"). In the Triadic Model the most meaningful comparisons are with a person who has already experienced a proxy and exhibits consistency in related attributes or past preferences.\n\nThe three-selves model proposes that social comparison theory is a combination of two different theories. One theory is developed around motivation and the factors that influence the type of social comparison information people seek from their environment and the second is about self-evaluation and the factors that influence the effects of social comparisons on the judgments of self. While there has been much research in the area of comparison motives, there has been little in the area of comparative evaluation. Explaining that the self is conceived as interrelated conceptions accessible depending upon current judgment context and taking a cue from Social Cognitive Theory, this model examines the Assimilation effect and distinguishes three classes of working Self-concept ideas: individual selves, possible selves and collective selves.\n\nThe media has been found to play a large role in social comparisons. Researchers examining the social effects of the media have used social comparison theory have found that in most cases women tend to engage in upward social comparisons with a target other, which results in more negative feelings about the self. The majority of women have a daily opportunity to make upward comparison by measuring themselves against some form of societal ideal. Social comparisons have become a relevant mechanism for learning about the appearance-related social expectations among peers and for evaluating the self in terms of those standards\" (Jones, 2001, P. 647).\n\nAlthough men do make upward comparisons, research finds that more women make upward comparisons and are comparing themselves with unrealistically high standards presented in the media. As women are shown more mainstream media images of powerful, successful and thin women, they perceive the \"ideal\" to be the norm for societal views of attractive. In recent years, social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram have made this more widespread, since social media makes it easier to compare yourself to the \"ideal\". Some women have reported making upward comparisons in a positive manner for the purposes of self-motivation, but the majority of upward comparisons are made when the individual is feeling lesser and therefore evoke a negative connotation.\n\nSelf-perceived similarities with role models on social media can also affect self-esteem for both men and women. Having more self-perceived similarities with a role model can help increase self-esteem, while having less can decrease self-esteem.Social comparison with peers on social media can also lead to feelings of self-pity or satisfaction. The desire for social comparison can cause FoMO and compulsive checking of social media sites. \n\nMany criticisms arose regarding Festinger's similarity hypothesis. Deutsch and Krauss argued that people actually seek out dissimilar others in their comparisons maintaining that this is important for providing valuable self-knowledge, as demonstrated in research. Ambiguity also circulated about the important dimensions for similarity. Goethals and Darley clarified the role of similarity suggesting that people prefer to compare those who are similar on related attributes such as opinions, characteristics or abilities to increase confidence for value judgments, however those dissimilar in related attributes are preferred when validating one's beliefs.\n\n\n"}

The main lanes elsewhere are the Sam Houston Tollway, a toll road owned and operated by the Harris County Toll Road Authority (HCTRA). East of Houston, the tollway crosses the Houston Ship Channel on the Sam Houston Ship Channel Bridge, a toll bridge; this forms a gap in Beltway 8 between I-10 (Baytown-East Freeway) and State Highway 225 (SH 225, La Porte Freeway).\n\nBeltway 8 is the intermediate beltway in the Houston area. The inner beltway—I-610—lies mostly within Houston (except for an approximate stretch that runs through the City of Bellaire), and the outer beltway—SH 99 (Grand Parkway)—is currently open to traffic, with other various segments under construction, or planning.\n\nLike other toll roads in the Houston area, the speed limit is .\n\nA previous route, called Loop 8, was designated on September 25, 1939, in Beaumont from US 59 (US 96 after the 1939 general redescription) at Gladys Street via Gulf Street, North Street, and Fourth Street to US 90 as a renumbering of SH 8 Loop. This was cancelled on January 18, 1944. The designation was created along the entire loop on May 7, 1969, but as Loop 8. On July 31, 1969, the designation was changed to Beltway 8. On July 24, 1978, the section from I-10 to SH 225 on the east side of Houston was cancelled.\n\nThe longest free section of main lanes is on the north side of Houston, stretching from Ella Boulevard east to Mesa Dr. This is maintained by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) east of roughly the Hardy Toll Road interchange. This particular free section has remained untolled since its 1969 opening because of accessibility to George Bush Intercontinental Airport. It includes the interchanges with I-69/US 59 (Eastex Freeway), John F. Kennedy Boulevard, the Hardy Toll Road, and I-45 (North Freeway).\n\nThree shorter free sections also exist:\n\nThese all exist in order to allow federal funding to have been used to build the freeway-to-freeway interchanges at the Baytown-East, Gulf and Southwest Freeways.\n\nThe frontage roads are generally continuous, and allow for slower free travel along the tolled segments. Only one break exists in the frontage roads; there are also several locations where one must turn to stay on them:\n\nThe lane count is for mainlanes only, unless otherwise noted. Starting at the north end of the Sam Houston Ship Channel Bridge, and moving in a clockwise direction, mainlane counts are as follows:\n\n\nA number of cameras are located at toll booths to record license plate information to a database and send a ticket via mail. Recently, this system has been upgraded to alert local authorities if a vehicle has been flagged for any reason, including AMBER Alerts. When a flagged vehicle is detected, it notifies the closest law enforcement officer to investigate. At this time, Precinct 5 Constables and Harris County Sheriff's Office are being notified, but Houston Police Department has shown interest and wishes to be included to be notified. The total number of cameras that are planned for the system is 35.\n\nHouston, known for its fast population growth, began planning for a second beltway in the 1950s (the first was the I-610 loop, created between the 1950s and the 1970s). The tollway's construction was done in a piecemeal fashion from the opening of the West Belt Drive and Roark Road, two surface streets, in the mid-1970s to the completion of the South Belt in the mid-1990s. The Jesse H. Jones Memorial Bridge, the tollway's crossing of the Houston Ship Channel, was constructed by the then-Texas Turnpike Authority (TTA) and was opened in 1982.\n\nThe TTA, however, turned down the opportunity to improve the entire beltway as well, leaving Harris County to upgrade the road to freeway standards. However, Harris County could not afford to build and maintain a freeway from its general fund.\n\nIn September 1983, county voters approved a referendum by a 7–3 margin to release up to $900 million in bonds to create two toll roads, the Hardy Toll Road (basically a reliever for I-45 between downtown Houston and Montgomery County) and the Sam Houston Tollway, which would be the main lanes of the Beltway. Shortly after the referendum, the Harris County Commissioners Court created the HCTRA to administer the construction and operation of the new road system. Then-County Judge Jon Lindsay is generally credited with shepherding the referendum from its infancy to its passage, along with the implementation of the plan for the roadway. During the public information campaign leading up to the referendum, the county government published brochures stating that the toll roads would become free once their construction costs had been recouped, but the tolls were not removed after the tollways were paid off.\n\nIn 1989, The Bangles performed at the opening of the segment of Beltway 8 between I-10 (Katy Freeway) and US 290. On July 7, 1990, a ceremony, called Road Party II, took place for the opening of the section of Beltway 8 between I-45 (North Freeway) and US 290, the final segment. Organizers had planned for a crowd of 100,000. KLOL, a radio station, sponsored the event. Jerry Lightfoot & The Essential Band did the opening 80-minute set. The band Huey Lewis and the News performed at the ceremony. The US 290-to-I-45 segment opened on July 8, 1990. The project was on schedule and $133 million (equivalent to $ in ) under budget.\n\nDespite recent speculation about the possibility of the Sam Houston Tollway being sold by HCTRA to a private firm, the Harris County Commissioners Court unanimously voted to keep the tollway in the hands of HCTRA.\n\nOn September 3, 2007, the toll increased by $0.25 system wide with some exceptions.\n\nOn February 26, 2011, construction of the main lanes between I-69/US 59 (Eastex Freeway) and US 90 (Crosby Freeway) was completed, thus completing the entire beltway system. This section was originally set to be completed between 2007 and 2009, but funding issues delayed its completion. The project cost $400 million (equivalent to $ in ) and was completed ahead of schedule and under budget. The new section has three lanes in each direction, and an EZ Tag, TxTag or TollTag will be required to access it. Almost 60 years had passed between the planning of Beltway 8 and the opening of the final section.\n\nOn August 28, 2017, Hurricane Harvey caused flooding to the West Belt and caused damage near I-10.\n\n\n"}

The Róndani family were wealthy landowners and of \"rich and of ancient origins\" with ecclesiastical connections preliminary and Camillo's early education was in a seminary. He then passed into the public school system where, encouraged by Macedonio Melloni his physics and chemistry teacher in the preparatory course for the University of Parma, he did not attend the law lessons his family had insisted on. He attended mineralogy classes given by a Franciscan priest, Father Bagatta and was taught natural history, a complementary course to botany for Medicine and Pharmacy. The Reader of Botany to the Athenaeum Parmesan was Professori Giorgio Jan, assistant at the Imperial Museum in Vienna and holder of the chair of zoology in Parma University. From Jan Róndani received many gifts to his collection: Coleoptera and a herbarium. Through Jan Róndani gained access to the house of the Conte Stefano Sanvitale, where an entomological club had access to the insect collection of Pietro Rossi.\n\nRóndani qualified as a lawyer in 1831. A plan to study zoology at the University of Paris, a condition of his proposed appointment as Professor of Natural Science in Parma came to nothing as Italy was thrown into political turmoil, the University urging its students to die for the unity of Italy, a resurgent demand of Giuseppe Garibaldi. Following the Ducal restoration after three years of provisional government not only was the chair of Zoology a distant dream, but the legal faculty had been removed to Piacenza in order to diminish the number of politically active students. Camillo and his brother Emilio, who had been imprisoned by the temporary government, turned to colonial commerce. Róndani studied the insects of the exotic products describing two of the beetles he found \"Cis jalapa\" from chillies and \"Brucus dolici\" from Santa Domingo coffee.\n\nIn 1833 Róndani married his first love, Petronilla, for whom he later named a new species of \"Ceria\" now \"Sphiximorpha petronillae\". The couple ran a family farm on the pleasant hillsides of Guardasone. This was transformed with dams and scientific soil management systems, and he used it to study agronomy and, with Petronilla, poetry and the arts. It was at this time that his studies of Diptera began, possibly because of their agricultural significance. A few years later Petronilla died and Róndani threw himself into entomology, working especially on the biology of parasitic insects (Diptera and Hymenoptera).\n\nAlthough little of his entomological work was published by Róndani himself, it raised him to preeminence. In 1840, he became a member of the Academy of France, published his first paper, and corresponded with Félix Édouard Guérin-Méneville on insects of Sicilian amber. Further publications rapidly followed on species new to Italy, new to science, plans of classifications, taxonomic arguments, and initial work on his masterwork, the Prodomo, a treatise on Diptera. Many were (confusingly) printed locally at the printing office in Parma, but then, following amendments in the entomological journals \"Nuovi Annali di Scienze Naturali di Bologna\", \"Magazin de Zoologie de M. J. Guérin Ménéville\", and the \"Annales de la Société Entomologique de France\".\n\nIn the nationalistic wars of 1848 the Róndani's were recalled to Parma. Camillo was briefly elected to represent Traversetolo. Following the catastrophic defeat of the Piedmontese at the Battle of Novara, Róndani retired back to Guardasone, and for some years, as Italians became increasingly involved in colonial ambition, worked on exotic Diptera. In these years he began to collaborate with the Irish entomologist Alexander Henry Haliday with whom he was to co-found the Italian Entomological Society.\n\nIn 1855, when Luisa Maria of Borbone, sister of Maria Christina of Bourbon-Two Sicilies reopened the university of Parma, which had virtually closed its doors in 1849, Róndani became Professor of Agronomy. From this date the Prodromo began in earnest, as Róndani alternated teaching with research much of it in applied entomology. He also remarried this time to his cousin Elisa Gelati. Ten years Parma became part of the United Provinces of Central Italy, joining Tuscany, Modena and Piacenza). This led to changes in the university. The chair of agronomy was abolished and Róndani became emerito University professor of the University and insignito of the cross of the Saints Maurizio and Lazzaro. He became a natural history teacher in the R.? Grammar school and also Director of the Agrarian Institute where he taught agronomy. Róndani remained in both posts for the next ten years though the Institute passed to the Provincial Administration in 1865.\n\nRóndani also became a popular writer for several newspapers and had various assignments from government and from the \"Camera d'Agricoltura e Commercio\" [Agriculture and Commerce Chamber] and the \"Giunta Superiore di Statistica\" [Advanced Committee of Statistics] for which he was awarded a medal. He maintained his interest in politics to the last, being an influential member of the \"Consigli della Provincia e del Comune\", unhesitatingly supporting liberal and progressive ideals. \"Come uomo fu moderatissimo nei desideri, semplice nel modo di vivere, costante negli affetti, irremovibile nei principii\".. moderate, simple, constant, and principled Camillo Róndani died on September 17, 1879. Róndani's collection is in La Specola Museum, Florence, Italy.\n\nPicture of Camillo Róndani \n\n\nOther works see Sabrosky's Family Group Names in Diptera\n\n\n"}

The G8, meeting for the first time in 1997, was formed with the addition of Russia. In addition, the president of the European Commission has been formally included in summits since 1981. The summits were not meant to be linked formally with wider international institutions; and in fact, a mild rebellion against the stiff formality of other international meetings was a part of the genesis of cooperation between France's President Giscard d'Estaing and West Germany's Chancellor Helmut Schmidt as they conceived the initial summit of the Group of Six (G6) in 1975.\n\nThe G8 summits during the 21st-century have inspired widespread debates, protests and demonstrations; and the two- or three-day event becomes more than the sum of its parts, elevating the participants, the issues and the venue as focal points for anarchists, anticapitalists and domestic terrorists.\n\nThe G8 is an unofficial annual forum for the leaders of Canada, the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nThe 30th G8 summit was the first summit for Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin.\nThese summit participants are the current \"core members\" of the international forum:\n\nTraditionally, the host country of the G8 summit sets the agenda for negotiations, which take place primarily amongst multi-national civil servants in the weeks before the summit itself, leading to a joint declaration which all countries can agree to sign.\n\nThe summit was intended as a venue for resolving differences among its members. As a practical matter, the summit was also conceived as an opportunity for its members to give each other mutual encouragement in the face of difficult economic decisions.\n\nThe protests against the 2004 meeting of the G8 Summit in Sea Island, Georgia, took place over the course of several days in the cities of Brunswick and Savannah, Georgia. Local police coordinated with the Georgia Army and Air National Guard, Georgia State Troopers, and agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, and the Secret Service, as well as officers from the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and others who arrived to control crowds and prevent terrorist attacks. Military vehicles (HUMVEEs) and Georgia State Patrol vehicles roamed the city streets and in Savannah and Brunswick near the bridge to the Island daily. The National Guard soldiers also patrolled on foot, searching for weapons and explosives and watching for known \"domestic terrorist\" groups and the so-called black bloc protesters.\n\nThe protests began in Savannah on June 8 with an anti-G8 march. However, about one third of those who marched were undercover agents from the FBI. Much of the planned \"black bloc\" protests in Savannah were thwarted when the leader of one \"domestic terrorist\" group was arrested in Savannah for possession of marijuana. Also, National Guard soldiers found several stockpiles of materials that the protest groups intended to use in a \"sleeping dragon\" maneuvers as well as bats with nails driven through them and piles of rocks and bricks. Then several protesters wearing all black clothing were confronted by National Guard soldiers in riot gear and then arrested by police after they congregated in front of the Starbucks and The Gap stores and began shouting antiglobalization slogans. At least three explosives were found by National Guard soldiers, though none of them turned out to be very big. One \"dummy bomb\" was found in a trashcan near a hotel where some members of the media were staying. It consisted of a shoe box with an alarm clock, newspapers and dead leaves. On the last day of the Summit, three protesters showed up on River Street, dressed as the Statue of Liberty, but they walked through the street quickly shouting anti-Bush slogans and then left.\n\nIn Brunswick, the protests began with an antiwar march on June 8, and a vigil was held on the night of June 9, which attracted about 300 people and the Fair World Fair. The following day, a group of around 100 protesters began congregating near the gates of a chemical plant, until they were directed by security to leave by. The last and most eventful action, the March for a Free Palestine, took place in Brunswick. Several activists made a replica of part of the wall being built between Israel and Palestine, and burnt it to the ground. A breakaway group decided to cross the bridge and head to Sea Island where the G8 meetings were wrapping up. However, the bridge is about 1.5 miles long, and the temperature was in the low 90s with the humidity being above 70 percent. Thus, after crossing the bridge, many of the protesters were overheated, and all were in need of water. They were given bottles of cold water by the National Guard troops who were waiting for them at the end of the bridge. Then the protesters voluntarily loaded onto air-conditioned buses and were taken back to the Brunswick side of the bridge. A few protesters wanted to continue their march, but they were blocked from entering Sea Island by a security fence and the same National Guard troops who were handing out water. So they sat down in front of the gate for about 20 minutes until the police ordered them to leave. A few were arrested, but most voluntarily loaded onto the buses and went back to Brunswick.\n\nThe protests were considerably smaller than past G8 Summits, owing in large part to the overwhelming military and police presence. The extent of the military and police presence was somewhat controversial as it led some to believe that martial law had been declared. However, then-Georgia governor Sonny Perdue was unapologetic about his decision to mobilize the security forces.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) designated the summit a National Special Security Event (NSSE), because of the protests and so many heads of state of government attending. However, DHS started to handle another NSSE at the same time: the state funeral of former president Ronald Reagan.\n\nThe G-8 Summit began three days after former U.S. president Ronald Reagan died. President George W. Bush was at the summit at the same time that Reagan's casket was brought to the Capitol to lie in state, which was on the second day of the summit (June 9). Taking his place at the ceremony at the Capitol was Vice-President Richard Cheney.\n\nSome of the world leaders who attended the summit decided to extend their stay in the U.S. to attend the funeral in Washington. One of them was German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder. Joining him in doing so were British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Schröder said about extending his stay: \"It is appropriate that the German chancellor says, 'Thank you,' and that is what I'm doing.\"\n\nThose that did not extend their stay, like Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin, French President Jacques Chirac, and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, also president of the European Union, paid tribute at the summit. The funeral took place the day after the summit ended. Martin cited the ongoing election campaign as the reason for not extending his stay in the U.S.\n\nAhern's tribute had special significance, as he paid tribute to Reagan's Irish roots, recalling his visit to Ireland in 1984.\n\nFor Afghan Interim President Hamid Karzai, the summit was part of his week-long visit to the U.S. He scrapped a visit to the West Coast to visit the Afghan community and went to Washington instead, beginning his visit there by attending the funeral.\n\nFor some, the G8 summit became a profit-generating event; as for example, the official \"G8 Summit\" magazines which have been published under the auspices of the host nations for distribution to all attendees since 1998.\n\nThe summit planning committee contracted with a Georgia-based wireless communication provider for 450 handsets and service to be used during the run up to the international event. In order to ensure reliable coverage in the coastal area around Sea Island, the company increased coverage and system capacity in advance of the summit. The handsets were deployed to coordinate operations, logistics, transportation, and other critical aspects of the preparations for the summit.\n\n\n"}

His career was erratic, partly because of his difficult personality, and the majority of his large projects were left incomplete, or subsequently destroyed. Much of what survives is in the form of drawings, many using \"a schematic, pale colouring as a timid and humble accessory to the dominating figure-drawing\", that were planned for large fresco commissions that never materialized.\n\nHe was born in Sanct Jürgen near Schleswig to a miller. He had a youthful passion for painting, but was apprenticed to a cooper (barrel-maker) for five years. After quitting his master in 1776, he went to Copenhagen, where he studied at the academy and supported himself for seven years by drawing portraits in red chalk, producing during the time a large historical picture, the \"Death of Æschylus\", and another painting, \"Æolus and Ulysses\". In 1783 he went to Italy where he was much impressed by the work of Giulio Romano. His means did not permit him to go beyond Milan and Mantua, where he remained a month and then went to Lübeck, where he lived five years painting portraits.\n\nHe was then introduced by the poet Overbeck to a wealthy patron, by whose aid he went to Berlin, where his \"Fall of the Angels\", a colossal picture containing over 200 figures, gained him a professorship in the academy of fine arts. Two years' labour in Berlin and a travelling pension enabled him in 1792 to go to Rome, and study the works of Michelangelo and Raphael. At the end of this time he made a strongly worded attack on the Prussian academy and was dismissed; he was based in Rome for the brief remainder of his life, where he developed his final style.\n\nHe gradually produced some fine subject and historical paintings, e.g. \"Plato's Symposium\" and the \"Battle of Rossbach\" which made him famous. He was appointed professor at Berlin, and in 1795 a great exhibition of his works was held in Rome in the studio of Pompeo Batoni; he died in Rome in 1798. He mostly designed in pencil or chalk and watercolour and painted paintings in fresco; he rarely painted in oil.\n\nA biography was published in 1806 by his friend, the critic and archaeologist Karl Ludwig Fernow, who was later the royal librarian at Weimar, which has the best collection of his graphic work. Bertel Thorvaldsen and Joseph Anton Koch both studied and worked with him in Rome, and copied many of his works; Koch made etchings of several, which were published in Rome in 1799. The Thorvaldsens Museum has several works by all three artists based on Carstens' designs.\n\n"}

Hamilton, published in 1993. It is the first book in the Greg Mandel trilogy. The novel introduces the major characters in the series, most notably Greg and Julia Evans. The novel combines elements of classic detective novels with science fiction.\n\nThe focus of the novel is the growth of the company Event Horizon, founded by Julia's grandfather Philip Evans. Beset by industrial saboteurs, the company seeks help in the form of ex–Mindstar Brigade soldier turned private detective Greg Mandel. The company is leading the way in rebuilding a twenty-first-century England after the People's Socialist Party (PSP), a tyrannical communist government, had first crushed the country and then collapsed, leaving it in shambles. Initially hired to solve a mystery involving missing stocks from a zero-g satellite production facility, he is then re-hired to find the source of attacks on a stored personality of Philip Evans after the industrialist's death.\n\nGreg Mandel is the lead character in \"Mindstar Rising\", plus two subsequent novels and a novella by Peter F. Hamilton. All the stories feature Mandel, Julia Evans and the company Event Horizon.\n\nThe stories are set in a near-future England, centred on Hamilton's own home county of Rutland. Mandel is a former officer of the \"English Army\", who fought in the \"Mindstar Brigade\", a tactical psychic unit. He was given the psychic powers of intuition and detecting emotions, skills he uses for his new profession of psychic detective.\n\nThe stories are set in a Britain recovering from the damages suffered during ten years of \"Marxist-Maoist\" dictatorship under the People's Socialist Party and also the ravages of global warming and collapsing financial markets.\n\nAfter three highly successful novels featuring Mandel had launched his career, Hamilton only briefly returned to him for the novella \"The Suspect Genome\". \"The Suspect Genome\" was published in \"Interzone\" in 2000 and was winner of the British Science Fiction Association Award for best short in 2001. Apart from this, Hamilton otherwise moved on to writing quite different books. The author said in 1996, that \"Greg was a very good start for me and people have enjoyed it and I think: \"leave it at that\".\n\n"}

If a material is periodic, it has a Brillouin zone, and any point outside the first Brillouin zone can also be expressed as a point inside the zone. So, the wave vector is then mathematically transformed to a point inside the first Brillouin zone. This transformation allows for scattering processes which would otherwise violate the conservation of momentum: two wave vectors pointing to the right can combine to create a wave vector that points to the left. This non-conservation is why crystal momentum is not a true momentum.\n\nExamples include electron-lattice potential scattering or an anharmonic phonon-phonon (or electron-phonon) scattering process, reflecting an electronic state or creating a phonon with a momentum \"k\"-vector outside the first Brillouin zone. Umklapp scattering is one process limiting the thermal conductivity in crystalline materials, the others being phonon scattering on crystal defects and at the surface of the sample.\n\nFigure 1 schematically shows the possible scattering processes of two incoming phonons with wave-vectors (\"k\"-vectors) \"k\" and \"k\" (red) creating one outgoing phonon with a wave vector \"k\" (blue). As long as the sum of \"k\" and \"k\" stay inside the first Brillouin zone (grey squares), \"k\" is the sum of the former two, thus conserving phonon momentum. This process is called normal scattering (N-process).\n\nWith increasing phonon momentum and thus larger wave vectors \"k\" and \"k\", their sum might point outside the first Brillouin zone (\"k<nowiki>'</nowiki>\"). As shown in Figure 2, \"k\"-vectors outside the first Brillouin zone are physically equivalent to vectors inside it and can be mathematically transformed into each other by the addition of a reciprocal lattice vector \"G\". These processes are called Umklapp scattering and change the total phonon momentum.\n\nUmklapp scattering is the dominant process for thermal resistivity at high temperatures for low defect crystals. The thermal conductivity for an insulating crystal where the U-processes are dominant has 1/T dependence.\n\nThe name derives from the German word \"umklappen\" (to turn over). Rudolf Peierls, in his autobiography \"Bird of Passage\" states he was the originator of this phrase and coined it during his 1929 crystal lattice studies under the tutelage of Wolfgang Pauli. Peierls wrote, \"…I used the German term \"Umklapp\" (flip-over) and this rather ugly word has remained in use….\"\n\n"}

{"id": "2212821", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2212821", "title": "John Cassell", "text": "John Cassell\n\nJohn Cassell (23 January 1817 – 2 April 1865) was an English publisher, printer, writer and editor, who founded the firm Cassell & Co, famous for its educational books and periodicals, and which pioneered the serial publication of novels. He was also a well-known tea and coffee merchant and a general business entrepreneur. A fervent Christian, he campaigned throughout his life for the temperance movement in Britain, for the reduction of taxes on publishing, and was a social reformer who recognised the importance of education in improving the life of the working class, and whose many publications, both magazines and books, brought learning and culture to the masses.\n\nJohn Cassell was born on 23 January 1817 in Manchester, then in Lancashire; the son of Mark Cassell, landlord of a public house called \"The Ring O' Bells\" at 8 The Old Churchyard, Hunt's Bank, Manchester. The family enjoyed a reasonable standard of living for the first 10 years until his father was disabled by a fall, dying 3 years later. The burden of providing for the family fell on his mother who made a living through upholstery work, though this left her with little time for her son. John received little education as a result and, from an early age, was required to work as a factory hand, manufacturing \"tape\" and velveteen. Cassell detested the work, which was both confining and monotonous, and felt oppressed by the appalling social conditions around him. Seeking better prospects, he impressed a local carpenter with his woodworking skills and was offered an apprenticeship.\n\nIn 1833, Cassell came under the influence of the temperance movement, and \"signed the pledge\" at a local meeting held by a Mr. Thomas Swindlehurst; he also witnessed the well-known temperance campaigner Joseph Livesey speak at the Oak Street Chapel in Manchester. At the time, alcoholism was a pressing social issue; tea and coffee were prohibitively expensive for the working classes, milk was seen as a luxury, and beer, by contrast, was relatively cheap and readily available. Cassell strongly identified with the ideals of the movement and, having first honoured his indentures of apprenticeship, decided to become a travelling temperance lecturer. Making good his lack of formal education, he had also sought self-improvement by teaching himself general knowledge, English literature and some French language.\n\nIn 1836, having spent several months lecturing on teetotalism in the Manchester area, Cassell set off by foot for London, stopping on the way to speak about temperance to any audience that he could find, and supporting himself by doing carpentry odd-jobs. In October 1836, after 16 days of walking, he finally arrived in London with the princely sum of 3 pence in his pocket, unable even to afford lodgings for the night. That same evening, he spoke at a temperance meeting at the New Jerusalem Schoolroom near Westminster Bridge Road, and for the next 6 months was involved in temperance campaigning in the capital.\n\nIn April 1837, Cassell was enrolled as a recognised agent of the \"National Temperance Society\", and toured around England and Wales, lecturing and taking total abstinence \"pledges\". In 1841, whilst on a temperance tour of the eastern counties, he met a Lincolnshire woman, Mary Abbott, whom he married the same year. Mary inherited a sum of money from her father which enabled the couple to settle in St. John's Wood, London, and gave John the capital he needed to invest in a business. Their home became a meeting place for writers, artists and reformers - people such as George Cruikshank, William and Mary Howitt, and Ellen Wood.\n\nIn 1843, Cassell set himself up as a tea and coffee merchant in Coleman Street, City of London. The business was an immediate success, moving eventually to larger premises in 80 Fenchurch Street. His teas and coffees were extensively advertised in the press, and slogans such as \"Buy Cassell's shilling coffee\" made them quite a household word. He bought a second-hand printing press to produce advertising leaflets for his wares and this led him to writing and publishing his own temperance tracts.\n\nCassell went into partnership with his brother-in-law, and this allowed him to concentrate on editing and writing periodicals, the first of which, \"\"The Teetotal Times\"\", appeared in 1846, becoming, in 1849, \"\"The Teetotal Times and Essayist\"\" a monthly, which continued for a few years afterwards. In July 1848, he started publication of \"\"Standard of Freedom\"\", a weekly newspaper aimed at the popular market, whose principles were free-trade and freedom of religion. It only lasted until 1851, becoming incorporated into the \"Weekly News and Chronicle\".\n\nIn 1850, he started the Working Man's Friend, a weekly magazine aiming to educate its readers without patronising them or playing to the lowest common denominator, and sympathetic to the life of working-class people. Its readers sent in hundreds of letters and articles for publication, and the magazine drew praise from figures such as Richard Cobden, politician and social reformer, and the Earl of Carlisle. In 1851, in order to expand the business, Cassell purchased William Cathrell's printing plant in The Strand, London, bringing the printing of the \"\"Working Man's Friend\"\" in-house.\n\nIn 1851, \"\"The Illustrated exhibitor\"\", a monthly periodical about The Great Exhibition, started publication, to great success, achieving sales of 100,000 by December. The expansion of the company meant a move to bigger premises at \"La Belle Sauvage Yard\" - previously the site of a centuries-old inn - on the north side of Ludgate Hill, in 1852.\n\nAround this time the \"\"Cassell's Library\"\" series started to appear; 26 volumes were eventually published including books on history, biography and science. In April 1852, the weekly \"\"Popular Educator\"\" started publication, achieving both popular success and critical acclaim - \"a school, a library and a university\" was how one commentator described it. The magazine inspired readers to continue their education in local classes, with Cassell offering practical and financial help where needed. It became something an institution, helping to improve the education, prospects and employment opportunities of the nation; even Lloyd George, future Prime Minister of Britain, credited the \"\"Popular Educator\"\" with bolstering his meagre childhood education and helping him to better himself. This was followed in 1852 with the \"\"Popular Biblical Educator\"\", which hoped to do for religion what its predecessor had done for general knowledge.\n\nIn 1853, the \"\"Illustrated Family Paper\"\" started publication, aiming to provide literary recreation for a family audience. It included not just educational articles but serialisations of novels as well. One of these \"\"The Warp and the Weft\"\", a tale about Lancashire mill workers by John Frederick Smith, appeared during the Lancashire Cotton Famine, and inspired readers of the paper to contribute a large sum to a relief fund for cotton workers. In 1867, after Cassell's death, the magazine was reduced in size and changed its name to \"Cassell's Magazine\".\n\nBy the end of 1854, an unexpected call to repay credit advanced by his paper supplier forced Cassell to sell the copyright and stock for the \"\"Illustrated Family Paper\"\", \"\"Popular Educator\"\" and other completed publications. This was only meant to be a temporary measure until the business found its feet again. Hence he found himself in semi-partnership with the printing firm \"Petter & Galpin\". During this interim period \"\"The Illustrated Family Bibl\"e\" a periodical in penny parts appeared and achieved popularity abroad as well as at home. In 1865 came the \"\"Illustrated History of England\"\", in weekly and monthly parts, totalling 8 volumes and with around 2000 illustrations; more than a quarter of a million copies were sold of the first edition.\n\nOther periodicals included \"\"The Illustrated Magazine of Art\"\" (1853–54, later revived as \"The Magazine of Art\" to greater success some years after Cassell's death), \"\"The Freeholder\"\" (monthly magazine of the \"free land\" movement), and the religious magazines \"\"The Pathway\" and \"\"The Quiver\"\" (first edition 7 Sep 1861). Cassell also conceived the idea of daily paper but this did not come to fruition until 3 years after his death; \"\"The Echo\"\", as it was called, lasted only a few years from 1868-1875, when it was sold off, continuing, under various management, until 1905.\n\nCassell visited America in 1853 to attend the \"\"World Temperance Convention\"\" in New York, and again in 1854 and 1859 on publishing business. He met the author Harriet Beecher Stowe and arranged for the publication of an illustrated edition of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" in Britain - to great success. Cassell strongly supported the cause of the slavery abolitionists.\n\nIn 1859, on his return from America, he went into full partnership with Petter & Galpin, the company becoming \"\"Cassell, Petter & Galpin\"\". The company was particularly successful in its production of illustrated editions of classic literature such as \"Robinson Crusoe\", \"Gulliver's travels\", \"The Vicar of Wakefield\" and others. The great French artist Gustave Doré provided illustrations for Dante's \"Inferno\" (1861), \"Don Quixote\", and a special edition of the \"Holy Bible\". The company's premises at La Belle Sauvage yard also gained the distinction of a visit from the French Emperor Napoleon III himself, as it was publishing the English edition of his book, \"\"The History of Julius Caesar\"\".\n\nCassell played an important part in lobbying government to reduce the burden of taxation on paper and periodical publications - the \"tax on knowledge\" as it was called - and his endeavours in the 1850s helped to repeal Newspaper Advertisement Duty, Newspaper Stamp Duty and Paper Duty (the latter in 1861).\n\nOn his return from America to London he started selling Cazeline Oil, for lighting, an early form of gasoline.\n\nIn his final years Cassell, seeing the business opportunities being opened up by the development of artificial light, set up an oil distillation works at Hanwell. Despite his efforts the venture came to nothing and, though no serious financial loss was sustained, the project was a great drain on his time and energy.\n\nCassell died, aged only 48, of an internal tumour, on 2 April 1865 at his home at 25 Avenue Road, Regent's Park, London - the same day as his friend Richard Cobden - and was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery. He was survived by his widow Mary, who died in Brighton on 6 July 1885. He also left a daughter, Sophia (d. 1912). The company, \"\"Cassell, Petter & Galpin\"\", which at the time of his death, employed 500 people, continued to prosper under the management of the remaining partners, Petter and Galpin.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2212828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2212828", "title": "Palmer Theological Seminary", "text": "Palmer Theological Seminary\n\nPalmer Theological Seminary is a multidenominational seminary affiliated with the American Baptist Churches USA. United Methodists, Presbyterians, Mennonites, African Methodist Episcopalians, and other Protestant church denominations are represented both on the Palmer faculty and in its student body. It was founded in 1925 as Eastern Baptist Theological Seminary. Its parent institution is Eastern University. Palmer Theological Seminary is located on the Eastern University campus at 1300 Eagle Road, St. Davids, PA. \n\nTwelve members of the Northern Baptist Convention founded Palmer Theological Seminary in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on March 19, 1925, intending to preserve their historic evangelical tradition as well as educate future ministers. Originally located on Rittenhouse Square, it moved in 1940 to Wynnewood, Pennsylvania, just across the street from the city boundary. In 2012, the seminary moved from the Wynnewood campus to an interim location at the American Baptist Missions Center in nearby King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. In June 2016, the seminary moved to the main campus of Eastern University in St. Davids, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe seminary originally established a collegiate division to prepare some students for the academic rigor of seminary-level courses. This evolved in 1952 into Eastern Baptist College, since 2002 Eastern University in St. Davids, Pennsylvania near Valley Forge and further west on the Philadelphia Main Line from Philadelphia. In 2004, Eastern Baptist Theological Seminary re-merged with Eastern University, now as a subsidiary. The following year, the seminary changed its name to Palmer Theological Seminary in honor of its longest serving president (1936–48), Gordon Palmer. In 2010, the University also established the Smith School of Christian Ministries to oversee certain programs. In 2012, the seminary sold this location and moved temporarily to the American Baptist Churches offices located nearby at 588 N. Gulph Road, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, between 2015 and 2016, the seminary moved to the main campus of Eastern University.\n\nOver the years, the seminary has combined evangelical theology with the affirmation of women in ministry and commitment to social justice and ethnic diversity. From the beginning, the Seminary welcomed female students. The Seminary continues to affirm its founding motto, \"The Whole Gospel for the Whole World.\"\n\nMasters Programs – The Master of Divinity (MDiv) degree is the standard post-graduate degree required by many Christian church denominations prior to pastoral ordination. The Master of Theological Studies (MTS) degree prepares students for further academic training (primarily the Ph.D.) and for non-pastoral vocations in areas such as public policy advocacy, Christian publishing, and social work. At Palmer, students may choose to pursue an MTS in General Studies or in one of the following areas of concentration: Biblical Studies, Contemporary Theology, Christian Faith and Public Policy, Christian Mission, Christian Heritage (History), and Christian Counseling.\n\nDoctor of Ministry – In 2009 the Seminary launched a Doctor of Ministry degree program focusing on leadership and church renewal.\n\nEastern School of Christian Ministry – Palmer offers several diploma and certificate programs designed primarily to provide quality theological education for those who do not have an undergraduate college degree.\n\nIn 2007, the Seminary began offering three scholarships covering half the cost of tuition at Palmer. As many as 10 openings are available each year for each of the three. The Brauch Scholarship is named for former Seminary president Manfred Brauch and his spouse, Marjean. The Sider Scholarship is named for professor Ron Sider, and the Wallis Scholarship honors Jim Wallis, the founder of the Washington, D.C.-based Sojourners community.\n\nThe former main building on the Palmer campus, located at 6 E Lancaster Ave in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania was once a resort hotel. The first floor of the building was renovated to accommodate staff offices and classrooms. The three upper floors serve as apartments or dorms for students and for some members of the Seminary's faculty and staff. Palmer's Laws Memorial Chapel building was constructed in the early 1950s with money donated by the late Marguerite Treat Doane. In addition to a sanctuary, the chapel features classrooms and faculty offices.\n\nIn 2008, the countries represented by students living on campus included Canada, South Korea, India, South Africa, Australia, and China.\n\nIn July 2005, an 80-page Beethoven manuscript of a piano four hands version of the Grosse Fugue was discovered in the library archives by one of the librarians. The manuscript was authenticated by Jeffrey Kallberg at the University of Pennsylvania and by Stephen Roe, head of Sotheby's Manuscript Department. Lost from view for well over 100 years, it is thought by some to be one of the most important musicological finds in recent years. The event paralleled the earlier find on July 31, 1990, of a Mozart manuscript, which had been donated to the seminary in 1951 by Marguerite Treat Doane (daughter of noted hymnist William Howard Doane). It was rediscovered along with some lesser manuscripts of the same period. The Beethoven manuscript was auctioned by Sotheby's in London on December 1, 2005 for US$1.72 million to an anonymous bidder later revealed to be Bruce Kovner.\n\n\n"}

The organization promotes music that involves the creative use of computers and electronics mixed with acoustics. Today, NWEAMO has showcased artists in prime venues across the world.\n\nIn a healthy cultural milieu NWEAMO celebrates both classical and popular music. The idea behind this seemingly controversial connection is that without any connection, both genres suffer. When classical music does not connect with popular culture, it becomes a music of experts, unable to reflect and contribute meaningfully in the broad marketplace of developing ideas and cultural experimentation. Popular music on the other hand, becomes naïve and superficial, untethered to its historical roots and broad cultural underpinnings, without connection and communication with classical music. NWEAMO attempts to generate a synthesis that reveals new possibilities for both.\n\nOriginally NWEAMO concerts featured a variety of electro-acoustic styles and genres, ranging from Intelligent dance music to the abstract avant garde. Eventually the word \"Electronic\" was replaced with \"Evolving\" in the acronym to reflect the inclusion of visual art, installation art, dance, sound art and acoustic music to the festival, and to allow future growth.\n\nIn 2002 the festival added San Diego, California to its locations. In 2005 the festival expanded further, with an additional night added in Mexico City. New York City and Venice, Italy were added 2006. The 2007 festival included a summer component in Europe (Berlin, May 18–19; and Venice, May 25–26) in addition to the main autumn festival: San Diego (Oct 5 & 6, 2007); Boulder, Colorado (Oct. 13, 2007); Morelia, Mexico (Oct. 19, 2007) & New York City (Oct. 26 & 27, 2007).

It was co-produced by Rysher Distribution in the United States, Gaumont Television in France, Reteitalia in Italy, RTL Plus in Germany, and Amuse Video in Japan. An alternate sequel to the 1986 feature film \"Highlander\", it features a storyline in which the protagonist of that film (Connor MacLeod, a member of a race of \"Immortals\") has not won \"the Prize\" sought by all Immortals, who still exist post-1985. Christopher Lambert reprised his role as Connor in the pilot episode, which introduced series protagonist Duncan MacLeod, an Immortal who was taken in by the same clan of Scottish Highlanders who had found and raised Connor generations before.\n\nThe series was an international hit and was nominated twice for the Motion Picture Sound Editors' Golden Reel Award (Foley Artist (\"The Gathering\"): 1992; Foley Artist (\"The Darkness\"): 1993), three times for the Gemini Award (Best Dramatic Series: 1996; Best Performance by an Actor in a Guest Role in a Dramatic Series: 1997 (John Pyper-Ferguson), 1996 (Bruce A.

Richie Ryan (Stan Kirsch) was introduced as a thief breaking into their shop and witnessing the confrontation between Duncan, the evil Immortal Slan Quince (Richard Moll), and Duncan's fellow clansman Connor MacLeod, the hero from the movies.\n\nAlso revealed was that Duncan had lived nearly 400 years, and was one of many such Immortals in the world. Connor had come to ask Duncan to return to the Game, to fight on the side of good against evil. \"The Game\" was the term used by the Immortals to describe their hunting of one another, seeking \"Quickenings\" by beheading their opponents. Duncan had been hiding from other Immortals for some time, removing himself from the Game. Now hunted by Quince, he had to face him, and by the end of the first episode, Slan was defeated and Duncan clearly caught up in The Game again.\n\nStorylines revolved around Duncan MacLeod and his relationships with mortals and other Immortals. Relationships formed a theme in the series, especially Duncan MacLeod's relationships with his friends, family, lovers, and foes (). As the series progressed, changes in concept become apparent, as well as normal growth in the characters and their relationships. Recurring Immortal characters such as Amanda and Methos made guest appearances in season one, and the Watchers, including Joe Dawson, were introduced in season two.\n\nIn the final episode of season 5, \"Archangel\", the character of Richie Ryan was killed off and the supernatural demon Ahriman introduced into the storyline. Of the 13 episodes of season six, two did not feature MacLeod, while in some he appeared in cameos: the producers were experimenting with introducing a new female Immortal character for a spin-off series. None of the introduced characters were chosen, and what came to be \"\" featured the recurring character Amanda in a starring role. The spin-off series lasted for one season, consisting of 22 episodes.\n\nEach episode began with an opening montage of scenes from Duncan's life, over which was a narration giving a brief overview of the series' theme. The first six episodes of the first season were narrated by Duncan himself:\nThis narration was slightly changed in the show's seventh episode, \"\" (again by Duncan):\nThe narration changed again in the second season, when Watcher Joe Dawson was introduced (narrative by Joe):\nThe narration changed again at the beginning of the fourth season, and remained until the end of the series' run (narrative by Joe):\n\nDuncan MacLeod and Tessa Noel have been living in the city of Seacouver in the Pacific North West for several years, where they run an antiques store. One night, a young street punk called Richie Ryan breaks into the shop whilst they are celebrating Tessa's birthday but is caught by MacLeod, who threatens to cut off his head with a sword. Stunned by MacLeod's seeming over-reaction, Richie watches as another man jumps in through the skylight and challenges the antiques dealer, only to be disconcerted by the appearance of a third man with a Japanese sword, who is in turn hunting him. The intruder is Slan Quince, who is hunting Duncan, unaware that he is himself the target of Duncan's kinsman, Connor MacLeod. Intrigued, the kid follows the MacLeods, only to see first Connor, then Duncan, fight Slan. He sees Connor defeated but escape, leaving Duncan to behead Quince. Amazed, he watches Duncan caught at the center of lightning and explosions as he witnesses, for the first time, a Quickening. Before he leaves, Connor tells Duncan that he must watch Richie, which Duncan does by taking in the boy, who has no family, and employing him in the antiques store. MacLeod also tells Richie the truth about himself and the others – that he is 400 years old and he, like them, is Immortal (\"The Gathering\"). As the series progressed, MacLeod encountered Immortals like Howard Crowley whom he killed in revenge for killing an Immortal friend of his and framing an innocent man for it (\"Innocent Man\"), Kiem Sun (\"Road Not Taken\") and taking in an Immortal student Felice Martin (Free Fall). He even saves Tessa from Immortals like survivalist Caleb Cole (for the only time in the series, Tessa sees Duncan caught in the power of a Quickening) (\"Mountain Men\") and Andrew Ballin, who wanted to kill her after she witnessed him killing his former lover (\"Eyewitness\"). Alexei Voshin, with whom he has an old score to settle (\"The Sea Witch\"), and Walter Reinhardt, another Immortal he had crossed paths with before (\"Revenge Is Sweet\").\n\nThe idyllic life of Duncan and Tessa is shattered by the arrival of a message from one of Mac's teachers, the priest Darius. Darius' most powerful enemy, Grayson, was coming to Seacouver, to eliminate a mortal peacemaker and disciple of Darius, Victor Paulus. Grayson was a lieutenant of Darius when they led an army across Europe in the 5th century but turned against him when Darius killed the then-oldest living Immortal at the gates of Paris and became a man of peace. Determined to protect Tessa and Richie but uncertain of his ability to handle Grayson, he sends them to Darius for protection, then sets out to face Grayson. Grayson offers MacLeod a position at his right hand, but is refused. Grayson takes MacLeod to the limit before the Highlander prevails. MacLeod follows his friends to Paris, where he and Tessa decide to stay, living on Duncan's barge. Tessa takes up a post as a curator, Duncan takes up the role of a kept man and Richie that of a fish out of water (\"Band of Brothers\").\n\nDuncan does the shopping, but as he is returning to the barge one morning, he sees a man dressed as a mime kill an elderly man (\"For Evil's Sake\"). Helping the police, he tells them that he can identify the man. The police inspector, LeBrun, is convinced he has seen Duncan before. Later, mysterious men with guns stake out the barge and, when Duncan fells one, he finds that he is a policeman. LeBrun has remembered Duncan – when he was a young gendarme, they were chasing the assassin Kuyler and he saw Duncan then. LeBrun's assistant is in Kuyler's pay, but Duncan silences the mime forever and LeBrun arrests his assistant. Duncan hasn't finished with LeBrun, for when his old enemy Xavier St Cloud crosses his path again, Duncan throws one of Xavier's gas grenades into a cement mixer and LeBrun fishes it out (\"For Tomorrow We Die\"). Convinced MacLeod is the gas poisoner, LeBrun tries to run him in whilst Duncan has to stop Xavier from gassing an exhibition Tessa is organizing. Frustrated, Xavier comes for Duncan, but Duncan cuts off Xavier's hand and he disappears into the Seine. The series also introduced two old Immortal lovers of Duncan’s to test Tessa's restraint. Grace Chandel, on the run both from the police, who want to arrest her for killing her mortal husband, and the Immortal ex-lover who was the real killer, the possessive Carlo Sendaro (\"Saving Grace\") was welcomed by Tessa, when Duncan and Darius help her escape, Duncan making sure that Carlo will not trouble her again. The same was not true of Amanda, described by Duncan as \"a bad habit\". In \"The Lady and The Tiger\" we met the unprincipled cat-burglar with a passion for circuses, robbery, and 400-year-old Scotsmen, here trying to set up MacLeod so that the Immortal thief she had double-crossed, Zachary Blaine, would not take her head. In the end, she takes Zachary's, but not before Duncan has done all the hard work. Which pretty much set the pattern for all of the Amanda stories to come.\n\nIn the season finale, Duncan's old friend, Hugh Fitzcairn, comes to see him, with news that Immortals are disappearing. When they go to see Darius, they find him decapitated inside the church. Returning to Fitz's hotel, they are attacked and Fitz is spirited away, whilst Duncan returns to the church, finding a mysterious book hidden by Darius. It is a history of Immortals written by a secret society of mortals. When these mortals come for Duncan, he is ready and follows them back to their hideout, rescuing Fitz, who is about to be guillotined and confronting their leader, a wild-eyed fanatic who wants to destroy all Immortals. He gets away, leaving a shattered MacLeod to mourn his friend and teacher. The season ends with MacLeod vowing revenge on the men and pouring Darius' ashes into the Seine, to flow out to the sea (\"The Hunters\").\n\nThis season opened with a new title sequence and a mysterious voice over explaining who Duncan MacLeod is and giving a quick summary of the Rules of the Game. Not so mysterious a voice, as we were to find out, as it is the voice of Joe Dawson. In the first story, (\"The Watchers\"), a bitter MacLeod returns to Seacouver, determined to find Darius' killers, but with only the Chronicle left by Darius to guide him. He follows a clue to a bookstore, where the manager, Dawson, denies knowing about the book. When MacLeod chases down two men watching from across the street, Dawson follows and tells Duncan that he is his Watcher, one of a secret society of mortals who observe and record the history of the Immortals, but never interfere. He refuses to believe MacLeod's assertion that Darius was murdered by mortals, but is forced to when the leader of the killers is revealed to be his own brother-in-law, James Horton. MacLeod confronts Horton, who shoots him, but not before MacLeod extracts his vengeance for Darius and runs Horton through with his sword. Believing Horton dead, but now aware of the Watchers, MacLeod carries on with his life and tries to help two old friends, but with differing results. Gregor Powers has become a photographer but has lost touch with his humanity, pushing his feelings for others away to avoid the recurring pain of loss (\"Studies In Light\"). Duncan helps him to learn to value his life and the gift of his Immortality, whilst watching his own former lover, Linda Plager, who is mortal, die of old age and infirmity. Soon after, another Immortal friend, Michael Moore, appears, looking for Mac's help in hunting down Quenten Barnes, Michael's long time enemy, who has reappeared after a long absence (\"Turnabout\"). Also reappearing is Joe Dawson, who tries to enlist Duncan's help, as Barnes is hunting down and killing the men who tried and executed him years before (\"Turnabout\"). Barnes was buried and has only recently been disinterred. An uneasy peace is struck between Watcher and Immortal, as the terrible truth dawns – Michael is Quenten Barnes, the two sides of his personality fragmented into a schizophrenic existence. As Quenten slowly takes permanent control, Michael pleads with Duncan to end it and MacLeod kills his friend. During this episode, Mac takes Richie to a martial arts gym, or \"dojo\", run by Charlie DeSalvo, where they intend to train. Thoughts of extra-curricular activities are put aside as the reopening of the antiques shop gets nearer. After a spooky encounter with a palm reader reminds Mac of the gypsies' warning that he will never marry, he tempts fate by asking Tessa to marry him. Overjoyed, she accepts and, as they plan the wedding, Mac is lured from the shop by a group of Watchers, whose leader, Pallin Wolf, stuns Richie and kidnaps Tessa. Using her as a lure, he entices MacLeod to his home, where he has a lightless room in which he hunts and kills Immortals, using a nightscope to see his prey (a la \"Silence Of The Lambs\"). Fate smiles on Mac by allowing him to defeat Wolf and rescue Tessa despite \"The Darkness\", but he makes a decision that will haunt him. Sending Tessa with Richie, he stays to rifle the man's files, but as they leave, they are mugged and shot dead. MacLeod runs out to find them both lying in the street. As he holds Tessa in his arms, Richie revives, a newborn Immortal. Grief-stricken, MacLeod sells the store. Richie arrives at the loft one night with a girl he has rescued, who was being pursued by an Immortal (\"Under Color Of Authority\"). From the description, Duncan recognizes that the hunter is Mako, an eternal lawman. The girl is evasive, but it transpires that she is on the run for murdering her husband, who abused her, but she fears that she will be killed if she goes back, as her husband's father runs the town. Mako doesn't care – he has a warrant and will take her back to stand trial. Richie refuses to stand by and helps her to flee, but when Mako accidentally kills the girl, Richie is enraged and challenges Mako, whom he kills, despite Duncan pleading with him not to. For the first time, Richie feels the power of a Quickening, but it is tinged with sadness as Mac tells him that he is now on his own and must leave.\n\nDuncan takes Anne to a recital by a choir of monks, one of whom, Paul, is an Immortal. Neither man realises that the song being sung is \"The Song Of The Executioner\", as the unseen impresario who organised the concert is Kalas, an Immortal with scores to settle with both Duncan and Paul. Kalas kills Paul and then sets about destroying MacLeod, first by framing Joe for dealing drugs then by killing two of Anne's patients and fabricating hospital records to make it look like she is responsible. Duncan realises that Kalas is behind this and, having cleared Joe and Anne, confronts his enemy. As they fight, Anne sees Duncan fall to his death, but Richie gets her away before Duncan revives.\n\nIn the midst of this, Richie embarks on a new career in motorcycle racing. Rather than tell Anne the truth, especially with Kalas at large, Duncan leaves Seacouver, arranging for Maurice to buy back the barge in Paris. Arriving in Paris, Duncan is greeted by Hugh Fitzcairn, who is teaching cookery at the Cordon Bleu, (\"Star Crossed\"). The normally philandering Fitz is in love but has a rival, who tries to kill him by running the two Immortals off the road. At the same time, Richie arrives in France, looking to build on his American successes in motorcycling. Whilst Fitz tells Duncan he should trust Anne, Kalas frames Fitz for the murder of his rival. On the run, Fitz is confronted by Kalas, who beheads him as MacLeod helplessly watches. When Duncan comes for Kalas, his nemesis escapes into a cloud of steam.\n\nDetermined to finish Kalas, Duncan seeks Joe's help. Kalas owns a nightclub and Duncan \"persuades\" the bartender to tell him where Kalas has gone. Kalas has captured his own Watcher and is looking for information on \"Methos\", the legendary oldest Immortal. After Kalas kills one of the Watchers' historians, Donald Salzer, Dawson sends Duncan to a researcher on the Methos Chronicle, Adam Pierson. Duncan is stunned to find that Pierson is Methos. Kalas confronts Methos, who escapes and sets up Duncan to take his head, realising that he cannot handle Kalas, but Duncan could. Duncan refuses, but when he confronts Kalas at Methos' apartment, their fight is interrupted by the police, who arrest Kalas for Salzer's murder after Adam Pierson identifies Kalas. Before he vanishes from Paris, Methos tells Duncan that he couldn't take the chance on Kalas winning.\n\nIn the two part season Finale, Amanda arrives at the barge, being very, very nice to Duncan, which always arouses his suspicions, (\"Finale\"). Eventually, she tells him that she broke Kalas out of jail, to kill him, but that Kalas got away. Kalas, using the thugs employed by his cellmate, wastes no time in coming for MacLeod and, as Duncan and Amanda try to find him, finds Maurice, who Duncan rescues in the nick of time and sends out of Paris. Kalas captures Amanda, intending to use her as bait, but she escapes. A new problem arises, when Joe Dawson and Methos arrive at the barge. Christine Salzer, the widow of Donald Salzer, the historian Kalas murdered, has found a database created for the Watchers and intends to give it to the newspapers. Dawson tries to stop her, even trying to shoot her, but MacLeod prevents him from becoming a murderer, taking the bullet himself.\n\nAs the Immortals think that their secret will be on CNN, Kalas intercepts Christine and kills her, taking the vital disk. He uses the information to find the European head of the Watchers and kills him. He gives Duncan a choice – surrender to him or Kalas will broadcast the information on the disk. Watchers and Immortals combine to hunt Kalas down. Methos tells Duncan to fight Kalas. Amanda and Duncan, faced with the destruction of their world, finally admit their feelings for each other openly. Duncan faces Kalas on the top of the Eiffel Tower and takes his enemy's head. The Quickening of such a powerful Immortal surges through the steelwork of the tower and overloads the Paris power grid, plunging the city into darkness and, in the process, blowing up Kalas' computer and destroying the disk. After celebrating Duncan's victory over Kalas and remembering Paul and Fitzcairn, Joe and Methos leave Duncan and Amanda alone to work out how much of what they said to each other they really want to take back.\n\nWith Kalas dead, MacLeod is free to return to his normal life and resumes his interest in antiques, until one night he sees a bracelet in a private showing at a dealer's, a bracelet he thought long buried. Shadowed by a curious Joe Dawson, he returns to his native Scotland for the first time in two hundred years to return it to the grave of his first love, Debra Campbell. Once in Glenfinnan, he is greeted with hostility by Rachel MacLeod, the local innkeeper, as the village is beset once again by mysterious murders. With the villagers recounting the legend of Duncan MacLeod, who rose from the dead to claim his father's sword and kill the Viking raider, Kanwulf, Rachel slowly comes to trust Duncan as the legend plays itself out again and, this time, Duncan make sure he takes the Viking's head and Quickening before leaving Glenfinnan at peace. (this marked Adrian Paul’s directorial debut in the series) The episode that followed saw the final guest appearance of Phillip Akin as Charlie DeSalvo who was killed by immortal Andrew Cord in Brothers in Arms. The season also saw the friendship of Joe and Duncan temporally end. But mid season saw Duncan like never before as an evil immortal after being affected by the Dark Quickening which corrupts him leading him to turn on his friends (Richie and Joe). In the episode Deliverence, Duncan with the help of Methos is able to overcome the evil inside him. The cliffhanger ending to Season Four starts with a telephone call that brings Joe Dawson to Paris, in the belief that MacLeod is dead . Standing on the Quai, he is kidnapped in front of Duncan, who finds out from Methos that Joe is on trial for his life before the Watcher tribunal. Watchers are being killed across Europe and the Watchers believe that Joe's revelation of their secret is the root cause, unaware that it is the consequences of their own hypocrisy and double standards that is visiting destruction upon them. Blind to their own arrogance and willingness to interfere in the Game, they ignore Duncan's pleas for clemency. As they prepare to execute Dawson, it is they who are judged as a mysterious Immortal guns down the Watcher hierarchy and flees past Duncan, who arrives in time to find Dawson wounded and unconscious in the final scene.\n\nAfter the events in \"Judgment Day\", the Watchers abandon all pretense of not interfering in the Game. Believing that MacLeod is responsible for the slaughter of the Watchers, Jack Shapiro, their head, orders his death and, at the beginning of \"One Minute To Midnight\", Duncan is trying to survive their manhunt. Believing the only way to avoid a war between the Watchers and the Immortals is to convince Shapiro of his innocence, MacLeod goes to their battle headquarters, only to find that the Immortal who is the real killer has beaten him to the punch. The bitter irony of the situation is revealed – Jacob Galati is hunting the Watchers after Horton killed his Immortal wife, Irena, during his rampage across Europe in 1992 that ended when he killed Darius in Paris, (\"The Hunters\"). Jacob refuses to believe that the Watchers are not evil, but agrees to meet Joe, who has been nursed back to health by Methos. Joe won't meet Jacob though and helps the Watchers to capture him. Duncan is forced to stand by whilst the Watchers murder Jacob and is devastated to receive his friend's Quickening. Methos rejects Joe and the Watchers for what they have become, but MacLeod returns to confront Shapiro, to put an end to the killing. When Shapiro refuses, Joe belatedly realizes that his friend has become another Horton and helps Duncan to secure peace with the Watchers. Wanting nothing to do with Paris, Duncan returns to Seacouver. There, he finds the Immortal Cassandra waiting for him. She is being hunted by Roland Kantos, one of her students, and she tells Duncan of a \"Prophecy\" that he will defeat great evil. Kantos relies on the hypnotic power of his voice to defeat his opponents, but Duncan, after nearly losing his head to Kantos' tricks, defeats the mesmerist by plugging his ears. Joe comes to the dojo and gets the cold shoulder from Duncan, but before he leaves, he tells MacLeod that Richie is in town, (\"The End Of Innocence\"). Duncan tries to make his peace with Richie, but the young Immortal is still plagued by nightmares after Duncan almost killed him in \"Something Wicked\" and warns Duncan to stay away from him. When Richie challenges and kills Carter Wellan, his mentor Haresh Clay comes for Richie, breaking his sword. Richie is arrested trying to steal another one from a museum and is bailed out by Duncan, who warns him that Clay is as good as they come and gives him a sword. The two Immortals work out their differences and, now acting as equals, it is Duncan who asks Richie to stand aside as he avenges his humiliation at Clay's hands when they first met and takes his head. In \"Archangel\" Duncan accidentally kills Richie thinking he is a demon he is destined to face.\n\nThe series dealt with the Ahriman story arc in the first two episodes. A majority of the season dealt with Duncan meeting some female Immortals. The producers were experimenting to look for a replacement to Duncan for the planned spin-off \"Highlander: The Raven\".\n\n\"Highlander: The Series\" originated in Europe. Christopher Lambert, who had then starred in the first two \"Highlander\" movies, had previously worked with French leading entertainment conglomerate Gaumont's president Christian Charret. Lambert knew that \"Highlander\" producers Peter Davis and Bill Panzer wanted to make a \"Highlander\" series and connected them with Charret. Gaumont bought the rights to the series. \"Highlander\" was one of the first projects developed by Gaumont's television branch opened in 1992 and one of its financial backers was the French bank Credit du Nord.\n\nThe French leading production company Gaumont Television bought the rights to the series to have it produced in syndication in America with a local crew, a ground-breaking move at the time. \"Highlander\" marked the first time a French production company was creatively involved in a show intended for the American market. The show was co-produced in syndication by international partners including Gaumont, RTL Plus (Germany), Rysher Distribution (United States), Reteitalia Productions (Italy), Amuse Video (Japan) and TF1 (France). The budget of the first season was US$26.1 million. Keith Samples, president of Rysher, stated that \"about 75% of the guaranteed budget came from overseas sales.\" The remaining 25% came from United States sales and the producers retained the distribution rights, which allowed the show to produce $800,000 per episode only from international income, believed to be the top result of the 1992–1993 season. To secure an adequate share of European content, and as a result of the co-production agreement, each season was divided into two segments, the first segment was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada (posing at the fictional location of Seacouver, Washington, United States), the second in Paris, France. The production of the first segment began in Vancouver on July 13, 1992, while the production of the second segment started in December 1992 in Paris and used the studios of French state production agency Société Française de Production (SFP) at Bry-sur-Marne near Paris.\nThe executive producers were Bill Panzer, Peter S. Davis, Gaumont Television president Christian Charret and Gaumont co-production chief Marla Ginsburg. Steven Maier, Sheryl Hardy and Guy Collins were co-executive producers. Kevin Droney and Philip John Taylor were supervising producers at the beginning of the season; from the seventh episode onwards, David Abramowitz became supervising producer instead of Taylor. The producers were Barry Rosen and Gary Goodman. Executives in charge of production were Marc du Pontavice and Denis Leroy. Scripts were contributed by both staff and freelance writers, Brian Clemens among the latter. Brent-Carl Clackson was line producer on the Vancouver segment, from episode one to thirteen. When production moved to Paris, Clackson was succeeded by Patrick Millet (with the title of production manager) for episodes fourteen to twenty-two. The regular directors were Thomas J. Wright, Jorge Montesi and Ray Austin. The fencing coach was Bob Anderson, who coined for himself the title of Master of Swords. Anderson choreographed the fights on the Vancouver segment then was succeeded by Peter Diamond, credited as second unit director and stunt coordinator on the Paris segment. At the beginning of Season 3, F. Braun McAsh became the Swordmaster and choreographed the remaining four seasons and the fourth movie, \"Endgame\". The opening theme was \"Princes of the Universe\" from the 1986 album \"A Kind of Magic\" by Queen; incidental music was composed by Roger Bellon. The pilot episode was originally intended to be a third \"Highlander\" movie (to act as a television movie), but the low budget and Lambert agreeing to reprise his role as Connor MacLeod late into production caused the pilot to be written as a one-hour pilot.\n\nChristopher Lambert did not wish to do television, though he agreed that there should be a series, and originally Connor MacLeod was to be the protagonist. After Lambert declined, and because there were still films being made with the Connor character, it was decided at Adrian Paul's request to have the series focus on another MacLeod. Lambert agreed to appear in the pilot and pass the torch. They were only able to afford him for three days of filming. Lambert declined to do any future episodes.\n\nAlastair Duncan, Anthony De Longis, Alexis Denisof, Geraint Wyn Davies, Gary Daniels, and James Horan were all in the running for the lead role. Marc Singer who was originally offered the role of Connor MacLeod in the original movie was also a front runner for the lead. Dutch actor Derek de Lint was eventually cast as Connor Macleod but for unknown reasons he left the project before production began. Adrian Paul beat out 400 hopefuls from the U.S, Canada and Europe for the lead role. Originally, the actor was a tough sell to the investors because he was an unknown (though he played Russian ballet dancer Kolya in \"The Colbys\"). However, the producers felt that he would appeal to both male and female fans of the franchise. Paul reminded them of a young Sean Connery. Paul said in an interview that he was drawn to the series because it had so many layers: history, romance, adventure and spirituality. In an interview he said that he was the very first person to audition for the role in Los Angeles.\n\nCanadian born French musician Mylene Farmer was offered the role of Amanda but she turned down the role. Ron Perlman and John Rhys Davies were considered for the role of Methos. Perlman guest starred in the fifth season episode \"The Messenger,\" playing an Immortal pretending to be Methos, played by Peter Wingfield.\n\nAlthough Immortals are scattered around the world, the events of the series are most notably located in Vancouver, British Columbia and Paris, France. However, flashbacks during the series often brought the show to a variety of places. The locations for the present switched just past the midway point of seasons 1–5 from Seattle/Vancouver to Paris. Thus it became the second international TV series about a Scottish swashbuckler in France after the series \"Quentin Durward\" which had already been shot in back in 1970 and resembles many of Duncan MacLeod's (and Connor MacLeod's) historical flashbacks. In Paris, Duncan lived on a barge located on the Seine River (at approximately ) while in the fictional city of \"Seacouver, WA\" (somewhere in the Pacific Northwest) Duncan moved after Tessa's death from their antiques store to an apartment above his recently acquired freestyle dojo.\n\nBeginning in 1995, full seasons of \"Highlander\" were released on VHS. These releases were the European cuts of the episodes, with each episode having approximately four minutes of additional footage not seen on American television. The first four season sets featured 11 VHS tapes, with two episodes on each tape. Prior to the release of the individual seasons, in October 1993, a feature-length release titled \"Highlander: The Gathering\" was released on VHS, which combined the episodes \"\" and \".\"\n\nThe series has been released on home video in various collections. Anchor Bay Entertainment released all six seasons on DVD in Region 1 between 2002 and 2005. The company also released a 15-episode best-of collection, as well as a collection containing all six seasons. In addition, Anchor Bay released several two-part episodes on single DVDs and edited them together to present them as feature-length films. For example, \"\" and \"\" were released on a single DVD as \"Highlander: Counterfeit\". These releases have all been discontinued and are now out of print.\n\nOn April 3, 2018, Visual Entertainment re-released \"Highlander: The Complete Series\" on DVD in Region 1. The 22-disc collection includes all 119 episodes of the series as well as 6 hours of bonus content and also comes with a bonus Highlander: The Raven.\n\nCritical reaction to \"Highlander: The Series\" has been generally favorable, and more favorable in general than the film sequels to the original \"Highlander\", which have mostly received negative reviews (with the exception of the animated film \"\", which has received more positive reviews).\n\nRob Lineberger of DVD Verdict said, \"The direction is sometimes uncertain, but \"Highlander: The Series\" gives viewers something unique and inspiring. Each episode gives us a provocative glimpse into the trials and concerns of immortality, great swordfights, stylish flashbacks to bygone eras, and occasionally wicked immortals with awesome quickenings.\" Lineberger added, \"These actors, writers, producers, directors, and crew delivered one of television's great successes, particularly in the fantasy genre. \"Highlander: The Series\" took us to places we otherwise could not have gone, and did so with intelligence, style, and wit.\" Lineberger gave the six seasons scores of 92, 93, 90, 92, 87, and 70 out of 100, respectively.\n\nAbbie Bernstein of Audio Video Revolution said, \"Although it would be another two years until the series fully hit its stride, it was already [in the first season] offering something out of the ordinary narratively; in terms of production value, it remains one of the best-looking quasi-period shows ever to come down the pike, holding its own and then some against much better-funded product from the major studios.\" David Oliver of CHUD.com said that \"whereas the sequels ultimately strayed from the mythology of the original [film] in the pursuit of more storytelling (translation: more money), the series built upon the mythology.\"\n\nCarlo Cavagna of About Film criticized the series, saying that it consisted of \"pedestrian one-hour confrontations pitting Duncan MacLeod against one overacting nefarious immortal after another, each a pale imitation of Clancy Brown's delicious overarching villainy in the first film,\" and felt that the series featured \"a wide array of unappealing supporting characters\" and that \"the writers didn't know what to do with the \"Highlander\" concept.\" Similarly, Danél Griffin of Film as Art remarked that \"the six-season \"Highlander: The Series\" has a loyal following, but let’s be honest: Adrian Paul, the lead, is not an interesting actor, and there’s not one moment in the show—not one—that comes close to matching the wit or liveliness of the first film.\"\n\nCritics have pointed to the middle seasons of the show as its best. Lineberger remarked, \"There was a dramatic boost in quality from season one to season two. Season two had better writing and quality control, [and] season three is better than season two.\" Bernstein claimed that \"during season five, [the show] was at the peak of its creative glory.\" Kathie Huddleston of Syfy said that \"season four was arguably the best season of the series, as the show said goodbye to characters from the previous season and delved into what made the regulars and the most notable recurring characters tick.\"\n\nCritics have singled out the sixth and final season as the worst of the series. Lineberger remarked, \"I haven't attempted to hide my disappointment with this season. For the first time ever in my life as a \"Highlander\" enthusiast, I found myself utterly uncaptivated.\" Oliver awarded the sixth season a score of 3.9 out of 10, saying: \"Like \"The X-Files\", \"Highlander: The Series\" simply went on too long. If the star is wanting to get out of a show as much as Paul was ready to hang up his katana, then I say let it go.\"\n\nIn 2008, a reunion special was filmed starring Peter Wingfield, Elizabeth Gracen, and Jim Byrnes reprising their roles. The 17-minute special was a low budget project that takes place 10 years after the series (or between the fourth and fifth movies). Filming took place at producer Peter Davis' former beach home with the actors volunteering in their roles. The plot involved the characters discussing Methos' plans to get married and settle down with a mortal woman and her son.\n\nIn 2009 Big Finish released a series of four audio adventures featuring Adrian Paul as Duncan MacLeod. They are set sometime after the events of Endgame. These are:\n\nEach play in the first season is around an hour long, and contains a new music score and new Highlander audio theme by Jamie Robertson.\n\nIn 2011 Big Finish released a box set containing a linked series of four audio adventures featuring the actors who played the Four Horsemen in the TV series, pitted against a new recurring villain. These are:\n\nBig Finish have indicated that the audio series has now discontinued.\n\nAn opera co-written by Roger Bellon and Harlan Collins was released in 2010. It details a feud that Duncan MacLeod has with an Immortal Visigoth as well as his relationship with a mortal woman named Aurora.\n\nThe ten \"Highlander: The Series\" novels published from October 1995 to September 2000 are canon. Events from them are included in the Watcher Chronicles CD-ROM, which contains an extensive database of the events and immortals of the television series.\n\nA German-language novel entitled \"Highlander: Die Rückkehr des Unsterblichen\" (\"Highlander: The Return of the Immortal\") was also published in 1994. Co-written by Martin Eisele and Hans Sommer, it details Duncan wanting to leave \"The Game\" after he beheads a female Immortal. The book is not considered canonical.\n\nThe series continued in \"\" (2000) and \"\" (2007). The films feature Adrian Paul as Duncan MacLeod, Peter Wingfield as Methos and Jim Byrnes as Joe Dawson.\n\nPlans for a spin-off series led to a group of sixth-season episodes focusing on four new female Immortals to serve as the spinoff's lead. The candidates that were introduced were Alex Raven (Dara Tomanovich), Kyra (Alice Evans), Katya (Justina Vail), and Reagan Cole (Sandra Hess). According to the behind the scene interviews and \"Highlander: The Complete Watcher's Guide\", fan reaction was negative concerning these original characters and so the lead for \"Highlander: The Raven\" went to Elizabeth Gracen reprising her role from the original series as the popular, recurring character Amanda. The spin-off only lasted one season due to low ratings and the change in the marketing of syndicated shows.\n\nThe 2001 \"The Methos Chronicles\" was an animated Internet Flash-series based on Methos, a character drawn from the television series. Peter Wingfield was the voice actor for the main character of the short series, which lasted only one eight-episode season. There was some plan to develop a live-action series in the early 2000s (decade), and Peter Wingfield was willing to participate. However, it never panned out, and Peter Wingfield is now a doctor. Later, eight more episodes of \"The Methos Chronicles\" were produced by fans, and all can be seen on Youtube.\n\nIn the TV series, \"Reaper\", season 1, episode 15 (\"Coming to Grips\"), Bert \"Sock\" Wysocki pretends to be Duncan MacLeod as he wields the scythe \"vessel\" they are going to use to capture the escaped soul; presumably because — like swords in the \"Highlander\" series — it could be used to decapitate someone.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2212867", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2212867", "title": "Detailed balance", "text": "Detailed balance\n\nThe principle of detailed balance can be used in kinetic systems which are decomposed into elementary processes (collisions, or steps, or elementary reactions). It states that at equilibrium, each elementary process is in equilibrium with its reverse process.\n\nThe principle of detailed balance was explicitly introduced for collisions by Ludwig Boltzmann. In 1872, he proved his H-theorem using this principle. The arguments in favor of this property are founded upon microscopic reversibility.\n\nFive years before Boltzmann, James Clerk Maxwell used the principle of detailed balance for gas kinetics with the reference to the principle of sufficient reason. He compared the idea of detailed balance with other types of balancing (like cyclic balance) and found that \"Now it is impossible to assign a reason\" why detailed balance should be rejected (pg. 64).\n\nAlbert Einstein in 1916 used the principle of detailed balance in a background for his quantum theory of emission and absorption of radiation.\n\nIn 1901, Rudolf Wegscheider introduced the principle of detailed balance for chemical kinetics. In particular, he demonstrated that the irreversible cycles <chem>A1 -> A2 -> \\cdots -> A_\\mathit{n} -> A1</chem> are impossible and found explicitly the relations between kinetic constants that follow from the principle of detailed balance. In 1931, Lars Onsager used these relations in his works, for which he was awarded the 1968 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\n\nThe principle of detailed balance has been used in Markov chain Monte Carlo methods since their invention in 1953. In particular, in the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm and in its important particular case, Gibbs sampling, it is used as a simple and reliable condition to provide the desirable equilibrium state.\n\nNow, the principle of detailed balance is a standard part of the university courses in statistical mechanics, physical chemistry, chemical and physical kinetics.\n\nThe microscopic \"reversing of time\" turns at the kinetic level into the \"reversing of arrows\": the elementary processes transform into their reverse processes. For example, the reaction\n\nand conversely. (Here, formula_3 are symbols of components or states, formula_4 are coefficients). The equilibrium ensemble should be invariant with respect to this transformation because of microreversibility and the uniqueness of thermodynamic equilibrium. This leads us immediately to the concept of detailed balance: each process is equilibrated by its reverse process.\n\nThis reasoning is based on three assumptions:\n\nAny of these assumptions may be violated. For example, Boltzmann's collision can be represented as +A_\\mathit{w} -> {A_\\mathit{v'}}+A_\\mathit{w'}</chem>,}} where formula_6 is a particle with velocity \"v\". Under time reversal formula_6 transforms into formula_8. Therefore, the collision is transformed into the reverse collision by the \"PT\" transformation, where \"P\" is the space inversion and \"T\" is the time reversal. Detailed balance for Boltzmann's equation requires \"PT\"-invariance of collisions' dynamics, not just \"T\"-invariance. Indeed, after the time reversal the collision +A_\\mathit{w} -> {A_\\mathit{v'}}+A_\\mathit{w'}</chem>,}} transforms into +A_\\mathit{-w'} -> {A_\\mathit{-v}}+A_\\mathit{-w}</chem>.}} For the detailed balance we need transformation into\n+A_\\mathit{w'} -> {A_\\mathit{v}}+A_\\mathit{w}</chem>.}} For this purpose, we need to apply additionally the space reversal \"P\". Therefore, for the detailed balance in Boltzmann's equation not \"T\"-invariance but \"PT\"-invariance is needed. \n\nEquilibrium may be not \"T\"- or \"PT\"-invariant even if the laws of motion are invariant. This non-invariance may be caused by the spontaneous symmetry breaking. There exist \"nonreciprocal media\" (for example, some bi-isotropic materials) without \"T\" and \"PT\" invariance.\n\nIf different macroscopic processes are sampled from the same elementary microscopic events then macroscopic detailed balance may be violated even when microscopic detailed balance holds.\n\nNow, after almost 150 years of development, the scope of validity and the violations of detailed balance in kinetics seem to be clear.\n\nA Markov process is called a \"reversible Markov process\" or \"reversible Markov chain\" if it satisfies the detailed balance equations. These equations require that the transition probability matrix, \"P\", for the Markov process possess a stationary distribution (i.e. equilibrium probability distribution) π such that\n\nwhere \"P\" is the Markov transition probability from state \"i\" to state \"j\", i.e. , and π and π are the equilibrium probabilities of being in states \"i\" and \"j\", respectively. When for all \"i\", this is equivalent to the joint probability matrix, being symmetric in \"i\" and \"j\"; or symmetric in and \"t\".\n\nThe definition carries over straightforwardly to continuous variables, where π becomes a probability density, and a transition kernel probability density from state \"s\"′ to state \"s\":\n\nThe detailed balance condition is stronger than that required merely for a stationary distribution; that is, there are Markov processes with stationary distributions that do not have detailed balance. Detailed balance implies that, around any closed cycle of states, there is no net flow of probability. For example, it implies that, for all \"a\", \"b\" and \"c\",\n\nThis can be proved by substitution from the definition. In the case of a positive transition matrix, the \"no net flow\" condition implies detailed balance. Indeed, a necessary and sufficient condition for the reversibility condition is Kolmogorov's criterion, which demands that for the reversible chains the product of transition rates over any closed loop of states must be the same in both directions.\n\nTransition matrices that are symmetric or always have detailed balance. In these cases, a uniform distribution over the states is an equilibrium distribution. For continuous systems with detailed balance, it may be possible to continuously transform the coordinates until the equilibrium distribution is uniform, with a transition kernel which then is symmetric. In the case of discrete states, it may be possible to achieve something similar by breaking the Markov states into appropriately-sized degenerate sub-states.\n\nFor many systems of physical and chemical kinetics, detailed balance provides \"sufficient conditions\" for the strict increase of entropy in isolated systems. For example, the famous Boltzmann H-theorem states that, according to the Boltzmann equation, the principle of detailed balance implies positivity of entropy production. The Boltzmann formula (1872) for entropy production in rarefied gas kinetics with detailed balance served as a prototype of many similar formulas for dissipation in mass action kinetics and generalized mass action kinetics with detailed balance.\n\nNevertheless, the principle of detailed balance is not necessary for entropy growth. For example, in the linear irreversible cycle <chem>A1 -> A2 -> A3 -> A1</chem>, entropy production is positive but the principle of detailed balance does not hold.\n\nThus, the principle of detailed balance is a sufficient but not necessary condition for entropy increase in Boltzmann kinetics. These relations between the principle of detailed balance and the second law of thermodynamics were clarified in 1887 when Hendrik Lorentz objected to the Boltzmann H-theorem for polyatomic gases. Lorentz stated that the principle of detailed balance is not applicable to collisions of polyatomic molecules.\n\nBoltzmann immediately invented a new, more general condition sufficient for entropy growth. Boltzmann's condition holds for all Markov processes, irrespective of time-reversibility. Later, entropy increase was proved for all Markov processes by a direct method. These theorems may be considered as simplifications of the Boltzmann result. Later, this condition was referred to as the \"cyclic balance\" condition (because it holds for irreversible cycles) or the \"semi-detailed balance\" or the \"complex balance\". In 1981, Carlo Cercignani and Maria Lampis proved that the Lorentz arguments were wrong and the principle of detailed balance is valid for polyatomic molecules. Nevertheless, the extended semi-detailed balance conditions invented by Boltzmann in this discussion remain the remarkable generalization of the detailed balance.\n\nIn chemical kinetics, the elementary reactions are represented by the stoichiometric equations\n\nwhere formula_5 are the components and formula_14 are the stoichiometric coefficients. Here, the reverse reactions with positive constants are included in the list separately. We need this separation of direct and reverse reactions to apply later the general formalism to the systems with some irreversible reactions. The system of stoichiometric equations of elementary reactions is the \"reaction mechanism\".\n\nThe \"stoichiometric matrix\" is formula_15, formula_16 (gain minus loss). This matrix need not be square. The \"stoichiometric vector\" formula_17 is the \"r\"th row of formula_18 with coordinates formula_16.\n\nAccording to the \"generalized mass action law\", the reaction rate for an elementary reaction is\n\nwhere formula_21 is the activity (the \"effective concentration\") of formula_22.\n\nThe reaction mechanism includes reactions with the reaction rate constants formula_23. For each \"r\" the following notations are used: formula_24; formula_25; formula_26 is the reaction rate constant for the reverse reaction if it is in the reaction mechanism and 0 if it is not; formula_27 is the reaction rate for the reverse reaction if it is in the reaction mechanism and 0 if it is not. For a reversible reaction, formula_28 is the equilibrium constant.\n\nThe principle of detailed balance for the generalized mass action law is: For given values formula_29 there exists a positive equilibrium formula_30 that satisfies detailed balance, that is, formula_31. This means that the system of \"linear\" detailed balance equations\n\nis solvable (formula_33). The following classical result gives the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a positive equilibrium formula_30 with detailed balance (see, for example, the textbook).\n\nTwo conditions are sufficient and necessary for solvability of the system of detailed balance equations:\nthe Wegscheider's identity holds:\n\n\"Remark.\" It is sufficient to use in the Wegscheider conditions a basis of solutions of the system formula_42.\n\nIn particular, for any cycle in the monomolecular (linear) reactions the product of the reaction rate constants in the clockwise direction is equal to the product of the reaction rate constants in the counterclockwise direction. The same condition is valid for the reversible Markov processes (it is equivalent to the \"no net flow\" condition).\n\nA simple nonlinear example gives us a linear cycle supplemented by one nonlinear step: \nThere are two nontrivial independent Wegscheider's identities for this system:\nThey correspond to the following linear relations between the stoichiometric vectors:\n\nThe computational aspect of the Wegscheider conditions was studied by D. Colquhoun with co-authors.\n\nThe Wegscheider conditions demonstrate that whereas the principle of detailed balance states a local property of equilibrium, it implies the relations between the kinetic constants that are valid for all states far from equilibrium. This is possible because a kinetic law is known and relations between the rates of the elementary processes at equilibrium can be transformed into relations between kinetic constants which are used globally. For the Wegscheider conditions this kinetic law is the law of mass action (or the generalized law of mass action).\n\nTo describe dynamics of the systems that obey the generalized mass action law, one has to represent the activities as functions of the concentrations \"c\" and temperature. For this purpose, use the representation of the activity through the chemical potential:\nwhere \"μ\" is the chemical potential of the species under the conditions of interest, is the chemical potential of that species in the chosen standard state, \"R\" is the gas constant and \"T\" is the thermodynamic temperature. \nThe chemical potential can be represented as a function of \"c\" and \"T\", where \"c\" is the vector of concentrations with components \"c\". For the ideal systems, formula_48 and formula_49: the activity is the concentration and the generalized mass action law is the usual law of mass action.\n\nConsider a system in isothermal (\"T\"=const) isochoric (the volume \"V\"=const) condition. For these conditions, the Helmholtz free energy measures the “useful” work obtainable from a system. It is a functions of the temperature \"T\", the volume \"V\" and the amounts of chemical components \"N\" (usually measured in moles), \"N\" is the vector with components \"N\". For the ideal systems, \n\nThe chemical potential is a partial derivative: formula_51.\n\nThe chemical kinetic equations are \n\nIf the principle of detailed balance is valid then for any value of \"T\" there exists a positive point of detailed balance \"c\":\nElementary algebra gives\nwhere formula_55\n\nFor the dissipation we obtain from these formulas:\n\nThe inequality holds because ln is a monotone function and, hence, the expressions formula_57 and formula_58 have always the same sign.\n\nSimilar inequalities are valid for other classical conditions for the closed systems and the corresponding characteristic functions: for isothermal isobaric conditions the Gibbs free energy decreases, for the isochoric systems with the constant internal energy (isolated systems) the entropy increases as well as for isobaric systems with the constant enthalpy.\n\nLet the principle of detailed balance be valid. Then, for small deviations from equilibrium, the kinetic response of the system can be approximated as linearly related to its deviation from chemical equilibrium, giving the reaction rates for the generalized mass action law as:\n\nTherefore, again in the linear response regime near equilibrium, the kinetic equations are (formula_16):\n\nThis is exactly the Onsager form: following the original work of Onsager, we should introduce the thermodynamic forces formula_62 and the matrix of coefficients formula_63 in the form\n\nThe coefficient matrix formula_63 is symmetric: \n\nThese symmetry relations, formula_67, are exactly the Onsager reciprocal relations. The coefficient matrix formula_68 is non-positive. It is negative on the linear span of the stoichiometric vectors formula_69.\n\nSo, the Onsager relations follow from the principle of detailed balance in the linear approximation near equilibrium.\n\nTo formulate the principle of semi-detailed balance, it is convenient to count the direct and inverse elementary reactions separately. In this case, the kinetic equations have the form:\nLet us use the notations formula_71, formula_72 for the input and the output vectors of the stoichiometric coefficients of the \"r\"th elementary reaction. Let formula_73 be the set of all these vectors formula_74.\n\nFor each formula_75, let us define two sets of numbers:\n\nformula_77 if and only if formula_78 is the vector of the input stoichiometric coefficients formula_79 for the \"r\"th elementary reaction;formula_80 if and only if formula_78 is the vector of the output stoichiometric coefficients formula_82 for the \"r\"th elementary reaction.\n\nThe principle of semi-detailed balance means that in equilibrium the semi-detailed balance condition holds: for every formula_75\n\nThe semi-detailed balance condition is sufficient for the stationarity: it implies that \n\nFor the Markov kinetics the semi-detailed balance condition is just the elementary balance equation and holds for any steady state. For the nonlinear mass action law it is, in general, sufficient but not necessary condition for stationarity.\n\nThe semi-detailed balance condition is weaker than the detailed balance one: if the principle of detailed balance holds then the condition of semi-detailed balance also holds.\n\nFor systems that obey the generalized mass action law the semi-detailed balance condition is sufficient for the dissipation inequality formula_86 (for the Helmholtz free energy under isothermal isochoric conditions and for the dissipation inequalities under other classical conditions for the corresponding thermodynamic potentials).\n\nBoltzmann introduced the semi-detailed balance condition for collisions in 1887 and proved that it guaranties the positivity of the entropy production. For chemical kinetics, this condition (as the \"complex balance\" condition) was introduced by Horn and Jackson in 1972.\n\nThe microscopic backgrounds for the semi-detailed balance were found in the Markov microkinetics of the intermediate compounds that are present in small amounts and whose concentrations are in quasiequilibrium with the main components. Under these microscopic assumptions, the semi-detailed balance condition is just the balance equation for the Markov microkinetics according to the \"'Michaelis–Menten–Stueckelberg theorem.\n\nLet us represent the generalized mass action law in the equivalent form: the rate of the elementary process \nis\nwhere formula_89 is the chemical potential and formula_90 is the Helmholtz free energy. The exponential term is called the \"Boltzmann factor\" and the multiplier formula_91 is the kinetic factor.\nLet us count the direct and reverse reaction in the kinetic equation separately:\nAn auxiliary function formula_93 of one variable formula_94 is convenient for the representation of dissipation for the mass action law\nThis function formula_93 may be considered as the sum of the reaction rates for \"deformed\" input stoichiometric coefficients formula_97. For formula_98 it is just the sum of the reaction rates. The function formula_93 is convex because formula_100.\n\nDirect calculation gives that according to the kinetic equations\nThis is \"the general dissipation formula for the generalized mass action law\".\n\nConvexity of formula_93 gives the sufficient and necessary conditions for the proper dissipation inequality:\n\nThe semi-detailed balance condition can be transformed into identity formula_104. Therefore, for the systems with semi-detailed balance formula_105.\n\nDetailed balance states that in equilibrium each elementary process is equilibrated by its reverse process and requires reversibility of all elementary processes. For many real physico-chemical complex systems (e.g. homogeneous combustion, heterogeneous catalytic oxidation, most enzyme reactions etc.), detailed mechanisms include both reversible and irreversible reactions. If one represents irreversible reactions as limits of reversible steps, then it becomes obvious that not all reaction mechanisms with irreversible reactions can be obtained as limits of systems or reversible reactions with detailed balance. For example, the irreversible cycle <chem>A1 -> A2 -> A3 -> A1</chem> cannot be obtained as such a limit but the reaction mechanism <chem>A1 -> A2 -> A3 <- A1</chem> can.\n\nGorban–Yablonsky theorem. \"A system of reactions with some irreversible reactions is a limit of systems with detailed balance when some constants tend to zero if and only if (i) the reversible part of this system satisfies the principle of detailed balance and (ii) the convex hull of the stoichiometric vectors of the irreversible reactions has empty intersection with the linear span of the stoichiometric vectors of the reversible reactions.\" Physically, the last condition means that the irreversible reactions cannot be included in oriented cyclic pathways.\n\n"}

He was the Distinguished Service Professor of Psychology, Psychoanalysis and Spirituality at the Chicago Theological Seminary; a training analyst at the C.G. Jung Institute of Chicago; and director of research for the Institute for the Science of Psychoanalysis. Author and editor of numerous books in psychology and spirituality, he lectured internationally on his formulation of a Neo-Jungian paradigm for psychotherapy and psychoanalysis. He was working on \"Structural Psychoanalysis and Integrative Psychotherapy: A Neo-Jungian Paradigm\" at the time of his death. He also murdered his wife, Dr. Margaret Shanahan, in a 2016 murder-suicide. \n\nRobert Louis Moore was born on August 13, 1942. His parents were Golden Franklin Moore, Sr., and Margaret DePriest Moore. Moore has characterized his roots as \"Cajun Catholic, Russian Jewish, and Scotch-Irish Protestant\". He was married to Margaret Shanahan and lived in Chicago.\n\nHis education was extensive: 1964: B.A., Hendrix College (Religion/Behavioral Science); 1967: M.Th., Southern Methodist University (Psychology and Theology); 1968: M.Th., Duke University (Counseling Psychology and Religion); 1970: M.A., University of Chicago (Psychology and Religion); 1975: Ph.D., University of Chicago (Psychology and Religion); 1983: Diplomate, Adler Institute (Adlerian Psychoanalysis)); 1987: Diplomate, C. G. Jung Institute (Jungian Psychoanalysis). Moore was deeply impressed with three University of Chicago professors, Mircea Eliade, Victor Turner, and Paul Tillich.\n\nHis employment history shows that he found a home at the Chicago Theological Seminary: 1973-1977: Western Illinois University, Assistant Professor of Philosophy and Religious Studies; 1977-1979: Chicago Theological Seminary, Assistant Professor of Psychology and Religion; 1979-1982: Associate Professor of Psychology and Religion; 1982-2005: Professor of Psychology, Psychoanalysis, and Spirituality; 2005–2016: Distinguished Service Professor of Psychology, Psychoanalysis, and Spirituality.\n\nHe was also employed from 1973 to 2016 in the private practice of psychotherapy; and from 1983 to 2016 in the private practice of psychoanalysis and as a consultant in organizational development and leadership and personal coaching.\n\nAs a psychoanalytic scientist, Moore worked on decoding and mapping the deep structures of the human self. His work on ritual process and the masculine psyche is today in the forefront of theory in masculine psychology, spirituality, and initiation.\n\nThe men's movement in the United States received a certain amount of notoriety for the practice of drumming. This practice needs to be understood in terms of ritual processes. Many of our human ancestors worked out ritual processes, some of which did involve drumming and dancing and singing. From his cross-cultural study of ritual processes, Moore became convinced of the value of ritual process in actuating human potential. More specifically, he became convinced that ritual processes at their best can provide liminal experiences for certain participants that are instrumental in enabling those participants to actuate the potential of archetypal sources of energy (that is, sources of energy at the archetypal level of the human psyche).\n\nMoore's views regarding ritual processes can be found in the transcribed lectures and essays published in \"The Archetype of Initiation: Sacred Space, Ritual Process, and Personal Transformation\" (2001), discussed below.\n\nIn addition to writing and editing numerous books, Moore frequently gave short courses at the C. G. Jung Institute of Chicago, many of which are available from the institute on audiotapes.\n\nMoore is probably most widely known as the senior author, with Douglas Gillette, of a series of five books on the in-depth structure of the male psyche, drawing on the account of the archetypal level of the human psyche developed by C. G. Jung.\n\nAccording to Moore and Gillette, for each optimal orientation for each of these four key sources of energy, there are two corresponding \"shadow\" forms of the source of the energy—two ways for each of them to be misdirected for only one healthy or optimal way for each of them to be oriented. Just as the authors have given four key sources of energy in the human psyche very colorful names that seem to personify each source, so too the authors give each of the bipolar \"shadow\" forms very colorful names that seem to personify them.\n\nEven though Moore stresses the positive potential of the archetypes of maturity, as he styles the healthy forms of the archetypes (as distinct from the \"shadow\" forms), he also stresses that archetypes are not friendly. By this he means that they can be dangerous because they can take over a person. So they are best approached with caution.\n\nMoore has also noted that various forms of masculine behavior are immature, and so he thinks it is important for men today to develop guidelines for directing their own personal development and decision making.\n\nThe 21st century has seen the publication of three new books by Moore that carry forward certain dimensions of his thought:\n\n\n\n\n\nMoore also edited, or served as series editor of, a number of books in the Jung and Spirituality Series published by Paulist Press.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2212880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2212880", "title": "Selenography", "text": "Selenography\n\nSelenography is the study of the surface and physical features of the Moon. Historically, the principal concern of selenographists was the mapping and naming of the lunar maria, craters, mountain ranges, and other various features. This task was largely finished when high resolution images of the near and far sides of the Moon were obtained by orbiting spacecraft during the early space era. Nevertheless, some regions of the Moon remain poorly imaged (especially near the poles) and the exact locations of many features (like crater depths) are uncertain by several kilometers. Today, selenography is considered to be a subdiscipline of selenology, which itself is most often referred to as simply \"lunar science.\" The word selenography is derived from the Greek lunar deity Σελήνη \"Selene\" and γράφω graphō, \"I write\".\n\nThe idea that the Moon is not perfectly smooth originates to at least , when Democritus asserted that the Moon's \"lofty mountains and hollow valleys\" were the cause of its markings. However, not until the end of the 15th century AD did serious study of selenography began. Around AD 1603, William Gilbert made the first lunar drawing based on naked-eye observation. Others soon followed, and when the telescope was invented, initial drawings of poor accuracy were made, but soon thereafter improved in tandem with optics. In the early 18th century, the librations of the Moon were measured, which revealed that more than half of the lunar surface was visible to observers on Earth. In 1750, Johann Meyer produced the first reliable set of lunar coordinates that permitted astronomers to locate lunar features. \n\nLunar mapping became systematic in 1779 when Johann Schröter began meticulous observation and measurement of lunar topography. In 1834 Johann Heinrich von Mädler published the first large cartograph (map) of the Moon, comprising 4 sheets in size, and he subsequently published \"The Universal Selenography\". All lunar measurement was based on direct observation until March 1840, when J.W. Draper, using a 5 inch reflector, produced a daguerreotype of the Moon and thus introduced photography to astronomy. At first, the images were of very poor quality, but as with the telescope 200 years earlier, their quality rapidly improved. By 1890 lunar photography had become a recognized subdiscipline of astronomy.\n\nThe 20th century witnessed more advances in selenography. In 1959, the Soviet spacecraft Luna 3 transmitted the first photographs of the far side of the Moon, giving the first view of it in history. The United States of America launched the Ranger spacecraft between 1961 and 1965 to photograph the lunar surface until the instant they impacted it, the Lunar Orbiters between 1966 and 1967 to photograph the Moon from orbit, and the Surveyors between 1966 and 1968 to photograph and softly land on the lunar surface. The Soviet Lunokhods 1 (1970) and 2 (1973) traversed almost 50 km of the lunar surface, making detailed photographs of the lunar surface. The Clementine spacecraft obtained the first nearly global cartograph (map) of the lunar topography, and also multispectral images. Successive missions transmitted photographs of increasing resolution.\n\nThe oldest known illustration of the Moon was found in a passage grave in Knowth, County Meath, Ireland. The tomb was carbon dated to 3330–2790 BC. Leonardo da Vinci made and annotated some sketches of the Moon in c. 1500. William Gilbert made a drawing of the Moon in which he denominated a dozen surface features in the late 16th century; it was published posthumously In \"De Mondo Nostro Sublunari Philosophia Nova\". After the invention of the telescope, Thomas Harriot (1609), Galileo Galilei (1609), and Charles Scheiner (1614) made drawings also.\n\nThe first serious denominations of the surface features of the Moon, based on telescopic observation, were made by Michel Florent van Langren in 1645. His work is considered the first true cartograph (map) of the Moon because it demarcated the various lunar maria, craters, and mountains and ranges. Many of his denominations were distinctly Catholic, denominating craters in honor of Catholic royalty and capes and promontories in honor of Catholic saints. The lunar \"maria\" were denominated in Latin for terrestrial seas and oceans. Minor craters were denominated in honor of astronomers, mathematicians, and other famous scholars.\n\nIn 1647, Johannes Hevelius produced the rival work \"Selenographia\", which was the first lunar atlas. Hevelius ignored the nomenclature of Van Langren and instead denominated the lunar topography according to terrestrial features, such that the names of lunar features corresponded to the toponyms of their geographical terrestrial counterparts, especially as the latter were denominated by the ancient Roman and Greek civilizations. This work of Hevelius influenced his contemporary European astronomers, and the \"Selenographia\" was the standard reference on selenography for over a century.\n\nGiambattista Riccioli, SJ, a Catholic priest and scholar who lived in northern Italy authored the present scheme of Latin lunar nomenclature. His \"Almagestum Novum\" was published in 1651 as summary of then current astronomical thinking and recent developments. In particular he outlined the arguments in favor of and against various cosmological models, both heliocentric and geocentric. \"Almagestum Novum\" contained scientific reference matter based on contemporary knowledge, and contemporary educators across Europe widely used it. Although this handbook of astronomy has long since been superseded, its system of lunar nomenclature is used even today.\n\nThe lunar illustrations in the \"Almagestum Novum\" were drawn by a fellow Jesuit educator named Francesco Grimaldi, SJ. The nomenclature was based on a subdivision of the visible lunar surface into octants that were numbered in Roman style from I to VIII. Octant I referenced the northwest section and subsequent octants proceeded clockwise in alignment with compass directions. Thus Octant VI was to the south and included Clavius and Tycho Craters.\n\nThe Latin nomenclature had 2 components: the first denominated the broad features of \"terrae\" (lands) and \"maria\" (seas) and the second denominated the craters. Riccioli authored lunar toponyms derived from the names of various conditions, including climactic ones, whose causes were historically attributed to the Moon. Thus there were the seas of crises (\"Mare Crisium\"), serenity (\"Mare Serenitatis\"), and fertility (\"Mare Fecunditatis\"). There were also the seas of rain (\"Mare Imbrium\"), clouds (\"Mare Nubium\"), and cold (\"Mare Frigoris\"). The topographical features between the \"maria\" were comparably denominated, but were opposite the toponyms of the \"maria\". Thus there were the lands of sterility (\"Terra Sterilitatis\"), heat (\"Terra Caloris\"), and life (\"Terra Vitae\"). However, these names for the highland regions were supplanted on later cartographs (maps). See List of features on the Moon#Terra for a complete list.\nMany of the craters were denominated topically pursuant to the octant in which they were located. Craters in Octants I, II, and III were primarily denominated based on names from ancient Greece, such as Plato, Atlas, and Archimedes. Toward the middle in Octants IV, V, and VI craters were denominated based on names from the ancient Roman Empire, such as Julius Caesar, Tacitus, and Taruntius. Toward the southern half of the lunar cartograph (map) craters were denominated in honor of scholars, writers, and philosophers of medieval Europe and Arabic regions. The outer extremes of Octants V, VI, and VII, and all of Octant VIII were denominated in honor of contemporaries of Giambattista Riccioli. Features of Octant VIII were also denominated in honor of Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo. These persons were \"banished\" to it far from the \"ancients\", as a gesture to the Catholic Church. Many craters around the Mare Nectaris were denominated in honor of Catholic saints pursuant to the nomenclature of Van Langren. All of them were, however, connected in some mode with astronomy. Later cartographs (maps) removed the \"St.\" from their toponyms.\n\nThe lunar nomenclature of Giambattista Riccioli was widely used after the publication of his \"Almagestum Novum\", and many of its toponyms are presently used. The system was scientifically inclusive and was considered eloquent and poetic in style, and therefore it appealed widely to his contemporaries. It was also readily extensible with new toponyms for additional features. Thus it replaced the nomenclature of Van Langren and Hevelius.\n\nLater astronomers and lunar cartographers augmented the nomenclature with additional toponyms. The most notable among these contributors was Johann H. Schröter, who published a very detailed cartograph (map) of the Moon in 1791 titled the \"Selenotopografisches Fragmenten\". Schröter's adoption of Riccioli's nomenclature perpetuated it as the universally standard lunar nomenclature. A vote of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 1935 established the lunar nomenclature of Riccioli, which included 600 lunar toponyms, as universally official and doctrinal.\n\nThe IAU later expanded and updated the lunar nomenclature in the 1960s, but new toponyms were limited to toponyms honoring deceased scientists. After Soviet spacecraft photographed the far side of the Moon, many of the newly discovered features were denominated in honor of Soviet scientists and engineers. The IAU assigned all subsequent new lunar toponyms. Some craters were denominated in honor of space explorers.\n\nJohann H. Mädler authored the nomenclature for satellite craters. The subsidiary craters surrounding a major crater were identified by a letter. These subsidiary craters were usually smaller than the crater with which they were associated, with some exceptions. The craters could be assigned letters \"A\" through \"Z\", with \"I\" omitted. Because the great majority of the toponyms of craters were masculine, the major craters were generically denominated \"patronymic\" craters.\n\nThe assignment of the letters to satellite craters was originally somewhat haphazard. Letters were typically assigned to craters in by order of significance rather than location. Precedence depended on the angle of illumination from the Sun at the time of the telescopic observation, which could change during the lunar day. In many cases the assignments were seemingly random. In a number of cases the satellite crater was located closer to a major crater with which it was not associated. To identify the patronymic crater, Mädler placed the identifying letter to the side of the midpoint of the feature that was closest to the associated major crater. This also had the advantage of permitting omission of the toponyms of the major craters from the cartographs (maps) when their subsidiary features were labelled.\n\nOver time, lunar observers assigned many of the satellite craters an eponym. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) assumed authority to denominate lunar features in 1919. The commission for denominating these features formally adopted the convention of using capital Roman letters to identify craters and valleys.\n\nWhen suitable cartographs (maps) of the far side of the Moon became available by 1966, Ewen A. Whitaker denominated satellite features based on the angle of their location relative to the major crater with which they were associated. A satellite crater located due north of the major crater was identified as \"Z\". The full 360° circle around the major crater was then subdivided evenly into 24 parts, like a 24-hour clock. Each \"hour\" angle, running clockwise, was assigned a letter, beginning with \"A\" at 1 o'clock. The letters \"I\" and \"O\" were omitted, resulting in only 24 letters. Thus a crater due south of its major crater was identified as \"M\".\n\nThe Moon obviously lacks any sea level. The USGS's Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA), an instrument on NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), employs a digital elevation model (DEM) that uses the lunar reference radius of .\n\nThe following is a list of historically-notable lunar\nmaps and atlases, arranged in chronological order by\npublication date.\n\n\n\n"}

The word \"churchmanship\" itself was first used in 1680 to refer to the attitude of these supporters but later acquired its modern meaning. While many Anglicans are content to label their own churchmanship, not all Anglicans would feel happy to be described as anything but \"Anglican\" . Today, in official contexts, the gender-neutral term \"tradition\" is preferred.\n\n\"High\" and \"Low\", the oldest labels, date from the late 17th century and originally described opposing political attitudes to the relation between the Church of England and the civil power. Their meaning shifted as historical settings changed and, towards the end of the 19th century, they had come to be used to describe different views on the ceremonies to be used in worship. Shortly after the introduction of the \"High/Low\" distinction a section of the \"Low\" Church was nicknamed Latitudinarian because of its relative indifference to doctrinal definition. In the 19th century this group gave birth to the Broad Church which, in turn, produced the \"Modernist\" movement of the first half of the 20th century. Today, the \"parties\" are usually thought of as Anglo-Catholics, evangelical Anglicans, and Liberals and, with the exception of \"High Church\", the remaining terms are mainly used to refer to past history. The precise shades of meaning of any term vary from user to user and mixed descriptions such as liberal-catholic are found. Today \"Broad Church\" may be used in a sense that differs from the historical one mentioned above and identifies Anglicans who are neither markedly high, nor low/evangelical nor liberal .\n\nIt is an Anglican commonplace to say that authority in the church has three sources: Scripture, Reason and Tradition. In general, the Low churchman and the Evangelical tends to put more emphasis upon Scripture, the Broad churchman and the Liberal upon reason and the High churchman and/or Anglo-Catholic upon tradition (; ). The emphasis on \"parties\" and differences is necessary but in itself gives an incomplete picture. Cyril Garbett (later Archbishop of York) wrote of his coming to the Diocese of Southwark:\n\nand William Gibson commented that\nA traditional poem to describe churchmanship is \"Low and Lazy, Broad and Hazy, and High and Crazy.\" Lazy refers to simpler worship, hazy to unclear tradition or beliefs, and crazy to excessive ceremonialism.\n\nSometimes the concept of churchmanship has been extended to other denominations. In Lutheran churches it can be liberal Protestant, pietist, confessional Lutheran, or evangelical Catholic.\n\n\n"}

With Baron Scrope, in 1726, he drew up an \"Historical View of the Forms and Powers of the Court of Exchequer in Scotland\", which was printed at the expense of the Barons of Exchequer for private circulation.\n\nA leading supporter of the Act of Union 1707 with the Kingdom of England, Clerk wrote in his memoirs of English novelist, journalist and secret agent Daniel Defoe that it was not known at the time that Defoe had been sent by Godolphin : \"... to give a faithful account to him from time to time how everything past here. He was therefor a spy among us, but not known to be such, otherways the Mob of Edin. had pull him to pieces\".\n\nOf his other treatises, Clerk wrote papers in the \"Philosophical Transactions\": one an \"Account of the Stylus of the Ancients and their different sorts of Paper\", printed in 1731, and the others \"On the effects of Thunder on Trees\" and \"Of a large Deer's Horns found in the heart of an Oak\", printed in 1739. He was the author of a tract entitled \"Dissertatio de quibusdam Monumentis Romanis &c\", written in 1730 but not published until 1750. For upwards of twenty years he also carried on a learned correspondence with Roger Gale, the English antiquary, which forms a portion of the \"Reliquiae Britannica\" of 1782.\n\nSir John Clerk was one of the friends and patrons of the poet Allan Ramsay who, during his latter years, spent much of his time at Penicuik House. His son, Sir James Clerk, erected at the family seat an obelisk to Ramsay's memory. Sir John was a patron to various other artists and architects, and even dabbled in architecture himself.\n\nClerk had a musical bent also, and while in Rome may have been tutored by the Baroque composer Arcangelo Corelli, but his own work has often been overlooked, primarily since the only record of his composition seems to be his own papers. One of his humorous songs was \"O merry may the maid be that marries the miller\".\n\nSir John succeeded his father in his title and estates in 1722. He unsuccessfully courted Susanna, daughter of Sir Archibald Kennedy of Culzean, Baronet (ancestor of the Marquess of Ailsa) and that correspondence is in the National Archives. She became the third wife of Alexander, 9th Earl of Eglinton.\n\nHe married, firstly, on 23 February 1701, Lady Margaret, eldest daughter of Alexander Stewart, 3rd Earl of Galloway who died in childbirth on 26 December that year. Her son, John, survived, but died unmarried in 1722. Sir John married again, to Janet, daughter of Sir John Inglis of Cramond, by whom he had seven sons and six daughters.

He was born in Morayshire in 1838.\n\nAfter studying at the University of Aberdeen from 1854 to 1857, he went to Edinburgh, and after hearing a course of lectures by (Sir) William Howard Russell, the famous correspondent, he enlisted in the Royal Dragoons. While still a trooper he began writing for the \"Morning Star\", and succeeded in getting several papers on military subjects accepted by the \"Cornhill Magazine\".\n\nOn being invalided from the army in 1867, he started and ran with very little external aid a weekly journal called the \"London Scotsman\" (1867–71). \nHis chance as a journalist came when in September 1870 he was despatched to the siege of Metz by the \"Morning Advertiser\" (from which paper, however, his services were transferred after a short period to the \"Daily News\"). In all the previous reports from battlefields comparatively sparing use had been made of the telegraph.\n\nForbes laments his own supineness in the matter of wiring full details from the scene of operations. But the intensity of competition rapidly developed the long war telegram during the autumn of 1870, and no one contributed more effectively to this result than Forbes. He witnessed many of the events of the autumn campaign and entered Paris with the Prussians (with whom he established excellent relations) on 1 March 1871. On this occasion he was nearly drowned in a Parisian fountain as a German spy by an enthusiastic French mob. He managed to arrive first in England with his account of the Prussian entry. Two months later he returned to Paris and witnessed the horrors of the commune with the \"sang froid\" for which he became celebrated.\n\nIn 1873, he represented the \"Daily News\" at the Vienna exhibition; subsequently he saw fighting in Spain, both with the Carlists and their opponents ; and in 1875 he accompanied the Prince of Wales on his visit to India. In 1876, he was with Michael Gregorovitch Tchernaieff and the Russian volunteers in the Serbian campaign of 1876. In 1877, he witnessed the Russian invasion of Turkey, and on 23 August was presented to Alexander II at Gornic Studen as the bearer of important news from the Schipka Pass. On this occasion, the emperor conferred upon him the order of St. Stanislaus for his services to the Russian soldiers before Plevna. During 1878, after a brief visit to Cyprus to witness the British occupation, he lectured in England upon the Russo-Turkish war. In 1878-9 he went out to Afghanistan, and accompanied the Khyber Pass force to Jellalabad. He was present at the capture of Ali Musjid, and marched with several expeditions against the hill tribes.\n\nFrom Afghanistan, he went to Mandalay and had interviews with Thibaw Min. In 1880, he was with Lord Chelmsford as a British force was preparing for the Zulu war. On 5 July, after the victory of Ulundi, he rode 110 miles to Landman's Drift in twenty hours. Two days after his arrival there he appeared in a state of utter exhaustion before Pietermaritzburg, having ridden by way of Ladysmith and Estcourt, an additional 170 miles, in thirty-five hours.\nThe news of Ulundi first reached England through his agency, he having completely outpaced the official despatch rider. He put in a claim for the Avar medal on the strength of this piece of service, but the request was refused with scant courtesy by the war office. \n\nSome of his criticisms of Lord Chelmsford were held in certain quarters to have been unnecessarily offensive. Forbes had seen war practically illustrated in all quarters of the globe, and he had outgrown any semblance of diffidence in passing judgment upon difficult military operations.\n\nForbes had already published several volumes of \"Daily News\" war correspondence. That relating to 1870–1 was widely circulated. During his later years he collected a quantity of his various material and published it in book form. In 1884, upon the occasion of Gordon's mission to the Sudan, he brought out a tolerable sketch of his career, \"Chinese Gordon\" (13th edit. 1886). This was followed by a volume of military sketches and tales, \"Barracks, Bivouacs, and Battles\" (1891), and a brief tableau of \"The Afghan Wars\" of 1839 and 1879 (1892, 8vo). Then came a version of Moltke's \"Franco-German War\" ('revised by A. Forbes,' 1893), and \"The Great War of 189-,\" a cleverly written forecast, in which Forbes collaborated with a number of other experts and special correspondents, such as Admiral Philip Howard Colomb, Colonel (Sir) Frederick Maurice, and others. In 1895, appeared the best volume of Forbes's autobiographical sketches, \"Memories and Studies of War and Peace.\"\n\nIn this he claimed, among \"The Soldiers I have known\", Helmuth von Moltke the Younger, Ulysses S. Grant, Sherman, Robert Napier, Mikhail Skobelev, Osman Pasha, Sir Redvers Buller, and Lords Wolseley and Roberts. His readiness to prophesy no less than to judge suggests a rashness in forming opinions, inseparable perhaps from the profession that he followed; but he has some good stories, such as the one of General Skobeleff arresting his father (a miserly parent) for reporting himself in undress uniform. In 1896, Forbes collaborated in two handsome but ill-arranged quarto volumes of \"Battles of the Nineteenth Century,\" and in the same year published his historical record of \"The Black Watch.\" \nIn 1898, he committed to the press a superficial \"Life of Napoleon III\" (with portraits), based to a large extent upon the \"Life\" by Blanchard Jerrold. Previous biographies by Forbes of similar calibre were those of the \"Emperor William II\" (1889), \"Havelock\" (1890), and \"Colin Campbell, Lord Clyde\" (1895, \"Men of Action\" series).\nAfter a life of perilous adventure, Forbes died peacefully at Clarence Terrace, Regent's Park, on 30 March 1900, and he was buried in the Allenvale cemetery, near Aberdeen.\n\nHe left a widow, Louisa, daughter of Montgomery C. Meigs.\n\nA portrait of Forbes is prefixed to his \"Memories and Studies\" (1895). A tablet with a medallion portrait was unveiled in the crypt of St. Paul's Cathedral in May 1902 by Field Marshal Viscount Wolseley.\n\n\n"}

Albeit a short man, he was exceptionally strong; when a captured enemy officer, particularly a Pole or an Austrian was led into the Swedish camp, he would shake their hands so hard that blood would appear under their fingernails in what he called \"an honest Swedish handshake\". Hence, his nickname.\n\nStålhandske started his military career as a squire to Patrick Ruthwen, with whom he had a task of recruiting military in Scotland. He followed Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden to Prussia, as an Ensign in his Personal guard in 1626. In the same year he was promoted to the rank of Major in the Regiment of Arvid Horn. In 1627 he joined the cavalry led by Åke Henriksson Tott.\n\nIn 1629 he was promoted to Lieutenant-colonel in the \"Nylands och Tavastehus\" Cavalry regiment, leading Finnish horsemen, also known as \"Hakkapeliitat\", for the first time into the Thirty Years' War. At the Battle of Breitenfeld (1631) they rode with the right wing personally led by King Gustavus Adolphus. In 1632 he was promoted to the rank of Colonel. At the siege of Nuremberg he assaulted the \"invincible warriors\" of Austrian Colonel Cronberg and, thanks to his mighty and successful charges, largely determined the outcome of the Battle of Lützen, where Gustavus Adolphus was killed, the battle was nonetheless won.\n\nIn June 1634, Stålhandske was wounded at the Battle of Hamelin. In 1635, a Major-general, he joined the main army led by Banér. At the Battle of Wittstock he personally captured 35 flags and, at a critical juncture of the battle, forced the enemy to flee. Similarly, he distinguished himself at the Battle of Chemnitz as well as in Silesia, where he defended his positions during the whole year of 1640 against Count Mansfeld.\n\nFinally, in April 1642, he joined his forces with Torstenson's Army and took part in the Second Battle of Breitenfeld (also known as the First Battle of Leipzig), where he was seriously wounded. In May he was appointed general in Chief of the Cavalry. In 1643 Stålhandske followed Torstenson in Bohemia. In 1644 he crushed a hostile army corps in the Jutland, but then fell ill and died in Haderslev on 21 April 1644.\n\nTorsten Stålhandske's mausoleum can be seen in the Cathedral of Turku (Finland).\n"}

With over 147,000 students enrolled, it is the second-largest school district in North Carolina and the eighteenth-largest in the nation. The system is best known nationally for its role as the respondent in the landmark 1971 Supreme Court decision \"Swann\" v. \"Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools\".\n\nIn 2016 the nine board members all voted to create a magnet school program in which different socioeconomic groups would be integrated.\n\nThe Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, or school board, consists of 9 members—3 at-large and 6 from districts. Before 1995, the board had been elected entirely on an at-large basis, but this was changed after it was discovered nearly all of the board members lived in the eastern part of the county. Members serve staggered four-year terms; the at-large members are elected in the year before presidential elections and the district members are elected in the year after presidential elections. Although school board elections are nonpartisan, the district members are elected from the same districts as the county commissioners.\n\n\n\nCMS operates 21 high schools, not including alternative schools or \"schools-within-a-school\". Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools also operates the top 3 largest high schools in the state of North Carolina; Myers Park High School has 3,417, Ardrey Kell High School has 3,315, and South Mecklenburg High School has 3,125 students in attendance. The following is a list of those high schools, divided by geographical region of the City of Charlotte, along with the year opened and mascot:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCMS operates 32 middle schools\n\nCMS also operates 106 elementary schools.\n\nThe International Baccalaureate (IB) Program is offered at many schools.\n\nSeveral CMS high schools have been recognized by Newsweek as being among the 100 best high schools in the United States, a statistic based on the number of advanced classes that are offered to students.\n\nDuring the 2006–2007 school year CMS students received $43.5 million in academic merit-based financial aid from universities and other organizations, and $12.1 million in athletic scholarships.\n\nIn May 2005, Wake County Superior Court Judge Howard Manning Jr. issued a ruling in which he accused CMS of \"academic genocide\" against at-risk, low-income students in low-scoring high schools. Since the debut of its new student assignment plan in 2002, and the end of its court-ordered busing program, CMS has seen an increase in concentrations of poverty, with schools that have student-poverty rates of at least 75 percent at twice the number they were before. In the same year, Judge Manning also threatened to close 4 of the lowest performing high schools, Garinger, Waddell, West Charlotte and West Mecklenburg. Many teachers and parents felt he had gone too far, and, in the end, this never occurred as the 4 high schools presented turnaround plans and their principals were deemed capable of carrying them out. The high schools are now included in a special Achievement Zone.\n\n56% of voters rejected a $427 million bond package in 2005 to improve facilities and build new schools for the first time in a decade. Dissenters cited spats between members of the school board and other well-publicized events that year hurting their confidence in the district's ability to spend money effectively. A$516 million bond package was backed by 68% of voters in November 2007.\n\nCalls for decentralization mounted in 2005 as dissatisfaction with CMS grew, with some wanting CMS broken up into smaller school systems. One notable incarnation of this movement was called DUMP (Don't Underestimate Mecklenburg Parents) CMS. This effort abated when the Board of Education requested and newly hired Superintendent Peter Gorman outlined a plan for decentralization, with the stated goal of putting resources and administration closer to parents and other members of the public. Regional offices known as \"learning communities\", each with an area superintendent, were implemented in the 2007–2008 school year.\n\n"}

There also seems to be a bit of sadness, but not necessarily despair.\"\n\nAllMusic's Matt Collar stated the album \"plays like a K-Tel commercial for Gen X sad-sackism\", calling it \"pretty cool\". Brian Howe of Pitchfork wrote \"for the most part, the songs [Lytle] selected sound quite a bit like his own band. Lush yet sleek and slightly sterile is the dominant style of \"Below the Radio\"\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2212957", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2212957", "title": "Paleopathology", "text": "Paleopathology\n\nPaleopathology, also spelled palaeopathology, is the study of ancient diseases. Studying pathologies, these abnormalities in biologic individuals and systems, may be intrinsic to the system itself (examples: autoimmune disorders or traumatic arthritis) or caused by an extrinsic factor (examples: viruses or lead poisoning from pipes). Any living organism can have pathology. Studies have historically focused on humans, but there is no evidence that humans are more prone to pathologies than any other animal.\n\nPaleopathology is an interdisciplinary science. The majority of the work has historically been done by anthropologists studying diseases in ancient cultures. Medically trained professionals have also made substantial contributions, especially in modern comparative studies. Paleontologists have sporadically contributed to the field, focusing on non-avian dinosaurs and Cenozoic mammals.\n\nHumans have always been interested in deviations from health. Ancient texts that are thousands of years old record instances of diseases such as leprosy. Historically, disease has often been correlated with morality, but this view has gradually given way to modern disease theory.\n\nFrom the Renaissance to the mid-nineteenth century, there was increasing reference to ancient disease, initially within prehistoric animals although later the importance of studying the antiquity of human disease began to be emphasized. The true genesis of the field of human palaeopathology is generally considered to have occurred between the mid nineteenth century and World War I. During this period a number of pioneering physicians and anthropologists, such as Marc Armand Ruffer, G. Elliot Smith, Frederic Wood Jones, Douglas E. Derry, and Samuel George Shattock, clarified the medical nature of ancient skeletal pathologies. This clarification included a review of human paleopathology published by H.U. Williams in 1929 and a book published by Pales in 1930 on paleopathology and comparative pathology. This work was consolidated between the world wars with methods such as radiology, histology and serology being applied more frequently, improving diagnosis and accuracy with the introduction of statistical analysis. It was at this point that palaeopathology can truly be considered to have become a scientific discipline.\n\nAfter World War II palaeopathology began to be viewed in a different way: as an important tool for the understanding of past populations, and it was at this stage that the discipline began to be related to epidemiology and demography.\n\nNew techniques in molecular biology also began to add new information to what was already known about ancient disease, as it became possible to retrieve DNA from samples that were centuries or millennia old.\n\nHuman osteopathology is classified into several general groups:\n\nWhilst traumatic injuries such as broken and malformed bones can be easy to spot, evidence of other conditions, for example infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and syphilis, can also be found in bones. Arthropathies, that is joint diseases such as osteoarthritis and gout, are also not uncommon.\n\nThe first exhaustive reference of human paleopathology evidence in skeletal tissue was published in 1976 by Ortner & Putschar. In identifying pathologies, physical anthropologists rely heavily on good archaeological documentation regarding location, age of site and other environmental factors. These provide the foundation on which further analysis is built and are required for accurate populations studies. From there, the paleopathology researcher determines a number of key biological indicators on the specimen including age and sex. These provide a foundation for further analysis of bone material and evaluation of lesions or other anomalies identified.\n\nArchaeologists increasingly use paleopathology as an important main tool for understanding the lives of ancient peoples. For example, cranial deformation is evident in the skulls of the Maya, where a straight line between nose and forehead may have been preferred over an angle or slope. There is also evidence for trepanation, or drilling holes in the cranium, either singly or several times in a single individual. Partially or completely healed trepanations indicate that this procedure was often survived. The 10,000 year-old human remains discovered at the site of Nataruk in Turkana, Kenya, reportedly show extreme traumatic lesions to the head, neck, ribs, knees and hands, including embedded stone projectiles, and they may represent the earliest evidence of inter-group conflict between hunter-gatherers in the past.\n\nSeveral diseases are present in the archaeological record. Through archaeological evaluation these diseases can be identified and sometimes can explain the cause of death for certain individuals. Aside from looking at sex, age, etc. of a skeleton, a paleopathologist may analyze the condition of the bones to determine what sort of diseases the individual may have. The goal of a forensic anthropologist looking at the Paleopathology of certain diseases is to determine if the disease they are researching are still present over time, with the occurrence of certain events, or if this disease still exists today and why this disease may not exist today. Some disease that are found based on changes in bone include\n\nApart from bones, molecular biology has also been used as a tool of paleopathology over the last few decades, as DNA can be recovered from human remains that are hundreds of years old. Since techniques such as PCR are highly sensitive to contamination, meticulous laboratory set-ups and protocols such as \"suicide\" PCR are necessary to ensure that false positive results from other materials in the laboratory do not occur.\n\nFor example, the long-held assumption that bubonic plague was the cause of the Justinian plague and the Black Death has been strongly supported by finding \"Yersinia pestis\" DNA in mass graves, whereas another proposed cause, anthrax, was not found.\n\nSome diseases are difficult to evaluate in the archaeology, however, tuberculosis can be found and dates as far back as the Neolithic period. Tuberculosis is presumed to have been transmitted from domesticated cattle to humans through ingestion of contaminated meats and the drinking of contaminated milk. It is also possible to contract tuberculosis through contact with infected persons. When an infected person coughs, they eject infected mucus from their body which can possibly infect those close by. There are several types of tuberculosis: the kind that affects cold-blooded animals, the kind that affects birds, and the bovine type that causes disease in humans. Because bovine tuberculosis is often found in children, it may be that the disease is spread through the consumption of contaminated milk.\n\nTuberculosis manifests itself in the archaeological record through DNA extraction from the skeletal remains of people. Tuberculosis rarely manifests itself in the skeleton of individuals and when it does, it is usually only in advanced stages of the disease. The tuberculosis bacteria stays in the growth centers and spongy areas of the bone. This disease has a very long period of maturation, or the time it takes the disease to reach its full destructive potential. Because of the long period of development in the body, tuberculosis damages the body and then the body has time to repair itself. The evidence of the disease in bones can be seen in the destruction and healing of the bone structures especially in joints. Tuberculosis therefore appears in the archaeology record in the knee and hip joints and also the spine.\n\nIt was thought that there was no tuberculosis infection in North America before the arrival of Europeans, but recent findings from the 80s and 90s have overturned that idea. Through extraction of DNA within the bone tuberculosis was not only found, but also dated to have been present in the Americas since 800 BC. Tuberculosis is a disease that thrives in dense populations. So the implications of finding tuberculosis in pre-Columbian society indicates that there was a large thriving community at the time. The earliest evidence of tuberculosis has been found in Italy dating to the 4th millennium BC. Evidence of tuberculosis has also been found in mummies from ancient Egypt dating to the same period. There is however, a lack of medical texts from ancient European and Mediterranean regions describing diseases that are identifiable as Tuberculosis but the bones show that there was a disease of this type.\n\nSyphilis is a disease classified in a category of Treponemal disease. This group includes diseases like pinta, yaws, endemic syphilis and venereal syphilis. These diseases have symptoms that include inflammatory changes in tissues throughout the body. Initially the infected person may notice an area of inflammation at the site where the bacteria entered the body. Then the individual can expect more widespread soft tissue changes and lastly the diseases start to affect the bones. However, Only 10-20 percent of people infected with venereal syphilis show bone changes. Venereal syphilis has more severe symptoms than the other types of treponemal disease. Nervous system and circulatory disruption are unique to venereal syphilis and are not seen in yaws, endemic syphilis or pinta.\n\nBone changes can be seen in the archaeological record through lesions on the surface on the bone. In venereal syphilis the bone change is characterized by damage to the knees and joints. The damaged joints could be the source of infection or they could be damaged because of disruption in the nervous systems and ability to feel. In the beginning stages of the disease, the bone forms small lesions on the skull and tibiae. These lesions are caused mostly by inflammation of the marrow. In the final stages of the disease the bones start to be destroyed. Lesions that are formed tend to look similar to \"worm holes\" in the bone and are seen in the skull as well as large bones in the body. Most of the bone that is destroyed is due to secondary infections.\n\nSyphilis has been seen in the Americas and Europe alike but there is debate as to what the origin of the disease is. Columbus and his sailors were said to have brought it to the Americas, however, Europeans blame Columbus for bringing the disease to Europe. There has not been any evidence of bone lesions associated with the disease that Columbus and the Europeans describe. The debate on the origins of venereal syphilis has been the subject of scientific discussions for hundreds of years and has recently been discussed and debated. At the first International Congress on the Evolution and Paleoepidemiology the subject was examined and debated by scholars from all over the world. There was no conclusive decision made as to the origin of venereal syphilis. There is however, more archaeological evidence for the disease in the Americas than there is for the disease in Europe at the time of Columbus's expeditions.\n\nMany diseases are also closely linked to animal domestication, making paleopathology an economically important factor. Many animals that have been domesticated by humans have limited genetic variation compared to wild cousins, making them particularly susceptible to disease both today and in the past. Good examples of this limited genetic variation today include cattle ranches, beekeeping, horse racing, and dog breeding.\n\nArchaeologists often study pathologies in the animals preserved in a human context. This could mean a burial ground or buried village where animals were cut up for food or perhaps animal bones were used for religious purposes. Baker and Brothwell’s seminal work was published in 1980 and is still considered a classic text, being frequently referred to within the discipline. However, this position of importance has largely come about, not because of its comprehensive coverage, but because there has been no real alternative. Most palaeopathological literature is to be found in periodicals or compiled publications of conference papers. No synthesis of the research in the field as a whole has been attempted for the last twenty-five years.\n\nPaleontologists have often studied paleopathologies in individual specimens, often with the intent of inferring genetic conditions or behavior. For example, many Theropod dinosaur individuals show healed fractures and puncture wounds in their bones, suggesting aggressive and/or territorial behavior. Mosasaurs show evidence of getting a version of the decompression syndrome while diving. Ancient rhinos show evidence of osteopathologies related to their weight and possibly activity level or environment. The extinct mammal \"Spinolestes\" displays the earliest possible evidence of dermatophytosis. Recent interest has also been given to the absence of disease. Both naked mole-rats and elephants exhibit extremely low cancer rates today. Ancient DNA from the ancestors of these two lineages might help us understand how cancer resistance evolved.\n\n\n\n"}

The \"dong\" units occupy the area of the city center, which was formerly occupied by Gyeongju-eup. \"Eup\" refers to a substantial village, whereas the \"myeon\" are more rural. The current divisions are as follows, using the numbers given on the map:\n\nAngang-eup (No.4) is the second-largest subdivision of Gyeongju City. Its 139 square kilometers are home to about 35,700 people. Situated next to Gangdong-myeon in the city's northern tip, it is a significant town in its own right. Angang Station is a regular stop on the Donghae Nambu Line. The town center lies on the Hyeongsan River, near where it meets the small Chilpyeongcheon stream.\n\nGampo-eup (No.8) also contains a piece of Gyeongju National Park: the Daebon section which covers the shoreline near the watery grave of King Munmu. 7,900 people live in Gampo-eup, served by three elementary schoos and a joint middle-high school. Important local products include persimmons as well as anchovies, seaweed, and squid.\n\nOedong-eup (No.10) is linked by road and rail to the neighboring metropolis of Ulsan. Thanks to this, it has been a center of the development of Gyeongju's automotive parts industry. Three industrial complexes are located here. Roughly 18,300 people live in Oedong-eup. This population is served by six elementary schools, a middle school, and a high school.\n\nGeoncheon-eup (No.12)\n\nSannae-myeon (No.1) - its name means \"within the mountains.\" Sannae-myeon covers 142.25 km² and is home to 3,695 people. It has an elementary school and a joint middle-high school.\n\nSeo-myeon (No.2) - its name means \"Western \"myeon\".\" An elementary school and middle school are located in Seo-myeon, serving a local population of 4,400.\n\nHyeongok-myeon (No.3) played a significant role in the history of Chondogyo, a Korean religion. Choe Je-u, the founder of Chondogyo, used Gumi Mountain as the base for his missionary activities in the early 1860s. The Gumi Mountain area is now part of Gyeongju National Park. Two elementary schools and a high school are located in Hyeongok-myeon, serving a population of 11,500.\n\nGangdong-myeon (No.5) its name means \"east of the river,\" although in fact much of it lies north of the Hyeongsan River. It is home to 9,000 people. Two elementary schools are located here, as is Uiduk University. The Yangdong Folk Village, a tourist attraction preserving the culture of the late Joseon Dynasty, also lies within Gangdong-myeon.\n\nCheonbuk-myeon (No.6) is home to about 6,100 people. It is home to two elementary schools, as well as Silla Industrial High School. The area is strongly agricultural. In addition to grain crops, apples are widely cultivated.\n\nYangbuk-myeon (No.7) stretches from central Gyeongju to the coast of the Sea of Japan (East Sea). Despite its large area, it is home to only 4,500 people. This is in part because much of it is taken up by the Toham-san section of Gyeongju National Park. Yangbuk-myeon is home to two elementary schools, a high school, and a joint elementary-middle school.\n\nYangnam-myeon (No.9) is the southernmost of the three coastal subdivisions of Gyeongju. The Wolseong Nuclear Power Plant is located on the coast. It provides about 5% of South Korea's electricity. About 6,800 people live in this district.\n\nNaenam-myeon (No.11)\n\nBodeok-dong (No.17)\n\nBulguk-dong (No.18)\n\nDongcheon-dong (No.22) is the site of Gyeongju City Hall.\n\nHwangnam-dong (No.24) is known across South Korea as the birthplace of Gyeongju bread-dong, a popular bean-paste pastry also often called \"Hwangnam bread.\"\n\nHwango-dong (No.21)\n\nHwangseong-dong (No.15)\n\nJungbu-dong (No.20)\n\nSeondo-dong (No.13)\n\nSeongdong-dong (No.25)\n\nSeonggeon-dong (No.14)\n\nTapjeong-dong (No.19)\n\nWolseong-dong (No.23)\n\nYonggang-dong (No.16)\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2212989", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2212989", "title": "Transverse engine", "text": "Transverse engine\n\nA transverse engine is an engine mounted in a vehicle so that the engine's crankshaft axis is perpendicular to the direction of travel. Many modern front wheel drive vehicles use this engine mounting configuration. Most rear wheel drive vehicles use a longitudinal engine configuration, where the engine's crankshaft axis is parallel with the direction of travel, except for some rear-mid engine vehicles, which use a transverse engine and transaxle mounted in the rear instead of the front. Despite typically being used in light vehicles, it is not restricted to light vehicles and has also been used on armored vehicles to save interior space.\n\nThe Critchley light car, made by the Daimler Motor Company in 1899, had a transverse engine with belt drive to the rear axle. A 1911 front-wheel drive car had a transverse engine with a clutch at each end, driving the front wheels directly.\n\nThe first successful transverse-engine cars were the two-cylinder DKW \"Front\" series of cars, which first appeared in 1931. During WWII transverse engines were developed for armored vehicles, with the Soviet T-44 and T-54/T-55 being equipped with transverse engines to save space in the hull. The T-54/55 eventually became the most produced tank in history.\n\nAfter the Second World War, SAAB used the configuration in their first model, the Saab 92, in 1947. The arrangement was also used for Borgward's Goliath and Hansa brand cars and in a few other German cars. However, it was with Alec Issigonis's Mini, introduced by the British Motor Corporation in 1959, that the design gained acclaim. Issigonis incorporated the car's gearbox into the engine's sump, producing a drivetrain unit narrow enough to install transversely in a car only four feet (1.2 metres) wide. While previous DKW and Saab cars used small two-stroke air-cooled engines with poor refinement and performance the gearbox-in-sump arrangement meant that an 848cc four-cylinder water-cooled engine could be fitted to the Mini, providing strong performance for a car of its size. Coupled to the much greater interior space afforded by the layout (the entire drivetrain only took up 20 per cent of the car's length) this made the Mini a genuine alternative to the conventional small family car.\n\nThis design reached its ultimate extent starting with Dante Giacosa's elaboration of it for Fiat. He connected the engine to its gearbox by a shaft and set the differential off-center so that it could be connected to the gearbox more easily. The axleshafts from the differential to the wheels therefore differed in length, which would have made the car's steering asymmetrical were it not for their torsional stiffness being made the same. Giacosa's lay-out was first used in the Autobianchi Primula in 1964 and later in the wide-selling Fiat 128. With the gearbox mounted separately to the engine these cars were by necessity larger than the Mini but this proved to be no disadvantage. The Giacosa lay-out also provided superior refinement, easier repair and was better-suited to adopting five-speed transmissions than the original Issigonis in-sump design. Now most small and small/medium-sized cars built throughout the world use this arrangement.\n\nThe Lamborghini Miura used a transverse, mid-mounted 4.0 litre V12, a configuration that was unheard of in 1965, although now more common (e.g. Lancia Montecarlo, Noble M12, Toyota MR2, Pontiac Fiero, Fiat X1/9)\n\nThe Land Rover LR2 Freelander, along with all Volvo models from 1998 on (including V8 models), employ a transversely-mounted engine in order to increase passenger space inside the vehicle. This has also allowed for improved safety in a frontal impact, due to more front to back engine compartment space being created. The result is a larger front crumple zone.\n\nTransverse engines have also been widely used in buses. In the United States they were offered in the early 1930s by Twin Coach and used with limited success in Dwight Austin's Pickwick Nite-Coach. Transverse bus engines first appeared widely in the Yellow Coach 719, using Dwight Austin's V-drive; they continued in common use until the 1990s, though shorter V-configuration engines in a straight in \"T-drive\" configuration became common in the 1960s. They were also used in the British Leyland Atlantean and in many transit buses and nearly all modern double decker buses. They have also been widely used by Scania, MAN, Volvo and Renault's bus divisions.\n\nEngines may be placed in two main positions within the motor car:\n\nSpace allowed for engines within the front wheel wells is commonly limited to the following:\n\n\n\nThe description of the orientation of V-twin and flat-twin motorcycle engines sometimes differs from the convention as stated above. Motorcycles with a V-twin engine mounted with its crankshaft mounted in line with the frame, e.g. the AJS S3 V-twin, Indian 841, Victoria Bergmeister, Honda CX series and several Moto Guzzis since the 1960s, are said to have \"transverse\" engines, while motorcycles with a V-twin mounted with its crankshaft mounted perpendicular to the frame, e.g. most Ducatis since the 1970s and most Harley-Davidsons, are said to have \"longitudinal\" engines. This convention uses the longest horizontal dimension (length or width) of the engine as its axis instead of the line of the crankshaft.\n\n"}

Also for \"2000 AD\", Fraser has drawn a number of \"Judge Dredd\" stories.\n\nReturning to the \"Judge Dredd Megazine\" in 2003, he collaborated with writer Rob Williams on \"Family\", a black and white series about a crime family with superhuman powers, which has recently been published as a collected edition. In 2005 he drew a four-part adaptation of Richard Matheson's \"Hell House\", scripted by Ian Edginton and published by IDW Publishing.\n\nFraser produced art on \"The Adventures of Nikolai Dante\" for \"2000 AD\", and the self-penned \"Lilly MacKenzie and the Mines of Charybdis\" which was published online, a page per week (every Friday) as part of the online comics collective Act-i-vate.\n\nIn 2015, he began doing covers for the horror comic, \"Tales of the Night Watchman\", published by So What? Press. In 2018, he began drawing sequential art for the series starting with \"The Ghost Train\" story, which appears in the \"Park Slope Reader\", a local Brooklyn newspaper. The story is about the elevated train involved in the infamous Malbone Street Wreck returning to terrorize the city on the centenary of the accident. It debuted in the paper's Spring 2018 edition, number 64. The strip is being colored by Gary Caldwell, Simon Fraser's frequent collaborator, which began following their work on Mark Millar's Kingsman (franchise) comic book sequel, \"The Red Circle\", published by Image Comics.\n\nIn 2018, Fraser received a Ringo Award nomination for best cover artist for his work on \"Tales of the Night Watchman\", \"Kingsman\", and \"The Consultant.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

The cross-section of the joint resembles the interlocking of fingers between two hands, hence the name \"finger joint\". The sides of each profile increases the surface area for gluing, resulting in a strong bond, stronger than a butt joint but not very visually appealing. Finger joints are regularly confused with box joints, which are used for corners of boxes or box-like constructions.\n\nFinger joints are generally created by using identical profiles for both pieces. They are made complementary by rotation or translation of the tool with respect to the workpiece. Typically a finger router bit is used, but spindle moulders can also be used. Manual cutting of finger joints is time-consuming and error prone hence rarely done except in craft pieces.\n\nA tapered or scarfed finger joint is the most common joint used to form long pieces of lumber from solid boards; the result is finger-jointed lumber.\n\nThe finger joint can also be valuable when creating baseboards, moulding or trim, and can be used in such things as floor boards, and door construction.\n\n\nhttps://www.nrcan.gc.ca/forests\n"}

He served in the army during the Civil War. After the war, he got a job with Harper & Brothers, where he stayed until 1872. After an unsuccessful attempt to become a publisher himself, in 1873 he became literary editor of the \"Christian Union\" (later called the \"Outlook\"), where he remained until 1877. From 1876 to 1893, he was literary critic on the staff of the \"New York Herald\".\n\nHabberton's first major work of fiction was \"Helen's Babies\", based on his sons' adventures (published in 1876 by Loring Publisher, Boston, in 1877 by David Byce and Son, Glasgow and in 1878 by William Mullan, London.It was revived in the early 20th century by George Routledge and Sons, London). The work was initially rejected, but finally published anonymously. Later the author's identity was revealed. The novel is subtitled \"With some account of their ways: innocent, droll, fascinating, roguish, mischievous, and naughty... By their latest victim, Uncle Harry.\"\n\nThe book was one of the Ruby Books series for boys and girls. Habberton is acknowledged as the author of the book in an advertisement within the 1903 edition of Andersen's Fairy Tales published by Routledge. Habberton is acknowledged, also, in an inexpensive cardboard-back edition of \"Helen's Babies\" published by (and copyrighted by) Whitman Publishing Company of Racine, Wisconsin in 1934. That edition is copiously illustrated by Pauline Adams.\n\n\"Helen's Babies\" was intended as just a piece of humour and aimed at an adult audience, but it almost instantly became a major juvenile literature success, highly estimated by youngsters, as well as authorities like Rudyard Kipling. Its popularity dwindled somewhat after World War II (although George Orwell mentions it favorably in his 1946 essay on early American literature, \"Riding Down from Bangor\"). It regained some interest in the 1980s. It was translated into numerous foreign languages and was adapted into a 1924 film of the same name, directed by William A. Seiter.\n\nHabberton is also known for his stories about early California life, many of which were collected in his 1880 book \"Romance of California Life: Illustrated by Pacific Slope Stories, Thrilling, Pathetic and Humorous\" (New York: Baker, Pratt & Co., 1880).\n\nHe was also known under the pseudonym \"Smelfungus.\"\n\nIn 1868, he married Alice Lawrence Hastings, who later suggested recording his sons' adventures.\n\n\n"}

Runner and writer Hal Higdon had been writing for the magazine since the beginning (2nd edition). In 1969, Anderson changed the name of the magazine to \"Runner's World\". He brought on Joe Henderson as chief editor and moved the editorial offices, now named World Publications, to Mountain View, California. \"Runner's World\" thrived during the 1970s \"running boom\", even in the face of competition from the New York-based magazine, \"The Runner\".\n\nIn the early 1980s, Bob Anderson sold a good portion of his publications, including \"Runner's World\". Some of Anderson's books went out of print while others were distributed by Macmillan Publishing. Robert Rodale of Rodale Inc., purchased \"Runner's World\" in 1985 and the editorial offices moved to Rodale's base in Emmaus, Pennsylvania. Joe Henderson did not move to Emmaus, and stepped down as editor, though he remained associated with the magazine until 2003. Random House bought the running log, which was published under the \"Runner's World\" name for decades after the sale.\n\nIn 1986 Rodale bought \"The Runner\", and merged the two magazines, keeping the \"Runner's World\" name and some writers, including Amby Burfoot who became the editor (a post he held until 2003).\n\n\"Runner's World\" remained strong through the so-called \"second running boom\" in the late 1990s. In 2004, the magazine had a full redesign. Since then, the magazine has won several awards including being ranked #1 on \"Adweek's\" Hot List, #6 on \"Advertising Age\"'s \"A-List\"; been recognized for having the \"Creative Team of the Year\", and most notably has been nominated three times for National Magazine Awards. Also, since the redesign, the magazine's circulation has increased from 525,000 to 650,000 at a time when most consumer magazines' circulations have declined, and advertising pages and revenue remain at an all time high. The publisher of \"Runner's World's\" United States' edition is Molly O'Keefe and its editor is David Willey.\n\nIn February 2007, Rodale acquired \"Running Times\" magazine with the objective of getting the magazine back on its original mission to serve the front of the pack.\n\nHearst acquired Rodale in 2018. \"Runner's World\" offices were moved from Emmaus, Pennsylvania to Easton, Pennsylvania.\n\nSince the early 1990s, \"Runner's World\" has expanded outside the United States, currently with 18 international editions. The first was a United Kingdom edition wholly owned by NatMag Rodale, a joint venture between Rodale Inc. and The Hearst Corporation in the UK. Editions in Argentina, Australia/New Zealand, Belgium, Brazil, China, Colombia, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, and Turkey are published either as joint ventures or through licensing arrangements with publishers in those countries. Editors in each country have access to editorial content from the U.S. edition, but also publish their own original content with local flavor.\n\n"}

Whitman was American intercollegiate singles tennis champion in 1896 and doubles champion in 1897 and 1898 as a student at Harvard University. He graduated from Harvard Law School in 1899 and received his bachelor in law degree in 1902.\n\nIn 1896 Whitman entered his first U.S. National Championships at the Newport Casino and lost in the quarterfinals to Bill Larned. The following year, 1897, he again lost in the quarterfinals, this time against Harold Nisbet. Whitman is best known for this hat-trick of singles titles at the U.S. National Championships. Between 1898 and 1900, he stayed undefeated there. In 1901 he did not compete and in the 1902 Championships he lost in the All-Comers final to Englishman Reginald Doherty. According to the Doherty brothers Malcolm Whitman and Bill Larned were at the time the best American singles players.\n\nHe played on the inaugural American Davis Cup squad in 1900 and beat Englishman Arthur Gore in Boston, MA to help his US team win the trophy. In the 1902 Davis Cup final against Great Britain in Brooklyn, NY he again contributed to his team's win by defeating Joshua Pim and Reginald Doherty in the singles.\n\nWhitman retired from tennis in 1902 at the age of 25. He was a member of the Executive Committee of the U.S. National Lawn Tennis Association (USNLTA) and held management positions in several companies.\n\nIn 1932 he wrote a book on the origin of tennis titled \"\"Tennis - Origins and Mysteries\"\".\n\nIn their book \"R.F. and H.L.

In his last competitive season he rode in the Superbike World Championship for Italy-based GRT team using Yamaha R1 machines with teammate Sandro Cortese. In July 2019, Melandri announced his intended retirement at the end of the season.\n\nMelandri lost his position with the Ducati factory team midway through the 2018 Superbike season, finishing the 2018 riders' championship in fifth place.\n\nMelandri was the 2002 250 cc World Champion, and finished second overall in the 2005 MotoGP season.\n\nMelandri was born in Ravenna. He was introduced to racing by a former rider Loris Reggiani at the age of six. He came through the ranks from minibikes, motocross and then the Italian and European 125cc championship.\n\nIn 1997, Melandri won the Italian 125cc championship, also finishing 4th in European 125cc championship. In addition to his European success, he made his debut in 125cc world championship at Brno, Czech Republic as a wild card rider.\n\nAfter impressing in Italian and European championship in 1997, Melandri finally got his chance to compete in 1998 125cc world championship as a regular. He rode Honda 125cc bike under Benetton Honda Team. He went on to impress many as he earned his first podium in the fourth race of the season, where he finished second in his home Grand Prix at Mugello, Italy. His brilliant debut season continued when he won his first grand prix at Assen TT, Netherlands. He won this race at the age of 15 years and 324 days which made him the youngest ever Grand Prix winner, at the time. Overall, he won two Grand Prix in his debut season and therefore he finished the season at 3rd position in overall standings behind champion Kazuto Sakata and runner-up Tomomi Manako.\n\nHe remained on the same bike and team in 1999, where he bid to win the 125cc world championship. He went on to win 5 Grand Prix but failed to win the championship, finishing second behind Emilio Alzamora with just a single point difference. Failure in securing his first world championship did not stop his rise to 250cc world championship in 2000.\n\nMelandri was signed by Aprilia in 2000 to replace another Italian Valentino Rossi who left the team and 250cc class for 500cc class. He was highly expected to take over Rossi's shoes and to win the 250cc world championship. However, his debut season did not start as well as the expectation. He struggled to adapt to bigger bike and higher competition. He failed to win any Grand Prix in 2000, managing only 4 podiums, all came late in the season. Despite these problems, he still finishes the season at 5th position overall.\n\nIn 2001, his performances were improving. He managed to win his first 250cc Grand Prix at Sachsenring, Germany. However, it was his only win in 2001. Despite managing to appear on the podium on 9 occasions, he never really challenged for the championship. He finished the season in 3rd position behind champion Daijiro Kato and runner-up Tetsuya Harada.\n\n2002 proved to be Melandri's chance to shine. With 2001 champion and runner-up, Kato and Harada moved to MotoGP class, he became the strongest contender for the championship. He dominated the season by collecting 9 wins and 3 additional podiums. After challenging for world championship for years, he finally won the 250cc world title. He became the youngest 250cc world champion at the age of 20 years and 74 days until Dani Pedrosa broke his record in 2004.\n\nAfter securing the 250cc world title in 2002, Melandri moved up to MotoGP class to spearhead Yamaha factory team alongside Carlos Checa in 2003 replacing the departing Max Biaggi. The Yamaha was less competitive than Honda and Ducati, and although Melandri at times showed good speed, he struggled to turn this into good results. He finished the season in fifteenth position without collecting any wins or podiums.\n\nHe joined Yamaha satellite team, Tech 3 in 2004 alongside Norick Abe. This season, he again struggled to get top results. Although he managed to collect two consecutive podiums, a series of crashes and retirements kept him out of the top 10 in overall standings. He finished the season in twelfth position.\n\nReleased from his Yamaha contract after the 2004 season, Melandri was the surprise choice of boss Fausto Gresini to join Sete Gibernau in the Movistar Honda team for the 2005 MotoGP campaign. Melandri was successful with Movistar Honda in 2005, with a consistent run of podium finishes early in the season, ultimately taking his first two wins in the final two races of 2005 to clinch second place in the championship. In doing so, he was the first Honda rider to win back-to-back races for nearly two years, winning the final two rounds of the MotoGP Championship at Istanbul and in Valencia. Although he never really challenged his best friend Valentino Rossi for the title, he finished the season strongly as runner-up, with a total of two wins and five other podiums.\n\nMelandri rode for Gresini's Fortuna Honda team alongside Toni Elías in the 2006 season. With Rossi struggling to find consistency, he was a major challenger, along with Ducati's Loris Capirossi and Honda riders Nicky Hayden and Dani Pedrosa. He again won at Istanbul, despite starting from fourteenth on the grid. He managed further wins at Le Mans, France and Phillip Island, Australia. He finished the season in fourth position, just one point behind Capirossi.\nIn 2007, Melandri and Elias remained in the Honda Gresini team, now sponsored by Hannspree. Honda's 800cc machine was not competitive. Melandri finished on the podium at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca and Le Mans – at this point he and works rider Dani Pedrosa were the only Honda riders with multiple podiums. He ultimately finished fifth overall, second only to Pedrosa among the Honda riders.\n\nImmediately after Melandri's 3rd-place finish in the 2007 USA's MotoGP round, Ducati announced that he would join its factory team alongside Casey Stoner for 2008 and 2009. But 2008 proved disastrous, with a run of uncompetitive runs often leaving him behind the semi-works Alice Team bikes of Toni Elías and Sylvain Guintoli. At Assen he qualified last and ran there throughout. A rumoured mid-season move to Kawasaki did not occur, however Melandri announced that he would be joining Kawasaki Racing Team for the 2009 MotoGP season to ride alongside his new teammate John Hopkins on 19 August. He then ended the season in a lacklustre 17th position.\n\nKawasaki pulled its factory involvement for 2009, leading to fears that Melandri would not have a ride, however a rescue package was agreed to allow Melandri to run the bike for a one-bike semi-works Hayate Racing team, despite his concerns over the bike's poor rear traction. In 2009 Melandri achieved his first podium since 2007 with his 2nd-place finish at the wet French motorcycle Grand Prix. His only other top six finishes were in the first three races, as the team tailed off bike development and Melandri finished tenth overall. At Brno he battled Mika Kallio for sixth before a penultimate-lap collision between the two.\n\nFor 2010, Melandri returned to Gresini Honda, with a factory-spec RC212V bike from the start. Full factory support had sometimes been promised, but not provided, during his first Gresini spell. The team made set-up errors in its initial testing.\n\nMelandri moved to the Superbike World Championship from 2011 with the Yamaha World Superbike Team, replacing Cal Crutchlow, who moved to the Tech 3 team in MotoGP.\n\nOn 2 October 2011, Melandri signed a contract to ride with the BMW World Superbike team for the 2012 season, after Yamaha elected not to continue with a factory team after the 2011 season. Melandri achieved BMW's best result, at the time, in the Superbike World Championship, with a second place in the season-opening race at Phillip Island, having started 13th on the grid. Mixed results followed at Imola, Assen and Monza, but Melandri achieved BMW's first Superbike World Championship victory at the European round at Donington Park, leading home teammate Leon Haslam in a 1–2 finish. Melandri and Haslam collided in the meeting's second race, denying a weekend sweep for BMW. From that point, Melandri won races at Miller Motorsports Park, Motorland Aragón and a double at Brno, to move within 21 points of the championship lead held by Max Biaggi.\n\nIn November 2014, it was announced that Melandri would return to Gresini, Aprilia's factory team for the 2015 season. However, after failing to score a point in the first eight races of the season, Melandri left the team and was replaced by Michael Laverty and then by Stefan Bradl.\n\nIn addition to his motorcycle racing career, Melandri has also competed in car racing. He raced in two rounds of the 2008-09 Speedcar Series season, scoring two points from the four races.\n"}

Established in 1873, the club became members of the Football League in 1893 and remained members of the Second Division until 1912, making Gainsborough one of the smallest towns in England to have had a Football League team. They are currently members of and play at the Northolme.\n\nThe club was established in 1873 as Trinity Recreationists by Reverend George Langton Hodgkinson, the vicar at the Holy Trinity Church. In 1889 the club were founder members of the Midland League, which they won in 1890–91. The club finished as runners-up the following season and again in 1895–96, after which they applied for election to the Football League. In the vote they finished third, ahead of existing members Port Vale and Crewe Alexandra, and were elected into the Second Division. The club's first season in Division Two of the League saw them finish seventh, but a gradual decline in form saw them finish in the bottom half of the table every season until 1904. In 1901–02 Trinity finished bottom of the division, but were re-elected. In 1904–05 the club finished sixth in Division Two, their best performance during their Football League membership.\n\nIn 1911–12 Gainsborough finished bottom of the Second Division for a second time, and failed to be re-elected, receiving just nine votes to the 27 received by newly elected Lincoln City. The club returned to the Midland League, finishing third in 1912–13 and second in 1913–14, after which they unsuccessfully applied for readmission to the Football League. When the Football League created a new Third Division North in 1921, Trinity applied for membership, but were again unsuccessful. The club won the Midland League title in 1927–28, and the following season defeated Football League opposition in the FA Cup for the first time since losing their League status, beating Crewe 3–1 in the first round, before losing to Chesterfield in the second round. In 1931–32 they beat Crewe again in the first round, before losing 5–2 at home to Watford. In 1937–38 Trinity beat Port Vale in the first round, before losing to fellow non-League club Yeovil & Petters United. Another Football League team was beaten the following season, when Trinity knocked out Gateshead in the first round, before losing to Doncaster Rovers.\n\nFollowing World War II Gainsborough had further success in the FA Cup, reaching the first round of the FA Cup in 1945–46, losing to Mansfield Town, and in 1946–47, when they were beaten by Darlington. In 1948–49 they reached the second round after defeating Witton Albion in the first round, before losing 4–3 at Walsall. They went on to win a third Midland League title that season. First round appearances in the FA Cup followed in 1950–51 (losing 3–0 to Plymouth) and 1951–52 (losing to Witton), before the 1952–53 season saw another second round appearance; after beating Netherfield in a first round replay, they lost 2–1 at Newport County. They reached the first round again the following season, before losing 4–1 at home to Chesterfield. The club failed to repeat the feat until 1959–60, when they lost to Doncaster Rovers in a replay.\n\nAt the end of the 1959–60 season, the Midland League was disbanded. Gainsborough spent a single season playing in both the Central Alliance and Division Two of the Yorkshire League, before returning to a reformed Midland League in 1961. Trinity won their fourth Midland League title in 1966–67, also reaching the first round of the FA Cup (losing 1–0 at home to Colchester United), before becoming founder members of the new Northern Premier League in 1968. The club applied to join the Football League again in 1975 and 1976, but received only a single vote on each occasion. The 1983–84 season saw them reach the first round of the FA Cup for over a decade, as they lost 2–0 at home to Blackpool.\n\nWhen the Northern Premier League added a second division in 1987, Gainsborough were placed in the Premier Division. In 1997–98 FA Cup saw them drawn against local rivals Lincoln City, who won 3–2 in a 'home' replay that was played at Lincoln's Sincil Bank. Another first round appearance in 2003–04 ended with a 7–1 defeat at Brentford. At the end of the season a tenth-place finish saw the club become founder members of the Conference North. FA Cup first round appearances followed in 2006–07 (a 3–1 defeat by Barnet) and 2007–08 (a 6–0 loss at home to Hartlepool United). In 2011–12 the club finished fourth, qualifying for the promotion play-offs. However, after beating Halifax Town in the semi-finals, Trinity lost the final 1–0 to Nuneaton Town. In another FA Cup first round appearance in 2015–16, the club were beaten 1–0 by Shrewsbury Town. The club were relegated for the first time in their history at the end of the 2017–18 season, dropping into the Northern Premier League's Premier Division.\n\nTrinity moved to the Northolme ground, then also a cricket venue, in 1884. During their time in the Football League the club also played home matches at the Bowling Green Ground in the north-west of the town and Sincil Bank in Lincoln when the Northolme was being used for cricket. The record attendance of 9,760 was set for a Midland League match against local rivals Scunthorpe United in 1948.\n\nGainsborough Trinity's location on the bank of the River Trent pits them against a host of clubs from Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire. The most noted local derbys for Gainsborough are against Boston United and Worksop Town, as both clubs have spent numerous seasons in both the Northern Premier League and Conference North divisions with Trinity. Games with Boston or Worksop are traditionally played on Boxing Day and New Year's Day.\n\nProfessional clubs in traditional Lincolnshire such as Lincoln City, Scunthorpe United and Grimsby Town have rarely played Trinity outside of pre-season tournaments such as the Lincolnshire Senior Cup. The last competitive match between Trinity and a professional Lincolnshire club was when they played Lincoln City in the first round of the FA Cup in the 1996–97 season, with Trinity eventually losing 3–2 in the replay following a 1–1 draw at Sincil Bank.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The work can be dated from 375 to 380 AD. The provenance is usually regarded as Syria, probably Antioch. The author is unknown, even if since James Ussher it was considered to be the same author of the letters of Pseudo-Ignatius, perhaps the 4th-century Eunomian bishop Julian of Cilicia.\n\nThe \"Apostolic Constitutions\" contains eight treatises on Early Christian discipline, worship, and doctrine, intended to serve as a manual of guidance for the clergy, and to some extent for the laity. It purports to be the work of the Twelve Apostles, whose instructions, whether given by them as individuals or as a body.\n\nThe structure of the \"Apostolic Constitutions\" can be summarized:\n\nThe best manuscript has Arian leanings, which are not found in other manuscripts because this material would have been censured as heretical.\n\nThe \"Apostolic Constitutions\" is an important source for the history of the liturgy in the Antiochene rite. It contains an outline of an anaphora in book two, a full anaphora in book seven (which is an expansion of the one found in the Didache), and the complete Liturgy of the eighth book of the \"Apostolic Constitutions\", which is the oldest known form that can be described as a complete divine liturgy.\n\nIn antiquity, the \"Apostolic Constitutions\" were mistakenly supposed to be gathered and handed down by Clement of Rome, the authority of whose name gave weight to more than one such piece of early Christian literature (see also Clementine literature).\n\nThe Church seems never to have regarded this work as of undoubted Apostolic authority. The \"Apostolic Constitutions\" were rejected as canonical by the Decretum Gelasianum. The Quinisext Council in 692 rejected most part of the work on account of the interpolations of heretics. Only that portion of it to which has been given the name \"Canons of the Apostles\" was received in the Eastern Christianity. Even if not regarded as of certain Apostolic origin, however, in antiquity the Apostolic Constitutions were held generally in high esteem and served as the basis for much ecclesiastical legislation. The \"Apostolic Constitutions\" were accepted as canonical by John of Damascus and, in a modified form, included in the 81 book canon of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church.\n\nEven if the text of the \"Apostolic Constitutions\" was extant in many libraries during the Middle Age, it was almost unknown. In 1546 a Latin version of a text was found in Crete and published. The first complete edition of the Greek text was printed in 1563 by Turrianus.\n\nWilliam Whiston in the 18th century devoted the third volume of his \"Primitive Christianity Revived\" to prove that \"they are the most sacred of the canonical books of the New Testament; \"for \"these sacred Christian laws or constitutions were delivered at Jerusalem, and in Mount Sion, by our Saviour to the eleven apostles there assembled after His resurrection.\"\n\nToday the \"Apostolic Constitutions\" are of the highest value as a historical document, as they reveal the moral and religious conditions, as well as the liturgical observances of 3rd and 4th centuries. They are part of the \"Ante-Nicene Fathers\" collection.\n\nThe forty-seventh and last chapter of the eighth book of the \"Apostolic Constitutions\" contains the eighty-five Canons of the Apostles, which present themselves as being from an apostolic Council at Antioch. These canons were later approved by the Eastern Council in Trullo in 692 but rejected by Pope Constantine. In the Western Church only fifty of these canons circulated, translated to Latin by Dionysius Exiguus on about 500 AD, and included in the Western collections and afterwards in the \"Corpus Juris Canonici\".\n\nCanon n. 85 is a list of canonical books: a 46-book Old Testament canon which essentially corresponds to that of the Septuagint, 26 books of what is now the New Testament (excludes Revelation), two Epistles of Clement, and the Apostolic Constitutions themselves, also here attributed to Clement, at least as compiler.\n\nIt is also known as the Epitome, and usually named Epitome of the eighth Book of the Apostolic Constitutions (or sometime titled \"The Constitutions of the Holy Apostles concerning ordination through Hippolytus\" or simply \"The Constitutions through Hippolytus\") containing a re-wording of chapters 1-2, 4-5, 16-28, 30-34, 45-46 of the eighth book. The text was first published by Paul de Lagarde in 1856 and later by Franz Xaver von Funk in 1905. This epitome could be a later extract even if in parts it looks nearer to the Greek original of the Apostolic Tradition, from which the 8th book is derived, than the Apostolic Constitutions themselves.\n\n\n"}

They are described as psychedelic, space rock, jazz fusion, jagged alternating vocal harmonies, sugary synthesiser pop, punk, prog, epic/atmospheric, noise-rock, wavering three-part a cappella, borderline operatic vocals, often in the space of a single song. Live performances are known to include home-made costumes, synchronised robot dancing and frog-related items. Enthusiastic supporters include Mike Patton and Jello Biafra:\n\neX-Girl was founded in 1997. Its original members were Chihiro, Kirilo and Fuzuki. Regardless of the members' non-existing musical experience, their career started off quickly as they began touring and released their debut album within a year from creating the band, all safely under the wings of the famous producer/keyboardist Hoppy Kamiyama. \n\nIn 1999, the band performed at the Japan Nite event at SXSW in Austin, Texas. Around this time Virgin Mega Store and Tower Records noticed eX-Girl and did their part in marketing the new album \"Kero! Kero! Kero!\".\n\nThe a cappella album \"Big When Far, Small When Close\" was released in 2000 via Kirilo's own label Kikipoo Records. At the same time eX-Girl released their previous album in Europe, which brought the band to tour the continent for the first time. In July, they toured together with Fantômas, with the help of Mike Patton (Faith No More). The band performed in Finland from October to November.\n\nThe group returned to Europe again in 2001, playing at big events such as Denmark's Roskilde Festival. At the end of the year, they had their first ever change of line-up as Chihiro quit and Keiko (of Super Junky Monkey) picked up the spot of being eX-Girl's guitarist. Before the change though, the original members had a project named PUNK LADY, where they covered Pink Lady's biggest hits. eX-Girl, with the new line-up, toured again in Finland in 2002, before having the chance to support Siouxsie and the Banshees on its tours both in the US and the UK. This had a positive effect on their popularity.\n\nThe line-up continued to change. Drummer Fuzuki left eX-Girl in 2003, replaced by Chapple. Kirilo changed her name to Kirilola and Keiko changed hers to Keikos. The American-based label Alternative Tentacles released the next album \"Endangered Species\", during which the band used another guitarist named Zorek, though only on tour. The album was completed by Keiko's guitar. When Keiko returned, the drummer changed once again. Despite the changes, the band continued touring in the United States, but time inevitably brought more changes. By the beginning of the year 2006, Kirilola had changed her position from bass to guitar, and the new member Laan Zukioh was the new bassist. Later in the summer, Bonb-Chu was found to fulfill his position as drummer. With this new line-up the group started their new world tour in October 2006.\n\nBy the summer of 2007, the band flew to Northern Europe and held seven performances over the span of two months. Shortly after this final tour, the band announced they would be taking an indefinite hiatus. The band went dormant in 2007. In 2018, Kirilola announced on their web site that she had reformed the band after returning from climbing Mt. Hakusan to discover a U.S. record label, Secret Records, wanted to reprint \"Kero Kero Kero\" on vinyl. Inspired by this, Kirilola searched for two new members and announced their first reunion show in 11 years at Kichijoji GB in Kichijoji, Tokyo on October 18, 2018.\n\nThe band's only remaining original member, Kirilola, has several ongoing music-related projects. The artist has taken part in Kamiyama's artistic projects with her singing, playing and dancing, and in 2004, she released spiritual healing music under the project name Akasau. This album was recorded together with several musicians, the main one being Renge, who plays traditional Japanese bells. In 2009, Kirilola presented her solo \"Nuriemaki\" performances, with costumes based on kimono and folk outfits and accompanied by traditional Japanese instruments.\n\nIn March 2019, eX-Girl performed at SXSW in Austin, Texas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2213065", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2213065", "title": "Bullet for My Valentine", "text": "Bullet for My Valentine\n\nBullet for My Valentine, often abbreviated as BFMV, are a Welsh heavy metal band from Bridgend, Wales, formed in 1998. The band is currently composed of Matthew Tuck (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Michael Paget (lead guitar, backing vocals), Jason Bowld (drums) and Jamie Mathias (bass guitar). Former members include Michael Thomas, Jason James and Nick Crandle; the latter were on bass. They were formed under the name Jeff Killed John and started their music career by covering songs by Metallica and Nirvana. Jeff Killed John recorded six songs which were not released; two of these tracks were reworked later in their career as Bullet for My Valentine. A change of style from that of Jeff Killed John led the band to change their name. In 2002, the band secured a five-album deal with Sony BMG. The band has stated that their music is influenced by classic metal acts such as Metallica, Iron Maiden and Slayer. The band is part of the Cardiff music scene.\n\nBullet for My Valentine's debut album \"The Poison\" was released on 3 October 2005 in the United Kingdom and on 14 February 2006 in the United States to coincide with Valentine's Day, in a nod to the band's name. The album entered the U.S. \"Billboard\" 200 at number 128. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. The band made appearances at the Download Festival and \"Kerrang!\" XXV, and undertook a U.S. tour with Rob Zombie. Bullet for My Valentine's second studio album, \"Scream Aim Fire\", was released on 29 January 2008 and debuted at number four on the \"Billboard\" 200. The band's third album, \"Fever\", was released on 26 April 2010 and debuted at number three on the \"Billboard\" 200. On 8 February 2013 the band released their fourth studio album, \"Temper Temper\", which peaked at number 13 on the \"Billboard 200\". On 14 August 2015 the band released their fifth studio album, \"Venom\", which peaked at number 8 on the \"Billboard 200\". On 29 June 2018 the band released their sixth studio album, \"Gravity\". The band has sold over one million albums in the United States and over 3,000,000 albums worldwide and are the most-successful act in the \"Kerrang! Awards\" category of \"Best British Band\" with three wins.\n\nJeff Killed John was the forerunner band to Bullet for My Valentine and was formed in 1998 by Matthew Tuck, Michael \"Padge\" Paget, Nick Crandle, and Michael \"Moose\" Thomas while studying music at Bridgend College. They started playing Nirvana and Metallica cover songs. In 1999, the band released their first ever EP, Better Off Alone. They released another two-track EP in 2002, \"You/Play with Me\", which was produced by Greg Haver. The EP was financed through the Pynci scheme for new Welsh musicians and the release garnered radio airplay on BBC Radio 1's broadcast at Newport's T.J.'s. Jeff Killed John's music followed the nu metal trend set by bands such as Korn and Limp Bizkit. Shortly after, the band released another two-track EP titled \"Eye Spy\". In 2003, their second EP was released titled \"Don't Walk Away\". This was a promotional CD and was shipped to different record companies, as well as being given out locally in Bridgend. Bassist Crandle left the band on the eve of entering the recording sessions for the band's self-titled EP and was replaced by Jason James. The band then changed their name to Bullet for My Valentine and reworked their musical strategy; they decided to play heavy metal songs with \"harmony guitars and big angelic choruses,\" according to frontman Tuck. In late 2003, they released their final EP before record labels actually began to notice their potential. This happened due to the sudden change in their strategy and sound, which the band claims came \"directly out of their heads.\" Their self-titled EP consisted of five songs; most of the songs became precursors of tracks from \"The Poison\".\n\nRoadrunner Records showed interest in Bullet for My Valentine and offered the band a deal. The offer was ultimately turned down, and the band signed a five-album record deal with Sony BMG and a UK licensing deal with Visible Noise. According to Tuck, they chose Sony because, \"We thought that a lot more doors would be open to us.\" A self-titled EP was released on 15 November 2004 in the UK. Produced by Colin Richardson, it featured five tracks and marked the band's first official release. A second EP, \"Hand of Blood,\" was released on 22 August 2005 through Trustkill Records and was only available in the U.S.; the release contained one extra track than the self-titled EP, \"4 Words (To Choke Upon).\" Daniel Lukes of \"Decibel Magazine\" reviewed the EP by stating, \"The worst part is that the music itself isn’t all that bad, for the genre.\" He went on to comment that the band should be \"embarrassed\" about the release. Zero Magazine's Josh Joyce complimented the band on \"how technical they can get without confusing the kids.\"\n\nBullet for My Valentine's debut album, \"The Poison\", was released on 3 October 2005 in the UK and on Valentine's Day 2006 in the US. It entered the \"Billboard\" 200 at number 128, and attained number 11 on the Independent Albums chart. On 30 January 2009, the album was certified gold by the RIAA after 500,000 copies were sold in the US. Four singles were released from \"The Poison\": \"4 Words (To Choke Upon)\", \"Suffocating Under Words of Sorrow (What Can I Do)\", \"All These Things I Hate (Revolve Around Me)\", and \"Tears Don't Fall\". Bullet for My Valentine promoted the album by touring across the world. In 2005, with increased popularity, they played on the larger Download Festival Snickers stage; in 2006, the band were moved to near the top of the main stage bill. Other tours included opening for Metallica and Guns N' Roses in the summer of 2006,<ref name=\"Bullet for My Valentine - Matt Tuck, Vocals/Guitars\"></ref> the Vans Warped Tour and Earthday Birthday.\n\nThe band's headline performance at Kerrang XXV, a one-off gig at Brixton Academy in London on 28 January 2006, was filmed for their first DVD, \"\". During June 2007, Tuck suffered from laryngitis, which led to an emergency tonsillectomy in July. Bullet for My Valentine were forced to cancel several shows, including supporting Metallica for three dates on their Sick of the Studio '07 tour on 29 June in Bilbao, 5 July in Vienna, and 8 July at the recently completed Wembley Stadium in London. Unable to speak, Tuck wrote that as soon as doctors cleared him he would be in the studio working on the band's next album.\n\nThe band's second studio album, \"Scream Aim Fire\", was recorded at Sonic Ranch Studios and was produced by Colin Richardson. Tuck commented at the time, \"It's a lot more up tempo, a lot more aggressive.\" The album was released in the U.S. on 29 January 2008. It sold 53,000 copies in its first week and peaked at number four on the \"Billboard\" 200. Three songs were released as singles: \"Scream Aim Fire,\" \"Hearts Burst into Fire\" and \"Waking the Demon.\"\n\nIn support of the new album, the band toured North America and Australia in the spring of 2008 for the Taste of Chaos tour alongside Atreyu, Blessthefall and Avenged Sevenfold. Bullet for My Valentine cut short the Canada portion of the tour and flew back home to support the daughter of James who was in hospital. The band performed in North America again in the summer of 2008 as part of the No Fear Tour with Bleeding Through, Cancer Bats and Black Tide. In late 2008, the band toured Europe, supported by Lacuna Coil, Bleeding Through, and Black Tide. In December 2008, \"Scream Aim Fire\" was re-released with four bonus tracks that were recorded during the album's studio sessions, but with re-recorded vocal-lines.\n\nMatt Tuck spoke to Daniel Marez of \"Metal Hammer\" in March 2009 about the band's progress on writing and recording their third album. Tuck stated that there were four or five songs that were finished and that \"usually we write and record 14 tracks that I then have to write vocal lines for, but this time I’m trying to write the vocals as I write the music.\" Bullet for My Valentine confirmed in August 2009 that they were aiming for an early 2010 release for the new album, while Tuck stated that the upcoming record is \"a lot more mature-sounding, it's a lot more classic. It'll stand the test of time [more] than both the previous things we've done.\" In a January 2010 interview with \"Rock Sound\", Tuck stated explained details for the album: it would be titled \"Fever\", and the 11-track record would have a sound closer to \"The Poison\" rather than \"Scream Aim Fire\" and contain no ballads.\n\nDuring the summer of 2009, Bullet for My Valentine toured across the United States as part of the Mayhem Festival, alongside Killswitch Engage, Slayer and Marilyn Manson on the main stage; they also appeared on the UK leg of the Sonisphere tour at Knebworth, headlining the second stage. The band headlined the second stage at the Download Festival 2010 on the Friday night. The band was also confirmed for Nova Rock, Metaltown, Rock am Ring, Rock on the Range, The Bamboozle, Bilbao Live Festival, Fortarock and Graspop. In addition, Bullet for My Valentine also played alongside the Big Four on the Greek leg of Sonisphere. \"Fever\" was released on 27 April 2010. A free download of a new track called \"Begging For Mercy\" was released on the band's website on 14 February 2010 as part of a Twitter promotion. The song \"Your Betrayal\" was chosen as the lead single for the album and was set to release on 9 March 2010, but, unexpectedly, was released earlier on 2 March 2010 as a digital single on iTunes Store. The second single is called \"The Last Fight\" and was released on 19 April. The album artwork for this studio album was released on the official website on 5 March 2010. Bullet for My Valentine announced the start their US tour in support of \"Fever\". It began on 30 April with the bands Airbourne and Chiodos as support. On 12 March the band released the music videos for \"The Last Fight\" and \"Your Betrayal.\" The band revealed the track listing on their website on 15 March, as well as other various sources that include an email to all of their subscribers on the mailing list. On 26 April the band played a secret show in London to celebrate the release of \"Fever\". This was their only UK headline show until the end of the year.\n\nOn 28 January 2011, Michael Paget stated that the group had already drawn proportions for the next studio album and will sound a lot like \"Fever\". He followed-along with stating that the band plans to have the songs for it written within 2011 and will begin recording the album by the end of the year. A couple tracks left from the \"Fever\" sessions might be re-done, re-arranged and re-recorded for the new record. The band played at Uproar Festival 2011, after which they began writing material for a fourth studio album.\n\nOn 7 October, RCA Music Group announced it was disbanding Jive Records along with Arista Records and J Records. With the shutdown, the band (and all other artists previously signed to these three labels) will release their future material (including their next studio album) on the RCA Records brand. Also in October, frontman Matt Tuck announced that he will be working on a new side project which he has described as \"metal as fuck\", influenced by bands such as Pantera and Slipknot. On 1 May 2012 it was revealed that the project will be called AxeWound, and will feature Liam Cormier, Mike Kingswood, Joe Copcutt and Jason Bowld. In May 2012 it was announced that Bullet for My Valentine would be playing at the South African music festival Oppikoppi, as well as a once-off gig in Cape Town alongside Seether and Enter Shikari. They were slated to play in the country for the Coke Zero Fest of 2009, but pulled out at the last minute to record Fever. It was confirmed on 6 August that the final recording session of the band's fourth studio record was complete, and that the album would be out sometime in late 2012. Later that month on the 17th, the second line-up for the Australian music festival Soundwave was announced, containing Bullet for My Valentine.\n\nBullet for My Valentine released the track \"Temper Temper\" on 25 November in the UK and 30 October worldwide across all digital providers. The song was debuted live by the band on Monday 22 October at BBC Radio 1's Rock Week where they performed at Maida Vale studios. It was announced the day prior to the performance that the band's fourth studio album would also be named \"Temper Temper\". The release date was confirmed to be 12 February 2013.\n\nThe band began touring in support of \"Temper Temper\" on 10 February 2013, and finished the tour on 3 November 2013. The tenth show of the tour, held at Birmingham's O2 Academy, was filmed by music video website Moshcam.com.\n\nIn an interview, Matt Tuck said that Bullet for My Valentine were going to start work on a new album before the Rule Britannia Tour, which took place between 1 and 6 December 2013 in which the band played arenas in Britain supported by Young Guns and Asking Alexandria. In the interview Matt also said that they were strongly considering working with Terry Date, who has worked with bands such as Pantera and Deftones. He also said the band would bring back the thrash metal elements from \"Scream Aim Fire\".\n\nIn November 2013, Bullet for My Valentine revealed though their Facebook page they were working on a new song. A short snippet of the song, titled \"Raising Hell,\" was released on Matt Tuck's Vine profile on the 15th. The song was first played three days later via BBC Radio 1's Rock Show. It was made available for streaming and a music video for the song was released a week later.\n\nIn 2014, Matt announced on Twitter that the band were entering the studio to record a fifth album. On 28 August the band appeared on paranormal television show Most Haunted for an investigation at the Newton House in Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire.\n\nIn an interview with \"Kerrang!\" on 21 January 2015, Matt revealed that Bullet for My Valentine will be hitting the studio next month with producer Colin Richardson who produced both \"The Poison\" and \"Scream Aim Fire\", rather than Terry Date, who was the suggested producer initially. Tuck also said that their fifth album will be their heaviest album yet.\nOn 9 February 2015, Bullet for My Valentine announced the departure of bassist Jason James, adding that they would announce a replacement when they felt \"the time was right.\" They went on to say that until the announcement, they'd be busy and focused on recording their new record.\n\nIt was announced on the band's Facebook page in 2015 that a new song, \"No Way Out,\" would debut on BBC Radio 1 on 17 May 2015. The band also revealed their fifth studio album to be titled \"Venom\" and their new bassist was going to be Jamie Mathias, formerly of metal band Revoker. \"Venom\" was set for release on 14 August 2015, the same day an expansive UK tour was announced. It was also revealed that Bullet For My Valentine will headline London's Camden Rocks festival which takes place on 30 May 2015.\n\nIn 2016, Bullet for My Valentine announced that drummer Michael Thomas will sit out for a few months to be with his wife as they were expecting their first child. Jason Bowld, former drummer of Pitchshifter and Tuck's bandmate from AxeWound, became Thomas' replacement. In April, they signed a new worldwide deal with Spinefarm Records. Matt Tuck later tweeted \"Here we go again. #BFMV6\" which implied the band had started working on their sixth effort. Later in the year the band released a new single titled \"Don't Need You\". A music video was released with the video as well.\n\nAt the end of 2017, Michael Thomas was replaced by Jason Bowld full-time.\n\nOn 1 April 2018 Bullet for My Valentine debuted a new song, \"Over It\", on BBC Radio 1. The song is the first single off their sixth studio album, \"Gravity\", which was confirmed for release on 29 June 2018. On 26 April 2018, the song \"Piece of Me\" was released. On 18 May, the band released another new song, \"Letting You Go\", and released a music video for the song on 3 June. On 15 October, the band released a music video for the track \"Not Dead Yet\".\n\nBullet for My Valentine has been described as metalcore, heavy metal, thrash metal, hard rock, emo, screamo, alternative metal, and post-hardcore. According to \"Decibel\", Bullet for My Valentine's music consists of \"'heavy metal' leads\" and \"'post-hardcore' vocals\". According to AllMusic, Bullet for My Valentine blend \"muscular riffs and emo harmonies\" and also \"take cues from '80s metal bands and punk-infused metal to make melodic, metallic, dark rock songs.\" The band describe two of their albums, \"The Poison\" and \"Fever\", as having a \"super dark\" tone.\n\nBullet for My Valentine member Matt Tuck said, \"…we're a hard rock band with metal influences, and I’ve said that from day one.\" Kirk Miller of \"Decibel\" praised the band for the effort in synchronised song structures. When asked of their views on their looks, members of the band have stated that they would not change their sound or image for a commercial approach; Tuck also said, \"Without sounding harsh, we're more interested in what our music sounds like than what our fucking hair looks like.\" Matt Tuck told \"Exclaim!\": \"A lot of people already think we're more of an emo band just because of the name of the band. People need to give the music a fair listen musically before they decide to judge it. I say we're a melodic metal band, really. That's how I'd describe us.\" Tuck said he prefers people call Bullet for My Valentine a heavy metal band instead of categorizing the band under specific subgenres. In an interview with Robert Gray from Ultimate-Guitar.com on 15 April 2010, Tuck said that when making the album \"Scream Aim Fire\", Bullet for My Valentine were bothered by critics and journalists who criticized the band and said the band aren't \"real metal\". Tuck said that the band tried to please people like critics and journalists with \"Scream Aim Fire\". Tuck said: \"\"Scream Aim Fire\" was an album we wrote to try to prove people wrong, and wasn't an album we made for ourselves. \"Fever\" is an album that was a hundred percent us; we didn't listen to anyone's opinions, what critics' opinions were, or what people thought we should do, or how we should sound.\" Tuck also said about \"Scream Aim Fire\": \"Some of it was written a hundred percent for us, but we tried a little bit too hard to be metal when we should've just carried on doing what we did really - like we did on all of \"The Poison\" material.\" When Tuck was asked if he defines Bullet for My Valentine as a heavy metal band or a hard rock band, Tuck said: \n\nBullet for My Valentine's influences include Judas Priest, Def Leppard, Mötley Crüe, Pantera, Iron Maiden, Metallica, Testament, Stuck Mojo, Megadeth, Slayer, Machine Head, Sepultura, Nirvana, Guns N' Roses, Queen, Led Zeppelin, and Dire Straits. \nAccording to Michael Thomas, these are the bands that inspire Bullet for My Valentine's \"catchy vocals, aggressive riffs and melodies,\" Matt Tuck has stated in an interview, his songwriting is highly influenced by Bruce Springsteen, Bob Seger and Bob Dylan. He goes on to say that \"these bands just are proper old school songwriters.\"\n\nCurrent\n\nFormer\n\nTimeline\n\n\n"}

Steenbock graduated from Wisconsin in 1916, where he was a member of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity.\n\nSteenbock was born in Charlestown, Wisconsin and grew up on a model farm outside New Holstein, Wisconsin. His graduate advisor at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, was Edwin B. Hart. His first publication reported the results of the single-grain experiment on which he assisted with Hart and Stephen Moulton Babcock. During his graduate career, Steenbock also served as an assistant in the lab of Elmer McCollum. When McCollum and another assistant Marguerite Davis published their discovery of what came to be called vitamin A, Steenbock thought he deserved more credit than he received. Steenbock carried on the vitamin A work in Madison, after McCollum accepted an offer from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nIn 1923, Steenbock demonstrated that irradiation by ultraviolet light increased the vitamin D content of foods and other organic materials. After irradiating rodent food, Steenbock discovered that the rodents were cured of rickets. It is now known that vitamin D deficiency is a cause of rickets.\n\nUsing $300 of his own money, Steenbock patented his invention. Steenbock's irradiation technique was used for food stuffs, but most memorably for milk. By the expiration of the patent in 1945, rickets had all but been eliminated.\n\nAfter receiving his patent, the Quaker Oats company offered $1 million (approximately $10 million today) for Steenbock's vitamin D technology. Steenbock thought twice about the offer. Instead of quickly selling his rights to a commercial company, Steenbock believed the money should be returned to the university.\n\nAfter soliciting interest from nine other University of Wisconsin–Madison alumni, Steenbock was influential in starting the first university technology transfer office, the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF). WARF's initial operating budget was $900, one hundred dollars from each of the nine alumni.\n\nOn February 19, 1927, WARF completed its first licensing agreement with the Quaker Oats company. The license permitted Quaker Oats to fortify its breakfast cereals with vitamin D. WARF went on to license the technology to pharmaceutical companies for a medical application, which was known as Viosterol.\n\nThe University of Wisconsin-Madison's Steenbock Memorial Library is named in his honor.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2213072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2213072", "title": "History of the MRT (Singapore)", "text": "History of the MRT (Singapore)\n\nThe history of the Mass Rapid Transit system of Singapore commenced with its planning in the 1960s, which finally led to its opening in 1987 with the launch of the 6 km section of the North South Line from Yio Chu Kang to Toa Payoh. It now has six lines in operation (as of 31 January 2020) with a total combined route length of and 122 stations. The Light Rail Transit which opened in 1999 acts as a feeder service to the MRT network.\n\nThe idea of constructing a rapid transit line in the country was initiated in 1967, when a four-year State and City Planning study conducted by the Singapore government and the United Nations Development Programme. It was part of an urban renewal and development project which aimed to formulate a long-term comprehensive concept plan for guiding the country's future physical development. It was concluded that physical land constraints faced by the island nation, was not able to accommodate more roads to meet the rise in transportation demands. It was noted that the city state needed a rail transit system by 1992.\n\nIt took 10 years since 1972 to design the MRT system, which continued all the way until the government gave permission to build the MRT.\n\nIn 1972, a team of consultants and professional officers seconded from the government embarked on a major transport study known as the Singapore Mass Transit Study. In phase one of the study, the team examined existing and future transport demands, analysed various options and made recommendations for government investment in public transportation. The team recommended the rail mass transit as the best option for meeting the anticipated travel demands of Singapore.\n\nPhase two of the study, which commenced in 1975, examined the technical, economic and financial feasibility of the mass transit system. This study argued that a bus-rail system was a \"superior alternative\" to an all-bus system, with only a remote chance of a disastrous result.\n\nDespite the study's recommendation for the development of a MRT system, the high costs involved and the possible impact on patterns of land use and economic activities prevented the government from making an immediate decision. The issue was complicated by a review of the phase two study by a team from the World Bank. The World Bank team had issues with the Singapore team's costing and assessment of the relative benefits of the bus-rail plan compared to an all-bus system.\n\nPhase three of the study was conducted between 1979 and 1980, and provided a preliminary engineering design for the recommended transit system. In 1980, a Provisional Mass Rapid Transit Authority was appointed to undertake preparatory work for the construction of a possible MRT system.\n\nDespite the findings of the mass transit studies, the government was still hesitant to commit to the MRT system. A team of foreign consultants (also known as the Harvard team) led by team leader Kenneth Hansen was engaged to review the previous mass transit and other transportation studies.\n\nIn their report, the Hansen team argued that the earlier studies were based on incorrect assumptions and thus failed to consider other approaches to solve Singapore's transport problems. Rather than a MRT system, the Hansen team recommended a high performance all-bus system coupled with feeder routes and motorcar restraint. Even if Singapore were to develop a MRT system, the team suggested that only one line be built as they believed that this would be sufficient to relieve traffic congestion and allow the bus system to function.\n\nWhen the late president Mr Ong Teng Cheong became the then-Minister for Communications (now the Ministry of Transport), he had to convince the cabinet in a debate in early 1980, that the S$ 5 billion needed for the system would be beneficial for the long-term development of Singapore. He argued that\n\nthis is going to be the most expensive single project to be undertaken in Singapore. The last thing that we want to do is to squander away our hard-earned reserves and leave behind enormous debt for our children and our grandchildren. Now since we are sure that this is not going to be the case, we'll proceed with the MRT, and the MRT will usher in a new phase in Singapore's development and bring about a better life for all of us.\n\nTherefore, a provisional Mass Rapid Transit Authority was established in July 1980, after the debate. However, Mr Ong faced strong opposition from other members of the cabinet, by Finance Minister Goh Keng Swee and Tony Tan, due especially to the heavy investments involved. A team of specialists from Harvard University, recommended that an all-bus system would be sufficient into the 1990s, and would cost 50% less than a rail-based system.\n\nLater on, two independent American transport and urban planning specialist teams were then appointed by the government to conduct their own independent reviews as part of the Comprehensive Traffic Study in 1981. This debate was also brought to national television in September 1980, which was rare at that time. The study came to a conclusion that an all-bus system would be inadequate as it would have to compete for road space which would have been increasingly overcrowded by then. The problem would be solved by building a rail system. Mr Ong hence declared in triumph on 28 May 1982, that\n\nthe Government has now taken a firm decision to build the MRT. The MRT is much more than a transport investment, and must be viewed in its wider economic perspective. The boost it'll provide to long term investors' confidence, the multiplier effect and how MRT will lead to the enhancement of the intrinsic value of Singapore's real estate are spin-offs that cannot be ignored.\n\nThe permission to begin the construction of Singapore's then-largest public works project was given in May 1982. A ground-breaking ceremony commenced the construction on 22 October 1983 at Shan Road. The majority of the work was expected to be completed in 1992. This included 67 km of track to be constructed, with 42 stations, of which 26 would be elevated, 1 at grade and 15 underground. The network was constructed in stages, with the North South Line given priority as the line passed through the Orchard Road corridor as well as the rest of the Central Area, the latter of which faced a high demand for public transport. Also, it was near the more densely populated housing estates such as Toa Payoh and Ang Mo Kio. The MRT Corporation, now Land Transport Authority, was established on 14 October 1983, taking over the roles and responsibilities of the former provisional Mass Rapid Transit Authority. On 6 August 1987, it set up SMRT Corporation.\n\nConstruction began in various areas:\n\nToa Payoh MRT station was the first to do structural works, followed by the tunnels between Outram Park and Tiong Bahru in 1985. The completion of the viaduct for Phase 1 was done on 15 December 1986 at Commonwealth MRT station. The first C151 train was delivered to MRT Corporation on 8 July 1986, by Yeo Ning Hong at Bishan Depot.\n\nOne third of the MRT was completed on 15 January 1985, and the Minister for Communications and Information Yeo Ning Hong visited Orchard MRT and Dhoby Ghaut MRT station sites. The pouring of concrete was completed by the end of 1985 at Dhoby Ghaut MRT station.\n\nOn 7 November 1987, the first 6 kilometres of the North South Line from Yio Chu Kang to Toa Payoh went into operation.\n\nthis is like a 20-year affair from conception to delivery. Now the baby is born, to say that I am happy and pleased is an understatement.\n\nNine more stations from Novena to Outram Park were officially opened 12 December 1987 by then Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong. These trains ran as a through service from one end to the other even though Tanjong Pagar and Outram Park were on the East West line.\n\nOn 12 March 1988, six more stations from Tiong Bahru to Clementi on the East West line were opened; trains now ran directly from Yio Chu Kang through the city to Clementi. On the same day, the system was officially launched by the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew, then Prime Minister of Singapore.\n\nThe rest of the system opened rapidly in stages. On 6 July 1990, with the last station opened, the entire system was opened by President Wee Kim Wee.\nLess than a year after the completion of the MRT project, the government announced in February 1991, intentions to extend the system to Woodlands. Construction commenced in 1993, and the 16 km, 6 station elevated line was opened on 10 February 1996 at a total cost of S$ 1.2 billion. With this extension, the North South Line included the three stations on the former Choa Chu Kang Branch Line (Jurong East, Bukit Batok, Bukit Gombak and Choa Chu Kang), forming a continuous line from Jurong East to Marina Bay.\n\nThe government came up with the proposal to build the Woodlands MRT line in 1990 when it announced its Woodlands MRT line construction plan, prioritizing the most than Changi Airport Line and the North East line. The proposal called for the extension of the existing North-South and East-West lines to connect Choa Chu Kang in the west to Yishun in the north. Many changes were subsequently made to the original plan. The changes were mainly to accommodate the 1991 Concept Plan by the Urban Redevelopment Authority, which aimed to make Woodlands a regional centre for northern Singapore. One of the changes was the number of MRT stations along the line. Due to the expected increase in the number of commuters in the Woodlands area, the government had to increase the number of MRT stations from four to the eventual six in order to serve a bigger and growing estate. The stations were also designed in a more user-friendly fashion. Most of the changes were incorporated by 1992. Woodlands New Town was only half completed, and Sembawang New Town was still in the planning stage at that time.\n\nIn the original plan, the Woodlands MRT line had only four stations: Admiralty, Woodlands, Marsiling and Yew Tee. They would service commuters in Choa Chu Kang North, Woodlands West, Woodlands Central and Woodlands East. Two more stations were added to the plan later to include Sembawang and Kadut Industrial Estate. Construction work was supposed to take place in two phases, with four stations opening first and the remaining two (Sembawang and Kadut) later. However, the government and the Mass Rapid Transit Corporation (MRTC; now known as SMRT Corporation) subsequently made the decision to open the Sembawang Station with those in the first phase. It was also decided that Kadut Station would be built at a later stage (depending on the development of housing plans in the area), as there was no immediate need for an MRT station there. Instead, a new station, Kranji, was added to the plan. The entire line was to be built above ground and would measure a total of 16 km. The eventual stations built were Yew Tee, Kranji, Marsiling, Woodlands, Admiralty and Sembawang to serve the estates of Choa Chu Kang North, Kadut Industrial Estate, Woodlands West, Woodlands Central, Woodlands East and Sembawang.\n\nIn 1991, the government awarded a contract, worth S$1.5 million, to Soil and Foundation Pte Ltd to conduct soil tests on the stretch of land between Chua Chu Kang and Yishun, through Woodlands, for the MRT line. The government then commissioned MRTC to begin work on the construction of the line in the latter part of 1991. The civil engineering construction contract, worth S$65.3 million, was awarded to a joint venture between Balfour Beatty of the United Kingdom and Gammon of Hong Kong, called the Balfour Beatty-Gammon venture. Meanwhile, the electrical and mechanical services contract, worth S$31.24 million, was awarded to General Electric Company of Singapore.\n\nThe contract for providing signalling and automatic train control systems was given to Westinghouse Signal Limited for S$33.32 million. A contract for the communications systems, worth $17 million, was awarded to a joint venture comprising JS Telecom, Thomson Surveillance Video and Halberthal, all French companies, and led by Singapore Electronic & Engineering Limited (SEEL). In total, MRTC pre-qualified 30 firms and joint ventures for six civil engineering contracts and one track-work contract. Construction work began at both ends of the line, on the Choa Chu Kang and Yishun stations, simultaneously.\n\nOne of the more difficult tasks during the course of the construction was a rock excavation work costing S$1.5 million along Woodlands Avenue 3, in which explosives were used to make way for the train viaduct. Another difficult project was the levelling of land covered in thick vegetation in Kadut, Woodlands and Sembawang. The laying of a 22-metre long concrete beam weighing 165 tonnes in October 1994 marked the completion of the structural link between the existing MRT network and the Woodlands extension line. The entire Woodlands extension line consists of around 1,163 beams. The tracks were then laid, followed by the installation of the electrical and mechanical systems and equipment. A real-time information system, costing S$400,000, was first introduced on the Woodlands MRT line. It provides passengers with train arrival times and informs them if trains are late or disrupted. The information is displayed on electronic boards installed at the entrance of each station.\n\nIn 1995, test runs were carried out on the completed Woodlands MRT line to ensure smooth operations. Open houses were held a week before the official opening for users to familiarise themselves with the new stations. The new Woodlands MRT line was officially opened by then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong on 10 February 1996. The first train took off at 1 pm during the opening ceremony. An estimated 12,000 people travelled on the Woodlands MRT line during the first hour of its opening.\n\nThe construction of the extension was not without political fallout. For a long time, the politicians representing residences in the North-East area of the island had been calling for the construction of a planned North East line. The announcement of the Woodlands Extension led to protests especially from opposition members of parliament, in particular from Chiam See Tong and Low Thia Khiang, representatives of Potong Pasir and Hougang constituencies respectively, with both areas potentially benefiting from such a line. The opposition members accused the government of favouring the Woodlands Extension over the North East line due to opposition representation in the north-east area, arguing that there were far more residents in the north-east compared to the north, and questioned the rationale of building the Woodlands extension when the north was relatively undeveloped.\n\nDover, built on the East West line between Clementi and Buona Vista, was officially opened on 18 October 2001 by then Minister for Transport, Mr Yeo Cheow Tong. The first station to be built over an operating rail line with no disruptions to train services (although trains drove by the site at a reduced speed during the construction phase), it was also the first elevated station with two side platforms on either side of the tracks, as opposed to having an island platform as in all other elevated stations.\n\nAdjacent to the Singapore Polytechnic on one side, and undeveloped land on the other, the building of the station was met with reservations by some members of the public over its low catchment area. There were criticisms over the spending of \"taxpayers' money\" chiefly for use only by students of one educational institution. The government proceeded with the construction anyway, citing the catchment area extends to public housing flats on either end of the polytechnic, and that the undeveloped land opposite is slated for extensive development, largely residential in nature. This station has indeed brought much convenience to the students at the polytechnic.\n\nFor a long time following its opening in 1981, Singapore Changi Airport relied on taxis and buses as the primary means of public transportation to the rest of the country. They served the airport well, but concerns over competition from other regional airports, some of which feature quick rail-based services to their city centres, such as the one from Kuala Lumpur International Airport, accelerated the government's plan to build a rail link to the airport.\n\nProvision had long been made for a new line branching off from the existing East West line at the Tanah Merah, with some conceptual plans showing a tentative route alignment to the airport along Airport Boulevard, continuing beyond the airport to Changi Point, before turning southwest back toward the city along the east coast of the island. The plans were finally announced by then Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on 15 November 1996. However, the route alignment showed a deviation from previous plans.\n\nThe final plan involved building only the first two stations, namely Expo, an elevated station directly adjacent to the Singapore Expo, and Changi Airport, an underground station built between Terminal Two and the since constructed Terminal Three. The alignment of the station at the airport was switched perpendicularly to an East-west direction, such that stairs and escalators lead to two of the terminals directly from either end of the station. Construction began on December 1998.\nExpo opened on 10 January 2001, sporting a \"space age\" architecture designed by world-renowned architect Sir Norman Foster. The roof is clad in titanium and its design enabled the platform to be free of any columns, freeing up space in a station which will be used by thousands of visitors to the massive 100,000 square metre Singapore Expo next door.\n\nChangi Airport was opened on 8 February 2002, giving the airport its first rail link after less than 21 years of operations. Initially through services were operated from the airport to Boon Lay at the other end of the East West line, however due to ridership falling below expectations the service was reverted to shuttle mode in 2003.\n\nThe North East line, the first line operated by SBS Transit and among the first fully automated heavy rail lines in the world, opened on 20 June 2003, except for Woodleigh and Buangkok stations. System problems delayed the line six months from the scheduled opening date of December 2002. The construction period of the North East line was fraught with many delays and some budget problems. It marked the pinnacle of a long and chequered history of over two decades since the conception of the line had taken place along with that of the original system which was eventually completed in 1990.\n\nUp to May 2005, the line was running at a deficit. Although line operator, SBS Transit, managed a yearly overall profit as profits from its public bus service exceed the losses from its operation of the North East line. Running from HarbourFront where Singapore's former World Trade Centre building lies to Punggol to the northeast of the island, this line allowed for previously isolated or distanced areas to be linked up with the rest of Singapore by rail. Buangkok opened on 15 January 2006 and Woodleigh opened on 20 June 2011.\n\nOn 28 May 2009, 5.6 km of the Circle Line opened from Bartley to Marymount. On 17 April 2010, another 11.1 km of the Circle Line from Bartley to Dhoby Ghaut commenced operation. On 8 October 2011, the remaining 16.6 km from Marymount to HarbourFront commenced operation, marking the full completion of the line which took 10 years to complete, primarily delayed due to the Nicoll Highway collapse. On 14 January 2012, the 2.4 km of the Circle Line extension from Promenade to Marina Bay commenced operation.\n\nThe Downtown Line is the fifth Mass Rapid Transit line in Singapore and opened in three stages, on 22 December 2013, 27 December 2015 and 21 October 2017 respectively. When fully completed, the line will be about long with 36 stations and serve about half a million commuters daily, making it the longest underground and driverless MRT line in Singapore. Travelling from one end to the other will take about 65 minutes.\n\nOn 15 August 2014, the Downtown Line 3 Extension was announced, in conjunction with the announcement of the Thomson-East Coast MRT Line. Two additional stations, Xilin MRT station and Sungei Bedok MRT station will be added to the Downtown Line, with Sungei Bedok as an interchange station with the Thomson-East Coast Line. It will add an additional 2.2 km to the line with the extension. Due in 2024, Stage 3 will join the current East West and future Thomson-East Coast lines that runs through Marine Parade.\n\nOn 31 January 2020, 2.8 km of the Thomson–East Coast Line opened from Woodlands North to Woodlands South.\n\nOn 28 February 2009, the 3.8 kilometre Boon Lay Extension to the East West line comprising 2 stations Pioneer and Joo Koon commenced passenger service. Construction had begun in December 2004 after the development of Pioneer New Town had been completed. Similarly, construction began for the Marina South Pier in December 2009 and completed in September 2014, it began operations on 23 November 2014.\n\nThe 7.5 kilometre Tuas West Extension (TWE) – Gul Circle, Tuas Crescent, Tuas West Road and Tuas Link – opened for passenger service on 18 June 2017.\n\nAll train services are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, due to the drop of ridership, coupled with full home-based learning for students and closure of workplaces and several services. These include frequency reduction, early closure and staggered closures.\n\nThe MRT was a very recent addition for Singapore and as such, the authorities wanted to keep the MRT map as easy to use for Singaporeans as possible. Hence, each direction of travel was colour-coded in a different colour as though it were a line on its own. In that way, confusion in decision-making when taking a certain line in a certain direction would be reduced for passengers. However, this reduced the number of colours available for new lines and was not in line with international practice.\n\nPreviously, each direction of travel on the MRT was denoted on system maps as a different colour.\n\nEach station was also assigned a unique alphanumeric code, with the alphabet indicating which part of the island the station lies at (North, East, West, Central, Marina Bay region or Choa Chu Kang Branch Line) and the numbers (in ascending order from the centre of the island) indicating which part of that region the station is located at.\nThese were superseded in 2001 by two-digit codes as the latter might be exhausted with new MRT and LRT lines added to the network, thus only having 15 letters in total. However, \"E\", \"N\" and \"W\" were still found on viaduct pillars of the MRT and some traffic signals on the Westinghouse FS2000 signalling system (before upgrading to Thales SelTrac CBTC GoA 3 signalling system), but the \"A\" is still being used for the Changi Airport branch line. The codes for viaduct pillars are:\n\nThe colour and alphanumeric codes for each direction of travel remained unchanged, except that with the opening of the Woodlands Extension (connecting Yishun station to Choa Chu Kang station), the Jurong East – Choa Chu Kang Branch Line ceased to exist. As such, the formerly Northbound Choa Chu Kang Branch Line services in khaki travelled southbound to Marina Bay & as such were denoted as red while the formerly Southbound Choa Chu Kang Branch Line services in brown originated from Marina Bay, hence having travelled northbound it was denoted as yellow. The alphanumeric codes for these stations were also replaced. After Sembawang it is N14-N18, N20-N23, with the exception of N13 and N19, reserved for future stations Canberra and Sungei Kadut. The B1-B3 was renumbered to N21-N23.\n\nThe Bukit Panjang LRT opened in 1999 and was given the colours purple and orange to represent its direction of travel. Due to the alignment of the route, which was a loop track around Bukit Panjang New Town, the map was different. The stations were given the alphanumeric code A1 to A14, with numbering starting from Choa Chu Kang interchange and going anti-clockwise direction on the loop. The directional arrow on the shared service track (between stations A1 to A6) was split, half purple coloured and half orange coloured. From Bukit Panjang station, the orange arrows travelled in an anti-clockwise direction [(service B) via Petir] while the purple arrows travelled in a clockwise direction (service A) towards Senja. These were standardised into grey colour since 2001 because of additional LRT lines such as Sengkang and Punggol LRT.\n\nAs there were plans to expand the network, the MRT System Map could no longer afford to have each direction of travel represented by a different colour. The map was revamped to have one colour as there would be more MRT lines in the future, which was announced by the Minister of Communications and Information Technology, Mr Yeo Cheow Tong. The pilot trials for new signages were done at Dover and at the North East line.\n\nColours were used to represent each line rather than each direction of travel, cutting the usage of colours by half and preserving other colours for future lines.\n\nThe direction of travel was instead represented by numbers contained within a coloured circle located at the ends of each line, known as the destination number.\n\nLike before, each station was assigned a unique alphanumeric symbol. However under this revamped system map, the letter in each symbol denotes the line instead and the number increases in ascending order from East to West (East West line), North to South (North South Line), South West to North East (North East line), in an anti-clockwise direction (Circle Line), in a clockwise direction from the North-west to the South-east (Downtown Line), and from the Thomson stretch in the North to the East Coast stretch in the East (Thomson-East Coast). Interchange stations will then have at least two or three codes.\n\nSpecial codes were also used to denote the town centre. \"STC\" is Sengkang Town Centre and \"PTC\" is Punggol Town Centre.\nFor example:\n\nDuring a visit to the upcoming Thomson–East Coast MRT line stations in Woodlands, a redesigned MRT map was launched on 11 December 2019 by the Land Transport Authority to make it easier for commuters to plan their journeys. The new map will feature the Circle MRT line as a focal point on the map, as well as prominent landmarks and waterbodies added to the surrounding areas. In addition, QR codes are included with links to a fare calculator and maps in all four languages. The new map has since been made available to all MRT and LRT stations on 31 January 2020.\n\nThe public announcement system in all SMRT operated lines was introduced in 1994, beginning with the announcement of station names when a train arrives at the station. The door closing announcement was later added in 1997 and the next station announcement in 1999. Over time, however, some sections of the announcements were modified, and finally, the entire announcement system was changed in January 2008 in preparation for the installation of STARIS on all trains later that year. The new announcement system features a new voice, and a new chime before each announcement.\n\nThe original announcements were made by the late Juanita Melson and contained information on how to purchase single journey tickets as well as how to obtain the deposit back, for the benefit of the tourists. This was eventually removed when the announcement system was upgraded with the current announcer, Chan Hui Yuh. Only the late Juanita Melson announcements are now being operated on the Bukit Panjang LRT when used on the BPLRT trains.\n\nAll announcements on the NSEWL were changed again in October 2012 but was met by strong criticism by the public after Chinese announcements were included. This was eventually removed on all trains by December 2012.\n\nThe North East line and the Downtown line, which are both operated by SBS Transit Ltd, features different announcements from SMRT operated lines. It features different chimes and a different announcer, as well as next station messages in Chinese, and in some cases, Malay and Tamil.\n\nWhen the MRT opened in 1987, fares ranged from S$0.50 to S$1.10 in S$0.10 increments for all adult tickets, regardless of whether they were single-trip or stored-value tickets. Several discounted fares were available: senior citizens and permanent residents above the age of 60 could travel on a flat fare of S$0.50 during off-peak hours; children below the height of 1.2 metres and full-time students in primary, secondary, pre-university and vocational training (VITB) institutions paid a flat fare of S$0.30 at all times.\n\nMagnetic strip plastic tickets were used, in various forms. Stored-value tickets were called \"farecards\" and came in three types: the blue farecard was issued to adults, the magenta farecard to senior citizens, and the red farecard to children. Single-trip forms of these tickets were retained at the faregates on exiting the paid area of a destination station. Monthly discounted tickets were available in four values: beige, pink, and purple tickets for primary and tertiary students, and full-time national servicemen came with a value of S$13, S$30 and S$36, respectively; the peach ticket was for secondary, pre-university and VITB students, costing S$17 each. These discounted tickets were valid for a month from the date of purchase, allowed up to four trips a day, and were non-transferable.\n\nTheir farecards cannot be used from 1 December 2002 and support has been terminated since June 2003 with the removal of metal holes and convert validators to printing tickets (by cash). It is currently no longer workable.\n\nThe EZ-Link card is a contactless smart card, initially based on Sony's FeliCa smartcard technology. The cards are mainly used for the payment of transportation fares, but may also be used for payment at selected retail outlets. Established in 2002, the technology was promoted as the means for speedier and more convenient transactions and as well as being an efficient method of reducing fare evasion, although there have been some cases of overcharging users. As a benchmark, fares range from S$0.70 to S$3.20 for adults, S$0.70 to S$1.35 for senior citizens, and S$0.40 to S$0.50 for student EZ-Link cards. Patrons using an EZ-Link card receive a discount for their journey, including a discount if they use a connecting bus after their MRT ride.\n\nThe General Ticketing Machines (GTMs) at each station which replaced the older ticketing machines, allow commuters to purchase additional credit to add to their EZ-Link cards or to purchase tickets for single trips. Fares for these single trip tickets are higher than those for EZ-Link cards. In addition, a S$1.00 refundable ticket deposit is charged for each Standard Ticket. This refund can be collected from any General Ticketing Machine so as long as the card is returned to the machine within 30 days of purchase. The card can also be deposited into a charity collection box, with the S$1 deposit going to charity. The rationale behind such a refundable deposit feature was that the smartcard technology contained within each Standard Ticket makes each one costly enough to necessitate the recycling of Standard Tickets. Since November 2007, external readers were installed on GTMs at stations operated by SMRT Corporation to address problems of card jamming in insert slots. The slots, however, remain in use for the purpose of refunding Standard Ticket deposits.\n\nConcession fares are available for children, students, senior citizens and national servicemen. Students are given free personalised cards, complete with their photos, names and national identification numbers. Regardless of its type, each card is assigned a unique card ID that can be used to recover the card if lost. Transport operators have organised lotteries that are based on these card IDs. The \"Singapore Tourist Pass\" offers unlimited travel for tourists on Singapore's public transport system. For S$8 a day, tourists can take any number of rides on buses and trains operated by SBS Transit, SMRT Buses and SMRT Trains.\n\nThe old EZ-Link card can be used up to September 2009 where the old EZ-Link card usage became limited support. It remains on some MRT stations.\n\nOn 26 August 2008, Land Transport Authority announced a two-month trial of the new generation Contactless ePurse Application (CEPAS) card that was developed in-house. It is intended to standardise the technology of cashless payment, allowing for use on public transport, Electronic Road Pricing (ERP), everyday shopping and meals. The card has replaced this generation of EZ-Link cards in 2009 and aims to encourage competition by allowing up to four CEPAS card issuers. Mass replacement of the old Sony FeliCa cards to the new CEPAS cards went on at TransitLink Ticket offices and Singapore Post outlets till 7 October 2009.\nOn 29 February 2009, two new stations were added at the end of the line, the stations were Pioneer and Joo Koon. Joo Koon became the main terminal for the East West Line instead of Boon Lay MRT Station.\n\nThe plasma displays which is easier for elderly and wheelchair passengers. The displays announced a train's terminating station when it arrives (or otherwise, a \"Do Not Board\" warning), although the disadvantage was that it could not tell the duration of a train's arrival time (e.g. the train will arrive at Jurong East Station in 2 mins). The second generation of such displays installed at stations along the Woodlands Extension featured a slightly updated version where the time till the next train arrival would be displayed from 3 minutes prior to the train's arrival.\n\nThe Nicoll Highway collapse was a construction accident that occurred at approximately 3.30 pm on 20 April 2004 in Singapore when a tunnel being constructed for use by Mass Rapid Transit trains collapsed. The tunnel was part of the construction of the underground Circle line, near the Nicoll Highway. The supporting structure for the deep excavation work failed, resulting in a 30-metre (100 ft) deep cave-in that spread across six lanes of Nicoll Highway. The collapse killed four people and injured three. The accident has delayed the construction end date for the MRT station.\n"}

He won four Grand Slam singles titles as well as three doubles titles. He was coached by Mercer Beasley.\n\nParker was born on January 31, 1916 in Milwaukee as Franciszek Andrzej Pajkowski and had three brothers and a sister. He learnt to play tennis at age 10, hitting discarded tennis balls at the Milwaukee Town Club. There he was discovered by the club coach Mercer Beasley who noticed his quickness and accuracy. Aged 12, he won his first national title, the boys' indoor championship played at the Seventh Regiment Armory in New York. At age 15, Paikowski become the national boys' champion in singles, defeating Gene Mako in the final, and a year later, at age 16, he won the national junior singles title as well as the singles title at the Canadian National Championships. In 1933, when he was 17, he won the singles title at the U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships, defeating Gene Mako in the final in straight sets.\n\nParker is one of the few Americans to win both the French Championships (1948, 1949) and the U.S. Championships (1944, 1945).\n\nParker became the singles champion at Cincinnati, then called the \"Tri–State Tennis Tournament\" in 1941 and was a four-time singles finalist (1932, 1933, 1938, 1939). He won the Canadian title in 1938. He was ranked World No. 1 in 1948 by John Olliff of \"The Daily Telegraph\".\n\nWriting about Parker in his 1949 autobiography, Bobby Riggs, who had played Parker many times, says \"Parker is a tough man to get past. Equipped with a wonderful all-court game, he plays intently and with classic form. His footwork is marvelous. You never see Frankie hitting the ball from an awkward position.\" Jack Kramer, however, writing in his own autobiography, says \"...even as a boy [Parker] had this wonderful slightly overspin forehand drive. Clean and hard. Then for some reason, Frankie's coach, Mercer Beasley, decided to change this stroke into a chop. It was obscene.\" It also impaired his game, particularly in preventing him from getting to the net, and Parker dropped in the rankings. A few years later, however, he worked hard to regain his original forehand, and according to Kramer, did indeed greatly improve his stroke. But it was never again as good as it had once been. Parker was known for having a \"deadpan\" persona on court.\n\nParker took part in the 1968 US Open at the age of 52, becoming the oldest player to compete in the US Open men's singles. He also had the longest span in Grand Slam men's singles history (36 years from his first appearance at the U.S. Championships in 1932 to his last appearance in 1968).\n\nBetween 1937 and 1948, Parker took part in seven Davis Cup ties with the US team and won the Davis Cup in 1937 and 1948. He compiled a Davis Cup record of 12 wins and two losses.\n\nIn October 1949, Parker signed a one-year contract with Bobby Riggs to become a professional tennis player.\n\nParker was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1960.\n\nParker was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island in 1966 and into the National Polish American Sports Hall of Fame in 1988.\n\nOn March 17, 1938, Parker married Audrey Beasley who previously divorced Parker's coach Mercer Beasley. She became his adviser and tailored his tennis wardrobe. His wife died in 1971, and in 1979, Parker retired from his position of salesman for a corrugated box company.\n\nParker joined the professional tennis circuit in 1949 and as a consequence was banned from competing in the amateur Grand Slams until the start of the Open Era.\n\n(A*) 1-set matches in preliminary rounds.\n\n\n"}

It is classified as a dialect of Occitan and a sub-dialect of Vivaro-Alpine, with some strong influence from the neighbouring Intemelian Ligurian dialect spoken from Ventimiglia to San Remo.\n\nMentonasc is considered to be a transitional language; it is an intermediate language between Occitan and Ligurian, which is why the classification of Mentonasc is often debated. However, it is traditionally assigned to the Occitan language by french scholars and to Ligurian dialects by Italian scholars.\n\nThe Mentonasc dialect bears strong similarities with the common alpine dialects, such as, Royasque or Pignasque. It differs quite significantly especially in the ear from Ligurian coastal dialects (Northern Italian), like those of Ventimiglia (Intemelio dialect) or Monaco.\n\nWhen the area of Menton was part of the Republic of Genoa and later of the Kingdom of Sardinia, Mentonasc was used in all of the coastal area between Monaco and Ventimiglia, and in the hinterland. \n\nIn the 19th century Mentonasc was used in the territories of the \"Free Cities of Menton & Roquebrune\", an independent statelet created in connection with the Italian Risorgimento.\n\nWhen France annexed the Free Cities in 1861, Mentonasc began its decline, substituted by the French language.\n\nThe Mentonasc dialect is currently spoken by about 10% of the population in Menton, Roquebrune, and the surrounding villages (Castellar, Castillon, Gorbio, Sainte-Agnès, Moulinet and Sospel). Now the language is being taught within the French educational system, as a variety of Niçard (i.e. Provençal and Occitan), so this may change.\n\nNo countries currently have Mentonasc as an official language.\n\nBelow is a chart of some nouns and verbs found in French, translated into Mentonasc.\n\nThere are some texts and songs that have been published recently in Menton (most from the twentieth century.)\n\nAmong the various publications: \"A Lambrusca de Paigran\" (la Vigne vierge de Grand-père) by Jean-Louis Caserio, illustrations by M. and F.

{"id": "2213100", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2213100", "title": "Nancy School", "text": "Nancy School\n\nThe Nancy School was a French hypnosis-centered school of psychotherapy. The origins of the thoughts were brought about by Ambroise-Auguste Liébeault in 1866, in Nancy, France. Through his publications and therapy sessions he was able to gain the attention/support from Hippolyte Bernheim: another Nancy Doctor that further evolved Liébeault's thoughts and practices to form what is known as the Nancy School.\n\nIt is referred to as the Nancy School to distinguish it from the antagonistic \"Paris School\" that was centred on the hysteria-centred hypnotic research of Jean-Martin Charcot at the Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris.\n\nLiébeault was born to a peasant family in Farrières France. While expected to become a priest, he rather started his medical studies at Strasbourg, where he obtained his medical degree in 1850. At Strasbourg, he stumbled upon an old book about animal magnetism and became fascinated with it.\n\nHe moved to Nancy, France in 1860 and opened up his own clinic. Having finally established a successful practice, his thoughts turned back to that book on animal magnetism and he decided to start experimenting with hypnotic therapies. He did this by offering his patients a strange bargain: they could either continue their standard methods of treatment and continue their usual fee or they could be treated hypnotically, through suggestion, for free. Naturally, at first, many patients stayed with their standard methods because hypnosis at this time was still controversial. As more and more patients started receiving the hypnotic treatment and spreading news of its success, Liébeault became known as \"Good Father Liébeault.\" \n\nIn 1866 he published his first book titled \"Le sommeil et les états analogues, considérés surtout du point de vue de l'action du moral sur le physigue\" (Sleep and its analogous states considered from the perspective of the action of the mind upon the body) that focused on the similarities between induced sleep (or trance) and natural sleep, the features of the hypnotic state, how the induction of sleep relates to the nervous system, and the phenomena of hallucinations. Within this theory, he labeled the key difference between sleep and the hypnotic state to be \"produced by suggestion and concentration on the idea of sleep and that the patient was \"en rapport\" with the hypnotist.\" This book was largely ignored by the medical profession due to the fact that it was obscurely written and sold very few copies. However, Liébeault's theory on the hypnotic state that he devised within this book engrossed the attention of a prominent Nancy doctor, and soon to be student of Liébeault himself, Hippolyte Bernheim.,\n\nBernheim, born in Alsace, received his medical degree from Strasbourg for internal medicine, specializing in heart disease and typhoid fever., From hearing of the reputation Liébeault was establishing with his work in hypnosis and from reading his first publication, Bernheim skeptically visited the hypnotic clinic to see for himself if all of the stories he had been hearing were true. His amazement of what was happening led him to regularly visit the clinic to lean Liébeault's methods, and eventually to abandon his practice with internal medicine to become a full-time hypnotherapist. Bernheim humbly became a student of Liébeault and eventually came to study the hypnotic state with him as a colleague.\n\nBernheim was able to bring Liébeault's ideas about suggestibility into the attention of the medical world. His focus was on the patients rather than the hypnotist because he believed that the patients held the important factors to be hypnotized. He believed that every human being has the trait of suggestibility but each just varied to the degree of which. This idea became a staple in the train of thought of the Nancy doctors. He wrote these thoughts and others, like how \"suggestible patients could be successfully treated by straightforward persuasion techniques as well as by hypnosis,\" in his book \"De la Suggestion et de ses Applications à la Thérapeutique\" (Suggestive Therapeutics).\nAlthough Bernheim was the leading proponent of suggestion accounting for hypnotic phenomena, he never took full credit for it all. He argued that \"while suggestion was proposed by Abbé Faria, and was applied by James Braid, it was perfected by Liébeault.\"\n\nLiébeault and his followers did not agree with the views of Charcot and the Salpêtrière hospital's school of thought. In fact they were opposed to the ideas of the hysteria-centered school of thought that was the hallmark of Jean-Martin Charcot's Paris school. Instead they believed that:\nThey believed that the deeply hypnotized subject responds automatically to suggestion before his intellectual centers have had time to bring their inhibitory action into play.\n\nLiebeault, Bernheim, and the school in Nancy believed that hypnosis was due to the physiological property in the brain of suggestibility. Bernheim discovered that if he gave a subject a suggestion to return to him at ten o'clock in 13 days while under hypnosis, the subject would show up at the exact time Bernheim had suggested. The subject showed no recollection of receiving a suggestion, and stated that the \"idea presented itself to his mind only at the moment at which he was required to execute it.\" In Bernheim's \"Latent Memories and Long-Term Suggestions\", he proposed that post-hypnotic suggestions were a result of his subjects periodically falling into a hypnotic state and remembering the suggestions they received from him while previously under hypnosis. Below is a description of one of his experiments on post-hypnotic suggestion.\n\"To one, I tell her during her sleep:—\"Next Thursday (in five days) you will take the glass that is on the night table and put it in the suitcase that is at the foot of your bed.\" Three days later, having put her back to sleep, I say to her: \"Do you remember what I ordered you to do?\" She answers: \"Yes, I must put the glass in my suitcase Thursday morning, at eight o'clock.\"—\"Have you thought about it since I told you?\"—\"No\"—\"Think hard.\"—\"I thought about it the following morning at eleven o'clock.\"—\"Were you awake or asleep?\"—\"I was in a drowsy state.\" (Bernheim, 1886a, pp. 109–110)\"\nBernheim theorized that memories of suggestions subjects received under hypnosis were not unconscious, instead they were latent, or dorminant until it is revived when the subject drifts into a hypnotic state.\n\nOn the other hand Charcot was the director of the Paris's large Salpetriere Hospital. He claimed that \"hypnotizability and hysteria were aspects of the same underlying abnormal neurological condition.\" Therefore, he doubted the view of the Nancy school: that hypnotic susceptibility was a normal characteristic. Instead, \"Charcot speculated that the root cause of hysteria lay in a hereditary, progressive, and generalized degeneracy of the nervous system that interferes with the ability to integrate and interconnect memories and ideas in the normal way.\" While studying hysteria in Charcot's famous patient Lucie, Charcot and Janet theorized that all post-hypnotic suggestions were performed by a \"dissociated consciousness\". They came to this conclusion because when Lucie would have symptoms of hysteria, she would recall childhood fears. Janet then used this research as evidence that tramautic events of the past lead to the onset of symptoms of hysteria which resulted in a dissociated conscious that was expressed in hypnotic neurosis. Charcot believed that hypnotic neurosis could be described to follow three stages: catalepsy, lethargy, and somnambulism. These ideas were implemented into Charcot's grand theory of hypnotism. The theory of grand hypnotism was presented by Charcot to the French scientific organization and was accepted as a legitimate study.\n\nBernheim countered Charcot, by stating that provoked sleep was simply a consequence of suggestion. This was the exact opposite of the belief held by Charcot that suggestion was due to provoked sleep from the disorder of hypnotic neurosis. Bernheim believed that the \"..automatic execution of suggested acts could happen while awake and without somnambulism.\" He stated that \"Sleep, which suspends the power of will and reasoning, merely facilitated the brain's acceptance of the suggested idea.\" This idea led Bernheim to accuse Charcot of \"creating a cultural hysteria\" at the Salpêtrière hospital that was in fact due to the suggestion and charisma of Charcot's showmanship. Bernheim pointed out that Charcot's subjects were aware of what was expected of them while under hypnosis, Charcot and his colleagues even discussed what they expected of the patient in front of them. This included Charcot's convulsions which he implemented as a hallmark symptom of hypnotic neurosis. Charcot's hysteria-stricken subjects gained much popularity in the hospital at Paris, and in turn the entire country.\n\nIn the end, around 1891 the Salpetriere protagonists admitted openly that they have been wrong. \"Charcot too, admitted his errors on hypnotism and privately predicted that his theories of hysteria would not long survive him\" Besides his mistakes, \"Charcot was among the first to explore interactions between emotional and physical factors, and he raised the important subjects of hysteria and hypnosis out of scientific obscurity\"\n\nOne of the first influential researchers of hypnotism was Indo-Portuguese monk, Abbé Faria. He was a pioneer of the scientific study of hypnotism who believed hypnosis worked purely through the power of suggestion.\n\nThe Scottish surgeon James Braid, focused on the susceptibility of the subjects and not on what the hypnotist was doing. By doing this Braid was able to make a revolutionary observation and conclusion by having his subjects stare at and concentrate on a shiny object. He notice that \"the staring paralyzed the eye muscles, he concluded, and the fixed attention weakened the mind, resulting in an unusual state of the nervous system, halfway between sleep and wakefulness.\" \n\nFrom this conclusion Braid announced this discovery as being neurohypnology, or nervous sleep. Braid also proposed that hypnosis would and could have a number of clinical uses, including being useful for surgical anaesthesia; all of which helped pave the way for the establishment of scientific hypnotism—and, because Braid approached hypnotism as a scientist and natural philosopher, he was able to move hypnotism beyond controversy and mystery, and give it a respectable face.\n\nBernheim was a great asset to Liébeault's studies and research on hypnotism. Unlike Liébeault, Bernheim was proficient at writing effectively and communicating all of their elaborate ideas. In the book \"Pioneers of Psychology\", it states that \"Bernheim was effective at elaborating these ideas in several books and articles that came to be identified as the main statements of the Nancy school.\"\n\nThe research and theories produced by the Nancy School has had a great impact on our society today. Multiple research studies have been tested to show that these techniques are safe and effective in certain situations. D. Barrett stated that it is also \"becoming clear that the skills one needs to respond to hypnosis are similar to those necessary to experience trance-like states in daily life.\" According to K. Cherry, \"the technique has also been clinically proven to provide medical and therapeutic benefits, most notably in the reduction of pain and anxiety. It has even been suggested that hypnosis can reduce the symptoms of dementia.\" While reading through articles and research, hypnosis can affect people differently depending on their state of mind. Experiments today have given us enough information to show that hypnosis and the power of suggestion can help with certain problems in daily life; whether it be trying to quit smoking or to relieve the pain of consistent headaches.\n\nThere were many influential people in the history of psychology that have been themselves influenced by Nancy School and the concept that it believed in. With this influence many of these psychology figures have been able to accomplish great things for psychology. These figures include, but are not limited to:\n\nHistory of hypnosis\n\n\n"}

The film won a National Film Award and two Filmfare Awards South, and was featured in international film festivals.\n\nIndian Peace Keeping Force soldier Major Bala is fighting in war-torn Sri Lanka and loses his right leg in an explosion caused by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. Elsewhere, sisters Sowmya and Meenakshi (Meenu) are living in a Chettiar mansion in Karaikudi, Tamil Nadu, with their mother Padma, maternal grandfather Chandrasekhar, maidservant Chellatha and younger sister Kamala. Sowmya is a school principal while Meenu is passionate about classic Tamil poetry, music and dance.\n\nBala, a rich man, becomes a depressed and alcohol-dependent after losing his leg but he quits drinking after an argument with Meenu, with whom he falls in love and supports her family when in need.

In November 1998, Menon announced he had begun pre-production work on a project titled \"Theekkul Viralai Vaithal\", a title taken from a line by Subramania Bharati. The initial idea of the film came from a conversation between Menon and director Mani Ratnam about the contrast between Menon's life and that of his brother. While Menon entered the film industry, his brother focused on an academic career and later became an officer in the Indian Railway Accounts Service. Ratnam later suggested Menon should make a film on the subject.\n\nMenon wrote a screenplay based on the Jane Austen novel \"Sense and Sensibility\" and the project was renamed \"Kandukondain Kandukondain\". The title was inspired by the phrase \"kanden kanden Seethaiyai kanden\" from Kambar's epic \"Kamba Ramayanam\". Menon said the film's story of two sisters was reminiscent of those of him and his brother during difficult parts of their lives. The film was initially launched as a project in Tamil, Telugu, Hindi and Malayalam, though it was only released in Tamil with a subsequent dubbed version in Telugu titled \"Priyuraalu Pilichindi\". Menon first wrote the story in English then dictated the dialogue in Malayalam; this was then translated into Tamil by Sujatha.\n\nIn November 1999, when most of the production was complete, Menon—whose previous film performed poorly in rural areas—wanted to show a rough copy of \"Kandukondain Kandukondain\" to a village audience to ensure they could relate to the subject. After showing parts of the film to audiences in Udumalpettai and Pollachi, the team later held a group discussion before thanking the volunteers with gifts while receiving positive feedback.\n\nTabu was the first actor to be cast in the film; she was cast in the role of the elder sister Sowmya and Revathi was signed to dub for her character. The casting of the younger sister Meenakshi took longer to finalise; Menon initially approached Manju Warrier, who liked the script but was hesitant to commit to appear in the film. He next discussed the role with Soundarya, whose team wanted to read the script before committing to the project. Because Menon was still finalising the climax, he opted to explore other options. Aishwarya Rai was then signed onto the project, making her third appearance in Tamil films after roles in Mani Ratnam's \"Iruvar\" (1997) and Shankar's \"Jeans\" (1998). Despite being replete with Hindi film offers, Rai said she was a large fan of Menon's work and could strongly identify with the character, and accepted the offer. Menon and writer Sujatha presented two points of view in the female leads; while Sowmya accepts her destiny, Meenakshi wants to make her own life choices. While finalising the character arc of Sowmya, Menon drew inspiration from a person with whom he was familiar.\n\nInitially Menon cast Prabhu Deva, the lead actor of his previous film, in a leading role. Deva had played a key role in introducing Menon to producer Thanu but soon left the project. For the role of a former army general, Menon attempted to cast Parthiban but the actor's difficult relationship with Thanu meant they could not collaborate. Arjun Sarja was also approached but he was working in a different film genre during the period. Eventually, Menon cast Malayalam actor Mammootty in the role. Abbas was cast in the lead role of a young businessman while Vikram dubbed for his character.\n\nMenon approached Prashanth to appear in the film but the actor demanded to be paired opposite Rai rather than Tabu. Menon did not want to switch the female lead actors and decided not to cast Prashanth. In January 1999, Rajiv Menon met and narrated the script of \"Kandukondain Kandukondain\" to Ajith Kumar, who had been recovering from back surgery; Kumar agreed to portray the struggling film director character. While writing the character, Menon was inspired by his experiences as a junior technician looking to make a breakthrough in the film industry. Between signing for \"Kandukondain Kandukondain\" and its release in May 2000, Ajith Kumar had significantly expanded his box-office appeal through the commercial success of his other films.\n\nSrividya was signed to play the mother of Tabu and Rai while Shamili (Anjali, 1990) played their sister. Nizhalgal Ravi and debutant Anita Ratnam were also cast in the film with Malayalam actor Unnikrishnan Namboothiri making his debut as the bedridden grandfather. Prominent actors Raghuvaran and Manivannan were selected for supporting roles in the film while Hindi actors Dino Morea and Pooja Batra appeared in small character roles, with Batra playing an actor. Cameraman Arvind Krishna appeared in a small role as Ajith Kumar's friend.\n\nRajiv Menon and Dhanu retained several of the technical team from his previous venture, adding Sujatha as a writer. Menon said he often thought of dialogue in Malayalam—his native language—before telling writer Sujatha to translate it into Tamil. A cinematographer himself, Menon chose to avoid that task in the project and appointed Ravi K. Chandran as the cinematographer. According to Menon, directing and filming at the same time was \"strenuous\", though he said he phtographed almost thirty percent of \"Kandukondain Kandukondain\" because Chandran was briefly unavailable. Music of the film's music was composed by A. R. Rahman while lyrics were written by Vairamuthu; the pair argued during the production. Suresh Urs edited the film while Vikram Dharma directed stunts, Nagu directed arts and Rekha Prakash, Brindha and Raju Sundaram choreographed the songs. Costumes were designed by Nalini Sriram.\n\nScenes with Mammootty's soldier character were filmed in Munnar from February to April 1999, just before the outbreak of the Kargil War. The team were able to borrow a former military helicopter for the sequences. A large portion of the film's first half was filmed in the Kanadugathan area of Karaikudi. The team persuaded industrialist M. A. M. Ramaswamy to lend them his palatial Chettiar mansion for filming; they secured permission to use the property because the producer Thanu was an acquaintance of Ramaswamy. Menon submitted a one-page synopsis of the film to Ramaswamy, who gave his permission under the condition that a death scene was filmed elsewhere. Menon hired the Rao Bahadur house for the extra scenes. According to Menon, during filming in the Chettiar mansion, the unit bonded with Rai and Tabu, becoming good friends; Ajith Kumar learnt from Mammootty and the whole unit ate dinner together. Most of the project's first half was filmed within a week.\n\nIn May 1999, the crew along with Rai and Abbas went to Scotland to film the title song in Dornie with Eilean Donan Castle as a backdrop. Menon used the location to show Rai's character Meenakshi is living in a fantasy world so he filmed the song with a blue and green theme. In comparison, the team wanted to contrast the colours for Tabu's song by using red and brown as the main colours. The production team subsequently planned a four-day trip to Egypt to film a song with the Giza pyramids as a backdrop; however, the trip turned into a week-long schedule. Rajiv Menon and actors Ajith Kumar, Tabu, Raju Sundaram and Ravi K. Chandran travelled daily for three hours from Cairo to film in the heat; one filming day was cancelled after Tabu fainted. Professional Kathakali artists were used for the song \"Konjum Mainakale\", and the video for \"Yengay Yenedhu Kavidhai\" was filmed against the backdrop of Chennai's monsoonal rains. Meanwhile, the song \"Kannamoochi Yenada\" was filmed with the leading cast at Kushaldas Gardens in Chennai. Some scenes featuring Rai were filmed at Menon's flat in Chennai.\n\n\"Kandukondain Kandukondain\" was delayed for six months due to the success of Rai's films \"Taal\" and \"Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam\", which prompted the revival of other projects she had signed up to in that period. Menon's insistence composer A. R. Rahman reworked some of the music to provide a better fusion of classical and contemporary music also delayed progress. Filming ended six months behind the schedule devised by Menon but according to him, everything happened as planned.\n\nDuring post-production, Mammootty initially resisted the dubbing for his character before accepting the producer's demands. The film's producer Kalaipuli S. Thanu had not paid Rajiv Menon for Mammootty's 's work in the film. Thanu's name was subsequently removed from the theatrical release posters in Mumbai and was not included in the crew credits when Menon released a book adaptation of the film.\n\nThe songs in \"Kandukondain Kandukondain\" were composed by A. R. Rahman and the rights to the soundtrack album were bought by Saregama for a then-record sum of 2.2 crore. The soundtrack includes eight songs, one of which is based on a poem written by Subramania Bharati, \n\n\"Kannamoochi\" is set in the Carnatic raga Nattakurinji. Rajiv Menon, who is a fan of this raga, presented Rahman with old recordings of it and asked him to compose at least one piece based on the raga. \"Kandukondain Kandukondain\" is based on the Nalinakanthi raga, \"Smayiyai\" is based on jazz music, and \"Enna Solla Pogirai\" is a folksy and romantic song.\n\nA function was held to mark the release of the soundtrack to \"Kandukondain Kandukondain\" with Kamal Haasan in attendance. The film was initially scheduled for release in the 1999 Diwali season but delays led to the producers announcing it would be released on 1 January 2000, becoming the first film of the new millennium. Further delays due to the success of other films \"Padayappa\" and \"Vaali\" ensured the film missed that date. The release of Mani Ratnam's \"Alaipayuthey\" led to the further postponement of the release of \"Kandukondain Kandukondain\" to May 2000.\n\n\"Kandukondain Kandukondain\" opened to positive reviews from film critics. \"The Indian Express\" stated; \"A progressive film encouraging female independence, yet staying a warm family tale in essence, \"Kandukondain Kandukondain\" is the kind of film every intelligent movie-goer ought not to miss. Almost every supporting character pitches in an impressive performance, thus making \"Kandukondain Kandukondain\" a wonderful watch\". In the review for Rediff, Shobha Warrier stated although the film has \"too many songs, too little emotion\", it has \"a powerful story with intense and well-developed characters. One of the most poignant scenes in the film is Mammootty's outburst against the system, which forgets war heroes who lay down their lives for a cause.\" The film completed 150 days at the box office in Tamil Nadu. It was also successful in Kerala. It was initially unsuccessful in Kerala because Mammootty was not promoted as one of the lead artists. Menon chose to take the film to North Indian audiences but avoided dubbing it to avoid its script being lost in translation, and submitted a final version with English subtitles. \n\nThe film was later released by Shyam Shroff of Shringar Films in a limited number cinemas in Mumbai and New Delhi, earning positive reviews from critics and performing well at the box office. Shroff said, \"although the film didn't make pots of money ... it created tremendous brand equity\". Shobhaa De said the films \"word of mouth was spectacular\" and the \"reports were consistently good\". \"Outlook\" gave the film a favourable review and wrote, \"This winner of a new-age entertainer is actually a tribute to the 'complete'-ness of the ancient Indian film structure.\"\n\n\"Kandukondain Kandukondain\" was showcased at the Regus London Film Festival in November 2011 and critics from the UK newspaper \"The Guardian\" rated it as one of the top-12 films of the event's 270. Critic Peter Bradshaw said it \"is an entertaining reinvention of the novel\" and that \"the richly complicated plot allows it to be exuberantly transposed to modern-day India\", ranking it alongside Ang Lee's \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" and Cameron Crowe's \"Almost Famous\". Menon continued to show the film across the world, including having screenings at the Washington Film Festival in April 2001, Locarno Film Festival in August 2002 and the Tiburon International Film Festival in March 2004. US-based Kino Films bought the home video rights to the film.\n\n\nThe script of \"Kandukondain Kandukondain\" was translated into English and published as a book by Westland Publishers in October 2000. Sanjay Leela Bhansali discussed the possibility of making a Hindi version of the film with Menon. Irrfan Khan held discussions to reprise the role of Major Bala. The project did not go ahead.\n\n\"Kandukondain Kandukondain\" became an important film in the careers of Kumar and Rai, showcasing both actors' versatility and ensured their successful careers in cinema. In an interview, Ajith Kumar stated how he understood his true self after acting in the film. The film's songs inspired several film titles; \"Enge Enadhu Kavithai\" (2002), \"Kannamoochi Yenada\" (2007) and \"Konjum Mainakkale\" (2012). Another film titled \"Enna Solla Pogirai\" starring Shakthi Vasu and Poorna was developed during 2011 before being abandoned. A poster of \"Kandukondain Kandukondain\" is shown in \"12B\" (2001). The character Anjali in the Telugu film \"Chi La Sow\" (2018) was inspired by Tabu's character in \"Kandukondain Kandukondain\". The film inspired a Zee Tamil television serial with the same name.\n"}

{"id": "2213135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2213135", "title": "Roksan", "text": "Roksan\n\nRoksan is a British manufacturer of high fidelity audio products for domestic use, based in Rayleigh, Essex. It is best known for its influential and innovative design for hi-fi equipment, and in particular its Xerxes platform for playing LP records.\n\nRoksan was formed in 1985 by Tufan Hashemi & Touraj Moghaddam, graduates of the University of London, Imperial College London & Queen Mary College. The company's first product was launched at a\nhi-fi show in London in 1985.\n\nThe name Roksan itself is derived from the name of Roxana, daughter of the Persian King Darius. This closely reflects the Persian heritage and roots of both Hashemi and Moghaddam. Not surprisingly many of Roksan's product names have references to names of cities, places and famous people of Persia (now Iran).\n\nMoghaddam, having then just obtained his PhD at Imperial College, became dissatisfied with the state of the audio arts when he heard his little TV set more musically satisfying than his already high-end Linn/Naim tri-amped audio system, and began experimentation. He deduced that where the existing turntable design failed was that the cartridge must be held still wherever the groove goes, and thus the mean line traced by the groove relative to the body of the cartridge needed to be constant. His ideas led him away from using the sprung sub-chassis as part of the speed-controlling system. Moghaddam built a prototype using a fire door. Hashemi, a friend who had heard the new prototype turntable and wanted one, teamed up to start the company. The Darius loudspeaker design, based on the re-examination of the relationship between and magnitudes of movements of the tweeter and the woofer, was already in prototype. The concept stunned the trade when it was demonstrated at the 1985 hi-fi show where the Xerxes was launched.\n\nIn 1996, the company was acquired by Verity plc, a hi-fi group that owned the Mission, Wharfedale and Quad brands. But when Verity demerged around two years later to concentrate on flat-panel speaker technology, Hashemi and Moghaddam reacquired their company.\n\nAccording to public records, Touraj Moghaddam resigned his directorships of Roksan on 15 July 2011. He remains at Vertere Acoustics, where he focuses his efforts on cables.\n\nIn November 2016, British HiFi manufacturers Monitor Audio acquired Roksan.\n\nThe Xerxes, named after the Persian king who \"went around having a good time\", has been acclaimed by a number of hi-fi reviewers. This belt-drive turntable without a sprung sub-chassis challenged conventional suspension designs for build and sound quality. It succeeded in finding favour with British \"flat-earthers\".\n\nThe design attacked the \"high-ground\" by eschewing the spring isolation, which was then regarded as a major strength. Instead, it addressed the issues of Groove drag and lateral rigidity, the ultimate objective of which was to stabilise the relationship between cartridge stylus and the spinning record groove. Springs were not considered sufficiently rigid in the lateral plane, and permitted too much rotation of the suspended parts relative to the motor.\n\nWhile most other designs relied on inertia (through platter mass) to attenuate the problem, Roksan retained a light platter, but addressed drag by mounting the motor on its own bearing and restricted its long-range movement by a small spring, so that the revolving armature could still drive the system. \"Xerxes\" was named #53 \"Hot Product by \"Stereophile\" in 2002.\n\nIn 1990, Roksan employed John Cornock, an Industrial Design graduate from Manchester Polytechnic, to assist in the development of new product lines. He contributed to the aesthetics of the first Radius record player, DP1 CD transport, ROK amplification, Attessa range and the flagship \"Touraj Moghaddam Signature\" (TMS) turntable, named after the company's chief designer and founder. In 2002, the TMS2 replaced the TMS turntable.\n\nRadius 5 & the Radius 7 are the entry-level turntables, the latter having a high precision and stability speed control built in, designed by Simon Taylor who joined the company in 2013.\n\nRoksan was the first company ever to mechanically isolate the speaker tweeter from the bass unit using springs, in their Darius loudspeaker. This design concept has since been followed by other high end speaker manufacturers.\n\nRoksan now has over 30 different products which include analogue and digital sources, electronics amplification and loudspeakers for audio as well as home cinema.\n\nIn 2009, following a philosophy of building high quality components at an affordable price, Roksan launched the K2 stereo integrated amplifier. At a time when British manufacturers had done away with the phono stage for budget products, the K2 was notable in actually having a 47k ohm input for moving-magnet cartridges. The K3 replaced the K2 in 2012, having an uprated power supply and Bluetooth aptX as standard.\n\n2015 saw the introduction of the blak, a new amplifier with a new 'dual monoblock' design, with XLR inputs, bluetooth and a high performance phono input.\n\n\n\n"}

In front-wheel drive cars a transverse engine is usually used. Trucks often have longitudinal engines with rear-wheel drive. \n\nFor motorcycles, the use of a particular type depends on the drive: in case of a chain or belt drive a transverse engine is usually used, and with shaft drives a longitudinal engine. Longitudinal engines in motorcycles do have one disadvantage: the \"tipping point\" of the crankshaft tilts along the entire motorcycle to a greater or lesser degree when accelerating. This is partly resolved by having other components, such as the generator and the gearbox, rotate in the opposite direction to the crankshaft.\n\nMost larger, \"premium\" vehicles use this engine orientation, both front and rear wheel driven, because powerful engines such as the inline-6 and 90° big-bore V8 are usually too long to fit in a FF transverse engine bay, while most mainstream modern vehicles use front wheel drive along with a transverse engine arrangement.\n\nCars with longitudinal engines usually have a smaller minimum turning circle than those with transverse engines. This is because there is more space to the sides of the engine, allowing deeper wheel arches so the front wheels are able to turn through a greater angle.\n\nHonda and Toyota were also offered cars with longitudinal engines, namely Honda Vigor, Acura/Honda Legend/RL and Toyota Tercel.\n\nThis is a list of typical examples of types of engines which can be placed in motor vehicles:\n"}

A long-time Democratic Party campaign consultant, he was a partner at the party-aligned campaign consulting firm AKPD Message and Media, which he joined in 2000.\n\nPlouffe was an outside senior advisor to Obama since the president's first day in office and was then appointed as a Senior Advisor to the President (inside the White House) in 2011 following the resignation of David Axelrod, who went on to start Obama's reelection campaign. In September 2014, he became the Senior Vice President of Policy and Strategy for Uber.\n\nIn May 2015, he left that role to become a full-time strategic adviser for the company. In January 2017, he joined the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to lead the policy and advocacy efforts of the initiative. In 2019, POLITICO reported he joined the Board of Directors of liberal nonprofit ACRONYM, where he would advise an anti-Trump digital campaign. In early 2019 Acronym launched Shadow, the app that caused the 2020 Iowa Caucuses to be delayed. \n\nPlouffe was born and raised in Wilmington, Delaware, in a working class Roman Catholic family (he is now an Episcopalian), the son of Frances (née Vincent), a stay-at-home mother, and James Everett \"Jim\" Plouffe, a factory worker who later worked in marketing.\n\nPlouffe attended St. Mark's High School. He left the University of Delaware prior to graduating in 1989 to pursue a full-time career in politics, and completed his full undergraduate degree in May 2010.\n\nPlouffe began his political career by working for Senator Tom Harkin's 1990 re-election campaign. He later worked as a state field director for Harkin's unsuccessful 1992 Presidential campaign. In the same year he successfully managed Congressman John Olver's first re-election bid in Massachusetts. In 1994 Plouffe managed Delaware Attorney General Charles M. Oberly's unsuccessful campaign against Senator William V. Roth.\n\nPlouffe was the campaign manager for Obama's successful 2008 presidential campaign. He is credited with the campaign's successful overall strategy in the race (primarily against then-Senator Hillary Clinton) for the Democratic Party presidential nomination, to focus on the first caucus in Iowa and on maximizing the number of pledged delegates, as opposed to focusing on states with primaries and the overall popular vote. He is also credited by \"The New Republic\" for Obama's success in the Iowa caucus and for crafting an overall strategy to prolong the primary past Super Tuesday. \"The Chicago Tribune\" writes, \"Plouffe was the mastermind behind a winning strategy that looked well past Super Tuesday's contests on Feb. 5 and placed value on large \"and\" small states\". Plouffe also maintained discipline over communications, including controlling leaks and releasing information about the campaign on its terms. Averse to publicity himself, Plouffe's control over the internal workings of the campaign avoided the publicly aired squabbles that tend to trouble campaigns.\n\nIn June 2008, when then-Senator Obama clinched the Democratic Party nomination, he thanked Plouffe for being the one \"who never gets any credit, but has built the best political campaign, I think, in the history of the United States\". In May 2008, David Axelrod praised Plouffe, stating he had \"done the most magnificent job of managing a campaign that I've seen in my life of watching presidential politics. To start something like this from scratch and build what we have built was a truly remarkable thing\".\n\nAfter winning the election on November 4, Obama credited Plouffe in his acceptance speech, calling him \"the unsung hero of this campaign, who built the...best political campaign, I think, in the history of the United States of America\".\n\nPlouffe went to work as an outside senior adviser to the Obama administration, in January 2009. His book \"The Audacity to Win: The Inside Story and Lessons of Barack Obama's Historic Victory\", discussing management strategies and tactics that he used in the 2008 campaign, was published on November 3, 2009, and became a \"New York Times\" bestseller.\n\nHe later issued a video challenge for Obama supporters to buy a copy of his book on December 8, 2009 to \"\"Beat Sarah Palin\"\" and her bestselling book for one day.\n\nPlouffe signed with the Washington Speakers Bureau to give paid speeches and plans to engage in non-government consulting work.\n\nIn May 2009, Plouffe delivered the convocation address at Cornell University.\n\nIn January 2011, Plouffe joined the White House as Assistant to the President and Senior Advisor. Plouffe replaced David Axelrod as Senior Advisor when Axelrod returned to Chicago to help run President Obama's 2012 re-election campaign.\n\nIn his role as senior advisor, Plouffe led the crafting of White House strategy and communicating the president's message. He attended the president on his domestic and overseas visits, including the May 2011 state visit to the UK.\n\nAfter a successful reelection and inauguration of President Obama, Plouffe departed the White House in January 2013. During a national news event, on his final day in the White House, Plouffe was singled out by the president saying, “What people don’t always realize, because he doesn’t like to show it, is the reason he does this stuff is because he cares deeply about people. And he cares about justice, and he cares about making sure that everybody gets a shot in life. And, those values have motivated him to do incredible things, and were it not for him, we would not have been as effective a White House and I probably wouldn’t be here.”\n\nAfter leaving the White House in early 2013, Plouffe became a contributor for Bloomberg TV and ABC News.\n\nIn April 2013, Plouffe was inducted into the American Association of Political Consultants Hall of Fame.\n\nIn the summer of 2014, rumors circulated that Plouffe might return to the White House as Chief of Staff. On August 5, 2014, Plouffe denied he planned to return at a Politico Playbook lunch, and White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said he did not expect Chief of Staff Denis McDonough to depart.\n\nOn August 19, 2014, Plouffe was appointed as Senior Vice President of Policy and Strategy at Uber.\n\nIn January 2017, Plouffe was hired by Mark Zuckerberg to lead policy and advocacy at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. He'll lead a bipartisan policy board alongside Ken Mehlman where they'll announce policy members and work to find opportunities to work with the government.\n\nIn September 2019, Plouffe was invited to join the board of directors of ACRONYM, a liberal nonprofit group focused on digital messaging, by the CEO Tara McGowan. He'll advise program work at ACRONYM as well as bolster the organization’s fundraising efforts.\n\nPlouffe hosts a podcast, \"Campaign HQ with David Plouffe\", which is a partnership with Cadence13.\n\nPlouffe has drawn criticism for his paid speaking engagements abroad while on hiatus from advising Obama. In early 2009, Plouffe spoke in Baku, Azerbaijan, for $50,000. The event's sponsor had ties to Azerbaijan's authoritarian government. Following complaints from human rights groups, Plouffe donated his speaking fees to the National Democratic Institute.\n\nIn December 2010, Plouffe received $100,000 for two speeches in Nigeria from an affiliate of the South African telecommunications company MTN Group. At the time, MTN had been doing business with the government of Iran since 2005. MTN later came under increased scrutiny by the United States due to allegations that the Iranian government used the MTN network to track and monitor dissidents. MTN has been listed on the \"Iran Business Registry\" of watchdog group United Against Nuclear Iran since 2009. White House spokesman Eric Schultz stated that Plouffe had only spoken to the group about digital communications and cellular technology, and had declined to meet with the company's leadership. Schultz also said the criticism of Plouffe's speeches before he joined the White House was \"misplaced\".\n\nIn 2013, in response to accusations from Congressman Darrell Issa (R-CA) that the Obama administration knew about the IRS targeting of not-for-profit conservative groups for extra scrutiny, Plouffe tweeted: \"Strong words from Mr Grand Theft Auto and suspected arsonist/insurance swindler. And loose ethically today\", referring to two incidents in Issa's past. In 1972, while a teenager, Issa was accused of stealing a Maserati sports car; the charges were later dropped. In 1982, a Cleveland warehouse belonging to Issa burned to the ground. The fire was ruled suspicious and Issa collected an insurance payout, but he was not charged with any crime. \nIn February 2017, Plouffe was fined $90,000 by the Chicago Board of Ethics for the violation of ethics rules when he failed to register as a lobbyist after contacting Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel to help Uber with regulations for picking up travelers at Chicago airports. The board also fined Uber $2,000 for hiring a lobbyist who violated the city's lobbying laws.\n\n\nPlouffe appeared on \"Race for the White House\" in the episode about the 1948 United States presidential election.\n\nPlouffe is married to Olivia Morgan, a senior advisor to Maria Shriver’s A Woman's Nation, a member of Obama's President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities, and Director of Federal Relations to former California Governor Gray Davis. The couple resides in San Francisco, and have two children.\n\n\n"}

Settat is located 83.9 km by road south of the centre of Casablanca, roughly an hour's drive. It is the capital of Settat Province and is its largest city in both size and population. According to the 2014 Moroccan census, it had a population of 142,250 people, up from 116,570 people in the 2004 census. Settat is 370m above sea level, built on a plateau surrounded by foothills in all directions. The antiquities of Settat include the very old Ismailiya Kasbah distinguished by the statue of a steed which lies at the center of the city.\n\nThe name Settat comes from \"Ait Settat\" a Senhaja-Berber (AMAZIGH) clan of the Houara tribe. They belonged to the Masmuda-led Almohad alliance according to al-Baydaq, Ibn Hazm and Ibn Khaldun. Their origin is south-east of the High-Atlas and they seemingly settled in the Chaouia region as a result of the Almohad advance to the north.\n\nBy choosing to build the Kasbah on the hilly site of Settat, 18th century Moroccan ruler Moulay Ismail would trigger the process of urbanization. Indeed, the building of the Kasbah brought order and security for travelers and residents supported the settlements near it. Moreover, by installing the first Caïd in the region which previously depended Caïd Doukkali and Rahmani, Moulay Ismail formalized Settat status as capital of this region.\n\nSettat became an administrative center in the early 18th century, due to its strategic position as an unavoidable passage between North and South. Thanks to the richness of the soil, it also prospered during the 18th and 19th centuries as an important trading center for agricultural products, attracting entrepreneurs. This was the case for Moroccan Jews who settled here en masse in the 19th century, building their own neighborhood, the Mellah, near the Kasbah.\n\nThis development was disrupted in the early 20th century during the early chaos of the French colonization when the Chaouia tribes rallied to Moulay Hafid. However, under the French protectorate, the city of Settat had unprecedented urban development, as evidenced by the population boom it experienced from 1913 to 1925. This prosperity lasted until the early fifties when, as a result of the development of Casablanca, communications, and transportation, the city of Settat and other towns in the region have entered a period of semi-lethargy.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Settat was endowed with a university L’Université Hassan 1er de Settat, an international golf course, and a racetrack. Settat has undergone large-scale urban planning from the 1970s to become an important regional center. Settat is linked to Casablanca (57 km to the north) since 2001 by the A7 highway, and Marrakech (146 km to the south) since 2007.\n\n0.Ben Ahmed\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2213172", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2213172", "title": "Minimally conscious state", "text": "Minimally conscious state\n\nA minimally conscious state (MCS) is a disorder of consciousness distinct from persistent vegetative state and locked-in syndrome. Unlike persistent vegetative state, patients with MCS have partial preservation of conscious awareness. MCS is a relatively new category of disorders of consciousness. The natural history and longer term outcome of MCS have not yet been thoroughly studied. The prevalence of MCS was estimated to be 112,000 to 280,000 adult and pediatric cases.\n\nBecause minimally conscious state is a relatively new criterion for diagnosis, there are very few functional imaging studies of patients with this condition. Preliminary data has shown that overall cerebral metabolism is less than in those with conscious awareness (20-40% of normal) and is slightly higher but comparable to those in vegetative states. Activation in the medial parietal cortex and adjacent posterior cingulate cortex are brain regions that seem to differ between patients in MCS and those from vegetative states. These areas are most active during periods of conscious waking and are least active when in altered states of consciousness, such as general anesthesia, propofol, hypnotic state, dementia, and Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome. Auditory stimulation induced more widespread activation in the primary and pre-frontal associative areas of MCS patients than vegetative state patients. There were also more cortiocortical functional connectivity between the auditory cortex and a large network of temporal and prefrontal cortices in MCS than vegetative states. These findings encourage treatments based on neuromodulatory and cognitive revalidation therapeutic strategies for patients with MCS.\n\nOne study used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in two case studies. They found that there were widespread cerebral atrophy in both patients. The lateral ventricles were increased in size, and the corpus callosum and the periventricular white matter were diminished. The DTI maps showed that there was significant reduction of volume in the medial corpus callosum and other parts of the brain compared to normal subjects. They also found markedly lower diffusion values in white matter and increased cerebral spinal fluid compartments. Cortical injuries at this level provides a particular favorable environment for sprouting of new axons to occur in the intact areas of the cortex, which may explain some of the greater recovery rates in minimally conscious state patients. The axonal regrowth has been correlated with functional motor recovery. The regrowth and rerouting of the axons may explain some of the changes to brain structure. These findings support the efforts to prospectively and longitudinally characterize neuroplasticity in both brain structure and function following severe injuries. Utilizing DTI and other neuroimaging techniques may further shed light on the debates on long-distance cortical rewiring and may lead to better rehabilitation strategies.\n\nSome areas of the brain that are correlated with the subjective experience of pain were activated in MCS patients when noxious stimulation was present. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans found increased blood flow to the secondary sensory cortex, posterior parietal cortex, premotor cortex, and the superior temporal cortex. The pattern of activation, however, was with less spatial extent. Some parts of the brain were less activated than normal patients during noxious stimulus processing. These were the posterior cingulate, medial prefrontal cortex, and the occipital cortex. Even though functional brain imaging can objectively measure changes in brain function during noxious stimulation, the role of different areas of the brain in pain processing is only partially understood. Furthermore, there is still the problem of the subjective experience. MCS patients by definition cannot consistently and reliably communicate their experiences. Even if they were able to answer the question \"are you in pain?\", there would not be a reliable response. Further clinical trials are needed to access the appropriateness of the use of analgesia in patients with MCS.\n\nA functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study found that minimally conscious state patients showed activation in auditory networks when they heard narratives that had personally meaningful content that were read forwards by a familiar voice. These activations were not seen when the narratives were read backwards.\n\nAnother study compared patients in vegetative state and minimally conscious state in their ability to recognize language. They found that some patients in minimally conscious state demonstrated some evidence of preserved speech processing. There was more activation in response to sentences compared to white noise.\n\nMinimally conscious state (MCS) is defined as a condition of severely altered consciousness in which minimal but definite behavioral evidence of self or environmental awareness is demonstrated.\n\nAlthough MCS patients are able to demonstrate cognitively mediated behaviors, they occur inconsistently. They are, however, reproducible or can be sustained long enough to be differentiated from reflexive behavior. Because of this inconsistency, extended assessment may be required to determine if a simple response (e.g. a finger movement or a blink) occurred because of a specific environmental event (e.g. a command to move the finger or to blink) or was merely a coincidental behavior. Distinguishing between VS and MCS is often difficult because the diagnosis is dependent on observation of behavior that show self or environmental awareness and because those behavioral responses are markedly reduced. One of the more common diagnostic errors involving disorders of consciousness is mistaking MCS for VS which may lead to serious repercussions related to clinical management.\n\nGiacino et al. have suggested demonstration of the following behaviors in order to make the diagnosis of MCS.\n\n\nThere is currently no definitive evidence that support altering the course of the recovery of minimally conscious state. There are currently multiple clinical trials underway investigating potential treatments.\nIn one case study, stimulation of thalamus using deep brain stimulation (DBS) led to some behavioral improvements. The patient was a 38-year-old male who had remained in minimally conscious state following a severe traumatic brain injury. He had been unresponsive to consistent command following or communication ability and had remained non-verbal over two years in inpatient rehabilitation. fMRI scans showed preservation of a large-scale, bi-hemispheric cerebral language network, which indicates that possibility for further recovery may exist. Positron emission tomography showed that the patient's global cerebral metabolism levels were markedly reduced. He had DBS electrodes implanted bilaterally within his central thalamus. More specifically, the DBS electrodes targeted the anterior intralaminar nuclei of thalamus and adjacent paralaminar regions of thalamic association nuclei. Both electrodes were positioned within the central lateral nucleus, the paralaminar regions of the median dorsalis, and the posterior-medial aspect of the centromedian/parafasicularis nucleus complex. This allowed maximum coverage of the thalamic bodies. A DBS stimulation was conducted such that the patient was exposed to various patterns of stimulation to help identify optimal behavioral responses. Approximately 140 days after the stimulation began, qualitative changes in behavior emerged. There were longer periods of eye opening and increased responses to command stimuli as well as higher scores on the JFK coma recovery scale (CRS). Functional object use and intelligible verbalization was also observed. The observed improvements in arousal level, motor control, and consistency of behavior could be a result of direct activation of frontal cortical and basal ganglia systems that were innervated by neurons within the thalamic association nuclei. These neurons act as a key communication relay and form a pathway between the brainstem arousal systems and frontal lobe regions. This pathway is crucial for many executive functions such as working memory, effort regulation, selective attention, and focus.\n\nIn another case study of a 50-year-old woman who had symptoms consistent with MCS, administration of zolpidem, a sedative hypnotic drug improved the patient's condition significantly. Without treatment, the patient showed signs of mutism, athetoid movements of the extremities, and complete dependence for all personal care. 45 minutes after 5 to 10 mg of zolpidem was administered, the patient ceased the athetoid movements, regained speaking ability, and was able to self-feed. The effect lasted 3–4 hours from which she returned to the former state. The effects were repeated on a daily basis. PET scans showed that after zolpidem was administered, there was a marked increase in blood flow to areas of the brain adjacent to or distant from damaged tissues. In this case, these areas were the ipsilateral cerebral hemispheres and the cerebellum. These areas are thought to have been inhibited by the site of injury through a GABA-mediated mechanism and the inhibition was modified by zolpidem which is a GABA agonist. The fact that zolpidem is a sedative drug that induces sleep in normal people but causes arousal in a MCS patient is paradoxical. The mechanisms to why this effect occurs is not entirely clear.\n\nThere is recent evidence that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a technique that supplies a small electric current in the brain with non-invasive electrodes, may improve the clinical state of patients with MCS. In one study with 10 patients with disorders of consciousness (7 in VS, 3 in MCS), tDCS was applied for 20 minutes every day for 10 days, and showed clinical improvement in all 3 patients who were in MCS, but not in those with VS. These results remained at 12-month follow-up. Two of the patients in MCS that had their brain insult less that 12 months recovered consciousness in the following months. One of these patients received a second round of tDCS treatment 4 months after his initial treatment, and showed further recovery and emerged into consciousness, with no change of clinical status between the two treatments. Moreover, in a sham-controlled, double-blind crossover study, the immediate effects of a single session of tDCS were shown to transiently improve the clinical status of 13 out of 30 patients with MCS, but not in those with VS\nOne of the defining characteristics of minimally conscious state is the more continuous improvement and significantly more favorable outcomes post injury when compared with vegetative state. One study looked at 100 patients with severe brain injury. At the beginning of the study, all the patients were unable to follow commands consistently or communicate reliably. These patients were diagnosed with either MCS or vegetative state based on performance on the JFK Coma Recovery Scale and the diagnostic criteria for MCS as recommended by the Aspen Consensus Conference Work-group. Both patient groups were further separated into those that suffered from traumatic brain injury and those that suffered from non-traumatic brain injures (anoxia, tumor, hydrocephalus, infection). The patients were assessed multiple times over a period of 12 months post injury using the Disability Rating Scale (DRS) which ranges from a score of 30=dead to 0=no disabilities. The results show that the DRS scores for the MCS subgroups showed the most improvement and predicted the most favorable outcomes 12 months post injury. Amongst those diagnosed with MCS, DRS scores were significantly lower for those with non-traumatic brain injuries in comparison to the vegetative state patients with traumatic brain injury. DRS scores were also significantly lower for the MCS non-traumatic brain injury group compared to the MCS traumatic brain injury group. Pairwise comparisons showed that DRS scores were significantly higher for those that suffered from non-traumatic brain injuries than those with traumatic brain injuries. For the patients in vegetative states there were no significant differences between patients with non-traumatic brain injury and those with traumatic brain injuries. Out of the 100 patients studied, 3 patients fully recovered (had a DRS score of 0). These 3 patients were diagnosed with MCS and had suffered from traumatic brain injuries.\n\nIn summary, those with minimally conscious state and non-traumatic brain injuries will not progress as well as those with traumatic brain injuries while those in vegetative states have an all around lower to minimal chance of recovery.\n\nBecause of the major differences in prognosis described in this study, this makes it crucial that MCS be diagnosed correctly. Incorrectly diagnosing MCS as vegetative state may lead to serious repercussions related to clinical management.\n\nPrior to the mid-1990s, there was a lack of operational definitions available to clinicians and researchers to guide the differential diagnosis among disorders of consciousness. As a result, patients were lumped together into broad categories often based on the severity of the disability (e.g. moderate, severe, extremely severe). These diagnoses were performed without regard to salient differences in behavioral and pathological characteristics. In a three-year period spanning from 1994–1996, three position statements regarding the diagnostic criteria of disorder of consciousness were published. The “Medical Aspects of the Persistent Vegetative State” was published by\nthe American Academy of Neurology (AAN) in 1994. In 1995, “Recommendations for Use of Uniform Nomenclature Pertinent to Patients With Severe Alterations in Consciousness” was published by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine (ACRM). In 1996 the “International Working Party on the Management of the Vegetative State: Summary Report” was published by a group of international delegates from neurology, rehabilitation, neurosurgery, and neuropsychology. However, because the diagnostic criteria were published independently from one another, the final recommendations differed greatly from one another. The Aspen Neurobehavioral Work-group was convened to explore the underlying causes of these disparities. In the end, the Aspen Work-group provided a consensus statement regarding definitions and diagnostic criteria disorder of consciousness which include the vegetative state (VS) and the minimally conscious state (MCS).\n\nOne of the major ethical concerns involving patients with severe brain damage is their inability to communicate. By definition, patients who are unconscious or are minimally conscious are incapable of giving informed consent which is required for participation in clinical research. Typically, written approval is obtained from family members or legal representatives. The inability to receive informed consent has led to much research being refused grants, ethics committee approval, or research publication. This puts patients in these conditions at risk of being denied therapy that may be life-saving.\n\nThe right to die in patients with severe cognitive impairment has developed over time because of their grave neurological state and the perceived futility of continued treatment. Such cases have been debated vigorously in the past, as in the case with Terri Schiavo who was diagnosed with persistent vegetative state. In the case of minimally conscious state patients, they are neither permanently unconscious nor are they necessarily hopelessly damaged. Thus, these patients warrant additional evaluation. On one hand, some argue that entertaining the possibility of intervention in some patients may erode the \"right to die\" moral obligation. Conversely, there is also fear that people may associate attitudes with higher-functioning people in minimally conscious state with people in persistent vegetative state, thus minimizing the value of their lives.\n\nCurrently, risk aversion dominates the ethical landscape when research involves those with impaired decision-making abilities. Fears of therapeutic adventurism has led to a disproportionate view about the under-appreciation of potential benefits and an overstatement of risks. Thus, recognizing this distortion is important in order to calculate the right balance between protecting vulnerable populations that cannot provide autonomous consent and potentially restorative clinical trials.\n"}
{"id": "2213177", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2213177", "title": "Carmyle", "text": "Carmyle\n\nCarmyle () is a suburb in the east end of Glasgow, Scotland, directly north of the River Clyde. It is in an isolated location separated from the main urban area of the city and has the characteristics of a semi-rural village. Administratively, Carmyle falls under the Shettleston ward of Glasgow City Council.\n\nCarmyle as a place name, originally appears as a gift of the lands by Herbert, the Bishop of Glasgow (1147–1164) to the Cistercian Abbey of Neubotle\n(Newbattle, in Midlothian). This abbey had been established a few years previously by David I, whose mother, the saintly Margaret, Queen of Scotland and wife of king Malcolm III Ceanmore, had done so much to sow the seeds of Christianity in early Scotland.\n\nThe name Carmyle is derived from Gaelic and translates as \"the bare cairn\". The reason for this may not be too difficult to find. Originally, most of the land north of Carmyle and Tollcross was forest and brushwood, giving excellent cover for wild animals, but the strips of land alongside the river banks were very rich for cultivating. Therefore, the lands in and around Carmyle were probably cleared at an early date, so as to give room for successful agriculture. \"Bare town\" would be quite appropriate in the circumstances. The village has within it a residence of the Verona Fathers, in the property once known as Carmyle House.\n\nFollowing on its becoming an attribute of the church through Bishop Herbert, the district was confirmed to the monks from time to time by succeeding kings and popes. A note appended to the transcript of a papal bull, dated 1263, shows that the monks had ceased to be owners, for the time being. How the change occurred is explained in a charter granted by John Cheyam, Bishop of Glasgow, on 11 June 1268. It appears that the bishop had, with his own money and with the help of Sir Reginald of Irewyn, Archdeacon of Glasgow, purchased, or redeemed, the land of Kermil. Being zealous for the increase of divine service in Glasgow Cathedral, he dedicated the property (except the new mill which he had erected on the water of the Clyde) for sustenance of three chaplains or priests, to celebrate divine service in the Cathedral for the souls of the predecessors and successors of Archdeacon Reginald. Bishop John's pious arrangement, however, seems to have been disregarded by Robert Wishart, the succeeding bishop. His interference led the dean and chapter to appeal to the Pope in 1275, for redress. The bishops of Dunblane and Argyle were commanded by the Pope to investigate the matter, but the final outcome was never documented.\n\nThe district and village were known by various names, including Carmyld, Karmyle, Kermil, Neddyr Carmyle, Overe Carmyle and Wester Carmyled. The name Hutchesoune was applied to the district called Nether Carmyle, having been added in or about the year 1579, to the lands now owned by Thomas Hutcheson. His two sons were the founders of the hospital and school in Glasgow, bearing their name.\n\nDue to its physical isolation from the main built-up areas of Glasgow, Carmyle has something of a rural village character as opposed to a neighbourhood in a city. The River Clyde runs directly to the south, opposite the Westburn neighbourhood of Cambuslang (South Lanarkshire) – the banks were previously connected for pedestrians by the Westburn Viaduct, a disused rail bridge, but that has now been blocked off. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service National Training Centre (2013) and Clydesmill Community Fire Station (2011) are also on the southern bank of the river, on the site of the large Clydesmill Power Station which was present for most of the 20th century. \n\nTo the north, the closest parts of Glasgow (on the other side of railway lines and the M74 motorway) are Auchenshuggle, Foxley and Mount Vernon. There is a large industrial estate to the west of Carmyle (built on the site of the Clyde Iron Works, in operation from the late 18th to late 20th century).\n\nLand to the east at Kenmuir is undeveloped, some being abandoned farmland and coal workings; the farm was known for its unconventional owner during the latter 20th century who had the farmhouse extended, but it was abandoned to become ruined a few yards south of the motorway after the owner lost a court case in relation to its construction. In the 2010s, plans were outlined for much of this land to be developed for housing as a 'Community Growth Area'.\n\nCarmyle railway station which opened in August 1866, closed in 1964 but then re-opened again in 1993, is on the Whifflet Line. It is an unstaffed, 2-platform halt. Trains run to Glasgow Central and from Westbound Platform 1, and to , , , and from Eastbound Platform 2. The service is operated by Abellio ScotRail.\n\nThe village also has bus services to Glasgow city centre, The Forge Shopping Centre (Parkhead) and Cambuslang, although these are not among the main routes in the region.\n\nThe village is also close to the M74 motorway giving easy access to Scotland's central belt, the Scottish Borders and beyond. Construction on the extension project] extending the M74 from Carmyle to Glasgow City Centre began in May 2008 and was completed in 2011.\n\nThe current Carmyle Church of Scotland situated in Carmyle Avenue was built in 1907, costing an estimated £2,500. The style is Scottish baronial revival, mainly in imitation rubble work, with a machicolated belltower featuring the eccentricity of an onion dome for a belfry (actually a \"helmet dome\"). The Church was formally opened with a dedication service held on Thursday 7 March 1907, and performed by the Rev. Alex White, D.D., of St Georges, Edinburgh. As well as weekly services the church is used by the local community for Brownies, Mother and Toddler groups and a regular thrift shop. Carmyle Church is a linked charge with Kenmuir Mount Vernon Church of Scotland on London Road, with the one minister serving both congregations. Both Carmyle and Kenmuir are also linked via a parish grouping with Sandyhills Church of Scotland. Services are held at Carmyle Church every Sunday at 12:00pm.\n\nLike so many other areas in the west of Scotland, the Reformation and foundation of the Protestant Reformed Kirk saw the almost complete removal of the Catholic faith from Carmyle and the land transferred into secular hands. It was not until 1829 and the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 that punitive laws against Catholicism were relaxed and the old Church begin to re-establish itself in Scotland. There had been an influx of Catholics from the Highlands as well as from Ireland during the progress of the Industrial Revolution and this was reflected in the growing population of Carmyle. However, it was not until the mid-20th century that numbers increased to the extent that the area warranted provision independent of St Joseph’s Tollcross parish, of which it had until then formed a part.\n\nFrom March 1954, the priests of St Joseph's used the local Welfare Hall to provide services to the Catholics of Carmyle, with the parish being established under the patronage of St. Joachim in July.\n\nCarmyle Mains Steading farm on River Road was obtained and from a state of dereliction was transformed into a Chapel Hall over a 10-month period to June 1955 by the local folk. Progress continued apace and a new church (designed by Coia) was built on an elevated piece of land at the end of Inzievar Terrace, opening in September, 1957 – the present St Joachim’s. The parish is located within the Glasgow Archdiocese, although the village itself was not incorporated into the city until 1975 with the revision of local government boundaries.\n\nCarmyle Primary School achieved small notoriety in the mid-1970s when it was rebuilt in a flying saucer/open plan design, a rarity in Scotland at the time. The school was subsequently rebuilt as a modern open-plan building after its demolition in 1993 following a fire.\n\nSt Joachim's Primary School is affiliated with the Catholic Church of the same name. St Joachim’s, in its current guise, was built in 1975.\n\nCarmyle has one public houses and two bowling greens. The Auld Boat Hoose, or \"bottom shop\" in River Road, opposite the spot where a boat would ferry people across the Clyde from the Cambuslang side, and the former Auld Hoose, or \"tap shop\", round the corner, a few hundred yards up Carmyle Avenue.\n\nCarmyle Bowling Club is situated one hundred yards from the \"bottom shop\" and has been a member of the Glasgow and Scottish Bowling Associations since the 1960s. Foxley Bowling Club in Carmyle Avenue was instituted in 1914,taking its name from the local estate called Foxley. Several residents of Carmyle are members and a friendly rivalry exists between the two clubs.\n\nWalter Smith, although born in Lanark, grew up in the Gardenside area of Carmyle. He went on to become one of the most successful managers in the history of Rangers F.C. across two spells in charge, and also managed the Scotland national football team.\n\nBuilt in 1976, the Clydeford Bridge carries vehicles and pedestrians over the Clyde on the A763 road towards an industrial suburb on the site of the Clyde Iron Works, and towards the M74 motorway and A74 road. The bridge is located to the north-east of Cambuslang and the south-west of Carmyle. Its name derives from Clydeford Road which runs north from Cambuslang Main Street to the river, which was itself named after an ancient ford across the water at a nearby point. It was built to replace the Cambuslang Bridge (built 1892) located to the west - that bridge has never been demolished although it is closed to traffic.\n\nOn the south side of the Clydeford bridge at the Clyde Walkway and National Cycle Route 75 is a metallic wire sculpture of a wading bird created in 1998 by noted sculptor Andy Scott. It is known as the Carmyle Heron (although it is actually on the Cambuslang side of the river).\n\n"}

He was a renowned scholar of Yiddish. In 1929 he settled in Vilnius where he became an early director of YIVO.\n\nHe was incarcerated in the Vilna Ghetto where he became an observant Jew. During his time in the ghetto, Kalmanovich kept a secret diary which is one of the few primary sources recording day-to-day life. His diary stressed the efforts of the community to retain their humanity in the face of oppression. For example, on October 11, 1942, he wrote the following entry in his diary: On Simhat Torah eve at the invitation of the rabbi, I went for services in a house that had formerly been a synagogue and was now a music school ... I said a few words: 'Our song and dance are a form of worship. Our rejoicing is due to Him who decrees life and death. Here in the midst of this small congregation, in the poor and ruined synagogue, we are united with the whole house of Israel, not only with those who are here today ... And you in your rejoicing, atone for the sins of a generation that is perishing. I know that the Jewish people will live ... And every day the Holy One, blessed be He, in His mercy gives us a gift which we accept with joy and give thanks to His holy name.\n\nDuring the Nazi occupation, he was forced to work at the YIVO offices under Nazi supervision, sorting through the pillaged contents of Vilna's libraries and preparing selected volumes for shipment to Germany. He was sent to the Vaivara concentration camp in Estonia, where he died in 1944.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2213191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2213191", "title": "Church architecture", "text": "Church architecture\n\nChurch architecture refers to the architecture of buildings of Christian churches. It has evolved over the two thousand years of the Christian religion, partly by innovation and partly by imitating other architectural styles as well as responding to changing beliefs, practices and local traditions. From the birth of Christianity to the present, the most significant objects of transformation for Christian architecture and design were the great churches of Byzantium, the Romanesque abbey churches, Gothic cathedrals and Renaissance basilicas with its emphasis on harmony. These large, often ornate and architecturally prestigious buildings were dominant features of the towns and countryside in which they stood. However, far more numerous were the parish churches in Christendom, the focus of Christian devotion in every town and village. While a few are counted as sublime works of architecture to equal the great cathedrals and churches, the majority developed along simpler lines, showing great regional diversity and often demonstrating local vernacular technology and decoration.\n\nBuildings were at first from those originally intended for other purposes but, with the rise of distinctively ecclesiastical architecture, church buildings came to influence secular ones which have often imitated religious architecture. In the 20th century, the use of new materials, such as steel and concrete, has had an effect upon the design of churches. The history of church architecture divides itself into periods, and into countries or regions and by religious affiliation. The matter is complicated by the fact that buildings put up for one purpose may have been re-used for another, that new building techniques may permit changes in style and size, that changes in liturgical practice may result in the alteration of existing buildings and that a building built by one religious group may be used by a successor group with different purposes.\n\nThe simplest church building comprises a single meeting space, built of locally available material and using the same skills of construction as the local domestic buildings. Such churches are generally rectangular, but in African countries where circular dwellings are the norm, vernacular churches may be circular as well. A simple church may be built of mud brick, wattle and daub, split logs or rubble. It may be roofed with thatch, shingles, corrugated iron or banana leaves. However, church congregations, from the 4th century onwards, have sought to construct church buildings that were both permanent and aesthetically pleasing. This had led to a tradition in which congregations and local leaders have invested time, money and personal prestige into the building and decoration of churches.\n\nWithin any parish, the local church is often the oldest building and is larger than any pre-19th-century structure except perhaps a barn. The church is often built of the most durable material available, often dressed stone or brick. The requirements of liturgy have generally demanded that the church should extend beyond a single meeting room to two main spaces, one for the congregation and one in which the priest performs the rituals of the Mass. To the two-room structure is often added aisles, a tower, chapels, and vestries and sometimes transepts and mortuary chapels. The additional chambers may be part of the original plan, but in the case of a great many old churches, the building has been extended piecemeal, its various parts testifying to its long architectural history.\n\n \n\nIn the first three centuries of the Early Livia Christian Church, the practice of Christianity was illegal and few churches were constructed. In the beginning, Christians worshipped along with Jews in synagogues and in private houses. After the separation of Jews and Christians, the latter continued to worship in people's houses, known as house churches. These were often the homes of the wealthier members of the faith. Saint Paul, in his first letter to the Corinthians writes: \"The churches of Asia send greetings. Aquila and Prisca, together with the church in their house, greet you warmly in the Lord.\"\n\nSome domestic buildings were adapted to function as churches. One of the earliest of adapted residences is at Dura Europos church, built shortly after 200 AD, where two rooms were made into one, by removing a wall, and a dais was set up. To the right of the entrance a small room was made into a baptistry.\n\nSome church buildings were specifically built as church assemblies, such as that opposite the emperor Diocletian's palace in Nicomedia. Its destruction was recorded thus:\nWhen that day dawned, in the eighth consulship of Diocletian and seventh of Maximian, suddenly, while it was yet hardly light, the perfect, together with chief commanders, tribunes, and officers of the treasury, came to the church in Nicomedia, and the gates having been forced open, they searched everywhere for an idol of the Divinity. The books of the Holy Scriptures were found, and they were committed to the flames; the utensils and furniture of the church were abandoned to pillage: all was rapine, confusion, tumult. That church, situated on rising ground, was within view of the palace; and Diocletian and Galerius stood as if on a watchtower, disputing long whether it ought to be set on fire. The sentiment of Diocletian prevailed, who dreaded lest, so great a fire being once kindled, some part of the city might he burnt; for there were many and large buildings that surrounded the church. Then the Pretorian Guards came in battle array, with axes and other iron instruments, and having been let loose everywhere, they in a few hours leveled that very lofty edifice with the ground.\n\nFrom the first to the early fourth centuries most Christian communities worshipped in private homes, often secretly. Some Roman churches, such as the Basilica of San Clemente in Rome, are built directly over the houses where early Christians worshipped. Other early Roman churches are built on the sites of Christian martyrdom or at the entrance to catacombs where Christians were buried.\n\nWith the victory of the Roman emperor Constantine at the Battle of Milvian Bridge in 312 AD, Christianity became a lawful and then the privileged religion of the Roman Empire. The faith, already spread around the Mediterranean, now expressed itself in buildings. Christian architecture was made to correspond to civic and imperial forms, and so the Basilica, a large rectangular meeting hall became general in east and west, as the model for churches, with a nave and aisles and sometimes galleries and clerestories. While civic basilicas had apses at either end, the Christian basilica usually had a single apse where the bishop and presbyters sat in a dais behind the altar. While pagan basilicas had as their focus a statue of the emperor, Christian basilicas focused on the Eucharist as the symbol of the eternal, loving and forgiving God.\n\nThe first very large Christian churches, notably Santa Maria Maggiore, San Giovanni in Laterano, and Santa Costanza, were built in Rome in the early 4th century.\n\nThe church building as we know it grew out of a number of features of the Ancient Roman period:\n\nWhen Early Christian communities began to build churches they drew on one particular feature of the houses that preceded them, the \"atrium\", or courtyard with a colonnade surrounding it. Most of these atriums have disappeared. A fine example remains at the Basilica of San Clemente in Rome and another was built in the Romanesque period at Sant'Ambrogio, Milan. The descendants of these \"atria\" may be seen in the large square cloisters that can be found beside many cathedrals, and in the huge colonnaded squares or piazza at the Basilicas of St Peter's in Rome and St Mark's in Venice and the Camposanto (Holy Field) at the Cathedral of Pisa.\n\nEarly church architecture did not draw its form from Roman temples, as the latter did not have large internal spaces where worshipping congregations could meet. It was the Roman basilica, used for meetings, markets and courts of law that provided a model for the large Christian church and that gave its name to the Christian basilica.\n\nBoth Roman basilicas and Roman bath houses had at their core a large vaulted building with a high roof, braced on either side by a series of lower chambers or a wide arcaded passage. An important feature of the Roman basilica was that at either end it had a projecting exedra, or apse, a semicircular space roofed with a half-dome. This was where the magistrates sat to hold court. It passed into the church architecture of the Roman world and was adapted in different ways as a feature of cathedral architecture.\n\nThe earliest large churches, such as the Cathedral of San Giovanni in Laterano in Rome, consisted of a single-ended basilica with one apsidal end and a courtyard, or \"atrium\", at the other end. As Christian liturgy developed, processions became part of the proceedings. The processional door was that which led from the furthest end of the building, while the door most used by the public might be that central to one side of the building, as in a basilica of law. This is the case in many cathedrals and churches.\n\nAs numbers of clergy increased, the small apse which contained the altar, or table upon which the sacramental bread and wine were offered in the rite of Holy Communion, was not sufficient to accommodate them. A raised dais called a\" bema\" formed part of many large basilican churches. In the case of St. Peter's Basilica and San Paolo Fuori le Mura (St Paul's outside the Walls) in Rome, this bema extended laterally beyond the main meeting hall, forming two arms so that the building took on the shape of a T with a projecting apse. From this beginning, the plan of the church developed into the so-called Latin Cross which is the shape of most Western Cathedrals and large churches. The arms of the cross are called the transept.\n\nOne of the influences on church architecture was the mausoleum. The mausoleum of a noble Roman was a square or circular domed structure which housed a sarcophagus. The Emperor Constantine built for his daughter Costanza a mausoleum which has a circular central space surrounded by a lower ambulatory or passageway separated by a colonnade.\nSanta Costanza's burial place became a place of worship as well as a tomb. It is one of the earliest church buildings that was central, rather than longitudinally planned. Constantine was also responsible for the building of the circular, mausoleum-like Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, which in turn influenced the plan of a number of buildings, including that constructed in Rome to house the remains of the proto-martyr Stephen, San Stefano Rotondo and the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna.\n\nAncient circular or polygonal churches are comparatively rare. A small number, such as the Temple Church, London were built during the Crusades in imitation of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre as isolated examples in England, France, and Spain. In Denmark such churches in the Romanesque style are much more numerous. In parts of Eastern Europe, there are also round tower-like churches of the Romanesque period but they are generally vernacular architecture and of small scale. Others, like St Martin's Rotunda at Visegrad, in the Czech Republic, are finely detailed.\n\nThe circular or polygonal form lent itself to those buildings within church complexes that perform a function in which it is desirable for people to stand, or sit around, with a centralized focus, rather than an axial one. In Italy, the circular or polygonal form was used throughout the medieval period for baptisteries, while in England it was adapted for chapter houses. In France, the aisled polygonal plan was adopted as the eastern terminal and in Spain, the same form is often used as a chapel.\n\nOther than Santa Costanza and San Stefano, there was another significant place of worship in Rome that was also circular, the vast Ancient Roman Pantheon, with its numerous statue-filled niches. This too was to become a Christian church and lend its style to the development of Cathedral architecture.\n\nMost cathedrals and great churches have a cruciform groundplan. In churches of Western European tradition, the plan is usually longitudinal, in the form of the so-called Latin Cross, with a long nave crossed by a transept. The transept may be as strongly projecting as at York Minster or not project beyond the aisles as at Amiens Cathedral.\n\nMany of the earliest churches of Byzantium have a longitudinal plan. At Hagia Sophia, Istanbul, there is a central dome, the frame on one axis by two high semi-domes and on the other by low rectangular transept arms, the overall plan being square. This large church was to influence the building of many later churches, even into the 21st century. A square plan in which the nave, chancel and transept arms are of equal length forming a Greek cross, the crossing generally surmounted by a dome became the common form in the Eastern Orthodox Church, with many churches throughout Eastern Europe and Russia being built in this way. Churches of the Greek Cross form often have a narthex or vestibule which stretches across the front of the church. This type of plan was also to later play a part in the development of church architecture in Western Europe, most notably in Bramante's plan for St. Peter's Basilica.\n\nThe division of the Roman Empire in the fourth century AD, resulted in Christian ritual evolving in distinctly different ways in the eastern and western parts of the empire. The final break was the Great Schism of 1054.\n\nEastern Christianity and Western Christianity began to diverge from each other from an early date. Whereas the basilica was the most common form in the west, a more compact centralized style became predominant in the east. These churches were in origin \"martyria\", constructed as mausoleums housing the tombs of the saints who had died during the persecutions which only fully ended with the conversion of Emperor Constantine. An important surviving example is the Mausoleum of Galla Placidia in Ravenna, which has retained its mosaic decorations. Dating from the 5th century, it may have been briefly used as an oratory before it became a mausoleum.\n\nThese buildings copied pagan tombs and were square, cruciform with shallow projecting arms or polygonal. They were roofed by domes which came to symbolize heaven. The projecting arms were sometimes roofed with domes or semi-domes that were lower and abutted the central block of the building. Byzantine churches, although centrally planned around a domed space, generally maintained a definite axis towards the apsidal chancel which generally extended further than the other apses. This projection allowed for the erection of an iconostasis, a screen on which icons are hung and which conceals the altar from the worshippers except at those points in the liturgy when its doors are opened.\n\nThe architecture of Constantinople (Istanbul) in the 6th century produced churches that effectively combined centralized and basilica plans, having semi-domes forming the axis, and arcaded galleries on either side. The church of Hagia Sophia (now a museum) was the most significant example and had an enormous influence on both later Christian and Islamic architecture, such as the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem and the Umayyad Great Mosque in Damascus. Many later Eastern Orthodox churches, particularly large ones, combine a centrally planned, domed eastern end with an aisled nave at the west.\n\nA variant form of the centralized church was developed in Russia and came to prominence in the sixteenth century. Here the dome was replaced by a much thinner and taller hipped or conical roof which perhaps originated from the need to prevent snow from remaining on roofs. One of the finest examples of these tented churches is St. Basil's in Red Square in Moscow.\n\nParticipation in worship, which gave rise to the porch church, began to decline as the church became increasingly clericalized; with the rise of the monasteries church buildings changed as well. The 'two-room' church' became, in Europe, the norm. The first 'room', the nave, was used by the congregation; the second 'room', the sanctuary, was the preserve of the clergy and was where the Mass was celebrated. This could then only be seen from a distance by the congregation through the arch between the rooms (from late mediaeval times closed by a wooden partition, the Rood screen), and the elevation of the host, the bread of the communion, became the focus of the celebration: it was not at that time generally partaken of by the congregation. Given that the liturgy was said in Latin, the people contented themselves with their own private devotions until this point. Because of the difficulty of sight lines, some churches had holes, 'squints', cut strategically in walls and screens, through which the elevation could be seen from the nave. Again, from the twin principles that every priest must say his mass every day and that an altar could only be used once, in religious communities a number of altars were required for which space had to be found, at least within monastic churches.\n\nApart from changes in the liturgy, the other major influence on church architecture was in the use of new materials and the development of new techniques. In northern Europe, early churches were often built of wood, for which reason almost none survive. With the wider use of stone by the Benedictine monks, in the tenth and eleventh centuries, larger structures were erected.\n\nThe two-room church, particularly if it were an abbey or a cathedral, might acquire transepts. These were effectively arms of the cross which now made up the ground plan of the building. The buildings became more clearly symbolic of what they were intended for. Sometimes this crossing, now the central focus of the church, would be surmounted by its own tower, in addition to the west end towers, or instead of them. (Such precarious structures were known to collapse – as at Ely – and had to be rebuilt.) Sanctuaries, now providing for the singing of the offices by monks or canons, grew longer and became chancels, separated from the nave by a screen. Practical function and symbolism were both at work in the process of development.\n\nAcross Europe, the process by which church architecture developed and individual churches were designed and built was different in different regions, and sometimes differed from church to church in the same region and within the same historic period.\n\nAmong the factors that determined how a church was designed and built are the nature of the local community, the location in city, town or village, whether the church was an abbey church, whether the church was a collegiate church, whether the church had the patronage of a bishop, whether the church had the ongoing patronage of a wealthy family and whether the church contained relics of a saint or other holy objects that were likely to draw pilgrimage.\n\nCollegiate churches and abbey churches, even those serving small religious communities, generally demonstrate a greater complexity of form than parochial churches in the same area and of a similar date.\n\nChurches that have been built under the patronage of a bishop have generally employed a competent church architect and demonstrate in the design refinement of style unlike that of the parochial builder.\n\nMany parochial churches have had the patronage of wealthy local families. The degree to which this has an effect on the architecture can differ greatly. It may entail the design and construction of the entire building having been financed and influenced by a particular patron. On the other hand, the evidence of patronage may be apparent only in accretion of chantry chapels, tombs, memorials, fittings, stained glass, and other decorations.\n\nChurches that contain famous relics or objects of veneration and have thus become pilgrimage churches are often very large and have been elevated to the status of basilica. However, many other churches enshrine the bodies or are associated with the lives of particular saints without having attracted continuing pilgrimage and the financial benefit that it brought.\n\nThe popularity of saints, the veneration of their relics, and the size and importance of the church built to honor them are without consistency and can be dependent upon entirely different factors. Two virtually unknown warrior saints, San Giovanni and San Paolo, are honoured by one of the largest churches in Venice, built by the Dominican Friars in competition to the Franciscans who were building the Frari Church at the same time. The much smaller church that contained the body of Saint Lucy, a martyr venerated by Catholics and Protestants across the world and the titular saint of numerous locations, was demolished in the late 19th century to make way for Venice's railway station.\n\nThe first truly baroque façade was built in Rome between 1568 and 1584 for the Church of the Gesù, the mother church of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits). It introduced the baroque style into architecture. Corresponding with the Society's theological task as the spearhead of the Counter-Reformation, the new style soon became a triumphant feature in Catholic church architecture.\n\nAfter the second world war, modern materials and techniques such as concrete and metal panels were introduced in Norwegian church construction. Bodø Cathedral for instance was built in reinforced concrete allowing a wide basilica to be built. During the 1960s there was a more pronounced break from tradition as in the Arctic Cathedral built in lightweight concrete and covered in aluminum sidings.\n\nIn Norway, church architecture has been affected by wood as the preferred material, particularly in sparsely populated areas. Churches built until the second world war are about 90% wooden except medieval constructions. During the Middle Ages all wooden churches in Norway (about 1000 in total) were constructed in the stave church technique, but only 271 masonry constructions. After the Protestant reformation when the construction of new (or replacement of old) churches was resumed, wood was still the dominant material but the log technique became dominant. The log construction gave a lower more sturdy style of building compared to the light and often tall stave churches. Log construction became structurally unstable for long and tall walls, particularly if cut through by tall windows. Adding transepts improved the stability of the log technique and is one reason why the cruciform floor plan was widely used during 1600 and 1700s. For instance the Old Olden Church (1759) replaced a building damaged by hurricane, the 1759 church was then constructed in cruciform shape to make it withstand the strongest winds. The length of trees (logs) also determined the length of walls according to Sæther. In Samnanger church for instance, outside corners have been cut to avoid splicing logs, the result is an octagonal floor plan rather than rectangular. The cruciform constructions provided a more rigid structure and larger churches, but view to the pulpit and altar was obstructed by interior corners for seats in the transept. The octagonal floor plan offers good visibility as well as a rigid structure allowing a relatively wide nave to be constructed - Håkon Christie believes that this is a reason why the octagonal church design became popular during the 1700s. Vreim believes that the introduction of log technique after the reformation resulted in a multitude of church designs in Norway.\n\nIn Ukraine, wood church constructions originate from the introduction of Christianity and continued to be widespread, particularly in rural areas, when masonry churches dominated in cities and in Western Europe.\n\nChurch architecture varies depending on both the sect of the faith, as well as the geographical location and the influences acting upon it. Variances from the typical church architecture as well as unique characteristics can be seen in many areas around the globe.\n\nThe split between Eastern and Western Church Architecture extended its influence into the churches we see in America today as well. America's churches are an amalgamation of the many styles and cultures that collided here, examples being St. Constantine, a Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in Minneapolis, Polish Cathedral style churches, and Russian Orthodox churches, found all across the country. There are remnants of the Byzantine inspired architecture in many of the churches, such as the large domed ceilings, extensive stonework, and a maximizing of space to be used for religious iconography on walls and such. Churches classified as Ukrainian or Catholic also seem to follow the trend of being overall much more elaborately decorated and accentuated than their Protestant counterparts, in which decoration is simple.\n\nSpecifically in Texas, there are remnants of the Anglo-American colonization that are visible in the architecture itself. Texas in itself was a religious hotbed, and so ecclesiastical architecture developed at a faster pace than in other areas. Looking at the Antebellum period, (1835–1861) Church architecture shows the values and personal beliefs of the architects who created them, while also showcasing Texan cultural history. Both the Catholic and Protestant buildings showed things such as the architectural traditions, economic circumstances, religious ordinances, and aesthetic tastes of those involved. The movement to keep ethnicities segregated during this time was also present in the very foundations of this architecture. Their physical appearances vary wildly from area to area though, as each served its own local purpose, and as mentioned before, due to the multitude of religious groups, each held a different set of beliefs.\n\nThe history of England's churches is extensive, their style has gone through many changes and has had numerous influences such as 'geographical, geological, climatic, religious, social and historical, shape it. One of the earliest style changes is shown in the Abbey Church of Westminster, which was built in a foreign style and was a cause for concern for many as it heralded change. A second example is St Paul's Cathedral, which was one of the earliest Protestant Cathedrals in England. There are many other notable churches that have each had their own influence on the ever-changing style in England, such as Truro, Westminster Cathedral, Liverpool and Guildford. Between the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the style of church architecture could be called 'Early English' and 'Decorated'. This time is considered to be when England was in its prime in the category of a church building. It was after the Black Death that the style went through another change, the 'perpendicular style', where ornamentation became more extravagant.\n\nAn architectural element that appeared soon after the Black Death style change and is observed extensively in Medieval English styles is fan vaulting, seen in the Chapel of Henry VII and the King's College Chapel in Cambridge. After this, the prevalent style was Gothic for around 300 years but the style was clearly present for many years before that as well. In these late Gothic times, there was a specific way in which the foundations for the churches were built. First, a stone skeleton would be built, then the spaces between the vertical supports filled with large glass windows, then those windows supported by their own transoms and mullions. On the topic of church windows, the windows are somewhat controversial as some argue that the church should be flooded with light and some argue that they should be dim for an ideal praying environment. Most church plans in England have their roots in one of two styles, Basilican and Celtic and then we see the later emergence of a 'two-cell' plan, consisting of nave and sanctuary.\n\nIn the time before the last war, there was a movement towards a new style of architecture, one that was more functional than embellished. There was an increased use of steel and concrete and a rebellion against the romantic nature of the traditional style. This resulted in a 'battle of the styles' in which one side was leaning towards the modernist, functional way of design, and the other was following traditional Romanesque, Gothic, and Renaissance styles, as reflected in the architecture of all buildings, not just churches.\n\nIn the early Romanian territory of Wallachia, there were three major influences that can be seen. The first are the western influences of Gothic and Romanesque styles, before later falling to the greater influence of the Byzantine styles. The early western influences can be seen in two places, the first is a church in Câmpulung, that showcases distinctly Romanesque styles, and the second are the remnants of a church in Drobeta-Turnu Severin, which has features of the Gothic style. There are not many remaining examples of those two styles, but the Byzantine influence is much more prominent. A few prime examples of the direct Byzantine influence are the St. Nicoara and Domneasca in Curtea de Arges, and church at Nicopolis in Bulgaria. These all show the characteristic features such as sanctuaries, rectangular naves, circular interiors with non-circular exteriors, and small chapels. The Nicopolis church and the Domneasca both have Greek-inspired plans, but the Domneasca is far more developed than the Nicopolis church. Alongside these are also traces of Serbian, Georgian, and Armenian influences that found their way to Wallachia through Serbia.\n\nIn East Asia, Taiwan is one of several countries famous for its church architecture. The Spanish Fort San Domingo in the 17th century had an adjacent church. The Dutch Fort Zeelandia in Tainan also included a chapel. In modern architecture several churches have been inspired to use traditional designs. These include the Church of the Good Shepherd in Shihlin (Taipei), which was designed by Su Hsi Tsung and built in the traditional siheyuan style. The chapel of Taiwan Theological College and Seminary includes a pagoda shape and traditional tile-style roof. Zhongshan and Jinan Presbyterian churches were built during the Japanese era (1895-1945) and reflect a Japanese aesthetic. Tunghai University’s Luce Memorial Chapel, designed by IM Pei’s firm, is often held up as an example of a modern, contextualized style. \n\nGothic-era architecture, originating in 12th-century France, is a style where curves, arches, and complex geometry are highly emphasized. These intricate structures, often of immense size, required great amounts of planning, effort and resources; involved large numbers of engineers and laborers; and often took hundreds of years to complete—all of which was considered a tribute to God.\n\nThe characteristics of a Gothic-style church are largely in congruence with the ideology that the more breathtaking a church is, the better it reflects the majesty of God. This was accomplished through clever math and engineering in a time period where complex shapes, especially in huge cathedrals, were not typically found in structures. Through this newly implemented skill of being able to design complex shapes churches consisted of namely pointed arches, curved lights and windows, and rib vaults. Since these newly popular designs were implemented with respect to the width of the church rather than height, width was much more desired rather than height.\n\nGothic architecture in churches had a heavy emphasis on art. Just like the structure of the building, there was an emphasis on complex geometric shapes. An example of this is stained glass windows, which can still be found in modern churches. Stained glass windows were both artistic and functional in the way that they allowed colored light to enter the church and create a heavenly atmosphere. Other popular art styles in the Gothic era were sculptures. Creating lifelike depictions of figures, again with the use of complex curves and shapes. Artists would include a high level of detail to best preserve and represent their subject.\n\nThe Gothic era, first referred to by historiographer Giorgio Vasari, began in northeastern France and slowly spread throughout Europe. It was perhaps most characteristically expressed in the Rayonnant style, originating in the 13th century, known for its exaggerated geometrical features that made everything as astounding and eye-catching as possible. Gothic churches were often highly decorated, with geometrical features applied to already complex structural forms. By the time the Gothic period neared its close, its influence had spread to residences, guild halls, and public and government buildings.\n\n\nAlthough having its roots in the traditions of Eastern Christianity – especially the Syrian church – as well as later being exposed to European influences – the traditional architectural style of Orthodox Tewahedo (Ethiopian Orthodox-Eritrean Orthodox) churches has followed a path all its own. The earliest known churches show the familiar basilican layout. For example, the church of Debre Damo is organized around a nave of four bays separated by re-used monolithic columns; at the western end is a low-roofed narthex, while on the eastern is the \"maqdas\", or Holy of Holies, separated by the only arch in the building.\n\nThe next period, beginning in the second half of the first millennium AD and lasting into the 16th century, includes both structures built of conventional materials, and those hewn from rock. Although most surviving examples of the first are now found in caves, Thomas Pakenham discovered an example in Wollo, protected inside the circular walls of later construction. An example of these built-up churches would be the church of Yemrehana Krestos, which has many resemblances to the church of Debre Damo both in plan and construction.\n\nThe other style of this period, perhaps the most famous architectural tradition of Ethiopia, are the numerous monolithic churches. This includes houses of worship carved out of the side of mountains, such as Abreha we Atsbeha, which although approximately square the nave and transepts combine to form a cruciform outline – leading experts to categorize Abreha we Atsbeha as an example of cross-in-square churches. Then there are the churches of Lalibela, which were created by excavating into \"a hillside of soft, reddish tuff, variable in hardness and composition\". Some of the churches, such as Bete Ammanuel and the cross-shaped Bete Giyorgis, are entirely free-standing with the volcanic tuff removed from all sides, while other churches, such as Bete Gabriel-Rufael and Bete Abba Libanos, are only detached from the living rock on one or two sides. All of the churches are accessed through a labyrinth of tunnels.\n\nThe final period of Ethiopian church architecture, which extends to the present day, is characterized by round churches with conical roofs – quite similar to the ordinary houses the inhabitants of the Ethiopian highlands live in. Despite this resemblance, the interiors are quite different in how their rooms are laid out, based on a three-part division of:\n\nIn the early 16th century, the Reformation brought a period of radical change to church design. On Christmas Day 1521, Andreas Karlstadt performed the first \"reformed\" communion service. In early January 1522, the Wittenberg city council authorized the removal of imagery from churches and affirmed the changes introduced by Karlstadt on Christmas. According to the ideals of the Protestant Reformation, the spoken word, the sermon, should be central act in the church service. This implied that the pulpit became the focal point of the church interior and that churches should be designed to allow all to hear and see the minister. Pulpits had always been a feature of Western churches. The birth of Protestantism led to extensive changes in the way that Christianity was practiced (and hence the design of churches).\n\nDuring the Reformation period, there was an emphasis on \"full and active participation\". The focus of Protestant churches was on the preaching of the Word, rather than a sacerdotal emphasis. Holy Communion tables became wood to emphasise that Christ's sacrifice was made once for all and were made more immediate to the congregation to emphasise man's direct access to God through Christ. Therefore, catholic churches were redecorated when they became reformed: Paintings and statues of saints were removed and sometimes the altar table was placed in front of the pulpit, as in Strasbourg Cathedral in 1524. The pews were turned towards the pulpit. Wooden galleries were built to allow more worshippers to follow the sermon.\n\nThe first newly built Protestant church was the court chapel of Neuburg Castle in 1543, followed by the court chapel of Hartenfels Castle in Torgau, consecrated by Martin Luther on 5 October 1544.\n\nImages and statues were sometimes removed in disorderly attacks and unofficial mob actions (in the Netherlands called the Beeldenstorm). Medieval churches were stripped of their decorations, such as the Grossmünster in Zürich in 1524, a stance enhanced by the Calvinist reformation, beginning with its main church, St. Pierre Cathedral in Geneva, in 1535. At the Peace of Augsburg of 1555, which ended a period of armed conflict between Roman Catholic and Protestant forces within the Holy Roman Empire, the rulers of the German-speaking states and Charles V, the Habsburg Emperor, agreed to accept the principle \"Cuius regio, eius religio\", meaning that the religion of the ruler was to dictate the religion of those ruled.\n\nIn the Netherlands the Reformed church in Willemstad, North Brabant was built in 1607 as the first Protestant church building in the Netherlands, a domed church with an octagonal shape, according to Calvinism's focus on the sermon. The Westerkerk of Amsterdam was built between 1620 and 1631 in Renaissance style and remains the largest church in the Netherlands that was built for Protestants.\nBy the beginning of the 17th century, in spite of the \"cuius regio\" principle, the majority of the peoples in the Habsburg Monarchy had become Protestant, sparking the Counter-Reformation by the Habsburg emperors which resulted in the Thirty Years' War in 1618. In the Peace of Westphalia treaties of 1648 which ended the war, the Habsburgs were obliged to tolerate three Protestant churches in their province of Silesia, where the counter-reformation had not been completely successful, as in Austria, Bohemia and Hungary, and about half of the population still remained Protestant. However, the government ordered these three churches to be located outside the towns, not to be recognisable as churches, they had to be wooden structures, to look like barns or residential houses, and they were not allowed to have towers or bells. The construction had to be accomplished within a year. Accordingly, the Protestants built their three Churches of Peace, huge enough to give space for more than 5,000 people each. When Protestant troops under Swedish leadership again threatened to invade the Habsburg territories during the Great Northern War, the Habsburgs were forced to allow more Protestant churches within their empire with the Treaty of Altranstädt (1707), however limiting these with similar requirements, the so-called \"Gnadenkirchen\" (Churches of Grace). They were mostly smaller wooden structures.\n\nIn Britain during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, it became usual for Anglican churches to display the Royal Arms inside, either as a painting or as a relief, to symbolise the monarch's role as head of the church.\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries Protestant churches were built in the baroque style that originated in Italy, however consciously more simply decorated. Some could still become fairly grand, for instance the Katarina Church, Stockholm, St. Michael's Church, Hamburg or the Dresden Frauenkirche, built between 1726 and 1743 as a sign of the will of the citizen to remain Protestant after their ruler had converted to Catholicism.\nSome churches were built with a new and genuinely Protestant alignment: the transept became the main church while the nave was omitted, for instance at the Ludwigskirche in Saarbrücken; this building scheme was also quite popular in Switzerland, with the largest being the churches of Wädenswil (1767) and Horgen (1782). A new Protestant interior design scheme was established in many German Lutheran churches during the 18th century, following the example of the court chapel of Wilhelmsburg Castle of 1590: The connection of altar with baptismal font, pulpit and organ in a vertical axis. The central painting above the altar was replaced with the pulpit.\n\nNeo-Lutheranism in the early 19th century criticized this scheme as being too profane. The German Evangelical Church Conference therefore recommended the Gothic language of forms for church building in 1861. Gothic Revival architecture began its triumphal march. With regard to Protestant churches it was not only an expression of historism, but also of a new theological programme which put the Lord's supper above the sermon again. Two decades later liberal Lutherans and Calvinists expressed their wish for a new genuinely Protestant church architecture, conceived on the basis of liturgical requirements. The spaces for altar and worshippers should no longer be separated from each other. Accordingly, churches should not only give space for service, but also for social activities of the parish. Churches were to be seen as meeting houses for the celebrating faithful. The Ringkirche in Wiesbaden was the first church realised according to this ideology in 1892-94. The unity of the parish was expressed by an architecture that united the pulpit and the altar in its circle, following early Calvinist tradition.\n\nThe idea that worship was a corporate activity and that the congregation should be in no way excluded from sight or participation derives from the Liturgical Movement. Simple one-room plans are almost of the essence of modernity in architecture. In France and Germany between the first and second World Wars, some of the major developments took place. The church at Le Raincy near Paris by Auguste Perret is cited as the starting point of process, not only for its plan but also for the materials used, reinforced concrete. More central to the development of the process was Schloss Rothenfels-am-Main in Germany which was remodelled in 1928. Rudolf Schwartz, its architect, was hugely influential on later church building, not only on the continent of Europe but also in the United States of America. Schloss Rothenfels was a large rectangular space, with solid white walls, deep windows and a stone pavement. It had no decoration. The only furniture consisted of a hundred little black cuboid moveable stools. For worship, an altar was set up and the faithful surrounded it on three sides.\n\nCorpus Christi in Aachen was Schwartz's first parish church and adheres to the same principles, very much reminiscent of the Bauhaus movement of art. Externally it is a plan cube; the interior has white walls and colourless windows, a \"langbau\" i.e. a narrow rectangle at the end of which is the altar. It was to be, said Schwartz not 'christocentric' but 'theocentric'. In front of the altar were simple benches. Behind the altar was a great white void of a back wall, signifying the region of the invisible Father. The influence of this simplicity spread to Switzerland with such architects as Fritz Metzger and Dominikus Böhm.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Metzger continued to develop his ideas, notably with the church of St. Franscus at Basel-Richen. Another notable building is Notre Dame du Haut at Ronchamp by Le Corbusier (1954). Similar principles of simplicity and continuity of style throughout can be found in the United States, in particular at the Roman Catholic Abbey church of St. Procopius, in Lisle, near Chicago (1971).\n\nA theological principle which resulted in change was the decree Sacrosanctum Concilium of the Second Vatican Council issued in December 1963. This encouraged 'active participation' (in Latin: \"participatio actuosa\") by the faithful in the celebration of the liturgy by the people and required that new churches should be built with this in mind (para 124) Subsequently, rubrics and instructions encouraged the use of a freestanding altar allowing the priest to face the people. The effect of these changes can be seen in such churches as the Roman Catholic Metropolitan Cathedrals of Liverpool and the Brasília, both circular buildings with a free-standing altar.\n\nDifferent principles and practical pressures produced other changes. Parish churches were inevitably built more modestly. Often shortage of finances, as well as a 'market place' theology suggested the building of multi-purpose churches, in which secular and sacred events might take place in the same space at different times. Again, the emphasis on the unity of the liturgical action, was countered by a return to the idea of movement. Three spaces, one for the baptism, one for the liturgy of the word and one for the celebration of the Eucharist with a congregation standing around an altar, were promoted by Richard Giles in England and the United States. The congregation were to process from one place to another. Such arrangements were less appropriate for large congregations than for small; for the former, proscenium arch arrangements with huge amphitheatres such as at Willow Creek Community Church in Chicago in the United States have been one answer.\n\nAs with other Postmodern movements, the Postmodern movement in architecture formed in reaction to the ideals of modernism as a response to the perceived blandness, hostility, and utopianism of the Modern movement. While rare in designs of church architecture, there are nonetheless some notable examples as architects have begun to recover and renew historical styles and \"cultural memory\" of Christian architecture. Notable practitioners include Dr. Steven Schloeder, Duncan Stroik, and Thomas Gordon Smith.\n\nThe functional and formalized shapes and spaces of the modernist movement are replaced by unapologetically diverse aesthetics: styles collide, form is adopted for its own sake, and new ways of viewing familiar styles and space abound. Perhaps most obviously, architects rediscovered the expressive and symbolic value of architectural elements and forms that had evolved through centuries of building—often maintaining meaning in literature, poetry and art—but which had been abandoned by the modern movement. Church buildings in Nigeria evolved from its foreign monument look of old to the contemporary design which makes it look like a factory.\n\n\n\n"}

It has etymological homonymy with Langtoft, Lincolnshire and Lanquetot (Normandy, \"Languetot\" 12th century).\n\nIn 1823 Langtoft was a civil parish in the Wapentake of Dickering and the Liberty of St Peter's. Population at the time was 416. Occupations included thirteen farmers, two butchers, three shoemakers, two tailors, two grocers, a blacksmith, a corn miller, a stonemason, and the landlords of the George & Dragon and Nelson public houses. Carriers operated between the village and Driffield once a week.\n\nThe chronicler Pierre de Langtoft took his name from the village. Also resident in the village during the same era was Margaret De Langtoft, who later became one of the five nuns that formed the Sisterhood of Rosedale Priory.\n\nIn the centre of the village is the village green which was a pond, and is still referred to as such by some.\n\nThere is a monument to the villagers who died in the two World Wars.\n\nThe village was flooded in 1657 and 1892. A plaque on the corner of Back Street and Front Street commemorates the floods with the words: \"In commemoration of the great flood of Langtoft April 10th 1657 Height of flood unknown. Also the great flood of Langtoft July 3rd 1892 Height of flood 7½ feet.\"\n\nFront Street floods to a minor extent during heavy rain. In 2007 the 'pond' flooded causing closure of the road.\n\nThe church dedicated to St Peter was designated a Grade I listed building in 1968 and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England.\n\nThe village public house is The Ship Inn which closed in 2015 due to lack of village support. The village shop closed in 2007, and the post office in 2004. Some small businesses are present in the village.\n\nBroadband is available through a scheme to connect all Yorkshire villages by Yorkshire Forward. Broadband is also available over WiFi using Wireless mesh network in a project started before ADSL was made available.\n\nThere used to be a primary school, which closed in July 2013. There is a school-bus service to nearby schools.\nThe village has grown over the past few years with new houses being built. An estate development, however, has currently halted as the site is for sale. The previous developer ran out of money.\n"}

Glycogenin acts as the primer, to which further glucose monomers may be added. It achieves this by catalyzing the addition of glucose to itself (autocatalysis) by first binding glucose from UDP-glucose to the hydroxyl group of Tyr-194. Seven more glucoses can be added, each derived from UDP-glucose, by glycogenin's glucosyltransferase activity. Once sufficient residues have been added, glycogen synthase takes over extending the chain. Glycogenin remains covalently attached to the reducing end of the glycogen molecule.\n\nEvidence accumulates that a priming protein may be a fundamental property of polysaccharide synthesis in general; the molecular details of mammalian glycogen biogenesis may serve as a useful model for other systems.\n\nIn humans, there are two isoforms of glycogenin — glycogenin-1, encoded by GYG1, and expressed in muscle; and glycogenin-2, encoded by GYG2,and expressed in the liver and cardiac muscle, but not skeletal muscle. Patients have been found with defective GYG1, resulting in muscle cells with the inability to store glycogen, and consequential weakness and heart disease.\n\n\n"}

It features music that had previously been released between the mid-1960s and early 1970s, along with a number of previously unreleased tracks and some new recordings from 1990. The box set was issued on October 19, 1990 by Columbia/Legacy and reached number 151 on the \"Billboard\" albums chart.\n\n\"The Byrds\" comprises 90 tracks and covers the band's career from 1965 to 1971 (a period when they were signed to Columbia Records) in roughly chronological order, but excludes material from their 1973 reunion album \"Byrds\", which was released on Asylum Records. The Byrds' lead guitarist, Roger McGuinn, served as \"musical consultant\" during preparation of the set and also had a hand in deciding the final track listing. At the time of its release, \"The Byrds\" was the first box set by a defunct rock act to be issued by Columbia Records.\n\nThe compilation includes a number of rare and previously unreleased songs, many of which were later included as bonus tracks on the remastered editions of the band's individual albums. Of special interest to fans of both the Byrds and country rock pioneer Gram Parsons, was the inclusion of six previously unreleased tracks from the recording sessions of the Byrds' 1968 album, \"Sweetheart of the Rodeo\". Of these unreleased tracks, the versions of \"The Christian Life\", \"You Don't Miss Your Water\", and \"One Hundred Years from Now\" featured their original Parsons' lead vocals, which had been removed and replaced by McGuinn and Hillman prior to the release of the album. Author Johnny Rogan has remarked that in the years since \"Sweetheart of the Rodeo\" was issued, these \"lost\" Parsons' vocals had become near-legendary among fans of the band and their inclusion on \"The Byrds\" provided a major selling point for the box set. \n\nThe set also includes six songs performed by a reunited line-up of the Byrds, featuring McGuinn and other original members David Crosby and Chris Hillman. Of these six songs, two were recorded live at the Roy Orbison Tribute Concert on February 24, 1990, and four are new studio recordings dating from August 1990. The two other original members of the Byrds, Gene Clark and Michael Clarke, who were both still living in 1990, did not participate in the reunion.\n\nWhile \"The Byrds\" does provide a detailed overview of the band's music, there has been some criticism from fans and critics concerning the absence of songs written by Clark, who was the band's principal songwriter in its early years. In particular, the exclusion of popular and highly regarded Clark-penned songs such as \"Set You Free This Time\" and \"Here Without You\" was interpreted by many fans as an attempt on McGuinn's part to downplay Clark's importance in the group. The additional failure of McGuinn to mention Clark in the box set's booklet, while at the same time praising Crosby and Hillman, served to reinforce the notion that Clark was being intentionally slighted. \n\nUpon release, the box set reached number 151 on the \"Billboard\" Top Pop Albums chart in the U.S., during a chart stay of four weeks, but failed to reach the UK Albums Chart. A single disc selection from the box set, titled \"20 Essential Tracks from the Boxed Set: 1965–1990\", was also released in January 1992. The first 16 tracks on this single disc collection date from the Byrds' 1965 to 1971 period, while the final 4 tracks are from the 1990 reunion.\n\n\"The Byrds\" is currently out of print, but a later revised box set, titled \"There Is a Season\", was released on September 26, 2006 by Columbia/Legacy. While this second box set is meant to replace \"The Byrds\", each set contains some tracks that the other does not.\n\nNOTES: \n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2213228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2213228", "title": "August Friedrich Gfrörer", "text": "August Friedrich Gfrörer\n\nAugust Friedrich Gfrörer (5 March 18036 July 1861) was a German historian.\n\nHe was born at Calw, in Württemberg. Obedient to the wishes of his parents, but against his own inclinations, he devoted himself to the study of theology; was a student at the \"Little Evangelical Seminary\" of Tübingen from 1817–21, and from 1821-25 continued his studies at the higher seminary of the same place. He completed his education by a series of scientific travels through Switzerland and Italy, during part of the time acting as companion and secretary to Charles de Bonstetten, after which he returned to his \"alma mater\".\n\nIn 1829, he was appointed vicar in the city of Stuttgart. Having by this time lost all belief in revealed religion, he became convinced that to continue his pastoral duties would involve him in serious conflict; he therefore resigned his vicarage. At the recommendation of Victor von Bonstetten, a friend of his father, he was appointed third librarian of the public library of Stuttgart (1830) with the title of professor. During his numerous hours of leisure he applied himself with vigour and enthusiasm to the study of literature and history. As the fruit of these labours he published in the following year (1831) his work on \"Philo und die judisch-alexandrinische Theosophie\" (2 vols., Stuttgart, 1831). This work was preparatory to his larger work entitled \"Kritische Geschichte des Urchristenthums\" (Stuttgart, 1838, in 5 vols.). In it Gfrörer, probably impelled by David Strauss's \"Leben Jesu\", sought to conceive historically the life and teaching of Christ, and, although writing as a rationalist throughout, he strongly disclaims being \"an adherent of the modern champion of negative truths\", (i.e. of Strauss).\n\nIn the first part, with the sub-title \"Das Jahr des Heils\", he investigates the time in which Christ lived; in the second, entitled \"Heilige Sage\", he treats of the authenticity and literary character of the first three Gospels, and in the third, \"Das Heiligthum und die Wahrheit\", he discusses the \"Gospel of John\". The work, therefore, is a detailed investigation of the character and significance of the New Testament from an historical point of view, and is based on a wealth of materials. At the same time he studied the history of the Thirty Years' War, and in 1835 (in Stuttgart) published \"Gustav Adolf, König der Schweden und seine Zeit\" (4th ed., 1863), in which by emphasizing the political role of the Swedish king he took a position diametrically opposed to the views previously held by Protestants.\n\nAn equally profound impression, especially in Catholic circles, was produced by his \"Allgemeine Kirchengeschichte\" (4 vols., Stuttgart, 1841–46). Closing with the year 1305, it emphasises the part played by the Catholic Church in the development of the German Empire, and extols the policy of the popes. Shortly afterwards he was appointed professor of history at the Catholic University of Freiburg (Breisgau) -- an appointment which at first sight appears surprising, inasmuch as he was a rationalist, the results of those investigations were not at all times in harmony with Christian doctrine. His call, however, is quite intelligible in view of the tendencies of his recent writings, and of his fair treatment of religious questions, which seemed to indicate a gradual return to more conservative religious opinions. In 1848, he was elected to the German Parliament at Frankfurt as representative of a district of Württemberg; he belonged to the greater German party, and was a fanatical opponent of Prussia. It is a notable fact that, while in Parliament, he proposed a motion for the reunion of Catholics and Protestants, but only on condition that the Holy See would promise never to permit the Jesuits or Redemptorists to settle on German soil.\n\nIn 1853 he entered the Catholic Church, after all the other members of his family had taken the same step. His later publications are: \"Geschichte der ost- und westfränkischen Karolinger\" (Freiburg, 1848, 2 vols.); \"Die Urgeschichte des menschlichen Geschlechts\" (Schaffhausen, 1855, 2 vols., incomplete), a demonstration that neither critical history nor the natural sciences, in treating of the origin and earliest history of the human race, can lay claim to certainty, when opposed to the earliest traditions of mankind and especially to Holy Writ; \"Papst Gregorius VIII and sein Zeitalter\" (Schaffhausen, 1859–61, in 7 vols.), a part of his \"Church History\", notable for its brilliant scholarship and conscientious research. Many volumes of lectures were published posthumously: \"Geschichte des 18. Jahrhunderts\" (Schaffhausen, 1862–73; Vols. I-IV by Johann Baptist Weiss; second part of the fourth vol. by Tiedemann, Basle, 1884); \"Zur Geschichte deutscher Volksrechte im Mittelalter\" (Schaffhausen, 1865, 2 vols.); \"Byzantinische Geschichten\" (Graz, 1872–74, 2 vols.). His \"Prophetae veteres pseudepigraphi latine versi\" (Stuttgart, 1840), with translation, is critically unsatisfactory.\n\nGfrörer was a man of unusual ability; he possessed great acumen and great powers of bold and correct combination. He was a prolific author, although his literary researches were sometimes lacking in method. He died at Karlsbad.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Following the departure of several bandmembers, the album was recorded largely as the core duo of Trish Keenan and James Cargill, and as such is considered to have a rawer and more stripped back sound than previous Broadcast releases. It was released on 19 September 2005 by Warp. Upon its release, \"Tender Buttons\" received acclaim from critics but failed to place in international charts. \"America's Boy\", the lead and only single from the album, peaked at No. 139 in the UK Singles Chart.\n\nThe album remains their most recent album that isn't a collaborative project or a soundtrack.\n\nUpon its release, \"Tender Buttons\" received critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews and ratings from mainstream critics, the album received a score of 76, based on 21 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". AllMusic writer Heather Phares said that the album \"strips [the band's] luminous electronic pop down to its barest essence\" and \"has a uniquely fresh, modern feel. Sparingly applied beats, intricate but subtle guitars, and hazy synths dominate the album, providing a restrained backdrop for Keenan's quietly commanding voice and crossword-puzzle lyrics.\" \"The Guardian\"s David Peschek wrote that \"Broadcast's recent records have often seemed too cluttered with effects\" but that on \"Tender Buttons\" the band \"managed to find a halfway house between this always engaging but fussed-at sound and … resonant, muscular psychedelia\". In a positive review, Paul Woloszyn of \"musicOMH\" said that the album \"takes you to another planet with a sonic soundscape lent from Stereolab, but developed to be distinctly Broadcast\", and referred to the album as \"arguably their finest moment\".\n\nWriting for \"Stylus Magazine\", Jeff Siegel said that \"on its surface, [\"Tender Buttons\"] seems like such a simple little curlicue, all Mother Goose coos, descending-scale melodies, and no-wave screech over dinky drum-machine patters … no mucking around in different time signatures, no showy genre fusions, just a single idea … most acts would falter here, but Broadcast pull it off with an easy grace and breezy elegance\". \"PopMatters\" reviewer Adrien Begrand wrote that \"instead of finding a comfortable middle ground, there's more of a sense of tension to the proceedings, the vocal hooks lulling you, only to have electronic noise jolt you awake\", further referring to \"Tender Buttons\" as \"rewarding [and] their boldest album to date.\" \"Pitchfork\"s David Raposa was more reserved in his praise, saying that the band \"bring the melodies, but then dress their poptastic efforts with whatever ruckus they can conjure\" and \"there's no … stand-out track on this album (and there's certainly no 'oh wow' moments)\" but concluding that \"this is still a Broadcast album, meaning it's one of the better things you'll put in your ear this year.\"\n\nIn 2018, \"Pitchfork\" ranked \"Tender Buttons\" at number seven on its list of the 30 best dream pop albums.\n\nAll personnel credits adapted from \"Tender Buttons\" album notes.\n\n\n\n"}

Within the field of mistake in English law, it holds that common mistake does not lead to a void contract unless the mistake is fundamental to the identity of the contract.\n\nLever Brothers Ltd (which merged in 1930 to become Unilever) was a company which traded in West Africa, through a 99% owned subsidiary called the Niger Company (formerly the Royal Niger Company). The Niger trade was in trouble. Lord Leverhulme, the owner of Lever Bros, hired D'Arcy Cooper (a Quaker and senior partner of his uncle's accountant firm, Cooper Brothers) to be the chairman and manage the crisis. Cooper negotiated a loan from Barclays Bank, which insisted that a professional management run the Niger subsidiary. So, Cooper hired his friend, Ernest Hyslop Bell, a senior Barclays manager in 1923 as chairman of the subsidiary. Mr Snelling, a tax consultant that had successfully got Lever Bros a big tax refund in 1921, was appointed as vice chairman. They did well, and turned a profit. The company was then merged with a former competitor (African and Eastern Trade Corporation) to form the United Africa Company in 1929.\n\nBell had wanted to run the new United Africa Company, because he was too old at 54 to have a job in the City, and he had left his Barclays position. At lunch in the Savoy Grill he agreed with Cooper that he would get a big compensation package (£30,000) and retire. A similar \"golden parachute\" of £20,000 was given to Mr Snelling. However, shortly after, it was revealed that Bell and Snelling had been part of a regional cocoa cartel, and used information on future price reductions to sell cocoa from their personal accounts. Lever Brothers Ltd therefore brought a claim for rescission of the compensation package on grounds of mistake of fact.\n\nThe jury found that Bell and Snelling's illicit dealings breached the employment contract and that if the Lever Brothers had known they would not have entered into the agreement. Furthermore, the jury found that at the time of the agreement Bell and Snelling did not have in mind their illicit acts. Wright J therefore held the compensation agreements were void.\n\nOn appeal, the House of Lords found that there was no mistake and the contract could not be rescinded nor was it void on mistake. Lord Atkin was writing for the majority. Dissent was written by Warrington and held that the mistaken assumption was fundamental to the contract, and thus the contract is voidable.\n\nThe Court identified the mistake as a common mistake.\n\nEffectively, the mistake must nullify or negative consent of the parties in order for the agreement to be void.\n\nIn order for the contract to be void by common mistake the mistake must involve the actual subject-matter of the agreement and must be of such a \"fundamental character as to constitute an underlying assumption without which the parties would not have entered into the agreements\".\n\nFrom the facts the Court found that the mistake was not sufficiently close to the actual subject-matter of the agreement. The parties got exactly what they had bargained for.\n\nThe MacMillan article explains that the ratio was in part the result of media attention at the time, and socio-economic context of the trial.\n\nIn an article by JC Smith, \"Contracts- mistake, frustration and implied terms\", it is suggested that \"Bell v. Lever Brothers\" can be analysed into cases of res sua and res extincta.\n\nLever Brothers in substance was buying the right to 'extinguish' Bell and Snelling. Both parties were under the common mistake that Lever Brothers should pay the \"Golden Parachutes\" to Bell and Snelling. Lever Brothers did not know Bell and Snelling were speculating while Bell and Snelling did not know their speculation would entitle Lever Brothers to dismiss them without paying anything.\n\nIn the point of view of Lever Brothers, they are in substance buying a right they already had, that is extinguishing Bell and Snelling without paying a cent. This would be a case of res sua, since you cannot buy something you already have.\n\nIn the point of view of Bell and Snelling, it is the right of entitling the \"Golden Parachutes\" they are selling. This right does not exist since they speculated. The subject-matter they tried to sell, their right, no longer exist before they enter into the contract. This would be a case of res extincta, the disappearance of the subject-matter of the contract.\n\nIn either way, the contract would be void for mistake, though the House of Lords held that the mistake is not fundamental enough.\n\nThe case put a high standard on the finding of common mistake. This was criticized in the later cases written by Lord Denning such as in \"Solle v Butcher\" where Denning LJ reduced the standard by enumerating an equitable remedy for a shared common mistake, which rendered the agreement voidable. Subsequently, in \"Great Peace Shipping Ltd v Tsavliris Salvage (International) Ltd\" (2002) the Court of Appeal purported to overturn \"Solle v Butcher\" and set the standard for common mistake in line with the original \"Bell v Lever Brothers\" standard.\n\nAlso in \"Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society Ltd v Meyer\", Lord Denning remarked the following, in the context to the equivalent of an unfair prejudice action under UK company law. \"Your Lordships were referred to \"Bell v Lever Brothers Ltd\" where Lord Blanesburgh said that a director of one company was at liberty to become a director also of a rival company. That may have been so at that time. But it is at the risk now of an application under section 210 if he subordinates the interests of the one company to those of the other.\"\n\n\n\n"}

For example, Paul Cohen used forcing to establish that ZFC, if consistent, cannot prove the continuum hypothesis, which states that there are exactly aleph-one real numbers.

{"id": "2213275", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2213275", "title": "Portuguese language in Africa", "text": "Portuguese language in Africa\n\nPortuguese is spoken in a number of African countries and is the official language in six African states: Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, São Tomé and Príncipe and Equatorial Guinea. There are Portuguese-speaking communities in most countries of Southern Africa, a mixture of Portuguese settlers and Angolans and Mozambicans who left their countries during the civil wars. A rough estimate has it that there are about 14 million people who use Portuguese as their sole mother tongue across Africa, but depending on the criteria applied, the number might be considerably higher, since many Africans speak Portuguese as a second language, in countries like Angola and Mozambique, where Portuguese is an official language, but also in countries like South Africa and Senegal, thanks to migrants coming from Portuguese speaking countries. Some statistics claim that there are over 30 million Portuguese speakers in the continent. Like French and English, Portuguese has become a post-colonial language in Africa and one of the working languages of the African Union (AU) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC). Portuguese co-exists in Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, and São Tomé and Principe with Portuguese-based creoles (Upper Guinea and Gulf of Guinea Creoles), and in Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea-Bissau with autochthonous African languages (mainly Niger–Congo family languages).\n\nIn Africa, the Portuguese language experiences pressure and possibly competition from French and English. Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau and São Tomé and Príncipe are all members of La Francophonie and Mozambique is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations and has observer status at La Francophonie. Conversely, Equatorial Guinea has announced its decision to introduce Portuguese as its third official language, in addition to Spanish and French, and has been accepted as a member CPLP. Mauritius and Senegal have also joined the CPLP as associate observer members.\n\nThe nation-states with Portuguese as an official language in Africa are referred to by the acronym PALOP () and include the following: Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique and São Tomé and Príncipe. Portuguese is a primarily urban language having a reduced presence in rural areas, except for in Angola and São Tomé and Príncipe, where the language is more widespread.\n\nSouth Africa also has approximately 300,000 speakers of Portuguese, primarily settlers from Madeira and white Angolans and Mozambicans who emigrated from 1975 onwards, following the independence of the former colonies. The civil wars in Angola and Mozambique also resulted in more recent migrations of refugees (some of whom speak Portuguese) to neighbouring countries such as Democratic Republic of Congo, Namibia, Zambia and South Africa. Other migrations involved returning Afro-Brazilian ex-slaves to places such as Nigeria, Benin, Togo, Angola and Mozambique. There are also some returning white Portuguese African refugees and their descendants from Brazil, Portugal, and South Africa to their former African controlled territories, mostly to Angola (up to 500,000) and Mozambique (350,000), and most importantly, there is the arrival of Portuguese post-colonial expatriates in Angola in the recent years, because of Portugal's economic interests and the Angolan economic boom.\n\nSenegal has its own Lusophone connection with a significant community of Cape Verdeans in Dakar and speakers of Guinea-Bissau Creole in its southern region of Casamance, which was once part of the Portuguese colonial empire. Portuguese is taught as a foreign language throughout the country. In 2008, Senegal became an observer nation in the CPLP.\n\nEquatorial Guinea, at one point a Portuguese colony, is home to a Portuguese-based Creole and is a member nation in the CPLP. Portuguese is now an official language in Equatorial Guinea, although it is practically not used.\n\nMauritius, a multilingual island in the Indian Ocean, has strong cultural ties with Mozambique. The Portuguese were the first Europeans to encounter the island. In 2006, Mauritius joined the CPLP as an associate member.\n\nAs a fellow member of the SADC, Zambia has introduced Portuguese language instruction in its primary school system, partially due to the presence of a large Angolan population there.\n\nAs an official language, Portuguese serves in the realms of administration, education, law, politics and media. Given the existing linguistic diversity of the PALOPs, Portuguese also serves the purpose of lingua franca allowing communication between fellow citizens of different ethno-linguistic backgrounds. The standard Portuguese used in education, media and legal documents is based on European Portuguese vocabulary used in Lisbon, but African Portuguese dialects differ from standard European Portuguese both in terms of pronunciation and colloquial vocabulary.\n\nAdditionally, Portuguese connects the PALOP countries to one another and to Portugal, East Timor, Macau and Brazil, itself a former Portuguese colony.\n\nMusic is one way in which the linguistic profiles of PALOP have increased. Many recording artists from PALOP, in addition to singing in their maternal languages, sing in Portuguese to one degree or another. The success of these artists in the world music industry increases international awareness of Portuguese as an African language.\n\nAs a literary language, Portuguese has a strong role in the PALOP. Authors such as Luandino Vieira, Mia Couto, Pepetela, Lopito Feijóo, Luis Kandjimbo, Manuel Rui or Ondjaki have made valuable contributions to lusophone literature, prompting an African scent and ideas to the language and creating a place for the Portuguese language in the African imaginary.\n\nPortuguese is the language of journalism, which serves as a vehicle for the dissemination of the language. Literacy being an issue, radio serves as an important source of information for Lusophone Africans.\n\nBBC Para África, RFI and RTP África have regular services in Portuguese for listeners in Africa.\n\nAs a result of immigration to Portugal various varieties of African Portuguese have influenced contemporary speech in Portugal. In the 1970s, it came from white people from the former colonies (referred to as ). More recent immigration from the PALOPs has had a similar influence.\n\nIn Brazil, many of the indigenous African languages that influence African Portuguese had the same influence historically on the formation of Brazilian Portuguese during the colonial period, especially lexically.\n\nAny discussion of the role of the Portuguese language in Africa must take into account the various Portuguese creoles that have developed there. These creole languages co-exist with Portuguese and, in the countries where they are spoken, form a continuum with the lexifying language.\n\nIn Cape Verde, refers to a variety of Cape Verdean Creole which takes on various features of Portuguese and is a result of processes of decreolization in the archipelago. In São Tome e Principe, Santomense Portuguese is a variety of Portuguese strongly influenced by Forro in syntax and vocabulary. Since the lexicons of those languages are derived from Portuguese, even creole-speakers who do not speak Portuguese have a passive knowledge of it.\n\nIn addition, Portuguese creoles have often been (and often continue to be) written using Portuguese orthography. An important issue in discussions of standardization of creoles is whether it is better to devise a truly phonetic orthography or to choose an etymological one based on Portuguese.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2213278", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2213278", "title": "Karl Abraham", "text": "Karl Abraham\n\nKarl Abraham (; 3 May 1877 – 25 December 1925) was an influential German psychoanalyst, and a collaborator of Sigmund Freud, who called him his 'best pupil'.\n\nAbraham was born in Bremen, Germany. His parents were Nathan Abraham, a Jewish religion teacher (1842 – 1915) and his wife (and cousin) Ida (1847 – 1929). His studies in medicine enabled him to take a position at the Burghölzli Swiss Mental Hospital, where Eugen Bleuler practiced. The setting of this hospital initially introduced him to the psychoanalysis of Carl Gustav Jung.\n\nIn 1907, he had his first contact with Sigmund Freud, with whom he developed a lifetime relationship. Returning to Germany, he founded the Berliner Society of Psychoanalysis in 1910. He was the president of the International Psychoanalytical Association from 1914 to 1918 and again in 1925.\n\nKarl Abraham collaborated with Freud on the understanding of manic-depressive illness, leading to Freud's paper on 'Mourning and Melancholia' in 1917. He was the analyst of Melanie Klein during 1924–1925, and of a number of other British psychoanalysts, including Edward Glover, James Glover, and Alix Strachey. He was a mentor for an influential group of German analysts, including Karen Horney, Helene Deutsch, and Franz Alexander. \n\nKarl Abraham studied the role of infant sexuality in character development and mental illness and, like Freud, suggested that if psychosexual development is fixated at some point, mental disorders will likely emerge. He described the personality traits and psychopathology that result from the oral and anal stages of development (1921). Abraham observed his only daughter Hilda Abraham reporting on her reaction to enemas and infantile masturbation by her brother. He asked that secrets be shared with him but he was careful to respect her privacy and some reports were not published until after Hilda.s death. Hilda was later to become a psychoanalyst.\n\nIn the oral stage of development, the first relationships children have with objects (caretakers) determine their subsequent relationship to reality. Oral satisfaction can result in self-assurance and optimism, whereas oral fixation can lead to pessimism and depression. Moreover, a person with an oral fixation will present a disinclination to take care of him/herself and will require others to look after him/her. This may be expressed through extreme passivity (corresponding to the oral benign suckling substage) or through a highly active oral-sadistic behaviour (corresponding to the later sadistic biting substage).\n\nIn the anal stage, when the training in cleanliness starts too early, conflicts may result between a conscious attitude of obedience and an unconscious desire for resistance. This can lead to traits such as frugality, orderliness and obstinacy, as well as to obsessional neurosis as a result of anal fixation (Abraham, 1921). \nIn addition, Abraham based his understanding of manic-depressive illness on the study of the painter Segantini: an actual event of loss is not itself sufficient to bring the psychological disturbance involved in melancholic depression. This disturbance is linked with disappointing incidents of early childhood; in the case of men always with the mother (Abraham, 1911). This concept of the prooedipal “bad” mother was a new development in contrast to Freud’s oedipal mother and paved the way for the theories of Melanie Klein (May-Tolzmann, 1997).\n\nAnother important contribution is his work “A short study of the Development of the Libido”, where he elaborated on Freud’s “Mourning and Melancholia” (1917) and demonstrated the vicissitudes of normal and pathological object relations and reactions to object loss.\n\nMoreover, Abraham investigated child sexual trauma and, like Freud, proposed that sexual abuse was common among psychotic and neurotic patients. Furthermore, he argued (1907) that dementia praecox is associated with child sexual trauma, based on the relationship between hysteria and child sexual trauma demonstrated by Freud.\n\nAbraham (1920) also showed interest in cultural issues. He analyzed various myths suggesting their relation to dreams (1909) and wrote an interpretation of the spiritual activities of the Egyptian monotheistic Pharaoh Amenhotep IV (1912).\n\nAbraham died prematurely on December 25, 1925, from complications of a lung infection and may have suffered from lung cancer.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Bohlen was a strong supporter of the creation of Greenpeace International and the move of the group's headquarters from Vancouver to New York City, essentially giving birth to Greenpeace as we know it today. He was also instrumental in developing the group's hierarchical military-style command structure.\n\nHe made a similar and even less-acknowledged contribution to Green politics in Canada by negotiating a deal that ended the party's 10-year prohibition against Green Parties having leaders at a meeting of the Green Party of BC in 1992.

The summits were not meant to be linked formally with wider international institutions; and in fact, a mild rebellion against the stiff formality of other international meetings was a part of the genesis of cooperation between France's President Giscard d'Estaing and West Germany's Chancellor Helmut Schmidt as they conceived the initial summit of the Group of Six (G6) in 1975.\n\nThe G8 summits during the 21st-century have inspired widespread debates, protests and demonstrations; and the two- or three-day event becomes more than the sum of its parts, elevating the participants, the issues and the venue as focal points for activist pressure.\n\nThe 2002 conference is said to have cost $300-million with potential benefits for the Kananaskis economy.\n\nIn response to and support of the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD), the Kananaskis Summit produced an African Action Plan, which contained commitments on promoting peace and security; strengthening institutions and governance; fostering trade, economic growth and sustainable development; implementing debt relief; expanding knowledge; improving health and confronting HIV/AIDS; increasing agricultural productivity; and, improving water resource management.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien proposed and carried the Market Access Initiative, so that the then 48 Least developed countries (LDCs) could profit from \"trade-not-aid\".

Developing country quotas were subsequently removed on 1 January 2005, and tariff reduction was to continue until 2010.\n\nFurthermore, the G8 Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction was adopted at the summit; with members committing US$20 billion towards the security of some weapons of mass destruction in former soviet republics.\n\nIn the summit's final communique, one of the unexpected highlights was an announcement that Russia would become a \"true\" full member of the G8. This would be accomplished by allowing it to host its first G8 Summit, starting in 2006. Thus, the rotation of the G8 Presidency was changed, placing Russia between the United Kingdom and Germany.\n\nThe G8 is an unofficial annual forum for the leaders of Canada, the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nThese participants were the \"core members\" of the international forum during the 28th summit:\n\nTraditionally, a host country of the G8 summit sets the agenda for negotiations, which take place primarily amongst multi-national civil servants in the weeks before the summit itself, leading to a joint declaration which all countries can agree to sign. The Presidency of the G8 is held by the leader of a current national government, whether it is a president, prime minister or chancellor (with Germany) of that particular G8 country. It lasts from January 1 to December 31 of such year.\n\nThe summit was intended as a venue for resolving differences among its members. As a practical matter, the summit was also conceived as an opportunity for its members to give each other mutual encouragement in the face of difficult economic decisions.\n\nThe previous summit, the 27th G8 summit, in Genoa, Italy was the site of large anti-globalization protests and occasionally violent conflict between protesters and the police. In contrast to Genoa, most of the area near was closed to the public during the summit, and protesters were kept far away, mainly in Calgary. The protests were peaceful, attended by groups including the Raging Grannies.\n\nKananaskis was selected because of its isolated location. Security was augmented by CF-188 jet fighters, air-to-air refuelling aircraft and helicopters which patrolled the skies non-stop; all major thoroughfares were closed, many of the shops in nearby Calgary were boarded up, and police reportedly outnumbered protesters six to one. It was the largest peacetime security operation in Canadian history.\n\nSecurity was very tight at the summit, costing taxpayers in excess of $200 million. It attracted thousands of protesters and security was provided by 5,000 to 7,000 police and military officers. This was the first G-8 summit held after the September 11, 2001 attacks.\n\nFor some, the G8 summit became a profit-generating event; as for example, the official \"G8 Summit\" magazines which have been published under the auspices of the host nations for distribution to all attendees since 1998.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2213338", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2213338", "title": "Manchester Parish", "text": "Manchester Parish\n\nThe Parish of Manchester is an administrative civil parish located in west-central Jamaica, in the county of Middlesex. Its capital, Mandeville, is a major business centre, and the only parish capital not located on the coast or on a major river. Its St. Paul of the Cross Pro-Cathedral is the episcopal see of the Latin Catholic Diocese of Mandeville.\n\nTaino/Arawak settlement in the parish was substantiated when in 1792, a surveyor found three carvings, believed to be Amerindian Zemi, in a cave in the Carpenter's Mountains. They are now at the British Museum.\n\nManchester was formed in 1814, by an Act of the House of Assembly, making it one of the newest parishes of Jamaica. It was formed as a result of the amalgamation of portions of the parishes St. Elizabeth, Clarendon and the entirety of Vere. The amalgamation was done in response to a petition from the inhabitants of Mile Gully, May Pen and Carpenters Mountain who complained that they were too far away from an administrative centre. Manchester was named in honour of the William Montagu, 5th Duke of Manchester, the then Governor of Jamaica. He was governor for 19 years, setting the record as the longest-serving governor of the island. The capital town, Mandeville, established in 1816, was named after his eldest son, Lord Mandeville.\n\nNo sugar estates can be found in the parish; slaves worked on coffee plantations. After emancipation, the ex-slaves became independent coffee farmers. The irish potato was first introduced to Jamaica at Bethany, a town in the parish. Citrus also became an important crop, as in 1920, the citrus fruit ortanique, a cross between the orange and tangerine, was developed by Charles Jackson.\n\nMany of Jamaica's businesses were started in Mandeville; the Mandeville Hotel, one of the oldest in the Caribbean, began operations in 1875. The first \"Free Library\" in Jamaica was established in 1938, and is the oldest Parish Library.\n\nThe growth of the town was given a substantial stimulus when Alcan Bauxite Company opened operations there. It built houses for its then mostly expatriate staff. The relatively high wages lured many educated Jamaicans there. Mandeville continues to grow rapidly due to it being considered one of the most attractive towns in Jamaica and the cleanest of them all.\n\nMandeville boasts no fewer than 14 shopping centres, two hospitals (one public and one private), medical centres and many doctors. Next to Kingston, it provides the best medical services in the island, a major asset for tourism development.\n\nThe population of Manchester is 190,812. Mandeville, the capital and chief town of the parish, has a Mayor, Brenda Ramsay and a deputy mayor, Irving Facey. It has a population of over 30,485.\n\nMandeville, the parish capital is located at latitude 17°51'N, longitude 77°38'W. Manchester is bordered by St. Elizabeth in the west, Clarendon in the east and by Trelawny in the north. Manchester covers an area of 830 km², making it Jamaica's sixth largest parish. It has three mountain ranges — the Carpenters Mountains, the May Day Mountains and the Don Figuerero Mountains. The highest point is above sea level in the Carpenters Mountains.\n\nOver 90% of the parish's surface is limestone so there is an abundance of cockpits, sinkholes, caves and underground passages. Gourie Cave, near Christiana, is the longest of the over 100 caves in the parish, as well as the longest known cave in Jamaica (3505m). Smokey Hole Cave, in Cross Keys, is the deepest known cave on the island (194m). Oxford Cave, near Auchtembeddie, in the NW part of the parish, is another of the major speleological sites found in Manchester, and was once noted as a roosting site for the now possibly extinct bat species \"Phyllonycteris aphylla\". Manchester also has large bauxite deposits, with parts of the parish having been strip-mined as a result, notably in William's Field, Hope and Blue Mountain.\n\nThe parish offers a variety of climate, vegetation and scenery. The capital, Mandeville, is situated at an elevation of . The town is noted for its climate, and temperatures range from a low of in December and January, to a high of in July and August. There are very few rivers in the parish, and the existing ones are rather small; Alligator Hole River, Alligator Pond River, Gut River, Hector's River, Two Rivers and Swift River. Hector's River runs along the border of Manchester and Trelawny, sinks at Troy where it flows underground for approximately six kilometres\nand rises below Oxford Cave as One Eye River. Despite this, water supply is generally scarce; the southern districts often suffer drought.\n\nThere is no large-scale cultivation of crops as the area is generally mountainous. Crops such as sugar cane require large tracts of flat land. Bananas, coffee and pimento, annatto, ginger are grown, and the parish is noted for its citrus; oranges, ortaniques and grapefruit, much of which are exported. Christiana, north of Mandeville, is the second largest town of the parish. The Christiana Land Authority assists agricultural development in the region. Irish potato is grown considerably in the Christiana area and it is the centre of a large banana and ginger-growing district.\n\nManchester is a centre of the bauxite mining industry. The first bauxite mining companies were Alcan and Alpart. Alcan, a large world-renowned Canadian company, had a strong presence in the town and was one of the main employers. It lured many Jamaicans because of high salaries and the benefits offered. Alpart, short for Aluminum Partners of Jamaica, was initially formed as a joint venture of Kaiser Aluminum, Reynolds Aluminum, and Anaconda. It is still in operation in Nain St Elizabeth parish, however it is now jointly owned by UC Rusal of Russia and Hydro Aluminum of Norway.\n\nThe parish created the Manchester Local Sustainable Development Plan in 2007 to improve the community over the next 20 years.\n\n\nCaptain Alexander Woodburn Heron's tomb at the top of Shooter's Hill, now called \"Heron Hill\" by the locals.\n\nRoxborough Estate birthplace of Jamaica's National Hero and First Premier, the Right Excellent Norman Washington Manley.\n\nSecondary high\n\nTechnical high\n\nPrivate high\n\nThere are several notable tertiary institutions, the Northern Caribbean University (NCU), a Seventh-day Adventist institution, formerly called West Indies College, the Church Teacher's College, Mandeville, The Catholic College, Knox Community College, Cobbla and Mandeville Campuses. There are also other religious-based institutions located in the parish: Regent College of the Caribbean (the former Jamaica Bible College) as well as Bethel Bible College.\n\n\n\n"}

Subsequently, she trained in London as a psychiatric nurse, becoming a Registered Nurse (RN) and a Psychiatric Nurse (PN) before returning to Canada. Bridgman went on to earn the Director of Nursing designation from the University of Saskatchewan, rising to become a nurse administrator.\n\nIn September 1993, the designated Reform Party candidate for Surrey North resigned his nomination. Bridgman was President of the Surrey North Reform Party Constituency Association, and she was selected to run as the Reform Party candidate. On October 25, 1993, Margaret Bridgman was elected the Member of Parliament for Surrey North, unseating the incumbent with a plurality of 6413 votes. Prior to Bridgman's landmark victory, Surrey North and its predecessor ridings had been held either by the New Democratic Party or the Progressive Conservative Party since 1958.\n\nBridgman served as the Reform Party Critic on Health and Assistant Critic on Indian Affairs and Northern Development. She sat as the Reform Party member of the House of Commons Standing Committees on Health and on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development, during the 35th Parliament. In her maiden speech in the House of Commons, Bridgman focused on the need for more effective and cost-conscious funding of health care in Canada. Bridgman's interventions in the House of Commons ranged from remarks on health care and Indian Affairs to young offenders, old age security, and the spending priorities of the Canadian parliament.\n\nIn 1997, Bridgman was successfully challenged for the Reform Party nomination by Chuck Cadman. Bridgman opted not to run as an independent in the 1997 general election, and she did not run, again, in a federal, electoral race.\n\nFollowing the 1997 election, Bridgman returned to nursing in Surrey, British Columbia.

{"id": "2213397", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2213397", "title": "Teachings and impacts of Ayyavazhi", "text": "Teachings and impacts of Ayyavazhi\n\nThe Ayyavazhi includes a corpus of teachings of its initiator Lord Vaikundar in the\nform of instructions and slogans found in the religious book \"Akilathirattu\".\n\nThe teachings on Dharmam have two levels of understanding: a principle of 'righteousness', and a concrete activity of 'charity' or 'almsgiving'. As a principle, the followers of Ayyavazhi believed that the prime motive of the mission of Vaikundar was to establish Dharmam in this world by destroying the evil force of Kali. It is said in Akilathirattu that people, even while listening to the teachings of Lord Vaikundar, 'realised' that the evil of Kali was gradually being withdrawn from the world and that Dharmam was being established in its stead. Transposed to the social plane, this principle of Dharmam was considered as the mission of \"protecting or salvaging the lowly, the oppressed.\" As a practical activity, Dharmam meant charity and almsgiving. This was taught to be the way to seek God. People were specially exhorted to undertake charity by means of material goods, and do it without discriminating among the beneficiaries.\n\nPart of Lord Vaikundar's teachings included symbolic actions for the purpose of incinerating the evil spirits and impounding the powers of those practising black magic. These were purported to instill courage among the ordinary people. He also imparted direct teachings on courage and fortitude. People were instructed not to fear any supernatural or temporal powers of malignant or inimical character. They were exhorted \"not to fear anyone except Vaikundar,\" whose abiding presence with them would be the source of their strength. They were told that \"it was fortitude that would make them rule the earth\" and that because of this, they were not to be intimidated by any exploiter.\n\n\"If you live with dignity and self-respect, the Kali would destroy itself\" is another oft-repeated verse from Akilathirattu. The importance of this instruction comes to light when considering that the destruction of Kali is projected in Akilathirattu as one of the chief motives of the mission of Lord Vaikundar. The book, through various other narratives, underscores the point that the people are to live in dignity. For example, the narrative on the origin of the Santror Makkal as the children of Narayana endowed the people with a divine pedigree, and it was a powerful story to drive home the message that the people were a dignified humanity. Some of the rituals that emerged in the life of Ayyavazhi were aimed at indoctrinating the message of human dignity. Wearing a piece of headgear during worship is an example of one of these rituals.\n\nAkilathirattu projected to the imagination of the followers of Ayyavazhi an ideal society where the caste discrimination did not exist. In its account of the past, Akilattirattu speaks of an age in which people lived as one family without the discrimination of caste. It blames the kalineesan for dividing the people on the basis of caste. It speaks of a future when Vaikundar will rule all the people with equality.\n\nOther verses from Akilathirattu, such as\npoint to the fact of a considerable indoctrination against the inequalities of castes.\n\nA very strong critique of the political oppressors seems to have been operative in Ayyavazhi. In the first place, it was expressed in the very characterisation of the Thiruvithankur king as Kalineesan, the representative of the evil force, and of the British as Venneesan (the wicked white). Kalineesan was projected to be the main oppressor who perpetrated the rule of Kali by exploiting the labour of the people through the systems of oozhiyam and levies, and by imposing the discriminatory caste system. Akilattirattu indicts the king as the cause of oppression and issues admonitions to him to revoke the exploitative measures.\n\nA slogan having political overtones seems to have been heard repeatedly in the gatherings of Ayyavazhi. It came as a declaration from Ayya Vaikundar that he was going to dethrone the king and rule the country under a Single Umbrella. Among the many accusations raised against Ayya Vaikundar, the one that he would overthrow the rule of kings was among the most serious.\n\nStrong discontent against the deeply entrenched exploitation of the labouring masses was expressed in the form of poetic lamentations that were repeated and commented upon in the gatherings of Ayyavazhi. Akilathirattu devotes three full pages to enumerating and lamenting upon the innumerable exploitative measures imposed on the toiling masses, primarily on the Chanars. It lists a number of oppressive taxes (imposed on items such as firewood and the implements of the people's occupation). It also speaks about the varieties of taxes levied on land and cultivation and narrates the way the exploitative system of oozhiyam burdened the people. In a very telling statement, Akilathirattu summarises its accusation that \"the treacherous neesan squeezed out the labour and its produce from the Santror.\"\n\nThere are also certain verses found in Akilathirattu and Arul Nool which are in the form of instructions. A verse in Akilathirattu says, \"Whoever makes an earning, let him rule over it and no one need be lightened of another.\" Another verse proclaims, \"Tell that there is no Sevies to be paid anymore.\" There are also verses that call for revolutionary actions from the followers. For example, a section in Arul Nool goes as follows:\n\nLord Vaikundar also offered a strong admonition to the followers of Ayyavazhi against conducting Puja (making offerings to temples and undertaking blood sacrifices to appease evil spirits). This admonition is repeated in several places in Akilattirattuu and Arul Nool. Instructions to give up \"devil worship,\" idol worship, sacrifices of goats, roosters and pigs to deities, offerings of eggs, fried meat and other edibles were explicitly present in Ayyavazhi. Ayya Vaikundar is shown to be proclaiming these admonitions as a titular message to his mission as soon as he emerged from the sea after the Transformation.\n\nThe people had their own folk practices, such as peikkuk kotuttal (offering to demons) or cetikkuk kotuttal (offering to evil spirits), to appease the evil spirits. Ayya Vaikundar instructed the people not to observe these practices. One of the main instructions of Ayyavazhi was that there were neither devils nor demons and that witchcraft and sorcery had no effect.\n\nLord Vaikundar and other prominent persons of Ayyavazhi made many statements lamenting the alleged domination of the Brahmins. One such statement by Vaikundar is found in Patthiram \"We come to intimidate the veta Brahmins.\" Another statement of the same kind is found in Thingal patham which says, \"Those who wear a tuft (Brahmins) will not remain on this earth any longer\". Apart from these open statements, certain mythical episodes implicating the Brahmins are too conspicuous to be missed. For example, the mythical narrative blames the Brahmins for consuming the whole of the nectar that is meant for all humanity, and on that account, condemns them to grow on earth as palmyra trees.\n\nAnother episode which alleges corrupt and immoral practices by the Brahmin priests at Srirangam and Thiruchendur cannot obviously be missed. The followers of Ayyavazhi were called upon to don the mantle of priesthood in the place of the Brahmins.\n\nUnlike the other Indian religious systems, Ayyavazhi condemns idolatry. On its view, leading all sort of meaningless ritualistic practices and giving birth to superstition, the idol-worship led the priest to exploit the illiteracy and ignorance of the common people. Hence Ayya denounced idolatry and compelled his followers to detest and resist the same.\n\nDuring the period of Lord Vaikundar the lower caste people of the South Travancore are not allowed to enter the temples. So they erected small pyramids of mud or brick and use to worship them. Ayya found these practises as uncivilised custom and put forward a new way of worship. This serves as a religious reformation in the socio-cultural history of South Travancore. There are quite a large number of verses in the Ayyavazhi scriptures on strengthening this view of Vaikundar.\n\nPathis and Nizhal Thangals were centres of worship and religious learning established in different parts of the country by devout followers of Ayyavazhi. Few were established even during the time of Lord Vaikundar, and they served as centres for propagation of the beliefs and practices of Ayyavazhi.\n\nFrom among the large number of followers, Vaikundar seems to have chosen five persons to be called as his (Citars)disciples. They are Sivanandi from Mailadi, Pandaram from Kailasapuram, Arjunan from Pillayarkudiyirruppu, Subbiah from Colachel, and Hari Gopalan from Thamaraikulam. Vaikundar seems to have chosen these disciples to be his close associates and to propagate his teaching and ideals to the people. According to Akilathirattu, the Pandavas of previous Dwapara yuga were made to take birth in this Kali yuga as Citars of Vaikundar. The holy book Akilathirattu was compiled by his fifth citar - Hari Gopalan alias Sahadeva.\n\nSociologically speaking, Lord Vaikundar was the tenth avatar of Lord Narayana and first to succeed as a social renaissance as well as religious reformation in the country. It also created many social changes in southern India impinging greatly on society highly resulting in social and self-respect movements broke out such as \"Upper cloth agitation\", temple entry agitation etc.\n\nThere is also a view that Swami Vivekananda too was influenced by Ayyavazhi teachings. Historians view that that Vivekananda visited the Swamithope Pathi during his visit to Kanyakumari in December 1892 and he was impressed by the principles behind rituals of this monistic faith, such as wearing a head gear during worship in temple, worshipping in front of mirror etc., and started wearing a turban from then on. Paulose suggests that Vivekananda received some spiritual instructions from the disciples of Lord Vaikundar.\n\n"}

During their later careers in World Championship Wrestling, they were billed as \"brothers\". The team formed in 1999 as a parody of the original Hollywood Blonds. Their gimmick saw them entering the ring wearing glitter and licking Blow Pops. In the ring, they also devised a unique stalling vertical suplex, flying crossbody combination. After being removed from television by Turner Broadcasting System Standards and Practices, the team briefly reformed as Standards and Practices, a satirical reference to the S&P of Turner, before disbanding in 2000.\n\nIn June 1999 Lenny approached Lodi and stated \"\"They're not doing much with me and they're not doing much with you. Why don't we form a tag team?\"\" Lane had been inspired by a Saturday Night Live vignette featuring \"The Ambiguously Gay Duo\". WCW management were initially reluctant, but booker Kevin Nash approved the idea, and Lane and Lodi were renamed The West Hollywood Blondes (as opposed to the more famous Hollywood Blonds, \"Stunning\" Steve Austin and Brian Pillman). The Blondes were implied to be homosexuals, wearing pink trunks emblazoned with large pink triangles (a symbol of the gay community) and with Lane sporting pigtails, facial glitter and a lollipop. Controversially, the Blondes were later revealed to be brothers. The Blondes were an effective heel tag team, though they rarely won matches.\n\nIn an upset victory, Lane defeated Rey Mysterio, Jr. on the August 19 episode of \"WCW Thunder\" in Lubbock, Texas to win the WCW World Cruiserweight Championship. With the assistance of Lodi, he defended the title successfully throughout the next six weeks. On the October 3 episode of \"WCW Monday Nitro\", Psychosis was announced as having defeated Lane for the World Cruiserweight Championship at an unspecified house show. Lane had already been set to lose the title to Disco Inferno that night, but WCW management was worried about a possible incident. Lane didn't appear that night and Psychosis defended and lost the title to Disco instead.\n\nThe Blondes were taken off television in the same month following protests from the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, who threatened to organize a boycott of WCW, claiming that \"\"The character of Lenny is presented with the intention to incite the crowd to the most base homophobic behavior\"\" and \"\"the audience's reaction [to Lenny Lane and Lodi being physically attacked by other wrestlers] gives permission to viewers to do harm to gay people in a very literal way\".\".\n\nThey returned as \"Standards and Practices\", a censorious duo who opposed the \"adult themes\" present in WCW. In a drastic departure from their previous appearance, they wore designer suits, carried briefcases and were accompanied by a secretary, Miss Hancock. She would often stand in the ring or on the announcers table and do a sultry dance. This would distract not only their opponents but Lenny and Lodi as well. Miss Hancock later left Lenny and Lodi, and Standards and Practices became simply XS until they both left or were released from WCW. Standards and Practices was supposedly an attempt to mock the conservative views of WCW management, and was not unlike the Right to Censor faction the WWF would have shortly afterwards due to complaints from the Parents Television Council over their programming.

{"id": "2213412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2213412", "title": "Parmigianino", "text": "Parmigianino\n\nGirolamo Francesco Maria Mazzola (11 January 150324 August 1540), also known as Francesco Mazzola or, more commonly, as Parmigianino (, , ; \"the little one from Parma\"), was an Italian Mannerist painter and printmaker active in Florence, Rome, Bologna, and his native city of Parma. His work is characterized by a \"refined sensuality\" and often elongation of forms and includes \"Vision of Saint Jerome\" (1527) and the iconic if somewhat untypical \"Madonna with the Long Neck\" (1534), and he remains the best known artist of the first generation whose whole careers fall into the Mannerist period.\n\nHis prodigious and individual talent has always been recognised, but his career was disrupted by war, especially the Sack of Rome in 1527, three years after he moved there, and then ended by his death at only 37. He produced outstanding drawings, and was one of the first Italian painters to experiment with printmaking himself. While his portable works have always been keenly collected and are now in major museums in Italy and around the world, his two large projects in fresco are in a church in Parma and a palace in a small town nearby. This in conjunction with their lack of large main subjects has resulted in their being less well known than other works by similar artists. He painted a number of important portraits, leading a trend in Italy towards the three-quarters or full-length figure, previously mostly reserved for royalty. \nParmigianino was the eighth child of Filippo Mazzola and one Donatella Abbati. His father died of the plague two years after Parmigianino's birth, and the children were raised by their uncles, Michele and Pier Ilario, who according to Vasari were modestly talented artists. In 1515, his uncle received a commission from Nicolò Zangrandi for the decoration of a chapel in San Giovanni Evangelista; a work later completed by a young Parmigianino. By the age of eighteen, he had already completed the \"Bardi Altarpiece\". In 1521, Parmigianino was sent to Viadana (along with painter Girolamo Bedoli who was to marry his cousin) to escape the wars between the French, Imperial, and papal armies. In Viadana, he painted two panels in tempera, depicting Saint Francis for the church of the Frati de' Zoccoli, and the \"Mystical Marriage of Saint Catherine\" for San Pietro. He also worked in San Giovanni and met Correggio, who was at work on the fresco decorations of the cupola.\n\nIn 1524, he traveled to Rome with five small paintings, including the \"Circumcision of Jesus\" and his \"Self-portrait in a Convex Mirror\", seeking patronage of the Medici pope, Clement VII. Vasari records that in Rome, Parmigianino was \"celebrated as a Raphael reborn\". In January 1526, Parmigianino and his uncle, Pier Ilario, agreed with Maria Bufalina from Città di Castello, to decorate the church of San Salvatore in Lauro with an altarpiece of the \"Vision of Saint Jerome\" (1526–27, National Gallery, London). Within a year, the Sack of Rome caused Parmigianino, and many other artists, to flee.\n\nHe resided in Bologna for nearly three years. At around 1528, he painted the \"Madonna and Child with Saints\" (Pinacoteca, Bologna), then later in 1528, he painted \"Madonna con la Rosa\" (Dresden) and \"Madonna with Saint Zachariah\" (Uffizi). By 1530 Parmigianino had returned to Parma.\n\nIn 1531, Parmigianino received a commission for two altarpieces, depicting Saint Joseph and Saint John the Baptist, from the unfinished church of Santa Maria della Steccata. The brotherhood overseeing the church advanced him salary and promised him the supplies and materials; however, by 1535, the project was unfinished. In December, he nominated Don Nicola Cassola, a Parman cleric at the Roman Curia, to act as his legal representative. Parmigianino authorized him to collect the 50 gold \"scudi\" from Bonifazio Gozzadini for the \"Madonna with St. John the Baptist and St. Zacharias\".\n\nIn 1534, it was decided that the \"Madonna dal collo lungo\" (the \"Madonna with the Long Neck\") would hang in the chapel of the family of Elena Baiardi.\n\nParmigianino had probably expected to succeed Correggio in the favour of the church. However, in April 1538, the administrative offices commissioned initially Giorgio Gandini del Grano, then Girolamo Bedoli, to decorate the apse and choir of the Parma Cathedral.\n\nIt is believed that at this time, he became a devotee of alchemy. Vasari hypothesizes that this was due to his fascination with magic. Scholars now agree that Parmigianino's scientific interests may have been due to his obsession with trying to find a new medium for his etchings. As a result of his alchemical researches, he completed little work in the church. He was imprisoned for two months for breach of contract after the Confraternita decided unanimously to ban him from continuing in their church. He was replaced between 1539 and 1540 by Giulio Romano, who also promptly withdrew from the contract.\n\nParmigianino died of a fever in Casalmaggiore on 24 August 1540 at the age of 37 years. He is buried in the church of the Servite Friars \"naked with a cross made of cypress wood on his chest\".\n\nAmong those closely influenced by Parmigianino were his cousin Girolamo Mazzuoli and Girolamo's son Alessandro Mazzuoli; Pomponeo Amidano; Giacomo Bertoia; and Francesco Borgani.\n\nParmigianino was also an early Italian etcher, a technique that was pioneered in Italy by Marcantonio Raimondi, but which appealed to draughtsmen. Though the techniques of printing the copper plates required special skills, the ease with which acid, as a substitute for ink, could reproduce the spontaneity of an artist's hand attracted Parmigianino, a \"master of elegant figure drawing\". Parmigianino also designed chiaroscuro woodcuts, and although his output was small he had a considerable influence on Italian printmaking. Some of his prints were done in collaboration with Giovanni Jacopo Caraglio.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2213423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2213423", "title": "Fort Tourgis", "text": "Fort Tourgis\n\nFort Tourgis is an extensive fortification in Alderney to the north west of St Anne forming part of the Fortifications of Alderney.\n\nFort Tourgis, completed in 1855, was designed to accommodate 346 men and was originally to be the largest of Alderney's Victorian forts. It was also designed to mount 33 heavy cannon in five batteries together with four 13-inch mortars. Fort Albert, begun a year later in 1856, was to become the island's largest and most heavily armed fort, but even today Tourgis remains a very impressive structure.\n\nAlderney's Victorian forts were designed to defend the island and its harbour, which was planned to accommodate a British fleet to respond to French naval power in the Channel. From 1860, advances in weapons, particularly the rise of rifled ordnance, and ironclad ship design, made the island's 18 forts and batteries, and the new harbour, increasingly obsolete. However several forts, including Tourgis, were later armed with more modern gun designs. In 1886 the island's defences consisted of 124 guns, mortars and howitzers; by 1893 only Fort Albert and Roselle Battery were armed, with Fort Grosnez having two practice guns manned by the Alderney Militia. By 1908 only Fort Albert with the two newly installed six-inch guns (1901) and Roselle Battery, with its two 12-pounder QF guns, defended the island.\n\nFrom July 1940, after Alderney and the other Channel Islands had been occupied by the Germans, the defences were designed both to protect the sea route from Cherbourg to St Malo, and to resist potential British assault to recapture the only part of the British Isles to be occupied by Germany. Fort Tourgis became Stutzpunkt Türkenburg, or Strongpoint Turk's CastleFort Tourgis has a Citadel containing the barrack block, main magazine and other facilities, together with two small gun batteries, one facing west (three guns) and one east (two guns) in the Redan – see plan. The fort's main armament was located in three major batteries facing seawards. The batteries are separated from each other, and from the Citadel, by ditches and drawbridges.\n\nFollowing extensive clearance and conservation work, co-ordinated by the Living Islands project, with volunteers supported by the States Works department, part of the northern defences of Fort Tourgis is now open to the public. Cambridge Battery (No.2) is an excellent example of how the original Victorian fortifications were adapted by German forces in the Second World War, when Alderney became one of the most heavily fortified sections of Hitler's Atlantic Wall.\n\nBy the 1920s, Alderney was effectively demilitarised, only to have a new lease of life during the Second World War when occupied by the Germans. They constructed five artillery batteries, 23 anti-aircraft batteries, 13 strongpoints, 12 resistance nests, three defence lines and emplaced over 30,000 mines on this small island.\n\nFort Tourgis was known to the Germans as Stutzpunkt Türkenburg or Strongpoint Turk's Castle. It had a three-gun 20mm Flak (anti-aircraft) battery, two 10.5 cm beach defence guns, two 7.5 cm Pak (anti-tank) guns, several searchlights and numerous machine guns. Note the ingenuity and quality of engineering design employed to fortify the former Victorian defences for 20th century warfare.\n\nThe growth of scrub over the fort since 1945 offers ideal habitat for invertebrates, small mammals, and birds. Kestrels use the musketry loops in the eastern wall to nest, with the fields and grassland outside as their hunting grounds. Stonechat and even the occasional Dartford warbler can be seen displaying on the shrubs that thrust up through the brambles.\n\nThis tunnel passes under the Victorian wall and enters the fort through the former magazine of Cambridge Battery. It enabled easy access between the fort and the gun bunkers outside, as well as providing a shorter route from the fort to Platte Saline and beyond.\n\nThe extent and concentration of concrete structures built by the occupying forces has through time become home to a wide range of wildlife. Ranging from barn swallows (which often nest in this tunnel) to a UK rarity, the Bloxworth snout moth, these spaces provide the ideal habitat, and a perfect place for those wishing to observe them.\n\nThis part of the fort, used for storing powder, shells and shot, would have supplied Cambridge Battery and was constructed to be secure and dry.\n\nWhen it was first built, Cambridge (No. 2) Battery at Fort Tourgis mounted eight smooth-bore 68- pounders and 32-pounders, firing spherical solid or explosive shot The powder charges would have been made up in the magazine and packed into sacks. These would have been taken out to the gun crews, and rammed into the gun barrels, followed by solid shot or explosive shell. The Germans also probably used the magazine as they constructed a very thick concrete wall for extra protection.\n\nBattery No. 2 was one of five in the Victorian fort. Situated at the fort's north-east corner, it housed 68-pounder and 32-pounder smooth-bore guns. These fired en barbette over walls topped with earthen ramparts. The guns were mounted on heavy timber platforms that rotated on iron pivots with small metal wheels. These ran on the semi-circular and circular racer rails that can still be clearly seen.\n\nThe Battery's defences included a long south-east facing loop-holed wall for musketry fire, together with a caponier projecting northwards to flank the fort's northern face (see plan).\n\nAlthough its purpose is not known for certain, it is likely that this bunker could have contained a small generator to power the adjacent 60 cm searchlight position. An alternative or additional use might have been as a personnel shelter. The bunker stands in a position once occupied by a Victorian heavy gun, which was mounted on a pivot and racer now buried under the concrete. Today, you may notice the presence of nesting sparrows, with up to three active nests being present in some years.\n\nDuring the First and Second World Wars, searchlights were an essential part of all defences to illuminate the sea and skies during night operations. Frequently they were used in conjunction with sound detectors and also radar. There were a total of at least 35 German searchlights on Alderney, 24 of them being 60 cm in diameter, with six of these being housed in bunkers unique to the island. The 60 cm unit mounted in this unusual emplacement was able to be moved into position on the rails that can still be seen in the floor, with the unit stored in the adjacent recessed area. A turntable allowed it to be moved into position from this recess to cover sea, beach attacks, and possibly aerial attacks, on the strongpoint. It had a range of over 5 kilometres.\n\nThe searchlight emplacement looks out both seaward and back into the fort itself. Behind you are the rough bramble, ivy clad walls and scrub cover that has grown over the fort in the past 70 years since the Germans surrendered. This now forms valuable habitat for species such as kestrel, buzzard, meadow pipit, stonechat and white-toothed shrew. Alderney's forts have become wildlife havens, and many flowering plants and ferns now make Tourgis their home.\n\nThe rapid re-colonisation of military sites, with the very different conditions and habitat they provide, is one of the reasons that Alderney has such a wildlife-rich countryside. What often looks like barren scrub is always full of life.\n\nFrom the searchlight emplacement there is a panoramic view of Clonque Bay and Platte Saline. Eastwards, you can see across to the Victorian Forts Doyle and Grosnez. The left, westward, side of the view takes in a good deal of Alderney's Ramsar site, an area of rocky coast, islets and seabed habitats protected under the Ramsar convention on wetlands of international importance.\n\nThe upwellings created by the tidal flows of Alderney's Swinge provide the nutrients that attract fish, and in turn seabirds, to our Living Islands, making Alderney the seabird centre of the English Channel. Look out for the pure white gannets with their black wingtips, often flying in formation; black shags drying their wings on rocks; the brown curlews with their long downward curved beaks, and the white little egrets stabbing fish in the rockpools beneath you.\n\nThis tunnel allowed easy access to the caponier from the battery. In Victorian times, there would have been no other access to the secure caponier from outside the fort. It would probably have been lit by oil lamps.\n\nFrom its modern internal appearance, the caponier appears to be from the era of the Second World War, but it has been ingeniously modified and strengthened, using a concrete lining to the original stone walls. This provided an emplacement for two German machine guns. Most of their bunkers were whitewashed inside, while larger ones were often lined with timber cladding on walls and floor. From the outside, the caponier is clearly part of the Victorian defences, and would have featured musketry loopholes to enable fire along the walls of the fort, protecting them from assault. Many forts of this and later periods, and also in some earlier ones, featured caponiers as part of their defences. Other examples can be seen in Alderney at Forts Clonque and, Raz – even on the east side of the Tourgis Citadel. They are an essential part of the defences of Fort Albert, a later and more modern design, where the deep ditch is defended by five caponiers.\n\nThis large space combined a machine gun position and a 7.5 cm Pak 40 mobile anti-tank gun, covering the wide arc of fire visible through the large embrasure. The towed Pak gun was able to traverse around a track, the position of which can still be seen in the concrete floor. This bunker of an unknown type was of Reinforced Field Order standard being constructed with concrete over one metre thick. A large, probably bullet-proof, door would have permitted easy access for the Pak gun. With the exception of the 10.5 cm Jäger bunker, none of the bunkers was gas-proofed.\n\nAfter June 1940, Alderney was occupied by German forces and heavily fortified. Fort Tourgis, with its strong defensive position on a hillside facing the sea, was an ideal site for defensive warfare. For example, the development of the tank and amphibious assault using landing craft required heavy beach defences and anti-tank guns. The first bunker as you enter the strongpoint housed both an anti-tank and a machine gun. There is a tunnel from the Victorian caponier, accessed from the 7.5 cm Pak bunker leading up to the Victorian battery. This caponier was lined with concrete by the Germans and mounted machine guns as well as having two west-facing weapon positions.\n\nFollowing extensive clearance and conservation work with volunteers supported by the States Works department, part of the northern defences of Fort Tourgis is now open to the public. Cambridge Battery (No.2) and its later German bunkers are an excellent example of how the original Victorian fortifications were adapted by German forces in the Second World War, when Alderney became one of the most heavily fortified sections of Hitler's Atlantic Wall.\n\nThis impressive large Jäger bunker housed a 10.5 cm K331 (f) beach defence gun. This particular type had both accommodation and a magazine and was only constructed in the Channel Islands. The 10.5 cm captured French gun would have covered the wide beach of Platte Saline which like many other beaches on the island was vulnerable to assault by landing craft and tanks.\n\nPlans to redevelop the fort exist, however, as of December 2012 an agreement on redevelopment had lapsed, and no construction work had been started. The derelict fort remains under the control of the States of Alderney.\n\n"}

{"id": "2213454", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2213454", "title": "Cumbia villera", "text": "Cumbia villera\n\nCumbia villera ( or ) (roughly translated as \"\"slum cumbia\"\", \"\"ghetto cumbia\"\" or \"\"shantytown cumbia\"\") is a subgenre of cumbia music originated in the slums of Argentina and popularized all over Latin America and the Latin communities abroad.\n\nLyrically, cumbia villera uses the vocabulary of the marginal and lower classes, like the Argentine \"lunfardo\" and \"lenguaje tumbero\" («gangsta language» or «thug language»), and deals with themes such as the everyday life in the \"villas miseria\" (slums), poverty and misery, the use of hard drugs, promiscuity and/or prostitution, night outs at \"boliches\" (discos and clubs) that play cumbia and other tropical music genres (such as the emblematic \"Tropitango\" venue in Pacheco), the football culture of the barra bravas, delinquency and clashes with the police and other forms of authority, antipathy towards politicians, authenticity as of being true \"villeros\" (the inhabitants of the \"villas\"), among other topics dealt in cumbia villera's lyrics.\n\nMusically, cumbia villera bases its sound in a heavy use of synthesizers, sound effects, keyboard voices, keytars, electronic drums and other elements from electric instruments. The cumbia villera's characteristic sound was born taking influences from Colombian and Peruvian cumbia, \"cumbia sonidera\" and \"cumbia santafesina\" in the realm of cumbia, and from reggae, ska, Argentine folklore, and electronic music in other music genres. Lastly, the creator of cumbia villera, Pablo Lescano, admitted that his lyrics were influenced by bands from Argentine punk rock like 2 Minutos and Argentine rock rolinga like Viejas Locas. This overview is not definitive, as time went on and the genre evolved, many bands started to explore different sounds, so new fusions were born, like \"cumbia rapera\" with Bajo Palabra (\"«Parole»\") mixing cumbia villera with hip hop, and \"tropipunk\" with Kumbia Queers mixing cumbia villera with punk.\n\nFor its characteristics, cumbia villera has been compared to gangsta rap, reggaeton, rock rolinga, raggamuffin, baile funk, and narcocorrido, among other music genres.\n\nCumbia villera was born in the late 1990s, amid an economic and social decline in Argentina. The introduction of neoliberal economics in Argentina in the early '90s gave a quick boost to the nation's economy but progressively marginalized large areas of the society, and by the late '90s, Argentina was in a total and implacable depression. Some of the most affected by this crisis were the worker and lower classes, and among them were the inhabitant and dwellers of the \"villas miseria\" (slums or shantytowns) in Buenos Aires and its metropolitan area, which favoured cumbia and other tropical music genres. However, through the '90s, Argentine cumbia bands such as Grupo Sombras (\"«Group Shadows»\") or Grupo Green didn't touch social issues and in fact their lyrics were limited to themes such as love or partying. It was in this situation that in 1999 the first cumbia villera band was born in the depths of \"Villa La Esperanza\" (\"«Villa The Hope»\"), a slum in San Fernando, Buenos Aires (north side of the Buenos Aires metropolitan area). Pablo Lescano, then keytarist from one of these cumbia bands, named Amar Azul (\"«To Love Blue»\", but a play on words with \"\"mar azul\"\", \"blue sea\"), started to pen new songs with more aggressive lyrics but his band rejected them, so he started saving from the royalties of the songs he penned for Amar Azul to buy instruments and equipment for producing an independent record, and created a new group with a different aesthetic, different lyrics and a different sound, Flor de Piedra (\"«Stone Flower»\", a name that also has a double-entendre, meaning roughly \"«hell of a rock»\"). However, Pablo Lescano decided not to play any instrument in the band because he stayed in Amar Azul, and he just limited himself to songwriting, composing and managing. Flor de Piedra released the first cumbia villera's album (\"\"La Vanda Más Loca\"\", \"«The Craziest Vand»\") by sending the master to a \"pirate\" broadcaster due to lack of interest in major record companies, and when the song used as the promotional single and first cumbia villera song \"\"Vos Sos Un Botón\"\" (\"«You're A Snitch»\") started to dominate the airwaves, the Leader Music label finally was interested in the band.\n\nThe records began to get heavy airplay, and soon the poor, the marginalized and the unemployed identified themselves with the new musical genre, and cumbia villera spread out to other large urban settlements, eventually rising to popularity in all Argentina. By 2000 there were dozens of cumbia villera bands starting, playing and recording their albums, one of these bands was in fact the second created by Pablo Lescano (this time definitely with the role of singer and keytarist), Damas Gratis (\"«Ladies Night»\" but also \"«Ladies For Free»\"), which he created after a motorbike accident that cost him his place in Amar Azul. New bands also went beyond the original foundations of Flor de Piedra and started to explore new sounds and themes, borrowing elements from rock (Los Gedes, \"«The Annoying»\") or classical (Mala Fama, \"«Bad Reputation»\"), and making the lyrics more socially conscious (Guachín, \"«Homie»\") or radically aggressive (Pibes Chorros, \"«Robber Boys»\"). The crisis that exploded in 2001 in Argentina strongly boosted cumbia villera's popularity and symbolized it for the posterity as an icon of an era in the history of Argentina. It was at this point that some of the finest albums in the history of cumbia villera were released, like \"\"100% Villero\"\" from Yerba Brava (2001) and \"\"Sólo Le Pido A Dios\"\" from Pibes Chorros (2002). The genre and its repercussions were widely discussed in the mainstream media, with debates in major newspapers, magazines, TV shows, and radio shows, and the phenomenon even reached the television with \"\"Tumberos\"\" (2002) and the cinema with \"\"El bonaerense\"\" (2002) and \"\"El polaquito\"\" (2003). Cumbia villera bands even started touring in neighbouring countries, North America and Europe, spreading the genre beyond the boundaries. This \"Argentine invasion\" greatly influenced the peoples from the Latin American countries where the bands toured, and soon there were cumbia villera bands formed in countries like Uruguay (La Clave), Paraguay (Los Rebeldes), Bolivia (Diego Soria), Chile (Buena Huacho), and Mexico (Cumbia Zero), contributing musically to the genre by using the different styles and influences from all the music genres of those nations, and contributing lyrically by using the vocabulary and slang used in the everyday life in their respective countries.\n\nBut trends in Argentine cumbia started to change by 2003, owing to the election of Argentine president Néstor Kirchner and the subsequent improvement in the nation's economy, some new measures in the Argentine music industry that affected the original cumbia villera's theme like pressure from the managers of the bands to quit singing controversial lyrics and censorship from broadcasters and the COMFER that forbade cumbia villera, though at what extent the censorship diminished cumbia villera's predominance or, on the contrary, further invigorated the musical genre, is discussed. The advocacy in the \"villas\" of Christian groups (both catholic and evangelical) also contributed. Other causes include changes in cumbia villera's bands like breakups (Guachín), switching singers and/or other members (Yerba Brava) and downfalls in drugs or other addictions (Damas Gratis), and the rise of new cumbia bands that differed in both sound and lyrics and even aesthetics like La Base and El Original that, for the most part, avoided controversial lyrics and instead sang about love, and named their style as \"\"cumbia base\"\" or other monikers to avoid the implicancies of being labeled as cumbia villera and subsequently being forbidden to play in venues or receive promotion, due to the censorship of COMFER.\n\nThrough the decade of the 2000s, cumbia villera continued to have a stronghold in the worker and poor communities all over Latin America, with even new bands being formed every year all over Latin America and continuing with the evolution of the genre, along with the usual constant tours around the Americas by the most representative bands like Damas Gratis and Pibes Chorros. As late as 2007, 30% of total sales in the Argentine music industry were still from cumbia villera records. But its predominance and influence in Latin America was somewhat decreased with the rise of reggaeton that started in the mid 2000s, and bachata and \"cumbia wachiturra\" in the 2010s. However, other authors have different opinions, like Pablo Semán, an Argentine sociologist, anthropologist, investigator in the CONICET and professor in the \"Instituto de Altos Estudios Sociales\" and the \"Escuela de Humanidades\" of the Universidad Nacional de San Martín, who also studied the phenomenon of rock \"rolinga\" and the decadence in Argentine culture in the '90s; Pablo Semán argues that cumbia villera is at last being vindicated in the decade of 2010s in circles of culture, philosophy and thought like universities and government secretaries as a genuine representative of speech by the forgotten peoples. The rising promotion in the 2010s of cumbia villera bands by mainstream rock and pop publications like the Rolling Stone of Argentina magazine, the organization of gigs and concerts of cumbia villera in venues were mainstream rock and pop bands use to play, outside the \"circuito de bailantas tropicales\" (the conglomerate of the tropical and cumbia discothèques), and lastly, the close collaboration and financial production of cumbia villera bands by mainstream musicians like Andrés Calamaro, Vicentico and Fidel Nadal, is also a phenomenon of the 2010s decade seen as a sign of good health in the genre. Nevertheless, cumbia villera remains in the memory of the collective imaginary as the most aggressive, the most defiant and the most socially conscious style of cumbia ever made, and one of the last genres made with true social commitment in the music in recent times.\n\nEver since the 1930s there has been a strong migration from the provinces (as well as from neighboring countries like Peru, Paraguay, and Bolivia) to the Greater Buenos Aires area where factory jobs beckoned. Migrants brought along their culture; the musical mix and the dynamic sounds of big-city life eventually gave birth to new styles. Notably, chamamé from Corrientes was cross-pollinated with Andean music and cuarteto from Córdoba province. Peruvian cumbia bands such as Los Mirlos were much in demand in the Buenos Aires suburbs. During the 1970s and 1980s, \"tropical\" was used as a catch-all term for this hybrid.\n\nIn the 1990s, commercial interests started promoting local cumbia numbers such as Amar Azul and Ráfaga with a more sophisticated image and an emphasis on attracting wider audiences. Traditional cumbia lovers looked for \"authentic\" acts, and many bands obliged by settling on a square cumbia beat, and writing lyrics that delved ever deeper into themes of crime and drug abuse. A pioneering act was \"Los Pibes Chorros\" (\"The Thieving Kids\"). Other bands in this vein are \"Yerba Brava\" (\"Tough Weed\", a play on words referring both to yerba mate and marijuana) and \"Damas Gratis\" (\"Ladies' Night\", literally \"Ladies for Free\"), widely acknowledged as the genre's leading act, that was started by Amar Azul's former keyboardist Pablo Lescano after a serious car accident made him reconsider the message he wanted to convey through music.\n\nThe pauperization of vast segments of the population due to the economic slowdown that started in 1998 enlarged the social substrate that sustained the genre. The term \"cumbia villera\" took hold in the media, and many bands were propelled into fame when emerging football stars from the shantytowns, such as Carlos Tevez, proclaimed their allegiance. When his schedule allows, Tevez is lead singer for Piola Vago (loose translation: \"savvy bum\").\n\nCumbia villera may be musically related to other local cumbia scenes such as Mexican cumbia sonidera and chicha from Peru. Reggaeton and hip-hop are less frequent influences.\n\nSome radio and TV shows had incorporated \"cumbia villera\" into their offerings, notably on weekend \"omnibus\" variety shows, where music runs the gamut from folklore to \"tropical\". The more provocative lyrics were seldom broadcast. Some of the bands gained audiences outside of Argentina, notably in Uruguay and Chile. Due to pressure from broadcasters and (allegedly) influence from Evangelical preachers active in the shantytowns, bands with less aggressive lyrics have enjoyed some success.\n\nWhilst traditional cumbia dancing bands often use a full brass section, cumbia villera recordings are often made at the lowest possible expense. As this usually entails the use of synthesizers, Argentine cumbia can be described, like Algerian raï, Romanian manele or Brazilian baile funk, as a \"low-fidelity, high-tech\" genre.\n\n"}

The Italian Unabomber was named by the international press in reference to Ted Kaczynski, the American Neo-Luddite terrorist and mail bomber known as the \"Unabomber\", but the Italian bomber made no political or economic demands. Over 20 explosive devices were attributed to the Italian Unabomber and resulted in numerous people receiving injuries including the removal of digits and limbs.\n\nOn August 28, 2006, Italian police raided the house of Elvo Zornitta, a 49-year-old engineer, who had been under surveillance for a year with assistance from the United States' Federal Bureau of Investigation. In January 2009, after years of investigations, the case was dropped after the prosecutors asked for its dismissal, for lack of evidence. Zornitta received €2,500,000 as compensation for his arrest and trial which included false evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
