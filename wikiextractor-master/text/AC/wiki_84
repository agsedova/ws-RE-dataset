Today, the bureau's operations involve improving child abuse prevention, foster care, and adoption. Historically, its work was much broader, as shown by the 1912 act which created and funded it:\n\nThe said bureau shall investigate and report to [the Department of Commerce and Labor] upon all matters pertaining to the welfare of children and child life among all classes of our people, and shall especially investigate the questions of infant mortality, the birth-rate, orphanage, juvenile courts, desertion, dangerous occupations, accidents and diseases of children, employment, legislation affecting children in the several states and territories.\n\nDuring the height of its influence, the Bureau was directed, managed, and staffed almost entirely by women—a rarity for any federal agency in the early 20th century. It was most influential in bringing the methods of social research and the ideas of maternalist reformers to bear on federal government policy.\n\nNew Deal legislation, including the Fair Labor Standards Act and Aid to Dependent Children programs, incorporated many reforms that the Children's Bureau and its network of grassroots women's organizations had supported for years. By the time the Children's Bureau was folded into the Social Security Administration in 1946, it began to assume more of its modern role.\n\nMost accounts of the Children's Bureau's origins point to three people, Lillian Wald, Edward Thomas Devine, and Florence Kelley, who began to discuss the idea around 1903. Their proposal (with colleagues) to President Theodore Roosevelt in 1905 reflected the Progressive Era's generally heightened concern for social welfare issues, as well as the influence of the Settlement movement, of which all three were members.\nAlso in 1905, the recently formed National Child Labor Committee (NCLC) agreed to make the establishment of a federal children's bureau its primary legislative goal. The NCLC's effort was supported by women's groups such as the National Consumers League, the General Federation of Women's Clubs, the National Congress of Mothers, and the Daughters of the American Revolution. The proposal also was endorsed by attendees of the first White House Conference on Children and Youth in 1909.\n\nThe bill establishing the Children's Bureau was passed in 1912 following a lengthy legislative effort, and it was signed by President William Howard Taft on April 9 of that year. The Children's Bureau became the first national government office in the world that focused solely on the well-being of children and their mothers.\n\nTaft appointed Julia Lathrop as the first head of the Bureau. Lathrop, a noted maternalist reformer also active in the Settlement Movement, was the first woman ever to head a government agency in the United States.\n\nAt its founding, the bureau was part of the Department of Commerce and Labor; when the two departments' functions were separated in 1913, it became part of the Department of Labor.\n\nThe Children's Bureau's first efforts focused on decreasing infant mortality by determining \"how many\" babies were dying, through expanded birth registration efforts, and understanding \"why\" so many babies died before their first birthday. The Bureau completed birth registration campaigns and conducted infant mortality studies in 10 cities between 1914 and 1921. These studies revealed strong connections between poverty and infant deaths.\n\nThe Bureau's commitment to fighting infant mortality resonated with the proliferation of \"baby-saving\" campaigns throughout the country at this time. The Bureau endorsed activities such as prenatal care, infant health clinics, visiting nurses, public sanitation, certified milk stations, and education of mothers. It proclaimed a \"Children's Year\" beginning April 6, 1918, to protect children from shortages of milk, food, and public health nurses during World War I. As part of this effort, volunteers weighed and measured millions of children, resulting in the publication of the nation's first age, height, and weight standards.\n\nIn its first few years, the Children's Bureau published several pamphlets about prenatal, infant, and child care. These booklets were soon in high demand. By 1929, the Bureau estimated that the information in its pamphlets had benefited one-half of all U.S. babies.\n\nIn 1914 Emma Octavia Lundberg became the first Director of the Social Services Division of the Children's Bureau.\n\nChild labor became a focus of the Children's Bureau's efforts beginning around 1915. Between 1915 and 1930, the Bureau published 31 studies examining children's working conditions by visiting child laborers in their homes and workplaces. These studies helped to reveal the prevalence and nature of child labor in the United States.\n\nIn 1916, Congress passed the Keating-Owen Act, which discouraged child labor. Congress assigned the Children's Bureau the responsibilities of administering and enforcing this law. Chief Lathrop hired noted child-labor reformer Grace Abbott to lead the Bureau's newly created Child Labor Division in April 1917; however, the law was short-lived. The Supreme Court of the United States ruled it unconstitutional in June 1918.\n\nIn August 1921, Lathrop stepped down as Chief, and Grace Abbott was appointed to succeed her.\n\nThe Children's Bureau played a major role in the passage and administration of the Sheppard–Towner Act. This law, passed in 1921, authorized the first federal grants-in-aid for state-level children's health programs. Projects in most states included some or all of the following:\n\n\nThe program ended in 1929, having helped an estimated 4 million infants and preschool children and approximately 700,000 pregnant women.\n\nMaternal and infant care and child labor were the Bureau's primary focus during its first two decades. However, other topics of research included juvenile delinquency, mother's aid, illegitimacy, foster care, and children's diseases. Notably:\n\n\nDuring the early years of the Great Depression, under President Herbert Hoover, the Children's Bureau helped with government efforts to document families' needs and local relief efforts. When Congress established the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA) in May 1933, the Children's Bureau helped to collect data for the agency to determine how the appropriations would be spent. The Bureau also worked with the FERA to establish the Child Health Recovery Program, providing emergency food and medical care to children in need.\n\nIn December 1934, Katherine Lenroot succeeded Abbott as Chief of the Bureau. She held this position until 1952. Lenroot, Martha May Eliot, and Grace Abbott worked together to create the child-focused sections of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Social Security bill:\n\n\nWhen the Social Security Act was signed in 1935, the Children's Bureau was granted authority to administer the last three of these programs. (Aid to Dependent Children was administered by the newly established Social Security Board.) The Bureau grew from distributing $337,371 in 1930 to dispensing nearly $11 million in grants by the end of the decade; its staff grew from 143 to more than 400.\n\nIn the meantime, the Children's Bureau remained active in the campaign against child labor. In 1933, the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) opened the door for the Bureau to establish industry-specific child labor codes and the first federal minimum age for full-time employment. The NIRA was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in May 1935. Many of its provisions, however, were recreated in the Fair Labor Standards Act passed three years later.\n\nThroughout World War II, the Children's Bureau continued to promote the well-being of U.S. children through activities such as developing standards for day care for children of working mothers and a campaign to focus attention on children's physical and emotional needs during the war. Meanwhile, the Bureau worked with the U.S. Committee for the Care of European Children to maintain a central register of unaccompanied refugee children arriving in the United States, to oversee their placement with agencies and foster families, and to establish standards for their care.\n\nThe Children's Bureau's wartime Emergency Maternity and Infant Care (EMIC) program provided for medical, hospital, and nursing care for wives and babies of men in the four lowest pay grades of the Armed Forces. At the time, EMIC was the largest federally funded medical care program ever undertaken in the United States, serving approximately 1.5 million women and babies between 1943 and 1949.\n\nIn 1946, the Children's Bureau was folded into the Social Security Administration as part of a massive postwar reorganization of the federal government. In this reorganization, the Bureau lost authority over all labor-related programs. On September 4, 1951, Martha May Eliot became the Bureau's fourth Chief.\n\nIn 1952, the Bureau formed the Special Juvenile Delinquency Project with foundations and other private partners interested in improving the prevention and treatment of delinquency. The Project sponsored public meetings and collaborated on a series of practice guides and professional standards. When the project ended in 1955, the Bureau's work in this area continued through a newly created Division of Juvenile Delinquency Service.\n\nThe Children's Bureau's grant-in-aid programs grew significantly in the decade following World War II:\n\n\nPresident Dwight D. Eisenhower named Katherine Oettinger the fifth Chief of the Children's Bureau on May 17, 1957. Oettinger's tenure as Chief (1957–1968) reflected a growing emphasis on preserving and strengthening families. Under her direction, the Bureau also advocated for greater protection for all parties in an adoption.\n\nIt was during this period that the Bureau's first research and demonstration grants in child welfare were authorized. Early topics included methods for meeting the needs of disadvantaged preschool children and their families (a precursor to the Head Start Program), selection of foster parents, and the well-being of adopted children and their families. In 1962, amendments to the Social Security Act authorized the Children's Bureau to make its first child welfare training grants to institutions of higher education.\n\nThe focus on maternal and infant health programs continued throughout the 1960s. The Children's Bureau provided early national leadership in the diagnosis and treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU) to prevent mental retardation. Other special health care projects during this period included prosthetics research, epilepsy treatment, and dissemination of vaccines for polio and other childhood diseases.\n\nThe Children's Bureau also contributed to a growing awareness of child abuse, or \"battered child syndrome\" as it was called in the early 1960s. The Bureau held meetings with experts and drafted a model statute that states could use to require doctors and hospitals to report suspected abuse. All states enacted some form of this law by the end of 1967. The Bureau also funded grants to research causes of child abuse and effective prevention methods.\n\nIn January 1963, the Children's Bureau was moved from the Social Security Administration to the newly created Welfare Administration, reflecting a growing emphasis on coordination between child welfare services and the ADC program.\n\nIn keeping with President Lyndon B. Johnson's priorities, the Bureau's work on juvenile delinquency began to evolve into a focus on prevention and positive youth development. A Youth Services Unit was created in 1966 to encourage more proactive services to help youth transition successfully into adulthood. At the same time, the Children's Bureau continued to study ways to improve the effectiveness of juvenile court systems. In 1967, the Bureau released a revised version of its \"Standards for Juvenile and Family Courts\". These standards, emphasizing the importance of due process for youth offenders, were cited in the groundbreaking \"in re Gault\" decision that year.\n\nOn September 17, 1969, the Children's Bureau was moved to a new Office of Child Development (OCD) within the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare's Office of the Secretary. At that time, many of the Bureau's responsibilities were assigned to other areas of the federal government. All health programs, including maternal and child health services, crippled children's services, maternity and infant care projects, and health research, were permanently relocated to the Public Health Service within the Health Services and Mental Health Administration. Today, these programs still exist within the Maternal and Child Health Bureau, Health Resources and Services Administration, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Children's Bureau continued to administer research but was no longer responsible for any direct service programs, including those related to juvenile delinquency, child welfare, or families in the AFDC program. This reorganization essentially narrowed the Bureau's focus to three areas: increasing the number of foster families, helping to find permanent families for children waiting for adoption, and preventing and addressing child abuse and neglect.\n\nIn response to rising numbers of children in foster care, Children's Bureau grants during the 1970s investigated in-home services to strengthen families, family-centered casework, permanency planning, family reunification, the needs of children living with relatives, and how to remove barriers to adoption for children with special needs. The Bureau also examined the impact of workforce issues on the foster care system and supported a growing foster parents' movement through conferences and grants.\n\nIn adoption policy, the Children's Bureau's focus shifted from finding children for families to finding parents for children. Increased attention was paid to the growing number of hard-to-place children, including those from minority groups, older children, children with disabilities, and sibling groups. The Bureau supported exploration of nontraditional adoption arrangements, such as cross-cultural, transracial, single-parent, and subsidized adoption.\n\nPassage of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) of 1974 created a National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect (NCCAN) within the Children's Bureau. NCCAN centralized and coordinated the Bureau's growing focus on more effective child abuse prevention, research, state reporting laws, and systems.\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter signed the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act on June 17, 1980. This landmark law assigned the Children's Bureau additional responsibilities, including reporting to Congress on foster care placements, collecting and publishing data on foster care and adoption, and conducting regular audits of state child welfare programs.\n\nDuring President Ronald Reagan's administration, there was a continued emphasis on family-based services, special needs adoption, and child abuse prevention. Some notable examples of the Bureau's projects during the 1980s include proclamations of the first National Child Abuse Prevention Month and National Adoption Week, establishment of a National Adoption Information Clearinghouse, and creation of the Children's Justice Act program to help states improve their handling of child abuse cases, with a particular emphasis on child sexual abuse.\n\nBoth of the Children's Bureau's present-day data collection systems, the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS) and the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS), were developed during this period. Enhanced data collection resulted in a deeper understanding of the families and children affected by child abuse and neglect, foster care, and adoption. This led to legislative and policy changes during the late 1980s and early 1990s, including the establishment of a federal program to support independent living services for youth aging out of the foster care system without permanent families. In response to the HIV and crack cocaine epidemics, Congress created the Abandoned Infants Assistance program in 1988.\n\nOn April 15, 1991, today's Administration for Children and Families was created within the Department of Health and Human Services, encompassing ACYF and the Children's Bureau. The same year, NCCAN was moved out from within the Children's Bureau and became a separate entity within ACYF.\n\nChiefs during this period included:\n\nPresident Bill Clinton signed the Family Preservation and Support Services Program Act on August 10, 1993, as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-66). The family preservation program, administered by the Children's Bureau, authorized services to help families in crisis (such as respite care and intensive in-home assistance), as well as other forms of family support and family reunification. P.L. 103-66 also established the Court Improvement Program, through which the Children's Bureau provides grants to improve state courts' handling of child welfare cases, and provided additional funds for states to improve their child welfare data collection systems.\n\nGrowing awareness of the problem of child abuse and neglect, and particularly child deaths, resulted in many enhancements to prevention, investigation, and prosecution efforts. In 1996, the Children's Bureau created a new program, the Community-Based Family Resource and Support grants, to encourage public and private child abuse prevention and treatment programs to work together more effectively.\n\nIn 1995, the Children's Bureau convened an Adoption Program Network to provide input on a new National Adoption Strategic Plan. Around the same time, President Clinton encouraged HHS to develop a plan for doubling the number of adoptions and permanent placements from foster care during the next five years. HHS responded by issuing a report, with the Bureau's assistance, that outlined a series of policy- and practice-related steps toward achieving this goal. These recommendations became the framework for the Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA, P.L. 105-89), signed by President Clinton on November 19, 1997. The Children's Bureau was tasked with helping states bring their laws and policies into compliance with this new federal law, which focused on timely permanence, child well-being, and increased accountability of child welfare systems.\n\nASFA also required HHS to establish outcome measures to track State performance in protecting children. These measures were used in a series of annual reports on national outcomes for child welfare services, first published in 2000. The Child and Family Services Reviews (CFSRs), federal reviews of state child welfare systems based on these outcome measures, began in 2001. Findings from the first round of CFSRs provided more detailed information about states' strengths and needs, enabling the Bureau to create technical assistance and data collection systems more directly focused on areas of greatest need. Some examples include:\n\n\nIn 2003, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the first Presidential Proclamation for Child Abuse Prevention Month, OCAN launched a yearlong National Child Abuse Prevention Initiative. Since then, support for child abuse prevention efforts has continued to expand, due in part to growing evidence that home visitation programs can effectively reduce maltreatment and improve outcomes for pregnant mothers and families with young children. In 2011, another child abuse prevention initiative kicked off at the Bureau's first Network for Action meeting.\n\nMore recent Children's Bureau initiatives have included the following:\n\n\nOn April 9, 2012, the Children's Bureau marked its 100th anniversary with a ceremony at the Hubert H. Humphrey Building in Washington, DC. HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, Acting Assistant Secretary for Children and Families George Sheldon, and Acting Associate Commissioner Joe Bock were among the speakers at the event. Former ACYF Commissioner Carol Wilson Spigner (Carol Williams) was given a Children's Bureau Centennial Award for her \"extraordinary vision and leadership in the field of child welfare services.\"\n\nIn its early years, the Children's Bureau published voluminously on many topics related to children's health and well-being, and it distributed its publications very widely. A full bibliography is impossible here, but an OpenLibrary search by author gives some sense of the range of topics.\n\nSome of the Bureau's significant recent publications include the following:\n\n\n\n"}

He later became a successful operatic tenor in the 1960s, making appearances with the Opera Company of Boston, the New York City Opera, and the American National Opera Company.\n\nRall was born in Kansas City, Missouri and raised in Seattle. As a child he had a crossed eye which made it hard for him to read books, so his mother enrolled him in dancing classes. In his early years he performed a dance and acrobatic vaudeville act in Seattle theaters and attempted small acting roles.\n\nHis family moved to Los Angeles in the 1940s, and Rall began to appear in small movie roles. His first film appearance was a short MGM film called \"Vendetta.\" He began taking tap dancing lessons and became a member of the jitterbugging Jivin' Jacks and Jills at Universal Studios.\n\nRall joined Donald O'Connor, Peggy Ryan and Shirley Mills in several light wartime Andrews Sisters vehicles including \"Give Out, Sisters\" (1942) \"Get Hep to Love\" (1942) \"Mister Big\", and others. He appeared in the films \"The North Star\" and \"Song of Russia\" (1944).\n\nRall took ballet lessons and danced in classical and Broadway shows, including \"Milk and Honey\", \"Call Me Madam\" and \"Cry for Us All\". Jerry Herman said of Rall in \"Milk and Honey\": \"[Donald] [Saddler] did extraordinary choreography for Tommy Rall, who was suddenly so admired by the audience that [the producer] put his name on the marquee under the three stars. It was very, very earned by him. He was a terrific singer and dancer.\"\n\nHe is best known for his acrobatic dancing in several classic musical films of the 1950s, including \"Kiss Me, Kate\" as \"Bill\" (1953), \"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers\" as \"Frank\" (1954), \"Invitation to the Dance\" (1956),\n\"Merry Andrew\" as \"Giacomo Gallini\" (1958), and \"My Sister Eileen\" as \"Chick\" (1955).\n\nRall's film career waned as movie musicals went into decline. He had a role in the movie \"Funny Girl\", as \"The Prince\" in a parody of the ballet \"Swan Lake\". On Broadway he danced to acclaim as \"Johnny\" in Marc Blitzstein and Joseph Stein's 1959 musical \"Juno\" (based on Seán O'Casey's play \"Juno and the Paycock\"). Ken Mandelbaum wrote: \"DeMille provided two fine ballets: her second act 'Johnny' in which Tommy Rall danced out Johnny's emotions...was the evening's highlight.\"\n\nRall was highly respected by his contemporaries—including dance greats Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor—with the latter describing Rall as one of the “greatest dancers living...above Astaire and Kelly.”\n\nRall was briefly married to his \"Juno\" co-star, Monte Amundsen. He is now married to former ballerina Karel Shimoff.\n\nIn 2007, a dance instructor by the name of Fredric Brame was found to have been posing as Tommy Rall since the late 1960s. His biographies, resumes, and playbills all support that Brame was Fredric Brame aka Tommy Rall by the credits listed. When Rall found out about the masquerade decades later, through a friend of the family, Rall contacted the Montgomery County (Texas) Sheriff's office. No legal action was taken against Brame since he technically did not commit a crime. Rall only wanted Brame to stop taking credit for his work and if he continued or did it again a lawsuit would be filed.\n\nSources: TCM; MasterWorks Broadway\n\nFeatures:\nShort Subjects:\n\nSource: MasterWorksBroadway; Internet Broadway Database\n\n\n\n(vidéo Danse Routine - Tommy Rall & Ann Miller -Kiss me Kate film sur youtube.com:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-P84-_7kCiQ\n"}
{"id": "2162079", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2162079", "title": "Wið færstice", "text": "Wið færstice\n\n\"Wið færstice\" is an Old English medical text surviving in the collection known now as \"Lacnunga\" in the British Library. \"Wið færstice\" means 'against a sudden/violent stabbing pain'; and according to Felix Grendon, whose collection of Anglo-Saxon charms appeared in the Journal of American Folklore in 1908, “the charm is intended to cure a sudden twinge or stitch, possibly rheumatism that can be due to being shot by witches, elves, and other spirits that fly through the air.” Scholars have often sought to identify this as rheumatism, but other possibilities should not be excluded. The remedy describes how to make a salve, but its main interest lies in the unique charm which follows. This describes how the \"færstice\" has been caused by the projectiles of 'mighty women' (\"ða mihtigan wif\"), whom the healer will combat. The charm also mentions elves, believed responsible for elfshot, and provides the only attestation outside personal names of the Old English form of the name of the old Germanic gods, known as the Æsir in Norse mythology.\n\nAs with many old Anglo-Saxon charms, it is presumed that physical gestures were intended to accompany the recitation of the text. In this case, the \"Wið færstice\" is intended to be accompanied by boiling feverfew, red nettle grown in grain, and plantain, then boiling it all in a bowl of butter. A knife is dipped into the potion and then rubbed against the source of pain. Despite the popular use of the aforementioned herbs in forms of remedial healing, it is important to note that the usage of these plants may have been more symbolic than practical. Many old Anglo-Saxon charms draw upon the symbolism of both pagan traditions as well as ancient Christian traditions, and the usage of plants in the texts were likely related to these religious references.\n\nThe first seventeen lines of the \"Wið færstice\" have been referred to as its \"epic introduction\".\nHowell D. Chickering Junior expressed the view that there \"probably is no epic or mythic narrative\" behind this introductory section, instead arguing that it should be seen as \"a dramatic verbal performance\". As edited and translated by Alaric Hall, the text runs:\n\nThe age of \"Wið færstice\" has been hard to judge.\nConsidering all of the available evidence, Medieval literature specialist Alaric Hall deemed it probable that the charm was a \"cultural artefact\" from the late tenth century.\n\nEarly examinations of the Anglo-Saxon poetic charms were largely focused on determining which elements within them derived from the pre-Christian belief systems of the Anglo-Saxons. Accordingly, attention was paid to \"Wið færstice\", which was deemed to be \"one of the three or four charms apparently richest in pagan references.\" With the exception of the closing benediction, the charm lacks any obvious Christian references, with Jolly accordingly believing that from modern understandings of Christianity, it would seem \"overwhelmingly \"not\" Christian\". She however cautioned against viewing it as either non-Christian on the one hand, or as pagan on the other. She highlighted that the presumed pagan elements within it all reflected \"areligious folklore, transferable from one religious tradition to another\", while it was produced by people living in Late Anglo-Saxon England who would have considered themselves to be Christian and who felt no need to highly Christianise it.\n\nIt is not known what medical symptom the Old English term \"færstice\" refers to in this charm. Several scholars to have studied the charm, such as Godfrid Storms and Howell D. Chickering Jr., expressed the view that it referred to rheumatism.\nAlthough noting that prior interpretations of the charm had suggested that the \"færstice\" referred to rheumatism or lumbago, the Anglo-Saxonist Stephen Pollington opined that there were \"no compelling reasons\" to accept either explanation, instead expressing the view that it should be regarded as a reference to \"any sharp, unexpected pain\".\n\nHall was of the view that \"Wið færstice\" \"constructs a strong distinction between in-group (the patient and healer) and harmful out-group (the supernatural beings).\"\n\nHall expressed the view that the poem \"provides a key to interpreting the cultural significance of \"ælfe\" in medieval texts\".\nGiven his argument that in \"earlier Anglo-Saxon beliefs\", \"ælfe\" were \"probably primarily or only male\", he considered it interesting that in this charm they are cited alongside the female \"hægtessan\".\n\nHall identified an earlier parallel in Aldhelm's poetic \"Carmen de virginitate\", specifically the passage in lines 2635–42 in which he describes Allecto, one of the \"Furiae\" of Classical mythology. In this passage, Allecto is described as bringing \"iron-tipped spears to battle, which would cause jagged wounds to holy souls\". Hall noted that this use of iron-tipped spears could not have been adopted straight from Classical sources, where Allecto and the Furies cause harm using snakes rather than spears. Rather, he compared the use of the Furies' spears to the spears of the \"hægtesse\" in \"Wið færstice\", bolstering this connection by noting that in the eighth century Third Cleopatra Glossary, the Latin word \"furiarum\" is given the Old English gloss of \"hægtessa\".\n\nHall also argued that there was a \"remarkable parallel\" between \"Wið færstice\" and the accounts of magical practices provided by Isobel Gowdie, a Scottish woman accused of witchcraft in 1662, during her confessions. Gowdie claimed that she rode through the air on straw with her fellow witches, firing \"elf-arrows\" at her victims; these had been acquired from the Devil, who had been aided in their creation by \"Elf-boyes\". Hall stated that this exhibited a general similarity to the account provided in \"Wið færstice\". He also thought there were parallels between the two accounts in terms of their use of smiths; in both, one smith (the Devil in Gowdie's account) is part of a wider group of smiths.\nWhile acknowledging \"the great gap of time\" – lasting around seven centuries – between the two accounts, Hall noted that \"charm-texts and related traditions\" could be transmitted across this gap of time, citing the example of the Second Merseburg Charm as an example.\n\n"}

He played in Major League Baseball from to for the Cleveland Indians, New York Yankees and Atlanta Braves. He served as a coach for the Yankees, St. Louis Cardinals, New York Mets, Cincinnati Reds, and Seattle Mariners.\n\nChambliss won the American League Rookie of the Year Award with the Indians in 1971. He was an All-Star with the Yankees in 1976, the same year he hit the series-winning home run in the 1976 American League Championship Series. He was a member of the Yankees' 1977 and 1978 World Series championship teams, both against the Los Angeles Dodgers, and won the Gold Glove Award in 1978. Chambliss went on to win four more World Series championships as the hitting coach for the Yankees in 1996, 1998, 1999, and 2000.\n\nChambliss was born in Dayton, Ohio, on December 26, 1948. He was the third of four sons born to Carroll and Christene Chambliss. His father was a chaplain in the United States Navy, leading the family to relocate many times during Chris' childhood. They settled in Oceanside, California, where Chris attended high school. Chris and his brothers all played baseball on the Oceanside High School baseball team.\n\nChambliss enrolled at MiraCosta College, a junior college, where he played college baseball. Despite being selected in the Major League Baseball (MLB) Drafts of 1967 and 1968 by the Cincinnati Reds, he opted not to sign with the Reds on either occasion. He transferred to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he continued his college baseball career with the UCLA Bruins baseball team in 1969. That season, he led the Bruins with 15 home runs and 45 runs batted in. During the summer, he played collegiate summer baseball for the Anchorage Glacier Pilots of the Alaska Baseball League, which won the National Baseball Congress (NBC) championship. Chambliss had a .583 batting average in the NBC tournament and was named the tournament's Most Valuable Player.\n\nThe Cleveland Indians selected Chambliss with the first overall pick in the January 1970 Major League Baseball Draft. The Indians assigned him to the Wichita Aeros of the Class AAA American Association, their most advanced minor league baseball affiliate. With the Aeros, Chambliss batted .342, which led the league.\n\nWith Ken Harrelson serving as the Indians' first baseman, the Indians had Chambliss play in the outfield for Wichita in 1971, in order to have both players in their lineup at the same time. He debuted in the majors in 1971, and was named AL Rookie of the Year. Chambliss played first base and was known as a great clutch hitter throughout his career.\n\nChambliss was traded along with Dick Tidrow and Cecil Upshaw from the Indians to the New York Yankees for Fritz Peterson, Steve Kline, Fred Beene and Tom Buskey on April 26, 1974. The Yankees were criticized for giving away four pitchers as opposed to the two it got in return and a failure to land a starting second baseman.\n\nChris Chambliss was once quoted as saying, \"If you're not having fun [in baseball], you miss the point of everything.\"\n\nChambliss appeared in the 1976 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.\n\nIn the deciding Game 5 of the 1976 American League Championship Series against the Kansas City Royals, Chambliss hit Mark Littell's first pitch in the bottom of the ninth inning to right field for a game-winning home run, giving the Yankees their first pennant since 1964. \n\nChambliss was the hitting star of the 1976 ALCS, as he also hit a two-run homer in Game 3 to help the Yankees win that game 5–3. He hit an ALCS record .524 (11-for-21) with 2 home runs and eight RBIs. In the 1976 World Series against the Cincinnati Reds, Chambliss hit .313 (5-for-16) with one RBI.\n\nChambliss played three more seasons with the Yankees, helping lead the Yankees to the 1977 World Series title–their first since 1962–and winning a Gold Glove for his fielding prowess in 1978.\n\nImmediately after the walk-off home run, thousands of fans stormed the Yankee Stadium field to celebrate. Chambliss was mobbed on the basepaths and did not make an attempt to touch home plate. Instead, he ran straight toward the dugout and the safety of the Yankee clubhouse. Chambliss was then asked by Graig Nettles if he had touched home, and responded that he had not because too many people were in the way. Nettles then told him that home plate umpire Art Frantz was waiting for him to touch home so that the home run could be ruled official. He was then escorted back out onto the field to touch home, but the plate had been stolen, so he touched the area where the plate had been.\n\nSaid Chambliss:\n\n\"I just kind of reacted like I always did. I wasn't trying to hit a home run. Sometimes when you react to a high fastball it works out that way. Then, when I was running around the bases, fans were coming at me from everywhere, grabbing me, pounding me on the back. I was just trying to get around the bases and into the dugout---I ran at least one guy over---but I never made it to home plate. Later, after I got to the clubhouse, [Graig] Nettles said I should return to the field and touch home plate, just to make it official. But when we got back out there, home plate and all the other bases were gone, stripped from their moorings and confiscated by the delirious Yankee fans.\"\n\nKansas City manager Whitey Herzog could have appealed the play, as Major League rules state that a player must touch all bases on any hit or when running the bases. However, the mayhem on the field made this task impossible, and given the magnitude of the game, Herzog would have never tried to have it restarted or protested due to a technicality. In any event, the umpires had already decided to let the run count given the circumstances of the situation.\n\nAs a result of this incident, Major League Baseball changed the rules to allow the umpire to award any base runner or batter a run when he cannot reach the plate due to fans rushing the field. This had the effect of codifying the decision made by the umpires in Game 5.\nAfter the 1979 season, the Yankees traded Chambliss to the Toronto Blue Jays with Damaso Garcia and Paul Mirabella for Rick Cerone, Tom Underwood, and Ted Wilborn. The Yankees hoped that Cerone would replace Thurman Munson as their starting catcher. Later that offseason, the Blue Jays traded Chambliss with Luis Gómez to the Atlanta Braves for prospects Barry Bonnell, Joey McLaughlin, and Pat Rockett.\n\nHe then moved on to Atlanta from 1980 through 1986. He had one at-bat with the Yankees in 1988 and struck out. (According to Lou Piniella, this at-bat earned him about $20,000, since he had to be paid the minimum player salary for the season after he was activated for that at-bat.) He retired with a career .279 batting average and 185 home runs. After his playing days ended, Chambliss became a hitting instructor for several teams and was talked about as a possible managerial candidate.\n\nIn 1989, Chambliss became the manager for the Double-A London Tigers of the Eastern League, an affiliate of the Detroit Tigers. The London Tigers won the Eastern League title in 1990, playing out of Labatt Park. That same year Chambliss was named Minor League Manager of the Year by \"The Sporting News\".\n\nChambliss was also a hitting coach with the Yankees, and has the distinction of being one of two men who wore a Yankees uniform (player or coach) during each of the Yankees' last six World Series Championship seasons prior to 2009 (1977, 1978, 1996, 1998, 1999, and 2000)—the other is former New York Mets manager Willie Randolph. Chambliss was also the hitting coach for the St. Louis Cardinals, New York Mets and Cincinnati Reds.\n\nFor many years, Chambliss was a leading candidate to manage a major league team. He was considered for manager of the Chicago White Sox in 1991, the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1996, the New York Mets in 1999, the Dodgers and Arizona Diamondbacks in 2000, and the Mets again in 2002.\n\nChambliss was the manager of the Triple A Charlotte Knights prior to joining the Seattle Mariners in November 2010 as hitting coach. At the conclusion of the 2012 season, the Mariners announced that Chambliss would not be returning as their hitting coach in 2013.\n\nChambliss' cousin is former NBA player Jo Jo White.\n\nHis son Russell is a graduate of Washington University in St. Louis, and currently hitting coach with the Peoria Chiefs.\n\n\n"}

It is otherwise known as Hau Hoi Wan () in Hong Kong, and Shenzhen Bay () in Mainland China.\n\nThe local Cantonese name of the bay is Hau Hoi Wan (后海灣), which means the \"back (sea) bay\". It is opposite to another bay, Tsin Hoi Wan (), which means \"front (sea) bay\", on the other side of Nantau Peninsula. The Chinese character 后 (Hau, lit. queen) in 后海灣 is the homonym of 後 (Hau, lit. back), and also its simplified character. Some attribute the character 后 (Hau) to the goddess of mercy and sea, Tin Hau (天后).\n\nThe name of Shenzhen Bay came much later, at least after the establishment of Shenzhen Special Economic Zone in 1980. The name became more notable after a hotel was named Shenzhen Bay. While the government of China uses the name widely, the people and government in Hong Kong continue to use the official name (后海灣).\n\nAs the bay is largely enclosed by land, fresh water from the surrounding land enters the bay from a shallow shore of wetland. The margin of fresh water and salt water forms a valuable habitat for a wide variety of life.\n\nThe bay's northern shore used to be lined with marshes. As Shenzhen began to develop into a major urban centre, the northern shoreline was reclaimed to provide land for buildings. Some departments had tried to preserve the endangered environment but mistakenly introduced foreign species of mangrove, which threatened their indigenous counterparts.\n\nThe marshes remain largely intact along the southern part of the bay, which is under Hong Kong's jurisdiction. Mai Po is an important habitat for migrating birds in the area. Pools of former fish farms is another attraction to birds.\n\nThe bay is rich in fish and oysters. Lau Fau Shan is particularly famous for oysters in Hong Kong. From Lau Fau Shan to Mai Po, the villagers made use of the special environment's pools to cultivate fishes. A by-product of this cultivation, greasyback shrimp (基圍蝦), is also a delicacy in Hong Kong.\n\nBefore 1949, Chinese people were free to travel between Hong Kong and mainland China. In order to halt a large influx of refugees from mainland China, the Hong Kong Government established border control and compulsory registration of Hong Kong residents.\n\nAs a result, it was harder to migrate to Hong Kong than before and thus many crossed the border illegally. Deep Bay became the main access for illegal immigrants because border controls were harder to enforce at sea. It was relatively easy to cross the bay and there were major roads to the urban centres of Hong Kong. The rural town of Lau Fau Shan was the major landing point.\n\n"}

He was also Solicitor General for Scotland on three occasions, and was Dean of the Faculty of Advocates.\n\nAsher was born at Inveravon, Banffshire, on 27 January 1834. He was the third son of William Asher the parish minister of Inveravon and his wife, Katherine Forbes Gordon. He was educated at Elgin Academy and both King's College, Aberdeen and Edinburgh University. He was awarded honorary degrees of LL.D. by Aberdeen and Edinburgh Universities in 1891.\n\nAsher was admitted to the Scottish Bar, the Faculty of Advocates in 1861. He was appointed an Advocate Depute in 1870. At this time he was living at 31 Heriot Row, a huge Georgian townhouse in Edinburgh's Second New town.\n\nIn December 1881 he took silk, becoming a Queen's Counsel (QC). In 1895, he was unanimously chosen as Dean of the Faculty of Advocates, following the resignation of Charles Pearson when he was appointed as Lord Advocate.\n\nAt the general election of 1880 Asher was unsuccessful as Liberal candidate for the universities of Glasgow and Aberdeen. In 1881, following the resignation of M. E. Grant Duff from the Elgin Burghs constituency, Asher was chosen to represent the Liberal Party at the 1881 Elgin Burghs by-election. He was elected unopposed on 13 July. He immediately took office in the Liberal Government of William Gladstone as Solicitor General for Scotland, serving until 1885. He was elected unopposed at the General Election 1885, at a by-election on 12 February 1886 after re-acceptance of office as Solicitor General for Scotland and again at the General Election 1886. His second spell as Solicitor General being cut short when the Liberals lost power. He stood again at the 1892 United Kingdom general election, and was re-elected, this time opposed, by a majority of 541. After that election the Liberals were returned to power. Asher took office in that government, again as Solicitor General for Scotland, serving for another two years.\n\nShortly prior to the 1895 general election, Asher was rumoured to be the Government nominee for the position of Speaker of the House of Commons. Although he was not chosen as the Speaker, he retained his seat with a margin of 1,853 votes against the tally of 1,161 won by C.O. Gordon.\n\nThere were rumours that the Conservative Party might put forward a candidate to oppose Asher in the 1900 general election. But as of five days before the election, Asher remained unopposed. John Moffat stepped forward shortly before the election on behalf of the Liberal Unionist Party, but was defeated by Asher, 1187 votes to 1744.\n\nAsher fell ill while in London as he was leaving the House of Commons from an evening sitting in July 1905. He remained in bed for the following month, and following a worsening of his condition on 31 July, Asher became eager to return home to Scotland. He returned home to Edinburgh on 4 August where he died at his residence, Beechwood House in Corstorphine, the following day. He is buried in Corstorphine churchyard in the west of the city. The granite Celtic cross marking the grave lies to the west of the church.\n\nAt the time of his death, the media described him as \"one of the most eminent advocates from the Scottish bar\". He left personal estates in the United Kingdom worth £39,378, of which £17,189 was in Scotland. He left no public bequests, but instead granted legacies to a number of his former servants.\n\nIn 1870 he married Caroline Julia Gregan Craufurd, the daughter of Rev. C. H. Gregan Craufurd.\n\n"}
{"id": "2162119", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2162119", "title": "Merry Andrew (film)", "text": "Merry Andrew (film)\n\nMerry Andrew is a 1958 American musical film directed and choreographed by Michael Kidd and starring Danny Kaye. The screenplay by Isobel Lennart and I.A.L. Diamond is based on the short story \"The Romance of Henry Menafee\" by Paul Gallico. Saul Chaplin composed the music and Johnny Mercer wrote the lyrics for the film's score.\n\nAndrew Larabee teaches at a school run by his headmaster father Matthew, a traditional man who disapproves of his son's unconventional methods despite their popularity with the students. Andrew's special interest is archaeology, and he hopes to earn his father's respect through this field of study.\n\nDuring the school holidays, Andrew bicycles to ancient ruins in Sussex where he believes a statue of Pan (which had been left behind by a Roman legion) can be found. Such a discovery would enable him to publish and subsequently wed Letitia Fairchild, his fiancée of five years, who insists he earn a promotion before she marries him. At the site he encounters the Gallini family traveling circus, which has been ordered to pack up and leave by the local police since the land is now property of dairy farmer Lord Elmwood. The five Gallini brothers and their cousin Selena mistake Andrew for a contractor, and when he tells them he doesn't mind if they remain, the Gallinis halt their \"pulling up stakes\". Lord Elmwood arrives and threatens to remove both Andrew and the circus, but Andrew realizes he's a former fellow Oxford University student with a checkered romantic past. Chastened by Andrew’s subtle threat of blackmail, Lord Elmwood agrees to give Andrew and the Gallinis a week before he starts construction on the land.\n\nShortly after he has begun his excavations, Andrew discovers a tunnel on the site and burrows through its ceiling and directly into the middle of the lion act during a performance. His amusingly masterful way with the animals impresses Selena, who tells him he is a born entertainer, and she teaches him to juggle. With ringmaster Antonio suffering from laryngitis, Andrew is coaxed into replacing him at the matinee. Unfortunately, Letitia and Andrew's brother Dudley arrive to check on Andrew's progress and decide to attend the circus, so Andrew is disguised as Antonio. Due to needing a lot of padding to fit into Antonio's clothes, Andrew is given a RAF safety life jacket with a whistle, smoke and emergency flares — all of which cause havoc in mid-speech and marking Andrew as a natural clown.\n\nAfter the performance, Selena is overcome with jealousy at the sight of Andrew and Letitia together, and later follows Andrew into the tunnel. Andrew does some more digging, inadvertently causing a cave-in which traps both of them overnight. The following morning, Angelina the chimpanzee, who is tied to a stake by a rope, attempts to get a banana which has been thrown to her out of her reach. As Angelina pulls on the rope, the stake moves, causing the earth around it to collapse and revealing Andrew and Selena. When Antonio and his sons discover them, they accuse Andrew of improper behavior with their Selena and, to save the family honor, insist the two wed on the following Saturday.\n\nAngelina the chimpanzee then finds the Pan statue Andrew was seeking and conceals it in her cage. Andrew convinces Selena his obligations at school override their wedding plans and he returns home, where he discovers his father has promoted him and Letitia is ready to accept him as her husband — with their marriage having also been set to take place on the following Saturday. On the night before the ceremony, Selena brings Andrew the statue of Pan which Angelina had given to her.\n\nBecause Andrew's class has performed well in their last test, the Headmaster has promised them a treat. However, when the boys choose to go to the Gallini Circus, which is due to arrive, Andrew refuses to take them there. So the boys disappear on the day of the wedding, and Andrew tracks them back to the circus. His father and brothers discover the statue of Pan, and Dudley mentions that a circus was in the field in which Andrew was searching for Pan. Accompanied by Letitia and her father, Andrew's father and brothers follow him to the circus where they find Andrew being chased by the Gallini brothers. When Andrew is confronted by two upset families, he finally clears things up and admits that he loves Selena.\n\nFollowing the wedding ceremony, Andrew and Dudley leave the church arm-in-arm with Letitia. After the happy couple - Dudley and Letitia - drive away on their honeymoon, Matthew gives his blessing to Andrew, saying that Andrew was carrying on a fine family tradition (one of their ancestors, Thomas Larabee, had been a jester in the court of King James the First). A very happy Andrew then leaves with his bride-to-be Selena and the equally happy members of the Gallini family.\n\n\n\nThe film's soundtrack was released on compact disc by DRG on July 11, 2006.\n\nAccording to MGM records the film earned $1,180,000 in the US and Canada and $2,350,000 elsewhere, recording a loss of $837,000.\n\nBosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" called the film \"what the doctor ordered to help shake the winter blues\" and added, \"It isn't the most original or inventive vehicle in which the cheering Mr. Kaye has come bouncing down the road. It is, in fact, a rather obvious and narrowly confined piece of comical contrivance for the genial performer to command . . . Successively, the scriptwriters and director Michael Kidd put Mr. Kaye through various fumbles . . . Once in a while, the star is needled into doing a pleasant song . . . Indeed, it would be most gratifying if there were more of this sort of thing in the show. However, it's ample entertainment.\"\n\n\"Variety\" said the film \"has a happy-go-chuckley attitude and some smart musical numbers set up by stand-out music and lyrics. Against this is the fact that the production does not always maintain its own set of very high comedy values, nor the pace of its initial scenes. Michael Kidd, who makes his screen debut as a director, still has a lot to learn about comedy set-ups and this unsureness is made the more evident by the contrast of the narrative stretches with the brisk and imaginative manner in which Kidd has choreographed the musical numbers. Here he is on experienced ground and he shows it.\"\n\n\n"}

Though they are often held at the beginning of summer, they are staged in the autumn or spring seasons, especially in countries where the summer is very harsh. Schools stage many sports days in which children participate in the sporting events. It is usually held in elementary schools.\n\nIn schools which use a house system a feature of the school is the competition between the houses; this is especially brought out during sporting events such as an inter-house sports day.\n\nGames that are played on school sports days can be wide and varied. They can include straightforward sprints and longer races for all age groups as well as egg and spoon races. Three legged races are run as well as sack races, wheelbarrow races, and parent and child races.\n\nAdditional games are traditionally run in Ireland, and the UK, such as horseshoes.\n\nThere have been a number of controversies surrounding school sports days in recent years, many of which have been publicised by the media.\n\nSome schools have abolished or heavily altered sports days on the grounds that they are too competitive and may damage pupils' self-esteem, with some commentators calling for the event to be banned due to the public humiliation caused to those children who are not gifted athletically. This view has been condemned as \"political correctness\" by many commentators, notably by journalist Melanie Phillips in her 1996 book \"All Must Have Prizes\"., a book heavily criticised by reviewers for its alleged prejudiced, fact-less and distorted analyses.\n\nIn June 2005, \"Country Life\" magazine published a report claiming that school sports days have become excessively competitive due to overbearing and \"over-zealous\" parents, who place too much pressure on their children to succeed. The report also revealed that many schools have banned \"mothers and fathers\" races due to fighting and cheating.\n\nSince the mid-1990s, a number of schools and education authorities have banned photography and filming with video cameras at sports days and other school events. Some authorities cite general privacy issues as justification for the ban. Others have raised concerns about pedophiles, which in turn has sparked accusations of hysteria and moral panic. Many parents have expressed anger at being unable to take photographs or videos as souvenirs of these events, and the ban has been criticised by some as a paranoid over-reaction to public concerns about pedophilia and child safety issues.\n\nIn India, sports days are held for 2 - 3 days. These include games like football, cricket, throw ball, dodge ball, volleyball, track and field, basketball etc. These sports days are held between the various houses in a particular school. In India, many traditional games such as Kho-Kho and Kabaddi, March-past are played.\n\nSports day, called \"undōkai\" (運動会) in Japanese, is usually held on a Saturday or Sunday in Japanese schools. During weeks preceding the sports day, students practice their events which they would like to show their parents and friends, within their class of physical education, which often includes \"tamaire\", performances by the school band and presentations by various school clubs as well as individual and group competitive events. These practices, and the sports days themselves, normally take place on the schools' fields, which provide little relief from the heat and sun.\n\nSome schools have responded by scheduling their sports days during cooler months and by encouraging their students to drink water regularly. Currently, the event occurs most often in the autumn (September/October), or in the spring (May/June). In primary schools in Hokkaidō, the event is usually held between the later part of May and the earlier part of June.\n\nSports Day in Russia is held on the second Saturday in August. \n\nSports day is a national holiday, held every second-Tuesday of February every year. The Olympic Committee is tasked with organizing the large-scale nationwide activities that are held all over Qatar, and include a wide variety of sports such as; football, basketball, tennis, marathons, open walks, as well as regional sports such as camel riding. Other venues of sports day include Aspire Zone, Katara, The Pearl, among others. Sports day's popularity extends to the point that Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, Qatar's Emir is casually seen participating in events.\n\nMany large organizations have sports days for their employees. One notable example is Her Majesty's Civil Service in the UK, which holds a number of departmental sports days.\n"}

She had roles in films including Billy Wilder's crime drama \"Witness for the Prosecution\" and Stanley Donen's musical comedy \"Funny Face\" and also is remembered for her guest appearance in a 1963 episode of Rod Serling's sci-fi series \"The Twilight Zone\" called \"A Short Drink from a Certain Fountain\".\n\nLee guest-starred on many television series, and was also featured on a number of game shows, including \"Hollywood Squares\", \"What's My Line?\", \"Match Game\" and as Alex Trebek's co-host on \"High Rollers\".\n\nRuta Lee was born Ruta Mary Kilmonis on May 30, 1935, in Montreal, Quebec, the only child of Lithuanian Roman Catholic immigrants. Her father was a tailor and her mother a homemaker.\n\nOn March 1, 1948, her family moved to the United States and ended up settling in Los Angeles, where she graduated in 1954 from Hollywood High School and began studying acting and appearing in school plays. She attended both Los Angeles City College and the University of California at Los Angeles. She worked as a cashier, usherette, and candy girl at Grauman's Chinese Theater; but, when she was $40 short in her cash account at the end of her shift one night, she was fired. She is a naturalized United States citizen.\n\nLee then got a break as a guest on two episodes of CBS's \"The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show\". She soon found an agent, who landed her a job in an episode of \"The Roy Rogers Show\", followed by a spot in 1953 on the series \"Adventures of Superman\". That same year, while acting in a small theater production of \"On the Town\", she landed a role as bride Ruth in the Academy Award-nominated musical \"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers\", still billed as Ruta Kilmonis. After that success, Lee appeared in several films including \"Anything Goes\" (1956), \"Funny Face\" (1957), \"Witness for the Prosecution\" (1957), and \"Marjorie Morningstar\" (1958). In 1962, Lee had the female lead in the Rat Pack comedy/Western film \"Sergeants 3\" starring Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr. and Peter Lawford. She then co-starred with Audie Murphy and Darren McGavin in a Western, \"Bullet for a Badman\" (1964).\n\nIn addition to films, Lee has appeared in dozens of guest-starring roles on television. For a number of years, she seemed to be everywhere on the screen. From 1957 to 1959, she was cast in different roles in eight episodes of the CBS crime drama series, \"The Lineup\" and also played the leading lady in three episodes of \"Maverick\", \"The Comstock Conspiracy\" with James Garner and \"The Plunder of Paradise,\" and \"Betrayal\" with Jack Kelly. In 1959 and 1960, she was cast in four episodes of John Bromfield's syndicated crime drama, \"U.S. Marshal\".\n\nShe appeared as Ellen Barton in the 1960 episode \"Grant of Land\" of the ABC Western series, \"The Rebel\", starring Nick Adams.

Lee starred as Vivian Cosgrave in the episode \"The Case of the Libelous Locket\" (1963).\n\nOn December 10, 1962, Lee was cast as Lenore Walton Hanford in \"Wanted for the Murder of Cheyenne Bodie\", the penultimate episode of the ABC/Warner Bros. Western series, \"Cheyenne\", with Clint Walker in the starring role. In the storyline, Bodie is mistaken for a notorious gunfighter and framed for his \"own\" murder.\n\nIn 1963, Lee guest starred as Lucy Tolliver in the twelfth episode \"Enough Rope\" of the NBC/WB Western series, \"Temple Houston\", with Jeffrey Hunter as an historical figure, the frontier lawyer Temple Lea Houston, youngest son of Sam Houston. \"Temple Houston\" was canceled after twenty-six weeks. Of Hunter, Lee said, \"He was one of the prettiest people that ever was put on the screen, God, he was gorgeous.\"\n\nLee was further cast on \"Richard Diamond, Private Detective\", \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\", \"Maverick\", \"Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer\", \"Sugarfoot\", \"M Squad\", \"Gunsmoke\", \"77 Sunset Strip\", \"The Alaskans\", \"Colt .45\", \"Wagon Train\", \"Hawaiian Eye\", \"Rawhide\", \"The Wild Wild West\", \"Ironside\", \"The Fugitive\" and three episodes of \"Hogan's Heroes\".

In 1963, she was cast in CBS's \"The Twilight Zone\" in the episode \"A Short Drink from a Certain Fountain\", as a woman whose elderly husband undergoes a scientific experiment and then ages backward.\n\nLee also began appearing regularly on game shows such as \"Hollywood Squares\", \"You Don't Say\" and \"Match Game\". In the early 1970s, Lee continued to perform in both films and television roles on \"Love, American Style\", \"The Mod Squad\", and a role in the film \"The Doomsday Machine\" (1972). By 1974, Lee had grown frustrated by an increasing lack of roles, and took a job co-hosting the daytime game show \"High Rollers\". She remained with the show until 1976.\n\nDuring the 1980s, she lent her voice to episodes of \"The Flintstone Comedy Show\" and \"The Smurfs\", in addition to guest roles on \"CHiPs\", \"Fantasy Island\", \"The Love Boat\" and \"Charles in Charge\". Lee also performed extensively in the mid-1980s on stage, including the title character in the musical \"Peter Pan\".\n\nFrom 1988 to 1989, Lee had a recurring role on the CBS sitcom, \"Coming of Age\". In 1989, she played the role of Sally Powers in the television movie \"Sweet Bird of Youth\" with Elizabeth Taylor. In the 1990s, Lee continued to appear in episodic television, most notably on the sitcom \"Roseanne\". Lee appeared as the girlfriend of Bev Harris (Estelle Parsons) whose character disclosed she was gay.\n\nShe played the wife of comedian Jerry Lewis in the British comedy-drama \"Funny Bones\" (1995), in which they play the parents of the Oliver Platt's character.

In 1995, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars was dedicated to Lee.\n\nIn February 2008, Lee appeared as Clairee in a production of \"Steel Magnolias\" with Sally Struthers at the Casa Mañana theatre in Fort Worth, Texas. In October 2010, Lee played the role of Miss Mona in \"The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas\", also at the Casa Mañana Theatre.\n\nIn 1976, Lee married Texas restaurant executive Webster B. \"Webb\" Lowe Jr. They divide their time between their homes in Hollywood, Palm Springs, Fort Worth and Mexico. She has no children. Lee describes her political views as \"conservative\" and she appeared at the 1972 Republican National Convention. On August 24, 2013, Lee was inducted into the National Lithuanian American Hall of Fame.\n\nIn February 2019, Lee acquired Lithuanian citizenship.\n\nIn 1964, Lee called then-Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, asking him to pardon her grandmother Ludvise Kamandulis, who had been in an internment camp in Siberia since World War II. The pardon was granted, and Lee's grandmother came to live with her in California in 1964. Kamandulis died two years later. Lee again rescued a relative from the former Soviet Union when she secured custody of her 18-year-old cousin, Maryte Kaseta, from Lithuania in 1987.\nLee has been involved with the charitable organization The Thalians for over 50 years. In addition to raising money and providing services for troubled youth and mental health organizations, Lee, who is also the board chairman, co-produced the annual Ball of the Thalians with the late Debbie Reynolds throughout these five decades. In 2011, after 55 years of involvement with The Thalians, she stepped down and is now a member emerita.\n\n"}

Whyte\n\nJames Aitken Whyte (28 January 1920 – 17 June 2005) was a Scottish theologian, presbyterian minister, and academic. He served as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland from 1988 to 1989.\n\nJames Whyte was the second son of Andrew Whyte, a provision merchant in Leith, and his wife Barbaro Janet Pitillo Aitken. He was brought up in Edinburgh, attended Melville College and studied philosophy (he was awarded a First class honours MA degree in 1942) and divinity at the University of Edinburgh.\n\nAfter his ordination in 1945 he spent three years as a chaplain to the first battalion of the Scots Guards, and then served as a parish minister at Dunollie Road Church in Oban (inducted 1948) and Mayfield North in Edinburgh (1954). In 1958 he was appointed Professor of Practical theology and Christian ethics at St Mary's College, the divinity faculty of the University of St Andrews and was Principal of St Mary's 1978-1982. His academic work focused mainly on the study of pastoral theology, liturgy and ecclesiastical architecture. He served as convenor of the General Assembly's Inter-Church Relations Committee. After his retirement from the University in 1987, he became Associate Minister of Hope Park, St Andrews. He was moderator of the 1988 General Assembly. In 1942 Whyte married his first wife Elisabeth Mill who died during his moderatorial year of 1988. He was survived by his second wife, primary school teacher Ishbel (née MacAuley) and his daughter and two sons from his first marriage.\n\nJames Whyte was an influential figure in the Church and in Scottish life, largely because of his reputation as a pastor. Four events brought him to the centre of public attention.\n\nDuring his time as Principal of St Mary's it came to light that one of his students had previously served a sentence for murder. There followed a public controversy about whether this man could become a minister of the Church. Whyte argued on the basis of the Christian doctrine of forgiveness and persuaded the General Assembly not to block the ordination.\n\nPrime Minister Margaret Thatcher was invited to address the 1988 General Assembly and gave the speech which the press dubbed the Sermon on the Mound, which attempted to suggest a theological basis for her style of capitalism. As Moderator, Whyte responded by presenting her with church reports on housing and poverty. He professed himself astonished at the public controversy which this relatively restrained censure unleashed. In his speech to the General Assembly the following year he recalled (referring to the Conservative baron Sir Nicholas Fairbairn): \"one knight-errant looking for a windmill to tilt at even described me as 'Satanic' !\"\n\nAs Moderator, Whyte was called on to preach at the memorial service for the victims of the Lockerbie disaster on 4 January 1989. This sermon was widely cited in the press and had a great impact:\nThe full text of this sermon was published in \"Laughter and Tears\" pp 92–5.\n\nAfter the Dunblane Massacre in 1996 the families of the victims requested that Whyte conduct the memorial service on 9 October that year. The text of the sermon he preached on this occasion appears in \"The Dream and the Grace\" pp 125–9.\n\nWhyte was renowned for his witty comments on Scottish public life. When the Conservative government privatised the Trustee Savings Bank in 1985 he wrote a three-sentence letter to \"The Scotsman\": \"Bankrobbery is the word we use to describe the crime of stealing from a bank. But what word can we use to describe the crime of stealing a bank? Words cannot describe the crimes of government!\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2162195", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2162195", "title": "Japanese Braille", "text": "Japanese Braille\n\nJapanese Braille is the braille script of the Japanese language. It is based on the original braille script, though the connection is tenuous. In Japanese it is known as , literally \"dot characters\". It transcribes Japanese more or less as it would be written in the \"hiragana\" or \"katakana\" syllabaries, without any provision for writing \"kanji\" (Chinese characters).\n\nJapanese Braille is a vowel-based abugida. That is, the glyphs are syllabic, but unlike kana they contain separate symbols for consonant and vowel, and the vowel takes primacy. The vowels are written in the upper left corner (points 1, 2, 4) and may be used alone. The consonants are written in the lower right corner (points 3, 5, 6) and cannot occur alone. However, the semivowel \"y\" is indicated by point 4, one of the vowel points, and the vowel combination is dropped to the bottom of the block. When this point is written in isolation, it indicates that the following syllable has a medial \"y\", as in \"mya\". Syllables beginning with \"w\" are indicated by dropping the vowel points to the bottom of the cell without additional consonant points.\n\nThe chart below shows each braille character under the corresponding \"hiragana\" and its romanization. In order to illustrate the derivation of each character from its component vowel and consonant, the vowel points are written in black, and the consonant points in green. There is no such distinction in braille as it is actually used.\n\nThe vowels are assigned the braille patterns that occupy the upper-left half of the cell (dots 1-2-4) in numerical order: . (These are the first five letters of Braille's alphabet, , rotated to fit the available space.) The consonantal diacritics, on the other hand, have no apparent connection to international values or numerical order, corresponding as they do to international punctuation and formatting marks.\n\nIn kana, a small \"tsu\" (), called \"sokuon\", is used to indicate that the following consonant is geminate, and in interjections as a glottal stop. In katakana only, a long vowel is indicated with a horizontal stroke () called a chōon. This also looks like a half dash in braille:\n\nThe placement of these blocks mirrors the equivalent kana: the \"sokuon\" indicates that the following consonant is geminate, whereas the \"chōon\" indicates that the preceding vowel is long.\n\nIn kana, the voiced consonants \"g, z, d, b\" are derived from the voiceless consonants \"k, s, t, h\" by adding a diacritic called \"dakuten\" to the kana, as in \"gi\"; in foreign words, \"vu\" is written by adding this to the vowel \"u\". Similarly, \"p\" is derived from \"h\" by adding a small circle, \"handakuten\". Two kana are fused into a single syllable by writing the second small, as in \"kya\" from \"ki + ya\"; this is called \"yōon\".\n\nIn Japanese Braille, the signs for these are prefixes. That is, the order is \"dakuten\" + \"ki\" for \"gi\". When more than one occurs in a single syllable, they are combined in a single prefix block, as the \"yōon-dakuten\" used for \"gya\".\n\nThe \"yōon\" prefix uses the point that represents \"y\" in the blocks \"ya\", \"yu\", \"yo\". When placed before \"ka\", \"ku\", \"ko\", it produces \"kya\", \"kyu\", \"kyo\". Likewise, the \"yōon-dakuten\" prefix before \"ka, ku, ko\" creates \"gya, gyu, gyo.\" And so on for the other consonants.\n\nUnlike kana, which uses a subscript \"e\", in braille the \"-ye\" in foreign borrowings is written with \"yōon\" and the kana from the \"e\" row: that is, \"kye\", \"she\", \"che\", \"nye\", \"hye\", \"mye\", \"rye\", voiced \"gye\", \"je\", \"bye\", and plosive \"pye\" are written with the \"yōon\" prefixes plus \"ke\", \"se\", \"te\", \"ne\", \"he\", \"me\", \"re\". The syllable \"ye\" is written \"yōon\" plus \"e.\"\n\nThere is also a prefix for medial \"-w-\" called \"gōyōon\". When combined with \"ka\", it produces the obsolete syllable \"kwa\". It may also be fused with the voicing prefix for \"gwa\". For foreign borrowings, this extends to \"kwi\", \"kwe\", \"kwo\" and \"gwa\", \"gwi\", \"gwe\", \"gwo\". \"Gōyōon\" may also be combined with the vowels \"i\", \"e\", \"o\" for foreign \"wi\", \"we\", \"wo\" (now that the \"w\" in the original Japanese kana for \"wi\", \"we\", \"wo\" is silent); with \"ha\", \"hi\", \"he\", \"ho\" for \"fa\", \"fi\", \"fe\", \"fo\" and (when voiced) for \"va\", \"vi\", \"ve\", \"vo\"; and with \"ta\", \"chi\", \"te\", \"to\" for \"tsa\", \"tsi\", \"tse\", \"tso\". These two prefixes are identical to the question mark and full stop.\n\nThese all parallel usage in kana. However, there are additional conventions which are unique to braille. \"Yōon\" and \"yōon-dakuten\" are also added to \"chi\" and \"shi\" to write \"ti\", \"di\" and \"si\", \"zi\" found in foreign borrowings; similarly \"gōyōon\" and \"gōyōon-dakuten\" are added to \"tsu\" to write \"tu\", \"du\". This differs from the system used in kana, where the base syllables are \"te\" and \"to\" respectively, and a subscript vowel \"i\" or \"u\" is added.\n\nIn an assignment that is counter-intuitive in kana, \"yōon + handakuten\" is prefixed to \"tsu\", \"yu\", \"yo\" to produce \"tyu\", \"fyu\", \"fyo\" in foreign words, and voiced for \"dyu\", \"vyu\", \"vyo\". The latter—\"yōon + dakuten + handakuten\", is impossible in kana:\n\nJapanese Braille is written as print Japanese would be written in kana. However, there are three discrepancies:\n\nBesides the punctuation of Japanese, braille also has symbols to indicate that the following characters are digits or the Latin alphabet.\n\nAs noted above, the space is used between words and also where an interpunct would be used when names are written in katakana. There are several additional punctuation marks.\n\nWestern letters and digits are indicated as follows:\n\nAn additional sign indicates that the following characters are specifically English words and not just in the Latin alphabet.\n\nWords immediately follow numbers, unless they begin with a vowel or with \"r-\". Because the syllables \"a i u e o\" and \"ra ri ru re ro\" are homographic with the digits 0–9, a hyphen is inserted to separate them. Thus \"six people\" (\"6 nin\") is written without a hyphen, , but \"six yen\" (\"6 en\") is written with a hyphen, , because would be read as .\n\nAn eight-dot extension of Japanese Braille, \"kantenji\", has been devised to transcribe kanji.\n\n"}

They ruled these areas on behalf of the \"Umayyad\" Caliphate of Cordoba in the end of the 10th century and the first half of the 11th century.\n\nThe Meghrawa, a tribe of Zanata Berbers, were one of the first Berber tribes to submit to Islam in the 7th century. They supported Uqba ibn Nafi in his campaign to the Atlantic in 683. They defected from Sunni Islam and became Kharijites Muslims from the 8th century, and allied first with the Shia Muslim Idrisids, and, from the 10th century, with the Andalusian Umayyads of Córdoba. As a result, they were caught up in the Umayyad-Fatimid conflict in Morocco and Algeria. Although they won a victory over the allies of the Fatimids in 924, they soon became allied with them themselves. When they switched back to the side of Córdoba, they were driven out of central Morocco by the Zirids, who ruled on behalf of the Fatimids. In 980, however, they were able to drive the Miknasa out of Sijilmasa.\n\nUnder Ziri ibn Atiyya (to 1001) the Meghrawa achieved supremacy in Fez under Umayyad suzerainty and expanded their territory at the expense of the Banu Ifran.

He is currently signed to WWE, where he performs on the SmackDown brand under the ring name The Miz.\n\nMizanin first gained fame as a reality television participant. He was a cast member on MTV's \"\" in 2001 and subsequently appeared in its spinoff series, \"Real World/Road Rules Challenge\" from 2002 to 2005, where he won \"\" and \"\". Furthermore, he reached the final in \"Battle of the Network Reality Stars\" and won a 3-part Reality Stars-themed episode of \"Fear Factor\" in 2006. After becoming the runner-up in the fourth season of \"Tough Enough\" and subsequently launching his WWE career, Mizanin appeared on \"Diva Search\", \"Total Divas\" and \"Tough Enough\" and hosted several seasons of \"The Challenge\". He and his wife Maryse also starred in their own reality show titled \"Miz & Mrs.\" that premiered in 2018. He has also come to star in several films produced by WWE Studios, portraying Jake Carter in \"The Marine\" franchise as well as starring in \"Christmas Bounty\" and \"Santa's Little Helper\".\n\nAfter being trained at Deep South Wrestling and Ohio Valley Wrestling, he was promoted to the main roster in 2006. Within WWE, The Miz has won eighteen total championships: the WWE Championship once, the Intercontinental Championship eight times, the United States Championship twice, and eight tag team championships (two World Tag Team, four WWE (now Raw) Tag Team, and two SmackDown Tag Team), making him the 25th Triple Crown Champion and 14th Grand Slam Champion in company history. The Miz also won the 2010 Raw Money in the Bank ladder match, and was ranked number one on \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\" (\"PWI\")'s annual \"PWI 500\" list for 2011. He is one of the 10 most prolific pay-per-view performers in WWE history. The Miz has headlined several pay-per-view events for WWE, including WrestleMania XXVII.\n\nMichael Gregory Mizanin was born on October 8, 1980 in Parma, Ohio, where he was raised. He is of German, Slovak, Greek, Romanian, and English descent. His parents are divorced; he has a step-father and two half-siblings. He attended Normandy High School and was the captain of its basketball and cross country teams. He also participated in swimming, was a member of the student government and edited the yearbook. He then attended Miami University, where he was a member of the Theta Chi fraternity and studied business at the Richard T. Farmer School of Business before he was cast as a member of \"The Real World\" (2001).\n\nMizanin dropped out of college, where he was pursuing a degree in business, in order to appear on the of MTV's reality television program \"The Real World\" in 2001. He went on to appear in multiple seasons of its spin-off series, \"Real World/Road Rules Challenge\", along with contestants from both \"Road Rules\" and \"The Real World\", including \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\" and \"\". Except for \"Battle of the Sexes 2\", Mizanin made it to the end of all the \"Challenges\" on which he competed and won both \"Battle of the Seasons\" and \"The Inferno 2\".\n\nIt was during an episode of \"The Real World\" that Mizanin first displayed an alter ego known as \"The Miz\". In contrast to Mizanin's usually placid demeanor, The Miz was angry, combative and headstrong. Mizanin later realized that The Miz would make an excellent professional wrestling gimmick.\n\nIn 2004, he appeared on the Bravo reality show \"Battle of the Network Reality Stars\", in which his team finished second. Mizanin was also a contestant in the \"Reality Stars\" episode of \"Fear Factor\". His partner was his former girlfriend and castmate, Trishelle Cannatella, and the two won the competition. In April 2007, he appeared on the game show \"Identity\", where he appeared as a stranger, and contestant John Kim correctly identified his identity as a professional wrestler by the odd way he added \"Miz-\" before most words. On October 5, 2011, Miz starred in an episode of \"H8R\".\n\nAfter a seven-year-long absence from \"The Real World/Road Rules Challenge\", Mizanin returned to the reality show on April 4, 2012 as the host of \"\" season finale event and reunion special. It marked the first time The Miz appeared on the series since becoming a main-event WWE Superstar.\n\nNon-reality television appearances\n\nIn 2008, Mizanin appeared on the Sci Fi reality series \"Ghost Hunters Live\" as a guest investigator. In 2009, Mizanin appeared on two episodes of \"Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader?\", which were both aired on September 29. He appeared on an episode of \"Destroy Build Destroy\" on March 3, 2010. He also appeared as a guest star in a March 2012 episode of \"Psych\". On March 31, Miz appeared in the first ever Slime Wrestling World Championship at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards, losing to Big Show and therefore being thrown into a tub of slime. In 2012, Miz appeared on the Disney XD show \"Pair of Kings\" as a guest star. In 2013, Miz along with Francia Raisa were in a movie together called \"Christmas Bounty\".\n\nPursuing the goal of becoming a professional wrestler, Mizanin joined Ultimate Pro Wrestling (UPW), where he trained in the Ultimate University. He made his in-ring debut in 2003 as The Miz. During his time with UPW, The Miz competed in UPW's Mat War's tournament, making it to the finals before losing to Tony Stradlin.\n\nIn October 2004, Mike Mizanin entered the fourth season of \"Tough Enough\", a televised competition which awarded the winner a World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) contract and US$1,000,000. Despite coming last in an arm wrestling tournament on November 25, Mizanin outlasted six other wrestlers and reached the final round. At Armageddon, Mizanin faced the other remaining entrant, Daniel Puder, in a three-round \"Dixie Dogfight\" (boxing match). Neither man achieved a knockout, and the contest was awarded to Puder on the basis of crowd reaction. On the December 16 episode of \"SmackDown\", Puder was declared as the winner of \"Tough Enough\" by head trainer Al Snow. Despite coming up short on \"Tough Enough\", Mizanin had piqued the interest of WWE and he was eventually offered a developmental contract.\n\nMizanin was sent to Deep South Wrestling (DSW) to train under Bill DeMott, relocating to McDonough, Georgia in the process. In July 2005, he wrestled two dark matches for WWE, teaming with former \"Tough Enough\" champion Matt Cappotelli to face The Highlanders (Robbie and Rory McAllister). On December 1, Mizanin defeated Mike Knox in the finals of a tournament to determine the inaugural Deep South Heavyweight Champion. He continued his partnership with Matt Cappotelli throughout the second half of 2005 in WWE dark matches and house shows until Cappotelli, nominally of Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), was diagnosed with a brain tumor after an injury at a taping in December 2005. After Cappotelli's death from brain cancer in June 2018, Miz revealed they were to be called up to the SmackDown roster as a tag team known as Reality Check in 2005, but these plans were halted due to Cappotelli's cancer diagnosis.\n\nOn January 3, 2006, it was reported that Mizanin had been transferred to OVW. On the January 18, 2006 OVW TV show, Mizanin made his debut as Miz with a \"Miz TV\" segment, where he was shown talking backstage. On the January 28 episode of the OVW television show, The Miz wrestled his first singles match against René Duprée, but lost by countout.\n\nAt the February 8 \"OVW\" TV taping, Miz and Chris Cage captured the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship, defeating Chet the Jett and Seth Skyfire. On March 19, Deuce Shade defeated Miz in a singles contest to win the championship for his team The Untouchables (Deuce Shade and Domino).\n\nFrom March 7 onwards, a video on WWE's website and vignettes on \"SmackDown!\" heralded The Miz debuting on the SmackDown! brand. When Mizanin actually attempted to make his debut on the April 21 episode of \"SmackDown!\", he was in storyline banned from entering the arena by network executive Palmer Canon who told him that he had been \"cancelled\" before having security escort him from the premises.\n\nThe Miz debuted as the host of \"SmackDown!\" on June 2, hyping up the crowd at the top of the show. Other duties included backstage interviews and hosting a bikini contest. Starting in July, Miz, along with Ashley Massaro, hosted the annual \"Diva Search\" competition.\n\nAfter the end of the \"Diva Search\" competition, The Miz began wrestling as a villain, making his in-ring debut with win over Tatanka on the September 1 episode of \"SmackDown!\". Over the next three months, The Miz remained undefeated, defeating such wrestlers as Matt Hardy, Funaki and Scotty 2 Hotty. At the same time he began a feud with Diva Search winner Layla El, who spurned his advances on more than one occasion, leading to Miz helping Kristal defeat her in various competitions. However, Miz and Kristal soon found themselves being stalked by The Boogeyman. This began a feud in which the Boogeyman ended The Miz's winning streak at December's Armageddon event.\n\nThe Miz entered in the 2007 Royal Rumble match as the 29th entrant. However, his Royal Rumble debut did not go as planned, as he was immediately thrown out by The Great Khali, lasting only seven seconds. Following a brief absence from television, The Miz returned on the March 9 episode of \"SmackDown!\" to host an interview segment named \"Miz TV\". After the unsuccessful segment, The Miz returned to in-ring competition with a more intense style and began to pick up wins once again.\n\nMiz was drafted to the ECW brand on June 17 as part of the 2007 supplemental draft. He was absent from the first few weeks of \"ECW\", though he was the subject of backstage mentions between matches and had several short \"Miz TV Crashes ECW\" video segments. He made his debut on the July 10 episode of \"ECW\" in a match against Nunzio, which he won.\n\nSoon after, The Miz found new managers in Kelly Kelly, Layla El and Brooke Adams. He then began a feud with Balls Mahoney after Kelly Kelly began to fall in love with Mahoney on screen. On the October 2 episode of \"ECW\", it was revealed that Miz owned the contracts of Kelly Kelly, Layla and Brooke Adams; and he used this excuse to stop Kelly from going out with Mahoney. He was nominated at Cyber Sunday to face CM Punk for the ECW Championship. He won the vote, but lost the match.\n\nOn the November 16 episode of \"SmackDown!\", The Miz became one half of the WWE Tag Team Champions with John Morrison when they defeated Matt Hardy and Montel Vontavious Porter, giving Miz his first championship within the company. At Survivor Series, Miz and Morrison competed in a triple threat match for the ECW Championship, with the champion CM Punk retaining.\n\nIn February 2008, Miz and Morrison were given a streaming segment on the WWE website named \"The Dirt Sheet\" in which they mocked other wrestlers and facets of pop culture, showing off their promo skills. Morrison and The Miz co-wrote each episode of \"The Dirt Sheet\" each week. Miz competed in a battle royal on the pre-show of WrestleMania XXIV, but was unsuccessful in winning after being eliminated by Jamie Noble. The team of Miz and Morrison had many successful title defenses over the next few months before dropping the championship to Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder at the Great American Bash in a fatal four-way match which also involved Jesse and Festus and Finlay and Hornswoggle. Neither Miz nor Morrison were pinned as Hawkins pinned Jesse to win the titles. Miz and Morrison soon followed a feud with Cryme Tyme (Shad Gaspard and JTG) as a battle of their webshows, \"Word Up\" and \"The Dirt Sheet\". They were voted into a match with, and defeated, Cryme Tyme at Cyber Sunday. The team also feuded with D-Generation X (Triple H and Shawn Michaels), using phrases such as \"Are you 50?\" instead of DX's usual catchphrase \"Are you ready?\" to mock their ages due to DX being formed in 1997, when both Miz and Morrison were in high school. On the 800th episode celebration of \"Raw\", Miz and Morrison competed in a match against DX, and were defeated. During the match, they mocked DX's signature moves, with Morrison successfully performing a superkick (mocking Michaels' \"Sweet Chin Music\") on Triple H. On December 13, Miz and Morrison defeated Kofi Kingston and CM Punk to win the World Tag Team Championship during a WWE house show in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.\n\nIn February 2009, the team engaged themselves in a feud with The Colóns (Carlito and Primo). In a dark match at WrestleMania XXV, they lost the World Tag Team Championship to The Colóns in a lumberjack match to unify the World Tag Team and the WWE Tag Team titles. On the April 13 episode of \"Raw\", The Miz lost a match to Kofi Kingston due to Morrison's inadvertent interference, which gave Raw a draft pick in the 2009 WWE draft. The pick was then revealed to be The Miz and retaliated by subsequently attacking Morrison, ending their partnership and thus turning John Morrison into a fan favorite.\n\nMiz challenged John Cena to a match on the April 27 episode of \"Raw\", but as Cena was out due to injury, Miz claimed an unofficial win via forfeit and continued to do this over the following weeks, until Cena returned and defeated him in a singles match at The Bash in June. On the August 3 episode of \"Raw\", The Miz lost a match to Cena, which meant that, in storyline, he was banned from the Staples Center, the Raw brand and SummerSlam. The following week on August 10, Miz competed under a mask as The Calgary Kid and won a Contract on Pole match against Eugene, earning a contract in storyline, and revealing himself by removing his mask afterwards. He then debuted his new finisher, the \"Skull-Crushing Finale\", and used it on Eugene. After removing the mask to reveal himself, he cut a promo and debuted his catchphrase: \"Because I'm The Miz... and I'm awesome\".\n\nMiz would then set his sights on the United States Championship. He unsuccessfully challenged for the championship at the Night of Champions, Breaking Point and Hell in a Cell pay-per-views, before he won the championship on the October 5 episode of \"Raw\", by defeating Kofi Kingston - his first singles championship in WWE. At the following pay-per-view event, Bragging Rights, Miz was inserted into an interpromotional match against SmackDown's Intercontinental Champion, Miz's erstwhile tag team partner John Morrison. At the event on October 25, Miz defeated Morrison. The following month at Survivor Series, Miz captained a team of five wrestlers against Team Morrison in a five-on-five Survivor Series elimination match and once again bested his former partner surviving with Sheamus and Drew McIntyre.\nIn January 2010, The Miz began a rivalry with MVP that began with a critically well-received verbal exchange between the two. The two met in an unadvertised match for the United States Championship at the Royal Rumble event with Miz retaining his title, but in the Royal Rumble match itself MVP eliminated both himself and The Miz. At Elimination Chamber, Miz again successfully defended his United States Championship against MVP after interference from Big Show, ending their feud.\n\nOn the May 10 episode of \"Raw\", Tyson Kidd defeated The Miz in a match, which earned any member of The Hart Dynasty a match for the United States Championship and The Miz, who was allowed to choose his opponent, elected to face Bret Hart. On the following episode of \"Raw\" on May 17, Hart defeated The Miz to win the United States Championship, despite Chris Jericho, William Regal and Vladimir Kozlov attempting to interfere on The Miz's behalf. On the June 14 episode of \"Raw\", The Miz defeated R-Truth, John Morrison and Zack Ryder in a fatal four-way match to win the United States Championship for the second time and retained the championship against R-Truth at the Fatal 4-Way pay-per-view.\n\nIn January 2010, Miz formed a tag team with Big Show — later dubbed \"ShoMiz\" — and on the February 8 episode of \"Raw\" the two defeated D-Generation X and The Straight Edge Society to become the Unified WWE Tag Team Champions, making Miz the first wrestler in WWE history to hold three championships at the same time (United States, World Tag Team and WWE Tag Team Champion). At WrestleMania XXVI on March 28, ShoMiz defeated John Morrison and R-Truth to retain the title again. At Extreme Rules on April 25, ShoMiz lost to The Hart Dynasty in a gauntlet match, which per the match stipulation gifted them a tag team title opportunity. They would receive their title match the following night on \"Raw\", where ShoMiz lost the titles. After the match, Big Show knocked Miz out and was later drafted to the SmackDown brand, dissolving the team.\n\nIn February, Miz began appearing on the \"NXT\" show as the storyline mentor of Daniel Bryan. Miz had a tumultuous relationship with Bryan, who was eliminated from \"NXT\" on May 11, although he returned the following week to attack Miz. Miz returned as a Pro for the second season of \"NXT\", to mentor Alex Riley, the only Pro to return.\n\nOn July 18 at the Money in the Bank pay-per-view, The Miz won a Money in the Bank ladder match to win a contract for a WWE Championship match that he could utilize at any time. Over the next few weeks, The Miz made various, unsuccessful attempts at cashing in his Money in the Bank contract on the WWE Champion Sheamus, as the matches were continually interrupted by other wrestlers before the matches could occur, which meant that he retained the contract for future use. Daniel Bryan returned to WWE at SummerSlam, taking The Miz's place on Team WWE, causing The Miz to attack him mid-match, which would result in Bryan's eventual elimination from the match. This began a rivalry between the two, with The Miz losing the United States Championship to Bryan at the Night of Champions event in September. In October, Miz defeated John Cena (after interference from Husky Harris and Michael McGillicutty) to become the captain of Team Raw, but Team Raw (composed of Miz, R-Truth, John Morrison, Santino Marella, Sheamus, CM Punk and Ezekiel Jackson) were unsuccessful in defeating Team SmackDown at the Bragging Rights pay-per-view.\nOn the November 22 episode of \"Raw\", he cashed in his Money in the Bank contract following a successful WWE Championship defense by Randy Orton against Wade Barrett to become the new WWE Champion. The following week, Miz made his first successful title defense, defeating Jerry \"The King\" Lawler in a Tables, Ladders and Chairs match after interference from Michael Cole. He successfully defended the championship at the pay-per-view in December by defeating Orton in a tables match following interference from Alex Riley. Going into 2011, Miz would then successfully defend the championship against Orton again at the Royal Rumble in January (after interference from CM Punk) and Lawler the following month at Elimination Chamber. On the \"Raw\" after Elimination Chamber, The Miz and John Cena were paired together by the Anonymous Raw General Manager to challenge The Corre (Justin Gabriel and Heath Slater) for the WWE Tag Team Championship. The Miz and Cena were successful in winning the titles, but lost them back to Corre immediately afterward in a rematch after The Miz turned on Cena. This made their reign the shortest in the championship's history. The following week, The Miz lost Riley as his apprentice after Cena defeated Riley in a steel cage match with the stipulation that if Cena won, Riley was fired from his job. However Riley would be re-hired in mid-March, this time as Miz's \"Vice President of Corporate Communications\". In the main event of WrestleMania XXVII on April 3, The Miz successfully defended the WWE Championship against Cena, following interference from The Rock, who then attacked Miz afterwards. The Miz's regisn has been described as a faliure for being \"booked ridicusly weakly\". \nAt Extreme Rules on May 1, The Miz lost the WWE Championship to Cena in a triple threat steel cage match, also involving John Morrison. He then failed to regain the championship from Cena again in an \"I Quit\" match at Over the Limit on May 22, after botched interference from Riley. The following night on \"Raw\", the Anonymous Raw General Manager denied The Miz's request for another WWE Championship match; Miz blamed Riley for being unable to regain the championship. Riley then attacked him, turning Riley into a fan favorite. At Capitol Punishment on June 19, Miz faced Riley in a losing effort. The Miz lost Raw's Money in the Bank ladder match at the titular event as the match was won by Alberto Del Rio. After the WWE Championship was declared vacant by Vince McMahon, Miz would enter into a tournament to crown a new champion, defeating Riley and Kofi Kingston to advance to the finals, where he lost to Rey Mysterio. At SummerSlam in August, Miz teamed with R-Truth and Alberto Del Rio to face Mysterio, Kingston and John Morrison in a losing effort.\n\nOn the August 22 episode of \"Raw\", Miz and R-Truth attacked Santino Marella before his match. They then cut a promo agreeing there was a conspiracy in the WWE keeping both of them out of the main event picture, and declared they would, together, seize any future opportunity. They began referring to themselves as \"The Awesome Truth\". At Night of Champions, after the referee was distracted while The Miz attempted a pin, Miz assaulted him, causing Awesome Truth to lose a WWE Tag Team Championship match to Air Boom (Kofi Kingston and Evan Bourne) by disqualification. Seeking retribution, Miz and Truth later attacked both Triple H and CM Punk during their No Disqualification match in the main event. Because of their actions from the previous night, R-Truth and The Miz were fired by Triple H on the September 19 episode of \"Raw\". At the conclusion of the main event match at Hell in a Cell, R-Truth and The Miz jumped the barricade wearing black hooded sweatshirts and entered the cell as it was being raised. They then used weapons to attack Alberto Del Rio, CM Punk, John Cena, the Referee and camera men while the cell was again lowered. After this, the entire WWE roster led by Triple H came out to find a way into the cell, before New Orleans Police Department officers were able to get the door open and arrest them. The two later posted a video on YouTube apologizing to the fans for their actions. The Miz and R-Truth were reinstated by John Laurinaitis on the October 10 episode of \"Raw\". At Vengeance, Miz and R-Truth defeated CM Punk and Triple H in a tag team match, after interference from Triple H's long time friend Kevin Nash. Later that night they assaulted John Cena during his WWE Championship match with Alberto Del Rio. At Survivor Series in November, The Awesome Truth were defeated by John Cena and The Rock. On the November 21 episode of \"Raw\", Cena instigated an argument between R-Truth and Miz, which resulted in Miz performing a Skull Crushing Finale on the stage on R-Truth. This was a pretext to explain R-Truth's absence during his suspension as a result of his violating of the Wellness Policy.\nOn the November 28 episode of \"Raw\", Miz defeated John Morrison in a Falls Count Anywhere match after a Skull Crushing Finale on the stage. On the December 5, episode of \"Raw\", Miz qualified for a triple threat Tables, Ladders and Chairs match against Alberto Del Rio and CM Punk at the pay-per-view for the WWE Championship after a win over Randy Orton via countout, but was unsuccessful. Miz would be the first entrant in the 2012 Royal Rumble match, scoring two eliminations and lasting over 45 minutes before he was eliminated by Big Show. At Elimination Chamber in February 2012, Miz competed for the WWE Championship in the titular match, which was won by CM Punk.\n\nDesperate for a spot on the card for the upcoming WrestleMania XXVIII event, he later joined John Laurinaitis' team for the 12-man tag team match after saving Laurinaitis from Santino Marella. Miz picked up the win for Team Johnny after pinning Zack Ryder with the help of Eve, ending his twenty-match losing streak dating back to 2011. He followed this up by losing a battle royal and a singles match against Brodus Clay at Over the Limit in May.\n\nAfter a two-month absence, The Miz returned at Money in the Bank as a last-minute participant in the WWE Championship Money in the Bank contract match, won by John Cena. At \"Raw 1000\", Miz defeated Christian to win his first Intercontinental Championship, becoming the 25th Triple Crown Champion and a Grand Slam Champion in the process. Miz successfully defended his championship against Rey Mysterio at SummerSlam in August, and in a fatal four-way match against Cody Rhodes, Mysterio, and Sin Cara at Night of Champions in September, before losing the championship to Kofi Kingston on the premiere episode of \"Main Event\" ending his reign at 85 days. Miz failed to regain the title from Kingston in two rematches—at Hell in a Cell and on the November 6 episode of \"SmackDown\".\n\nAfter his loss to Kofi Kingston, The Miz turned into a fan favorite for the first time since 2006 when he joined Mick Foley's team at Survivor Series after confronting Paul Heyman on the November 12 episode of \"Raw\". At the event on November 18, he eliminated Wade Barrett before being eliminated by Alberto Del Rio; his team would also go onto lose. The Miz then began a feud with United States Champion Antonio Cesaro after Cesaro insulted America.

On the March 14 episode of \"SmackDown\", after a showdown between Miz and Maryse against Cena and Nikki, SmackDown General Manager Daniel Bryan scheduled a mixed tag team match at WrestleMania 33, which Miz and Maryse lost.\n\nOn April 10, Miz was drafted to Raw along with Maryse as part of the Superstar Shake Up, where they made their debut on the same night dressed as Cena and Nikki, before being confronted by the Intercontinental Champion Dean Ambrose, who was also drafted to Raw in the Superstar Shake-up. At Extreme Rules in June, Miz defeated Ambrose to win the Intercontinental Championship for the seventh time.\n\nOn the June 19 episode of \"Raw\", Miz allied himself with Bo Dallas and Curtis Axel, a team which would later dubbed \"The Miztourage\". Miz successfully defended the Intercontinental Championship against Dean Ambrose at Great Balls of Fire on July 9, due to interference from the Miztourage. At the SummerSlam pre-show on August 20, Miz and The Miztourage defeated Jason Jordan and The Hardy Boyz (Jeff Hardy and Matt Hardy) in a six-man tag-team match.\n\nIn September, Miz began a feud with Jordan after he was declared number one contender to Miz's championship. At No Mercy on September 25, Miz successfully retained the championship against Jordan. The following month, he allied himself with Cesaro and Sheamus in order to take on the reformed Shield faction (Ambrose, Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns).

On the 25th anniversary of \"Raw\", he defeated Roman Reigns to win his eighth Intercontinental Championship. Miz then participated in the annual Royal Rumble match at the namesake pay-per-view on January 28, but he failed to win the match after being eliminated by the combined effort of Rollins and Reigns. The next night on \"Raw\", Miz defeated Reigns in a rematch to retain the title. On the February 5 episode of \"Raw\", Miz defeated Apollo Crews to qualify for the 2018 Elimination Chamber match to determine the number-one contender for Brock Lesnar's Universal Championship, where he was the first wrestler eliminated after lasting over 20 minutes. In parallel to his activities as a singles wrestler, Miz took a part of the Mixed Match Challenge tournament, with Asuka as his partner in support of the charity Rescue Dogs Rock. They defeated the teams of Big E and Carmella on January 23, 2018, and Finn Bálor and Sasha Banks on February 27. In the semi-finals on March 20, they defeated the team of Braun Strowman and Alexa Bliss to qualify for the finals. On April 4, they defeated Bobby Roode and Charlotte Flair in the finals to win the tournament and earn $100,000 for their charity.

Later that night in his final match for Raw, Miz teamed with The Miztourage, Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn against Seth Rollins, Finn Bálor, Braun Strowman, Bobby Roode and Bobby Lashley in a ten-man tag team match; his team lost after The Miztourage walked out on him, officially ending their partnership. Miz would fail to regain the Intercontinental Championship from Rollins in a ladder match also involving Finn Bálor and Samoa Joe at the Greatest Royal Rumble event, and subsequently in a singles match at Backlash.\n\nOn the May 8 episode of \"SmackDown Live\", Miz defeated United States Champion Jeff Hardy to qualify for the men's Money in the Bank ladder match at the namesake event. At the event, Miz failed to win the ladder match. Throughout July and August, Miz would taunt and goad long-time rival Daniel Bryan. Despite initially backing down from his Bryan's challenge for a match at SummerSlam, he would later reconsider and accept it. At the event, Miz defeated Bryan, after pinning him following the undetected use of a pair of brass knuckles.\n\nFollowing SummerSlam, it was announced that Miz and Maryse would be facing Bryan and his wife Brie Bella at Hell in a Cell in September. At the event, Miz and Maryse would go on to win the after Maryse pinned Bella. In October, Miz and Bryan were announced to be facing each other once more at the Super Show-Down event with the winner getting a future WWE Championship match. At the event, Miz was defeated by Bryan.\n\nOn the 1000th episode of \"SmackDown\" on October 16, Miz defeated Rusev to qualify for the WWE World Cup tournament to determine the \"Best Wrestler in the World\" at the Crown Jewel event. At the event in November, Miz defeated Jeff Hardy and Rey Mysterio to advance to the finals against Dolph Ziggler, but injured his knee before the match, rendering him unable to compete. SmackDown Commissioner Shane McMahon replaced him and defeated Ziggler, winning the World Cup.\n\nOn the following episode of \"SmackDown\", Bryan and Miz were announced as co-captain of the Men's Survivor Series match at the Survivor Series pay-per-view, however, SmackDown General Manager Paige removed Bryan from the match the following week and replaced him with Jeff Hardy, leaving Miz as the sole captain of Team SmackDown for the event. At the event, Team SmackDown lost to Team Raw.\n\nMiz would begin to pursue a partnership with McMahon, with the promise of becoming the \"best tag team in the world\". McMahon would finally agree to the team proposal in December, turning Miz into a fan favorite for the first time since April 2014. The duo would then challenge SmackDown Tag Team Champions Cesaro and Sheamus to a title match at the 2019 Royal Rumble pay-per-view on January 27, 2019, in which Miz and McMahon would defeat the duo to become the new champions. However, the next month at Elimination Chamber, Miz and McMahon lost the titles to The Usos, ending their reign at 21 days. The duo then failed to regain the titles from the Usos at Fastlane in March. After the loss, McMahon turned on Miz by attacking both him and his father at ringside. This led to a falls count anywhere match at WrestleMania 35, which Miz would lose. On April 15, Miz was drafted to Raw as part of the 2019 WWE Superstar Shake-up. Upon his acquisition, he would attack McMahon with a steel chair.\n\nSubsequently, Miz would challenge McMahon to a steel cage match at Money in the Bank in May. At the event, Miz was again narrowly defeated. The following month at Super ShowDown, Miz competed in the 51-man battle royal, but did not win.\n\nIn July, Miz restarted his feud with Dolph Ziggler after a confrontation on \"Miz TV\". A match between the two was arranged for SummerSlam, however during the contract signing on the August 5 episode of \"Raw\", Miz revealed that he was not Ziggler's opponent, instead it was the returning Goldberg who would take Miz's place in the match. He stated in an interview: “I’ll have many other opportunities at SummerSlam, but this might be Goldberg’s last.” On the \"Raw\" after SummerSlam, Miz defeated Ziggler to end their feud. Miz then competed in the 2019 King of the Ring, but was eliminated in the first round by Baron Corbin. Miz then unsuccessfully challenged for Shinsuke Nakamura's Intercontinental Championship at Clash of Champions in September, after interference from Nakamura's manager Sami Zayn.\n\nAs part of the 2019 draft, Miz was drafted to SmackDown. During the November 1 episode of \"SmackDown\", NXT wrestler Tommaso Ciampa disrupted an edition of \"Miz TV\" to air his grievances towards Miz, accusing him of being self-centered. He subsequently challenged Ciampa to a match, which he would lose via pinfall. The following month, Miz began a feud with Universal Champion Bray Wyatt, who, under his sinister alter ego \"The Fiend\", proclaimed he wanted to become part of Miz's family. He would later attack Miz backstage. Subsequently, a non-title match between Miz and Wyatt was arranged for the pay-per-view, which Miz lost. At Starrcade, The Miz faced Shinsuke Nakamura for the Intercontinental title in a losing effort.\n\nOn the January 3, 2020 episode of \"SmackDown\", Miz blindsided Kofi Kingston after being defeated in a match against him and subsequently lashed out at the audience after being booed, turning into a villain in the process. Later that night, he reunited with his former tag team partner John Morrison, who made his return to WWE. After winning a title shot on \"SmackDown\", Miz and Morrison won the SmackDown Tag Team Championship from The New Day at Super ShowDown. At Elimination Chamber on March 8, Miz and Morrison retained the championship over The New Day, The Usos, Heavy Machinery (Otis and Tucker), Lucha House Party (Gran Metalik and Lince Dorado) and Dolph Ziggler and Robert Roode in a tag yeam Elimination Chamber match. Miz and Morrison were originally set to defend the championship in a triple threat tag team ladder match against The New Day and The Usos at WrestleMania 36, but Miz pulled out of the event due to concerns arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, Morrison individually defended the championship in a triple threat ladder match against Kofi Kingston of The New Day and Jimmy Uso of The Usos, which Morrison won. On the April 17 episode of \"SmackDown\", the duo lost the titles back to The New Day after Miz unsuccessfully defended the titles by himself in a triple threat match against Big E and Jey Uso.\n\nThe Miz's finisher, per the reality TV and Hollywood tie-ins to his character, is a full nelson facebuster dubbed the \"Skull Crushing Finale\". He had also previously performed a running knee lift followed by a neckbreaker slam, named the \"Reality Check\", before abandoning it and adopting his current finisher in mid-2009.\n\nHaving been associated with Ric Flair, The Miz occasionally performs Flair's submission hold, the figure-four leg lock. Since his storyline with Daniel Bryan, The Miz incorporated several of Bryan's moves, like the \"Yes! Kicks\", which he nicknames the \"It Kicks\".\n\nAfter The Miz turned face in late-2012, his turn was not well received by critics, who commented that Miz as a fan favorite was too similar to his villainous character because he was \"still cocky, arrogant, and egotistical\" while \"pivoted toward calling out established heels\" (villains). Other criticisms were that Miz was \"juvenile\", lacking of depth, \"grating and not endearing to the audience\" and that \"there was not that moment when he officially turned and aligned his values with the audience's\".\n\nIn 2008, Miz made his first WWE video game appearance in \"WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009\" and appears in every WWE video game since, with his latest appearance being \"WWE 2K20\".\nIn 2012, Miz also appeared in the WWE Studios and Kare Prod project \"Les reines du ring\" (\"Queens of the Ring\"), alongside Eve Torres and CM Punk, and on \"MDA Show of Strength\" with Maryse and other celebrities. In March 2013, he attended the Kids Choice Awards with Maryse and The Rock.\nMizanin played a small role in the film \"The Campaign\" in 2012. In 2013, The Miz starred in WWE Studios film \"\", replacing fellow wrestler Randy Orton, who was dropped from the role due to his bad conduct discharge from the Marine Corps.\n\nMizanin starred in the ABC Family TV movie \"Christmas Bounty\", which premiered in December 2013. In 2015, he starred in the WWE Studios Christmas film \"Santa's Little Helper\".\n\nIn 2016, Mizanin guest-starred in \"Supernatural\" as a wrestler named Shawn Harley in an organization targeted by a demon.\n\nIn 2018, Mizanin and his wife Maryse starred in a reality-television series titled \"Miz & Mrs.\"\n\nMizanin married his longtime girlfriend, French-Canadian fellow WWE wrestler Maryse Ouellet, in The Bahamas on February 20, 2014. Their first daughter, Monroe Sky Mizanin, was born March 27, 2018. Shortly thereafter, the family moved to Austin, Texas. During Elimination Chamber on February 17, 2019 the couple announced that they were expecting their second child, due in September. In August 2019, the family moved permanently to Thousand Oaks, California. Their second daughter, Madison Jade Mizanin, was born September 20, 2019.\n\n"}

An EBA is formed where the distributions of two or more such restricted-range species overlap. Using this guideline, 218 EBAs were identified when Birdlife International established their Biodiversity project in 1987. A secondary EBA comprises the range of only one restricted-range species.\n\nEBAs contain about 93% of the world's restricted-range bird species, as well as supporting support many more widespread species. Half the restricted-range species are threatened or near-threatened, with the other half especially vulnerable to the loss or degradation of their habitats because of the small size of their ranges. Most EBAs are also important for the conservation of other animals and of plants. Although they cover less than 5% of the world's land surface, their biological richness makes them high priorities for ecosystem conservation. The natural habitat of most EBAs is forest, especially tropical lowland forest and highland cloud forest, often comprising islands or mountain ranges, and varying in size from a few square kilometres to over 100,000 km. Some 77% of EBAs lie in the tropics and subtropics.\n\nA restricted-range bird species is a term coined by BirdLife International in conjunction with the identification of Endemic Bird Areas. It is defined as a landbird (i.e. not a seabird) species which is estimated to have had a breeding range of not more than 50,000 km since 1800. It includes birds which have become extinct which qualify on the range criterion. It does not include birds which, although they meet the range criterion today, were historically (since 1800) more widespread.\n\n\n"}

It is the most powerful turboprop engine to enter service.\n\nThe design that eventually became the NK-12 turboprop was developed after World War II by a team of Russian scientists and deported German engineers under Ferdinand Brandner, who had worked for Junkers previously; the design bureau was headed by chief engineer Nikolai D. Kuznetsov. Thus, the NK-12 design evolved from late-war German turboprop studies. This started with the postwar development of the wartime Jumo 022 turboprop design that was designed to develop , weighing . The effort continued with a , weighing , completed by 1947.

In 1961, Anna Radziwiłł graduated from the faculty of history of the Warsaw University. Immediately after graduation, she started to work as a school teacher.\n\nIn 1967, she completed her studies and obtained the title of doctor of humanistic sciences for her study on \"Educational ideology of the Sanacja and its reflection in education policies of 1926-1939\". Her work was to be published the following year by the Polish Scientific Publishers PWN, but in 1968, after the anti-intelligentsia campaign of the communist authorities, it was banned by the censorship.\n\nShe continued to work as a teacher of history and Polish language in various Warsaw-based schools. At the same time, she published a number of studies, mostly on history of education in Poland after 1945. Most of them were banned and were published underground, outside of the official system. In the 1970s, she also started cooperation with various undergrounds opposition newspapers, including \"Więź\", \"Znak\", and \"Res Publica\".\n\nAfter the legalization of the Solidarity movement, Anna Radziwiłł became one of its advisers. As such, she took part in various conferences between the communist authorities and the democratic opposition. The exact effect of these consultations was a reform of history education in Polish schools. For that she was awarded with the Golden Cross of Merit in 1981. However, the reform was finally halted by the introduction of martial law.\n\nIn the underground, she started her work on various handbooks to Polish 20th century history. Some of them were published by the underground printing presses and were used by, among others, the so-called Flying University. After the democratic reforms of 1989 and the ousting of the communist authorities, Anna Radziwiłł was elected on 6 June 1989 to the Senate of Poland. She also assumed the post of a sub-secretary of state in the ministry of education in Tadeusz Mazowiecki's government.\n\nIn 1992, she resigned her post and returned to university studies.

Originally it was associated with the labour movement, but it soon realigned itself with traditional unionist politics.\n\nThe class tensions within the Orange Order flared into rebellion in 1902. At an unruly Belfast County demonstration in Castlereagh, Thomas Sloan, Worshipful Master of the Belfast Protestant Association, challenged the County Grand Master, Colonel Saunderson MP, to say how he voted on the 'Inspection of Convent Laundries' bill. As the title suggests, this piece of legislation was an attempt to embarrass and annoy the Catholic Church by requiring that its convents (which militant Protestants suspected of exploiting the labour and the sexuality of young girls) be subject to government inspection. The point Sloan wished to make was that Saunderson, like most Unionist leaders, had put government interest before anti-Catholic principle. Although popular enough to win the Belfast South Westminster seat previously held by Willian Johnston of Ballykilbegs (a Protestant hero since his prison sentence in 1867 for defying a parades ban) Sloan was disciplined by Grand Lodge for embarrassing a grandee and led a breakaway.\n\nIn the great Belfast Dock strike of 1907, the labour leader James Larkin was able to engage the support of Sloan and the independent Order. In 1903, Sloan had been the only Unionist MP to vote for the Miners' Eight Hour bill.\n\nLike the Orange Order it is a Protestant fraternal organisation dedicated to the principles of the Protestant Reformation. It takes its name in memory of King William of Orange of the house of Orange who fought at the Battle of the Boyne, brought about the Glorious Revolution and the Bill of Rights giving the Westminster parliament ultimate power of the country rather than the Monarch. The Independent Order is small compared to the main organisation with about 350–400 members.It is largely based around north County Antrim in Northern Ireland but has lodges around the world, including England, Scotland and Australia. Its annual main Twelfth of July demonstration is held in a north Antrim town or village.\n\nAlong with the Orange Order and the Royal Black Institution, the Independent Orange Order in 2006 held talks with the Social Democratic and Labour Party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), the Ulster Unionist Party, Alliance, the Chief Constable of the PSNI, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the Presbyterian and Methodist Churches, the Church of Ireland and the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission to try to resolve issues around contested loyalist parades. The Independent Orange Order was represented by Free Presbyterian minister David McConaghie, then a prominent figure in both the DUP and the Caleb Foundation, an evangelical pressure group. There was no meeting with Sinn Féin; McConaghie called on the IRA to apologise for the \"slaughter\" of 310 Orangemen who had been killed during the Troubles.\n\nThe annual Independent Orange Order demonstration on the Twelfth of July has in the past usually been addressed by Ian Paisley, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, although he is not a member. In 2012 the demonstration, held in Rasharkin, County Antrim, was led by McConaghie.\n\nThe first notable effect after the formation of the Independent Order was a more liberal interpretation of the rules of the \"old order.\" In the early years of the Institution many suffered the full wrath of the \"powers that be\", who were opposed to any splitting of the Orange Order. Jobs were lost, homes were burnt and their headquarters in Belfast bombed. Independent Orangemen believe that while the \"Old\" Order maintains what they see as its totalitarian laws, its political affiliation, and its \"spiritual weakness\", the \"principles of the Reformation\" will not be kept to the fore in its ranks.\n\nIndependent Orangeism today maintains that it is essential for the Orange Institution to be kept free from politics and to guard the principles of Reformation Protestantism. They often expressed alarm when they believed these principles were endangered by conciliatory politicians. They are opposed to ecumenism.\nWhile being opposed to Orangeism being linked to the Ulster Unionist Party they are not apolitical and tend to work alongside unionist politicians and parties.\n\nThe structure and size of the Order lends itself to good communication and disciplined action based on that communication. Thus they have been able to participate in strikes, days of action, and parade protests. On occasions lodges have been given area responsibility as part of an overall co-ordinated, disciplined and peaceful protest action.\n\nThe Institution also promotes Ulster Protestant history. This is most obvious during the Twelfth and other parades, but also involves lectures, tours of historic sites and commemorative publications.\n\nThe Institution proclaims the principle of \"Liberty of Conscience\". They declare their right to think and act independently without direction from political or clerical masters. They seek to strengthen the position of Orangeism. They often warn of the danger of the development of a social and cultural Orangeism devoid of Protestant principle.\n\nThey claim the support of all Protestants with their slogan:\n\nProtestantism, not politics\nPrinciples, not party \nMeasures, not men\n\nIndependent Orangemen believe that Protestantism is the religion of the Bible and the foundation of modern democracy.\n\nThe Independent Orange Institution possesses 3 degrees – the Orange, Plain Purple and the highly ritualistic Royal Arch Purple. The layout of the Independent Orange Institution degree system is outlined in the Independent Loyal Orange Institution 'candidate instruction' booklet which states: \"There are three degrees in the Institution, the first being the Orange...Upon receipt of the Plain Purple degree a member is entitled to hold office in his Private Lodge and to attend the meetings of District. The Royal Arch Purple degree is the longest and most detailed degree. A member who receives this degree can attend County and Imperial Grand Lodge meetings.\"\n\nThis degree, worked within the Independent Orange, is in essence the same as that employed by the Royal Arch Purple Chapter, although like any distinct organisation it has some slight differences.\n\n"}

Not long afterwards, his wife Frankie Baldwin (Debra Stephenson), who had previously cheated on him, arrives in Weatherfield as she wants to give their marriage another chance. They are soon joined by Danny's two sons, Warren Baldwin (Danny Young) and Jamie Baldwin (Rupert Hill). Unaware of Frankie's intentions, Danny has a brief fling with shop assistant Sunita Parekh (Shobna Gulati) shortly after his arrival, but Sunita does not know that Danny is married and is very hurt when Frankie turns up. The Baldwins then rent No. 7 Coronation Street from Blanche Hunt (Maggie Jones).\n\nDanny's father Harry has sex with his mother, Viv, (Patricia Brake), comes to stay and reveals to Mike and Danny a secret she had kept since his birth. Mike is actually Danny's biological father, the product of an affair she had with Mike. Danny's uncle Harry had brought him up believing him to be his own son. Danny embarks on a passionate affair with Jamie's girlfriend Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson). When this is finally revealed, Jamie is heartbroken. Frankie throws Danny out and he moves in with Leanne.\n\nMike becomes ill with Alzheimer's disease. Danny is initially determined to use Mike's illness to gain control of the factory and Mike's other assets and manages to get power of attorney but as his condition deteriorates, Danny's emotions get the better of him and he is genuinely upset at the decline of his dad. Mike's death in April 2006, hits Danny hard. Leanne, now engaged to Danny, finds a more recent will amongst Mike's belongings in which he leaves everything to his youngest son, Adam Barlow (Sam Robertson). Leanne uses the will to blackmail Danny, demanding £100,000 and leaves Weatherfield after Danny throws her out. Danny continues to try to reconcile with Frankie, and nearly succeeds; but is shocked and appalled to discover that Frankie is having an affair with Jamie. Danny goes on a downwards spiral, sells his share of the factory to Paul Connor (Sean Gallagher) who had already bought Adam's share, and leaves Weatherfield for Spain. He is last seen with a beautiful woman on his arm, where he phones Jamie to wish him a Happy New Year.\n\nIn an interview with Chris Evans on OFI Sunday on 11 December 2005, Bradley Walsh revealed that the character was originally to have been called \"Vic Baldwin\", but that he asked the producers if the name could be changed to that of his own father, who had recently died.\n"}

She was introduced as part of the Baldwin family along with Danny Baldwin (Bradley Walsh), Jamie Baldwin (Rupert Hill) and Warren Baldwin (Danny Young). She made her first appearance during the episode airing on 6 June 2004. Stephenson quit the role in 2006 and Frankie departed on screen on 31 December 2006.\n\nGlamorous Frankie met her husband Danny (Bradley Walsh) when she worked as a babysitter for his son Jamie (Rupert Hill). Even though he was still married to his first wife Carol, Frankie could not resist sleeping with Danny, as she had fallen in love with him. They had a son of their own, Warren (Danny Young), and she also became close to her stepson Jamie after she married Danny. He cheated on her numerous times, but she continued to forgive him until he cheated on her with Jamie's girlfriend Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson).\n\nUpon entering Weatherfield, Frankie appeared stuck up and prissy, eager for Danny to sell the house they shared in London so they could move into somewhere more suitable. Frankie exploded when she discovered Danny had slept with Sunita Parekh (Shobna Gulati), and declared war on her. This perhaps is what drew her to Sunita's nemesis Maya Sharma (Sasha Behar). However, after learning of Maya's true nature, she apologised to Sunita and forgave her.\n\nAfter a while, Frankie began to settle into the street more - especially after striking up a bond with Vera Duckworth (Liz Dawn). When Vera was ill, Frankie took care of her by doing her chores for her, filling in her job for her and advised her husband Jack (Bill Tarmey) to be more sensitive and attentive to Vera's needs. This led to Frankie securing a permanent position at the cafe, where she works with enemy Leanne.\n\nFrankie saw Leanne as not worthy for Jamie, and became suspicious of her cheating on him. Frankie discovered Leanne's affair with her husband Danny when Leanne lost her phone. Leanne and Danny had arranged to meet at a hotel but Leanne cancelled at the last minute. Annoyed, Danny rang her phone and said all the things he wanted to do to Leanne - not aware that Frankie was on the other end of the line. Frankie chucked Danny out and from then on she lived with Jamie, and Jamie's mother Carol (Lynne Pearson). But after Carol accused Frankie and Jamie of sleeping with each other, Frankie kicked Carol out, and Carol left the street for good.\n\nDanny, regretting losing her and scared at the thought of spending the rest of his life with Leanne, begged Frankie to take him back. Frankie remained strong and the divorce went ahead, with Frankie moving boyfriend Nathan in just days before. She celebrated her divorce by jetting off alone for a holiday in her newly acquired Villa in Spain.\n\nIn October 2006 Frankie's former stepson Jamie declared his love for her at Fred Elliott's (John Savident) funeral and they kissed but the revelation shocked her and drove her back into the arms of ex-husband Danny. However she couldn't resist Jamie's advances and they embarked on a relationship, much to the disgust of the other residents of the street. The news also led to Danny disappearing.\n\nFrankie and Jamie decided to head to Spain to start afresh, but at the last minute on New Year's Eve 2006, Frankie got cold feet. She ended it with a devastated Jamie, and left to stay with a friend in Essex. As she departed in a taxi, Jamie was consoled by friend Sean Tully (Antony Cotton). But the misery wasn't over - at midnight Jamie received a call from father, Danny, telling him he had sold the flat and he was \"sorry\" to hear about his break up with Frankie.\n\nIn 2009, Roy (David Neilson) and Hayley Cropper (Julie Hesmondhalgh) are invited to Frankie's wedding to a footballer in \"\", but they arrive a week late. Frankie lets them stay in her villa while she is honeymooning.\n\nOn 6 May 2004, it was announced that former \"Bad Girls\" actress Debra Stephenson had joined \"Coronation Street\" as Frankie.\n\nOne storyline in 2005 saw Frankie's husband Danny have an affair with Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson). Frankie later discovered the affair when she answers Leanne's mobile and finds her husband is on the other end. Danny had organised to spend another night with Leanne holed-up in a hotel room. When Leanne doesn't show, Danny rings her to find out where she is, but he does not realise it's his wife answering the phone. Seeing her husband's name come up on the mobile, Frankie has answered, and mimicked Leanne's voice. Danny, who has told his wife he is away on business, says he has booked the best hotel room. Frankie tells him: \"It's not Leanne, it's me,\" and orders Danny to come home. Frankie kept the affair secret in order to protect Danny's son Jamie (Rupert Hill).\n\nOn 14 May 2006, it was announced that Stephenson had quit her role as Frankie. Stephenson said: \"I had originally only planned to stay for two years but I didn't anticipate how much I would enjoy playing Frankie. I'm also keen to pursue other acting projects and I'm very excited about what the future holds.\" A \"Coronation Street\" spokeswoman said: \"Debra has been a great asset to the show and her portrayal of Frankie Baldwin has been fantastic.

He was elected from South Carolina in both the Continental Congress and the U.S. House. He later was appointed as Treasurer of the United States and served from 1801 to his death in 1828, establishing a record as the longest-serving Treasurer.\n\nThomas was born in St. George's, Bermuda to a family prominent in that colony since his ancestors immigrated from England in 1662. His parents were Henry (1713–1785) and Ann Tucker. As a youth, Thomas studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. After graduating in 1770, he moved first to Virginia in the 1760s, then settled in Charleston, South Carolina (which had been settled from Bermuda in 1670, under the leadership of William Sayle, and which had a large community of expatriate Bermudians) and opened a practice. His younger brother St. George Tucker followed him to Virginia, studying law and eventually being appointed as Chief Justice of the Virginia Supreme Court.\n\nTucker was an early supporter of the cause of American independence. He was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives in 1776, and served there in various years until 1788. In 1781 he joined the Continental Army as a hospital surgeon supporting the Southern Department, and served until 1783. South Carolina sent him as a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1787 and again in 1788. He is believed to have played a key role in a plot to supply the rebel army with gunpowder stolen from a British magazine in his Bermudian homeland.\n\nIn 1775, after the Battle of Lexington, the Continental Congress announced a trade embargo against British colonies remaining loyal to the Crown. Bermuda, with its control of the Turks Islands, and a large merchant fleet, offered to supply the Patriots with salt, but they were unimpressed and asked for gunpowder. Meanwhile, in June 1775, the fiercely loyal Governor of Bermuda, George James Bruere, who had lost one of his sons, John, who was killed fighting on the British side at the Battle of Bunker Hill, was enraged when, on 14 August, Bermudians sympathetic to the Revolution stole the island's supply of gunpowder from the Powder Magazine in St George's and shipped it to the rebels. Trade with Bermuda developed, for which Bruere was not blamed in London.\n\nThis was despite the implication of his Bermudian relatives in the act of treason. The President of the Governor's Council, and occasional acting Governor of Bermuda, was Bruere's son-in-law, Henry Tucker, who was Thomas T. Tucker's older brother. Most notably, among other prominent Bermudians, their father, a Colonel of the Militia, as well as their brother, St. George Tucker, were believed to have been involved in organising the theft. Thomas Tudor Tucker is believed to have suggested that George Washington write the letter, addressed to the people of Bermuda, which had sparked the act of treason, and that it had been delivered into the hands of his relatives in Bermuda. The plot was organised by persons highly-enough placed that no one was ever prosecuted.\n\nThe letter from Washington had read:\n\nTucker was opposed to the United States Constitution, believing that it gave too much authority to the central government. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives and served in the first two congresses from 1789 until 1793.\n\nOn December 1, 1801 President Jefferson appointed Tucker as Treasurer of the United States. He held that post through four administrations (Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, and J.Q. Adams), serving until his death in 1828. Tucker holds the record as the longest-serving Treasurer: 26 years, 153 days. During this time, he also served as physician to President Madison (1809–1817).\n\nTucker died while in office at Washington, D.C. and is buried in the Congressional Cemetery. His nephew, Henry St. George Tucker, Sr., was a U.S. Congressman from Virginia. His nephew Thomas Tudor Tucker stayed with the Bermuda branch of the family and served as an admiral in the British Navy.\n\nTucker published an oration that was delivered in Charleston before the South Carolina Society of the Cincinnati (Charleston, 1795).\n\n"}

He came to the United States as a young man after starting as a designer in Rome, and quickly got work with Paramount Pictures. Cassini established his reputation by designing for films.\n\nHe became particularly well known as a designer for Jacqueline Kennedy while she was First Lady of the United States. The \"Jackie Look\" was to become highly influential and much admired. Among Cassini's inspirations were sports and Native American culture.\n\nHe was born in Paris as Oleg Aleksandrovich Loiewski, the elder son of Countess Marguerite Cassini and her husband Count Alexander Loiewski, a Russian diplomat, thereby obtaining the title of Count. His maternal grandfather Arthur Paul Nicholas Cassini, Marquis de Capuzzuchi di Bologna, Count Cassini, had been the Russian ambassador to the United States during the administrations of William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt. Count Arthur Cassini signed the Treaty ending the war between Japan and China. His mother's family claimed Italian astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini as an ancestor. In 1918, the Russian Revolution caused the Loiewski family to flee for their lives, leaving behind their wealth, lands, and homes. As a young child, Oleg saw his cousin shot to death. The family reached Denmark and next moved to Switzerland. The Greek Royal family invited them to Greece, but, while traveling through Italy, revolution began in Greece as well. They got off the train in Florence, eventually settling there. In Italy the children started using the surname of Cassini.\n\nIn his early youth, Cassini suffered a major accident, almost losing his leg. He spent much of a year in bed in recovery, during which time he studied history and read extensively, including authors such as American James Fenimore Cooper. He developed a love of history and the mysticism of Native American tribes. He also discovered American culture through the movies from the United States that were shown in Italy.\n\nWhen he started school, Oleg had to learn Italian, but he already knew Russian, French and Danish. His mother, Marguerite Cassini, founded her fashion house in Florence, gaining American clients from people she knew in Washington, D.C., as the daughter of the Count Arthur Cassini.\n\nCassini played soccer with the teenage team, the \"Boys\" of Fiorentina, and was on the university track and ski teams. He also played tennis for the Italian Jr. Davis Cup team, becoming Italian Jr. Champion.\n\nCassini studied Political Science at the University of Florence and became an accomplished equestrian. He studied fine art under painter Giorgio de Chirico at the Accademia di Belle Arti Firenze. Eventually he started in fashion, studying under the French couturier, Jean Patou. Cassini won a number of international fashion competitions in Turin, including five first prizes in Mostra Della Moda for sketches and Most Creative Presentation for an evening dress painted in dramatic colors on silver foil, garnering a prize of 5,000 lire. Cassini opened his own boutique in Rome and designed for the local film industry as well as Roman society.\n\nOleg became engaged to a debutante in Rome, Anna Donnina Toeplitz, and subsequently left for America after winning a duel. He sailed to America on the \"Saturnia\" and arrived in New York on Christmas Day 1936. His autobiography describes his possessions upon arrival in America as being limited to a tuxedo, two tennis rackets, a title, and talent. He briefly worked as a political cartoonist in Washington, D.C., upon his arrival prior to traveling to Hollywood.\n\nUpon arriving in California, Cassini began playing tennis at the West Side Tennis Club. After he competed in and won a doubles tournament, his partner introduced himself as the head of Paramount Pictures, saying he was \"looking for another designer\". Cassini went to the studio the next day and got the job as a full designer for Paramount Pictures. In 1941, his first film was \"I Wanted Wings\", for which he created the look for its star, newcomer Veronica Lake.\n\nCassini designed costumes for films including \"The Shanghai Gesture\" (1941), starring Gene Tierney, \"Tales of Manhattan\" (1942) for Rita Hayworth, \"The Razor's Edge\" (1946), \"It's a Joke Son!\" (1947), \"Born to Speed\" (1947), \"Lost Honeymoon\" (1947), \"The Ghost and Mrs. Muir\" (1947), \"That Wonderful Urge\" (1948), \"Whirlpool\" (1949), \"Night and the City\" (1950), \"Where the Sidewalk Ends\" (1950), as well as \"The Mating Season\", \"Close to My Heart\", \"On the Riviera\" (all 1951), \"Rampage\" (1963), \"The Tammy Grimes Show\" (1966), \"The Day Dreamer\" (1966), \"Peligro ... ! Mujeres en acción\", (1967), \"The Ambushers\" (1967) for Dean Martin, \"SOS Conspiracion Bikini\" (1967), \"The Sentinel\" (2006) for Kim Basinger, and \"Say It in Russian\" (2007) for Faye Dunaway.\n\nHis designs are worn in the climactic scene of \"Meet Joe Black\" (1998) and throughout \"Ready or Not\" (2009). He worked for the major film studios and dressed numerous stars over the course of his career including Audrey Hepburn, Shirley Temple, Anita Ekberg, Janet Leigh, Loretta Young, Rita Hayworth, Betty Grable, Joan Crawford, Marilyn Monroe, Natalie Wood, Ursula Andress, Jayne Mansfield, Lana Turner, Sandra Dee, Suzy Parker, Gina Lollobrigida, Renée Zellweger, Malin Åkerman, Kim Basinger, Carroll Baker and Taylor Swift.\n\nAfter the attack on Pearl Harbor, Cassini quickly enlisted in the war effort. Initially, he joined the United States Coast Guard, but he later served in the U.S. Army as a cavalry officer. He reached the rank of 1st Lieutenant. Cassini became a United States citizen (in December 1941/January 1942, losing his titles of nobility); he was commissioned as a First Lieutenant at Fort Riley, Kansas. After serving five years in the U.S. Cavalry, Cassini moved to New York City in 1952 to open his own fashion house on Seventh Avenue, the center of the fashion industry.\n\nAfter the war, Cassini designed ready-to-wear dresses while continuing to design for television, motion pictures, and Broadway theatre. According to his autobiography, Jack L. Warner offered Cassini the position of head of design for Warner Bros. Studios proclaiming, \"You're better than Errol Flynn\". He remained in New York rather than work with Warner Brothers and opened his own designer brand. Cassini had enough money to launch one line, his first Collection, which was received with rave reviews.\n\nThe head of Lord & Taylor, Dorothy Shaver, provided the Oleg Cassini Collection the entirety of the store's Fifth Avenue store front windows to launch the collection. Cassini also took his designs \"on the road\" to his customers in trunk shows and special fashion events in order to promote the new lines. The in store events evolved into the emerging medium of television and Cassini displayed his product on Steve Allen, Jack Paar, Dinah Shore, Phil Donahue, and \"Good Morning America\". \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\" provided nightly recognition as Carson had a line designed for him by Cassini, which he wore exclusively for the show.\n\nHis reputation developed as a result of his genius for original spontaneous design and in 1953, shortly before her marriage to John Kennedy, Cassini met Jacqueline Bouvier, named by his brother, society columnist Cholly Knickerbocker as \"Queen Deb of the Year\" in 1947.\n\nCassini's appointment by Jacqueline Kennedy as her exclusive couturier in 1961 dubbed him her \"Secretary of Style\" and provided him a position of prestige. \"We are on the threshold of a new American elegance thanks to Mrs. Kennedy's beauty, naturalness, understatement, exposure and symbolism,\" Cassini said when his selection as the couturier to shape the entire look of the First Lady was announced.\n\nUtilizing the technique and high fashion fabrics of French couture, Cassini's unique designs for Jacqueline Kennedy ushered in a new era of timeless simplicity based on clean lines and crisp forms and opulent and luxurious fabrics. Cassini brought American design to the world stage as the First Lady's identity became synonymous with sophistication and taste. The \"Jackie look\" that he created was copied by women all over the world. Cassini visualized her as an American Queen and Mrs. Kennedy acknowledged that \"Oleg dressed me for the part\".\n\nThe publicity Cassini derived from his work for Mrs. Kennedy led women from 18 to 80 to copy the look of simple, geometric dresses in sumptuous fabrics and pillbox hats with an elegant coiffure. Meticulously tailored and featuring oversized buttons and boxy jackets, as well as occasionally dramatic décolletage. Cassini designed a reported 300 outfits for the First Lady, including a much-copied coat made of leopard pelts and a Swiss double satin white gown decorated by a single cocarde which she wore to the Inaugural Gala Ball in 1961. This was Mrs. Kennedy's first official appearance as First Lady Elect. The dress was subsequently named one of the \"50 Dresses that Changed the World\" by the Design Museum in England.\n\nIn 1961, Eugenia Sheppard announced in the \"New York Herald Tribune\", \"According to Tobe's most recent coast to coast survey, the best known name in American fashion is Oleg Cassini.\"\n\nCassini became known primarily for his licensing agreements.

Outside, striping, rub rails, wheel covers and a crest mark the Matador as Cassini's. He helped promote the car in AMC's advertising. The special Oleg Cassini Matador was positioned in the popular and highly competitive \"personal luxury car\" market segment. The \"distinctive\" styling of the Cassini \"designer editions\" merit collector interest\n\nIn 1960, with his younger brother, society columnist Igor, Oleg opened Le Club in Manhattan, which becomes a leading private club with such members as Gianni Agnelli, Stavros Niarchos, Aristotle Onassis, and Ray Stark. In 1960 Oleg Cassini was named personal couturier by Mrs. Kennedy, launching the Jackie look in 1961. He was awarded the Chicago Gold Coast Award for Excellence in Design. In 1962, he was awarded the National Cystic Fibrosis Distinguished Service Citation. In 1967, he created deep tonal shirts for men adding special colors where there had only been white. The sales of dress shirts rose dramatically, and the look was launched on \"The Tonight Show\", Starring Johnny Carson. Oleg created the \"Johnny Carson\" line of Men's wear. In 1968, the Peacock Revolution is hailed by Newsweek, wherein Cassini is credited with leading a revolution in men's fashion worldwide. The \"Competitors\" Collection menswear campaign was also launched by Cassini. It featured icons of sport wearing Cassini including: Ted Turner for sailing, Bob Hope and Raymond Floyd for golf, Michael Jordan for basketball, Mario Andretti for racing, Gary Carter for baseball, Lynn Swann and Lawrence Taylor for football and Charlton Heston, Regis Philbin, and Kenny Rogers for tennis.\n\nIn 2003 The Council of Fashion Designers of America Board of Directors noted Cassini's extraordinary design achievements with their first ever, Board of Directors Special Tribute. The presentation was made to Oleg by President Stan Herman and Diane von Furstenberg.\n\nIn 2003, Cassini was crowned King of the Beaux Arts Ball.\n\nOleg Cassini excelled at tennis and competed seriously since his early days as a ranked Italian Junior Davis Cup player. His skill at tennis led to a fortuitous design connection. Recounted in his autobiography, newly arrived in Hollywood, Cassini played tennis at the prestigious West Side Tennis Club which led to a doubles game with the head of Paramount Pictures. Decades later, Cassini also created collections of printed and multi color tennis wear, bringing 'color to the court'. He is noted for having outfitted the US Davis Cup team and for participating in celebrity pro-am tournaments such as the Alan King Tournament in Las Vegas. Cassini also participated and won the 5th Annual RFK Pro Celebrity Tennis Tournament in 1976. The silver winner's cup was presented to him personally by Jackie Kennedy Onassis.\n\nCassini competed professionally in the sport of harness racing. In 1985 he earned a professional harness racer license and won races at the Meadowlands Raceway, Yonkers Raceway, Freehold Raceway, Monticello Raceway, and Roosevelt Raceway. He received awards in recognition of his efforts to support equine charities from \"HORSE\" and \"The Equine Society\" which recognized Cassini with its Man of the year award. He participated in golfing events, scoring three holes in one at the Deepdale Golf Club and one hole in one at the Westhampton Golf Club. Cassini also participated in the ABC TV Superstars Competition.\n\nOleg Cassini received the James Herriot Award (\"All Creatures Great and Small\") as the Man of the Year from the Humane Society of the United States for his work and care for animals. He created collections of manmade fashion fur, the 'evolutionary furs'.\n\nIn 1999, he was awarded the Humanitarian Award at a fashion show and Gala at the National Building Museum in Washington, DC, honorary chairpersons Eunice Shriver and Senator Ted Kennedy, show hosted by Montel Williams. Among the 40 models were movie star Tippi Hedren. In his own words \"What we're designing is as elegant and attractive as fur and eliminates the enormous cruelty that goes on in the killing of animals for fur.\" \n\nIn his autobiography Cassini claims to have suggested to President Kennedy that he take steps to organize The Bureau of Indian Affairs, the action which led to the American Indian Movement. Cassini was named an honorary member of the Chickasaw and Navajo nations in 1981 due to his fund raising and organization of gala charity events for the tribes. Cassini and his brother, Igor under the pen name of society columnist Cholly Knickerbocker, threw \"The Knickerbocker Charity Balls\" to raise money for the tribes.\n\nAn author of best-selling books, \"In My Own Fashion\", \"A Thousand Days of Magic: Dressing Jacqueline Kennedy for the White House\" a book which is a tribute to Jacqueline Kennedy and reflects the magical period of Camelot and the \"Jackie Look\", and \"Oleg Cassini: The Wedding Dress\". Cassini appeared on hundreds of television shows worldwide in many languages and also hosted a special 13-part TV series, \"Conversations with Cassini\", on the Arts & Entertainment Network.\n\nOn 2 September 1938, in Elkton, Maryland, Cassini became the husband of Mary \"Merry\" Fahrney (1910-1974). The couple divorced in 1940. Cassini married actress Gene Tierney, on 2 June 1941. Their daughter, Antoinette Daria, was born on 15 October 1943 blind, deaf and with severe brain damage. She died on 11 September 2010. The couple separated on 20 October 1946, and entered into a property settlement agreement on 10 November 1946 in which Cassini's fifty percent share of the marital estate was dedicated to the ongoing care of Daria. Tierney won an uncontested divorce in California on 13 March 1947, and the divorce would have been finalized one year later, on 13 March 1948. However, according to Cassini's diary, they reconciled some months before that. They announced that they were back together in April 1948. Gossip columnist Hedda Hopper reported the news in the \"Los Angeles Times\" on 9 April 1948. They finally divorced in 1953. Christina \"Tina\" was born on 19 November 1948. \n\nAfter his divorce from Gene Tierney, Cassini dated and was engaged to Grace Kelly. He and Tierney remained cordial until her 1991 death, when she bequeathed one dollar to her daughter Daria and the residue to Christina. In 1971, Cassini married Marianne Nestor, at the time a cover girl of 250 international fashion magazines including Redbook. Beginning in 1971, Marianne operated the licensing and public relations portion of the brand, which they famously defended. Their marriage was kept secret until after his death; Marianne and his daughter Tina engaged in a bitter court battle over the estate. The status of that struggle was updated in an article in Vanity Fair in 2010. Christina died in 2015. A piece in Newsday, updated in September 2018 updated the history of the legal battle; at the time Marianne was in jail for refusing to comply with a court order. Cassini's estate was auctioned by Doyle in June 2019.\n\nOleg Cassini died from complications of an aneurysm in Manhasset, New York, in 2006. He is survived by his wife, Marianne.\n\n"}

It was built in 1924 by local theater owner Joseph Barnett and houses the Sunshine Theater as well as commercial space and offices. The Sunshine operated primarily as a movie theater until the 1980s, though it was also equipped for Vaudeville shows and other live performances. Since 1990 it has operated as a live music venue, hosting many notable acts. The building was listed on the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties in 1985 and is also an Albuquerque City Landmark.\n\nThe building was designed by the El Paso firm of Trost & Trost and is of reinforced concrete construction with a facade of yellow brick. The architectural style is Renaissance Revival. The building was known for having what was believed to be the last manually operated elevator in New Mexico.\n\nOne of the building's longest running commercial tenants was F. D. Fogg and Company, a local jeweler which operated there from 1948 to 1985. The company closed in 2004 after 83 years in business.\n\nThe TV Show \"In Plain Sight\" filmed the exterior of this location, as the fictional office of the US Marshals' Witness Protection Service.\n\nThe Sunshine Building was built in 1923–24 by Joseph Barnett (1866–1954), an Italian-American businessman who arrived in Albuquerque penniless in 1896 and worked his way up through the saloon and theater business to become one of the city's largest property owners. By the 1920s, Barnett already owned two theaters in the city, the B at 200 West Central and the Lyric at 312 West Central, but planned an even larger one for his new building along with five floors of offices. The building was constructed on the former site of the White Elephant building, a two-story adobe structure dating to 1881 which once housed a popular gambling hall and saloon. The Sunshine Building was designed by the El Paso firm of Trost & Trost, which was also responsible for several other buildings in the immediate area including the Rosenwald Building, Occidental Life Building, and First National Bank Building.\n\nThe Sunshine Theater opened on May 1, 1924, with a showing of the Ramón Novarro film \"Scaramouche\". With a seating capacity of 1,200, central heating and cooling, and fireproof reinforced concrete construction, it was advertised as \"the most modern and beautiful theater in the southwest\" and was considered Albuquerque's first movie palace. The \"Albuquerque Journal\" reported that the opening was a \"grand success\" with the theater filled to capacity for multiple showings. The theater was equipped for both films and live performances, including the traveling Vaudeville shows that were popular in the 1920s. The building also contained 73 office rooms on the upper stories and five ground-floor commercial spaces.\n\nIn 1935, Barnett merged his theater interests with those of the Bachechi family, including the KiMo Theater, which put most of Albuquerque's theaters under the same ownership. By 1952, the chain, Albuquerque Exhibitors, controlled 10 local theaters and had 170 employees. The company leased its theaters in 1956 to the Texas-based Frontier Theaters chain, which was taken over by Commonwealth Theaters in 1967. Commonwealth chose not to renew its lease on the Sunshine when the original lease expired in 1974, citing a lack of customers, and the theater stopped showing first-run films. Later it switched to classic 1930s and 1940s movies, then Spanish-language films.\n\nIn 1983, the Sunshine Building was proposed for demolition in order to build a \"Festival Marketplace\" development. Supporters of the project believed it would revitalize the mostly vacant area around First and Central, while preservationists opposed the demolition and organized a \"Save the Sunshine\" committee. The debate was reported in the National Trust for Historic Preservation's national \"Preservation News\" publication in 1984. Ultimately, the project was abandoned. In 1990, the Sunshine Theater was converted into a live music venue. One of the first acts to perform there was Soundgarden (mistakenly identified as \"Sound Garden\" in the local press) on February 14, 1990. The theater has remained one of Albuquerque's most popular mid-size concert venues and continues to host live music as of 2019.\n\nThe Sunshine Building is a six-story, concrete-framed structure at the southeast corner of Second Street and Central Avenue. The building is tall and has a footprint of . It is faced with marble on the ground floor and yellow brick on the upper levels. The architecture is usually identified as Renaissance Revival, with decorative brickwork and pilasters, a heavy cornice, and a balustraded parapet. The building is further decorated with swags, medallions, and other ornaments. Like the nearby First National Bank Building, the Sunshine Building was constructed with blank walls on two sides to accommodate neighboring structures. By the time of the 1980s Festival Marketplace controversy, the building was the only structure left on the block and its detractors criticized the \"not so handsome\" wall greeting traffic entering Downtown. In 2001, the Century Theatres Downtown building was built next to the Sunshine, obscuring the blank walls.\n\nThe building has ground-floor commercial space and five floors of offices wrapped around the central theater space. In its original configuration, the theater had 800 orchestra seats and 400 balcony seats, though most of the seating was removed when it was converted for live music use. The proscenium arch is wide by high, and the fly gallery has a height of from the stage to the grid deck. The balcony is reached from staircases on either side of the theater, with a mezzanine containing restrooms. The office section has a separate entrance lobby opening onto Second Street. The building was notable for having what was believed to be the last manually operated elevator in New Mexico, which was staffed by elevator operators until at least 1989.\n\nThe Sunshine Theater, which occupies a significant portion of the building, operated as a movie theater from 1924 until the 1980s and has since been remodeled into a popular live music venue. The Sunshine Theater has hosted a number of notable acts such as The Strokes, Snoop Dogg, Deltron 3030, Stone Temple Pilots, The Smashing Pumpkins, Queens of the Stone Age, The Dead Weather, Arctic Monkeys, Modest Mouse, Rancid, Coheed and Cambria, Awolnation, Cannibal Corpse, Ratatat, Social Distortion, Pennywise, Hollywood Undead, Deftones, Nightwish, Melanie Martinez, Damian Marley and Deadmau5 among others. The Sunshine Theater's set up is an open floor, a large balcony, and a bar that seats a 21 and older audience, in all they accommodate about 1,000 people. The theater is the most popular venue in the Albuquerque metro area to accommodate smaller but still notable acts, many with five or more shows in one month.\n\n"}
{"id": "2162339", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2162339", "title": "The Twelfth", "text": "The Twelfth\n\nThe Twelfth (also called the Glorious Twelfth or Orangemen's Day) is an Ulster Protestant celebration held on 12 July. It was first held in the late 18th century in Ulster. It celebrates the Glorious Revolution (1688) and victory of Protestant King William of Orange over Catholic King James II at the Battle of the Boyne (1690), which began the Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland. \n\nOn and around the Twelfth, large parades are held by the Orange Order and Ulster loyalist marching bands, streets are bedecked with British flags and bunting, and large towering bonfires are lit. Today the Twelfth is mainly celebrated in Ulster (especially in Northern Ireland, where it is a public holiday), but smaller celebrations are held in other parts of the world where Orange lodges have been set up. The Twelfth involves thousands of participants and spectators.\n\nIn Ulster, where about half the population is from a Protestant background and half from a Catholic background, the Twelfth has been accompanied by violence since its beginning. Many Catholics and Irish nationalists see the Orange Order and its marches as sectarian, triumphalist and supremacist. The Order is also politically a unionist/loyalist organisation. Violence related to the Twelfth in Northern Ireland worsened during the 30-year ethno-political conflict known as the Troubles. The Drumcree conflict is the most well-known dispute involving Orange marches. \n\nAttempts have recently been made to downplay the political aspects of the marches and present the Twelfth as a cultural, family-friendly event at which tourists are welcome. The majority of events pass off peacefully, however, there is a small contingency who occasionally stir up trouble.\n\nWhen 12 July falls on a Sunday, the parades are held on the 13th instead.\n\nOrangemen commemorated several events dating from the 17th century onwards, celebrating the continued dominance of Protestantism in Ireland after the Irish Rebellion of 1641 and triumph in the Williamite War in Ireland (1689–91). Early celebrations were 23 October, the anniversary of the 1641 rebellion (an attempted coup d'état by Catholic gentry who tried to seize control of the English administration in Ireland); and 4 November, the birthday of William of Orange, Protestant victor of the Williamite war in the 1690s. Both of these anniversaries faded in popularity by the end of the 18th century.\n\nThe Twelfth itself originated as a celebration of the Battle of Aughrim, which took place on 12 July 1691 in the 'Old Style' (O.S.) Julian calendar then in use. Aughrim was the decisive battle of the Williamite war, in which the predominantly Irish Catholic Jacobite army was destroyed and the remainder capitulated at Limerick, whereas the Boyne was less decisive. The Twelfth in the early 18th century was a popular commemoration of Aughrim, featuring bonfires and parades. The Battle of the Boyne (fought on 1 July 1690) was commemorated with smaller parades on 1 July. However, the two events were combined in the late 18th century. The first reason for this was the British switch to the Gregorian calendar in 1752, which repositioned the nominal date of the Battle of the Boyne to 11 July New Style (N.S.) (with the Battle of Aughrim nominally repositioned to 23 July N.S.). The second reason was the foundation of the Orange Order in 1795. The Order preferred the Boyne, due to William of Orange's presence there. It has also been suggested that in the 1790s (a time of Roman Catholic resurgence) the Boyne, where the Jacobites were routed, was more appealing to the Order than Aughrim, where they had fought hard and died in great numbers.\n\nThe Order's first marches took place on 12 July 1796 in Portadown, Lurgan and Waringstown. The Twelfth parades of the early 19th century often led to public disorder, so much so that the Orange Order and the Twelfth were banned in the 1830s and 40s (see below).\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the Twelfth, Orange Order and other Ulster loyalist marching bands hold numerous parades in Northern Ireland. The most common of these are lodge parades, in which one Orange lodge marches with one band. Others, such as the \"mini-Twelfth\" at the start of July, involve several lodges.\n\nFrom June to August, Protestant, unionist areas of Northern Ireland are bedecked with flags and bunting, which are usually flown from lamp-posts and houses. The most common flags flown are the Union Jack and Ulster Banner. Kerbstones may be painted red, white and blue and murals may be made. Steel or wooden arches, bedecked with flags and Orange symbolism, are raised over certain streets. These 'Orange arches' are inspired by triumphal arches.\n\nAs well as the Union Jack and Ulster Banner, the flags of illegal loyalist paramilitary groups—such as the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and Ulster Defence Association (UDA)—are flown in some areas. The raising of these flags near Catholic/Irish nationalist neighbourhoods, or in \"neutral\" areas, often leads to tension and sometimes violence. It is seen as deliberately provocative and intimidating.\n\nOn the night before The Twelfth—the \"Eleventh Night\"—huge towering bonfires are lit in many Protestant unionist neighbourhoods in Northern Ireland. In many of these areas the bonfires are family-friendly community celebrations. However, not all Protestants attend the bonfires and most Catholics avoid them. They have been condemned for displays of sectarian and ethnic hatred, anti-social behaviour, and for the damage and pollution caused by the fires. The flag of the Republic of Ireland, Irish nationalist symbols, Catholic symbols, and effigies, are usually burnt on the fires. More recently, symbols of the large Polish immigrant community have been burnt on the fires, which the Polish Association of Northern Ireland has described as \"racist intimidation\". Loyalist paramilitaries have also used the event to hold \"shows of strength\", in which masked gunmen fire volleys of shots into the air and petrol bombs used to light the bonfire. However, in recent years, there have been attempts to make the bonfires more family-friendly and environmentally-friendly.\n\nThe main way in which the Twelfth is celebrated is through large parades involving Orangemen and supporting bands. Most of the parades are in Ulster, almost exclusively being held in Northern Ireland and County Donegal, although Orange lodges elsewhere often hold parades as well. The parade usually begins at an Orange Hall, proceeds through the town or city and out to a large park or field where the marchers, their friends and family, and the general public gather to eat, drink and listen to speeches by clergymen, politicians and senior members of the Order. In the past the Twelfth has been a major venue for discussion of political issues. A church service will also be held and sometimes band prizes will be awarded. Within Northern Ireland, each District Lodge usually organises its own parade. In rural districts the parade will rotate around various towns, sometimes favouring those in which there is less likely to be trouble, but in other years choosing those in which it is felt the 'right to march' needs to be defended.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, there is a long tradition of Protestant and loyalist marching bands, which can be found in most towns. The Orangemen hire these bands to march with them on the Twelfth. An instrument almost unique to these marches is the Lambeg drum. Popular songs include \"The Sash\" and \"Derry's Walls\". Explicitly violent songs such as \"Billy Boys\" may also be played.\n\nThe vast majority of marchers are men, but there are some all-women bands and a few mixed bands. Some all-male bands have female flag or banner carriers. There are also some Women's Orange Lodges which take part in the parades. Orangewomen have paraded on the Twelfth in some rural areas since at least the mid-20th century, but were banned from the Belfast parades until the 1990s.\n\nOrangemen on parade typically wear a dark suit, an Orange sash, white gloves and a bowler hat. Certain Orangemen carry a ceremonial sword. In hot weather, many lodges will parade in short-sleeved shirts. Orangewomen have not developed a standard dress code, but usually dress formally. The supporting bands each have their own uniforms and colours. Both the Orangemen and bands carry elaborate banners depicting Orange heroes, historic or Biblical scenes, and/or political symbols and slogans. The most popular image is that of King William of Orange crossing the River Boyne during the famous battle there.\n\nAt the field, some lodges and bands don humorous outfits or accessories and make the return journey in them, and the mood is generally more mellow, although in times of tension it can also be more aggressive.\n\nThe Northern Irish and County Donegal parades are given extensive local TV and press coverage, while the BBC Northern Ireland programme \"The Twelfth\" is the longest running outside broadcast programme in Northern Ireland.\n\nOne of the largest Orange demonstrations held anywhere each year is the annual parade held at Rossnowlagh, a tiny village near Ballyshannon in the south of County Donegal in the west of Ulster. County Donegal being one of the Ulster counties in the Republic of Ireland, the Rossnowlagh demonstration is the only major Orange event in the Republic. A number of much smaller Orange events take place each year in East Donegal as well.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, where around half the population is from an Irish Catholic background, The Twelfth is a tense time. Orange marches through Irish Catholic and Irish nationalist neighbourhoods are usually met with opposition from residents, and this sometimes leads to violence. Many people see these marches as sectarian, triumphalist, supremacist, and an assertion of British and Ulster Protestant dominance. The political aspects have caused further tension. Marchers insist that they have the right to celebrate their culture and walk on public streets, particularly along their 'traditional routes'. In a 2011 survey of Orangemen throughout Northern Ireland, 58% of Orangemen said they should be allowed to march through Catholic or Irish nationalist areas with no restrictions; 20% said they should negotiate with residents first. Some have argued that members of both communities once participated in the event; although it has always been a Protestant affair and many Catholics opposed the marches.\nViolence has accompanied Twelfth marches since their beginning.\n\n\nDuring the Troubles (late 1960s to late 1990s), the Twelfth was often accompanied by riots and paramilitary violence. In 1972, three people were shot dead on the Twelfth in Portadown and two people were killed in Belfast. Of the five in total, two were killed by Republican groups and three were killed by Loyalist groups. On the Twelfth in 1998, during the Drumcree conflict, three young boys were killed when loyalists firebombed their house in Ballymoney. The boys' mother was a Catholic, and their home was in a mainly Protestant housing estate. The killings provoked widespread anger from both Catholics and Protestants.\n\nSince the Troubles began, some bands hired to appear at Twelfth marches have openly shown support for loyalist paramilitary groups, either by carrying paramilitary flags and banners or sporting paramilitary names and emblems. A number of prominent loyalist militants were Orangemen and took part in their marches. In February 1992, the loyalist Ulster Defence Association (UDA) shot dead five Catholic civilians in a betting shop in Belfast. When Orangemen marched past the shop that 12 July, some marchers held up five fingers in mockery of the five dead. The Secretary of State, Patrick Mayhew, said that they \"would have disgraced a tribe of cannibals\".\n\nEvery Twelfth between 1970 and 2005, British Army soldiers were deployed in Belfast to help police the parades. Due to improved policing, dialogue between marchers and residents, and the Northern Ireland peace process, parades have been generally more peaceful since the 2000s. The Parades Commission was set up in 1998 to deal with contentious parades.\n\nDuring the Troubles some Irish Catholic and nationalist areas organised festivals to keep their children away from the parades, where they might come into conflict with Protestant children, and to make the Twelfth more enjoyable for their communities.\n\nAlthough mostly an Ulster event, the Twelfth is also celebrated in other countries with strong links to Ulster or a history of settlement by Irish Protestants. Outside of Northern Ireland, there are commemorations of The Twelfth in Scotland – particularly in and around Glasgow, where most Irish immigrants settled. In England and Wales, Orange marches aren't common and Orange Order membership is found primarily in the Merseyside region, although numbers are still small. Marches here tend to be held a week or so before the Twelfth, due to the number of bands and lodges who travel to Northern Ireland to march there. The Liverpool lodges parade both in the city and in the seaside resort of Southport on 12 July.\n\nThere are also Twelfth marches in Canada and Australia. As the longest consecutively held parade in North America (first held in 1821), the Twelfth March was the largest parade in Toronto when thousands of Orangemen would march in front of tens of thousands of spectators, until the 1970s. At the time, the Orange Order held such sway that membership in the Order was an unspoken prerequisite for holding civic office. However, the march's popularity has drastically diminished in recent years, as only about 500 people participate in modern Orange parades. Orangemen's Day is still a significant holiday in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador, where it is an official provincial paid holiday. \n\nAn increase in membership in recent years has seen a revival of the Order in Australia and an annual Twelfth of July parade is currently held in Adelaide. Parades were also formerly held in New Zealand on the Twelfth.\n\nUntil the Partition of Ireland in the early 1920s, the Twelfth was celebrated by Protestants in many parts of Ireland. However, the reduction of Protestant political influence in what is now the Republic of Ireland has meant the only remaining major annual parade within the Republic is at Rossnowlagh, County Donegal, in the west of Ulster, which was held on the Twelfth until the 1970s, when it was moved to the weekend before. In the rest of Ireland, outside of the nine-county Province of Ulster, there are no major Orange events.\n\nIn July 2010, former Tánaiste Michael McDowell said that the Twelfth should be made a national holiday in the Republic of Ireland as well as in Northern Ireland..\n\n\n"}

But I've always wanted to be an actor. And part of what attracted me to the profession was the diversity of roles you can get.

Held on July 18, 1955, it was a meeting of \"The Big Four\": President Dwight D. Eisenhower of the United States, Prime Minister Anthony Eden of Britain, Premier Nikolai A. Bulganin of the Soviet Union, and Prime Minister Edgar Faure of France. They were accompanied by the foreign ministers of the four powers (who were also members of the Council of Foreign Ministers): John Foster Dulles, Harold Macmillan, Vyacheslav Molotov, and Antoine Pinay. Also in attendance was Nikita Khrushchev of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe purpose was to bring together world leaders to begin discussions on peace. Although those discussions led down many different roads (arms negotiations, trade barriers, diplomacy, nuclear warfare, etc.), the talks were influenced by the common goal for increased global security.\n\nThe stated mission of the 1955 summit was to reduce international tensions. The Geneva Summit was seen as an extremely important building block to better friendships and more open communication between the leaders of \"The Big Four\". The creation of an international community was introduced as a way to help relieve global tensions and mistrust. This community would form the critical foundation of a unified world in which minimal barriers to trade and common interests would serve to engender diplomacy. \nTopics such as East-West trade agreements, tariffs, the arms race, international security and disarmament policy were all addressed to some extent. The most significant proposal made by President Eisenhower was his \"Open Skies\" plan, which called for an international aerial monitoring system. The intent of this policy was to prevent nations from stockpiling dangerous weapons, and eventually lead to the disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction. Surprisingly, one goal that American political advisers had for the conference was to not make any specific promises or guarantees to the Soviets. In the past, Soviet leaders have misinterpreted American suggestions as whole-hearted promises later on, which could serve to bring more division instead of unity. Since this meeting was the first of its kind, the seeds of unification needed to be planted, nothing else.\n\nThe issue of East-West trade agreements was one that needed to be discussed very delicately. All previous East-West trade agreement talks had been anything but diplomatic. In the past, trade agreements had always been an occasion for discourse and heated arguments. Neither the UK nor the U.S. was willing to share control of their trading spheres unless there were obvious strategic advantages of doing so. Nations were at a standstill because no one was willing to compromise for the good of the worldwide community. The problem with peace talks is that although each nation knows the importance and benefits of peace, there is never enough mutual trust to ensure the success of such talks. The talks in Geneva helped break the ice and introduce nations to the benefits of global free trade. Also, simply by meeting and talking, the leaders were able to develop relationships and have an optimistic outlook on a peaceful and cooperative future.\n\nThe Cold War had a major impact on the topics debated during the Geneva Summit. International tensions were at its peak during the Cold War, as tensions were on the rise, the Cold War leaders thought it would be a good idea to unite under a common cause for peace in Geneva.\n\nThe world leaders discussed issues on security, armaments, German unification, and stronger East-West relationships. Khrushchev was willing to allow a united Germany providing it was neutral, but West German entrance into NATO in May made the situation increasingly complicated. Khrushchev wanted the removal of both NATO and the Warsaw Pact, to be replaced by a new system of collective security. According to the memoirs of Andrey Gromyko, a statement was made by the Soviet delegation that if peace was NATO's only objective, there could be no objection for the Soviet Union to join NATO. It was Allan Dulles who advised Dwight Eisenhower to refuse this proposal and the subject was neglected during the rest of the summit. This conference marked an era of renewed optimism in cold war relationships, however this was disrupted later by the Suez Crisis. \n\n\n"}

He lived for many years at the artists' colony at Cranbrook in Kent.\n\nWebster was born in Ranelagh Street, Pimlico, London. His father was a member of the household of George III, and the son, having shown an aptitude for music, became a \nchorister, first at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle, and then the Chapel Royal at St. James's Palace in London. He abandoned music for painting, however, \nand in 1821 was admitted as a student at the Royal Academy, exhibiting, in 1824, a portrait of \"Mr Robinson and Family\". In the following year he won first prize in the school of painting.\n\nIn 1825, also, Webster exhibited \"Rebels shooting a Prisoner\", at the Suffolk Street Gallery - the first of a series of pictures of schoolboy life for which he subsequently became known. In 1828 he exhibited \"The Gunpowder Plot\"' at the Royal Academy, and in 1829 \"The Prisoner\" and \"A Foraging Party Aroused\" at the British Institution. These were followed by numerous other pictures of school and village \nlife at both galleries. In 1840 Webster was elected an associate of the Royal Academy (ARA), and in 1846 a Royal Academician (RA). He continued to be a frequent exhibitor there until 1876, when he retired from \nthe academy. He exhibited a self-portrait in 1878, and \"Released from School\", his last picture, in 1879.\n\nIn 1856 Webster was photographed at the Photographic Institute in London by Robert Howlett, as part of a series of portraits of artists. The picture was among a group exhibited at the Art Treasures Exhibition in Manchester in 1857.\n\nFrom 1835 to 1856 Webster lived at The Mall, Kensington, but the last thirty years of his life were spent at the artists' colony in Cranbrook, Kent, where he died on 23 Sept. 1886.\n\nWebster became known for his genre paintings, often with children as subjects, depicting incidents from everyday life in a genial and humorous way. Many of these were exceedingly popular, particularly his \n\"Punch\" (1840) with which he procured associate membership of the Royal Academy.\n\nIn the limited range of subjects which he made his own, Webster was unrivalled. Some of his pictures - such as \"Please remember the Grotto\", \"Snowballing\" and maybe \"The Swing\" - were issued as prints by \nAbraham Le Blond. \"The Smile\" (1841), \"The Frown\" and \"The Boy with Many Friends\", are among the numerous pictures which became well known by engravings. He also contributed work to volumes issued by the London-based Etching Club: \"The Deserted Village\" (1841), \"Songs of Shakespeare\" (1843), and \"Etch'd Thoughts\" (1844).\n\nWebster was influential on the work of fellow Cranbrook artists George Bernard O'Neill and Frederick Daniel Hardy.\n\n\n"}

It is Lebanon's most important farming region. Industry also flourishes in Beqaa, especially that related to agriculture. \n\nThe Beqaa is located about east of Beirut. The valley is situated between Mount Lebanon to the west and the Anti-Lebanon mountains to the east. It forms the northeasternmost extension of the Great Rift Valley, which stretches from Syria to the Red Sea. Beqaa Valley is long and wide on average. It has a Mediterranean climate of wet, often snowy winters and dry, warm summers.\n\nThe region receives limited rainfall, particularly in the north, because Mount Lebanon creates a rain shadow that blocks precipitation coming from the sea. The northern section has an average annual rainfall of , compared to in the central valley. Two rivers originate in the valley: the Orontes (Asi), which flows north into Syria and Turkey, and the Litani, which flows south and then west to the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nFrom the 1st century BC, when the region was part of the Roman Empire, the Beqaa Valley served as a source of grain for the Roman provinces of the Levant. Today the valley makes up 40 percent of Lebanon's arable land. The northern end of the valley, with its scarce rainfall and less fertile soils, is used primarily as grazing land by pastoral nomads. Farther south, more fertile soils support crops of wheat, maize, cotton, and vegetables, with vineyards and orchards centered on Zahlé. The valley also produces hashish and cultivates opium poppies, which are exported as part of the illegal drug trade. Since 1957 the Litani hydroelectricity project, a series of canals and a dam located at Lake Qaraoun at the southern end of the valley, has improved irrigation to farms in Beqaa Valley.\n\nZahlé is the largest city and the administrative capital of the Beqaa Governorate. It lies just north of the main Beirut–Damascus highway, which bisects the valley. The majority of Zahlé's residents are Lebanese Christian, the majority being Melkite Greek Catholic, Maronite Catholic, and Greek Orthodox Christians. The town of Anjar, situated in the eastern part of the valley, has a predominantly Armenian Lebanese population and is also famous for its 8th-century Arab ruins.\n\nThe majority of the inhabitants of the northern districts of Beqaa, Baalbek and Hermel, are Lebanese Shia, with the exception of the town of Deir el Ahmar, whose inhabitants are Christians. The Baalbek and Hermel districts have a Christian and Sunni minority, mainly situated further north along the border with Syria.\n\nThe western and southern districts of the valley also have a mixed population of Muslims, Christians and also Druze. The town of Joub Janine with a population of about 12,000, is situated midway in the valley, and its population is Sunni. Joub Janine is the governmental center of the region known as Western Beqaa, with municipal services like the serail, which is the main government building in the area, emergency medical services (Red Cross), a fire department, and a courthouse. Other towns in the Western Beqaa district are Machghara, Sabghine, Kamed al Lawz, Qab Elias, Sohmor, Yohmor. The towns are all a mix of different Lebanese religious confessions. Rachaiya al Wadi, east of the Western Beqaa district, is home to Lebanon's share of Mount Hermon and borders Syria also. The district's capital, also Rachaiya al Wadi (as not to confuse with Rachaiya al Foukhar in South Lebanon), is famous for its old renovated souk and what is known as the castle of independence in which Lebanon's pre-independence leaders were held by French troops before being released in 1943. The southern section of the district is inhabited with Druze and Christian Lebanese, while the other northern section is mainly inhabited by Sunni Lebanese.\n\nDue to wars and the unstable economic and political conditions Lebanon faced in the past, with difficulties some farmers still face today, many previous inhabitants of the valley left for coastal cities in Lebanon or emigrated from the country altogether, with the majority residing in the Americas or Australia.\n\nThe ancient Roman ruins of Baalbek, an ancient city named for the Canaanite god Baal. The Romans renamed Baalbek \"Heliopolis\" and built an impressive temple complex, including temples to Bacchus, Jupiter, Venus, and the Sun. Today, the ruins are the site of the Baalbeck International Festival, which attracts artists and performance groups from around the world.\n\n\nThe Beqaa Valley is home to Lebanon's famous vineyards and wineries. Wine making is a tradition that goes back 6000 years in Lebanon. With an average altitude of 1000 m above sea level, the valley's climate is very suitable to vineyards. Abundant winter rain and much sunshine in the summer helps the grapes ripen easily. There are more than a dozen wineries in the Beqaa Valley, producing over six million bottles a year. Beqaa Valley wineries include: \n\n\nDrugs have a long tradition in the Beqaa Valley, from the days of the Roman Empire until today cultivators and tribal drug lords working with militias built up a thriving cannabis trade. During the Lebanese Civil War, cannabis cultivation was a major source of income in the Beqaa valley, where most of the country's hashish and opium was produced, a multibillion-dollar industry fueling the agricultural sector as well as political factions and organized crime.\nThe trade collapsed during the worldwide crackdown on narcotics led by the United States in the early 1990s. Under pressure from the U.S. State Department, the occupying Syrian Army plowed up the Beqaa's cannabis fields and sprayed them with poison. Since the mid-1990s, the culture and production of drugs in the Beqaa valley has been in steady decline, by 2002 an estimated 2,500 hectares of cannabis were limited to the extreme north of the valley, where government presence remains minimal. Every year since 2001 the Lebanese army plows cannabis fields in an effort to destroy the crops before harvest, it is estimated that that action eliminates no more than 30% of overall crops. Although important during the civil war, opium cultivation has become marginal, dropping from an estimated 30 metric tonnes per year in 1983 to negligible amounts in 2004.\n\nDue to increasing political unrest that weakened the central Lebanese government during 2006 Lebanon War and 2007 (Opposition boycott of the government) and due to the lack of viable alternatives (UN promises of irrigation projects and alternative crop subsidies that never materialised) drug cultivation and production have significantly increased, but remain a fraction of the civil war production and limited north of the town of Baalbek, where the rule of tribal law protecting armed families is still strong.\n\n\n"}

The game is ultimately of Frisian origin. To play, participants throw a ball (the kloot) as far as they can, using a relatively difficult throwing style that requires speed, power, and concentration. The sport has been occasionally banned due to negative associations, but achieved a measure of respectability as its first league was established by in 1902. The sport is divided into field, street, and standing play. Field and street play typically has two teams playing against each other, while standing play is individual. Stefan Albarus is the current record holder, throwing the ball 106.20 meters.\n\nThe term \"Kloot\" comes from Low German and derives from \"Kluten\", of similar etymology to English words such as \"clod\", \"clout\", \"clot\", \"cleat\", \"clay\" and \"cloth\" - all ultimately deriving from Proto-Germanic klautaz, meaning a ball or lump.\n\nKlootschieten likely arose from an ancient Frisian weapon, which the Frisians threw at ships and opponents. The Frisian fighters are said to have been feared for their missiles. In further development of this sport, heavy flint balls and two-pound iron balls were used. Later, the fist-sized balls were made of turned applewood, pierced crosswise with lead-filled holes.\n\nThe Dutch reformer Jacobus van Oudenhoven took in 1659 the \"Kloot werpen\" on a Sunday after the service in his \"sins register.\"\n\nIn the past, Kloot shooting had negative associations. Competitions often involved gambling for money or other valuables, heavy alcohol consumption, and disorderly conduct. It was even argued to get bloody at times. Since the sport was practiced in winter, the light sportswear was considered a risk factor for deaths from pneumonia. Accordingly, the sport was occasionally banned by the authorities, but ultimately klootschieten always prevailed.\n\nHinrich Dunkhase (1857-1905), in Burhave, Butjadingen, merged the Oldenburg and East Frisian klootschieten groups to form the \"Friesischer Klootschießer-Verband\" (\"Friesian klootschieten Association\", FKV) on May 25, 1902. This was the first competitive league developed for the sport. Dunkhase was its chairman until his death.\n\nIn the National Socialist period, the FKV resisted integration into the \"(NS) Reichsbund for physical exercises\" by not reporting to the sports organizations, instead wanting klootschieten to be known as a traditional German and Friesan game. The FKV joined the \"Nazi cultural community\" and was able to retain a certain degree of independence. In particular, Low German or Frisian could be spoken at the competition, which was prohibited in a \"sport\".\n\nAfter the Second World War, the FKV oriented again and became a member of the National \"Sports Association\" Lower Saxony a \"sport.\"\n\nToday, NKB (Nederlandse Klottschietbond) is today the umbrella organization of more than 40,000 players of Klootschieter and the related game of \"Boßeln\" (Bosseln). The sport is also represented by sports confederations of the regions North Rhine-Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein. In the Netherlands there is the \"Dutch Klootschieters Bond\" (NKB, founded in 1967) and in Ireland the \"Irish Road Bowling Association\" (Irish: \"Ból Chumann na hÉireann\", founded in 1954). International umbrella organization is the \"International Bowlplaying Association\" (IBA, founded in 1969). Competitions also take place among Irish immigrants in the US and Canada as it is part of traditional Irish folk culture.\n\nEuropean championships (as \"road bowling\") have been held since 1969 (every four years since 1980) between the Netherlands, Ireland and Germany in the three disciplines of field, street and standing competition.\n\nThere are three styles: field, street, and standing (\"veld\", \"straat\", and \"zetten\").\n\nIn the field (\"veld\") version of klootschieten, it is the intention, alone or in a team, to reach a particular patch of grass and/or sand in as few throws as possible (similar in this respect to golf). The course contains curves and variations of height (small hills and valleys and such), so that skill as well as strength is an important factor.\n\nThe field kloot is a round ball of wood or synthetic material, made heavier with lead. The diameter of the kloot is mostly between 7 and 8 centimetres, but these can deviate according to the preference of the participants. There is a minimum diameter of 5 centimetres.\n\nIn the street (\"straat\") version of klootschieten, the rules are approximately the same as in the field version, except that the course (being a street, country lane or similar) and the ball (being heavier) are different. An important consideration in the street version is to keep the ball away from obstacles such as ditches, gutters, streams, long grass etc., which would reduce the distance of ones \"shoot\". The experienced player will sometimes deliberately aim for such places on uphill stretches, to avoid the possibility of the ball rolling back downhill.\n\nThe goal in the standing or setting (\"zetten\") style is to see how far the ball can travel in the air (similar in this respect to the hammer throw and shotput). Thus the measure of the throw ends at the point where the ball hits the ground (in contrast to the field and street variants).\n\nIn Germany a sport similar to field style klootschieten is played, named \"Boßeln\" (Bosseln), while Klootschießen is the German name for the standing style. It is primarily played along the coast and borders of North Germany, such as in Ostfriesland, Oldenburg, Butjadingen, Dithmarschen, Nordfriesland, Emsland, and Grafschaft Bentheim. It is also played in some parts of the United States by German and Dutch immigrants.\n\nIn Ireland, a similar game is played under the name road bowling.\nIn May 2004, the European Championship was held in Westerstede, Germany.\n\nAt the adult level, the German FKB (Friesischer Klootschießer Connection) won all competitions. The individual winners:\n\nIn May 2008, the European Championships was held near Cork, Ireland.\n\nFor the first time in 1935, the kloot was thrown over the 100-meter mark by Ostfriesen Gerd Gerdes. This record lasted until 1985, when Auricher Harm Henkel threw 102.00 meters. This new record was beaten the same day by the \"Bear of Ellens\" Hans-Georg Bohlken with 105.20 meters. The current (as of January 2006) record is 106.20 meters, held by Stefan Albarus from the north in East Frisia.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2162432", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2162432", "title": "Crumbsuckers", "text": "Crumbsuckers\n\nCrumbsuckers was an American crossover thrash band originally formed by bass player Gary Meskil in 1982, in his home town of Baldwin, Nassau County, New York, United States.\n\nCrumbsuckers amalgamated thrash and hardcore punk sounds and themes, making an immediate impact on the wider scene with their 1986 debut album, \"Life of Dreams\".\n\nThough the band was supported by its fanbase and fellow artists, Crumbsuckers second album, \"Beast on My Back\", failed to deliver on expectations, despite the musicianship displayed on the recording. The departure of lead vocalist Chris Notaro in 1988 started the band's gradual decline, despite the Crumbsuckers attempts to create a new identity. Even so, the band had already firmly cemented themselves as pioneers of the crossover thrash movement.\n\nCrumbsuckers played its latest reunion show (with Chris Notaro on vocals) at the 2015 Black N' Blue Bowl Festival at Webster Hall (formerly the Ritz) in New York City on May 17, 2015.\n\nIn June 1983, the band recorded a five-song demo unofficially called \"The Crumbsucker Cave\" (the name given to the place where Crumbsuckers used to rehearse) at Nino Studio in Baldwin, which included a cover of Chubby Checker's \"The Twist\". It was with this demo that the band landed their first CBGBs showcase, and subsequent 'Hardcore' matinees.\n\nAt that time, the line up consisted of Dave Brady - vocals, Dave Wynn - guitar, Gary Meskil - bass and Kevin 'Toast' Carroll - drums. From the time of their first matinee performance, they prided themselves on playing all original music, with the occasional homage to such tracks as Black Sabbath's \"Sweet Leaf\" and the theme from \"Inspector Gadget\".\n\nEarly in 1985, looking for a sharper edge, they added a second guitarist; fellow Baldwin resident Chuck Lenihan, and replaced Carroll with a local 16-year-old drummer, Dan Richardson. Lenihan's metal-influenced guitar solos contrasted beautifully with Wynn's blues-based offerings. Both Crumbsuckers' lyrics and musical direction naturally took a notable turn towards a more metal edge, with songs such as \"Life of Dreams\" and \"Return to the Womb\" written around this time.\n\nFollowing Brady's departure, they needed to recruit a new singer and soon found one from another local hardcore band, Krakdown; Chris Notaro. Whilst opinions may vary, the \"classic\" line-up was now complete, and so they set about recording and releasing their first album. \n\nThe band recorded their debut album \"Life of Dreams\" at Systems Two Studios in Brooklyn, New York, in 1985, which was released through Combat Records the following year. Produced by Norman Dunn, the album contained 16 tracks clocking in at less than 33 minutes. \"Life of Dreams\" delivered a collection of 158 punk/metal-style riffs, with metal-style and blues-style guitar solos, laced with frequent time changes and all topped off with Chris Notaro's gravel-style vocals. The closing track, \"Moment Of Silence/Mr Hyde\" demonstrated their ability to tone down the intensity of the previous tracks during a passage of clean and melodic acoustic guitars, before launching back into a frenzy of fuzz and aural aggression to round off the album. \"Life of Dreams\" was greeted with very mixed reviews in the music press.\n\nThe album's cover artwork was designed and painted by Sean Taggart, a local New York artist who had provided gig flyers for NYHC bands, as well as providing album covers such as Agnostic Front's \"Cause for Alarm\", Carnivore's \"Carnivore\" and \"Retaliation\", Prong's \"Primitive Origins\" and Whiplash's \"Power and Pain\". He later went on to provide album covers (and eventually, defining cartoon characters) for the Jerky Boys.\n\nCrumbsuckers recorded videos for three tracks from \"Life of Dreams\" 'live' at CBGBs in 1986, with only one track, \"Trapped\", being commercially released. (The other two tracks, \"Bullshit Society\" and \"Return to the Womb\", disappeared for many years but have since surfaced on YouTube.) \"Trapped\" originally featured as the opening song on an underground video compilation of English and North American punk bands called \"Hardcore\", released by Jettisoundz in 1986. The track is now widely available to view on YouTube.\n\nIn the spring of 1987, guitarist Dave Wynn left the band and, after a few guitarists came and went, Robbie Koebler stepped in to help record their sophomore album \"Beast On My Back\" (the acronym \"B.O.M.B.\" being assigned to this release).\n\nThe album opens with a passage of slightly dark, melancholic piano, played by Lenihan's cousin, Mike Francis. The piece had originally been written on guitar (and performed later as such in the live arena), but offered an immediate surprise to those listeners who had become familiar with \"Life of Dreams\", and certainly differed from other metal/crossover albums of the era. The guitar-driven instrumental tracks \"Rejuvenate\" and \"Initial Shock\" were penned by Matt Cardin, a fellow Baldwin native and guitarist, although no credit was actually given on the record sleeve. (Cardin had also contributed ideas to a few tracks that found their way on \"Life of Dreams\".)\n\nThe band was nominated as the \"Best Hardcore Rock Band\" in the 1988 New York Music Awards.\n\nBy now, Crumbsuckers were rubbing shoulders with some of their musical peers, including high-profile bands such as Anthrax, Megadeth and Metallica. The shoulder-rubbing also extended to lesser commercially-successful artists, such as Agnostic Front, Bad Brains, Cro-Mags and Carnivore. It was during this period that Marc Piovanetti (from Carnivore) joined Crumbsuckers as a full-time guitarist, following the long-standing vacancy left open since the departure of Dave Wynn (and the subsequent entourage of stand-ins).\n\nFollowing a successful US tour to promote \"Beast On My Back\" in 1988, playing with such bands as Sacred Reich and Pantera, Notaro decided this was not for him, citing 'musical differences'. At that point, the band were already contracted to fulfill a winter tour in Europe (with Onslaught as headliners) in late 1988, but Notaro's replacement for those shows, Joe Haggerty, failed to deliver the vocal performances which had become a trademark of their overall sound.\n\nWithin a few weeks of returning home from their European Tour, Haggerty was fired and replaced with a local singer, Craig Allen. New material was written and tightly rehearsed, with a new sound emerging, leading to the band dropping the name Crumbsuckers in favor of a new identity as Heavy Rain.\nHeavy Rain offered a more radio-friendly rock sound, with vocals more akin to Queensrÿche's Geoff Tate. Whilst they retained small doses of Crumbsuckers' audacious/ridiculous guitar solos, most songs were recorded and presented in a much more straight, hard rock feel. Despite the quality of their new material or their formidable heritage, these new songs failed to attract any interest or support from record companies who had been approached. Much time and effort was spent recording a considerable number of professional studio demos between 1989 and 1990, although nothing was ever officially released. Heavy Rain kept on writing and rehearsing, playing the odd showcase from time to time but, even though they eventually replaced Allen with a new, much stronger singer, things just simply failed to come together them.\n\nHeavy Rain disbanded in late 1990. A combination of contractual arguments and disagreements as to which direction the band should take, coupled with the poor response from potential record company interest led to the project's collapse.\n\nFrom the ashes of Heavy Rain (and Crumbsuckers), Lenihan began jamming with former (Stormtroopers of Death and M.O.D.) vocalist Billy Milano, under a new project called Rawhead. Meskil and Richardson came on board but, over a period of months, a revolving door of guitarists ensued. Lenihan was dismissed and replaced by another Baldwin guitarist, Al Zaleski. He was later replaced by a third Baldwin fret-wizard, Tom Klimchuck, who would eventually take a sabbatical from the band.\n\nIn the late summer of 1991, Meskil came up with a new name for the band, Pro-Pain and the band gathered at Pyramid Sound Studios, Ithaca, New York to record their debut album, \"Foul Taste of Freedom\". However, further line-up changes took place here, with Milano being sent home (as Meskil decided to take over the vocal duties himself), whilst Lenihan was briefly drafted back in to play lead guitar, only to be ejected for a second time shortly afterwards. A new guitarist, Mike Mays, eventually ended up playing lead guitar on the album tracks. With Klimchuck all the while considered the official Pro-Pain guitarist, but still unfortunately unavailable to tour at that time, the baton was then passed to another new guitarist, Nick St Denis, who finally helped bring a measure of stability to the line up, certainly for the next few years.\n\nPro-Pain released three albums between 1992 and 1996, touring extensively in Europe and the US, but the departure of founding drummer Dan Richardson in 1996 left Meskil as the only original 'Crumbsucker' in the band. From there, Pro-Pain added a second guitarist. Meskil's remarkable and commendable commitment to keeping Pro-Pain alive and kicking for over 20 plus years, mostly self-financed, (thus avoiding record company interference), has been in keeping with the original Crumbsuckers ethos and vibe.\n\nPro-Pain never lost sight of their roots, something they favorably demonstrated when they recorded a cover version of \"Just Sit There\" on their 2003 covers album, \"Run For Cover\".\n\nIn 2006, long-time Pro-Pain guitarist, Tom Klimchuck, had the honor of playing on stage with Crumbsuckers at their Reunion Show at BB Kings, playing in tandem with original lead guitarist, Chuck Lenihan. In 2015, current Pro-Pain guitarist, Adam Philips, joined Crumbsuckers on stage in the same capacity as Klimchuck did in 2006.\n\nIn the summer of 1990, Meskil (inspired by a visit from a devoted English fan, Alex Meissner), put together a Crumbsuckers reunion show with Chris Notaro, being that Meissner had felt somewhat 'cheated' seeing Crumbsuckers in the UK in 1988 without Notaro.\n\nCrumbsuckers' first reunion show was held at the Sundance Club in Bayshore, Long Island, on 24 August 1990, with Chris Notaro returning to vocal duties for the first time since his departure in 1988 and featured the same line-up from the tour of that year; Lenihan, Meskil, Notaro, Piovanetti and Richardson. The venue was sold out.\nSixteen years passed until Crumbsuckers reunited once again on 3 August 2006 at B.B.Kings in New York City, to commemorate 20 years since the release of their debut album \"Life of Dreams\".\n\nOnce again, it was Alex Meissner who helped initiate the reunion, having rebuilt broken bridges between some of the original band members. The packed out venue witnessed an appearance by original members Dave Wynn and Dave Brady on the classic track \"Hub Run\". Around 2000 fans gathered that evening to celebrate the anniversary, including a significant number of old friends of Crumbsuckers from the early days (many of whom had driven or flown considerable distances to attend the show). Everyone considered the evening to be the equivalent to a 'big old class reunion', with Dream Theater's (then) drummer Mike Portnoy making particular reference to the evening on his personal website.\n\nOn December 24, 2014, it was announced that the band would reunite one more time, to play the Black N' Blue Bowl (in New York) in May 2015. The line up of: Chris Notaro - vocals, Gary Meskil - bass, Chuck Lenihan - guitar, Adam Phillips - guitar and Dan Richardson - drums successfully took to the stage on May 17, 2015.\n\nTheir combined styles, with\nearned them respect among the CBGBs matinee crowd. In 1985, they recorded a second demo at CBGBs, with a new five-piece line up, featuring a very young but talented drummer (Dan Richardson) and began searching for a record deal. It was during this time that long-time vocalist Dave Brady left the band.\n\nNotaro, known for his gruff vocals and high-energy stage antics, was a founding member of the Long Island band \"Krakdown\", contemporaries of the already well-established Crumbsuckers. Getting Notaro on board was a natural fit and very much in keeping with the Long Island vibe.\n\nCrumbsuckers' musical style has been afforded many titles, including \"Hardcore\", \"Speedcore\", \"Thrash\" (which extends to \"Thrash/Punk\" and \"Thrash/Metal\"), \"Crossover\" and \"Speed Metal\". Along with local comrades such as Agnostic Front, Bad Brains and Cro-Mags offering similar contributions on the East Coast, and bands such as DRI, Excel (band) and Suicidal Tendencies reflecting a similar movement over on the West Coast, Crumbsuckers were certainly at the forefront of this new hardcore punk/thrash/metal crossover movement.\n\nThe band's name was allegedly conceived following an incident in the canteen at Baldwin High School, where Gary Meskil observed a fellow student sucking the crumbs off his plate; \"'Hey! Look at that crumbsucker!'\" Meskil supposedly exclaimed and, from there, the name Crumbsuckers was born.\n\nCrumbsuckers were one of the first bands to mix the two genres of hardcore punk ethos and heavy metal pathos, as evidenced on their debut album \"Life Of Dreams\". The songs were written by Gary Meskil, Dave Wynn, Chuck Lenihan and Dave Brady over the course of their formative years, 1983-1985.\n\nCrumbsuckers' shortest ever officially recorded song was \"Shot Down\", clocking in at 55 seconds, but they had an even shorter song called \"Kids At My School\" which lasted only 47 seconds. This latter track finally made it to vinyl some 30 years later, on \"Turn Back Time: The Early Years 1983-1985\".\n\nOnly two songs on \"Life of Dreams\" featured lyrics written by new vocalist Chris Notaro (\"The Longest War\" and \"Mr Hyde\").\n\nThe song \"Charge\" was originally composed as an instrumental song \"Charge of the Light Brigade\" and was erstwhile earmarked for inclusion on \"Life of Dreams\". However, it was later extended, with lyrics added, and eventually found its home on \"Beast On My Back\".\n\nAlthough an all-American band, Crumbsuckers' heritage is mostly derived from European lineages: Germany (Meskil), Great Britain (Richardson), Ireland (Brady & Lenihan) and Italy (Notaro & Piovanetti).\n\nWhile Crumbsuckers were riding high in 1988, they remained great friends with another Long Island band who had yet to fully blossom. That band was called Majesty. Waving a strong demo tape before the bosses at Mechanic Records, Chuck Lenihan campaigned hard to get them to offer Majesty a record deal, which they eventually agreed to in 1988, giving Majesty their first big break. Shortly afterwards, having recorded and released their debut album, Majesty changed their name to Dream Theater.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Lenihan spent many of his Saturday mornings teaching guitar to young, local aspiring guitarists. With the money he made, he then took guitar lessons himself from Al Pitrelli.\n\nBetween band rehearsals, drummer Dan Richardson pushed himself by donning a set of headphones and jamming along to albums such as Rush's \"Power Windows\" to hone his drumming skills. Furthermore, he often utilized an electronic metronome during band rehearsals to get the band to play with pin-point accuracy.\n\nAfter leaving Pro-Pain, then joining Life of Agony at the height of their success, Dan Richardson later turned down an opportunity to join Nine Inch Nails. He later played drums with Stereomud on their first two albums.\n\nGary Meskil paid a fitting tribute (and respectful nod) to his former band by recording a new version of \"Just Sit There\" on the 2003 Pro-Pain album, \"Run For Cover\".\n\nLenihan's trademark white Aria Pro II Flying-V guitar, featured in countless photographs from their live shows during the 1980s, was accidentally left behind at a venue in Paris, France, while Chuck was touring with Genitorturers in 2002. Since that loss, he has adopted a Gibson SG for his live shows.\n\nCrumbsuckers' musical family tree has extended in many different directions, including: Darkhaus, Pro-Pain - (Meskil), Life of Agony, Pro-Pain, Stereomud, Medication - (Richardson), Christian Death, Electric Hellfire Club, Genitorturers, Glitter Guns, Vasaria - (Lenihan) and Carnivore [reunion shows], Lava Baby - (Piovanetti).\n\n\n"}

He is best known for being the first presenter of the BBC Television science programme \"Tomorrow's World\", continuing for 12 years, from 1965 to 1977. He also provided radio commentary at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, the funerals of King George VI, Winston Churchill and Lord Mountbatten of Burma, and the first flight of Concorde.\n\nBaxter was born in Ilford in Essex. His father was a science teacher. He was educated at Ilford County High School, a grammar school for boys, from which he was expelled after being caught smoking. He did not go on to a college or university. Baxter worked for a brief period at the Metropolitan Water Board.\n\nIn August 1940, during World War II, he joined the Royal Air Force and trained as a fighter pilot in Canada. He first flew Supermarine Spitfires with No. 65 Squadron RAF in Britain, based in Scotland. He joined No. 93 Squadron RAF, flying over Sicily in 1943, where he was mentioned in dispatches. He returned to England in 1944 as an instructor and was later a flight commander, returning to active service with No. 602 Squadron RAF in September 1944.\n\nOn 18 March 1945, Baxter took part in a daylight raid on the Shell-Mex building in The Hague, which was then the German headquarters for V-1 and V-2 rocket attacks on southern England. The commander of the raid, Max Sutherland, received a bar to his DFC and Baxter, along with the three other pilots, was again mentioned in dispatches.\n\nIn an interview about his wartime career, Baxter described flying over a V-2 site during a launch on 14 February 1945, and his wingman firing on the missile: \"I dread to think what would have happened if he'd hit the thing!\"\n\nHe later flew North American Mustang and Douglas Dakota aircraft for a year, then worked in Forces Broadcasting Service (FBS) from 1945 to 1949, based in Cairo and then Hamburg, becoming its deputy director. He was demobbed in 1946 as a flight lieutenant.\n\nBaxter joined the BBC in 1950. He provided radio commentary on the funerals of King George VI in 1952 and Winston Churchill in 1965, the former commentary given while suspended from the ceiling of Westminster Abbey. He also reported at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, reporting from Trafalgar Square.\n\nBaxter was an accomplished rally driver and competed in the Monte Carlo Rally twelve times, six of them as a member of the BMC Works Team. He also competed in numerous Alpine, Tulip and RAC Rallies, which was satirised in the character \"Roland Thraxter\" in Peter Ustinov's \"Grand Prix du Rock\". He was a crew member in the New Zealand Air Race in 1953, in a British European Airways Vickers Viscount.\n\nHaving an authoritative voice, he frequently commentated on motoring and aviation events. He was the BBC's motoring correspondent from 1950 to 1966, including at least twenty Formula One races, the Le Mans 24-hour race, and the Monte Carlo Rally. To parody this, he was invited to appear in an episode of \"Hancock's Half Hour\" when Hancock entered the rally, and onto \"I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue\" to commentate on sessions of Mornington Crescent. From 1967 to 1968, he was briefly Director of Motoring Publicity for the British Motor Corporation, while still presenting for the BBC. Following BMC's takeover by Leyland Motors, it was decided to dispense with Baxter's services in this post, and he returned to work full-time for the BBC. He presented the BBC's coverage of Farnborough Airshows from 1950 to 1986. He reported on the first flight of Concorde and was the first reporter to broadcast from an aeroplane, ocean liner and underwater. For thirty years, he was the regular commentator at the Royal British Legion's annual Festival of Remembrance at the Albert Hall and at the Royal Tournament. He presented the opening ceremony of the 1960 Summer Olympics, deputising for an indisposed Richard Dimbleby.\n\nHe presented the science series \"Eye on Research\" from 1959 to 1963, and was the first (and initially sole) host of the long-running popular science show \"Tomorrow's World\" for 12 years from July 1965, reaching an audience of up to 10 million viewers. He was the presenter of the first live transatlantic broadcast from the US via Telstar in 1962, the first live telecast from Australia in November 1966, and interviewed South African surgeon Christiaan Barnard by telephone in 1967, within hours of the completion of the world's first heart transplant operation. Baxter also undertook commercial commissions. He was the presenter for the launch of Gillette's G2 Razors held at the Heathrow Hotel, London, in 1973. He left the \"Tomorrow's World\" programme in 1977, after disagreements with its new editor, Michael Blakstad, who described Baxter as \"the last of the dinosaurs\", while Baxter reputedly said he could not work with someone who arrived at the BBC each day on a bicycle.\n\nBaxter was invited to present the first Raymond Baxter Award for Science Communication in July 2000. He was surprised to find that he was the first recipient.\n\nIn 1975 Baxter narrated \"The Hammond Organ 40th Anniversary Album\", issued by Ad-Rhythm Records. Baxter also narrated \"The Story of Rolls-Royce\", a 1988 film about the history of the world's most prestigious motor car, made by the Rolls-Royce Enthusiasts' Club. He also presented and narrated two fire safety training films in the 1970s; the first for Consort Films, entitled \"Fire Danger in Hospitals\" in 1972, about what fires can break out due to carelessness and another, undated, entitled \"Hospital Evacuation and You\".\n\nBaxter was made an Honorary Freeman of the City of London in 1978 and awarded the OBE in 2003. He was a member of the Committee of Management of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution from 1979 to 1997, and Vice-President from 1987 to 1997. He became a Life Vice-President in 1997.\n\nIn 1998 he was the subject of \"This Is Your Life\" when he was surprised by Michael Aspel with the help of Stirling Moss, at a Soho recording studio.\n\nBaxter was a founder member of the Association of Dunkirk Little Ships – he owned one of the small vessels that evacuated British troops from the beaches – and its Honorary Admiral from 1982, and Honorary Chairman of the Royal Aeronautical Society from 1991. He was on the Council of the Air League from 1980 to 1985.\n\nHe married his American wife, Sylvia Kathryn Johnson, in 1945. They had a son, Graham, and a daughter, Jenny who is a fencing coach. Sylvia died in 1996. Baxter died 15 September 2006 at the age of 84 at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, close to his home in Henley-on-Thames. In a statement his family said: \"He had a love of innovation and challenge both professionally and personally.\" Baxter was the uncle of the American minimalist artist, Carl Andre. \n\n\n\n\n"}

It is located in East Downtown Albuquerque, New Mexico and is protected by the city as a historic landmark. It is located on the northeast corner of Central and Broadway NE, at the center of an area that has become known as East Downtown or EDo. The campus comprises five buildings, the oldest of which was built in 1914. After the school moved to a new location in 1974, the old buildings were left abandoned for decades before being renovated as loft apartments in the early 21st century. Old Albuquerque High was added to the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties in 1977.\n\nThe Old Albuquerque High campus comprises five buildings grouped around a central courtyard. All of the buildings were designed in the Gothic Revival style typical of early 20th-century school architecture.\n\nOld Main is the original building, constructed in 1914. It is located on the southeast corner of the campus, facing Central Avenue. The three-story building was designed by Henry C. Trost and originally housed classrooms, a gymnasium, a library, an auditorium, and a science laboratory.\n\nThe Manual Arts Building was built in 1927 on the east side of campus, facing Arno Street. It has three stories and of floor area, and originally housed a woodshop and machine shop in addition to classrooms. It was designed by local architect George Williamson.\n\nThe Classroom Building (1937), Gymnasium (1938), and Library (1940) were all designed by Louis Hesselden and built with New Deal funding and Works Progress Administration labor. The Gymnasium, which sits at the north end of the campus, is the largest building with of floor area. The Classroom Building and the Library face Broadway on the west side of campus.\n\nOld Main was built in 1914, replacing Albuquerque High's previous location in the Central School building downtown. At the time Albuquerque had only 12,000 residents, and critics complained that the new building was too large and would never reach its capacity of 500 students. This proved not to be the case as a second building was required just 13 years later, and the campus had grown to five buildings by 1940. Albuquerque High remained the only high school in the city until Highland High School opened in 1949.\n\nIn 1974, Albuquerque High School moved to a new location about one mile (1.6 km) to the north, leaving the old campus vacant. Albuquerque Public Schools eventually sold the buildings, and they were left to deteriorate over the next 25 years as various plans to reuse them fell through and the surrounding neighborhood became increasingly blighted.\n\nEfforts to renovate the former high school intensified in 1989 when the Albuquerque City Council authorized funds to purchase the property. In 1996, after years of legal wrangling, the city succeeded in acquiring four of the five campus buildings for $1.5 million. The city eventually settled on a plan to convert the buildings into loft apartments in a joint venture with a private developer, and work began in 2001. The Classroom Building and Old Main were the first to be renovated, followed by the Gymnasium, Library, and finally the separately-owned Manual Arts Building. The renovation preserved many interior details such as doors, handrails, and even blackboards. The gymnasium and library reading room are protected spaces and have also been preserved.\n\nThe success of the project spurred further revitalization efforts in the surrounding area, leading the city to draft an East Downtown master plan in 2005 to guide future development.\n\n"}

The entire range was mapped in detail, by the United States Geological Survey, using various surveys and U.S. Navy trimetrogon photography performed from 1958 to 1960.\n\nThe following are the five mountains, all volcanic in origin, of the Executive Committee Range, in order from south to north.\n\nMount Waesche, the southernmost mountain in the range, rises to .\nMount Sidley, northeast of Mount Waesche, is the highest in the range and the highest volcano in Antarctica, with a summit of .\n\nMount Hartigan () is a broad mountain immediately north of Mount Sidley. Mount Hartigan rises to , at the higher of its twin Boudette Peaks, located in its northern portion.\n\nThe mountain was discovered by the United States Antarctic Service expedition on a flight, Dec. 15, 1940, and named for Rear Admiral Charles C. Hartigan, U.S. Navy (USN), Navy Department member of the Antarctic Service Executive Committee.\nMount Cumming () is a low, mostly snow-covered mountain, volcanic in origin, located midway between Mount Hampton and Mount Hartigan. A circular snow-covered crater occupies the summit area, rising to at Annexstad Peak, on the southwest side of the crater rim.\n\nDiscovered by the U.S. Antarctic Service (USAS) (1939–41) on a flight, Dec. 15, 1940, and named for Hugh S. Cumming, Jr., State Department member of the U.S. Antarctic Service (USAS) Executive Committee. Mapped by U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) from surveys and U.S. Navy trimetrogon photography, 1958-60.\n\nMount Hampton, the northernmost mountain in the range, rises to at Marks Peak, on the south side of its crater rim.\n\nThe five mountains have a number of associated subsidiary peaks that have been identified and named.\n\nChang Peak rises to on the northeastern slope of Mount Waesche.\n\nDoumani Peak rises to on the southern slopes of Mount Sidley.\n\nLavris Peak rises to in the northeastern portion of Mount Hartigan.\n\nLe Vaux Peak () is a small peak on the east side of the crater rim of Mount Cumming.

Ice penetrating radar results reported in this study indicated a sub-ice topographic feature, interpreted as a volcano, above the seismic swarms. The study also reported a mid-icecap (1400 m depth) ash layer about 8,000 years old that was interpreted as probably originating at nearby Mount Waesche.\n"}

His maternal grandparents were Pauline (Ives) and author, educator, and former Columbia professor John Erskine. Timothy Crouse's affinity for campaign reporters and the theater took root from his father, Russel Crouse, who was a career newspaperman and playwright. \"The stories he told me of his newspaper days—especially traveling around the country with prankish sports teams—had a fatal tinge of romance about them,\" said Crouse. His father's career in theatre began in 1928 when he played Bellflower in the play \"Gentlemen of the Press\". Later, his father turned his attention to writing. In 1934, he and his long-time partner Howard Lindsay together revised P. G. Wodehouse and Guy Bolton's book for the Cole Porter musical \"Anything Goes.\" \"My father and Howard's trademark was a painstaking craftsmanship,\" says Crouse. \"They spent months on an outline for a play, then worked on the dialogue, then rewrote and rewrote until everything was just right.\" And more than fifty years after his father collaborated on the original score, Timothy Crouse's revised libretto of \"Anything Goes\" opened on Broadway.\n\nCrouse is the brother of actress Lindsay Crouse. He attended Harvard University.\n\nCrouse served as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Morocco from 1968 to 1969. Returning to the United States he wrote for the \"Boston Herald\" before joining the staff of \"Rolling Stone\" where he worked as a contributing editor from 1971 to 1972.\n\nCrouse is the author of \"The Boys on the Bus\", a largely critical look at the journalists who covered the 1972 US presidential campaign. As a young \"Rolling Stone\" reporter he wrote music stories, but he wanted to try his hand at political reporting. At a 1972 \"Rolling Stone\" staff meeting the only other writer interested in covering the election was his colleague, the legendary writer Hunter S. Thompson, so Crouse latched onto him. \"It only took a few days of riding the bus for me to see that the reporters themselves would make a great story,\" Crouse said. Crouse also profiled Hunter S. Thompson in the book. [Thompson] \"wrote to provoke, shock, protest and annoy,\" wrote Crouse. Crouse also profiled R.W. Apple, the legendary reporter and editor at the \"New York Times\". Reporters \"recognized many of their own traits in him, grotesquely magnified. The shock of recognition frightened them. Apple was like them, only more blatant. He openly displayed the faults they tried to hide: the insecurity, the ambitiousness, the name-dropping\" and \"the weakness for powerful men.\" David Broder and Robert Novak are also profiled in the book. In the book, Crouse coins the term pack journalism. \"The press likes to demonstrate its power by destroying lightweights, and pack journalism is never more doughty and complacent than when the pack has tacitly agreed that a candidate is a joke.\"\n\nAfter \"The Boys on the Bus\", Crouse became the Washington columnist for \"Esquire\" and also wrote articles for \"The New Yorker\" and \"The Village Voice\". In 1982 Crouse conceived the idea of reviving \"Anything Goes\". He co-authored a new libretto for the musical with John Weidman that opened at the Vivian Beaumont Theater on October 19, 1987, and ran for 784 performances. They re-ordered the musical numbers, borrowing Cole Porter pieces from other Porter shows, a practice which the composer often engaged in. (\"Easy To Love\" was from the 1936 movie \"Born to Dance\".) In 2002 the musical was produced at the Royal National Theatre in London. In 2000 Alfred A. Knopf published Crouse and Luc Brébion's translation of Nobel-prize winner Roger Martin du Gard's nearly 800-page memoir \"Lieutenant-Colonel de Maumort\". Crouse has been working on fiction for the past several years and his story \"Sphinxes\" appeared in the Spring 2003 issue of \"\".\n\n"}

On September 28, 1850, the United States Congress appropriated $6,500 to construct a light at Eagle River. A site was selected that year, but it took until 1853 for the Michigan Legislature to obtain title to the site. Construction was not completed until 1857.\n\nThe light was situated on a sand bluff overlooking Lake Superior on the west bank of the river. The tower was only high, but because of its location on a bluff, the sixth order Fresnel lens could be seen for a distance of ten nautical miles.\n\nCracks at the base of the station were documented in 1867, and the entire structure was said to be in danger of collapsing. Congress appropriated $14,000 in 1869 to build a replacement, but recalled the funds in 1870 due to a shortfall in the federal budget.\n\nAfter copper in the Keweenaw area was commercially exhausted, the copper mining boom collapsed. The principal mine, the Cliff Mine, closed in 1873 and the Eagle River port became idle. Although the harbor quickly fell into disrepair, the light station continued to serve as the only marker of the shore between the Keweenaw Waterway and Eagle Harbor.\n\nThe station was renovated and partially rebuilt in 1884. By 1892, it was recommended that the light station be decommissioned and a new light be built a few miles to the east at Five Mile Point. In 1893, Congress authorized construction of the Sand Hills Lighthouse, but failed to appropriate any funds to carry out the construction. This situation continued for many years. The Eagle River Light Station was decommissioned in 1908 and its buildings were sold at auction in that year. The replacement light would not be built until 1917 and after at least ten vessels had been lost on the nearby Sawtooth Reef.\n\nThe Eagle River Lighthouse is in private ownership owned by Edward “Bud” Cole, a historic preservationist with a family lineage in the Keweenaw dating back to the 1850s. Along with the Eagle River Lighthouse, he also owns several other historically significant buildings in Eagle River and over 800 acres of the Eagle River corridor with 2 miles of Eagle River running through the property. Cole is also the owner of the Sandhills Lighthouse purchased in March 2019.\n\nThe Eagle River Lighthouse is available for rent on Homeaway.\n\n\n\n"}

It was first launched on the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Queen Alexandra from her native Denmark to the United Kingdom. The Queen requested that the anniversary be marked by the sale of roses in London to raise funds for her favourite charities.\nThe arrival of Princess Alexandra of Denmark in the United Kingdom for her marriage to the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) in 1863 was a never-to-be-forgotten occasion. This was attributable to the then recent increase in the railway network, the lack of royal occasions in preceding years and the new process of photography, which had made it possible for pictures of the Princess to be sold in shops prior to the arrival. The City of London spent £40,000 on decorations and illuminations, and the result was a tumultuous reception for the bride.\n\nWhen the 50th anniversary of her arrival and wedding came, Queen Alexandra's admirers insisted that it should be celebrated in a special way. A processional drive through the streets of London seemed an obvious choice, but Alexandra wanted an occasion that would help the sick and needy. She developed an idea which would benefit the funds of London hospitals through the sale of artificial wild roses, which were to be made by young women and girls with disabilities at the John Groom Industrial Training Home.\n\nThe day was to be called \"Alexandra Rose Day\", and the initial drive swept Londoners off their feet. The first event raised £32,000 (the equivalent of almost £2 million in 2002 money). The funds raised were a great benefit to hospitals, and the annual drive became an institution, one of the chief attractions of London's summer, with Alexandra the star. By 1920, £775,000 for London hospitals had been raised.\n\nQueen Alexandra's Rose Day continued to be celebrated even after her death in 1925. Rare Autochrome colour photos exist of women selling paper roses with poster billboards and decorated collecting cans in Seaford, East Sussex on the 'Seventeenth Celebration Alexandra Day in memory of H.M Queen Alexandra Saturday June 16, 1928.'\n\nAfter a period of raising money for charities that do not normally get national attention for fundraising, today Alexandra Rose Charities is tackling food poverty in London, most notably through providing vouchers for disadvantaged families to buy fresh fruit and vegetables.\n\nThe Prime Minister traditionally launches the day by being the first to buy a rose.\n\nPrincess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy, Queen Alexandra's great-granddaughter, is the current President of Alexandra Rose Day.\n\n"}

In medicine, genetic susceptibility to a disease refers to a genetic predisposition to a health problem, which may eventually be triggered by particular environmental or lifestyle factors, such as tobacco smoking or diet. Genetic testing is able to identify individuals who are genetically predisposed to certain diseases.\n\nPredisposition is the capacity we are born with to learn things such as language and concept of self. Negative environmental influences may block the predisposition (ability) we have to do some things. Behaviors displayed by animals can be influenced by genetic predispositions. Genetic predisposition towards certain human behaviors is scientifically investigated by attempts to identify patterns of human behavior that seem to be invariant over long periods of time and in very different cultures.\n\nFor example, philosopher Daniel Dennett has proposed that humans are genetically predisposed to have a theory of mind because there has been evolutionary selection for the human ability to adopt the intentional stance. The \"intentional stance\" is a useful behavioral strategy by which humans assume that others have minds like their own. This assumption allows you to predict the behavior of others based on personal knowledge of what you would do.\n\nIn 1951, Hans Eysenck and Donald Prell published an experiment in which identical (monozygotic) and fraternal (dizygotic) twins, ages 11 and 12, were tested for neuroticism.

{"id": "2162544", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2162544", "title": "Port au Port Peninsula", "text": "Port au Port Peninsula\n\nThe Port au Port Peninsula (, Mi'kmaq: \"Kitpu\") is a peninsula in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. Roughly triangular in shape, it is located on the west coast of the island of Newfoundland.\n\nThe peninsula extends into the Gulf of St. Lawrence and is joined to Newfoundland by a narrow isthmus connecting at the town of Port au Port. It is bounded on the south by Bay St. George, the western side by the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and on the northwestern side by Port au Port Bay.\n\nWith a rocky shoreline measuring approximately 130 km in length, the peninsula extends approximately 40 km west from its isthmus to Cape St. George and northwest 50 km to the fingerlike Long Point which by itself is approximately 25 km in length. The eastern shore of the peninsula is irregular, jutting into Port au Port Bay.\n\nThe Port au Port Peninsula is located on the western edge of the heavily eroded Appalachian Mountain chain which runs along Newfoundland's west coast. There are no natural harbours along the peninsula's rocky coastline. The peninsula was once heavily forested but many areas along its shores have been cleared for subsistence farming.\n\nThe southern shore is hilly with the northern shore having a sloping lowland extending to a low rise along the centre of the eastern part of the peninsula. The geological structure is complex with the peninsula's sedimentary strata dating to the middle Cambrian to early Ordovician continental margin, creating a carbonate platform of limestone, shale, and sandstone. The heavily folded geological structure in the area has been identified as having an unknown amount of petroleum reserves.\n\nThe area was named \"Ophor portu\" (port of rest) by Basque fishermen during the 16th-17th centuries. French and Basque fishermen used the west coast of Newfoundland, including the Port au Port Peninsula, for seasonal fishing settlements, however some began permanently inhabiting the area. Mi'kmaq families were also present in the area.\n\nDuring and after the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 and Treaty of Paris in 1763, France retained the right to use of the west coast of the island. This area came to be known as the \"French Shore\" and the Port au Port Peninsula was at its centre.\n\nScattered settlement continued in the area until 1904 when France relinquished its right of use to the \"French Shore\". The Port au Port Peninsula represents the most varied ethnic and linguistic mix in the entire island of Newfoundland, including Mi'kmaq families with the highest proportion of French-speaking settlement on the island (15%).\n\nThe French minority, a mix of Mi'kmaq, Acadian, French and Basque, has had an important influence on the area's culture. Newfoundland's unique folk music has been somewhat influenced by musicians from the Port au Port Peninsula, notably Émile Benoît. Additionally, the area's strong Roman Catholic tradition is reflected in the high visibility accorded to churches throughout the peninsula's communities.\n\nAs the centre of the province's Franco-Newfoundlander community, the peninsula has been designated the only bilingual district on the island of Newfoundland since 1971.\n\nThe Port au Port Peninsula's economy is based on natural resources, namely fishing. Limited forestry takes place in the unsettled areas of the interior and a small amount of subsistence farming takes place along coastal areas. Many residents of the peninsula, particularly the communities at the eastern end near the isthmus, work in nearby Kippens and Stephenville.\n\nBeginning in 1900 a limestone quarrying operation was established at Aguathuna, near the peninsula's isthmus where the Table Head mountain ridge extends from the Lewis Hills. The limestone was used by Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation at a steel mill in Sydney, Nova Scotia. The quarry was closed in 1966 following DOSCO's financial difficulties.\n\nFrom 1941–1966, many people in the eastern end of the peninsula were employed at Ernest Harmon AFB in nearby Stephenville.\n\nFrom the 1970s to present a major limestone quarry began operating at Lower Cove employing 30-40 people.\n\nIn the 1980s-1990s, petroleum companies began exploring the peninsula for oil. Some deposits were discovered in recoverable quantities and limited production wells are in place at some locations. Geologists have estimated that a much larger deposit exists deeper and possibly off shore from the peninsula in the 400-500 billion barrel range, however exploration drilling has not yet confirmed this theory.\n\nA Canadian energy company may soon get the green light to begin drilling for oil off Newfoundland's southwest coast.\nThe Canadian Imperial Venture Corporation (CIVC) is waiting for approval from the federal-provincial oil regulator – the Canada Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board – to drill a test well on Shoal Point, near the Port Au Port Peninsula.\nThe company has been exploring in the area over the last few years. It discovered some oil there in 2008.\n\"At the turn of the century there were several wells on the Port Au Port Peninsula, and Shoal Point, that produced somewhere between 20 to 25 barrels a day,\" said Kirby Mercer, CIVC's vice-president.\n\"Now, we're going in with modern technology, modern tools. So we hope to extract the black gold using modern technology.\"\nMercer said if the company receives approval for a test well and drilling is successful, CIVC hopes the Offshore Petroleum Board will then approve a significant discovery licence. That would bring the company one step closer to establishing an oil-producing well in western Newfoundland.\n\nToday travellers access the area using the Marine Atlantic ferry service to Channel-Port aux Basques or with Sunwing Airlines, Flair Airlines and Provincial Airlines to the Stephenville International Airport.\n\nThe Port au Port Peninsula is reachable by air via the Stephenville International Airport. Offering regular domestic flights all year long. The airport is located east of the region.\n\nThe Port au Port Peninsula is a relatively insular region and contains a collection of approximately 20 communities:\nFollowing Route 460:\n\nFollowing Route 463:\n\nFollowing Route 463 and local roads:\n\n"}

The name is a play on Jesus' Sermon on the Mount and on the artificial hill in Edinburgh called the Mound, on which the Church's Assembly Hall stands, and the fact that Thatcher was preaching to a church and nation that consistently rejected her ideology. She had been invited by the then Moderator of the General Assembly, Duncan Shaw.\n\nIn the address, Thatcher offered a theological justification for her ideas on capitalism and the market economy. Citing a view that \"Christianity is about spiritual redemption, not social reform\", she asserted that the two really should not be separated, but went on to emphasise personal responsibility, also quoting St Paul by saying \"If a man will not work he shall not eat\". Choice played a significant part in Thatcherite reforms and Thatcher claimed choice was also Christian by stating that Christ chose to lay down his life and that all individuals have the God-given right to choose between good and evil. Thatcher also justified her belief in individual salvation by quoting from the hymn \"I Vow to Thee, My Country\" (which was not in the Church of Scotland's hymnary of the time):\n\nThe Margaret Thatcher Foundation, which reproduces the full text of the speech on its website and characterises the nickname \"Sermon on the Mound\" as distasteful, rates it as having key importance as a statement of Thatcher's views on religion, morality, family, social security, welfare, taxation, education, race, immigration, nationality, and civil liberties.\n\n"}

{"id": "2162569", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2162569", "title": "The Perks of Being a Wallflower", "text": "The Perks of Being a Wallflower\n\nThe Perks of Being a Wallflower is a young adult coming-of-age epistolary novel by American writer Stephen Chbosky, which was first published on February 1, 1999, by Pocket Books. Set in the early 1990s, the novel follows Charlie, an introverted observing teenager, through his freshman year of high school in a Pittsburgh suburb. The novel details Charlie's unconventional style of thinking as he navigates between the worlds of adolescence and adulthood, and attempts to deal with poignant questions spurred by his interactions with both his friends and family.\n\nChbosky took five years to develop and publish \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\", creating the characters and other aspects of the story from his own memories. The novel addresses themes permeating adolescence, including introversion, sexuality, drug use, rape, and mental health, while also making several references to other literary works, films, and pop culture in general. Because of the mentioned themes, it was banned in some American schools for its content.\n\nIn 2012, Chbosky adapted and directed a film version starring Logan Lerman, Emma Watson, and Ezra Miller. The film boosted the novel's sales, and the book reached \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list.\n\nCharlie, the 15-year-old protagonist, begins writing letters about his own life to an unknown recipient addressed, \"dear friend.\" In these letters he discusses his first year at high school and his struggles with two traumatic experiences: the suicide of his only middle-school friend, Michael Dobson, and the death of his favorite aunt, Helen.\n\nHis caring English teacher, who encourages Charlie to call him Bill, notices Charlie's passion for reading and writing, and acts as a mentor by assigning him extracurricular books and reports. Although he is a wallflower, Charlie is befriended by two seniors: Patrick and Sam. Patrick is secretly dating Brad, a football player, and Sam is Patrick's stepsister. Charlie quickly develops a consuming crush on Sam and subsequently admits his feelings to her. It is revealed that Sam was sexually abused as a child, and she kisses Charlie to ensure that his first kiss is from someone who truly loves him.\n\nSimilar to his own experience, Charlie witnesses his sister's boyfriend hit her across the face, but she forbids him from telling their parents. He eventually mentions the occurrence to Bill, who tells Charlie's parents about it. Charlie's relationship with his sister rapidly deteriorates and she continues to see her boyfriend against her parents' wishes. Eventually, he discovers that his sister is pregnant and agrees to bring her to an abortion clinic without telling anyone. His sister breaks up with her boyfriend, after which her relationship with Charlie begins to improve significantly.\n\nCharlie is accepted by Sam and Patrick's group of friends and begins experimenting with tobacco, alcohol and other drugs. At a party, Charlie trips on LSD. He cannot control his flashbacks of Aunt Helen, who died in a car crash on her way to buy him a birthday gift. He ends up in the hospital after falling asleep in the snow. At a \"Rocky Horror Picture Show\" performance, Charlie is asked to fill in as Rocky for Sam's boyfriend Craig, who was unable to attend the show that night. Their friend Mary Elizabeth is impressed and asks Charlie to the Sadie Hawkins dance and they enter into a desultory relationship. The relationship ends, however, during a game of truth or dare when Charlie is dared to kiss the prettiest girl in the room. He kisses Sam, and Mary Elizabeth storms out of the room in response. Following this, Patrick suggests that Charlie stay away from Sam for a while, and the rest of the friend group shuns him. Without friends to distract Charlie from his thoughts and struggles, his flashbacks of Aunt Helen return.\n\nPatrick and Brad's relationship is discovered by Brad's abusive father, and Brad disappears from school for a few days. Upon returning, Brad is cold and mean toward Patrick, while Patrick attempts to reconnect with him. However, when Brad derogatorily attacks Patrick's sexuality in public, Patrick physically attacks Brad until other football players join in and gang up on Patrick. Charlie joins in the fight to defend Patrick, and breaks it up, regaining the respect of Sam and her friends. Patrick begins spending most of his time with Charlie, and Patrick kisses Charlie impulsively but then apologizes. Charlie is sympathetic because he understands that Patrick is still recovering from his romance with Brad. Soon Patrick sees Brad engaging with a stranger in the park and Patrick is able to move on from the relationship.\n\nAs the school year ends, Charlie is anxious about losing his older friends—especially Sam, who is leaving for a summer college-preparatory program and has learned that her boyfriend cheated on her. When Charlie helps her pack, they talk about his feelings for her; she is angry that he never acted on them. They begin to engage sexually, but Charlie suddenly grows inexplicably uncomfortable and stops Sam. Charlie begins to realize that his sexual contact with Sam has stirred up repressed memories of him being molested by his Aunt Helen as a little boy. Charlie shows signs of PTSD from the incident and the revelation of his abuse helps the reader understand his views of relationships and love.\n\nIn an epilogue, Charlie is discovered by his parents in a catatonic state and does not show any movement despite being hit reluctantly by his father. After being admitted to a mental hospital, it is revealed that Helen actually sexually abused him when he was young—memories he had unconsciously repressed. This psychological damage explains his flashbacks and derealization phases throughout the book. In two months Charlie is released, and Sam and Patrick visit him. In the epilogue, Sam, Patrick, and Charlie go through the tunnel again and Charlie stands up and exclaims that he feels infinite.\n\nCharlie eventually comes to terms with his past: \"Even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there\". Charlie decides to \"participate\" in life, and his letter-writing ends.\n\nChbosky incorporated both fictional ideas and personal experiences to the novel, making it semi-biographical. After five years with these elements in mind, he had the idea of writing the novel during a difficult period in his life. He was experiencing an unpleasant breakup of his own, which led him to ask, \"Why good people let themselves get treated so badly?\" The author tried to answer the question with the sentence \"we accept the love we think we deserve\". This quote references the struggle of finding self love, encompassing one's life and hope for the future, and not just romantic love.\n\nThe story began when Chbosky was in school, evolving from another book on which he was working. In that book he wrote the sentence, \"I guess that's just one of the perks of being a wallflower\", which led him to realize \"that somewhere in that ... was the kid I was really trying to find.\" Chbosky began writing the novel in the summer of 1996 while he was in college, and within ten weeks he completed the story. He rewrote it into two more drafts, concluding the published version in the summer of 1998.\n\nCharlie was loosely based on Chbosky himself. In the novel, Chbosky included much of his own memories from the time he lived in Pittsburgh. The other characters were manifestations of people Chbosky had known throughout his life; Chbosky focused on people's struggles and what they are passionate about, attempting to pin down the very nature of each of the characters. The characters of Sam and Patrick were an \"amalgamate and celebration\" of several people Chbosky has met; Sam was based on girls who confided in him, and Patrick was \"all the kids I knew who were gay and finding their way to their own identity.\"\n\nThe idea of anonymous letters came from a real experience; during his senior year in high school, Chbosky wrote an anonymous letter to Stewart Stern about how \"Rebel Without a Cause\" had influenced him. A year and a half later, Stern found Chbosky and became his mentor. By using a series of letters from Charlie to an anonymous character, Chbosky found \"the most intimate way\" to talk directly to the reader. He thought the letters would help him keep the story cohesive, \"to convey the highs and lows of being young—one day, you're on top of the world and you've had the greatest of times\".\n\nCritics have identified primary themes of teenage reality and nostalgia. According to David Edelstein of the \"New York Magazine\", Chbosky captures the \"feeling you belong when among friends, yet you'd soon be alone\" and notes that \"the pain of loss ... [is] almost as intense as the bliss ... it's nostalgia with an emphasis on nostos, pain [sic].\" Marty Beckerman of \"Word Riot\" said that \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\" connects with young people because its scenes are \"so universal and happen to so many teenagers.\" Chbosky wanted to convey respect for teenagers, to \"validate and respect and celebrate what [teenagers] are going through every day\", and said the novel is for \"anyone who's felt like an outcast.\"\n\nRead by all ages, \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\" is targeted at a teenage audience. The book addresses a range of themes dispassionately. These themes include drugs, friendship, body image, first love, suicide, eating disorders and sexuality. Chbosky appreciates the importance of entertainment in adolescence: \"Books, songs, and movies are more than entertainment when we're young. They help all of us discover who we are, what we believe, and what we hope our life can be.\" As such, the book contains several cultural references across all mediums: musically the book references The Smiths and Fleetwood Mac, literarily the book references \"This Side of Paradise\", \"On the Road\", \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", \"Hamlet\", \"The Stranger\" and \"Walden\", and theatrically the book references \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\".\n\n\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\" was first published on February 1, 1999 by Pocket Books through its MTV Books imprint. It became the subsidiary's best-selling book with 100,000 copies in print as of 2000, and was included on school reading lists and gathered a cult following. By 2012, the novel had been published in 16 countries in 13 languages, and that same year it placed at number 16 on NPR's list of the \"100 Best-Ever Teen Novels\".\n\nCritical response was mixed; \"Publishers Weekly\" called the novel \"trite\", dealing with \"standard teenage issues\" in which \"Chbosky infuses a droning insistence on Charlie's supersensitive disposition.\" Although \"Kirkus Reviews\" said it had \"the right combination of realism and uplift\", the reviewer criticized Chbosky's \"rip-off\" of J. D. Salinger's \"The Catcher in the Rye\". Although other reviewers made similar comparisons, Chbosky said he \"was not trying to mimic [Salinger's] style as a writer\"; he saw \"how readers could compare Charlie to Salinger's Holden Caulfield, but \"they are very different people with unique problems and perspectives\". More positive was Francisca Goldsmith of the \"School Library Journal\", who said the novel \"cleverly\" makes the readers the recipients of Charlie's letters, and it \"will engage teen readers for years to come.\" Common Sense Media's Kate Pavao praised its relevant themes for teenagers: \"Readers will find themselves quickly feeling sorry for the protagonist and worrying about him throughout his transformative journey.\" For \"The A.V. Club\", Marah Eakin wrote that although for an adult \"\"Perks\" suffers from an overabundance of pure, raw angst ... unlike some more arrested development-friendly young adult fare like \"Harry Potter\", \"Perks\" speaks to a more specific age range and does it well.\"\n\n\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\" has appeared six times on the American Library Association's list of 10 most-frequently-challenged books for its content. A Wisconsin school board refused to ban the book, angering local parents. The Glen Ellyn District 41 school board in suburban Chicago unanimously voted to reinstate the novel after it was removed from eighth-grade classrooms at Hadley Junior High School because of a parent's objection to its sexual content. Groups like PABBIS (Parents Against Bad Books in School) work to restrict literature considered \"controversial\" from being accessed by younger children. The group believes these \"bad books\" should be moved to the adult section. In 2009, \"Perks\" was repeatedly challenged for descriptions of masturbation, sexually explicit conduct, drug use, and talk of suicide, and there have been multiple pushes across the United States to move this literary work from the children and young adults section to the adult section. Parents have raised issues with the novel for its \"pornographic\" content and \"vulgarity,\" but others have argued that the book deals with real and common teen issues concerned with growing up, so it presents a truthful viewpoint. Issues are also raised surrounding the book's themes of homosexuality, as well as a \"glorification\" of the use of drugs and alcohol. In an interview, Chbosky said that he knew of two school boards which have banned the book (in Massachusetts and on Long Island). Since he \"didn't write it to be a controversial book,\" he was \"surprised\" by the bans.\n\nSince he wrote \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\", Chbosky aspired to adapt it into a film, calling this a \"lifelong dream of his\". After the publication of the novel, the author said he received film offers, refusing them because he \"owed the fans a movie that was worthy of their love for the book\". In 2010 Mr. Mudd began developing a film version, and the author was signed to write and direct the film by producers John Malkovich, Lianne Halfon and Russell Smith. The film, shot in the Pittsburgh area from May 9 to June 29, 2011, starred Logan Lerman as Charlie, Emma Watson as Sam, Ezra Miller as Patrick, and Nina Dobrev as Charlie's sister, Candace.\n\nWith the announcement of a film adaptation, the novel received more attention; its sales increased from 88,847 copies in 2011 to 425,933 in 2012, and it reached the \"New York Times\" bestseller lists. It entered the Children's Paperback Books category on the June 23, 2012 list, and had 1.5 million copies in print in November 2012. As of May 11, 2014 it appeared on \"The New York Times\" top 10 list for the 71st non-consecutive week, and was in the top 15 on the November 23 list.\n\nThe film premiered on September 8, 2012 at the Toronto International Film Festival, and was released theatrically in the United States by Summit Entertainment on September 21. According to Metacritic it has received \"generally favorable reviews\", with an average of 67 out of 100 based on 36 reviews. Rotten Tomatoes reported an 86% approval rate, based on 153 reviews. The film grossed over $33 million worldwide from a $13 million production budget.\n\nSome scenes were omitted from the film adaptation: In the book, Charlie's parents are notified by Bill that Candace is being abused by her boyfriend, to which his parents take direct intervention in the abusive relationship in the book. Also omitted from the film is the side-story where Candace gets pregnant by her abusive boyfriend and is accompanied by Charlie to the abortion clinic. In addition, one of the more important pieces of the book, the poem, was deleted from the film before its release. There is a special features section on the DVD with scenes that were shot but didn't make it into the film.\n\n"}

He was educated first in Kensington and then in Westminster.\n\nAfter leaving Westminster School, he was apprenticed, in 1802, to his brother, an apothecary, with the view of adopting the profession of medicine.\n\nHe studied medicine at Great Windmill Street Medical School and at St George's Hospital, before being drawn to chemistry following a meeting with Humphry Davy. He then began to lecture in chemistry, based on a sound knowledge of which he acquired in his spare time.\n\nIn 1811 he published the first of what were to be two very influential articles on the measurement of alcohol in fermented drinks, including wine, cider and ale. Until that point chemists had only been able to measure alcohol in distilled drinks (brandy, gin etc.), which many early temperance reformers had assumed to be a poison. By showing that alcohol was present in fermented drinks from the start (rather than being a by-product of the distillation process), Brande undermined the long-standing view that spirits were toxic, while wine and beer were more wholesome. These findings were later propagated by the Temperance movement and used to justify total alcoholic abstinence, or teetotalism.\n\nIn 1812 he was appointed professor of chemistry to the Apothecaries' Society, and delivered a course of lectures before the Board of Agriculture in place of Sir Humphry Davy, whom in the following year he succeeded in the chair of chemistry at the Royal Institution, London. In 1821 he was the first to isolate the element lithium, which he did by electrolysis of lithium oxide.\n\nFrom about 1823 onwards, Brande worked increasingly with the Royal Mint, eventually becoming Superintendent of the Coining and Die Department.\n\nBrande's \"Manual of Chemistry\", first published in 1819, enjoyed wide popularity, and among other works he brought out a \"Dictionary of Science, Literature and Art\" in 1842. He was working on a new edition when he died at Tunbridge Wells.\n\nHe contributed articles to \"Rees's Cyclopædia\" on Chemistry, but the topics are not known.\n\nIn 1834, 1836, 1839, 1842, 1844, 1847 and 1850 Brande was invited to deliver the Royal Institution Christmas Lecture on \"Chemistry\"; \"Chemistry of the Gases\"; \"The Chemistry of the Atmosphere and the Ocean\"; \"The Chemistry of the Non-Metallic Elements\"; \"The Chemistry of the Gases\"; \"The Elements of Organic Chemistry\" and \"The Chemistry of Coal\" respectively.\n\n\nHe married Anna Frederica Hatchett, daughter of the eminent chemist Charles Hatchett in July 1818.\n\nBrande died in Tunbridge Wells in 1866, and is buried in West Norwood Cemetery, London (grave 1177, square 98).\n\n"}

{"id": "2162595", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2162595", "title": "Matty Groves", "text": "Matty Groves\n\n\"Matty Groves\", also known as \"Little Musgrave and Lady Barnard\" or \"Little Musgrave\", is a ballad probably originating in Northern England that describes an adulterous tryst between a young man and a noblewoman that is ended when the woman's husband discovers and kills them. This song exists in many textual variants and has several variant names. The song dates to at least 1613, and under the title \"Little Musgrave and Lady Barnard\" is one of the Child Ballads collected by 19th-century American scholar Francis James Child.\n\nLittle Musgrave (or Matty Groves, Little Matthew Grew and other variations) goes to church on a holy day either \"the holy word to hear\" or \"to see fair ladies there\". He sees Lord Barnard's wife, the fairest lady there, and realises that she is attracted to him. She invites him to spend the night with her, and he agrees when she tells him her husband is away from home. Her page goes to find Lord Barnard (Arnel, Daniel, Arnold, Donald, Darnell, Darlington) and tells him that Musgrave is in bed with his wife. Lord Barnard promises the page a large reward if he is telling the truth and to hang him if he is lying. Lord Barnard and his men ride to his home, where he surprises the lovers in bed. Lord Barnard tells Musgrave to dress because he doesn't want to be accused of killing a naked man. Musgrave says he dare not because he has no weapon, and Lord Barnard gives him the better of two swords. In the subsequent duel Little Musgrave wounds Lord Barnard, who then kills him. Lord Barnard then asks his wife whether she still prefers Little Musgrave to him and when she says she would prefer a kiss from the dead man's lips to her husband and all his kin, he kills her. He then says he regrets what he has done and orders the lovers to be buried in a single grave, with the lady at the top because \"she came of the better kin\". In some versions Barnard is hanged, or kills himself, or finds his own infant son dead in his wife's body. Many versions omit one or more parts of the story.\n\nIt has been speculated that the original names of the characters, Little Musgrave and Lady Barnard, come from place names in the north of England (specifically Little Musgrave in Westmorland and Barnard Castle in County Durham). The place name \"Bucklesfordbury,\" found in both English and American versions of the song, is of uncertain origin.\n\nSome versions of the ballad include elements of an alba, a poetic form in which lovers part after spending a night together.\n\n\nThere are few broadside versions. There are three different printings in the Bodleian Library's Broadside Ballads Online, all dating from the second half of the seventeenth century. One, \"The lamentable Ditty of the little Mousgrove, and the Lady Barnet\" from the collection of Anthony Wood, has a handwritten note by Wood on the reverse stating that \"the protagonists were alive in 1543\".\n\nChild published 14 examples.\n\nThe Roud Folk Song Index contains over 300 instances of this ballad, and shows that the ballad has been collected mostly in North America: 113 versions listed in Roud were found in the USA, with the bulk in North Carolina (24), the Virginias (24), Kentucky (23), New England (16) and Tennessee (9). In Canada, 18 versions were found, the majority in Nova Scotia. Scotland produced 9 versions, and England only 2. Cecil Sharp is listed as the collector for 22 of the versions.\n\nA number of songs and tales collected in the Caribbean are based on, or refer to, the ballad.\n\nSome of the versions of the song subsequently recorded differ from Child's catalogued version. The earliest published version appeared in 1658 (see \"Literature\" section below). A copy was also printed on a broadside by Henry Gosson, who is said to have printed between 1607 and 1641. Some variation occurs in where Matty is first seen; sometimes at church, sometimes playing ball.\n\nMatty Groves also shares some mid-song stanzas with the ballad \"Fair Margaret and Sweet William\" (Child 74, Roud 253).\n\nOther names for the ballad:\n\nThe earliest known reference to the ballad is in Beaumont and Fletcher's 1613 play \"The Knight of the Burning Pestle\":\n\nAnd some they whistled, and some they sung,<BR>\nHey, down, down!<BR>\nAnd some did loudly say,<BR>\nEver as the Lord Barnet's horn blew,<BR>\nAway, Musgrave, away!\n\nAl Hine's 1961 novel \"Lord Love a Duck\" opens and closes with excerpts from the ballad, and borrows the names Musgrave and Barnard for two characters.\n\nDeborah Grabien's third book in the \"Haunted Ballad\" series, \"Matty Groves\" (2005), puts a different spin on the ballad.\n\n\nVersions of some performers could be mentioned as the most notable or successful, including the ones by Jean Ritchie or Martin Carthy.\nIn the film Songcatcher (2000), the song is performed by Emmy Rossum and Janet McTeer.\n\nIn season 5 episode 2, \"Gently with Class\" (2012), of the British television series \"Inspector George Gently\", the song is performed by Ebony Buckle, playing the role of singer Ellen Mallam in that episode, singing it as \"Matty Groves\".\n\nIn 1943, the English composer Benjamin Britten used this folk song as the basis of a choral piece entitled \"The Ballad of Little Musgrave and Lady Barnard\".\n\n\"The Big Musgrave\", a parody by the Kipper Family appears on their LP \"Fresh Yesterday\" (DAM CD 020) (1988). The hero in this version is called Big Fatty Groves.\n\nFrank Hayes created a talking blues version of Matty Groves called \"Like A Lamb To The Slaughter,\" which won the 1994 Pegasus award for \"Best Risqué Song.\"\n\n\nThe previous and next Child Ballads:\n\n"}

While making his third film, \"Prapancha Pash\", he met and fell in love with Devika Rani, a great-grandniece of the Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore. Before this film was complete, he married her.\n\nAt Bombay Talkies studio, Rai partnered with Sashadhar Mukherjee, and Mukherjee's brother in law worked as a technician in the studio. Due to suspected romantic liaisons between his wife and the leading man in one film, Himanshu sacked the leading man and cast the gawky, awkward-looking and reluctant brother-in-law Ashok Kumar as the leading man. Kumar went on to have a successful career in films.\n\nAfter Rai's death, there was a struggle for studio control. His widow Devika Rani was in conflict with Sashadhar Mukherjee. Eventually there was dual control and alternate production of films by the two camps. During this era Mukherjee produced the studio's biggest hit \"Kismet\" in 1943. Then Mukherjee broke away to form Filmistan Studio in partnership, and Devika Rani, fully in charge of the studio, did not have as much success.\n\nIn 1945, Devika Rani married Svetoslav Roerich and moved away from Bombay and films. Ashok Kumar and Mukherjee made a bid to revive Bombay talkies and produced one big hit in \"Mahal\". Eventually the studio shut down and is now a decrepit property in Malad.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

One morning, Jones discovers a frozen corpse (Steve Fall) in his backyard, and soon meets Jackie Bangs (Valerie Buhagiar), a tough and mysterious roadie who claims the dead man is her brother.\n\nJackie's real intention is to use the body, a vagrant unknown to anyone in town, to smuggle stolen drugs into the United States. She convinces Pokey to use his parents' car, which has not been driven in decades, to drive her to New Orleans to bury her brother. So Jackie and Pokey set out along Highway 61, coffin strapped to the top of the car, and follow Bob Dylan's famous U.S. Highway 61 south through the heart of the United States. They are pursued by Mr. Skin (Earl Pastko), who believes he is Satan and wants to claim the body because the dead man sold Mr. Skin his soul.\n\nPeter Breck is fourth-billed as Mr. Watson, the \"stage-mom\" father of three girls: Mississippi (Missy), Minnesota (Minnie), and Louisiana (Louise). The film also includes cameo appearances by Tav Falco, Jello Biafra, and Art Bergmann.\n\nThe film's soundtrack album includes songs by Bourbon Tabernacle Choir, Rita Chiarelli, Nash the Slash, Acid Test, Jellyfishbabies, and Tom Jones.

The Reaction is named after the chemists Francis Robert Japp and Felix Klingemann.\n\nThe hydrazone products of the Japp–Klingemann reaction are most often used as intermediates in syntheses of more complex organic molecules. For example, a phenylhydrazone product can be heated in the presence of strong acid to produce an indole via the Fischer indole synthesis.\n\nTo illustrate the mechanism, the Japp-Klingemann ester variation will be considered. The first step is the deprotonation of the β-keto-ester. The nucleophilic addition of the enolate anion 2 to the diazonium salt produces the azo compound 3. Intermediate 3 has been isolated in rare cases. However, in most cases, the hydrolysis of intermediate 3 produces a tetrahedral intermediate 4, which quickly decomposes to release the carboxylic acid 6.

He was appointed Official Aeronaut of France.\n\nGarnerin was born in Paris. He was captured by British troops during the first phase of the French Revolutionary Wars 1792–1797, turned over to the Austrians and held as a prisoner of war in Buda in Hungary for three years.\n\nGarnerin, a student of the ballooning pioneer professor Jacques Charles, was involved with the flight of hot air balloons, and worked with his older brother Jean-Baptiste-Olivier Garnerin (1766–1849) in most of his ballooning activities. Eventually he was appointed Official Aeronaut of France.\n\nGarnerin began experiments with early parachutes based on umbrella-shaped devices and carried out the first frameless parachute descent (in the gondola) with a silk parachute on 22 October 1797 at Parc Monceau, Paris (1st Brumaire, Year VI of the Republican calendar). Garnerin's first parachute was made of white canvas with a diameter of approximately 23 feet (7 m). The umbrella was closed before he ascended, with a pole running down its center and a rope running through a tube in the pole, which connected it to the balloon. Garnerin rode in a basket attached to the bottom of the parachute; at a height of approximately he severed the rope that connected his parachute to the balloon. The balloon continued skyward while Garnerin, with his basket and parachute, fell. The basket swung violently during descent, then bumped and scraped when it landed, but Garnerin emerged uninjured.\n\nGarnerin went on to stage regular tests and demonstrations at Parc Monceau, Paris, on 22 October, 1797, which became a cause célèbre when he announced in 1798 that his next flight would include a woman as a passenger. Although the public and press were in favour, he was forced to appear in front of officials of the Central Bureau of Police to justify his project. They were concerned about the effect that reduced air pressure might have on the organs of the delicate female body and loss of consciousness, plus the moral implications of flying in such close proximity. Unsatisfied with Garnerin's responses, the police issued an injunction against him, forbidding the ascent on the grounds that the young woman was committing herself to the venture without any idea of the possible outcome. After further consultation with both the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of the Police the injunction was overturned on the grounds that \"there was no more scandal in seeing two people of different gender ascend in a balloon than it is to see them jump into a carriage.\" They also agreed that the decision of the woman showed proof of her confidence in the experiment and a degree of personal intrepidity.\n\nCitoyenne Henri had already been chosen, so when the ban was lifted Garnerin was ready to proceed. He advertised the ascent in \"L'Ami des Lois\" (a Parisian newspaper published from 1795–1798) :\n\nOn 8 July 1798 a large number of spectators gathered in the Parc Monceau to witness the ascent. By all accounts Citoyenne Henri was young and beautiful, and she and Garnerin took several turns around the park to the applause of the crowd before she was assisted into the basket of the balloon by the astronomer, Jérôme Lalande. The balloon trip passed without incident and the journey ended at Goussainville about to the north of Paris.\n\nAndré-Jacques held the position of Official Aeronaut of France, so with his wife Jeanne Geneviève he visited England in 1802 during the Peace of Amiens and the couple completed a number of demonstration flights. In the evening of 21 September, 1802, André-Jacques ascended in his hydrogen balloon from the Volunteer Ground in North Audley Street, Grosvenor Square and made a parachute descent to a field near St Pancras. This gave rise to the English popular ballad:\n\nHe also made his second English balloon ascent with Edward Hawke Locker on 5 July, 1802 from Lord's Cricket Ground, travelling the 17 miles (27.4 km) from there to Chingford in just over 15 minutes and carrying a letter of introduction signed by the Prince Regent to give to anyone should he crash land. However, when the war between France and Great Britain resumed they were forced to pack up and return to the continent where, on 3–4 October 1803, he covered a distance of 245 miles (395 km) between Paris and Clausen, Germany, with his balloon.\n\nIn most of his ballooning activities Garnerin worked with his older brother Jean-Baptiste-Olivier Garnerin (1766–1849).\nHis student Jeanne Geneviève Labrosse, who later became his wife, was both a balloonist and the first female parachutist. Labrosse first flew on 10 November 1798, one of the earliest women to fly in a balloon, and on 12 October 1799, Labrosse was the first woman to parachute, from an altitude of 900 meters.\n\nHis paternal niece Elisa Garnerin, (born 1791), learned to fly balloons at age 15 and made 39 professional parachute descents from 1815 to 1836 in Italy, Spain, Russia, Germany, and France.\n\nGarnerin's first parachute jump was commemorated by Google in a Google Doodle on 22 October, 2013.\n\n\n\n"}

It currently has a capacity of 17,500 with terracing and a members area holding 750, though capacity was capped at 10,000 for Fremantle AFLW games. Fremantle Oval was originally used for cricket, but in 1895 hosted its first game of Australian rules football and Australian Football quickly became the main attraction leading to the development of the ground. It is located between the Fremantle Hospital, Fremantle Markets and the Fremantle Prison.\n\nSouth Fremantle Football Club, the \"Bulldogs\", train and play their home WAFL matches at the ground and are one of the few sporting organisations in Western Australia to own their club rooms freehold, rather than on a long-term lease. Additionally, the oval is the primary home ground of the Fremantle Dockers women's team. The ground was also the training and administrative home of the Fremantle Football Club until February 2017, and has also hosted pre-season matches featuring Fremantle. \n\nOriginally known as Barracks Green Field, the area was used by the Pensioner Guards who were used primarily as guards for Fremantle Prison which house convict and ticket of leave prisoners. In 1861 Manning raised a Volunteer defence force, who used the ground for manoeuvers, parades with volunteer bands providing entertainment.\n\nAs Australian Rules Football developed in the late 19th century the ground became the base for the Fremantle Football Club and hosted many early WAFL as well as interstate games. Facilities remained relatively basic until 1897 when the Victoria Pavilion was built. The large stately structure provided seating for 500 people as well as club rooms located in the basement.\n\nBy 1901 South Fremantle Football Club and East Fremantle Football Club were established as regular cotenants of Fremantle Oval. The oval also hosted Fremantle Cricket Club and a cycling track that was in regular use throughout the year.\n\nIn March 1907 Western Australia hosted New South Wales in the oval's only recorded first-class cricket match. New South Wales had three players (Warren Bardsley, Charles Macartney, and Roy Minnett) who had represented Australia in Test cricket whilst Western Australia had one (Ernie Jones). Western Australia won by 5 runs. \n\nEast Fremantle Football Club vacated the ground in 1950, moving to new premises, located at Moss Street in East Fremantle.\n\nIn 1954 the oval was used for a ceremonial parade as part of Queen Elizabeth II's first visit to Fremantle.\n\nThe Cycling Track and Cricket Pitch were removed in the 1960s due to the increasing demands of WAFL football.\n\nThe ground remained relatively unchanged until 1968 when the South Fremantle Football Club acquired a portion of land freehold at the hospital end of the ground for the construction of social club, members pavilion and players changerooms.\n\nFurther improvements were made to the ground with the growing demands of larger WAFL crowds in the 1960s and 1970s. These included a shelter behind the goals at the prison end of the ground and a large one at the hospital end of the ground named the Doig Pavilion. A three level press box was constructed adjacent to the Victoria Pavilion. The eastern outer area of the ground was also fully terraced with concrete kerbing so as to allow for greater crowd capacity.\nThe late 1970s witnessed a peak in crowd attendance at Fremantle Oval with over 23,000 people attending the Foundation Day Derby in 1979. Large crowds continued to flock to the ground into the early 1980s with the WAFL proving to be the most popular spectator sport in the State.\n\nFrom 1980 to 1985 the oval hosted Motorcross racing during the summer. Noise complaints from nearby Fremantle Hospital and the availability of more suitable venues lead to the racing moving.\n\nIn 1986 the ground underwent its most dramatic structural change with the works related to the Parry Street extension, demolishing the historic Henderson Street and South Terrace entrance gates as well reducing the capacity of the ground on the western side. New entrance gates were built on Parry Street, however the South Terrace gates were never replaced.\n\nIn 1987, the entry of the West Coast Eagles into the expanded VFL competition lead to a dramatic decline in WAFL attendances. In 1995 this was compounded by the entry of the Fremantle Dockers into the AFL. Attendances dropped from an average of 8000 in the early 1980s to 3000 in the early 90s and 2000 in 1999.\n\nThe Fremantle Dockers established a base at the oval and in 1999 constructed a new training facility. This required the demolition of the Doig Pavilion and the levelling of the historic hospital end hill area that had once been one of the most popular positions for the general public to watch football matches from.\n\nIn 2017, the Dockers AFLW team began playing most home games at the oval. The oval also continues to host WAFL matches as well as AFL pre season games.\n\nIt is also used a venue for conferences, rock concerts (including the Big Day Out) and exhibitions.\n\n23,109, when South Fremantle beat East Fremantle on 4 June 1979.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2162692", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2162692", "title": "Rapid thermal processing", "text": "Rapid thermal processing\n\nRapid thermal processing (RTP) is a semiconductor manufacturing process which heats silicon wafers to high temperatures (over 1,000 °C) on a timescale of several seconds or less. During cooling, however, wafer temperatures must be brought down slowly to prevent dislocations and wafer breakage due to thermal shock. Such rapid heating rates are often attained by high intensity lamps or lasers. These processes are used for a wide variety of applications in semiconductor manufacturing including dopant activation, thermal oxidation, metal reflow and chemical vapor deposition.\n\nOne of the key challenges in rapid thermal processing is accurate measurement and control of the wafer temperature. Monitoring the ambient with a thermocouple has only recently become feasible, in that the high temperature ramp rates prevent the wafer from coming to thermal equilibrium with the process chamber. One temperature control strategy involves \"in situ\" pyrometry to effect real time control. Used for melting iron for welding purposes.\n\nRapid thermal anneal (RTA) is a subset of Rapid Thermal Processing. It is a process used in semiconductor device fabrication which consists of heating a single wafer at a time in order to affect its electrical properties. Unique heat treatments are designed for different effects. Wafers can be heated in order to activate dopants, change film-to-film or film-to-wafer substrate interfaces, densify deposited films, change states of grown films, repair damage from ion implantation, move dopants or drive dopants from one film into another or from a film into the wafer substrate.\n\nRapid thermal anneals are performed by equipment that heats a single wafer at a time using either lamp based heating, a hot chuck, or a hot plate that a wafer is brought near. Unlike furnace anneals they are short in duration, processing each wafer in several minutes.\n\nTo achieve short annealing times and quick throughput, sacrifices are made in temperature and process uniformity, temperature measurement and control, and wafer stress.\n\nRecently, RTP-like processing has found applications in another rapidly growing field—solar cell fabrication. RTP-like processing, in which an increase in the temperature of the semiconductor sample is produced by the absorption of the optical flux, is now used for a host of solar cell fabrication steps, including phosphorus diffusion for N/P junction formation and impurity gettering, hydrogen diffusion for impurity and defect passivation, and formation of screen-printed contacts using Ag-ink for the front and Al-ink for back contacts, respectively.\n\n"}
{"id": "2162702", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2162702", "title": "Half-Jew", "text": "Half-Jew\n\nThe term Halbjude (English: Half-Jew) is a derogatory term for people with a non-Jewish and a Jewish parent. The overwhelming majority of the so-called half-Jews were legally classified as \"first-degree Jewish hybrids\" during the National Socialist era. Occasionally, the term was used even before the National Socialist era. Within Judaism the term half Jew is unusual, since it only knows \"whole\" Jews, namely born into the cultural community (\"Jewish is he who has a Jewish mother\") or converted by Giur.\n\nDuring the National Socialist era, half-Jews was not a legal term. The term was not used in the Nuremberg Race Laws and the related ordinances. In 1941 the keyword half-Jew was included in the Duden for the first time: The group of \"Jewish half-breeds\" was further divided into \"Jewish half-breeds of the first degree\" with two Jewish grandparents and \"Jewish half-breeds of the second degree\" with one Jewish grandparent. However, first-degree hybrids were classified in different categories, despite the assumption of the same \"biological-racial ancestry\": They were not regarded as \"hybrids\" but as \"full Jews\" if they belonged to the Jewish religious community, were married to a Jew or married a Jew after 1935. The term \"Geltungsjude\" was later coined for this group of \"half-Jews\".\n\nThis differentiated classification, which is blurred by the term \"Halbjude\", was of existential importance for those affected. If they were classified unfavourably, they were not admitted to university; they were forced to work at an early stage or were refused a marriage permit. During the Second World War, in marital union with a \"full Jew\", \"half-Jews\" classified as \"Jews of Geltungsjuden\" were deported with their spouses to ghettos or extermination camps. This danger also threatened \"half-Jewish\" children if the non-Jewish spouse had converted to the Jewish faith, and even if the spouses separated again to spare the children persecution. This is meticulously documented using the example of a family from the Weimar-Apolda-Jena region.\n\nNational Socialists tried - as discussed at the Wannsee Conference - to classify all \"half-Jews\" legally as \"full Jews\" and to deport them. The fact that many \"half-Jews\" were also \"half-Christians\" was always ignored.\n\nIn the occupied Eastern territories, \"half-Jews\" were included in the extermination process indiscriminately like \"full Jews\". The Jewish Department at the Reich Main Security Office attempted to influence the controversial decision-making process within the Reich by also creating facts in the Western occupation areas. In August 1941 Adolf Eichmann, in agreement with Arthur Seyß-Inquart, decided to equate the \"half-Jews\" living in the Netherlands with the \"full Jews\" and to deport them. As of May 1942, \"half-Jews\" were also obliged to wear the Jewish star there.\n\nThe term \"Halbjude\" was used by various people even after the war. Therefore Ignaz Bubis criticized 1999:\n\nThe use of the term Halbjude has also established itself in the English-speaking world as \"half-Jewish\" or \"part-Jewish\", whereby the more scientific term \"Beta Gershom\" is already mentioned in the Bible. In other languages, the word \"Father-Jew\", introduced by Andreas Burnier in 1995, has since spread, marking the fact that the father is a Jew, but not the mother. This term is related to the provisions of the Halakha, according to which Jewish religious affiliation is usually derived by birth from a Jewish mother.\n\nThere are few places where the term \"Halbjude\" is used historically. The unpopular ruler Herod was insulted as a \"half-Jew\" because his family came from Idumäa, an area that had been forcibly converted to Judaism. Since he was crowned king of Judea by Rome, the term \"half-Jewish\" can be interpreted as a vague, derogatory term for \"Jew, but not serving Jewish interests\", similar to later in other contexts \"house-neger\" as opposed to \"field-neger\" in Malcolm X.\n\nIn 1881, the anti-Semite Eugen Dühring clearly used the term The Jewish Question as a question of race, morals and culture as a derogatory hereditary biological term in his writing \"Die Judenfrage\".\n"}

Also known as Alexander Wyant, A. H. Wyant, he was active as an artist in Arkville, New York, and Keene Valley, New York, among other places.\n\nAlexander Wyant was born at Port Washington, Ohio. He started painting beside the Ohio River when he was in Cincinnati, Ohio. A landscape painter in the style of George Inness, whom he later met in New York City. His early paintings followed closely the Hudson River School tradition, while the later—infused with low-key colors, atmospheric features and poetic interpretation—are representative of tonalism.\n\nRaised in Defiance, Ohio, Alexander H. Wyant worked during his teens as a sign painter in nearby Port Washington. In 1857 he was impressed with some paintings by George Inness at an exhibition in Cincinnati and soon left for New York to meet Inness. After returning to Cincinnati, Wyant secured the support of Nicholas Longworth and went to study in New York in 1860. He went on a trip that started in Paris in 1860 where he saw Corot and Dupré's works before moving on to Germany.\n\nAfter an interlude of two years in Cincinnati, he moved back to New York City in 1863. He exhibited for the first time at the National Academy of Design in 1864 and was elected an associate there in 1868 and an academician in 1869. Wyant went abroad in 1865, studying for a few months with the Norwegian painter Hans Gude in Düsseldorf and Karlsruhe, Germany, and making brief stops in England and Ireland before settling again in New York. After 1866 Wyant gradually shifted toward a more fluid handling of paint, with increasing reliance on a palette emphasizing shades of white, gray, and the earth colors. From 1867 he exhibited his watercolors almost annually and was instrumental in the founding of the American Watercolor Society in 1878.\n\nA partial stroke while on a government expedition to Arizona and New Mexico in 1873 led to paralysis of his right arm. Between 1874 and 1880 he worked in his studio in New York City, teaching himself to paint with his left hand. After his marriage in 1880, he began to spend most of his time in Keene Valley, New York. He moved in 1889 to Arkville, New York (in the Catskills). He frequently painted in the Adirondacks as well as in the Catskills. He died in 1892 in New York City shortly after completing \"Arkville Autumn Landscape,\" his last painting. He was only moderately appreciated during his lifetime, though after his death his works were eagerly sought for.\n\nWyant's signature style was developed slowly and not without several false starts along the way. Special contributions came from his initial contact with Inness shortly after that artist's sojourn in France; the startling revelations disclosed to Wyant by his study of John Constable and J. M. W. Turner and his stroke in 1873, which accelerated the artist's movement away from the sort of detailed examination of natural facts that one finds, for example, in his well-known, \"Mohawk Valley,\" in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In his later years Wyant's solitary, introspective mood came to blend more closely than ever with his landscapes, especially those from the Arkville area at the Pakatakan Artists Colony, where a kindred spirit, J. F. Murphy, also worked.\n\nHe was a member of the Century Association and the National Academy of Design, to which he was elected in 1869. Exhibitions included the following venues: National Academy of Design, 1865–1892; Brooklyn Art Association, 1867–1892; Boston Art Club, 1877–1882; Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, 1879–1881; Art Institute of Chicago; and Metropolitan Museum of Art. Public collections that own or display Wyant's work include the National Museum of American Art, Brooklyn Museum, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Toledo Museum of Art, Tennessee State Museum, Dayton Art Institute, Kentucky Art Museum and Snite Museum of Art.\n\n\n"}

He was defeated by Quantrill's Raiders at the Battle of Baxter Springs in Kansas in 1863, but is considered to have served well as a division commander during Price's Raid in Missouri, which occurred in 1864.\n\nBlunt was born in Trenton, Maine to John Blunt and Sally Gilpatrick Blunt Blunt lived and worked on his family farm until he was 14. He may have spent some time at the Ellsworth Military Academy in Ellsworth, Maine. He became a sailor on a merchant vessel when he was 15, and attained the rank of captain at 20.\n\nIn 1845 Blunt moved to Columbus, Ohio, where he enrolled in Starling Medical College. His maternal uncle, Dr. Rufus Gilpatrick, was one of the instructors. Graduating in February 1849, Blunt moved to New Madison, Ohio and started a practice. On January 15, 1850 he married Nancy G. Putman. Blunt practiced medicine and took an active role in county politics as a member of the Republican Party.\n\nIn 1856 Blunt and his family relocated to Anderson County, Kansas, following his uncle who had moved there several years earlier. He soon became involved in the conflict before the Civil War known as Bleeding Kansas, when abolitionist and slavery forces battled to control the territory. During a confrontation with the pro-slavery territorial government in 1857, Blunt joined a force including Jim Lane and abolitionist John Brown. Blunt was a key member of the Wyandotte constitutional convention that framed the Kansas state constitution in 1859, and served as chair of the committee on militia.\n\nAt the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Blunt was appointed lieutenant colonel of the 3rd Regiment Kansas Volunteer Infantry, a part of James Lane's Kansas Brigade, an irregular partisan force not accepted into the Union Army until reorganized in April 1862. In April 1862, Blunt was appointed brigadier general of volunteers and given command of the Department and Army of Kansas. He ordered Colonel William Weer to lead the \"Indian Expedition\" in 1861 which succeeded in occupying Fort Gibson and arming three regiments of Native Americans. Blunt's forces were defeated in the First Battle of Newtonia, and the Army of Kansas was incorporated into the Army of the Frontier as the 1st Division. Blunt led his division of Cherokee and Kansas volunteers to victory at the Battle of Old Fort Wayne. In December 1862, Blunt's division was joined by the 2nd Division under Francis J. Herron. The combined forces met Confederates under Thomas C. Hindman at the Battle of Prairie Grove. While tactically a draw, the battle was a strategic victory for the Union.\n\nBlunt was appointed major general of volunteers on March 16, 1863. He was the only officer from Kansas to achieve that rank during the war. He established Fort Baxter (also known as Fort Blair) in May 1863 near Baxter Springs, Kansas.\n\nBlunt was appointed to command the District of the Frontier. He campaigned for control of the Indian Territory and won a victory at the Battle of Honey Springs, bringing much of the Indian Territory into Union control. In October 1863, while moving his headquarters from Fort Scott to Fort Smith, Blunt and his detachment were attacked by a Confederate force under William C. Quantrill. At the Battle of Baxter Springs Quantrill's Raiders routed and killed over 80 of Blunt's 100 escorts, including his adjutant Major Henry Curtis, son of Major General Samuel Curtis. These actions led to Blunt's removal from command of the District of the Frontier.\n\nIn 1864, Blunt was able to redeem himself. Confederate Maj. Gen. Sterling Price began an invasion of Missouri and Blunt took command of the 1st Division of Army of the Border. He and the cavalry under Alfred Pleasonton fought delaying actions until Samuel R. Curtis brought the full strength of the army together and inflicted a defeat on Price at the Battle of Westport. Blunt's division inflicted the final defeat to Price at the Second Battle of Newtonia. Blunt commanded the District of South Kansas when the war ended.\n\nAfter the war, Blunt settled with his family in Leavenworth, Kansas and resumed his medical practice; he also was admitted to the Kansas bar as a lawyer. He moved to Washington, D.C. in 1869 where he practiced his new profession.\n\nIn 1873, Blunt was accused by the Department of Justice of conspiracy to defraud the government and a body of Cherokee Indians in North Carolina. Earlier he had been cited in the 41st Congress's investigation of the Department of Indian Affairs, for charging Western tribes exorbitant (40% to 50%) lobbying fees for payments due them.\n\nBlunt's behaviour became erratic in 1879 when he was 53, and he was committed to an asylum. He died two years later, with the cause of death given as \"softening of the brain.\" His body was returned to Leavenworth and is buried in the Mount Muncie Cemetery.\n\nJames Blunt features briefly in \"Rifles for Watie\", a novel by Harold Keith about a young Union soldier from Kansas fighting the Civil War in Indian Territory and the surrounding states. It includes a description of the Battle of Prairie Grove.\n\n"}

{"id": "2162735", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2162735", "title": "Textile manufacturing", "text": "Textile manufacturing\n\nTextile manufacturing is a major industry. It is based on the conversion of fibre into yarn, yarn into fabric. These are then dyed or printed, fabricated into clothes. Different types of fibres are used to produce yarn. Cotton remains the most important natural fibre, so is treated in depth. There are many variable processes available at the spinning and fabric-forming stages coupled with the complexities of the finishing and colouration processes to the production of a wide range of products.\n\nCotton is the world's most important natural fibre. In the year 2007, the global yield was 25 million tons from 35 million hectares cultivated in more than 50 countries.\n\nThere are six stages:\n\nCotton is grown anywhere with long, hot dry summers with plenty of sunshine and low humidity. Indian cotton, \"Gossypium arboreum\", is finer but the staple is only suitable for hand processing. American cotton, \"Gossypium hirsutum\", produces the longer staple needed for machine production. Planting is from September to mid-November and the crop is harvested between March and June. The cotton bolls are harvested by stripper harvesters and spindle pickers that remove the entire boll from the plant. The cotton boll is the seed pod of the cotton plant; attached to each of the thousands of seeds are fibres about 2.5 cm long. \n\n\n\nScutching refers to the process of cleaning cotton of its seeds and other impurities. The first scutching machine was invented in 1797, but did not come into further mainstream use until after 1808 or 1809, when it was introduced and used in Manchester, England. By 1816, it had become generally adopted. The scutching machine worked by passing the cotton through a pair of rollers, and then striking it with iron or steel bars called beater bars or beaters. The beaters, which turn very quickly, strike the cotton hard and knock the seeds out. This process is done over a series of parallel bars so as to allow the seeds to fall through. At the same time, air is blown across the bars, which carries the cotton into a cotton chamber.\n \n\n\n\n\nThe weaving process uses a loom. The lengthway threads are known as the warp, and the cross way threads are known as the weft. The warp, which must be strong, needs to be presented to loom on a warp beam. The weft passes across the loom in a shuttle, that carries the yarn on a pirn. These pirns are automatically changed by the loom. Thus, the yarn needs to be wrapped onto a beam, and onto pirns before weaving can commence.\n\n\n\n\nWhen a hand loom was located in the home, children helped with the weaving process from an early age. Piecing needs dexterity, and a child can be as productive as an adult. When weaving moves from the home to the mill, children are often allowed to \"help\" their older sisters, and laws have to be made to prevent child labour becoming established.\n\nKnitting by machine is done in two different ways; warp and weft. Weft knitting (as seen in the pictures) is similar in method to hand knitting with stitches all connected to each other horizontally. Various weft machines can be configured to produce textiles from a single spool of yarn or multiple spools depending on the size of the machine cylinder (where the needles are bedded). In a warp knit there are many pieces of yarn and there are vertical chains, zigzagged together by crossing the cotton yarn.\n\nWarp knits do not stretch as much as a weft knit, and it is run-resistant. A weft knit is not run-resistant, but stretches more. This is especially true if spools of spandex are processed from separate spool containers and interwoven through the cylinder with cotton yarn, giving the finished product more flexibility and making it less prone to having a 'baggy' appearance. The average t-shirt is a weft knit.\n\nThe woven cotton fabric in its loom-state not only contains impurities, including warp size, but requires further treatment in order to develop its full textile potential. Furthermore, it may receive considerable added value by applying one or more finishing processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduction of cotton requires arable land.\nIn addition, cotton is farmed intensively and uses large amounts of fertilizer and 25% of the world's insecticides. Native Indian varieties of cotton were rainwater fed, but modern hybrids used for the mills need irrigation, which spreads pests. The 5% of cotton-bearing land in India uses 55% of all pesticides used in India. In United Kingdom some companies design cloths for manufacturers such as Sewport, and Bridge & Stitch.\n\nThe consumption of energy in form of water and electricity is relatively high, especially in processes like washing, de-sizing, bleaching, rinsing, dyeing, printing, coating and finishing. Processing is time consuming. The major portion of water in textile industry is used for wet processing of textile (70 per cent). Approximately 25 per cent of energy in the total textile production like fibre production, spinning, twisting, weaving, knitting, clothing manufacturing etc. is used in dyeing. About 34 per cent of energy is consumed in spinning, 23 per cent in weaving, 38 per cent in chemical wet processing and five per cent in miscellaneous processes. Power dominates consumption pattern in spinning and weaving, while thermal energy is the major factor for chemical wet processing.\n\nCotton acts as a carbon sink as it contains cellulose and this contains 44,44% carbon. However, due to carbon emissions from fertiliser application, use of mechanized tools to harvest the cotton, ... cotton manufacture tends to emit more CO than what it stores in the form of cellulose.\n\nThe growth of cotton is divided into two segments i.e. organic and genetically modified. Cotton crop provides livelihood to millions of people but its production is becoming expensive because of high water consumption, use of expensive pesticides, insecticides and fertiliser. Genetically modified products aim to increase disease resistance and reduce the water required. The organic sector was worth $583 million. Genetically modified cotton, in 2007, occupied 43% of cotton growing areas.\n\nBefore mechanisation, cotton was harvested manually by farmers in India and by African slaves in America. In 2012 Uzbekistan was a major exporter of cotton and uses manual labour during the harvest. Human rights groups claim that health care professionals and children are forced to pick cotton.\n\nFlax is a bast fibre, which means it comes in bundles under the bark of the Linum usitatissimum plant. The plant flowers and is harvested.\nIt is now treated like cotton.\n\nJute is a bast fibre, which comes from the inner bark of the plants of the Corchorus genus. It is retted like flax, sundried and baled. When spinning a small amount of oil must be added to the fibre. It can be bleached and dyed. It was used for sacks and bags but is now used for the backing for carpets. Jute can be blended with other fibres to make composite fabrics and work continues in Bangladesh to refine the processes and extend the range of usage possible. In the 1970s, jute-cotton composite fabrics were known as \"jutton\" fabrics.\n\nHemp is a bast fibre from the inner bark of \"Cannabis sativa\". It is difficult to bleach, and is used for making cord and rope.\n\nThese bast fibres can also be used: kenaf, urena, ramie, nettle.\n\nSisal is the main leaf fibre used; others are: abacá and henequen.\n\nWool comes from domesticated sheep. It forms two products, woolens and worsteds. The sheep has two sorts of wool and it is the inner coat that is used. This can be mixed with wool that has been recovered from rags. Shoddy is the term for recovered wool that is not matted, while mungo comes from felted wool. Extract is recovered chemically from mixed cotton/wool fabrics.\n\nThe fleece is cut in one piece from the sheep. This is then skirted to remove the soiled wool, and baled. It is graded into long wool where the fibres can be up to 15 in, but anything over 2.5 inches is suitable for combing into worsteds. Fibres less than that form short wool and are described as clothing or carding wool.\n\nAt the mill the wool is scoured in a detergent to remove grease (the yolk) and impurities. This is done mechanically in the opening machine. Vegetable matter can be removed chemically using sulphuric acid (carbonising). Washing uses a solution of soap and sodium carbonate. The wool is oiled before carding or combing.\n\nThe processes in silk production are similar to those of cotton but take account that reeled silk is a continuous fibre. The terms used are different.\n\nBoth wool and silk require farmland. Whereas silkworms require mulberry leaves, sheep eat grass, clover, forbs and other pasture plants. Sheep, like all ruminants emit CO2 via their digestive system. Also, their pastures may sometimes be fertilised which further increases emissions.\n\nSynthetic fibres are the result of extensive development by scientists to improve upon the naturally occurring animal and plant fibres. In general, synthetic fibres are created by forcing, or extruding, fibre forming materials through holes (called spinnerets) into the air, thus forming a thread. Before synthetic fibres were developed, cellulose fibres were made from natural cellulose, which comes from plants.\n\nThe first artificial fibre, known as art silk from 1799 onwards, became known as viscose around 1894, and finally rayon in 1924. A similar product known as cellulose acetate was discovered in 1865. Rayon and acetate are both artificial fibres, but not truly synthetic, being made from wood. Although these artificial fibres were discovered in the mid-nineteenth century, successful modern manufacture began much later in the 1930s. Nylon, the first synthetic fibre, made its debut in the United States as a replacement for silk, and was used for parachutes and other military uses. \n\nThe techniques used to process these fibres in yarn are essentially the same as with natural fibres, modifications have to be made as these fibres are of great length, and have no texture such as the scales in cotton and wool that aid meshing.\n\nUnlike natural fibres, produced by plants, animals or insects, synthetic fibres are made from fossil fuels, and thus require no farmland.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2162740", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2162740", "title": "Mary Hamilton", "text": "Mary Hamilton\n\n\"Mary Hamilton\", or \"The Fower Maries\" (\"The Four Marys\"), is a common name for a well-known sixteenth-century ballad from Scotland based on an apparently fictional incident about a lady-in-waiting to a Queen of Scotland. It is Child Ballad 173 and Roud 79.\n\nIn all versions of the song, Mary Hamilton is a personal attendant to the Queen of Scots, but precisely which queen is not specified. She becomes pregnant by the Queen's husband, the King of Scots, which results in the birth of a baby. Mary kills the infant – in some versions by casting it out to sea or drowning, and in others by exposure. The crime is seen and she is convicted. The ballad recounts Mary's thoughts about her life and her impending death in a first-person narrative.\n\nVersions of the ballad have been recorded by a number of artists, including Joan Baez, The Corries, and Angelo Branduardi.\n\nMost versions of the song are set in Edinburgh, but Joan Baez set her version, possibly the best known, in Glasgow, ending with these words:\n\nThis verse suggests Mary Hamilton was one of the famous \"Four Maries\", four girls named Mary who were chosen by the queen mother and regent Mary of Guise to be companion ladies-in-waiting to her daughter, the child monarch Mary, Queen of Scots. However their names were Mary Seton, Mary Beaton, Mary Fleming and Mary Livingston.\n\nMary Stuart could not be a real life source for the ballad in any of its current forms as these are in conflict with the historical record. She and the Four Maries lived in France from 1547 to 1560, where Mary was dauphine and then queen as the wife of King Francis II. Mary later returned home to Scotland (keeping the French spelling of her surname, Stuart). She married her second husband, Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley in July 1565, and he was murdered 20 months later. So there was not much time for Darnley to have got one of the four Maries (or any other mistress) pregnant, and there is no record of him having done so. Also the song refers to \"the highest Stewart of all\" – which between 1542 and 1567 was a \"woman\" not a man. \n\nThe ballad could contain echoes of James IV or James V, who both had several illegitimate children, but none of their mistresses were executed or tried to dispose of a baby.\n\nThe story may have been transferred from a wholly different context. It has been noted that it most closely matches, rather than any event in Scotland, the legend of Maria Danilova Gamentova, daughter of an expatriate branch of the Clan Hamilton established in Russia by Thomas Hamilton during the reign of Tsar Ivan IV (1547–1584). A lady in waiting to Tsarina Catherine, second wife of Tsar Peter I \"The Great\" (who later succeeded him as Catherine I), Mary Hamilton was also the Tsar's mistress. She bore a child in 1717, who may have been fathered by the Tsar but whom she admitted drowning shortly after its birth. She also stole trinkets from the Tsarina to present them to her lover Ivan Orlov. For the murder of her child, she was beheaded in 1719.\n\nMary's head was preserved and displayed in the Kunstkamera, a palace holding natural and scientific \"curiosities\". At that time, Charles Wogan was in Russia on a mission for James Francis Edward Stuart, and through him news of the incident might have reached Scotland.\n\nIn many versions of the song, the queen is called \"the auld Queen\". This would normally indicate a Queen Dowager or Queen Mother, but in \"this\" context suggests a queen consort who was an older woman, and married to a king of comparable age. If the reference is limited to Queens named Mary, another candidate would be Mary of Guelders (1434–1463), queen to James II, King of Scots.\n\nThe ballad was catalogued by Francis James Child as Child Ballad # 173.\n\nIn her highly influential text \"A Room of One's Own\", author Virginia Woolf alludes to the characters in the ballad. She refers by name to Mary Beton, Mary Seton, and Mary Carmichael as recurrent personae, leaving only Mary Hamilton, the narrator of the ballad, unmentioned. Mary Beton plays the prominent role in Woolf's extended essay, as she serves as the speaker.\n\nAccording to her narrator in \"A Room of One's Own\", \"'I' is only a convenient term for somebody who has no real being.\" A few sentences later, the narrator returns to the concept of identity and subjectivity and invokes the subjects of the ballad for the first time: \"Here then was I (call me Mary Beton, Mary Seton, Mary Carmichael or by any name you please – it is not a matter of importance)...\"\n\nMary Beton serves as the narrator throughout \"A Room of One's Own\". The six chapters of the essay follow Mary Beton's walks through Oxbridge grounds and London streets, and her mental explorations of the history of women and fiction. The name reappears in the character of the narrator's aunt, who serves as both the namesake and benefactor of Mary Beton. Woolf is able to detach herself from the narrative voice of the essay through the use of Beton.\n\nMary Seton is a friend of Mary Beton at the fictitious Fernham College (modelled after Cambridge's Newnham and Girton Colleges). It is partially through her conversations with Seton that Beton raises questions about the relationship between financial wealth and the opportunities for female education. Speaking of Mary Seton's mother, the narrator states, \"If she had left two or three hundred thousand pounds to Fernham, we could have been sitting at our ease tonight and the subject of our talk might have been archaeology, botany, anthropology, physics, the nature of the atom, mathematics, astronomy, relativity, geography.\"\n\nMary Carmichael plays the role of a fictitious author referenced by the narrator in \"A Room of One's Own\". Her fabricated novel, \"Life's Adventure\", allows Woolf to introduce the concept of female relationships. Mary Carmichael may also evoke the idea of the real author and birth-control activist Marie Carmichael (pseudonym for Marie Stopes) and her novel \"Love's Creation\".\n\nYest're'en the Queen had fower Maries<br>\nThe nicht she'll hae but three<br>\nThere was Mary Seton and Mary Beaton,<br>\nAnd Mary Car-Michael and me.\n\nOh little did my mother think<br>\nThe day she cradled me<br>\nThe lands I was to travel in<br>\nThe death I was tae die\n\nOh tie a napkin roon my eyen<br>\nNo let me seen to die<br>\nAnd sent me a'wa tae my dear mother<br>\nWho's far away o'er the sea\n\nBut I wish I could lie in our ain kirkyard<br>\nBeneath yon old oak tree<br>\nWhere we pulled the rowans and strung the gowans<br>\nMy brothers and sisters and me\n\nYest're'en the Queen had fower Maries<br>\nThe nicht she'll hae but three<br>\nThere was Mary Seton and Mary Beaton,<br>\nAnd Mary Car-Michael and me.\n\nBut why should I fear a nameless grave<br>\nWhen I've hopes for eternity<br>\nAnd I'll pray that the faith o' a dying thief<br>\nBe given through grace tae me\n\nYest're'en the Queen had fower Maries<br>\nThe nicht she'll hae but three<br>\nThere was Mary Seton and Mary Beaton,<br>\nAnd Mary Car-Michael and me.\n\nThere was Mary Seton and Mary Beaton,<br>\nAnd Mary Car-Michael and me.\n\n"}
{"id": "2162751", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2162751", "title": "Open method of coordination", "text": "Open method of coordination\n\nThe open method of coordination (OMC) is a relatively new intergovernmental means of governance in the European Union, based on the voluntary cooperation of its member states. The open method rests on soft law mechanisms such as guidelines and indicators, benchmarking and sharing of best practice. This means that there are no official sanctions for laggards. Rather, the method's effectiveness relies on a form of peer pressure and naming and shaming, as no member state wants to be seen as the worst in a given policy area.\n\nThe OMC works in stages. Firstly, the Council of Ministers agrees on (often very broad) policy goals. Secondly, Member states then transpose guidelines into national and regional policies. Thirdly, specific benchmarks and indicators to measure best practice are agreed upon. Finally, results are monitored and evaluated. However, the OMC differs significantly across the various policy areas to which it has been applied: there may be shorter or longer reporting periods, guidelines may be set at EU or member state level and enforcement mechanisms may be harder or softer.\n\nThe OMC is more intergovernmental in nature than the traditional means of policy-making in the EU, the so-called community method. Because it is a decentralised approach through which agreed policies are largely implemented by the member states and supervised by the Council of the European Union, the involvement of the European Parliament and the European Court of Justice is very weak indeed. Formally, at least, the European Commission has primarily a monitoring role; in practice, however, there is considerable scope for it to help set the policy agenda and persuade reluctant Member States to implement agreed policies. Although the OMC was devised as a tool in policy areas which remain the responsibility of national governments (and where the EU itself has no, or few, legislative powers) it is sometimes seen as a way for the Commission to \"get a foot in the door\" of a national policy area.\n\nThe OMC was first applied in EU employment policy, as defined in the Amsterdam Treaty of 1997, although it was not called by this name at the time. It was officially named, defined and endorsed at the Lisbon Council for the realm of social policy. Since then it has been applied in the European employment strategy, social inclusion, pensions, consumer care, immigration, asylum, education and culture and research, and its use has also been suggested for health as well as environmental affairs. The OMC was also frequently debated in the European Convention.\n\nHistorically, the OMC can be seen as a reaction to the EU's economic integration in the 1990s. This process reduced the member states' options in the field of employment policy. But they were also weary of delegating more powers to the European institutions and thus designed the OMC as an alternative to the existing EU modes of governance.\n\nIn the following, the OMCs in the areas of employment and social protection will be analysed because they are usually considered the most developed ones. A brief introduction to the \"upcoming\" OMC in health is also given. However, bear in mind that the open method seems to become more and more widespread, including areas such as immigration and asylum which are not discussed here.\n\nEMU and in particular the Stability and Growth Pact as well as the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines (which were introduced as an instrument to realise the goals set down in the Lisbon Agenda) can be considered a sort of “proto-OMC” with comparatively hard sanctioning mechanisms. As a reaction to the economic integration of Europe, the European Employment strategy (EES) evolved in the 1990s with the rationale of rebalancing monetary and economic integration. The original EES thus consisted in more or less replicating the EMU process with mid-term objectives, indicators and pressure for convergence. Legitimised through the Amsterdam treaty, the EES then became a process in its own right. As mentioned above, its principles were generalized and christened “Open Method of Coordination” at the Lisbon Summit (2000). Finally, the third phase of the EES began with the five year review in 2003 where the EES was repoliticised, due to the growing dominance of right wing governments in the EU. Nowadays the EES is a political compromise aimed to exclude both pure neo-liberal and social democratic approaches.\n\nThe social inclusion OMC, by contrast, was not directly linked to the EMU debate. Social inclusion was for many years a controversial topic to address at the European level due to the subsidiarity concept. In 1999 the Commission finally adopted a communication for a concerted strategy on social protection, proposing a Social Protection Committee which was made official in the Nice Treaty. Said committee was responsible for the initial standard setting exercise. Next, each member state was asked to benchmark its situation by producing a two year national action plan (NAP or NAPincl), presenting national-level strategies for improving the situation. These were made available in June 2001. 18 months later the EU released a joint report on social inclusion where the member state’s approaches were compared and contrasted and recommendations were given. While the NAPs form a first level of action, the Community Action Programme to combat poverty and social exclusion, which aims to improve cooperation between the member states, can be considered the second level of action.\n\nIn the social inclusion OMC some funds were made available for NGOs and consequently its \"inclusive\" approach to civil society has been favourably commented upon. However, this is not necessarily the case for other OMCs. According to FEANTSA (2005), the Pensions OMC is more closed and involves mainly the Commission and national civil servants.\n\nWhen comparing the EES and social inclusion OMC, Pochet (2005: 43) notes that the first seems to go more in a direction of centralization, naming and shaming without any broad discussion about the content on the European level (top-down). The second process goes more towards an experimental dynamic with the involvement of local and regional actors (bottom-up). However, the author also notes that this is probably an over-generalization with tensions between centralization and decentralization being present in both forms.\n\nDue to their different nature the impact of those two OMCs can be quite diverse as well. Ferrera and Sacchi (2004) analyse the impact of the EES and the Social Inclusion OMC in Italy. They conclude that the autonomous impact of the OMC has been relatively significant in the case of employment and relatively insignificant in the case of social inclusion. One key difference was the treaty status of the employment OMC which forced the Italian authorities to comply - this component was lacking for social inclusion. Furthermore, the issue of unemployment and labour market reform was simply more salient than social inclusion.\n\nAs member states increasingly face common concerns in healthcare (such as demographic ageing), the application of the OMC has been discussed. In March 2004 the European Parliament passed a resolution calling on the Commission to present a proposal for the use of the OMC in health and long term care. The April 2004 Communication by the Commission recommended to apply the OMC to the development and modernization of health care provision and funding. As potential advantages the Commission pointed to:\n\n\nFurther steps have been taken to start the introduction of the OMC.\n\nThe choice of indicators is of vital consequence for the OMC and critics have argued that, for instance in the Social Protection OMC, the quality of the indicators is not high enough or oriented too much on economic criteria and not social ones. Also, for health the comparability of national data has been doubted.\n\nIn the social protection field the Commission is preparing to streamline the methods used in the different OMCs (social inclusion, pensions etc.). In this context, critics fear that the number of indicators will be too much reduced.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2162759", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2162759", "title": "Truth in sentencing", "text": "Truth in sentencing\n\nTruth in sentencing (TIS) is a collection of different but related public policy stances on sentencing of those convicted of crimes in the justice system. In most contexts, it refers to policies and legislation that aim to abolish or curb parole so that convicts serve the period to which they have been sentenced. Truth in sentencing advocates relate such policies in terms of the public's right to know; they argue, for example, that it is deceptive to sentence an individual to \"seven to nine years\" and then release the individual after he or she has served only six years.\n\nIn some cases, truth in sentencing is linked to other movements such as mandatory sentencing (in which particular crimes yield automatic sentences regardless of the extenuating circumstances) and habitual offender or \"three strikes\" laws in which state law requires the state courts to hand down mandatory and extended periods of incarceration to persons who have been convicted of a criminal offense on multiple occasions.\n\nIn Canada, the Truth in Sentencing act, or Bill C-25 came into effect on Monday, February 22, 2010. This bill amends s.719 of the \"Criminal Code of Canada\", limiting the discretion of a sentencing judges to give credit to individuals who have spent time incarcerated prior to conviction. Until then, as discussed by Justice Arbour in \" R v. Wust\", credit for pre-sentencing custody was not determined by a 'mathematical formula', but many judges frequently granted a two-for-one credit.\n\nThat is justified by the quantitative and qualitative differences between pre-and post-sentencing incarceration. Most individuals who are incarcerated will not serve the full length of their sentence, and because time spent incarcerated pre-sentence does not count towards remission time, if a lengthy pre-sentence incarceration is credited equally to post-sentencing incarceration, the convicted individual will serve a longer sentence compared to an individual who is given the same sentence without a lengthy period of pre-sentencing incarceration. Arbour also points out that pre-sentence incarceration is typically served in detention, in harsher circumstances than the sentence will ultimately call for and without access to educational, rehabilitative and vocational programs.\n\nBill C-25 creates three changes in the Criminal Code; now under s.719(3), generally the maximum credit a judge can give is 1:1. Under s.719(3.1) and 719(3.2) a judge can give a credit of 1.5:1 only \"if the circumstances justify it.\" Under s.719(3.1), the sentencing judge cannot give greater than 1:1 credit if the reason for pre-sentencing incarceration is either that person's criminal record or if that individual has breached bail conditions.\n\nThe constitutionality of this bill was challenged under s.7, s.13 and s.15 of \" The Charter\" in the Ontario Court of Justice by Marvin Johnson. The court found that the amendment survivor \"Charter\" scrutiny if the phrase \"if the circumstances justify it\" is interpreted in a manner that does not limit the granting of a 1.5:1 credit to such a high standard \"that mandates a level of exceptionality that goes well beyond the ordinary experience of \"dead time\" or the penal disparities that typically flow from such pre-sentence custody.\" In this case, Johnson who was sentenced to 18 months for the sale of $20 of cocaine to an undercover officer, was given a 1.5:1 credit for the 12 months that he had spent in pre-sentence custody and was released two days after his sentencing hearing to a one year period of probation.\n\nThe first law requiring truth in sentencing in the United States was passed by Washington State in 1984. In 1994, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act created the Violent Offender Incarceration and Truth in Sentencing program, which awarded grants to states so long as they passed laws requiring that offenders convicted of Part 1 violent crimes must serve at least 85% of the sentence for qualifying crimes before becoming eligible for parole. As of 2008, the District of Columbia and 35 of the 50 states qualify for this additional funding.\n\nIn New South Wales, \"truth in sentencing\" was brought in with the '1989 Sentencing Act'. According to \"The Sydney Morning Herald\", since the enactment of the legislation, life imprisonment \"has meant life\". The term \"truth in sentencing\", which was commonly used to refer to the legislation, was endorsed by the Australian Law Reform Commission.\n\nThe first murderer to be sentenced under the legislation was Matthew Webster, who was convicted of the murder of Leigh Leigh. In 1990 Webster received 14 years with an additional six-year parole period; he remained in prison for 14½ years. If he had received a 'life sentence' under the previous legislation, it is likely that he would have only served nine years due to his age.\n\n"}

Desirous of a more worldly career, he entered the service of Prince-Bishop Cuthbert Tunstall, then Bishop of London. Having helped to draw up the \"Institution of a Christian Man\", Wotton in 1539 went to arrange the marriage between Henry VIII and Anne of Cleves and the union of Protestant princes which was to be the complement of this union. Wotton crossed over to England with the new royal bride but, unlike Thomas Cromwell, he did not lose the royal favour when the king repudiated Anne.\n\nIn 1541, having already refused the bishopric of Hereford, he became the first post-Reformation dean of Canterbury and in 1544 dean of York. In 1543 he went on diplomatic business to the Netherlands, and for the next year or two he had much intercourse with the Emperor Charles V He helped to conclude the Treaty of Ardres between England and France in 1546, and was Ambassador resident in France from 1546 to 1549. Henry VIII made Wotton an executor of his Will and left him £300, and in October 1549, under Edward VI the post of Minister of State lay vacant; he held the post for about a year until succeeded by the unimpeachable Protestant Sir William Cecil.\n\nIn 1550 Wotton was again sent as Royal Envoy to the Holy Roman Emperor and as Ambassador to France during the reign of Mary, doing valuable work in that capacity securing the peace. He left France in 1557, but in 1558 he was again in that kingdom, helping to arrange the preliminaries of the Peace of Cateau Cambrésis. In 1560 he signed the Treaty of Edinburgh on behalf of Elizabeth I, and he had again visited the Netherlands before his death in London.\n\nHe is buried in the Trinity Chapel of Canterbury Cathedral.\n\nHis brother Sir Edward Wotton was made Treasurer of Calais in 1540, and was one of those who took part in the overthrow of the Lord Protector Somerset.\n\nHis nephew, Thomas Wotton (1521–1587) was the father of Sir Henry Wotton and of Edward Wotton, 1st Baron Wotton.\n\nHis sister Margaret was the mother of Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, and the grandmother of Lady Jane Grey.\n\n"}

{"id": "2162787", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2162787", "title": "Dinosaucers", "text": "Dinosaucers\n\nDinosaucers is a 1987 animated television series co-produced in the United States and Canada, produced by DIC Animation City and distributed in syndication in the US by Coca-Cola Telecommunications. The show was created by producer Michael E. Uslan, who considered it a \"hairbained idea\". A total of 65 episodes were made for the show's first-run syndication, but it only lasted one season.\n\nThere were originally plans by Galoob to release a Dinosaucers toyline, and prototype figures were produced; however, the line was scrapped after the show was canceled. The toys included Stego, Bronto-Thunder, Allo, Bonehead, Plesio, Quackpot, Ankylo, and Genghis Rex.\n\nIn 2018, Uslan joined with publisher Lion Forge Comics to revive \"Dinosaucers\" as a comic book.\n\nThe show follows the Dinosaucers and their battles against the evil Tyrannos. Each group is composed of intelligent anthropomorphic dinosaurs or other prehistoric saurian species. The Dinosaucers are also allied with four humans known as the Secret Scouts. The two groups originally come from a planet in a counter-Earth orbit known as Reptilon. Most of the characters are named after the type of prehistoric animal they are based on, or some pun of the name.\n\nBoth groups have a central base of operations. The Dinosaucers' base is called Lava Dome and is located in a mountain area, in a dormant volcano. The Tyrannos' base is located under a tar pit. Each of the groups' members save for Teryx and Terrible Dactyl–who can themselves fly–have flying ships in which they can travel and do battle. Most ships actually resemble the personae of their respective owners. Along with their individual ships, both groups have a large mothership of sorts as well.\n\nAll the Dinosaucers have a button on the front of their uniforms which instantly devolves them to their primitive ancestors dinosaur state, while retaining their intelligence and speech capacity. This special ability is called \"Dinovolving\" and initially appeared to be a significant element of the series, as both Allo and Bronto Thunder Dinovolved in the first episode. Despite the apparent technological advantage, most of the later episodes did not feature any Dinovolving. Teryx was the only Dinosaucer who would never Dinovolve throughout the series, while Allo, Tricero, Bonehead and Bronto Thunder would use the ability in more than one episode.\n\nThe Tyrannos don't have the secret of Dinovolving, and a few episodes even revolve around their plans to steal the technology somehow. However, they do possess a special raygun called a \"devolver\". Blasting a living creature with this weapon has the same \"devolving\" effect as Dinovolving, but reduces the victim's intelligence to that of the devolved form. For those from Reptilon the form is that of a normal dinosaur while humans get reverted to primitive cavemen. In any case, the device often winds up being used against them, to much comedic effect, rather than on the Dinosaucers. In this fashion, Genghis Rex, Ankylo, Quackpot and Brachio were all changed into primitive dinosaurs at various times in the series. The Tyrannos also possess a weapon called a \"fossilizer\", which is capable of turning its target into stone, as well as reversing the condition. The Dinosaucers were also shown to have access to this particular type of weapon in one episode, though it may have been on loan from the Tyrannos, as both factions had united to battle a group of anthropomorphic Sabertooth Tigers, who also hailed from Reptilon. These creatures possessed fossilizers as well, and also had a device which could disrupt the equivalent weapons belonging to the Dinosaucers and Tyrannos while leaving their own in perfect working order.\n\n\nThe Secret Scouts are four teenage humans who help the Dinosaucers as allies. According to the opening credits they met them when they first arrived and gained powers through magic rings they were given. They are some of the closest friends the Dinosaucers have while they are on Earth.\n\nThe Tyrannos are the forces of \"evil\" in the series and, like the Dinosaucers, have a total of 8 members in their group. The picture above does not show Princess Dei, as she does not appear at the presentation of the series and is only introduced later as a means to balance the difference in numbers and power of the two opposing factions.\n\nDuring the course of the series, Plesio, Terrible Dactyl and Quackpot would all betray Genghis Rex at least once over matters of conscience. Nevertheless, they would eventually return to Rex's side out of loyalty to his cause.\n\n\n\n\nThere have been four tapes in total released on VHS cassette in NTSC format specifically for the United States and Canadian markets. None are still in print or available, making these 4 VHS tapes rare. Dinosaucers has not been released on DVD and there are no known plans to do so from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.\n\n\nThere were two tapes in total released for the UK market in PAL format. Unlike the United States released tapes that had two episodes on each tape, the United Kingdom tapes had five episodes each on both tapes released, making it superior to the North American VHS tapes, since the UK tapes contains more episodes showing.\nHowever, the first 21 episodes can be purchased and downloaded online on Amazon.com as well as on iTunes.\n\nAll the episodes are directed by Stephan Martinière.\n\n\n\n"}

Gannex raincoats were worn by Prime Minister Harold Wilson, a friend of his. Kagan was sent to prison for ten months in 1980 for tax evasion.\n\nHe was born Juozapas Kaganas into a Litvak family in Lithuania. His parents Benjamin and Miriam Kagan had built up a successful textile business in Kaunas. He first came to England in 1933 to study at the University of Leeds but returned to Lithuania where he was trapped on the outbreak of the Second World War in Kaunas. His father was away when the Soviets invaded in 1940, and escaped bound for Britain, (Benjamin, his father, was the second oldest man in Britain when he died at the age of 109.) Unusually, Kagan was allowed to retain the family's woollen factory leading to (unproven) suspicions he was an agent of the Russian security services.\n\nThe Nazis invaded Lithuania during summer 1941 and Kagan was interned by them. He married Margarita Shtromaite (later Lady Kagan) in the Kaunas Ghetto. The newlyweds and Kagan's mother, Mira managed to survive over three years in this ghetto. First, they were ordinary inmates, but when Kagan realised there was no chance of their surviving unless they escaped, he organised a hiding place for himself, his new wife and his mother in a factory just outside the ghetto walls. The three lived in a small box in the factory attic for nine months, kept alive by the efforts of a Lithuanian non-Jew, Vytautas Rinkevicius, who risked his and his family's life to save them.\n\nWhen the Nazis were ousted from Lithuania, Joseph and Margaret Kagan made their way to Bucharest and from there, to Britain. From 1946 he settled in Huddersfield and began work as a blanket weaver. He founded Kagan Textiles Ltd. at a small factory opposite Elland Town Hall.\n\nIn 1951, Kagan invented Gannex leading to his firm' expansion and its move to a larger mill in Dewsbury Road. After the then opposition trade spokesman, Harold Wilson, wore a Gannex coat on a world tour in 1956, the raincoats became fashion icons, and were worn by world leaders such as Lyndon Johnson, Mao Zedong and Nikita Khrushchev, as well as by Queen Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh. In addition they were worn by Arctic and Antarctic explorers, Himalayan climbers, the armed services and police forces in Britain and Canada. The success of the new fabric made Kagan a multi-millionaire and a series of mergers, takeovers and outright purchases put Kagan Textiles in control of one of the most efficient combines in the textile and clothing industries. In 1967, he bought Barkisland Hall, Barkisland as accommodation for visitors to his company.\n\nHuddersfield was the home town of Harold Wilson, later Leader of the Opposition in 1963, and Kagan became close to Wilson and provided funding for his private office. In Wilson's first resignation honours list in 1970, Kagan was given a knighthood. In 1971, a defecting KGB agent, Oleg Lyalin, relayed accounts of Kagan boasting of his connection to Wilson, leading to MI5 placing him under surveillance, but finding no evidence of spying.\n\nWhen Wilson resigned as Prime Minister in March 1976, Kagan was made a life peer as Baron Kagan, of Elland in the County of West Yorkshire, in the 1976 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours, taking the Labour Party whip.\n\nKagan was later charged with tax evasion, though the formal charges were styled as \"theft\" (of barrels of indigo dye) from his, by then, former company and \"false accounting\", to comply with extradition treaties which did not cover tax offences. After a stay in Tel Aviv, he was arrested in Paris and extradited to Britain. On 12 December 1980, he was convicted of four counts of theft. He was fined £375,000 and served a ten-month sentence, first in Armley, then in Rudgate open prison, Yorkshire. He lost his knighthood, but his peerage could not be forfeited. It was also revealed around this time that Kagan had been friendly with Richardas Vaygauskas, a former official at the Russian embassy, who was known to be a KGB agent. However, Tam Dalyell in his 1995 obituary of Kagan, believed that he had maintained such contacts to assist relatives in Vilnius; Vaygauskas was also from Lithuania.\n\nAfter his release from custody, Kagan returned to the House of Lords and spoke on prison reform. In 1994 his health deteriorated, and he died peacefully in his London apartment the following year.\n\nHis son Daniel Kagan is a Democratic Member of the Colorado House of Representatives.\n"}

{"id": "2162835", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2162835", "title": "Racism in the United States", "text": "Racism in the United States\n\nRacism in the United States has existed since the colonial era, when white Americans were given legally or socially sanctioned privileges and rights while these same rights were denied to other races and minorities. European Americans—particularly affluent white Anglo-Saxon Protestants—enjoyed exclusive privileges in matters of education, immigration, voting rights, citizenship, land acquisition, and criminal procedure throughout American history. Non-Protestant immigrants from Europe, particularly the Irish, Poles, and Italians, often suffered xenophobic exclusion and other forms of ethnicity-based discrimination in American society until the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In addition, groups like Jews and Arabs have faced continuous discrimination in the United States, and as a result, some people who belong to these groups are not identified as white. African Americans faced restrictions on their political, social, and economic freedom throughout much of US history. East, South, and Southeast Asians have also faced racism in America.\n\nMajor racially and ethnically structured institutions and manifestations of racism have included genocide, slavery, segregation, Native American reservations, Native American boarding schools, immigration and naturalization laws, and internment camps. Formal racial discrimination was largely banned by the mid-20th century and over time, it came to be perceived as being socially and morally unacceptable. Racial politics remains a major phenomenon, and racism continues to be reflected in socioeconomic inequality. Racial stratification continues to occur in employment, housing, education, lending, and government.\n\nIn the view of the United Nations and the U.S. Human Rights Network, \"discrimination in the United States permeates all aspects of life and extends to all communities of color.\" While the nature of the views held by average Americans has changed significantly over the past several decades, surveys by organizations such as ABC News have found that even in modern America, large sections of Americans admit to holding discriminatory viewpoints. For example, a 2007 article by ABC stated that about one in ten admitted to holding prejudices against Hispanic and Latino Americans and about one in four did so regarding Arab-Americans. A 2018 YouGov/Economist poll found that 17% of Americans oppose interracial marriage, with 19% of members of \"other\" ethnic groups, 18% of blacks, 17% of whites, and 15% of Hispanics opposing it.\n\nSome Americans saw the presidential candidacy of Barack Obama, who served as president of the United States from 2009 to 2017 and was the nation's first black president, as a sign that the nation had entered a new, post-racial era. The right-wing populist radio and television host Lou Dobbs claimed in November 2009, \"We are now in a 21st-century post-partisan, post-racial society.\" Two months later, Chris Matthews, an MSNBC host, said that President Obama, \"is post-racial by all appearances. You know, I forgot he was black tonight for an hour.\" The election of President Donald Trump in 2016 has been viewed by some commentators as a racist backlash against the election of Barack Obama, with CNN commentator Van Jones calling his election a \"whitelash\".\n\nDuring the 2010s, American society has continued to experience high levels of racism and discrimination. One new phenomenon has been the rise of the \"alt-right\" movement: a white nationalist coalition that seeks the expulsion of sexual and racial minorities from the United States. In August 2017, these groups attended a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, intended to unify various white nationalist factions. During the rally, a white supremacist demonstrator drove his car into a group of counter-protesters, killing one person and injuring 19. Since the mid-2010s, the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have considered white supremacist violence to be the leading threat of domestic terrorism in the United States.\n\nRacism is a systematized form of oppression by one race against another. Prejudicial attitudes existed between races for thousands of years, but systematized racial oppression first arose in the 1600s. Before this, slaves in various cultures were taken without racism as the basis – slaves were usually taken as a result of military conquest. But when European traders found that their superior technology in sailing ships and firearms gave them a tremendous advantage in Africa, they began plundering Africa's wealth and taking slaves. Slavers and slave owners tried to convince themselves that their African slaves had no previous culture, that they had been living as savages, which was false. White European Americans involved in the slave industry tried to justify their economic exploitation of black people by creating a \"scientific\" theory of white superiority and black inferiority. One such slave owner was Thomas Jefferson, and it was his call for science to determine the obvious \"inferiority\" of blacks that is regarded as \"an extremely important stage in the evolution of scientific racism.\" This was the start of systematized racism in the United States.\n\nThe Atlantic slave trade had an economic foundation. The dominant ideology among the European elite who structured national policy throughout the age of the Atlantic slave trade was mercantilism, the belief that national policy should be centered around amassing military power and economic wealth. Colonies were sources of mineral wealth and crops, to be used to the colonizing country's advantage. Using Europeans for labor in the colonies proved unsustainably expensive, as well as harmful to the domestic labor supply of the colonizing countries. Instead, the colonies imported African slaves, who were \"available in large numbers at prices that made plantation agriculture in the Americas profitable\".\n\nIt is also argued that along with the economic motives underlying slavery in the Americas, European world schemas played a large role in the enslavement of Africans. According to this view, the European in-group for humane behavior included the sub-continent, while African and American Indian cultures had a more localized definition of \"an insider\". While neither schema has inherent superiority, the technological advantage of Europeans became a resource to disseminate the conviction that underscored their schemas, that non-Europeans could be enslaved. With the capability to spread their schematic representation of the world, Europeans could impose a social contract, morally permitting three centuries of African slavery. While the disintegration of this social contract by the eighteenth century led to abolitionism, it is argued that the removal of barriers to \"insider status\" is a very slow process, uncompleted even today (2017).\n\nAs a result of the above, the Atlantic slave trade prospered. According to estimates in the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database, between 1626 and 1860 more than 470,000 slaves were forcibly transported from Africa to what is now the United States. Prior to the Civil War, eight serving presidents owned slaves, a practice protected by the U.S. Constitution. Providing wealth for the white elite, approximately one in four Southern families held slaves prior to the Civil War. According to the 1860 U.S. census, there were about 385,000 slave owners out of a white population in the slave states of approximately 7 million.\n\nGroups of armed white men, called slave patrols, monitored enslaved African Americans. First established in South Carolina in 1704, the slave patrols' function was to police slaves, especially runaways. Slave owners feared slaves might organize a revolt or rebellion, so state militias were formed to provide a military command structure and discipline within the slave patrols to detect, encounter, and crush any organized slave meetings that might lead to revolt or rebellion.\n\nDuring the 1820s and 1830s, the American Colonization Society (A.C.S.) was had as its mission assisting free black Americans to where they could supposedly enjoy greater freedom in Africa, In 1821 the A.C.S. established the colony of Liberia, assisting thousands of former African-American slaves and free black people (with legislated limits) to move there from the United States. Some slaves were manumitted (set free) on condition that they emigrate. The slave states made no secret that they wanted to get rid of free blacks, whom they believe threatened their investment, the slaves, encouraging escapes and revolts. The support for the ACS was primarily Southern. The founder of the ACS, Henry Clay of Kentucky, stated that because of \"unconquerable prejudice resulting from their color, they never could amalgamate with the free whites of this country. It was desirable, therefore, as it respected them, and the residue of the population of the country, to drain them off\".\nAlthough in 1820 the Atlantic slave trade was equated with piracy, punishable by death, the practice of chattel slavery continued to exist in the United States for another 35 years. The domestic slave trade \"exporting\" slaves south from Maryland and Virginia, which had surplusses; see Franklin and Armfield Office was a major economic activity in the U.S. which lasted until the 1860s. Enslaved family members would be split up never to see or hear of each other again. Between 1830 and 1840 nearly 250,000 slaves were taken across state lines. In the 1850s more than 193,000 were transported, and historians estimate nearly one million in total were forced to migrate.\n\nThe historian Ira Berlin called this forced migration of slaves the \"Second Middle Passage\", because it reproduced many of the same horrors as the Middle Passage (the name given to the transportation of slaves from Africa to North America). These sales of slaves broke up many families, with Berlin writing that whether slaves were directly uprooted or lived in fear that they or their families would be involuntarily moved, \"the massive deportation traumatized black people\". Individuals lost their connection to families and clans. Added to the earlier colonists combining slaves from different tribes, many ethnic Africans lost their knowledge of varying tribal origins in Africa. Most were descended from families who had been in the U.S. for many generations.\n\nEffective January 1, 1863, President Lincoln stated in his Emancipation Proclamation: \"That on the first day of January in the year of our Lord, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, all persons held as slaves within any State, or designated part of a State, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free; and the executive government of the United States, including the military and naval authority thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons, and will do no act or acts to repress such persons, or any of them, in any efforts they may make for their actual freedom.\"\n\nThe Proclamation marked a monumental change in the federal government's position on slavery: the federal government had never taken even a limited pro-emancipation stance (and that it did at that time was possible because of the 1861 departure of almost all of the Southern members of Congress). Yet it was of more limited application than at first appears. It exempted the border states of Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, and the new state of West Virginia, and also those limited portions of some states, such as Virginia, loyal to the Union; in those states slavery remained legal until ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment in December of 1865. Lincoln believed that the federal government did not have the authority to prohibit slavery; that would violate states' rights. (He did end slavery in the District of Columbia.) But he was also Commander of the Armed Forces. An action against states in rebellion, a step towards their defeat, was entirely appropriate. The South took it as a hostile act. This allowed Lincoln to prohibit slavery to a limited extent, without resistance from anti-abolitionist forces in the Union. No slaves outside of border areas were immediately affected, and it was the invading Northern armies who carried the enforcement of the prohibition with them.\n\nWhile personally opposed to slavery (see Abraham Lincoln and slavery), Lincoln believed that the Constitution did not give Congress the power to end it, stating in his first Inaugural Address that he \"had no objection to [this] being made express and irrevocable\" via the Corwin Amendment. On social and political rights for blacks, Lincoln stated, \"I am not, nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people, I as much as any man am in favor of the superior position assigned to the white race.\" The Emancipation Proclamation did not apply to areas loyal to, or controlled by, the Union. Slavery was not actually abolished in the U.S. until the passage of the 13th Amendment which was declared ratified on December 6, 1865.\n\nAbout four million black slaves were freed in 1865. Ninety-five percent of blacks lived in the South, comprising one third of the population there as opposed to one percent of the population of the North. Consequently, fears of eventual emancipation were much greater in the South than in the North. Based on 1860 census figures, 8% of males aged 13 to 43 died in the civil war, including 6% in the North and 18% in the South.\n\nAfter the Civil War, the 13th amendment in 1865, formally abolishing slavery, was ratified. Furthermore, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which broadened a range of civil rights to all persons born in the United States. Despite this, the emergence of \"Black Codes\", sanctioned acts of subjugation against blacks, continued to bar African-Americans from due civil rights. The Naturalization Act of 1790 limited U.S. citizenship to whites only, and in 1868 the effort toward civil rights was underscored with the 14th amendment which granted citizenship to blacks. The Civil Rights Act of 1875 followed, which was eliminated in a decision that undermined federal power to thwart private racial discrimination. Nonetheless, the last of the Reconstruction Era amendments, the 15th amendment promised voting rights to African-American men (previously only white men of property could vote), and these cumulative federal efforts, African-Americans began taking advantage of enfranchisement. African-Americans began voting, seeking office positions, utilizing public education.\n\nBy the end of Reconstruction in the mid 1870s, violent white supremacists came to power via paramilitary groups such as the Red Shirts and the White League and imposed Jim Crow laws that deprived African-Americans of voting rights and instituted systemic discriminatory policies through policies of unequal racial segregation. Segregation, which began with slavery, continued with Jim Crow laws, with signs used to show blacks where they could legally walk, talk, drink, rest, or eat. For those places that were racially mixed, non-whites had to wait until all white customers were dealt with. Segregated facilities extended from white only schools to white only graveyards.\n\nNative Americans have lived on the North American continent for at least 10,000 years and millions of Native Americans were living in what is today the United States at the time European settlers first arrived. During the colonial and independent periods, European settlers waged a long series of conflicts, often with the objective of obtaining the resources of Native Americans. Through wars, forced displacement (such as the Trail of Tears), and the imposition of treaties, land was taken. The loss of land often resulted in hardships for Native Americans. In the early 18th century, the English had enslaved nearly 800 Choctaws.\n\nAfter the creation of the United States, the idea of Indian removal gained momentum. However, some Native Americans chose or were allowed to remain and avoided removal whereafter they were subjected to official racism. The Choctaws in Mississippi described their situation in 1849, \"we have had our habitations torn down and burned, our fences destroyed, cattle turned into our fields and we ourselves have been scourged, manacled, fettered and otherwise personally abused, until by such treatment some of our best men have died.\" Joseph B. Cobb, who moved to Mississippi from Georgia, described the Choctaws as having \"no nobility or virtue at all,\" and in some respect he found blacks, especially native Africans, to be more interesting and admirable, the red man's superior in every way. The Choctaw and Chickasaw, the tribes he knew best, were beneath contempt, that is, even worse than black slaves.\nIn the 1800s, ideologies such as Manifest destiny, which held the view that the United States was destined to expand from coast to coast on the North American continent, fueled U.S. attacks against, and maltreatment of, Native Americans. In the years leading up to the Indian Removal Act of 1830 there were many armed conflicts between settlers and Native Americans. A justification for the conquest and subjugation of indigenous people emanated from the stereotyped perception that Native Americans were \"merciless Indian savages\" (as described in the United States Declaration of Independence). Sam Wolfson in \"The Guardian\" writes, \"The declaration’s passage has often been cited as an encapsulation of the dehumanizing attitude toward indigenous Americans that the US was founded on.\" Simon Moya-Smith, culture editor at \"Indian Country Today\", states, \"Any holiday that would refer to my people in such a repugnant, racist manner is certainly not worth celebrating. [July Fourth] is a day when we celebrate our resiliency, our culture, our languages, our children and we mourn the millions – literally millions – of indigenous people who have died as a consequence of American imperialism.\"\n\nIn 1861, residents of Mankato, Minnesota, formed the Knights of the Forest, with the goal of 'eliminating all Indians from Minnesota.' An egregious attempt occurred with the California gold rush, the first two years of which saw the death of thousands of Native Americans. Under Mexican rule in California, Indians were subjected to \"de facto\" enslavement under a system of peonage by the white elite. While in 1850, California formally entered the Union as a free state, with respect to the issue of slavery, the practice of Indian indentured servitude was not outlawed by the California Legislature until 1863. The 1864 deportation of the Navajos by the U.S. government occurred when 8,000 Navajos were forcibly relocated to an internment camp in Bosque Redondo, where, under armed guards, more than 3,500 Navajo and Mescalero Apache men, women, and children died from starvation and disease.\nNative American nations on the plains in the west continued armed conflicts with the U.S. throughout the 19th century, through what were called generally Indian Wars. Notable conflicts in this period include the Dakota War, Great Sioux War, Snake War and Colorado War. In the years leading up to the Wounded Knee massacre the U.S. government had continued to seize Lakota lands. A Ghost Dance ritual on the Northern Lakota reservation at Wounded Knee, South Dakota, led to the U.S. Army's attempt to subdue the Lakota. The dance was part of a religion founded by Wovoka that told of the return of the Messiah to relieve the suffering of Native Americans and promised that if they would live righteous lives and perform the Ghost Dance properly, the European American invaders would vanish, the bison would return, and the living and the dead would be reunited in an Edenic world. On December 29, 1890, at Wounded Knee, gunfire erupted, and U.S. soldiers killed up to 300 Indians, mostly old men, women and children.\n\nDuring the period surrounding the 1890 Wounded Knee Massacre, author L. Frank Baum wrote two editorials about Native Americans. Five days after the killing of the Lakota Sioux holy man, Sitting Bull, Baum wrote, \"The proud spirit of the original owners of these vast prairies inherited through centuries of fierce and bloody wars for their possession, lingered last in the bosom of Sitting Bull. With his fall the nobility of the Redskin is extinguished, and what few are left are a pack of whining curs who lick the hand that smites them. The Whites, by the law of conquest, by a justice of civilization, are masters of the American continent, and the best safety of the frontier settlements will be secured by the total annihilation of the few remaining Indians. Why not annihilation? Their glory has fled, their spirit broken, their manhood effaced; better that they die than live the miserable wretches that they are.\" Following the December 29, 1890, massacre, Baum wrote, \"The \"Pioneer\" has before declared that our only safety depends upon the total extermination [sic] of the Indians. Having wronged them for centuries we had better, in order to protect our civilization, follow it up by one more wrong and wipe these untamed and untamable creatures from the face of the earth. In this lies safety for our settlers and the soldiers who are under incompetent commands. Otherwise, we may expect future years to be as full of trouble with the redskins as those have been in the past.\"\n\nMilitary and civil resistance by Native Americans has been a constant feature of American history. So too have a variety of debates around issues of sovereignty, the upholding of treaty provisions, and the civil rights of Native Americans under U.S. law.\n\nOnce their territories were incorporated into the United States, surviving Native Americans were denied equality before the law and often treated as wards of the state.\n\nMany Native Americans were moved to reservations—constituting 4% of U.S. territory. In a number of cases, treaties signed with Native Americans were violated. Tens of thousands of American Indians and Alaska Natives were forced to attend a residential school system which sought to reeducate them in white settler American values, culture and economy.\n\nThe treatment of the Native Americans was admired by the Nazis. Nazi expansion eastward was accompanied with invocation of America's colonial expansion westward under the banner of Manifest Destiny, with the accompanying wars on the Native Americans. In 1928, Hitler praised Americans for having \"gunned down the millions of Redskins to a few hundred thousand, and now kept the modest remnant under observation in a cage\" in the course of founding their continental empire. On Nazi Germany's expansion eastward, Hitler stated, \"Our Mississippi [the line beyond which Thomas Jefferson wanted all Indians expelled] must be the Volga, and not the Niger.\"\n\nFurther dispossession of various kinds continues into the present, although these current dispossessions, especially in terms of land, rarely make major news headlines in the country (e.g., the Lenape people's recent fiscal troubles and subsequent land grab by the State of New Jersey), and sometimes even fail to make it to headlines in the localities in which they occur. Through concessions for industries such as oil, mining and timber and through division of land from the Allotment Act forward, these concessions have raised problems of consent, exploitation of low royalty rates, environmental injustice, and gross mismanagement of funds held in trust, resulting in the loss of $10–40 billion.\n\nThe Worldwatch Institute notes that 317 reservations are threatened by environmental hazards, while Western Shoshone land has been subjected to more than 1,000 nuclear explosions.\n\nThe government appointed agents, like Benjamin Hawkins, to live among the Native Americans and to teach them, through example and instruction, how to live like whites. America's first president, George Washington, formulated a policy to encourage the \"civilizing\" process.\n\nThe Naturalization Act of 1790 limited citizenship to whites only. The Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 granted U.S. citizenship to all Native Americans. Prior to the passage of the act, nearly two-thirds of Native Americans were already U.S. citizens. The earliest recorded date of Native Americans becoming U.S. citizens was in 1831 when the Mississippi Choctaw became citizens after the United States Legislature ratified the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek. Under article XIV of that treaty, any Choctaw who elected not to move to Native American Territory could become an American citizen when he registered and if he stayed on designated lands for five years after treaty ratification.\n\nWhile formal equality has been legally recognized, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders remain among the most economically disadvantaged groups in the country, and according to National mental health studies, American Indians as a group tend to suffer from high levels of alcoholism, depression and suicide.\n\nThe 1879 Constitution of the State of California prohibited the employment of Chinese people by state and local governments, as well as by businesses that were incorporated in California. Also, the 1879 California constitution delegated power to local governments of California to remove Chinese people from within their borders. The Chinese Exclusion Act banning immigration of Chinese laborers was enacted on the national level in 1882. Several massacres of Chinese people, including the Rock Springs massacre of 1885 and the Hells Canyon massacre of 1887 further exemplified deep American racist animus against Chinese people.\n\nThe new century saw a hardening of institutionalized racism and legal discrimination against citizens of African descent in the United States. Throughout this post Civil War period, racial stratification was informally and systemically enforced, in order to solidify the pre-existing social order. Although technically able to vote, poll taxes, pervasive acts of terror such as lynching in the United States (often perpetrated by groups such as the reborn Ku Klux Klan, founded in the Reconstruction South), and discriminatory laws such as grandfather clauses kept black Americans (and many Poor Whites) disenfranchised particularly in the South. Furthermore, discrimination extended to state legislation that \"allocated vastly unequal financial support\" for black and white schools. In addition to this, county officials sometimes redistributed resources earmarked for blacks to white schools, further undermining educational opportunities. In response to de jure racism, protest and lobbyist groups emerged, most notably, the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) in 1909.\n\nThis time period is sometimes referred to as the nadir of American race relations because racism, segregation, racial discrimination, and expressions of white supremacy all increased. So did anti-black violence, including race riots such as the Atlanta Race riot of 1906 and the Tulsa race riot of 1921. The Atlanta riot was characterized by the French newspaper \"Le Petit Journal\" as a \"racial massacre of negroes\". The Charleston \"News and Courier\" wrote in response to the Atlanta riots: \"Separation of the races is the only radical solution of the negro problem in this country. There is nothing new about it. It was the Almighty who established the bounds of the habitation of the races. The negroes were brought here by compulsion; they should be induced to leave here by persuasion.\"\n\nIn addition, racism, which had been viewed primarily as a problem in the Southern states, burst onto the national consciousness following the Great Migration, the relocation of millions of African Americans from their roots in the rural Southern states to the industrial centers of the North and West between 1910 and 1970, particularly in cities such as Boston, Chicago, Detroit, New York City (Harlem), Los Angeles, Oakland, Seattle, Portland, Phoenix, and Denver. Within Chicago, for example, between 1910 and 1970, the percentage of African-Americans leapt from 2.0 percent to 32.7 percent. The demographic patterns of black migrants and external economic conditions are largely studied stimulants regarding the Great Migration. For example, migrating blacks (between 1910 and 1920) were more likely to be literate than blacks that remained in the South. Known economic push factors played a role in migration, such as the emergence of a split labor market and agricultural distress from the boll weevil destruction of the cotton economy.\nSouthern migrants were often treated in accordance with pre-existing racial stratification. The rapid influx of blacks into the North and West disturbed the racial balance within cities, exacerbating hostility between both black and white residents in the two regions. Stereotypic schemas of Southern blacks were used to attribute issues in urban areas, such as crime and disease, to the presence of African-Americans. Overall, African-Americans in most Northern and Western cities experienced systemic discrimination in a plethora of aspects of life. Within employment, economic opportunities for blacks were routed to the lowest-status and restrictive in potential mobility. Within the housing market, stronger discriminatory measures were used in correlation to the influx, resulting in a mix of \"targeted violence, restrictive covenants, redlining and racial steering\".\n\nThroughout this period, racial tensions exploded, most violently in Chicago, and lynchings—mob-directed hangings, usually racially motivated—increased dramatically in the 1920s. Urban riots—whites attacking blacks—became a northern and western problem. Many whites defended their space with violence, intimidation, or legal tactics toward African Americans, while many other whites migrated to more racially homogeneous suburban or exurban regions, a process known as white flight. Racially restrictive housing covenants were ruled unenforceable under the Fourteenth Amendment in the 1948 landmark Supreme Court case \"Shelley v. Kraemer\".\n\nElected in 1912, President Woodrow Wilson ordered segregation throughout the federal government. In World War I, blacks served in the United States Armed Forces in segregated units. Black soldiers were often poorly trained and equipped, and were often put on the frontlines in suicide missions. The U.S. military was still heavily segregated in World War II. In addition, no African-American would receive the Medal of Honor during the war, and black soldiers had to sometimes give up their seats in trains to the Nazi prisoners of war.\n\nThe Jim Crow Laws were state and local laws enacted in the Southern and border states of the United States and enforced between 1876 and 1965. They mandated \"separate but equal\" status for black Americans. In reality, this led to treatment and accommodations that were almost always inferior to those which were provided to white Americans. The most important laws required that public schools, public places and public transportation, like trains and buses, have separate facilities for whites and blacks. State-sponsored school segregation was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1954 in \"Brown v. Board of Education\". One of the first federal court cases which challenged segregation in schools was Mendez v. Westminster in 1946.\n\nBy the 1950s, the Civil Rights Movement was gaining momentum. Membership in the NAACP increased in states across the U.S. A 1955 lynching that sparked public outrage about injustice was that of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old boy from Chicago. Spending the summer with relatives in Money, Mississippi, Till was killed for allegedly having wolf-whistled at a white woman. Till had been badly beaten, one of his eyes was gouged out, and he was shot in the head before being thrown into the Tallahatchie River, his body weighed down with a cotton gin fan tied around his neck with barbed wire. David Jackson writes that Mamie Till, Emmett's Mother, \"brought him home to Chicago and insisted on an open casket. Tens of thousands filed past Till's remains, but it was the publication of the searing funeral image in \"Jet\", with a stoic Mamie gazing at her murdered child's ravaged body, that forced the world to reckon with the brutality of American racism.\" News photographs circulated around the country, and drew intense public reaction. The visceral response to his mother's decision to have an open-casket funeral mobilized the black community throughout the U.S. Vann R. Newkirk wrote \"the trial of his killers became a pageant illuminating the tyranny of white supremacy\". The state of Mississippi tried two defendants, Roy Bryant and J.W. Milam, but they were speedily acquitted by an all-white jury.\n\nIn response to heightening discrimination and violence, non-violent acts of protest began to occur. For example, in February 1960, in Greensboro, North Carolina, four young African-American college students entered a Woolworth store and sat down at the counter but were refused service. The men had learned about non-violent protest in college, and continued to sit peacefully as whites tormented them at the counter, pouring ketchup on their heads and burning them with cigarettes. After this, many sit-ins took place in order to non-violently protest against racism and inequality. Sit-ins continued throughout the South and spread to other areas. Eventually, after many sit-ins and other non-violent protests, including marches and boycotts, places began to agree to desegregate.\nIn June 1963, civil rights activist and NAACP member Medgar Evers was assassinated by Byron De La Beckwith, a member of the White Citizens' Council. In his trials for murder De La Beckwith evaded conviction via all-white juries (both trials ended with hung juries).\n\nThe 16th Street Baptist Church bombing marked a turning point during the Civil Rights Era. On Sunday, September 15, 1963 with a stack of dynamite hidden on an outside staircase, Ku Klux Klansmen destroyed one side of the Birmingham church. The bomb exploded in proximity to twenty-six children who were preparing for choir practice in the basement assembly room. The explosion killed four black girls, Carole Robertson (14), Cynthia Wesley (14), Denise McNair (11) and Addie Mae Collins (14).\nWith the bombing occurring only a couple of weeks after Martin Luther King Jr.'s March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, it became an integral aspect of transformed perceptions of conditions for blacks in America. It influenced the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (that banned discrimination in public accommodations, employment, and labor unions) and Voting Rights Act of 1965 which overruled remaining Jim Crow laws. Nonetheless, neither had been implemented by the end of the 1960s as civil rights leaders continued to strive for political and social freedom. \n\nMany U.S. states banned interracial marriage. In 1967, Mildred Loving, a black woman, and Richard Loving, a white man, were sentenced to a year in prison in Virginia for marrying each other. Their marriage violated the state's anti-miscegenation statute, the Racial Integrity Act of 1924, which prohibited marriage between people classified as white and people classified as \"colored\" (persons of non-white ancestry). In the \"Loving v. Virginia\" case in 1967, the Supreme Court invalidated laws prohibiting interracial marriage in the U.S.\nSegregation continued even after the demise of the Jim Crow laws. Data on house prices and attitudes towards integration suggest that in the mid-20th century, segregation was a product of collective actions taken by whites to exclude blacks from their neighborhoods. Segregation also took the form of redlining, the practice of denying or increasing the cost of services, such as banking, insurance, access to jobs, access to health care, or even supermarkets to residents in certain, often racially determined, areas. Although in the U.S. informal discrimination and segregation have always existed, redlining began with the National Housing Act of 1934, which established the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). The practice was fought first through passage of the Fair Housing Act of 1968 (which prevents redlining when the criteria for redlining are based on race, religion, gender, familial status, disability, or ethnic origin), and later through the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which requires banks to apply the same lending criteria in all communities. Although redlining is illegal some argue that it continues to exist in other forms.\n\nUp until the 1940s, the full revenue potential of what was called \"the Negro market\" was largely ignored by white-owned manufacturers in the U.S. with advertising focused on whites. Blacks were also denied commercial deals. On his decision to take part in exhibition races against racehorses in order to earn money, Olympic champion Jesse Owens stated, \"People say that it was degrading for an Olympic champion to run against a horse, but what was I supposed to do? I had four gold medals, but you can't eat four gold medals.\" On the lack of opportunities, Owens added, \"There was no television, no big advertising, no endorsements then. Not for a black man, anyway.\" In the reception to honor his Olympic success Owens was not permitted to enter through the main doors of the Waldorf Astoria New York and instead forced to travel up to the event in a freight elevator. The first black Academy Award recipient Hattie McDaniel was not permitted to attend the premiere of \"Gone with the Wind\" with Georgia being racially segregated, and at the Oscars ceremony in Los Angeles she was required to sit at a segregated table at the far wall of the room; the hotel had a strict no-blacks policy, but allowed McDaniel in as a favor.\n\nAs the civil rights movement and the dismantling of Jim Crow laws in the 1950s and 1960s deepened existing racial tensions in much of the Southern U.S, a Republican Party electoral strategy – the Southern strategy – was enacted in order to increase political support among white voters in the South by appealing to racism against African Americans. Republican politicians such as presidential candidate Richard Nixon and Senator Barry Goldwater developed strategies that successfully contributed to the political realignment of many white, conservative voters in the South who had traditionally supported the Democratic Party rather than the Republican Party. In 1971, angered by African delegates at the UN siding against the U.S. in a vote, then Governor of California Ronald Reagan stated in a phone call to president Nixon, \"To see those... monkeys from those African countries - damn them, they're still uncomfortable wearing shoes!\" The perception that the Republican Party had served as the \"vehicle of white supremacy in the South\", particularly post 1964, made it difficult for the Party to win back the support of black voters in the South in later years.\n\nWhile substantial gains were made in the succeeding decades through middle class advancement and public employment, black poverty and lack of education continued in the context of de-industrialization. Despite gains made after the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing, some violence against black churches has also continued – 145 fires were set to churches around the South in the 1990s, and a mass shooting in Charleston, South Carolina was committed in 2015 at the historic Mother Emanuel Church.\n\nFrom 1981 to 1997, the United States Department of Agriculture discriminated against tens of thousands of black American farmers, denying loans that were provided to white farmers in similar circumstances. The discrimination was the subject of the \"Pigford v. Glickman\" lawsuit brought by members of the National Black Farmers Association, which resulted in two settlement agreements of $1.25 billion in 1999 and of $1.15 billion in 2009.\n\nDuring the 1980s and '90s a number of riots occurred that were related to longstanding racial tensions between police and minority communities. The 1980 Miami riots were catalyzed by the killing of an African-American motorist by four white Miami-Dade Police officers. They were subsequently acquitted on charges of manslaughter and evidence tampering. Similarly, the six-day 1992 Los Angeles riots erupted after the acquittal of four white LAPD officers who had been filmed beating Rodney King, an African-American motorist. Khalil Gibran Muhammad, the Director of the Harlem-based Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture has identified more than 100 instances of mass racial violence in the United States since 1935 and has noted that almost every instance was precipitated by a police incident.\n\nPolitically, the \"winner-take-all\" structure that applies to 48 out of 50 states in the electoral college benefits white representation, as no state has voters of color as the majority of the electorate. This has been described as structural bias and often leads voters of color to feel politically alienated, and therefore not to vote. The lack of representation in Congress has also led to lower voter turnout. As of 2016, African Americans only made up 8.7% of Congress, and Latinos 7%.\n\nMany cite the 2008 United States presidential election as a step forward in race relations: white Americans played a role in electing Barack Obama, the country's first black president. In fact, Obama received a greater percentage of the white vote (43%), than did the previous Democratic candidate, John Kerry (41%). Racial divisions persisted throughout the election; wide margins of Black voters gave Obama an edge during the presidential primary, where 8 out of 10 African-Americans voted for him in the primaries, and an MSNBC poll found that race was a key factor in whether a candidate was perceived as being ready for office. In South Carolina, for instance,\"Whites were far likelier to name Clinton than Obama as being most qualified to be commander in chief, likeliest to unite the country and most apt to capture the White House in November. Blacks named Obama over Clinton by even stronger margins—two- and three-to one—in all three areas.\"\n\nSociologist Russ Long stated in 2013 that there is now a more subtle racism that associates a specific race with a specific characteristic. In a 1993 study conducted by Katz and Braly, it was presented that \"blacks and whites hold a variety of stereotypes towards each other, often negative\". The Katz and Braley study also found that African-Americans and whites view the traits that they identify each other with as threatening, interracial communication between the two is likely to be \"hesitant, reserved, and concealing\". Interracial communication is guided by stereotypes; stereotypes are transferred into personality and character traits which then have an effect on communication. Multiple factors go into how stereotypes are established, such as age and the setting in which they are being applied. For example, in a study done by the Entman-Rojecki Index of Race and Media in 2014, 89% of black women in movies are shown swearing and exhibiting offensive behavior while only 17% of white women are portrayed in this manner.\n\nIn 2012, Trayvon Martin, a seventeen-year-old teenager was fatally shot by George Zimmerman in Sanford, Florida. Zimmerman, a neighborhood-watch volunteer, claimed that Martin was being suspicious and called the Sanford police to report him. Between ending his call with police and their arrival, Zimmerman fatally shot Martin outside of the townhouse he was staying at following an altercation. Zimmerman was injured in the altercation and claimed self-defense. The incident caused national outrage after Zimmerman was not charged over the shooting. The national coverage of the incident lead Sandford police to arrest Zimmerman and charge him with second-degree murder, but he was found not guilty at trial. Public outcry followed the acquittal and created an abundance of mistrust between minorities and the Sanford police. \n\nIn 2014, the police shooting of Michael Brown, an African American, in Ferguson, Missouri lead to widespread unrest in the town. In the years following, mass media has followed other high profile police shootings of African-Americans, often with video evidence from police body-worn cameras. Amongst 15 high-profile police shooting deaths of African-Americans, only 1 officer faced prison time. High-profile shooting deaths of African-Americans lead to the creation of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nThe U.S. Justice department launched the National Center for Building Community Trust and Justice in 2014. This program collects data concerning racial profiling to create change in the criminal justice system concerning implicit and explicit racial bias towards African-Americans as well as other minorities.\n\nIn August 2017, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination issued a rare warning to the US and its leadership to \"unequivocally and unconditionally\" condemn racist speech and crime, following violence in Charlottesville during a rally organized by white nationalists, white supremacists, Klansmen, neo-Nazis and various right-wing militias in July.\n\nOn 25 May 2020, an African American man died after being handcuffed and pinned to the ground by an officer of the Minneapolis Police Department. According to videos that circulated on social media, 46-year-old George Floyd was killed after a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, forced his knee on Floyd's neck for several minutes. All four officers present were fired the next day. Floyd’s death sparked a wave of violent protests across the US, beginning in Minneapolis.\n\nAsian Americans, including those of East Asian, Southeast Asian, and South Asian descent, have experienced racism since the first major groups of Chinese immigrants arrived in America. The Naturalization Act of 1790 made Asians ineligible for citizenship. First-generation immigrants, children of immigrants, and Asians adopted by non-Asian families are still impacted by discrimination.\n\nDuring the Industrial Revolution in the United States, labor shortages in the mining and rail industries were prevalent. Chinese immigrant labor was often used to fill this gap, most notably with the construction of the First Transcontinental Railroad, leading to large-scale Chinese immigration. These Chinese immigrants were seen as taking the jobs of whites for cheaper pay, and the phrase Yellow Peril, which predicted the demise of Western Civilization as a result of Chinese immigrants, gained popularity.\n\nThe 1879 Constitution of the State of California prohibited employment of Chinese people by state and local governments, and by businesses incorporated in California. Also, the 1879 California constitution delegated power to local governments of California to remove Chinese people from within their borders. The Chinese Exclusion Act banning immigration of Chinese people was enacted on the national level in 1882, while the immigration of people from Asian countries in addition to China was banned by the sweeping Immigration Act of 1917, also known as the Asiatic Barred Zone Act, which also banned homosexuals, people with intellectual disability, and people with an anarchist worldview. The Chinese Exclusion Act was the first time that a law was passed to exclude a major ethnic group from the nation.\n\nSeveral massacres of Chinese people, including the Rock Springs massacre of 1885 and the Hells Canyon massacre of 1887 further exemplified deep American racist animus against Chinese people.\n\nLocal discriminatory laws were also enacted to stifle Chinese business and job opportunities; for example, in the 1886 Supreme Court case of \"Yick Wo v. Hopkins\", a San Francisco city ordinance requiring permits for laundries (which were mostly Chinese-owned) was struck down, as it was evident the law solely targeted Chinese Americans. When the law was in effect, the city issued permits to virtually all non-Chinese permit applicants, while only granting one permit out of two hundred applications from Chinese laundry owners. When the Chinese laundries continued to operate, the city tried to fine the owners. In 1913, California, home to many Chinese immigrants, enacted an Alien Land Law, which significantly restricted land ownership by Asian immigrants, and extended it in 1920, ultimately banning virtually all land ownership by Asians.\n\nJapanese immigrants, who were unaffected by the Chinese Exclusion Act, began to enter the United States in large numbers in 1907, filling jobs that were once filled by Chinese workers. This influx also led to discrimination and President Theodore Roosevelt restricted Japanese immigration. Later, Japanese immigration was closed when Japan entered into the Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907 to stop issuing passports to Japanese workers intending to move to the U.S.\n\nDuring World War II, the Republic of China was an ally of the United States, and the federal government praised the resistance of the Chinese against Japan in the Second Sino-Japanese War, in an attempt to reduce anti-Chinese sentiment. In 1943, the Magnuson Act was passed by Congress, repealing the Chinese Exclusion Act and reopening Chinese immigration. However, at the time, the United States was actively fighting the Empire of Japan, which was a member of the Axis powers. Anti-Japanese racism, which spiked after the attack on Pearl Harbor, was tacitly encouraged by the government, which used slurs such as \"Jap\" in propaganda posters and even interned Japanese Americans, citing possible security threats. American soldiers in the Pacific theater often dehumanized their enemy, leading them to mutilate Japanese war dead. The racist nature of this dehumanization is apparent in the inconsistency of the treatment of corpses in the Pacific and the European theaters. Apparently some soldiers mailed Japanese skulls home as souvenirs, while none of them mailed German or Italian skulls home. This prejudice continued to exist for some time after the end of the war, and anti-Asian racism also affected U.S. policy during the Korean and Vietnam Wars, even though Asians fought on both sides during those wars as well as during World War II. Some historians have alleged that a climate of racism, with unofficial rules like the \"mere gook rule\", allowed a pattern to exist in which South Vietnamese civilians were treated as if they were less than human and war crimes became common.\n\nPrior to 1965, Indian immigration to the U.S. was small and isolated, with fewer than 50,000 Indian immigrants in the country. The Bellingham riots in Bellingham, Washington, on September 5, 1907, epitomized the low tolerance in the U.S. for Indians and Hindus. While anti-Asian racism was embedded in U.S. politics and culture in the early 20th century, Indians were also racialized, with U.S. officials casting them as \"Hindu menaces\" and pushing for Western imperial expansion abroad. In the 1923 case, \"United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind\", the Supreme Court ruled that high caste Hindus were not \"white persons\" and were therefore racially ineligible for naturalized citizenship. The Court argued that the racial difference between Indians and whites was so great that the \"great body of our people\" would reject assimilation with Indians. It was after the Luce–Celler Act of 1946 that a quota of 100 Indians per year could immigrate to the U.S. and become citizens.\n\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional Northern European and Germanic groups, and as a result, it would significantly, and unintentionally, alter the demographic mix in the U.S. On the U.S. immigration laws prior to 1965, sociologist Stephen Klineberg stated the law \"declared that Northern Europeans are a superior subspecies of the white race.\" In 1990, Asian immigration was encouraged when nonimmigrant temporary working visas were given to help with the shortage of skilled labor within the United States.\n\nIn modern times, Asians have been perceived as a \"model minority\". They are categorized as more educated and successful, and are stereotyped as intelligent and hard-working, but socially inept. Asians may experience expectations of natural intelligence and excellence from whites as well as other minorities. This has led to discrimination in the workplace, as Asian Americans may face unreasonable expectations because of this stereotype. According to the Journal of Organizational Behavior, in 2000, out of 1,218 adult Asian Americans, 92 percent of those who experienced personal discrimination believed that the unfair treatment was due to their ethnicity.\nThese stereotypes can also obstruct career paths; because Asians are seen as better skilled in engineering, computing, and mathematics, they are often encouraged to pursue technical careers. They are also discouraged from pursuing non-technical occupations or executive occupations requiring more social interaction, since Asians are perceived to have poor social skills. In the 2000 study, forty percent of those surveyed who experienced discrimination believed that they had lost hiring or promotion opportunities. In 2007, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission reported that Asians make up 10 percent of professional jobs, while 3.7 percent of them held executive, senior level, or manager positions.\n\nOther forms of discrimination against Asian Americans include racial profiling and hate crimes. The FBI noted that in 2015, 3.2 percent of all hate crimes involved anti-Asian bias. In 2016, the Seattle Police Department reported that there was a 40 percent increase in race-based crimes against Asian-Americans, both criminal and non-criminal.\n\nResearch shows that discrimination has led to more use of informal mental health services by Asian Americans. Asian Americans who feel discriminated against also tend to smoke more.\n\nThere have been widespread incidents of xenophobia and racism against Chinese Americans and other Asian Americans.\n\nVarious European American immigrant groups have been subjected to discrimination either on the basis of their immigrant status (known as \"Nativism\") or on the basis of their ethnicities (country of origin).\nIn the 19th century, this was particularly true because of anti-Irish prejudice, which was based on anti-Catholic sentiment, and prejudice against the Irish as an ethnicity. This was especially true for Irish Catholics who immigrated to the U.S. in the mid-19th century; the large number of Irish (both Catholic and Protestant) who settled in America in the 18th century had largely (but not entirely) escaped such discrimination and eventually blended into the white American population. During the 1830s in the U.S., riots over control of job sites broke out in rural areas among rival labor teams from different parts of Ireland, and between Irish and local American work teams competing for construction jobs.\n\nThe Native American Party, commonly called the Know Nothing movement was a political party, whose membership was limited to Protestant men, that operated on a national basis during the mid-1850s and sought to limit the influence of Irish Catholics and other immigrants, thus reflecting nativism and anti-Catholic sentiment. There was widespread anti-Irish job discrimination in the United States and \"No Irish need apply\" signs were common.\n\nThe second era Ku Klux Klan was a very large nationwide organization in the 1920s, consisting of between four to six million members (15% of the nation's eligible population) that especially opposed Catholics. The revival of the Klan was spurred by the release of the 1915 film \"The Birth of a Nation\". The second and third incarnations of the Ku Klux Klan made frequent references to America's \"Anglo-Saxon\" blood. Anti-Catholic sentiment, which appeared in North America with the first Pilgrim and Puritan settlers in New England in the early 17th century, remained evident in the United States up to the presidential campaign of John F. Kennedy, who went on to become the first Catholic U.S. president in 1961.\nThe 20th century saw discrimination against immigrants from southern and eastern Europe (notably Italian Americans and Polish Americans), partly from anti-Catholic sentiment (as well as discrimination against Irish Americans), and partly from Nordicism. The primary spokesman for Nordicism was the eugenicist Madison Grant. His 1916 book, \"The Passing of the Great Race, or the Racial Basis of European History\" about Nordicism was highly influential among racial thinking and government policy making in the U.S.\n\nAn advocate of the U.S. immigration laws that favored Northern Europeans, the Klansman Lothrop Stoddard wrote primarily on the alleged dangers posed by \"colored\" peoples to white civilization, with his most famous book \"The Rising Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy\" in 1920. Nordicism led to the reduction in Southern European, along with Slavic Eastern European and Russian immigrants in the National Origins Formula of the Emergency Quota Act of 1921 and the Immigration Act of 1924, whose goal was to maintain the status quo distribution of ethnicity by limiting immigration of non-Northern Europeans. According to the U.S. Department of State the purpose of the act was \"to preserve the ideal of American homogeneity\". The racial term \"Untermensch\" originates from the title of Stoddard's 1922 book \"The Revolt Against Civilization: The Menace of the Under-man\". It was later adopted by the Nazis (and its chief racial theorist Alfred Rosenberg) from that book's German version \"Der Kulturumsturz: Die Drohung des Untermenschen\" (1925).\n\nThere was also discrimination against German Americans and Italian Americans due to Germany and Italy being enemy countries during World War I (Germany) and World War II (Germany and Italy). This resulted in a sharp decrease in German-American ethnic identity and a sharp decrease in the use of German in the United States following World War I, which had hitherto been significant, and to German American internment and Italian American internment during World War II; see also World War I anti-German sentiment.\n\nBeginning in World War I, German Americans were sometimes accused of having political allegiances to Germany, and thus not to the United States. The Justice Department attempted to prepare a list of all German aliens, counting approximately 480,000 of them, more than 4,000 of whom were imprisoned in 1917–18. The allegations included spying for Germany, or endorsing the German war effort. Thousands were forced to buy war bonds to show their loyalty. The Red Cross barred individuals with German last names from joining in fear of sabotage. One person was killed by a mob; in Collinsville, Illinois, German-born Robert Prager was dragged from jail as a suspected spy and lynched. Questions of German American loyalty increased due to events like the German bombing of Black Tom island and the U.S. entering World War I, many German Americans were arrested for refusing allegiance to the U.S. War hysteria led to the removal of German names in public, names of things such as streets, and businesses. Schools also began to eliminate or discourage the teaching of the German language. Years later during the Second World War, German Americans were once again the victims of war hysteria discrimination. Following its entry into the Second World War, the US Government interned at least 11,000 American citizens of German ancestry. The last to be released, a German-American, remained imprisoned until 1948 at Ellis Island, three and a half years after the cessation of hostilities against Germany.\n\nSpecific racism against other European-American ethnicities significantly diminished as a political issue in the 1930s, being replaced by a bi-racialism of black/white, as described and predicted by Lothrop Stoddard, due to numerous causes. The National Origins Formula significantly reduced inflows of non-Nordic ethnicities; the Great Migration (of African-Americans out of the South) displaced anti-white immigrant racism with anti-black racism.\n\nThe Roma population in America has blended more-or-less seamlessly into the rest of American society. In the United States, the term \"Gypsy\" has come to be associated with a trade, a profession, or a lifestyle more than with the Romani ethnic/racial group. Some Americans, especially those self-employed in the fortune-telling and psychic reading business, use the term \"Gypsy\" to describe themselves or their enterprise, despite having no ties to the Roma people. This can be chalked up to misperception and ignorance regarding the term rather than any bigotry or even anti-ziganism.\n\nAmericans of Latin American ancestry (often categorized as \"Hispanic\" or Hispanic and Latino Americans) come from a wide variety of racial and ethnic backgrounds. As a result, not all Latinos are distinguishable as members of a single racial minority.\n\nAfter the Mexican–American War (1846–1848), the United States annexed much of the current Southwestern region from Mexico. Mexicans who resided in that territory were subjected to discrimination. It is estimated that at least 597 Mexicans were lynched between 1848 and 1928 (this is a conservative estimate due to the fact that there was a lack of records when many reported lynchings were committed). Between 1880 and 1930, Mexicans were lynched at a rate of 27.4 per 100,000 people. This lynching statistic is second only to the statistic within the African American community, which suffered an average of 37.1 lynchings per 100,000 people during the same period. Between 1848 and 1879, Mexicans were lynched at an unprecedented rate of 473 per 100,000 people.\n\nDuring the Great Depression, the U.S. government sponsored a Mexican Repatriation program which was intended to encourage Mexican immigrants to voluntarily return to Mexico, however, many were forcibly removed against their will. In total, up to one million persons of Mexican ancestry were deported, approximately 60 percent of those individuals were actually U.S. citizens.\n\nThe Zoot Suit riots were vivid incidents of racial violence against Latinos (e.g., Mexican-Americans) in Los Angeles in 1943. Naval servicemen stationed in a Latino neighborhood conflicted with youth in the dense neighborhood. Frequent confrontations between small groups and individuals had intensified and erupted into several days of non-stop rioting. Large mobs of servicemen would enter civilian quarters looking to attack Mexican American youths, some of whom were wearing zoot suits, a distinctive exaggerated fashion popular among that group. For several days, the disturbances continued unchecked , and the local police even participated in them before base commanders declared downtown Los Angeles and Mexican American neighborhoods off-limits to servicemen.\n\nMany public institutions, businesses, and homeowners associations officially excluded Mexican Americans as a matter of policy. School children of Mexican American descent were subjected to racial segregation in the public school system. In many counties, Mexican Americans were excluded from serving as jurors in court cases, especially in those that involved Mexican American defendants. In many areas across the Southwest, they lived in separate residential areas, due to laws and real estate company policies.\n\nDuring the 1960s, Mexican American youth formed the Chicano Civil Rights Movement.\n\nAntisemitism has also played a role in the United States. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, hundreds of thousands of ethnic Jews escaped the pogroms in Europe. They boarded boats which left ports that were located on the Baltic Sea as well as ports that were located in Northern Germany, and they largely arrived at Ellis Island, New York.\n\nIt is suggested by Leo Rosten, in his book \"The Joys of Yiddish\", that as soon as they left their boats, they were subjected to racism by the port immigration authorities. The derogatory term \"kike\" was adopted in reference to Jews (because most of them could not write and as a result, they may have signed their immigration papers with circles – or kikels in Yiddish). Efforts were also made by the Asiatic Exclusion League to bar Jewish immigrants (along with other Middle Eastern ethnic groups, like Arabs, Assyrians, and Armenians) from naturalization, but they (along with Assyrians and Armenians) were nevertheless granted US citizenship, despite being classified as Asians.\n\nBeginning in the 1910s, Southern Jewish communities were attacked by the Ku Klux Klan, which objected to Jewish immigration, and often used \"The Jewish Banker\" caricature in its propaganda. In 1915, Leo Frank was lynched in Georgia after being convicted of rape and sentenced to death (his punishment was commuted to life imprisonment). This event was a catalyst in the re-formation of the new Ku Klux Klan.\n\nEvents in Nazi Germany also attracted attention in the United States. Jewish lobbying for intervention in Europe drew opposition from the isolationists, amongst whom was Father Charles Coughlin, a well known radio priest, who was known to be critical of Jews, believing that they were leading the United States into the war. He preached in weekly, overtly anti-Semitic sermons and, from 1936, began publication of a newspaper, \"Social Justice\", in which he printed anti-Semitic accusations such as \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\".\n\nA number of Jewish organizations, Christian organizations, Muslim organizations, and academics consider the Nation of Islam anti-Semitic. Specifically, they claim that the Nation of Islam has engaged in revisionist and antisemitic interpretations of the Holocaust and exaggerates the role of Jews in the African slave trade. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) alleged that the NOI's Health Minister, Dr. Abdul Alim Muhammad, accused Jewish doctors of injecting blacks with the AIDS virus, an allegation that Muhammad and \"The Washington Post\" have refuted.\n\nAlthough Jews are often considered white by mainstream American society, the relationship between Jews and the concept of whiteness remains complex, with some preferring not to identify as white. Prominent activist and rabbi Michael Lerner argues, in a 1993 \"Village Voice\" article, that \"in America, to be 'white' means to be the beneficiary of the past 500 years of European exploration and exploitation of the rest of the world\" and that \"Jews can only be deemed white if there is massive amnesia on the part of non-Jews about the monumental history of anti-Semitism\". African-American activist Cornel West, in an interview with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, has explained:\n\nIn recent years, some scholars have advanced the concept of \"New antisemitism\", coming simultaneously from the far left, the far right, and radical Islam. This tends to focus on opposition to the creation of a Jewish homeland in the State of Israel, and it also argues that the language of Anti-Zionism and criticism of Israel are both used to attack Jews more broadly. According to this view, the proponents of the new concept believe that criticisms of Israel and Zionism are often disproportionate in degree and unique in kind, and they attribute this to antisemitism.\n\nYehuda Bauer, Professor of Holocaust Studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, has argued that the concept of a \"new antisemitism\" is essentially false since it is in fact an alternative form of the old antisemitism of previous decades, which he believes remains latent at times but recurs whenever it is triggered. In his view, the current trigger is the Israel-Palestine situation; if a compromise making ground in the Arab-Israeli peace process were achieved, he believes that antisemitism would once again decline but not disappear.\n\nNoted critics of Israel, such as Noam Chomsky and Norman Finkelstein, question the extent of new antisemitism in the United States. Chomsky has written in his work \"Necessary Illusions\" that the Anti-Defamation League casts any question of pro-Israeli policy as antisemitism, conflating and muddling issues as even Zionists receive the allegation. Finkelstein has stated that supposed \"new antisemitism\" is a preposterous concept advanced by the ADL to combat critics of Israeli policy.\n\nOn October 27, 2018, Robert D. Bowers opened fire in a synagogue in Pittsburgh with an AR-15-style assault rifle while shouting anti-Semitic racial slurs. This attack resulted in 11 dead and 6 wounded, leaving the assailant charged with 29 criminal counts, one of which was the obstruction of free exercise of religious beliefs. Both President Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel have commented on the event, condemning the attack.\n\nPeople of Middle Eastern and South Asian descent historically occupied an ambiguous racial status in the United States. Middle Eastern and South Asian immigrants were among those who sued in the late 19th and early 20th century to determine whether they were \"white\" immigrants as required by naturalization law. By 1923, courts had vindicated a \"common-knowledge\" standard, concluding that \"scientific evidence\", including the notion of a \"Caucasian race\" including Middle Easterners and many South Asians, was incoherent. Legal scholar John Tehranian argues that in reality this was a \"performance-based\" standard, relating to religious practices, education, intermarriage and a community's role in the United States.\n\nRacism against Arab Americans and racialized Islamophobia against Muslims have risen concomitantly with tensions between the American government and the Islamic world. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, discrimination and racialized violence has markedly increased against Arab Americans and many other religious and cultural groups. Scholars, including Sunaina Maira and Evelyn Alsultany, argue that in the post-September 11 climate, the markers of the racialization of Muslim Americans are cultural, political, and religious rather than phenotypic.\n\nArab Americans in particular were most demonized after the September 11 attacks, which led to hatred towards Middle Easterners living in the United States and elsewhere in the Western world. There have been attacks against Arabs not only on the basis of their religion (Islam), but also on the basis of their ethnicity; numerous Christian Arabs have been attacked based on their appearances. In addition, other Middle Eastern peoples (Persians, Assyrians, Azerbaijanis, Jews, Turks, Yazidis, Kurds, etc.) who are mistaken for Arabs because of perceived similarities in appearance have been collateral victims of anti-Arabism.\n\nNon-Arab and non-Muslim Middle Eastern people, as well as South Asians of different ethnic/religious backgrounds (Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs) have been stereotyped as \"Arabs\" and racialized in a similar manner. The case of Balbir Singh Sodhi, a Sikh who was murdered at a Phoenix gas station by a white supremacist for \"looking like an Arab terrorist\" (because of the turban, a requirement of Sikhism), as well as that of Hindus being attacked for \"being Muslims\" have achieved prominence and criticism following the September 11 attacks.\n\nThose of Middle Eastern descent who are in the United States military face racism from fellow soldiers. Army Spc Zachari Klawonn endured numerous instances of racism during his enlistment at Fort Hood, Texas. During his basic training, he was made to put cloth around his head and play the role of terrorist. His fellow soldiers had to take him down to the ground and draw guns on him. He was also called things such as \"raghead\", \"sand monkey\", and \"Zachari bin Laden\".\nAccording to a 2004 study, although official parameters encompass Arabs as part of the \"white American\" racial category, some Arab American adolescents do not identify as white.\n\nRacial profiling is a growing problem for Arab Americans following the September 11 attacks. Particularly in airports, Arab Americans are often subject to heightened security screening, pre-boarding searches and interrogations, and are sometimes denied passage \"based solely on the belief that ethnicity or national origin increases passengers' flight risk.\"\n\nOriginally, passenger profiling was introduced in the 1960s to identify potential hijackers that fit the \"profile\" of a person who is \"likely to be a terrorist.\" However, this practice was discontinued in 1972 due to inefficiencies and was replaced by checkpoints and x-ray security. The Department Of Justice released a statement in 1997 claiming that automated passenger screenings would not have a \"disparate impact on any group of passengers.\" The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) believes that \"profiling, even under the best circumstances, provides an opportunity for the prejudices and stereotypes held by law enforcement and other officials to be expressed through discriminatory application of profiles. At worst, they are simply a recipe for bigoted behavior.\"\n\nThe November 1979 Iranian hostage crisis of the U.S. embassy in Tehran precipitated a wave of anti-Iranian sentiment in the United States, directed both against the new Islamic regime and Iranian nationals and immigrants. Even though such sentiments gradually declined after the release of the hostages at the start of 1981, they sometimes flare up. In response, some Iranian immigrants to the U.S. have distanced themselves from their nationality and instead identify primarily on the basis of their ethnic or religious affiliations.\n\nSince the 1980s and especially since the 1990s, it has been argued, Hollywood's depiction of Iranians has gradually shown signs of vilifying Iranians. Hollywood network productions such as \"24\", \"John Doe\", \"On Wings of Eagles\" (1986), \"\" (1981), and \"JAG\" almost regularly host Persian speaking villains in their story line.\n\nIndian Americans have sometimes been mistaken in the United States for Arab or Muslim, and thus many of the same prejudices faced by Arab Americans have been experienced by Indian Americans also, regardless of actual religious or ethnic background.\n\nIn the 1980s, a gang known as the Dotbusters specifically targeted Indian Americans in Jersey City, New Jersey with violence and harassment. Studies of racial discrimination, as well as stereotyping and scapegoating of Indian Americans have been conducted in recent years. In particular, racial discrimination against Indian Americans in the workplace has been correlated with Indophobia due to the rise in outsourcing/offshoring, whereby Indian Americans are blamed for US companies offshoring white-collar labor to India. According to the offices of the Congressional Caucus on India, many Indian Americans are severely concerned of a backlash, though nothing serious has taken place yet. Due to various socio-cultural reasons, implicit racial discrimination against Indian Americans largely go unreported by the Indian American community.\n\nNumerous cases of religious stereotyping of American Hindus (mainly of Indian origin) have also been documented.\n\nSince the September 11, 2001 attacks, there have been scattered incidents of Indian Americans becoming mistaken targets for hate crimes. In one example, a Sikh, Balbir Singh Sodhi, was murdered at a Phoenix gas station in a hate crime. This happened after September 11, and the murderer claimed that his turban made him think that the victim was a Middle Eastern American. In another example, a pizza deliverer was mugged and beaten in Massachusetts for \"being Muslim\" though the victim pleaded with the assailants that he was in fact a Hindu. In December 2012, an Indian American in New York City was pushed from behind onto the tracks at the 40th Street-Lowery Street station in Sunnyside and killed. The police arrested a woman, Erika Menendez, who admitted to the act and justified it, stating that she shoved him onto the tracks because she believed that he was \"a Hindu or a Muslim\" and she wanted to retaliate for the attacks on September 11, 2001.\n\nUsing The Schedule of Racist Events (SRE), an 18-item self-report inventory that assesses the frequency of racist discrimination, Hope Landrine and Elizabeth A. Klonoff found that racist discrimination is rampant in the lives of African Americans and is strongly related to psychiatric symptoms. A study on racist events in the lives of African American women found that lifetime experiences of racism were positively related to lifetime history of both physical disease and frequency of recent common colds. These relationships were largely unaccounted for by other variables. Demographic variables such as income and education were not related to experiences of racism. The results suggest that racism can be detrimental to African American's well being. The physiological stress caused by racism has been documented in studies by Claude Steele, Joshua Aronson, and Steven Spencer on what they term \"stereotype threat.\" Quite similarly, another example of the psychosocial consequences of discrimination have been observed in a study sampling Mexican-origin participants in Fresno, California. It was found that perceived discrimination is correlated with depressive symptoms, especially for those less acculturated in the United States, like Mexican immigrants and migrants.\n\nAlong the vein of somatic responses to discrimination, Kennedy et al. found that both measures of collective disrespect were strongly correlated with black mortality (r = 0.53 to 0.56), as well as with white mortality (r = 0.48 to 0.54). These data suggest that racism, measured as an ecologic characteristic, is associated with higher mortality in both blacks and whites. Some researchers also suggest that racial segregation may lead to disparities in health and mortality. Thomas LaVeist (1989; 1993) tested the hypothesis that segregation would aid in explaining race differences in infant mortality rates across cities. Analyzing 176 large and midsized cities, LaVeist found support for the hypothesis. Since LaVeist's studies, segregation has received increased attention as a determinant of racial disparities in mortality. Studies have shown that mortality rates for male and female African Americans are lower in areas with lower levels of residential segregation. Mortality for male and female whites was not associated in either direction with residential segregation.\n\nResearchers Sharon A. Jackson, Roger T. Anderson, Norman J. Johnson and Paul D. Sorlie found that, after adjustment for family income, mortality risk increased with increasing minority residential segregation among Blacks aged 25 to 44 years and non-Blacks aged 45 to 64 years. In most age/race/gender groups, the highest and lowest mortality risks occurred in the highest and lowest categories of residential segregation, respectively. These results suggest that minority residential segregation may influence mortality risk and underscore the traditional emphasis on the social underpinnings of disease and death. Rates of heart disease among African Americans are associated with the segregation patterns in the neighborhoods where they live (Fang \"et al.\" 1998). Stephanie A. Bond Huie writes that neighborhoods affect health and mortality outcomes primarily in an indirect fashion through environmental factors such as smoking, diet, exercise, stress, and access to health insurance and medical providers. Moreover, segregation strongly influences premature mortality in the US.\n\nAs early as 1866, the Civil Rights Act provided a remedy for intentional race discrimination in employment by private employers and state and local public employers. The Civil Rights Act of 1871 applies to public employment or employment involving state action prohibiting deprivation of rights secured by the federal constitution or federal laws through action under color of law. Title VII is the principal federal statute with regard to employment discrimination prohibiting unlawful employment discrimination by public and private employers, labor organizations, training programs and employment agencies based on race or color, religion, gender, and national origin. Title VII also prohibits retaliation against any person for opposing any practice forbidden by statute, or for making a charge, testifying, assisting, or participating in a proceeding under the statute. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 expanded the damages available in Title VII cases and granted Title VII plaintiffs the right to a jury trial. Title VII also provides that race and color discrimination against every race and color is prohibited.\n\nMedia\n\nPopular culture (songs, theater) for European American audiences in the 19th century created and perpetuated negative stereotypes of African Americans. One key symbol of racism against African Americans was the use of blackface. Directly related to this was the institution of minstrelsy. Other stereotypes of African Americans included the fat, dark-skinned \"mammy\" and the irrational, hypersexual male \"buck\".\n\nIn recent years increasing numbers of African-American activists have asserted that rap music videos commonly utilize scantily clothed African-American performers posing as thugs or pimps. The NAACP and the National Congress of Black Women also have called for the reform of images on videos and on television. Julian Bond said that in a segregated society, people get their impressions of other groups from what they see in videos and what they hear in music.\nIn a similar vein, activists protested against the BET show, \"Hot Ghetto Mess,\" which satirizes the culture of working-class African-Americans. The protests resulted in the change of the television show name to \"We Got to Do Better.\"\n\nIt is understood that representations of minorities in the media have the ability to reinforce or change stereotypes. For example, in one study, a collection of white subjects were primed by a comedy skit either showing a stereotypical or neutral portrayal of African-American characters. Participants were then required to read a vignette describing an incident of sexual violence, with the alleged offender either white or black, and assign a rating for perceived guilt. For those shown the stereotypical African-American character, there was a significantly higher guilt rating for black alleged offender in the subsequent vignette, in comparison to the other conditions.\n\nWhile schemas have an overt societal consequence, the strong development of them have lasting effect on recipients. Overall, it is found that strong in-group attitudes are correlated with academic and economic success. In a study analyzing the interaction of assimilation and racial-ethnic schemas for Hispanic youth found that strong schematic identities for Hispanic youth undermined academic achievement.\n\nAdditional stereotypes attributed to minorities continue to influence societal interactions. For example, a 1993 Harvard Law Review article states that Asian-Americans are commonly viewed as submissive, as a combination of relative physical stature and Western comparisons of cultural attitudes. Furthermore, Asian-Americans are depicted as the model minority, unfair competitors, foreigners, and indistinguishable. These stereotypes can serve to dehumanize Asian-Americans and catalyze hostility and violence.\n\nFormal discrimination against minorities has been present throughout American history. Leland T. Saito, Associate Professor of Sociology and American Studies & Ethnicity at the University of Southern California, writes, \"Political rights have been circumscribed by race, class and gender since the founding of the United States, when the right to vote was restricted to white men of property. Throughout the history of the United States race has been used by whites – a category that has also shifted through time – for legitimizing and creating difference and social, economic and political exclusion.\"\n\nWithin education, a survey of black students in sixteen majority white universities found that four of five African-Americans reported some form of racial discrimination. For example, in February 1988, the University of Michigan enforced a new anti discrimination code following the distribution of fliers saying blacks \"don't belong in classrooms, they belong hanging from trees\". Other forms of reported discrimination were refusal to sit next to black in lecture, ignored input in class settings, and informal segregation. While the penalties are imposed, the psychological consequences of formal discrimination can still manifest. Black students, for example, reported feelings of heightened isolation and suspicion. Furthermore, studies have shown that academic performance is stunted for black students with these feelings as a result of their campus race interactions.\n\nMinority racism is sometimes considered controversial because of theories of power in society. Some theories of racism insist that racism can only exist in the context of social power to impose it upon others. Yet discrimination and racism between racially marginalized groups has been noted. For example, there has been ongoing violence between African American and Mexican American gangs, particularly in Southern California. There have been reports of racially motivated attacks against Mexican Americans who have moved into neighborhoods occupied mostly by African Americans, and vice versa. According to gang experts and law enforcement agents, a longstanding race war between the Mexican Mafia and the Black Guerilla Family, a rival African American prison gang, has generated such intense racial hatred among Mexican Mafia leaders, or shot callers, that they have issued a \"green light\" on all blacks. This amounts to a standing authorization for Latino gang members to prove their mettle by terrorizing or even murdering any blacks sighted in a neighborhood claimed by a gang loyal to the Mexican Mafia. There have been several significant riots in California prisons where Mexican American inmates and African Americans have targeted each other particularly, based on racial reasons.\n\nThere has also been noted conflict between recent immigrant groups and their established ethnic counterparts within the United States. Rapid growth in African and Caribbean immigrants has come into conflict with American blacks. Interaction and cooperation between black immigrants and American blacks are, ironically, debatable. One can argue that racial discrimination and cooperation is not ordinarily based on color of skin but more on shared common, cultural experiences, and beliefs.\n\nIn a manner that defines interpersonal discrimination in the United States, Darryl Brown of the Virginia Law Review states that while \"our society has established a consensus against blatant, intentional racism and in decades since Brown v Board of Education has developed a sizeable set of legal remedies to address it\", our legal system \"ignores the possibility that 'race' is structural or interstitial, that it can be the root of injury even when not traceable to a specific intention or action\"\n\nInterpersonal discrimination is defined by its subtlety. Unlike formal discrimination, interpersonal discrimination is often not an overt or deliberate act of racism. For example, in an incident regarding a racial remark from a professor at Virginia Law, a rift was created by conflicting definitions of racism. For the students that defended the professor's innocence, \"racism was defined as an act of intentional maliciousness\". Yet for African Americans, racism was broadened to a detrimental influence on \"the substantive dynamics of the classroom\". As an effect, it is argued that the \"daily repetition of subtle racism and subordination in the classroom and on campus can ultimately be, for African Americans, more productive of stress, anxiety and alienation than even blatant racists acts\". Moreover, the attention to these acts of discrimination diverts energy from academics, becoming a distraction that white students do not generally face.\n\nInstitutional racism is the theory that aspects of the structure, pervasive attitudes, and the established institutions in society disadvantage some racial groups, although not with an overtly discriminatory mechanism. There are several factors that play into institutional racism, including but not limited to: accumulated wealth/benefits from racial groups that have benefited from past discrimination, educational and occupational disadvantages faced by non-native English speakers in the United States, ingrained stereotypical images that still remain in the society (e.g. black men are likely to be criminals).\n\nIn his article, Peter Kaufman describes three instances in which institutional racism has contributed to current views of race. These are:\n\nAccess to United States citizenship was restricted by race, beginning with the Naturalization Act of 1790 which excluded \"non-whites\" from citizenship.\nInstitutionalized prejudice existed against white followers of Roman Catholicism who immigrated from countries such as Ireland, Germany, Italy and France. Other efforts include the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act and the 1924 National Origins Act. The Immigration Act of 1924 was aimed at further restricting the Southern and Eastern Europeans who had begun to enter the country in large numbers beginning in the 1890s. By limiting immigration of non-Northern Europeans, according to the U.S. Department of State Office of the Historian the purpose of the 1924 act was \"to preserve the ideal of American homogeneity\".\n\nFollowing the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 that ended a racist preference for white immigrants dating to the 18th century, white nationalism grew in the United States as the conservative movement developed in mainstream society. Political scientist Samuel P. Huntington argues that it developed as a reaction to a perceived decline in the essence of American identity as European, Anglo-Protestant and English-speaking.\n\nIn conjunction with immigration reform in the late 1980s (seen with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986), there have been noted IRCA-related discriminatory behavior toward Hispanics within employment. As the measure made it unlawful to hire without authorization to work in the United States, avoidant treatment toward \"foreign-appearing workers\" increased to bypass the required record-keeping or risk of sanctions.\n\nHitler and other Nazis praised America's system of institutional racism and they also believed that it was the model which should be followed in their Reich. In particular, they believed that it was the model for the expansion of German territory into the territory of other nations and the elimination of their indigenous inhabitants, for the implementation of racist immigration laws which banned some races, and laws which denied full citizenship to blacks, which they also wanted to implement against Jews. Hitler's book \"Mein Kampf\" extolled America as the only contemporary example of a country with racist (\"völkisch\") citizenship statutes in the 1920s, and Nazi lawyers made use of the American models in crafting laws for Nazi Germany. U.S. citizenship laws and anti-miscegenation laws directly inspired the two principal Nuremberg Laws—the Citizenship Law and the Blood Law. Establishing a restrictive entry system for Germany, Hitler admiringly wrote: \"The American Union categorically refuses the immigration of physically unhealthy elements, and simply excludes the immigration of certain races.\"\n\nLarge racial differentials in wealth remain in the United States: between whites and African Americans, the gap is a factor of twenty. An analyst of the phenomenon, Thomas Shapiro, professor of law and social policy at Brandeis University argues, \"The wealth gap is not just a story of merit and achievement, it's also a story of the historical legacy of race in the United States.\" Differentials applied to the Social Security Act (which excluded agricultural workers, a sector that then included most black workers), rewards to military officers, and the educational benefits offered returning soldiers after World War II. Pre-existing disparities in wealth are exacerbated by tax policies that reward investment over waged income, subsidize mortgages, and subsidize private sector developers.\n\nThere are major racial differences in access to health care and in the quality of health care provided. A study published in the American Journal of Public Health estimated that: \"over 886,000 deaths could have been prevented from 1991 to 2000 if African Americans had received the same care as whites\". The key differences they cited were lack of insurance, inadequate insurance, poor service, and reluctance to seek care. A history of government-sponsored experimentation, such as the notorious Tuskegee Syphilis Study has left a legacy of African American distrust of the medical system.\n\nInequalities in health care may also reflect a systemic bias in the way medical procedures and treatments are prescribed for different ethnic groups. A University of Edinburgh Professor of Public Health, Raj Bhopal, writes that the history of racism in science and medicine shows that people and institutions behave according to the ethos of their times and warns of dangers to avoid in the future. A Harvard Professor of Social Epidemiology contended that much modern research supported the assumptions needed to justify racism. Racism she writes underlies unexplained inequities in health care, including treatment for heart disease, renal failure, bladder cancer, and pneumonia. Bhopal writes that these inequalities have been documented in various studies and that there are consistent findings that black Americans receive less health care than white Americans—particularly where this involves expensive new technology. The University of Michigan Health study found in 2010 that black patients in pain clinics received 50% of the amount of drugs that other patients who were white received. Black pain in medicine links to the racial disparities between pain management and racial bias on behalf of the health professional. In 2011, Vermont organizers took a proactive stand against racism in their communities to defeat the biopolitical struggles faced on a daily basis. The first and only universal health care law was passed in the state.\n\nIt is argued that racial coding of concepts like crime and welfare has been used to strategically influence public political views. Racial coding is implicit; it incorporates racially primed language or imagery to allude to racial attitudes and thinking. For example, in the context of domestic policy, it is argued that Ronald Reagan implied linkages between concepts like \"special interests\" and \"big government\" with ill-perceived minority groups in the 1980s, using the conditioned negativity toward the minority groups to discredit certain policies and programs during campaigns. In a study analyzing how political ads prime attitudes, Valentino compares the voting responses of participants after being exposed to narration of a George W. Bush advertisement paired with three different types of visuals with different embedded racial cues to create three conditions: neutral, race comparison, and undeserving blacks. For example, as the narrator states \"Democrats want to spend your tax dollars on wasteful government programs\", the video shows an image of a black woman and child in an office setting. Valentino found that the undeserving blacks condition produced the largest primed effect in racialized policies, like opposition to affirmative action and welfare spending.\n\nIan Haney López, Professor of Law at the University of California, Berkeley, refers to this phenomenon as dog-whistle politics, which has pushed, he argues, middle class white Americans to vote against their economic self-interest in order to punish \"undeserving minorities\" who, they believe, are receiving too much public assistance at their expense. According to López, conservative middle-class whites, convinced that minorities are the enemy by powerful economic interests, supported politicians who promised to curb illegal immigration and crack down on crime, but inadvertently they also voted for policies that favor the extremely rich, such as slashing taxes for top income brackets, giving corporations more regulatory control over industry and financial markets, busting unions, cutting pensions for future public employees, reducing funding for public schools, and retrenching the social welfare state. He argues that these same voters cannot link rising inequality which has impacted their lives to the policy agendas they support, which resulted in a massive transfer of wealth to the top 1% of the population since the 1980s.\n\nRacial disparities have been noted in all levels of the U.S. justice system. According to 2009 congressional testimony from Marc Mauer; while African Americans comprise 13% of the US population and 14% of monthly drug users they are 37% of the people arrested for drug offenses; as well as 56% of the people in state prisons for drug offenses. The U.S. Sentencing Commission reported in March 2010 that in the federal system black offenders receive sentences that are 10% longer than white offenders for the same crimes. A July 2009 report by the Sentencing Project found that two-thirds of the people in the U.S. with life sentences are non-white. According to a new report, African-Americans are three times as likely to be killed by police as white Americans.\n\nIn the United States, most crimes in which victims are targeted on the basis of their race or ethnicity are considered hate crimes. (For federal law purposes, crimes in which Hispanics are targeted because of their identity are considered hate crimes based on ethnicity.) Leading forms of bias which are cited in the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, based on law enforcement agency filings include: anti-black, anti-Jewish, anti-white, anti-homosexual, and anti-Hispanic bias in that order in both 2004 and 2005. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, whites, blacks, and Hispanics had similar rates of violent hate crime victimization between 2007 and 2011. However, from 2011 to 2012, violent hate crimes against Hispanic people increased by 300%. When considering all hate crimes, and not just violent ones, African Americans are far more likely to be victims than other racial groups.\n\nThe New Century Foundation, a white nationalist organization founded by Jared Taylor, argues that blacks are more likely to commit hate crimes than whites, and it also argues that FBI figures inflate the number of hate crimes committed by whites by counting Hispanics as \"white\". Other analysts are sharply critical of the NCF's findings, referring to the mainstream criminological view that \"Racial and ethnic data must be treated with caution. Existing research on crime has generally shown that racial or ethnic identity is not predictive of criminal behavior with data which has been controlled for social and economic factors.\" NCF's methodology and statistics are further sharply criticized as flawed and deceptive by anti-racist activists Tim Wise and the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\nThe first post-Jim Crow era hate crime to make sensational media attention was the murder of Vincent Chin, an Asian American of Chinese descent in 1982. He was attacked by two white assailants who were recently laid off from a Detroit area auto factory job and blamed the Japanese for their individual unemployment. Chin was not of Japanese descent, but the assailants testified in the criminal court case that he \"looked like a Jap\", an ethnic slur that is used to describe Japanese and other Asians, and that they were angry enough to beat him to death.\n\nContinuing antisemitism in the United States has remained an issue as the 2011 \"Survey of American Attitudes Toward Jews in America\", released by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), has found that the recent world economic recession increased some antisemitic viewpoints among Americans. Most people express pro-Jewish sentiments, with 64% of those surveyed agreeing that Jews have contributed much to U.S. social culture. Yet the polling found that 19% of Americans answered \"probably true\" to the antisemitic canard that \"Jews have too much control/influence on Wall Street\" while 15% concurred with the related statement that Jews seem \"more willing to use shady practices\" in business. Reflecting on the lingering antisemitism of about one in five Americans, Abraham H. Foxman, ADL national director, has argued, \"It is disturbing that with all of the strides we have made in becoming a more tolerant society, anti-Semitic beliefs continue to hold a vice-grip on a small but not insubstantial segment of the American public.\"\n\nAn ABC News report in 2007 recounted that past ABC polls across several years have tended to find that \"six percent have self-reported prejudice against Jews, 27 percent against Muslims, 25 percent against Arabs,\" and \"one in 10 concedes harboring at least some such feelings\" against Hispanic Americans. The report also remarked that a full 34% of Americans reported \"some racist feelings\" in general as a self-description. An Associated Press and Yahoo News survey of 2,227 adult Americans in 2008 found that 10% of white respondents stated that \"a lot\" of discrimination against African-Americans exists while 45% answered \"some\" compared to 57% of black respondents answering that \"a lot\" exists. In the same poll, more whites applied positive attributes to black Americans than negative ones, with blacks describing whites even more highly, but a significant minority of whites still called their fellow Americans \"irresponsible\", \"lazy\", or other such things.\n\nIn 2008, Stanford University political scientist Paul Sniderman remarked that, in the modern U.S., racism and prejudices are \"a deep challenge, and it's one that Americans in general, and for that matter, political scientists, just haven't been ready to acknowledge fully.\"\n\nIn 2017, citizens gathered in the college community of Charlottesville, Virginia to attend the Unite the Right rally. One woman was killed and dozens of other people were injured when a white supremacist drove his car into a group of counter-protesters. Vice President Mike Pence condemned the violence stating, \"We have no tolerance for hate and violence from white supremacists, neo-Nazis or the KKK. These dangerous fringe groups have no place in American public life and in the American debate and we condemn them in the strongest possible terms.\"\n\nThere is a wide plethora of societal and political suggestions to alleviate the effects of continued discrimination in the United States. For example, within universities, it has been suggested that a type of committee could respond to non-sanctionable behavior.\n\nIt is also argued that there is a need for \"white students and faculty to reformulate white-awareness toward a more secure identity that is not threatened by black cultural institutions and that can recognize the racial non-neutrality of the institutions whites dominate\" (Brown, 334). Paired with this effort, Brown encourages the increase in minority faculty members, so the embedded white normative experience begins to fragment.\n\nWithin media, it is found that racial cues prime racial stereotypic thought. Thus, it is argued that \"stereotype inconsistent cues might lead to more intentioned thought, thereby suppressing racial priming effects.\" Social psychologists, such as Jennifer Eberhardt, have done work that indicates such priming effects subconsciously help determine attitudes and behavior toward individuals regardless of intentions. These results have been incorporated into training, for example, in some police departments.\n\nIt has been argued that more evidence-based guidance from psychologists and sociologists is needed to learn what is effective in alleviating racism. Such evidence-based approaches can reveal, for example, the many psychological biases to which humans are subject, such as ingroup bias and the fundamental attribution error, which can underlie racist attitudes.\n\nPsychologist Stuart Vyse has argued that argument, ideas, and facts will not mend divisions but that there is evidence, such as that provided by the Robbers Cave Experiment, that seeking shared goals can help alleviate racism.\n\n\n"}

It is currently used by the college's field hockey team for home games, as well as many intramural and club sport contests. There are two fields in the designated \"Busch Field\" area. One is composed of artificial astro turf while the other is artificial field turf. The name for the stadium comes from Anheuser-Busch, formerly the largest American brewer. Anheuser-Busch has a large presence in the Williamsburg area, including a brewery and the theme park Busch Gardens Williamsburg. Adjacent to Busch Field are the Busch Tennis Courts, also sponsored by the company.\n\nBusch Field was, at one time, home to the school's soccer and lacrosse programs before those teams moved to the newly constructed Albert-Daly Field in 2004. The field has two sister stadiums: Coffey Stadium, located in Fairfax, Virginia, and Dragon Stadium, located in Southlake, Texas.\n"}
{"id": "2162858", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2162858", "title": "Sentinel Returns", "text": "Sentinel Returns\n\nSentinel Returns is a video game developed by Hookstone, produced by No-Name Games and published by Sony (under the Psygnosis label) in 1998, for PC and PlayStation. It is the sequel to \"The Sentinel\" by Geoff Crammond and features 651 levels, a multiplayer mode and a soundtrack (titled \"Earth/Air\") composed by John Carpenter and arranged by Gary McKill.\n\nThe PC version has native support limited to a software display mode and an accelerated Glide mode, because in 1998, 3DFX cards were the de facto standard for gaming 3D graphics. However, modern computers can run the game in accelerated mode with the wrappers nGlide, dgVoodoo, OpenGlide or zeckensack's Glide wrapper, which translate Glide calls respectively into Direct3D or OpenGL calls.\n\nThis game looks very different from its predecessor. While in \"The Sentinel\" the levels were bright and colorful, in \"Sentinel Returns\" they are dark and gloomy, with flashes of light being emitted when an object is created or absorbed, and the mouse pointer dynamically lighting the world. The game has a general \"hallucinated\" look: the skies are made out of contrasting streaks of color; the trees are white; the boulders pulsate as if breathing; the sentinels and sentries are hybrids of flesh and metal; the sentinel stands are covered with skin and have four vertebral columns protruding from the corners; the \"specimen\" representing the living part of the synthoid resembles a hydatidiform mole, and it squirms and lets out a shriek when injected with a needle.\n\nControlling Synthoids that are standing at a higher level is fundamental to the game, because only the objects which occupy a visible square can be interacted with (the player may absorb or create objects on a boulder if the sides can be seen). While doing so, the player must watch for the rotation of the Sentinel and be careful not to stand in an area which the Sentinel can see, or else it will start absorbing energy from the Synthoid, and when the energy is gone, the game is over.\n\nHeight is gained by placing a boulder on any visible square, and putting a Synthoid on the boulder. The player may then transfer consciousness to the new Synthoid, and absorb the old one. Stacks of boulders of any height may be created, if the player has enough energy. In order to absorb the Sentinel, the player must create a stack of boulders of sufficient height that the Synthoid on top can look down on the Sentinel's platform. A level is won by absorbing the Sentinel off its platform, creating a new Synthoid in the place of the Sentinel, transferring the consciousness to it and hyperspacing to a new level.\n\nThe number of levels that are skipped between two that are played depends on the amount of energy the player has accumulated when he jumps into hyperspace: absorbing less than 50% of the total energy present in a level will skip a level; absorbing between 50% and 69% will skip two; absorbing between 70% to 89% will skip three; absorbing between 90% and 100% will skip four.\n\nOnce the Sentinel is absorbed, the player may no longer absorb any energy from the landscape, although objects may be created as normal. This enables particularly troublesome levels to be skipped, by returning to a previous level, and finishing it with a different amount of energy than before.\n\nIn later levels, the Sentinel is assisted by a number of \"Sentries\". They behave exactly like the Sentinel, but absorbing them is not necessary to complete the level. Unlike the Sentinel, the Sentries do not stand on a platform but on ordinary squares. The rotation of the Sentinel and the Sentries is slow and predictable. However, if there are many Sentries, there will be few safe locations anywhere on the landscape. If either the Sentinel or the Sentries see a square with more than 1 unit of energy (boulders or a synthoid), their rotation stops while they absorb the energy, one unit at a time. They must be able to see the square on which the energy is located for absorption to take place. Meanwhile, to keep the total energy of the landscape constant, a tree is created randomly on the landscape for each absorbed unit of energy. Thus, in general terms, absorption is simply the transplanting of energy to another location on the game field.\n\nAttention must also be paid to nearby trees: if the Sentinel or Sentry can see a Synthoid or a boulder, but not the square it is standing on, and there are trees in the vicinity, it will transform one of them into a \"Meanie\", which will start rotating. If the player is in a Synthoid when the Meanie turns to face them, and the Meanie can see the square the Synthoid is standing on, it will force the Synthoid to hyperspace and lose 3 units of energy. If the Meanie itself cannot see the player's square after a full rotation, it will turn back into a tree and the Sentinel or Sentry will resume rotation.\n\nIf the player chooses, they may perform a \"Hyperspace\". This will use 3 units of energy to create a new Synthoid at a random location on the playfield. This location is at the same height or lower than the players current height. While performing a hyperspace can be advantageous if the immediate area is fully in the gaze of the Sentinel and/or Sentries, by way of possibly taking you far away from the danger zone, it is generally used as a last resort due to its unpredictable nature. This is because it may take you into a deep ravine from which you may not be able to build up enough boulders to escape from. Also, hyperspacing without the required 3 units of energy (either by player invocation or Meanie) will result in the player losing.\n\nList of objects that can exist in the Sentinel world:\n\n\nAlthough their gameplay is almost identical, the two versions have several differences in their graphical look.\n\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the PlayStation version of the game, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \"Those who have fond memories of the original or who crave a new PlayStation experience should rent before buying. It's definitely an acquired taste.\"\n"}

Crum (1900 – 1959), was a mid-20th-century American lawyer, who became prominent as a member of the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry, his book on that experience, and for defending targets of HUAC, particularly the Hollywood Ten and Paul Robeson.\n\nBartley Cavanaugh Crum was born on November 28, 1900, in Sacramento, California, the son of James Henry Crum and Emma Cavanaugh. He was raised Roman Catholic. In 1922, he received a BA and in 1924 a JD from the University of California at Berkeley.\n\nCrum started his career as a teacher of English and International Law at UC/Berkeley.\n\nIn 1924, Crum joined the law offices of John Francis Neylan, chief attorney for newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst. As a Hearst lawyer, Crum helped defend Clarence Darrow in 1933. \"Darrow taught me more law than I had known before,\" Crum said later.\n\nIn 1934, Neylan, \"along with Bartley Crum, a young associate who functioned as an administrative aide,\" called newspaper publishers together to take a stand against the 1934 West Coast Longshore Strike and accompanying San Francisco General strike. According to ex-Popular Front, liberal journalist Sidney Roger, Neylan was the \"mastermind\" for the shipping industry to break the strikes by convincing Bay area newspapers of a \"Communist plot,\" during which time Crum \"became a strong supporter of the longshore union and Harry Bridges.\"\n\nIn 1938, Crum left Neylan and set up a law office with Philip Ehrlich and David A. Silver. In 1938 or 1939, he joined the National Lawyers Guild as an organization of progressive and Communist lawyers to counter the conservative National Bar Association (NLG), probably at the behest of friend and fellow liberal Republican Robert W. Kenny. In 1939, Crum helped defend Harry Bridges in one of his deportation hearings. He also criticized the US policy during the Spanish Civil War and its aftermath. In 1942, Crum was a vice president of NLG's local chapter. In 1943, Crum served as president of the NLG's San Francisco chapter. In 1943–1944, Crum sponsored American Youth for Democracy.\n\nCrum worked in the 1940 and 1944 campaigns of U.S. presidential candidate Wendell Willkie. In 1941, he became chairman for the Western US of \"Fight for Freedom, Inc.,\" an group favoring intervention in World War II (in alignment with Wilkie).\n\nIn 1943, Crum served as special counsel on FDR's Fair Employment Practices Committee. He also served as WilIke's liaison to FDR via David Niles. When Wilkie failed to get the nomination, Crum helped form \"Independent Republicans for Roosevelt\" and campaigned for FDR, occasionally with Harry S. Truman.\n\nIn October 1944, Crum served as an attorney for Harry Bridges. In November 1944, Crum sent a letter to the Civil Service Commission on behalf of Larry Resner on the subject of loyalty charges.\n\nOn March 18, 1945, Crum signed a statement issued by the National Federation for Constitutional Liberties, advertised in the \"Daily Worker.\" In September 1945, Crum chaired a rally of the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee (JAFRC), which featured an overseas call from Harold Laski. By year end, Crum's clients included Owl Drug, United Drug, and Borden's Milk. He was national vice president of the NLG, national co-chair of the CIO-PAC, and California chair of United China War Relief. Rumor had it that he would succeed Harold L. Ickes as United States Secretary of the Interior.\n\nOn January 1, 1946, Crum accepted an invitation to join the Anglo-American Commission of Inquiry on Palestine (AACIP) that advised President Harry Truman to support the opening of the British Mandate of Palestine to unrestricted Jewish immigration and to ease restrictions on Jewish land purchases. On February 17, 1946, Crum announced in Vienna, Austria, that he expected to see \"mass suicides\" if European Jews did not receive permission to emigrate to Palestine. His book, \"Behind the Silken Curtain a Personal Account of Anglo-American Diplomacy in Palestine and the Middle East\" was published by Simon & Schuster in 1947. \"He charged the British were up to their traditional divide-and-conquer policies.\" When Clifford Clarke succeeded the issue of Israeli independence from David Niles, he received \"advice and assistance\" from Crum, Eliahu Epstein, and Max Lowenthal. Israeli State Archives show that on May 11, 1948, Crum visited President Harry S. Truman: \"Crum [Bartley Crum] saw President yesterday, returned fairly optimistic.\" Crum became chairman of the national council of Americans for Haganah, whose director was David Wahl.\n\nAs vice president of the NLG's state chapter and with Kenny as president, Crum entered into increasing prominent issues involving civil rights of left-leaning people.\n\nIn 1946, Crum answered Paul Robeson in his \"crusade call\" and endorsed the American Crusade Against Lynching (ACAL) organization. The ACAL had been accused of socialist and communist motives; which led to the organization, including Crum, coming under close watch by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The FBI tapped Crum's phones, opened his mail, and shadowed him constantly. In 1946, Crum was a member of the national board of the Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions (ICCASP), which also had a large branch in California, the Hollywood Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions. On July 9, 1946, Crum appeared on a radio program called \"What's On Your Mind About Russia?\" In 1946–1947, Crum was vice chairman and a sponsor of the National Committee to Win the Peace, which joined another group that Crum sponsored called the Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy. At the end of 1946, as ICCASP merged with National Citizens Political Action Committee to form the Progressive Citizens Association (PCA), Crum became the PCA's national vice chairman.\n\nIn 1947, Crum served as attorney for some of the so-called \"Hollywood Ten\" (originally the \"Unfriendly Nineteen\"), subpoenaed to appear before the House Un-American Activities Committee. National Lawyers Guild members formed the core team, originally Charles Katz and Ben Margolis, followed by Crum and Robert W. Kenny, followed by Martin Popper in Washington and Sam Rosenwein in New York.\n\nDuring pre-hearing preparation, the Nineteen and their lawyers negotiated and agreed to a strategy of unanimity as well as a please to cite the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. His daughter recalled: She also recorded differences between Communist and non-Communist lawyers (in which latter camp Crum was), contrary to other accounts of greater unity among lawyers.\n\nIn 1948, due to blowback from the HUAC Hollywood hearings, Crum moved his family from the San Francisco Bay area to New York City.\n\nIn 1948, Crum's name appeared as a member of the board of directors of the California Labor School, listed as a subversive organization by US Attorney General Tom C. Clark in December 1947 on the AGLOSO.\n\nIn May 1948, Joseph Starobin, foreign news editor of the \"Daily Worker\", referred in print to Crum's \"unquestionably progressive career.\" In early June 1948, Crum appeared before the American Russian Instititute and expressed his \"Soviet sympathy\" (according to the FBI)> In June 1948, Crum bought a major interest in the dying \"PM\" newspaper with Joseph Fels Barnes from Marshall Field III, who maintained a minority interest. On June 23, 1948, they renamed \"PM\" as the \"New York Star\". Also in the 1948 United States presidential election, he supported Harry S. Truman (Democrat) over Thomas E. Dewey (Republican) or Henry A. Wallace (Progressive).\n\nIn January 1949, the \"Star\" folded (and helped undermine Crum's personal finances). During that year, Crum joined Hays, Podell, Algase, Crum & Feuer with offices at 39 Broadway.\n\nIn 1950, Crum's name came up in Congress during investigation into Truman crony Max Lowenthal. On September 15, 1950, Lowenthal appeared before the House Un-American Activities Committee AKA \"HUAC\" (two of whose members were Mundt and Nixon–of the Mundt-Nixon Bill). Already in August 1950, HUAC had re-subpoenaed four witness who had been part of Whittaker Chambers's Ware Group: Lee Pressman, Nathan Witt, Charles Kramer and John Abt. The committee had asked both Pressman and Kramer whether they knew Lowenthal; both confirmed. Lowenthal brought former U.S. Senator Burton K. Wheeler as counsel. After reviewing his curriculum vitae, the committee tried to link him with known Communist Party members and organizations, some of which he confirmed, others not, all without admitting any wrongdoing. Names mentioned included: Crum, Alger Hiss, Donald Hiss, David Wahl, Martin Popper, Allan Rosenberg, Lee Pressman, the Russian-American Industrial Corporation, the Twentieth Century Fund, and the International Juridical Association.\n\nIn the 1952 United States presidential election, Crum supported Adlai E. Stevenson (Democrat) over Dwight D. Eisenhower (Republican).\n\nIn 1953, syndicated columnist Westbrook Pegler wrote of Crum: \n\nIn 1958, Crum became involved in a controversy with Jimmy Hoffa, head of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (\"Teamsters\"). He had been trying to collect $210,000 in legal fees from the Teamsters for a client (lawyers represented by Godfrey P. Schmidt). He testified in before the United States Select Committee on Improper Activities in the Labor or Management Field.\n\nIn 1947 (prior to the HUAC hearings), Crum first took a combination of alcohol and barbiturates, from which he was revived. In the early hours of February 9, 1949, a few days after the \"New York Star\" folded, Crum made a second suicide attempt, again with pills and alcohol. Doctors who treated him included Gregory Zilboorg, a psychiatrist who also treated Lillian Hellman.\n\nBy the late 1950s, long labeled a subversive, Crum had lost most of his clients. Unable to cope with stress from the harassment, he successfully committed suicide on December 9, 1959, by washing down an entire bottle of seconal with whisky. His wife discovered his body at their home at 165 East Eightieth Street, New York City.\n\nCrum married Anna Gertrude Bosworth, an author of novels and (later) a cookbook. They had two children. The younger, son Bartley Crum, Jr., committed suicide in 1953 by shooting himself with his grandfather's gun in his freshman year at Reed College. The older, daughter Patricia Bosworth, became first a successful actress and then even more successful writer. In 1997, she wrote a family memoir, \"Anything Your Little Heart Desires\", reminiscing about her father. In 2017, she wrote a second memoir about her father, brother, and husbands, called \"The Men in My Life: Love and Art in 1950s Manhattan\". She died from complications of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn 1941, Crum moved his family from Berkeley to 763 Bay Street, San Francisco. In 1945, they moved again to 2626 Green Street, San Francisco. In 1948, they moved to New York City, where they lived at several addresses.\n\nIn their obituary of Crum in 1959, the \"New York Times\" quoted Crum's stance on outlawing the CPUSA: Assessing his daughter's 1997 memoir, the \"New York Times\" wrote that she remembered him as: She also admitted, \"My father informed on two colleagues already known to be Communists.\"\n\nIn 1978, during an interview regarding who came up with the idea of arguing the First over Fifth Amendment in October 1947, Carey McWilliams said: As of late 1999, Boston University houses many of Crum's papers in the archive of his daughter.\n\nIn 2014, Larry Ceplair and Christopher Trumbo (son of Dalton Trumbo) criticized the portrait of Crum by daughter Patricia Bosworth in her memoir \"Anything Your Little Heart Desires\" over the issue of \"unanimity\" demanded among the Nineteen and their lawyers. They argue that Crum must have known about their strategy of unanimity, whereas Bosworth claimed he only learned later. Crum was no \"innocent dupe,\" nor was his client Dmytryk. They support their critique by citing Crum's long-term membership in the National Lawyers Guild, with its strong Communist partisans.\n\nCrum's book was the \"President's favorite\" (referring to Truman). Albert Kahn of the \"Worker\" also endorsed the book, as did the \"New Masses\" and American Youth for Democracy.\n\n\n\n"}

After the fall of that prince in 1811, Christopoulos was employed by John Caradja, who had been appointed \"hospodar\" of Walachia, in drawing up a code of laws for that country.\n\nOn the removal of Caradja, Christopoulos retired into private life and devoted himself to literature promoting the Demotiki (of the people) form of Greek language. He wrote drinking songs and love ditties which were very popular among the Greeks. He is also the author of a tragedy, of \"Politika Parallela\" (a comparison of various systems of government), of translations of Homer and Heraclitus, and of some philological works on the connection between ancient and modern Greek.\n\nHis \"Hellenika Archaiologemata\" (Athens, 1853) contains an account of his life.

He was ordained priest in 1540, and in 1552 was appointed master of the grammar school of Linlithgow, from which town he was later \"expellit and schott out\" by the partisans of Dean Patrick Kinlochy, \"preacher\" there. He had also enjoyed the office of Provost of the Collegiate Church of St Michael in that town. He retired to Edinburgh, where the return of Mary, Queen of Scots, from France had given heart to the Catholics.\n\nThere he took part in the pamphlet war which then raged, and entered into conflict with John Knox and other leading reformers. He appears to have acted for a time as confessor to the queen. In July 1562, when engaged in the printing of his \"Last Blast\", he narrowly escaped the vengeance of his opponents, who had by that time gained the upper hand in the capital, and he fled, on 3 September, with the nuncio Gouda to Leuven.\n\nHe reached Paris in 1565 and became a member of the \"German Nation\" of the university. At Queen Mary's request he joined Bishop Leslie on his embassy to Queen Elizabeth I in 1571, and remained with the bishop after his removal by Elizabeth's orders to ward at Fenny Staunton, Huntingdonshire.\n\nWhen further suspicion fell on Leslie and he was committed to the Tower, Winzet was permitted to return to Paris. There he continued his studies, and in 1574 left for Douai, where in the following year he became a licentiate. He was in residence at Rome from 1575 to 1577, and was then appointed by Pope Gregory XIII abbot of the Benedictine monastery of St James, Regensburg. There he died on 21 September 1592.\n\nWinzet's works are almost entirely controversial. He justified his literary activity on the side of Catholicism on the double plea of conscience and the inability of the bishops and theologians to supply the necessary arguments (hies' Tractate, ed. STS, i. p. so). \"We may nawayis langer contene vs,\" he writes, \"hot expresse on al sydis as we think, referring Jur iugement to the haly Catholik Kirk.\"\n\nIn his first work, \"Certaine Tractates\" (three in number), printed in 1562, he rates his fellow clergy for negligence and sin, invites replies from Knox regarding his authority as minister and his share in the new ecclesiastical constitution, and protests against the interference with Catholic burgesses by the magistrates of Edinburgh. The \"Last Blast\", which was interrupted in publication, is an onslaught on heretics and a falsely ordained clergy.\n\nIn his \"Bake of Four Scoir Thee Questions\" (1563), addressed to the \"Calviniane Precheouris,\" in which he treats of church doctrine, sacraments, priesthood, obedience to rulers, free-will and other matters, he is dogmatic rather than polemical. He translated the \"Commonitorium\" of Vincentius Lirinensis (1563), and wrote, in Latin, a \"Flagellum sectarionum\" and a \"Velitatio in Georgium Buchananum\" (1582).\n\nWinzet's vernacular writings have been edited by J. Hewison for the Scottish Text Society (2 vols, 1888, 1890). The Tractates were printed, with a preface by David Laing, by the Maitland Club (1835).\n\n"}

He currently hosts \"Brick at Night With JT the Brick\" on Sirius XM Satellite Radio's Mad Dog Sports Radio. He previous hosted a show that aired weekdays from 5pm to 8pm Pacific time (8pm to 11pm Eastern) on Fox Sports Radio. Fox Sports announced on Sept. 11, 2018 that Tournour and producer Steve Gorman were let go by the network. Tournour is a graduate of SUNY Geneseo.\n\nTournour, a former stockbroker, got his start in sports radio after becoming a frequent caller to \"The Jim Rome Show\". After winning the inaugural \"Smack-Off\" in 1995, Tournour was offered a job hosting a late-night Sunday show at KMAX-Los Angeles.\n\nFrom there, Tournour moved his show to KFMB-San Diego, where he only spent a few weeks before being offered a show on the now-defunct Las Vegas-based Sports Fan Radio Network. Tournour's late-night show lasted five years, until the network's demise in 2001. While working in Las Vegas, he called the very first game of the original XFL featuring the Las Vegas Outlaws over local radio. During this time, he also hosted an afternoon show on San Francisco-based radio station KNBR. At one time, KNBR had Tournour for his local show, his four-hour national show, and an overnight replay of at least a portion of that national show before the next broadcast day began.\n\nIn June 2001, Tournour landed at the upstart Fox Sports Radio, hosting an afternoon show. He was later moved to the evening, hosting a late-night syndicated sports show on SportsFan Radio Network. The show was shifted to 3 pm Pacific, 6 pm Eastern, in 2012.\n\nTournour also hosted, until the end of the 2005 season, a Sunday night show, \"Fox Sunday Game Time React\", where he discussed the football games of the day with Bryan Cox.

{"id": "2162909", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2162909", "title": "Kentucky Educational Television", "text": "Kentucky Educational Television\n\nKentucky Educational Television (branded on-air as KET: The Kentucky Network or simply KET) is a state network of PBS member television stations serving the U.S. Commonwealth of Kentucky. It is operated by the Kentucky Authority for Educational Television, an agency of the Kentucky state government which holds the licenses for almost all of the PBS member stations licensed in the state with the exception of WKYU-TV (channel 24) in Bowling Green. KET is the largest PBS state network in the United States; the broadcast signals of its sixteen stations cover almost all of the state, as well as parts of Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia.\n\nThe network's offices, network center and primary studio facilities are located at the O. Leonard Press Telecommunications Center on Cooper Drive in Lexington, adjacent to the campus of the University of Kentucky (KET has no other direct affiliation with the university). KET also has production centers in Louisville as well as at the Kentucky State Capitol Annex in Frankfort. KET carries national programming from PBS and American Public Television along with a wide range of local programming, basic skills and workplace education.\n\nKET was founded by O. Leonard Press, a member of the University of Kentucky faculty, who was a pioneer in educational broadcasting. Before coming to the university, Press had developed the weekly broadcast from the National Press Club, which has aired for over half a century. In the mid-1950s, he taped a popular anthropology course, and the response to the telecourses was positive enough for Press and two of his colleagues to consider founding an educational television station at UK. This was a natural choice given UK's history in educational broadcasting. UK had been involved in broadcasting in one form or another since 1921, and operated WBKY (now WUKY), the nation's oldest educational radio station on the FM dial.\n\nThis drive failed, but Press and his colleagues decided to set their sights higher and make a bid for a statewide educational television network along the lines of Alabama Educational Television (now Alabama Public Television). At the time, the only educational station in Kentucky was WFPK-TV (channel 15, now KET outlet WKPC-TV) in Louisville, which signed on the air on September 8, 1958. Before KET signed on, the only other areas of Kentucky that received a clear signal from an educational television station were Northern Kentucky (from WCET in Cincinnati), the Jackson Purchase (from WSIU-TV in Carbondale, Illinois), and certain areas of South Central Kentucky near the Tennessee state line (from WDCN, now WNPT, in Nashville, Tennessee).\n\nThe idea gained little momentum until 1959, when Press addressed the local Rotary Club in the state capital of Frankfort and a story about it appeared in \"The Courier-Journal\" newspaper. After landing support from UK officials, what was supposed to be a short meeting with Governor Bert T. Combs turned into a proposal to start the state network. The Kentucky Authority for Educational Television was created in 1962 with Press serving as its executive director.\n\nThe project made little progress until 1965 when Ashland Oil founder Paul G. Blazer personally acquired the first thirteen transmitter sites and then gifted the sites to the authority. Ownership of the sites led to KET's expanded inclusion in the state budget and eligibility for HEW and Appalachian Regional Commission grants.\n\nKET finally went on the air for the first time on September 23, 1968 at 3 p.m. Eastern Time (2 p.m. Central Time). The first broadcast started with Governor Louie B. Nunn speaking at the network's dedication ceremony that marked the network's first day on the air. Nunn himself pressed the button to officially put the network on the air. The ten charter stations of the network were flagship station WKLE/Lexington, along with WKAS/Ashland, WKGB-TV/Bowling Green, WKZT-TV/Elizabethtown, WKHA/Hazard, WKMA-TV/Madisonville, WKMR/Morehead, WKON/Owenton, WKPI-TV/Pikeville, and WKSO-TV/Somerset. Over the next 13 years after the network's sign-on, five more full-power stations were added to the network:\n\nBefore joining PBS in 1970, KET was a member of its predecessor, National Educational Television, for its first two years of operation, broadcasting some of that network's programs. The first instructional television (ITV) program produced by KET was \"Kentucky is My Land\", which premiered in 1969. Originally operating only during school hours, within a year it had acquired enough support to begin broadcasting its programming during the evening as well. By 1975, it was showing programming seven days a week. The network began nightly coverage of the Kentucky General Assembly in 1978.\n\nIn 1982, KET Enterprises is created as a syndication arm of KET to develop, acquire and distribute educational programs nationally to and from other PBS affiliated networks.\n\nFrom 1988 through the 1990s and early 2000s, KET's Star Channels satellite network brought hundreds of hours of instructional programming and professional development seminars to schools all over Kentucky. The Star Channels received the national Innovations Award from the Ford Foundation in 1991.\nKET Star Channels 703 and 704 were eventually converted into satellite-exclusive television channels that were entirely different from the over-the-air KET schedule, similar to those of KET3 and KET4 when they were launched in the early 2000s. Star Channels 703 and 704 were also available to Ku-band free-to-air satellite television users.\n\nOn May 30, 1997, the Kentucky Authority for Educational Television acquired the license for Louisville's then-standalone WKPC-TV from locally based Fifteen Telecommunications, Inc. The FCC approved the sale three days later, on June 2. KET's statewide schedule moved to WKPC from the network's original station, WKMJ-TV on July 1. WKMJ went silent on that day for an upgrade on its transmitter. Its August 1997 return to the air marked the launch of KET's second service, KET2, which was intentionally made to be tailored to the Louisville metropolitan area.\n\nWKPC-TV's digital signal, WKPC-DT, was the first KET affiliate to broadcast in digital, and Kentucky's first digital television station. On August 19, 1999, that station's digital signal was turned on by then-Kentucky governor Paul E. Patton as part of the opening day festivities of the Kentucky State Fair.\n\n\nIn 1987, KET, along with Detroit, Michigan ABC affiliate WXYZ-TV, produced \"Learn to Read\", an adult educational program that teaches reading skills and it was hosted by entrepreneur and literacy advocate Wally Amos. Amos was also the host of another KET-produced adult literacy program, \"Another Page\".\n\nPrior to 2002, KET went off the air every night at midnight E.T. (11 p.m. CT). The network used to sign off with the playing of \"My Old Kentucky Home\", which is the official state song of Kentucky. The film featured scenes from all areas of Kentucky, including Fort Boonesborough, the Jefferson Davis Monument, the Lincoln Birthplace, Kentucky Horse Park, and more.\n\nKET, available to all cable subscribers in Kentucky, broadcasts locally produced cultural and public information programs about the state, programs produced by independent Kentucky filmmakers, prime time programming from PBS, PBS Kids series, and GED, how-to and adult education programs.\n\nAs it is one of a few PBS member state networks encompassing two time zones, KET's programming operates on an Eastern Time Zone schedule; in promos, online guides on the network's website and print advertisements, airtimes within the Central Time Zone (which covers the western part of the state) are identified secondarily, in the manner of the \"Eastern/Central\" scheduling references used by many national broadcast and cable networks. Most of the KET stations have callsigns beginning with \"WK\", with the exception of Covington-licensed WCVN-TV.\n\nLouisville's WKPC and WKMJ are the only KET stations whose transmitters are located outside of Kentucky – both stations' transmitters are located at the Kentuckiana Tower Farm in rural Floyd County, Indiana (north of Floyds Knobs and New Albany). Because of its location and signal strength (according to FCC data), WKPC and WKMJ cover more of the Indiana side of the Louisville market than the Kentucky side. In addition to the reach of WKPC and WKMJ, several of KET's other stations are viewed in significant portions of Kentucky's neighboring states as well.\n\nKET also operates three translator stations:\nKET also previously utilized analog transmitters that were shut down before the digital TV translation. They were:\nIn Augusta, W20CT-D was launched in October 2007 as the companion for W56AT. W28DD-D was the digital companion for W10AR in Louisa. Falmouth's W23DM-D was the digital companion for W56AM.\n\nKET2, based on KET's original Louisville station, WKMJ-TV, airs the national PBS schedule, local programming including shows focused on the Louisville area, children's programs, how-to series, documentaries and public affairs programs. Outside of Louisville, KET2 can be seen on several cable systems across Kentucky as well as on KET's digital signals. It is broadcast in standard definition and is available to 62% of Kentucky's cable subscribers. Originally, WKMJ-TV was the KET translator serving the Louisville market alongside of the independent WKPC-TV; it carried the same programs as in the rest of the state.\n\nKET KY, formerly branded as KET3, which is carried as the third digital subchannel on 15 of the KET stations and on WKMJ-DT2, formerly broadcast all of the state network's educational programming throughout its broadcast day. In January 2008, KET3 was relaunched as KET KY, now broadcasting Kentucky-based issues, heritage, history and culture. The network's educational programming was moved to KET ED in late 2007.\n\nKET KY also broadcasts coverage of the Kentucky General Assembly while it is in session, combining the services previously offered on KET5 and KET6. KET KY presently broadcasts 24 hours a day in standard definition. KET KY also previously broadcast KET HD programming from 8 p.m. to 12 midnight Eastern (7-11 p.m. Central) until Fall 2009.\n\nOn December 12, 2016, the fourth subchannel of KET's main satellites were relaunched for the first time since the discontinuation of KET ED, the Educational Channel seven years prior. It was first broadcasting a test pattern. Since January 12, 2017, the DT4 subchannel of all of the KET stations except WKMJ now carries the new 24-hour-a-day PBS Kids channel, with the branding KET Kids. It provides a 24/7 schedule of children's programming. However, both KET and KET2 continue to provide a limited block of PBS Kids programming. It became available to Kentucky's cable providers in March 2017.\n\nKET World features programs about world history, featuring programming content sourced from the World network; it is currently available only on the third digital subchannel of KET's secondary Louisville station WKMJ-TV.\n\nKET ED (formerly branded as \"KET4\"), formerly offered KET's digital service during primetime hours and programming from the Annenberg Channel at other times. At one time, this service was carried on the fourth digital subchannel of KET's station. From 2007 to 2009, it was re-branded as KET ED, the Education Channel. During that time, professional development and instructional programming, and Annenberg programming was provided 20 hours per day from 12 midnight to 8 p.m. Eastern time (11 p.m. to 7 p.m. Central time), which was previously on KET3 and on Star Channels 703 and 704. In Louisville, this service was also available 24 hours a day on WKMJ's DT3 digital signal, but has since been discontinued in 2009, due to an increase of fees for the usage of the national PBSHD channel by PBS. Instead, KET reinvested the money to acquire new digital equipment, including upgrades to allow the transmission of locally produced and tape delayed programming in high definition. This increase of PBSHD fees has also led to KET scheduling HD programming themselves, rather than merely carrying the national feed on the KET KY channel.\n\nBeginning in the fall of 2009, KET ED provided a feed of K-12 educational programming on KET KY from 1:00 to 5:00 a.m. Eastern Time. The KET ED programming block on KET KY was ultimately discontinued in the early 2010s, but the KET ED service remains available as an on-demand video service on KET's website.\n\nKET5 and KET6 featured live coverage of the Kentucky House of Representatives and Senate respectively on the services, while the state General Assembly was in session. These channels were discontinued in January 2008, when KET realigned its digital programming (see KET KY and KET ED above). As mentioned above, coverage of the General Assembly, while reduced significantly, is still carried on KET KY. In the state capital of Frankfort, however, both the Kentucky House and Senate are seen when in session on local cable provider Frankfort Plant Board, overlapping the slots of C-SPAN3 and NASA TV.\n\nIn addition to KET's statewide cable television availability, some cable providers along state lines can cover certain areas on both sides of the state lines because of their interstate customer base.\n\nOn DirecTV and Dish Network, certain KET stations are also available in the Kentucky-associated media markets in their entireties. WKPD, WKOH, WKPC, WCVN, and WKAS are carried on the respective local feeds in the Paducah/Cape Girardeau, Evansville, Louisville, Cincinnati, and Huntington/Charleston markets. KET2, through WKMJ-TV, is currently available on both satellite providers in the Louisville market only. Currently, in the Bowling Green market, only Dish Network carries the network via WKGB as DirecTV does not provide local channels to that market.\n\nThe digital channels of most of KET's stations are multiplexed:\nWKMJ's digital channel uses a different multiplexed lineup from the other fifteen KET stations:\nAlthough the DTV Delay Act extended the mandatory deadline from February 17 to June 12, 2009, KET shut down the analog signals of all 16 Stations on April 16, 2009.\n\nEach stations' post-transition digital allocations are as follows:\n\n\nKET began broadcasting in high definition from its new high definition production facility in Lexington on October 1, 2009.\n\nOn January 29, 2014, the United States Department of Agriculture awarded KET a grant worth $357,700, as part of its Public Television Digital Transition Grant program, to upgrade 20 analog microwave relays for WKSO, WKMR, WKHA and WKPI to digital, in order to provide digital television service to rural areas of Kentucky.\n\nKET, among its many educational programs, runs a Distance Learning program. The program features Latin, Humanities, Physics and German language course offerings and offers leveled courses ranging from introductory to advanced placement classes. It's offered primarily for Kentucky high school students for whom it's offered tuition-free. However, out-of-state schools may enroll students in the course for a small tuition fee.\n\nThe aim of the program is to provide a full course in the aforementioned subjects for schools who don't offer a particular class. Often schools seek distance learning as a temporary solution in cases of funding cuts, which lead to dismissal of teachers or discontinuation of the teaching of certain subjects altogether. The program also is popular with parents of home-schooled children.\n\nThe program was established in 1989; the direct-to-school model became possible after a substantial expansion of the state network's headquarters (now dubbed \"The O. Leonard Press Telecommunications Center\") and legislative funding to provide a satellite receiver for every school and public library in the state. The course was originally administered and taught via live satellite broadcasts directly into classrooms with two-way keypads for real-time student-teacher interaction. Homework, tests, quizzes and other material were distributed by modem and mail.\n\nSince the mid-1990s, KET's Distance Learning program has migrated from broadcast lessons to instruction via KET's website and multimedia lessons on videotape, CD and DVD.\n\nIn 2017, it was reported that KET receives approximately $3.4 million annually from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which amounts to about $0.78 per Kentuckian. Other sources of funding outside of grants include those raised by the Friends of KET (established in 1971), the KET Fund for Excellence (since 1981) and the Commonwealth Fund for KET (since 1995), as well as their annual Telethons, which typically airs in late February/early March since 1974.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2162918", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2162918", "title": "The Jim Rome Show", "text": "The Jim Rome Show\n\nThe Jim Rome Show is a sports radio talk show hosted by Jim Rome. It airs live for three hours each weekday from 9 a.m. to noon Pacific Time. The show is produced in Los Angeles, syndicated by CBS Sports Radio, and can be heard on affiliate radio stations in the U.S. and Canada. In January 2018, the show began simulcasting on television on CBS Sports Network.\n\n\"The Jim Rome Show\" began on XTRA Sports 690 in San Diego. In 1996, Premiere Radio Networks picked up the program for national syndication. Sometime after, the show was shortened by one hour and the broadcast location was shifted from XTRA Sports 690 to the Premiere Radio Networks studio complex in Sherman Oaks, California. As part of the broadcast deal bringing Rome's TV show to CBS Sports Network, \"The Jim Rome Show\" became a charter program of CBS Sports Radio upon its full launch on January 2, 2013.\n\n\n\nThe three-hour program is a mixture of interviews, calls, emails, Tweets and Rome's own thoughts and analysis. The opening and closing theme is \"Lust for Life\" by Iggy Pop, and the show also uses \"Welcome to the Jungle\" by Guns N' Roses The program usually begins with headlines, when Rome highlights the main sports news of the day with his thoughts and opinions. Rome refers to his listeners as \"Clones\".\n\nOne of the main parts of the program is Rome reading emails and Tweets on air. He usually comments positively or negatively depending on the message. Ones he does not like are crumpled and thrown in the garbage. Many emails and Tweets are \"smack talk\", where the messenger is putting down someone in sports, pop culture, or even other listeners. \n\nRome takes calls and ask callers to call in, though many times he does not take any of the calls at all. Rome's rules for calls is \"have a take, don't suck.\" Calls that are good in his opinion will be racked, which means they will be saved for future use. Bad calls get buzzed and cut off, followed usually by humiliation from Rome. Some calls get neither and usually will be followed by brief analysis or thoughts by Rome.\n\nThe final segments of the show usually include e-mail and Twitter contests. Sometimes these contests include gift cards from one of Rome's sponsors, O'Reilly Auto Parts.\n\nFriday episodes include the week rewind, known as \"Alvin Delloro's Week that Was\", which is a compilation of show highlights over the past week alongside a mix of music.\n\nFrom February 11 to March 11, 2009, all of Rome's shows contained an interview with an individual with the given name Rex.\n\nThe Smack-Off is an annual competition on the show. It differs from every other show during the year in that there are no scheduled guests or takes from Rome. The entire show features the best callers on the show and serves as a way of determining the best caller in a given year. The event is invite only. \n\nCallers may qualify in a number of ways: \n\nHowever, making a bad call could lose someone their invitation. Also, receiving an invite does not guarantee the caller will be able to get on the air. \n\nThe Smack-Off is known as the most important day of the year in The Jungle. It is typically held in spring or early summer and is always on a Friday. It has been held annually since 1995. In addition to receiving the prestige of being the best caller in that given year, recent winners have also received a prize package. The 2015 and 2016 winner received a $5,000 grand prize. \n\nWhile receiving input from the listeners, the winner is picked solely by the XR4TI and is announced in the last segment of the show. There is no strict time limit, but Rome will run a caller if they start rambling too long. The winning criteria is subjective, as there are no set rules or criteria. However, the winning call is typically the person who comes up with some original smack for the other top callers, mixes in some sports takes, and brings something new to the event.\n\nIn 2010, as a complement to his annual show entitled The Smack-Off (which features the best callers on the show), Rome instituted The Hack-Off (which features the worst callers on the show). It was typically held a week before The Smack-Off, with the winner earning an automatic entry into that event. It was initially referred to as the \"Eddie in Boise Invitational\". Some of the more popular callers included Vinnie Mac, Matt in Cleveland (aka Tarzan), Eddie in Boise, Ryan in Wichita, Ray Ray in Tampa, Jolene in Farmington, and Jason (the star-linebacker) in Ottawa. It is still unclear if the winner of the event was the \"worst of the worst\" or the \"best of the worst\". Much to everyone's disappointment, Rome decided to cancel the Hack-off after the 2013 event. Despite the efforts of numerous clones, Rome has maintained his stance that the event will not return.\n\nPast Winners:\n\n\nAt length he announces when he is going to be \"in the basement\" (on vacation) and for how long. He justifies his frequent absences to the Clones by proclaiming, \"I take a lot of vacation because I get a lot of vacation\" (a parody of a comment made by Patrick Ewing during the 1998 NBA lockout). To ensure live content on days when Rome is absent, \"The Jim Rome Show\" is hosted by a rotating stable of guest hosts, including:\n\nFormer guest hosts of the show include:\n\nOn holidays, the show airs \"The Best of the Jim Rome Show\", a retrospective episode of memorable interviews and segments.\n\nSince its inception, \"The Jim Rome Show\" has always been offered on terrestrial radio, and has not been offered on satellite radio. The show is, however, offered on streaming and podcast through the official web site. On May 6, 2003, Rome made a return to television with \"Jim Rome Is Burning\" on ESPN, and occasionally hinted about switching the radio program to satellite, or abandoning the radio program altogether, in favor of television full-time.\n\nRome is often quite vocal about his frequent displeasures with affiliates, specifically those who do not carry the entire three hours, air the show on tape delay, or frequently pre-empt the broadcast. Rome has openly admitted that he is intrigued by the idea of satellite radio and broadcasting the program free of affiliates' interference. However, he is also aware of some listeners' problems with paying for satellite radio, and has received numerous phone calls and e-mails from terrestrial radio listeners who have said that the humor of the show has brought them through difficult times or keeps them entertained at work.\n\nOn April 27, 2006, Rome stated that he will keep the radio program going, but initially made no commitment to satellite or terrestrial. On July 11, 2006, Rome announced that he signed a multi-year deal with Premiere Radio Networks to keep the show on terrestrial radio. In addition, he stated that the show may be simulcast on satellite radio in the future. Clear Channel provides content exclusively to XM Satellite Radio, including the entire Fox Sports Radio network.\n\nIn January 2013, the show moved to the CBS Sports Radio network. In October 2017, CBS Sports Network announced that it would add a simulcast of \"The Jim Rome Show\" to its afternoon lineup beginning January 2, 2018.\n\n\n"}

During his career he is best known for his appearances with Nottingham Forest, Derby Country and Aston Villa and was capped twice for England. Charles was most recently the manager of Nuneaton Town.\n\nBorn in Newham, London, Charles started his career at Clapton F.C., but first came into notability at Nottingham Forest, when he became a regular alongside Roy Keane, making his debut on 7 November 1987. Due to his colour and skills, he was dubbed \"the Brazilian\". His manager at Nottingham, Brian Clough, commented on his dribbling abilities by saying: \"When Charles plays a one-two, he goes like a gazelle. It's so effortless - at first it looks as if he's not moving, yet he's 40 yards up the field.\" In June 1991, he made his debut for England, playing two friendlies, against New Zealand on 8 June and Malaysia on 12 June. Only a few days earlier, Charles was famously fouled by Paul Gascoigne in the 1991 FA Cup Final. This was the challenge that caused Gascoigne's cruciate ligaments to tear, forcing him out of the game for several months. On 29 March 1992, he made the squad that won the Full Members Cup against Southampton.\n\nOn 29 July 1993, he made a £750,000 move to Derby County, appearing 76 times for them during a two-year spell, which included honours for PFA Team of the Year in 1993–94. On 6 January 1995, he signed with Aston Villa for a fee close to £1.4m, and assumed a regular starting role, although he was frequently injured, being out for two seasons recovering from a serious ankle injury. He appeared in 80 league matches in three and half years with the Villans, winning one League Cup. On 14 January 1999, Charles moved abroad, joining Benfica in Portugal, for a fee of £1m. He was the back-up choice after the failed bid for Oleh Luzhny. However, in Portugal, his problem with injuries remained; on 22 January, just six days after arriving, he sustained a sprain in his right hock with rupture of the joint capsule of his knee, being sidelined for two months. He finally made his debut on a 3-0 home loss against Boavista on 14 March 1999, and played in three more games, scoring one goal, before being sidelined again on late April, due to a pubalgia. \nSpending the entire summer recovering from injury, he was put on the transfer list by Jupp Heynckes, so he made a move to his boyhood team West Ham United on 5 October 1999 for £1.2m. During the three seasons with the Hammers, he was constantly out by injuries so he opted to end his professional career on 29 July 2002.\n\nIn October 2011, Charles joined Lincoln City as Assistant Manager alongside manager David Holdsworth, but has since became the Director of Football at the University of Nottingham. On 29 March 2018 it was announced that he had accepted the manager's position at National League North side Nuneaton Town. In June 2018, he was replaced as manager at Nuneaton by Nicky Eaden.\n\nAfter the end of his playing career, Charles struggled with alcoholism. He however overcame these difficulties and has attained his UEFA A Coaching licence. In 2018, Charles was reported as being a recovering alcoholic with a business providing care to people who are experiencing depression and alcohol and drug dependency.\n\nNottingham Forest\n\nAston Villa\n"}

He left school at age 14 to enter into newspaper businesses as a teenager. He worked in Glasgow and on Fleet Street. When World War II broke out, Webster joined the British Army and rose to the rank of major, with most of his six years' service spent in the Middle East.\n\nAfter the war, Webster emigrated to Canada. He covered the labour beat for the \"Vancouver Sun\" newspaper. In 1953, he began to work on commercial radio in the talk radio format, which had its origins in British Columbia before it spread to the United States. Webster made his mark broadcasting shorthand transcripts of testimony during a probe into corruption on Vancouver's police force. His City Mike show on CJOR achieved some fame covering the issue.\n\nHe left CJOR and moved his show to CKNW. In the 1960s, he had 186,000 daily listeners and a $100,000 salary. In 1963, prisoners at the BC Penitentiary were foiled in an escape attempt and took hostages. At the prisoners' request, Webster acted as a mediator between hostage-holding prisoners and the authorities and helped resolve the stand-off.\n\nIn 1972, Jim Pattison lured Webster back to CJOR. Then in 1979, at the age of 60, Webster moved his radio show to television, where his familiar expression '9 am prrre-cisely' became his trademark. His hour-long TV interview program \"Webster!\", which was seen weekdays at 9 am on BCTV and then-sister CHEK-TV and from 1986, at 5pm proceeding the nightly news hour on BCTV, frequently dealt with British Columbia politics. Shortly after the final BCTV show aired in April 1987, Webster and the TV station donated the videos for all nine years of his shows to the BC Archives.\n\nIn 1990, Webster joined the long-running CBC TV program Front Page Challenge as its permanent fourth panelist until the show's cancellation in 1995.\n\nIn 1987, he was inducted into the Canadian News Hall of Fame.\nIn 1988, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada.\nIn 2017, the 150th anniversary of Canada, Webster was profiled in Vancouver newspapers as one of the most notable 150 British Columbians.\n\nIn 1986, more than 1000 people attended a salute to Webster upon his retirement. This event resulted in the creation of the Jack Webster Foundation to promote and honour excellence in journalism in British Columbia. Each year, journalists judged to have outstanding work receive a Jack Webster Award (known as a \"Webster\"), a glass statue and a cash prize that has become the hallmark of journalistic excellence in British Columbia.\n\nThe awards have grown from a single \"Reporter of the Year\" in 1987 to thirteen awards today for best news, best feature and best community news reporting (print, radio, and TV awards in each of the three categories) as well as recognition for excellence in the categories of business reporting, science reporting, commentary, legal journalism, Chinese-language news, and the Bruce Hutchison Lifetime Achievement Award. The Foundation also awards fellowships and six annual student reporting awards.\n\n\n"}

Most south Indians add ripe banana as well. Panchamrita is an Ayurvedic preparation but has been manipulated in several places to cut costs and increase keeping value.\n\nSome people use sugar instead of jaggery, which is not accepted by all, as sugar is not a natural element like jaggery and sugar is sometimes refined using bone charcoal which makes it inappropriate to use for pooja.\n\nIn Palani Murugan temple, Tamil Nadu, panchamrita consists of banana, sugar, ghee, honey, seedless dates, cardamom and sugar candy.

Two of his CDs \"One Day Deep\" and \"Pyramid in Your Backyard\" have won many awards and worldwide recognition. \"Sigh\", included in the \"One Day Deep\" CD and as a single, had stayed in the Billboards for over 70 weeks.\n\nPraful's songs show a wide variety of rhythm and roots. On \"One Day Deep\", \"Sonhar\" features a fast Indian dance rhythm. On the same CD, \"Let the Chips Fall\" reveals a relaxing acid jazz rhythm. He lives near Amsterdam, the Netherlands.\n\nAs a young child he learned the recorder, flute and electronic organ. Frustrated when his mother would not let him carry the electronic organ with him to gigs around town he vowed never to play the instrument again, instead switching to piano and synthesizers. He switched to the saxophone at age 18. His first bands were\n\nAfter school he traveled the world for a year, returning with a broadened horizon and the determination to make music the center of his life and creative expression.\n\nIn 1987 he moved to the Netherlands to study jazz saxophone and flute at the Amsterdam School of Arts (Hilversum Conservatory, now AHK). There he was taught by Ferdinand Povel, Friederike Darius and Rob Madna.\n\nDuring his time as a student at the conservatory Praful was involved in several bands including:\n\nAfter receiving his Conservatory degree in 1992 he spent 6 months in India in the Ashram of the enlightened teacher Osho, meditating and learning the Indian Bansuri. It was during this time that he took the spiritual name 'Praful' which he describes as symbolic of 'a new beginning' and meaning \"blossoming\".\n\nFollowing his travels to India, Praful spent 10 months in Brazil where his musical style took on heavy influences of Samba. Upon returning to Amsterdam in 1993, he worked mainly with Brazilian and Latin groups and artists including:\n\nFrom 1997 on he was drawn to electronica and newer developments in music like trip hop, dance and drum and bass.\n\nIn 1999 Praful joined the experimental dance formation Project 2000, a drum and bass group which experience regional success in the Netherlands. That year Project 2000 won the prestigious Dutch Heineken Cross Over Music Award. 1999 also saw the release of the Project 2000 album 'It's about time' and 2 singles with Universal/Polydor.\n\nFrom 1997 until 2002 he worked as reed player and composer with 'Bayuba Cante', an international group mixing Afro-Cuban Santería-roots with flamenco, rumba, Indian music, funk and jazz, with 2 albums released (Network-DE) and tours in Europe, Cuba and Canada.\n\nIn 1999 he released his first solo album, the meditative 'Touched by Love'. In that year he also started following lessons in Bansuri (Indian bamboo flute) with Indian Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia, who continues to be his teacher and great inspiration.\n\nIn 2001 Praful signed a deal with Dutch Indie label Therapy Records, for which he released 3 albums and several singles and vinyls until 2007. The international success of 'One Day Deep' made Praful a household name for Chill-, Jazz-, Dance- and Crossover-Fans. The album was produced and recorded by Praful with the producers duo Adani&Wolf, with guests Afra Mussawisade (percussion, Iran/Germany), Ted de Jong (tabla, Netherlands), Adrian Elissen (Spanish guitar, Malta), Jose Lopretti (bass, Uruguay) and Brazilian singer Lilian Vieira (Brazil/Zuco 103).\n\nPraful was influenced by pop music from a young age. Early saxophone influences included Jazz artists like Michael Brecker, Bob Berg and Wayne Shorter. During his studies at conservatory Praful began to be affected by the musical styles of John Coltrane and Charlie Parker.\n\nHe is influenced by many other non-saxophone instrumentalists. He lists Pat Metheny as one of his strongest influences saying \"...he always tried to play guitar [as if] he was a reed player.\" Metheny's earlier works exhibited a blend of new-age music, fusion and Brazilian which would also be exhibited in Praful's own music.\n\nPrimarily a jazz musician, Praful has recorded music from many different genres including pop music, urban, smooth jazz, new age, Afro-Cuban jazz, Latin music, Santería, flamenco, rumba, Indian music, funk, bossa nova, acid jazz.\n\n\n\nReferences: \n"}

He became sole manager after his partner's death in 1770 of a number of theatres on what was then called the Yorkshire Circuit, and he was both liberal and successful.

It is operated as a private non-profit organization, which leased the site from the city in the early 1960s. Stephen D. Bloom has been the chief executive officer of the Portland Japanese Garden since 2005.\n\nThe Portland Japanese Garden is composed of eight garden spaces and a Cultural Village. \nIn 2017, the Cultural Crossing expansion added three new Garden spaces.\nThe Garden Pavilion was built in 1980 in Japanese style by local builders: it has a tiled roof, wooden verandas, and Shōji sliding doors. It is the center of several Japanese cultural festivals, art exhibitions, and other events. The west veranda faces the Flat Garden, and the east veranda overlooks downtown Portland and Mount Hood, which resembles Mount Fuji. Dozens of stone lanterns are present throughout the garden. The lower entrance features a 100-year-old temple gate, a 1976 gift of the Japanese Ancestral Society of Portland Oregon.\n\nAs a Japanese garden, the desired effect is to realize a sense of peace, harmony, and tranquility and to experience the feeling of being a part of nature. Three of the essential elements used to create the garden are stone, the \"bones\" of the landscape; water, the life-giving force; and plants, the tapestry of the four seasons. Japanese garden designers feel that good stone composition is one of the most important elements in creating a well-designed garden. Secondary elements include pagodas, stone lanterns, water basins, arbors, and bridges. Japanese gardens are asymmetrical in design and reflect nature in idealized form. Traditionally, human scale is maintained throughout so that one always feels part of the environment and not overpowered by it.\n\nIn 1958, Portland became a sister city of Sapporo, Japan. This inspired Portland business leaders and public officials to create a Japanese garden in Portland. On June 4, 1962, the city council created a commission to establish the garden in Washington Park.\nThe Japanese Garden is built into a forested hillside in Washington Park on land that was previously the site of Portland's zoo until 1959. \nThe garden was designed by Professor Takuma Tono of the Tokyo University of Agriculture. The garden was dedicated and design began in 1963; the garden opened to the public in 1967.\n\nIn a study conducted in 2013 by the \"Journal of Japanese Gardening\", it was deemed the finest public Japanese garden in North America out of more than 300 such gardens surveyed by Japanese garden experts.\nThe former Japanese ambassador to the U.S., Nobuo Matsunaga, said in 1988 that the garden was “the most beautiful and authentic Japanese garden in the world outside Japan.”\n\nIn April 2017, the Garden unveiled its Cultural Crossing expansion project. This $33.5 million expansion added 3.4 acres to the Garden. The addition included three new garden spaces and a Cultural Village, designed by world-renowned architect Kengo Kuma. The Village is home to the Jordan Schnitzer Japanese Arts Learning Center, the Garden House, and the Umami Cafe by Ajinomoto. The new space is used for additional educational and artistic programming and to make room for the 350,000 guests the Garden sees each year.\nIn the Tateuchi courtyard, one can admire a 185-ft-long castle wall traditionally built by a 15th-generation Japanese master stonemason.\n\nThe Japanese Garden is close to Washington Park's main entrance, at the top of Park Place, just above and a short walk from the International Rose Test Garden. Parking inside Washington Park costs $2 per hour, to a maximum of $8 per day. TriMet bus route 63-Washington Park stops nearby and runs every day. The Washington Park Shuttle which connects the Washington Park MAX light rail station to the Japanese Garden daily from May through September, and on weekends in April and October. \nOnce at the garden, there is a shuttle that runs up the hill frequently.\n\nBecause the Portland Japanese Garden is a non-profit organization which receives no funding from the city of Portland, there is an admission fee:\nMembers get free admission among other benefits.\n\n"}

Gaston was married to Princess Isabel, heiress to the Brazilian throne.\n\nGaston was born Louis Philippe Marie Ferdinand Gaston of Orléans (Portuguese: Luís Filipe Maria Fernando Gastão de Orleães) on 28 April 1842 in Neuilly-sur-Seine, a suburb of Paris, at the Château de Neuilly. He was the eldest son of Louis, the Duke of Nemours and Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. His paternal grandparents were King Louis Philippe I, King of the French, and Maria Amalia of the Two Sicilies, and his maternal grandparents were Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Maria Antonia Koháry.\n\nA member of the French royal family, Gaston belonged to the House of Orléans, a cadet branch of the House of Bourbon, that in turn belonged to the Capetian Dynasty. A Prince of Orléans, he was titled Count of Eu (\"comte d'Eu\") at birth by his grandfather, King Louis Philippe.\n\nHe was a first cousin once removed of both the British Monarch Queen Victoria and of her husband Albert, Prince Consort, through his mother, Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n\nThe prince received a refined education under Julio Gauthier and the historian Auguste Trognon. He learned several foreign languages, which included Latin, English, German and Portuguese.\n\nHis grandfather abdicated during the Revolution of 1848. Only five years old at the time, Gaston followed the king and his family who went into exile in Great Britain, establishing themselves in an old mansion at Claremont, in the southern region of England.\n\nIn 1855, at the age of 13, Gaston began his military career in an artillery course, concluding in the Military School of Segovia, Spain, where he became a captain. He had moved to Spain, after following his uncle, Antoine, the Duke of Montpensier's orientation. The Duke had lived there since his marriage to Infanta Luisa Fernanda, sister of Queen Isabel II of Spain.\n\nAfter years with problems on the border with Morocco caused by constant attacks on Spanish cities by Moroccan pirates, Spain declared war on Morocco. The young Gaston was sent as a subordinate officer to participate in the conflict on the side of the Spanish forces. The Spanish military consisted of more than 40,000 soldiers, while the Moroccan troops numbered about 140,000 men. The Count participated in all of the battles, and after the end of the conflict he returned to Spain with a reputation for his military prowess.\n\nA few years later, his uncle, King Ferdinand II of Portugal proposed that he should marry one of the two daughters of the Emperor Pedro II of Brazil. He agreed to accept the proposal, but only after meeting the princesses. The Emperor's sister, Princess Francisca, who was married to the Count's uncle, the Prince of Joinville, wrote a letter to her brother describing the Count. \"If you could grab this one for one of your daughters it would be excellent. He is robust, high, handsome, good natured, very amiable, much instructed, studious, and in addition, he possesses now a small military fame.\"\nGaston arrived in Rio de Janeiro on 2 September 1864 in the company of his double first cousin, Prince Ludwig August of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and went directly to the Palace of São Cristóvão to meet the Brazilian imperial family. However, Gaston was less than enthusiastic about the two princesses, whom he considered unattractive. Initially, the young Count was promised to Princess Leopoldina and his cousin to Princess Isabel. However, after getting to know them better, the Emperor decided to invert the pairs. Gaston became attached to Isabel. They were married on 15 October 1864. Earlier, Gaston was awarded the Grand Cross of the Imperial Order of the Southern Cross and a few days later accepted the honorary presidency of the Brazilian Geographic and Historical Institute.\n\nIn 1892, Alfredo d'Escragnolle, the viscount of Taunay, gave his opinion regarding the two cousins when they first arrived in Brazil. He said that the duke of Saxe \"had only interest in spending his life in a lazy and amusing way, he liked a lot of hunting and appreciated a lot the many joys that existed in Europe, while the comte d'Eu with all the defects that I can point at him, cared sincerely and a lot for Brazil and, believe it or not, he still loves it today with intensity and no second intention.\"\n\nGaston and Isabel were travelling in Europe on their honeymoon when Paraguayan forces invaded the Brazilian provinces of Mato Grosso and Rio Grande Do Sul. From the city of Uruguaiana in the southern region of Brazil, Pedro II sent a letter to the couple requesting Gaston's presence in Brazil, directing the Count to join him and the Brazilian army, together with the Duke of Saxe.\n\nUruguaiana had been conquered by the Paraguayan army. The Conde d'Eu, and the Emperor, Pedro II of Brazil, joined President Bartolomé Mitre of Argentina in the Siege of Uruguaiana, which ended 18 September 1865.\n\nIn his memoirs, the Visconde of Taunay wrote of his experience in the Paraguayan War, along with observances of his fellow soldiers. \"While Gaston showed in all occasions a great interest for the things of Brazil, observing, asking, visiting all the places and going after correct and accurate information, while the other [August Luis, duke of Saxe] did not show anything except for indifference and lack of ambition.\" He was later nominated general commander of the artillery and president of the Commission of Improvements of the Army on 19 November 1865.\n\nOn two different occasions throughout the conflict, Gaston sent requests to the Emperor asking him to authorize his participation in the war against Paraguay. The Council of State declined his request. The rationale was a strategic act, believing that the presence of a prince in the conflict would escalate the desire to conquer their country's territories. Additionally, it was unacceptable for the husband of the heiress of the throne to subordinate to a Brazilian military officer, who, at this time, was Luis Alves de Lima and Silva, the Marquis of Caxias, the just-nominated allied commander-in-chief.\n\nOn 22 March 1869, Gaston was assigned to lead as commander-in-chief of the allied armies, after the Marquis of Caxias renounced that position. This delegation of authority was based on the prestige as an officer of high rank, as well as his reputation and well-known capacity in military action.\n\nThe choice of Gaston as the new commander-in-chief, at the age of 27, brought joy to the Brazilian public. During this time, the opinion of a great number of Brazilian citizens believed that the conflict and continued hunt for Francisco Solano López the Paraguayan dictator, was futile and unnecessary. Gaston shared this belief. When he arrived at Paraguay, he reorganized the Brazilian army and fired the officers accused of pillage in enemy territory.\n\nHe used diversified tactics to deceive the Paraguayan army about how and where the allied army would carry its attacks. In the opinion of the Viscount of Taunay, Gaston showed \"great strategical ability, cool temper, patience of an experienced leader and unquestionable courage.\" He also participated actively in the battles that occurred, in the Battle of Acosta Ñu, where he suffered great risk of life. It was the Count's idea to definitively extinguish the slavery of approximately 25,000 individuals in Paraguay, many of whom were obliged to fight in the war against the Triple Alliance.\n\nGaston suffered heavy criticism after he discovered that the brigadier João Manuel Mena Barreto had died in the battle that resulted in the conquest of the village of Piribebuy (Battle of Piribebuy) which at that time was named \"the third capital of Paraguay\" after the occupation of Asunción and Luque earlier in 1868. He was also criticized for ordering the decapitation of commander Pedro Pablo Caballero and Patricio Marecos, head politician of the village. In September, the Count became greatly depressed, due to the high number of deaths caused by the conflict. Until the end of the war on 1 March 1870, he participated nominally in the action of the allied army. When he returned to Brazil on 29 April 1870, he was received as a war hero. He was also nominated as a member of the Council of State on 6 July of the same year.\n\nAfter the 1960s, revisionist historians appeared, portraying the Gaston d'Orléans as a bloodthirsty mass murderer. Some historians, like Júlio Jose Chiavenato, accuse him of having committed war crimes and being most interested in engaging in war, if only to pursue López. Revisionist historians also accuse Gaston of having ordered a grass fire, in order to asphyxiate wounded Paraguayan soldiers who were still in the field after the battle of Acosta Ñu. Chiavenato uses as a source, the memoirs of the Viscount of Taunay.\n\nRecently, it has been found that the memoirs say something completely different. \"There were bullets that still blew up in the field because of the fire in the grass that was started in the beginning of the battle by the Paraguayans to occult their tactical movement.\" There is a mention of an episode, where Gaston ordered the troops to set fire in a hospital full of wounded Paraguayan soldiers that resulted in the death of more than a hundred victims. However, the hospital may have been collateral damage caused by allied bombardment at the beginning of the battle, directed on the Paraguayan military defense and not as the result of a deliberate desire of killing defenseless people.\n\nAlthough initially disillusioned with the seeming lack of beauty of his wife, Gaston came to love her until the last days of his life, a feeling returned by Isabel. The birth of their son, Pedro, on 15 October 1875, brought much happiness for the couple, who for almost ten years had been unable to conceive. The arrival of their son also served to lighten the pain of the loss of their first child, Luisa Victoria, who died due to complications of childbirth on 28 July 1874.\n\nAlthough crippled by a defect in the left arm caused by problems in childbirth, Pedro was a very healthy child and would be affectionately called \"Baby\" by his parents, even as a young adult. The Count always treated his wife with patience, pleasantness and determination to help her pass through the depression she suffered from, presuming that she somehow could have avoided Pedro's birth defect. His happiness became visible in the letter that he wrote to his father soon after the birth of his third child, in which he stated, \"We are really happy, grateful and glad. Having two healthy children after so many misfortunes that made me lose any hope of becoming a father, exceeds what I dared myself to expect.\"\n\nTheir third child was a son, Luiz de Orléans e Bragança, born 26 January 1878 and named after Gaston's father. Some years later, this child became Isabel's heir, after his elder brother renounced his succession to the throne. Antonio was the fourth and last son, born on 9 August 1881 in Paris, where the couple had lived for three years. Antonio was nicknamed \"Totó\" by his family.\n\nThe Count was a very simple person and tried to pass this characteristic on to his children. He had a complete aversion to the lifestyle of European nobility and royalty, which he called \"futile\" and \"stupid\".\n\nIn 1882, Gaston chose Benjamin Franklin Ramiz Galvão, a professor at the School of Medicine of Rio de Janeiro and headmaster of the National Library, to educate his children. The prince recognized the professor's merit and did not care that Benjamin was a republican. Gaston and his wife provided their children with a simple education, allowing them to study at the father Moreira's school in Petropolis, and later at the school Pedro II.\n\nFollowing his marriage to Isabel, Gaston participated actively in the Brazilian government, making commentaries and offering advice about the development of the country. The idea of living as a mere shadow to his wife deeply dissatisfied him. However, Pedro II never allowed either Gaston nor Isabel to participate in the decisions of the government, and refused to discuss state matters with the couple in any form.\n\nThis line of demarcation created serious discord between Gaston and his father-in-law, almost to the point of disruption had not Isabel interceded. She attempted to mediate the misunderstandings between the emperor and her husband. As time passed, Gaston became used to the idea of not having any power. It was 1889, before he was able to constructively discuss politics with his father-in-law for the first time.\n\nGaston's exclusion from the Brazilian political arena necessitated the pursuit of alternate activities. He and his wife turned their attention toward philanthropic endeavors, choosing to support several charities and social institutions. José Avelino, who participated in the first Brazilian republican constituent, years after the end of the monarchy made several remarks about the Count of Eu.\n\nGaston visited almost all of the provinces of the country, more than any other member of the Imperial Family. He travelled to the southern region, as well as the northeast and the far north of Brazil. By the end of the Empire, he made a great trip to the north of Brazil being very well received by all, showing that the monarchy was still popular. After he returned from the Paraguayan War as Marshal-of-the-Army, he became a member of several foreign and Brazilian associations. He was decorated with the medal of the Surrender of Uruguaiana; the Military Merit; the Campaign of Africa and the grand-crosses of Ernest Pious of Saxony; the Orders of the Tower and Sword of the Value, Loyalty and Merit of Christ and of Saint Bento of Avis of Portugal; the order of Leopold of Belgium; the Order of the Red Eagle of Mexico; and was made a knight of the Order of Saint Fernando of Spain.\n\nGaston was one of the few eyewitnesses of the military coup d'Etát that overthrew the Empire who left written memoirs of it. His three letters – written while he was still in Rio and later aboard the ship that was taking the Imperial family to exile – gives a detailed account of the coup and are one of the main primary sources used by historians. At the night of 14 November 1889 Gaston was in Rio de Janeiro in his home making the preparations to a reception in honor of Chilean Navy officers visiting the city. A Brazilian major came to warn him of something important, but being too busy and not told of how grave the matter was, Gaston did not meet him. At 8 am of the next day, 15 November, he went to ride with his sons in Botafogo (a neighborhood in Rio) \"with no preoccupation at all\", in his own words. Upon his return, he read all Rio's newspapers and only one mentioned that apparently a mutiny had occurred in the Military Academy and the Cabinet had met to deal with the matter. Little did Gaston know that a rebellion among the Army corps – led by Field Marshal (nowadays Divisional General) Deodoro da Fonseca – had removed from power by force the Cabinet the night before.\n\nAround 9h30 and 10h a.m. Gaston was told by two officers of what had happened. Soon others, including military officers, arrived \"with confusing news\". Upon hearing, Gaston commented: \"In this case, the monarchy has ended.\" Nonetheless, he dressed himself in his uniform of Marshal of the Army, hoping that it could make the rebels change theirs minds upon seeing their former commander-in-chief in Paraguay. But soon changed back to his civilian clothes when others around him suggested that it would be useless. Senator Manuel Pinto de Sousa Dantas, a former prime minister, later appeared and told him not to worry and gave his support to the monarchy. Lieutenant André Rebouças, embraced him and told of a plan he had envisioned with Major Alfredo d'Escragnolle Taunay, Viscount of Taunay, to leave to the nearby city of Petrópolis where they could resist the coup. Gaston agreed and tried to reach the telegraph central by telephone to request it to tell Emperor Pedro II to stay in Petrópolis. At that point, however, the republicans had taken control of the telegraph central. Nonetheless, a telegraph message informed them that the Emperor was arriving in Rio. Gaston sent his children to Petrópolis where he believed they would be safe.\n\nGaston, his wife Isabel and many others, met Pedro II in the City Palace, located in Rio downtown. It was already afternoon and Deodoro da Fonseca as well as the other rebels had returned to their homes. Unbeknownst to Gaston, Deodoro had not overthrown the Emperor, but only the Cabinet and the rebellion seemed to be all over. Pedro II told the prince that he was going to dissolve the rebel battalions. Gaston, far more realistic, complained that the rebels would not simply put their arms down by themselves. He also urged the monarch to form a new cabinet, since the country was effectively without a government. Pedro II did not bother, and told him that he would wait for the prime minister Viscount of Ouro Preto. \"But the ministers are prisoners of the rebels: how does Your Majesty wants them to able to continue to govern?\", asked the Prince. No matter what Gaston or the politicians and army officers told him, Pedro II did nothing nor allowed anyone to do anything during those precious hours. Tired of waiting, Gaston requested the presence of all Counselors of State to discuss the present and serious situation. As the Emperor refused to meet them, some of the counselors simply gave up and departed.\n\nThe ones who stood agreed to send an envoy to Deodoro to make peace with him. A major was sent and met with the rebel leader in his home at 3 am of 16 November, lying down in his bed, very sick. Deodoro told him that now was too late and he had made his mind and that the monarchy was over. And he also accused Gaston of being the one responsible for what the rebels regarded as harassment from the government against the Army. That revealed how successful had been the republican propaganda against the prince, who held absolutely no influence or power in the government. The Imperial family was banished and departed to Europe on 17 November. Despite the lack of any will to resist from Pedro II, there was significant monarchist reaction after the fall of the empire, which was thoroughly repressed.\n\nOn 15 November 1889 the Republic was proclaimed in Brazil. The Imperial family was forced into exile, first in Portugal and later in Normandy, at the Château d'Eu.\n\nIn 1891, Emperor Pedro II died in Paris and his daughter became Empress \"Isabel I of Brazil\" to the Brazilian Monarchists while, at the same time, the Count of Eu then became Emperor consort. But these titles had little weight and both spouses remained banished from their country.\n\nIt was only in 1921 already as a widower that the Count of Eu could finally set foot back in Brazil. At this occasion he retrieved the bodies of his parents-in-law to bury in the Imperial Mausoleum of the Cathedral of Petrópolis.\n\nThe following year, the Count of Eu eventually died a natural death out at sea on the coast of Brazil on August 28, 1922 during a journey that would take him back to Brazil to celebrate the first centenary of independence. His body and that of Princess Isabel returned to Brazil together on 7 July 1953, to be buried in the Imperial Mausoleum of the Cathedral of Petrópolis on 12 May 1971.\n\n\n\nPrince Gaston was Grand Cross of the following Brazilian Orders:\n\n\nHe was a recipient of the following foreign honors:\n\n\n\nExplanatory notes\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\n"}

Nevertheless, beer, particularly mass-produced pale lagers, are common in the country. It is traditionally considered to be an ideal accompaniment to pizza; since the 1970s, beer has spread from pizzerias and has become much more popular for drinking in other situations.\n\nIn the seventh century BC in Sicily, the Phoenicians traded and consumed beer. In Piedmont, Pombia, Province of Novara, an archaeological investigation found tombs from the Golasecca culture, including a tomb from 560 BC containing traces of beer. Ancient Rome knew of beer and produced small amounts, but the systems of production were destroyed in various barbarian invasions. The first medical school, the Schola Medica Salernitana, praised the substance stating that it \"supports old age, flows through the veins, increases well-being, and strengthens the blood.\"\n\nOn the occasion of his wedding, Ludovico Sforza distributed beer freely to the Milanese. At this time, it was referred to in Florence as \"barley wine\". The first brewery in Italy, according to Hermes Zampollo, was \"Spluga\" in Chiavenna, which opened in 1840. However, the company Wührer stated that its brewing commenced in Brescia in 1829. The first person in Italy to cultivate hops for beer brewing was Gaetano Pasqui in 1847. In 1983, the country consumed 12 million hectoliters of beer. As of 2010, Italy has a beer consumption of 30 litres per capita per year.\n\nOne of the oldest and most widespread breweries in Italy is Peroni, today owned by the Asahi group, which also owns the popular brand Nastro Azzurro.

It is located to the west of downtown and bordered by the Ottawa River to the north, the O-Train Trillium Line to the east, Scott Street to the south, and Parkdale Avenue to the west. East of Mechanicsville is LeBreton Flats, Tunney's Pasture is directly west, and Hintonburg is to the south. The total population of the neighbourhood as of the 2011 Census was 2,205.\n\nPlan of subdivision was prepared and certified by Robert Sparks, P.L.Surveyor in 1872, it being the property of Mrs T.M. Blasdel & A.H.Baldwin Esq, and certified as a true copy of plan 35A, 7 June 1976 by the Assistant Examiner of surveys. The Village of Mechanicsville being part of Lot 36 Concession A of Nepean.\n\nThe limits were (Burnside) to the north and running down to the Ottawa River at the Sluce cutting; First street on the east (Stonehurst Avenue); Road allowance and the Canada Central Railway to the south (Scott Street); Fifth Street (Parkdale Avenue) to the west.\n\nThe first modest houses were probably built about 1875. They were of wood balloon frame covered with 1x12 inch planks inside and out with wood or other siding, with the foundations projecting four inches beyond the edge of the finished frame to take a brick finish as people became able to afford this luxury.\n\nThe area was annexed to the city of Ottawa in 1911. Some sources suggest that the name Mechanicsville arose after this annexation because it became home to blue collar workers, especially those who worked in the rail yards, or lumber and paper mills who had been displaced by the Great Fire of 1900. In fact, Mechanicsville was known by that name as early as 1879 when it was shown in Belden's Historical Atlas of Carleton County in Nepean Twp., being part of Lot 36 in Concession A, Ottawa Front. Mechanicsville in 1879 was considerably smaller than the present day Ottawa neighbourhood. Its western boundary was then the present-day Parkdale Avenue.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, when what is now known as the Sir John A. Macdonald Parkway (formerly the Ottawa River Parkway) was being developed by the National Capital Commission, large sections of the neighbourhood along the river were expropriated and demolished. While this created green space, the parkway and on and off-ramps at Parkdale Avenue have also created a barrier to the waterfront.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, expansion of Scott Street, and the development of the Transitway along the old rail line on Scott has served to cut off the area from the area south of Scott, which was at one time, considered part of the Mechanicsville neighbourhood.\n\nThe area is mostly residential, of wood-frame/wood siding 1900s era homes on grid streets. Along Parkdale Avenue, there are several newer highrise apartment buildings. To the east is an older industrial area along Bayview.\n\nThe neighbourhood has good bus access and has experienced infilling of town homes in recent years. These include both low and high income housing. In 2007 a serious fire affected some high density social housing and the neighbourhood helped the victims of this fire. Prominent landmarks include the Protection of the Holy Virgin Memorial Church and the Embassy of Indonesia.\n"}

Smith's son Jaden Smith co-stars, making his film debut as Gardner's son, Christopher Jr. The screenplay by Steven Conrad is based on the best-selling 2006 memoir of the same name written by Gardner with Quincy Troupe. It is based on Gardner's nearly one-year struggle being homeless. The unusual spelling of the film's title comes from a mural that Gardner sees on the wall outside the daycare facility his son attends.\n\nThe film was released on December 25, 2006 by Columbia Pictures. Smith received acclaim for his performance and was nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe for Best Actor.\n\nIn 1981, San Francisco salesman Chris Gardner invests his entire life savings in portable bone density scanners, which he demonstrates to doctors and pitches as a handy quantum leap over standard X-rays. The scanners play a vital role in his life. While he is able to sell most of them, the time lag between the sales and his growing financial demands enrage his already alienated wife Linda, who works as a hotel maid. The financial instability increasingly erodes their marriage, in spite of them caring for Christopher Jr., their soon-to-be five-year-old son. Because Chris has trouble selling the scanners, as they only produce a slightly better picture than a common X-ray but for a much higher price, and hence does not make enough money to make ends meet, Linda has to work double shifts.\n\nWhile Gardner is trying to sell one of the scanners, he meets Jay Twistle, a manager for Dean Witter Reynolds, and impresses him by solving a Rubik's Cube during a taxi ride. After Jay leaves, Gardner lacks money to pay the fare and chooses to run instead, causing the driver to angrily chase him into a BART station. Gardner boards a train but loses one of his scanners in the process. His new relationship with Jay earns him the chance to become an intern stockbroker. The day before the interview, Gardner grudgingly agrees to paint his apartment so as to postpone being evicted due to his difficulty in paying the rent. While painting, Gardner is greeted by two policemen at his doorstep, who take him to the station, stating he has to pay for the numerous parking tickets he has accumulated. As part of the sanction, Gardner is ordered to spend the night in jail instead, complicating his schedule for the interview the next morning. He manages to arrive at Dean Witter's office on time, albeit still in his shabby clothes, wearing his undershirt, a gray jacket and jeans, with paint splashes all over his clothes and face. Despite his appearance, he impresses the interviewers and lands an unpaid internship. He would be among 20 interns competing for a paid position as a stockbroker.\n\nGardner's unpaid internship does not please Linda, who eventually leaves for New York because she might get a job at her sister's boyfriend's new restaurant. After Gardner bluntly says she is incapable of being a single mom, she agrees that Christopher Jr. will remain with his dad. Gardner is further set back when his bank account is garnished by the IRS for unpaid income taxes, and he and Christopher are evicted. He ends up with only $21.33, resulting in them being homeless, and they are forced at one point to stay in a restroom at a BART station overnight. Other days, he and Christopher spend nights at a homeless shelter, in BART, or, if he manages to procure sufficient cash, at a hotel. Later, Gardner finds the bone scanner that he lost in the BART station earlier and, after repairing it, sells it to a physician, thus completing the sales of all his scanners.\n\nDisadvantaged by his limited work hours, and knowing that maximizing his client contacts and profits is the only way to earn the broker position, Gardner develops a number of ways to make phone sales calls more efficiently, including reaching out to potential high-value customers, defying protocol. One sympathetic prospect who is a top-level pension fund manager even takes Chris and Christopher to a San Francisco 49ers game at Candlestick Park. Regardless of his challenges, he never reveals his lowly circumstances to his colleagues, even going so far as to lend one of his bosses $5 for cab fare, a sum that he cannot afford. Concluding his six-month-internship, Gardner is called into a meeting with his managers. To break the ice, Gardner jokes that he is wearing a shirt (unlike the undershirt he wore during his interview) as it is his last day and thought to dress for the occasion. The manager Martin Frohm smiles and says he should wear another one tomorrow as it will be his first day, letting him know that he has won the coveted full-time position and giving him back his $5 as he promised. Fighting back tears, Gardner shakes hands with them, then rushes to his son's daycare to embrace Christopher. They walk down the street, joking with each other (and are passed by the real Chris Gardner, in a business suit). The epilogue reveals that Gardner went on to form his own multimillion-dollar brokerage firm.\n\n\nChris Gardner realized his story had Hollywood potential after an overwhelming national response to an interview he did with \"20/20\" in January 2002. He published his autobiography on May 23, 2006, and later became an associate producer for the film. The movie took some liberties with Gardner's true life story. Certain details and events that actually took place over the span of several years were compressed into a relatively short time and although eight-year-old Jaden portrayed Chris as a five-year-old, Gardner's son was just a toddler at the time. Towards the end Chris Gardner has a brief uncredited cameo appearance before the credits.\n\nChris Gardner initially thought Smith, an actor best known for his performances in blockbuster films, was miscast to play him. However, he claimed his daughter Jacintha said, \"If [Smith] can play Muhammad Ali, he can play you!\", referring to Smith's role in the biopic \"Ali\" (2001).\n\nVarèse Sarabande released a soundtrack album with the score composed by Andrea Guerra on January 9, 2007.\n\nAlso in the film are brief portions of \"Higher Ground\" and \"Jesus Children of America\", both sung by Stevie Wonder, and \"Lord, Don't Move the Mountain\" by Mahalia Jackson and Doris Akers, sung by the Glide Ensemble.\n\nThe film debuted first at the North American box office, earning $27 million during its opening weekend and beating out heavily promoted films such as \"Eragon\" and \"Charlotte's Web\". It was Smith's sixth consecutive #1 opening and one of Smith's consecutive $100 million blockbusters. The film grossed $162,586,036 domestically in the US and Canada. In the hope Gardner's story would inspire the down-trodden citizens of Chattanooga, Tennessee to achieve financial independence and to take greater responsibility for the welfare of their families, the mayor of Chattanooga organized a viewing of the film for the city's homeless. Gardner himself felt that it was imperative to share his story for the sake of its widespread social issues. \"When I talk about alcoholism in the household, domestic violence, child abuse, illiteracy, and all of those issues—those are universal issues; those are not just confined to ZIP codes,\" he said.\n\nThe film was released on DVD on March 27, 2007, and as of November 2007, US Region 1 DVD sales accounted for an additional $89,923,088 in revenue, slightly less than half of what was earned in its first week of release. About 5,570,577 units have been sold, bringing in $90,582,602 in revenue.\n\nThe film was received generally positively by critics, with Will Smith receiving widespread acclaim for his performance. Film review site Rotten Tomatoes calculated a 67% overall approval based on 175 reviews, with an average rating of 6.39/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Will Smith's heartfelt performance elevates \"The Pursuit of Happyness\" above mere melodrama.\"\n\nIn the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", Mick LaSalle observed, \"The great surprise of the picture is that it's not corny ... The beauty of the film is its honesty. In its outlines, it's nothing like the usual success story depicted on-screen, in which, after a reasonable interval of disappointment, success arrives wrapped in a ribbon and a bow. Instead, this success story follows the pattern most common in life—it chronicles a series of soul-sickening failures and defeats, missed opportunities, sure things that didn't quite happen, all of which are accompanied by a concomitant accretion of barely perceptible victories that gradually amount to something. In other words, it all feels real.\"\n\nManohla Dargis of \"The New York Times\" called the film \"a fairy tale in realist drag ... the kind of entertainment that goes down smoothly until it gets stuck in your craw ... It's the same old bootstraps story, an American dream artfully told, skillfully sold. To that calculated end, the film making is seamless, unadorned, transparent, the better to serve Mr. Smith's warm expressiveness ... How you respond to this man's moving story may depend on whether you find Mr. Smith's and his son's performances so overwhelmingly winning that you buy the idea that poverty is a function of bad luck and bad choices, and success the result of heroic toil and dreams.\"\n\nPeter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" awarded the film three out of a possible four stars and commented, \"Smith is on the march toward Oscar ... [His] role needs gravity, smarts, charm, humor and a soul that's not synthetic. Smith brings it. He's the real deal.\"\n\nIn \"Variety\", Brian Lowry said the film \"is more inspirational than creatively inspired—imbued with the kind of uplifting, afterschool-special qualities that can trigger a major toothache ... Smith's heartfelt performance is easy to admire. But the movie's painfully earnest tone should skew its appeal to the portion of the audience that, admittedly, has catapulted many cloying TV movies into hits ... In the final accounting, [it] winds up being a little like the determined salesman Mr. Gardner himself: easy to root for, certainly, but not that much fun to spend time with.\"\n\nKevin Crust of the \"Los Angeles Times\" stated, \"Dramatically it lacks the layering of a \"Kramer vs. Kramer\", which it superficially resembles ... Though the subject matter is serious, the film itself is rather slight, and it relies on the actor to give it any energy. Even in a more modest register, Smith is a very appealing leading man, and he makes Gardner's plight compelling ... \"The Pursuit of Happyness \" is an unexceptional film with exceptional performances ... There are worse ways to spend the holidays, and, at the least, it will likely make you appreciate your own circumstances.\"\n\nIn the \"St. Petersburg Times\", Steve Persall graded the film B- and added, \"[It] is the obligatory feel-good drama of the holiday season and takes that responsibility a bit too seriously ... the film lays so many obstacles and solutions before its resilient hero that the volume of sentimentality and coincidence makes it feel suspect ... Neither Conrad's script nor Muccino's redundant direction shows [what] lifted the real-life Chris above better educated and more experienced candidates, but it comes through in the earnest performances of the two Smiths. Father Will seldom comes across this mature on screen; at the finale, he achieves a measure of Oscar-worthy emotion. Little Jaden is a chip off the old block, uncommonly at ease before the cameras. Their real-life bond is an inestimable asset to the on-screen characters' relationship, although Conrad never really tests it with any conflict.\"\n\n\"National Review Online\" has named the film #7 in its list of 'The Best Conservative Movies'. Linda Chavez of the Center for Equal Opportunity wrote, \"this film provides the perfect antidote to Wall Street and other Hollywood diatribes depicting the world of finance as filled with nothing but greed.\"\n\n\n"}

It is the only law school in the state and was founded in 1973 by Robert H. Rines as the Franklin Pierce Law Center, named after the 14th President of the United States and New Hampshire native. The school is particularly well known for its Intellectual Property Law program. On April 27, 2010, Franklin Pierce Law Center formally signed an agreement to affiliate with the University of New Hampshire.\n\nThe University of New Hampshire School of Law was founded in 1973 as the Franklin Pierce Law Center, becoming the first law school in New Hampshire. On April 27, 2010, Franklin Pierce Law Center formally signed an affiliation agreement with the University of New Hampshire. The school was renamed the University of New Hampshire School of Law when the affiliation became effective.\n\nAs of 2018, among all ranked law schools in the United States, UNH Law is 85th. The school has been among the top 10 intellectual property law schools in the United States for the past 25 years. In its 2019 ranking of \"America's Best Intellectual Property Law Programs\", \"U.S. News & World Report\" ranked UNH Law's program 5th in the nation in the intellectual property specialty rankings. Most recently, UNH Law was ranked 48th by Above The Law's 2018 rankings which are outcome (i.e. bar pass and employment results) oriented.\n\nUNH Law offers a JD program, as well as masters-level programs in the law, including the Master of Laws in Intellectual Property (L.L.M-IP), Master of Laws in Commerce and Technology (LLM-CT), and Master of Law in International Criminal Law and Justice (L.L.M-ICLJ). It is the only law school in the United States offering a graduate degree in intellectual property designed for scientists, engineers and any interested persons not holding a law degree (M.I.P.).\n\nIn 2005, the New Hampshire Supreme Court launched an alternative bar licensing process at the UNH School of Law. The Daniel Webster Scholar Honors Program, a collaboration of the Court, New Hampshire School of Law, the New Hampshire Board of Bar Examiners, and the New Hampshire Bar Association, is an intensive practice-based honors program that encompasses the last two years of law school. Students apply to the program during the spring of their 1L (first) year. Enrollment in the program is limited to 20 students per class year for 40 total. Once accepted to the program, students go through a rigorous program of clinical experiences under the supervision of judges, lawyers, and bar examiners, and compile a portfolio of work. Graduates of the program must pass the Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination (MPRE) and meet character and fitness requirements to be admitted to the New Hampshire bar, but are exempt from taking the state's bar examination. Webster Scholar graduates may still qualify to sit for the bar examination in any other U.S. jurisdiction. The first class of Webster Scholars graduated in 2008.\n\nStudents from around the world attend UNH Law, and the school celebrates the traditions and cultures of its many international students throughout the year. The school hosts events such as Lunar New Year, the Indian \"festival of lights\" or Diwali, an Afro-Caribbean Night and a Christmas party. Each summer, UNH Law holds the Intellectual Property Summer Institute, during which student barbecues have become a tradition on evenings during summer. During Orientation Week, students partake in an annual ice cream social. Fall mid-terms are followed closely each year by the Buck Bowl, an intramural touch football tournament, and the JIVE! talent show. With a tradition rich in public service, the school hosts the Bruce Friedman Community Service Day each year, honoring the late professor Bruce E. Friedman, an advocate of social justice.\n\nAccording to New Hampshire University School of Law's official 2017 ABA-required disclosures, 95% of the Class of 2017 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required employment nine months after graduation. For the class of 2017, only 3 out of 61 students were unemployed as the other 58 held either bar required jobs, J.D. advantage jobs, or professional positions.\n\nThe tuition at the University of New Hampshire School of Law for the 2018–2019 academic year is $37,401 for NH residents, and $41,401 for non-residents. The Law School Transparency estimated debt-financed cost of attendance for three years is $201,783; only 1.9% of students pay full price, however.\n\nIn February 2011, UNH Law entered into an exchange agreement with Shanghai Jiao Tong University, KoGuan Law School allowing students from each institution to enroll abroad for a semester. Classes in both countries will be taught in English and credits will transfer to the student's home school. The school holds several summer programs in the law that are open to students from other schools, including: the China Intellectual Property Summer Institute in cooperation with Tsinghua University Law School in Beijing; the eLaw Summer Institute in collaboration with the University College Cork Faculty of Law in Cork, Ireland; the Intellectual Property Summer Institute, hosted at New Hampshire Law's main campus; and the Advanced Topics in International Criminal Law and Justice Seminar in Washington, D.C.\n\nStudents run a variety of professional and cultural organizations, including the Student Bar Association (SBA) which serves as the student government.

{"id": "2163006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2163006", "title": "Unlawful assembly", "text": "Unlawful assembly\n\nUnlawful assembly is a legal term to describe a group of people with the mutual intent of deliberate disturbance of the peace. If the group is about to start the act of disturbance, it is termed a rout; if the disturbance is commenced, it is then termed a riot. In Britain, the offence was abolished in 1986.\n\nBy the 19th century, \"unlawful assembly\", a term used in English law described a gathering of three or more people with intent to commit a crime by force, or to carry out a common purpose (whether lawful or unlawful), in such a manner or in such circumstances as would in the opinion of firm and rational men endanger the public peace or create fear of immediate danger to the tranquillity of the neighborhood. A reform commission in 1879 believed that what underlay the first on-point legislation of 1328, outlining when such a crime was recognised nationally (still to adjudged by or via a justice of the peace) was certain landed proprietors at loggerheads employing a band of violent armed retainers, above the traditional manorial bailiffs.\n\nIn the Year Book, a legal text, of the third year of Henry VII's reign, assemblies were expressed as not punishable unless \"in terrorem: populi domini regis\", a threat to the people, God or the King.\n\nIn 1882 it was ruled, on balance, an unlawful assembly would need to be more than participants knowing beforehand of likely formal opposition and the mere prospect of a breach of the peace; by this date a quiltwork of cases had identified certain rights to orderly, lawful protest. All people may, and must if called upon to do so, assist in dispersing an unlawful assembly. An assembly which was lawful could not be rendered unlawful by (court) proclamation unless it were one authorized by statute.\n\nCementing the English Bill of Rights 1689 banning private armies, meetings for training or drilling, or military movements, were from 1820 unlawful assemblies unless held under lawful authority from the Crown, the Lord-lieutenant, or two justices of the peace.\n\nAn unlawful assembly which has made a motion towards its common purpose was termed a \"rout\", if it carried out all or part of its end purpose, e.g. begin to demolish an enclosure, it became a \"riot\". All three offences were misdemeanors in English law, punishable by fine and imprisonment. The first of these three offences (listed) was abolished by the Public Order Act 1986 for two parts of the UK, the most recent major reform of public order offences, the other two parts having similar legislation.\n\nThe common law as to unlawful assembly extended to Ireland, subject to special legislation. The law of Scotland included unlawful assembly under the same head as rioting.\n\nSection 144 is a section of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which prohibits assembly of five or more people, holding of public meetings, and carrying of firearms and can be invoked for up to two months. It also gives the magistracy the power to issue order absolute at once in urgent cases of nuisance or apprehended danger. With the introduction of Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) in 1976, Section 144 has ceased to operate in the metropolitan jurisdiction in Bangladesh.\n\nUnder Part II of the Canadian Criminal Code (Offences Against Public Order), Unlawful Assemblies and Riots is when the assembly of three or more people who cause fear and on reasonable grounds disturb peace in the neighborhood is against the law.\n\nThe Public Order Ordinance (chapter 245 of the laws of Hong Kong) defines \"unlawful assembly\" (§18) as an assembly of three or more people conducting themselves in a \"disorderly, intimidating, insulting or provocative manner intended or likely to cause a person reasonably to fear that the people so assembled will conduct a breach of the peace or will by such conduct provoke other persons to commit a breach of the peace\". people taking part in unlawful assemblies can be punished with up to five years' imprisonment (if indicted) or a level 2 fine (HK$5000) and imprisonment for two years (on summary conviction).\n\nSection 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) of 1973 empowers an executive magistrate to issue orders in urgent cases of nuisance or apprehended danger. Though the scope of Section 144 is wider, it is often used to prohibit assembly of one or more persons when unrest is anticipated. Section 129 of the CrPC grants Executive Magistrates and Police officers in charge of a police station and above the power to order dispersal of, disperse and cause to be dispersed any unlawful assembly. Section 130 authorizes an Executive Magistrate to obtain the aid of the Armed Forces to disperse any such assembly, and Section 131 grants any Gazetted Officer of the Armed Forces the power to use his troops to disperse a manifestly dangerous assembly even without command from a Magistrate (he must, however, contact an Executive Magistrate as soon as possible and then follow his instructions while taking any further actions). \n\nThe definition of 'unlawful assembly', according to Indian law, is laid down in Section 141 of the Indian Penal Code. According to this section, an assembly of five or more persons becomes unlawful when its purpose is or becomes:\n\n\nSection 146 defines 'rioting' is defined as the offence every member of an unlawful assembly commits, when that assembly or any member of such assembly uses force or violence in pursuit of their common intent. \n\nAccording to Sections 141-149 of the IPC, the maximum punishment for engaging in rioting is rigorous imprisonment for 3 years and/or fine. Every member of an unlawful assembly can be held responsible for a crime committed by the group. Obstructing an officer trying to disperse an unlawful assembly may attract further punishment.\n\nIn about 1861, Officer Raj-Ratna E.F. Deboo IPS was the designer and architect of section 144, which reduced overall crime in that time in the state of Baroda. He was recognized for his initiative and awarded a gold medal by the Maharaja Gaekwad of Baroda for putting Section 144 in place and reducing overall crime.\n\n\nSee also: http://law.jrank.org/pages/11014/Unlawful-Assembly.html\n"}

He adopted the name David d'Angers, following his entry into the studio of the painter Jacques-Louis David in 1809 as a way of both expressing his patrimony and distinguishing himself from the master painter.\n\nHe was born in Angers in 1788. His father was a wood carver and ornamental sculptor, who had joined the volunteer Republican army as a musketeer, fighting against the Chouans of La Vendée. He studied in the studio of Jean-Jacques Delusse and in 1808 traveled to Paris to study in the studio of Philippe-Laurent Roland.\n\nWhile in Paris he did work both on the Arc de Triomphe and the exterior of the Louvre. In 1810 he succeeded in taking the second place prize at the École des Beaux-Arts for his Othryades. In 1811 David's \"La Douleur\" won the École's competition for \"tête d'expression\" followed by his taking of the Prix de Rome for his \"Epaminondas\" in the same year. He spent five years in Rome, during which time he frequented the studio of Antonio Canova and made small trips around Italy to Venice, Naples and Florence.\n\nReturning from Rome around the time of the restoration of the Bourbons and their accompanying foreign conquerors and returned royalists, David d'Angers would not remain in the neighborhood of the Tuileries, opting instead to travel to London. Here John Flaxman and others took him to task for the political sins of David the painter, to whom he was erroneously supposed to be related.\n\nWith great difficulty he made his way to Paris again, where a comparatively prosperous career opened before him. His medallions and busts were in much request, as well as orders for monumental works. One of the most famous of these was that of \"Gutenberg at Strassburg\"; but those he himself valued most were the statue of \"Barra\" (Joseph Bara), a drummer boy who purportedly continued to beat his drum until the moment of death in the war in La Vendée, and the monument to the Greek liberator Markos Botsaris. \n\nDavid's busts and medallions were very numerous, and among his sitters may be found not only the illustrious men and women of France, but many others both of England and Germany countries which he visited professionally in 1827 and 1829. His medallions number over 500.\n\nDavid's fame rests firmly on his pediment of the Pantheon, his marble \"Wounded Philopoemen\" in the Louvre and his equestrian monument to General Jacques-Nicolas Gobert in Père Lachaise Cemetery. In addition to that of Gobert, he did sculptures for seven other tombs at Père Lachaise, including the bronze busts of the writer, Honoré de Balzac and physician Samuel Hahnemann.\n\nIn the \"Musée David\" in Angers is an almost complete collection of his works either in the form of copies or in the original moulds. As an example of his benevolence of character may be mentioned his rushing off to the sickbed of Rouget de Lisle, the author of the \"Marseillaise Hymn\", modelling and carving him in marble without delay, making a lottery of the work, and sending to the poet in the extremity of need the proceeds.\n\nOf \"Reviving Greece\", his monument to the Greek liberator Markos Botsaris, showing a Greek child reading his name, Victor Hugo said, \"It is difficult to see anything more beautiful in the world; this statue joins the grandeur of Pheidias to the expressive manner of Puget.\"\n\n\n\n"}

A career .307 hitter, he retired with 2,018 hits, then the third-highest total by an AL right-handed hitter. His 1,671 games at first base were the most by an AL right-handed player until 1940; he still ranks third in league history.\n\nBorn in Niles, Ohio, Burns was a line drive hitter and a solid defensive first baseman who hit .300 or better in all but one of his full seasons between 1918 and 1927. After four unremarkable seasons with the Detroit Tigers (1914–17), he was acquired by the Philadelphia Athletics in 1918. In his first season with the team he hit .352, surpassed only by the .382 of Detroit's Ty Cobb, and led the AL in hits (178) and total bases (236) while also setting a league record with 109 double plays at first base (Earl Sheely surpassed the mark three years later). After slipping to .296 in 1919, he was sent to the Indians in May 1920.\n\nDuring the 1920 regular season, Burns was stuck behind regular first baseman Doc Johnston; but his play revived in the World Series, in which he and Johnston were platooned by manager Tris Speaker. Burns started Game 6, and with the Indians up 3–2 in the Series and no score in the sixth inning, Burns doubled home Speaker with the only run of the game as the Indians edged the Brooklyn Dodgers 1–0 to take a 4–2 lead in the nine-game series. Cleveland won again the next day, capturing the first Series title for the franchise.\n\nDuring the season, after shortstop Ray Chapman died one day after being hit by a pitch, Burns had welcomed newly acquired Joe Sewell by giving him one of his own bats; Sewell went on to use the same bat, which he called \"Black Betsy\", throughout a 14-year career in which he struck out only 114 times.\n\nAfter the 1921 season, in which he and Johnston again competed for playing time, he was traded to the Boston Red Sox, and batted .306 and .328 in 1922 and 1923, finishing second in the league in doubles the latter year. He got the first hit ever in Yankee Stadium in 1923, and on September 14 of that year against the Indians, Burns turned an unassisted triple play – only the fourth in major league history, and the first by a first baseman. In the second inning, he caught Frank Brower's line drive, tagged Walt Lutzke off first base and actually ran to second base, sliding in before Riggs Stephenson could return from third. The following January, he was traded back to the Indians – notably, in a deal which involved Bill Wambsganss, who had turned the only unassisted triple play in World Series history as Burns' teammate in 1920.\n\nBack with Cleveland, Burns hit over .300 in each of the next four seasons and was regularly among the league leaders in doubles. In 1926 he broke Speaker's 1923 major league mark of 59 doubles; his record was broken in 1931 by Earl Webb, though Burns still retains a share of the mark for right-handed hitters, along with Joe Medwick. Burns also led the league in hits (216) for the second time, and was second in the league in runs batted in (RBIs), behind Babe Ruth. For his accomplishments that year he was named the MVP, becoming the first Cleveland player to be so honored, and in May 1927 he was presented with an automobile and a silver bat containing $1,150 during a day honoring him. In 1928 he broke Stuffy McInnis's AL record of 1,608 games at first base, though Joe Judge passed him later that year; his AL mark for right-handed players was broken in 1940 by Jimmie Foxx, and he still trails only Foxx and George Scott in league history.\n\nAfter being sent to the New York Yankees in late 1928, Burns appeared in only 13 games for the team before rejoining the Athletics in 1929. He ended his career with an unusual pinch-hitting appearance in the 1929 World Series, in which he won his second championship. In the fourth game, he was sent in to bat for the pitcher with the Athletics down 8–3, and was retired twice in a 10-run inning that resulted in a victory. In his 16-season career, Burns hit 72 home runs with 954 RBIs in 1866 games played. With 2,018 hits, he then trailed only Nap Lajoie (2,523) and Harry Heilmann (2,499) in AL history among right-handed hitters; his 444 career doubles ranked eighth in major league history among right-handers, and fifth among all AL players. With 110 times being hit by a pitch, he ranked second in the AL to Kid Elberfeld.\n\nFollowing his major league career he played for five seasons in the Pacific Coast League, leading the league in RBIs in 1932, and managed in the minors until 1939. He left baseball to become a deputy sheriff in the Seattle area (King County) until his retirement in 1967.\n\nBurns died in early 1978 at Evergreen Hospital in Kirkland at age 84, and was buried at Calvary Cemetery in Seattle.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2163042", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2163042", "title": "Id Gah Mosque", "text": "Id Gah Mosque\n\nId Gah Mosque or Eid Gah Mosque () is the second largest mosque in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan. It is considered the cardinal religious mosque in the country, where a million people offer Eid prayers twice a year. It is located near the Mahmud Khan bridge and National Stadium in the eastern part of the city, in the Shar-e-barq of Kabul, which is one of the wealthier areas of the city. The \"Id Gah\" or \"Eid Gah\" refers to an open space where people congregate during national and religious celebrations. The open grounds of Id Gah are also used as a parking lot for trucks that transport goods to and from Peshawar.\n\nIn most references Babur, a Muslim warrior at the time had just invaded and devastated India and ordered a Mosque be built to glorify Islam, he had his warriors bring back precious stone from the Punjab, Sindh and surrounding areas and had Persian architects build a structure for his Kabul subjects. It has been the scene of religious festivals, religious ceremonies, state functions such as coronations and priestly religious ceremonies attended by Kings and Amirs. It was from this mosque that the then Amir Habibullah made his historic announcement of his country's independence, in 1919.\n\nThe Id Gah Mosque was stated to be a target of attack when two suspects were arrested on February 10, 2006 with their vehicle found loaded with 8 kg of explosives.\n\nId Gah Mosque was commissioned by Babur the ruler of the Mughal empire before being renovated on a large scale by King Abdur Rahman Khan in 1893 or before. Another story relates to Jahangir being the original builder of this mosque, using local quarries and materials as Kabul was a key mughal city works of art were often commissioned here. \n\nAfghan history records indicate that in 1901, the then Emir of Afghanistan, the head of the state, publicly performed the priestly functions by celebrating the Id at Id Gah Mosque. The chief priest of Kabul immediately proclaimed Habibullah to be the successor of Mohamed, whereupon the Emir of Afghanistan delivered an address inspired by an \"intolerant ecclesiasticism\". Among other things the Amir passed a dictum that a fine of up to ten Kabuli Rupees would be levied on all who did not offer prayers in the mosques. A register of the daily attendance of all individuals was to be kept in various places and a “box of justice” was to be kept into which secret reports could be dropped reporting on people who had not obeyed this dictum of compulsory attendance for religious prayers at the mosques.\n\nIn 1914–15, the bitter feud between Britain and Afghanistan assumed the proportions of a holy war or jihad, even though the new ruler Emir Habibullah had initially opposed this approach of the mullahs. After his ascension to the throne in 1919, he aligned with the mullahs to attack British bases. Before he launched a war on May 15, 1919, the Emir made a speech at the Id Gah Mosque in Kabul urging his countrymen to wage jihad against the British. \nAfter the Third Anglo-Afghan War, on August 19, 1919, Emir Amanullah announced Afghanistan's independence from this mosque.\n\nOn September 21, 2010 a demonstration took place at the mosque.\n\nId Gah Mosque is located in an affluent part of Kabul and reflects the rich Muslim architecture and heritage. It attracts pilgrims from far-afield to visit this holy place. The mosque is painted in beige and white and has four minarets at the front, two flanking the higher central arch and then one either side of the arched sections on either side of the central arch.

He entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge in 1769, but in 1771 entered the navy as an able seaman; in 1774 he became member of Parliament for Great Marlow; and in 1775 he was created a baronet, the baronetcy held by his ancestors, the Borlases, having become extinct in 1689.\nOn the 12th of Dec. 1780 he married Caroline daughter of Lt.-Gen. Sir John Clavering. She died in 1839.\n\nHis career as a seaman really began in 1777, and two years later he obtained command of a ship. In April 1794, as Commodore of the frigate squadron off the north west French coast assisting in the blockade of Brest, Warren and his squadron captured a number of French frigates. In 1795, he commanded one of the two squadrons carrying troops for the Quiberon expedition and in 1796 his frigate squadron off Brest is said to have captured or destroyed 220 vessels. In October 1798, a French fleet — carrying 5,000 men — sailed from Brest intending to invade Ireland. The plan was frustrated in no small part due to the squadron under his command during the Action of 12 October 1798 off Donegal.\n\nIn 1802, he was sworn of the Privy Council and sent to St. Petersburg as ambassador extraordinary, but he did not forsake the sea. In 1806 he captured a large French warship, the \"Marengo\", at the Action of 13 March 1806. He was commander-in-chief on the North American Station from 1807 to 1810. He became an admiral in 1810, and was commander-in-chief on this Station again from 1813 to 1814. While in Halifax he determined the late commander John Shortland's dog had been stolen from London and brought to Halifax. He had the dog returned to London to Shortland's widow. During the British invasion of Maryland in 1814, he led a detail of British troops that occupied Havre de Grace and set fire to much of the town, including the home of Commodore John Rodgers. He died on 27 February 1822. His two sons predeceased him. His daughter and heiress, Frances Maria (1784–1837), married George Venables-Vernon, 4th Baron Vernon. Their son was George Venables-Vernon, 5th Baron Vernon.\n\nThere is a monument to him in St. Mary's Church, Attenborough in Nottinghamshire.

The oldest Muslim political party in Afghanistan, it was originally formed as a student political society at Kabul University. The majority of the party are ethnic Tajiks of northern and western Afghanistan. It has a communitarian ideology based on Islamic law. During the Soviet–Afghan War and the following Afghan Civil War against the communist government, Jamiat-e Islami was one of the most powerful of the mujahideen groups. Burhanuddin Rabbani led the party (including its predecessors) from 1968 to 2011, and served as President of the Islamic State of Afghanistan from 1992 to 2001 (in exile from 1996).\n\nJamiat \"emerged\" in 1972 from among \"the informal Islamist groupings that had existed since the 1960s\". Led by Burhanuddin Rabbani, a professor of Islamic theology at Kabul University, it was inspired by Abul A'la Maududi and his Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan. When Rabbani's arrest was ordered by Mohammad Daoud Khan in 1973, it was to Pakistan that Rabbani fled, and Jamaat-e-Islami who initially hosted him there. (Later Jamait lost the backing of Jamaat-e-Islami to the more purist \"Hezb-i Islami\".)\n\nIn Pakistan, Professor Rabbani gathered important people and continued to build the party. Sayed Noorullah Emad, who was then a young Muslim at Kabul University became its general secretary and, later, its deputy chief. Some of its prominent commanders included Ustad Zabihullah, Ahmad Shah Massoud, Ismail Khan, Atta Muhammad Nur, Mullah Naqib and Dr. Fazlullah. Ahmad Shah Massoud directed the military wing of the party.\n\nAhmad Shah Massoud and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar were both early followers of Rabbani, being Kabul University students at the time. Hekmatyar broke away from Jamiat in 1976 to found his own party: Hezb-e Islami.\n\nThe two groups formed the two main tendencies of the Islamist movement in Afghanistan, and after the April 1978 coup and the brutality of the invading Soviet Army, the two strongest Afghan mujahideen groups in the 1980s.\n\nRabbani and the Jamiat advocated \"building of a widely based movement that would create popular support\", a gradualist strategy of infiltration of society and the state apparatus to gain power. Jamiat was dominated by Tajiks but had a greater `tribal and regional cross section` than other groups, and was willing to seek \"common ground\" with non-Islamists. It gained prominence because of the battlefield success of Ahmad Shah Massoud.\n\nHezb-i Islami was overwhelmingly Ghilzai Pashtun, and backed by Pakistan president Zia ul-Haq. Its leader, Hekmatyar, was \"implacably hostile to any form of compromise\" favoring violent armed conflict. As a result, Hezb-i Islami, and not Jamiat, gained the support of the Muslim Brotherhood, Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan, and Saudi Arabian networks.\n\nAfter the Soviet invasion in Afghanistan in 1979, Massoud organised a mujahideen group in Parwan Province to fight against the Communist government and their Soviet allies. This group grew to control multiple provinces and include thousands of fighters. The Soviet Army launched a series of major offensives to attempt to destroy their forces, but they were unable to engage most of Massoud's men.\n\nAfter the withdrawal of the Soviet troops in 1989, the mujahideen groups continued to wear down government forces. However they also fought among each other: in June 1990, battles between Jamiat and Gulbuddin's Hezb in Logar and Parwan caused hundreds of casualties on each side.\n\nIn 1992 the communist government collapsed entirely. Jamiat's forces were among the first to enter Kabul. Meanwhile, a peace and power-sharing agreement among the leadership of the Afghan political party leaders led to a tentative agreement to appoint Burhanuddin Rabbani, who had spent the civil war in exile, as interim president. The peace agreement was called the Peshawar Accords.\n\nGulbuddin Hekmatyar however, did not support the peace agreement despite the fact that he was repeatedly offered the position of prime minister. Subsequently his Hezb-i Islami attacked the new interim government and the capital of Kabul with tens of thousands of rockets. As Hezb-i Wahdat and Ittihad-i Islami started a second war in 1992 and Dostum's Junbish-i Milli joined Hekmatyar in 1994, Kabul witnessed a gruesome war with massive civilian casualties and destruction of much of the city. In 1995 the Islamic State of Afghanistan government also with Jamiat forces retained control of Kabul, pushing back a coalition of Hekmatyar's Hezb-i Islami, the Hizb-i-Wahdat and Abdul Rashid Dostum's Jumbish-i-Milli Islami.\n\nBy 1995, the Taliban, which had seized control of much of southern Afghanistan with comparative ease the previous year, were advancing on Kabul. Jamiat rejected Taliban demands that they surrender, and the Taliban rejected Jamiat's offer to join a peaceful political process leading towards a general election. In March 1995, Massoud handed the Taliban their first major loss, however, with the aid of Saudi and Pakistani backing, they regrouped and launched and offensive in mid-1996. Massoud ordered the retreat of his troops among them Jamiat to avoid another bloodbath.\n\nFollowing the capture of Kabul by the Taliban, the major mujahideen factions put aside their feuds and formed the United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan (the United Front), commonly known in the west as the Northern Alliance, with Rabbani, officially becoming its political leader. Other Jamiat members took up senior positions within the United Front government: Yunus Qanuni served as Interior Minister and Dr. Abdullah became Foreign Minister, for example.\n\nOn 9 September 2001, just two days before the September 11 attacks in the United States, Massoud was assassinated by two suicide bombers, probably at the instigation of al-Qaeda. Immediately afterwards Taliban forces launched a major offensive against United Front positions. Mohammed Qasim Fahim was chosen to succeed Massoud as leader of Jamiat's military wing and repulsed the Taliban offensive. With extensive assistance from an American-led coalition in October and November 2001 (see War in Afghanistan (2001–present)), United Front forces recaptured most of Afghanistan.\n\nJamiat's founder and leader, Burhanuddin Rabbani, was assassinated in 2011. His son, Salahuddin Rabbani, has since led the party.\n\n"}

Laurel and Hardy play dual roles as their own children. It also inspired a helper group for the Michigan tent for The Sons of the Desert, which is composed of all the child members of the tent. This is the first of only three films where the boys each play a dual role: the second is Twice Two and the third and last is Our Relations.\n\nLaurel and Hardy are spending a night in with the kids. The fathers are playing checkers and pool, but are constantly distracted by their own incompetence and by their children, who are constantly bullying each other and trying to stay up late.\nThe film begins with Stan and Ollie playing a game of checkers, and Stan Jr. and Ollie Jr. playing with blocks. They smash a vase and are sent to bed. Ollie Jr. is pushed into a full bath and chases Stan Jr. out (leaving the taps and the shower on), but slips on the soap causing part of the ceiling to crash onto the pool table. Stan and Ollie are furious and rush upstairs, only to find their junior versions in bed pretending to be asleep. When both boys ask for a drink of water, Oliver opens the door to the by-now flooded bathroom, and the water gushes out from the bathroom in a torrent, bowling them over in a drenched heap as the film ends.\n\n\n\"Brats\" was one of four Laurel and Hardy sound shorts reissued in 1937. At that time, new background music scores by Leroy Shield that were used in many 1937 Hal Roach films were added. The films reissued that way were \"Blotto\", \"County Hospital\" and \"Perfect Day\". Additionally, \"Brats\"' introductory title (\"Mr. Laurel and Mr. Hardy remained at home to take care of the children---\"/\"Their wives had gone out for target practice--\") was eliminated from the reissue prints.\n\nThis is one of just two shorts to feature only Stan and Ollie in the cast; the other is the 1928 silent \"Early to Bed\". It is also the only film in which they play natural fathers.\n\nThe illusion of Laurel and Hardy as children was achieved using oversized furniture. Each room of the house was re-created in large scale to achieve the effect of both duos being in the same house. Doors and staircases had to be duplicated to appear as though the \"children\" were child-size. The \"children\" are as tall as a doorknob and a sink and Stan Jr must use a stepstool to reach the tub's taps, the tub seeming more like a small pool. Ollie Jr's bulk causes him to crash through some dresser drawers.\n\nThe mouse that Stan Jr. nearly shoots with a pellet gun was animated.\n\n"}

The school's motto is 'Free to Build'.\n\nIt was founded in 1907 as an interdenominational Multi-faith school and today educates over a thousand pupils from pre-primary (3 years) to high school (grade 12). The school is part of ISASA (the Independent Schools Association of Southern Africa) and matriculants write the South African IEB examinations. In 2018 the school will also be introducing the IB (International Baccalaureate) Diploma Program as an optional parallel program to the IEB.\n\nThe school is divided into a Redhill Early Learning Center, Redhill Preparatory School and Redhill High School. All three schools share a campus and many facilities. Redhill offers two curriculum in high school IEB & IB programs that offer students more choice. \n\nRed Radio (redradio.caster.fm) is a committee within Redhill, giving students the medium to express themselves.\n\nIn 1941, Catherine Hill became the Headmistress with a bold vision to completely transform and revitalise the school's image, both physically and in the name. “St Winifred’s School for Girls” became “Redhill School”, named for the Headmistress and the vibrant colour of the new uniforms. It was here that the “Redhill Family” with the new “Free to Build” motto, was born.\n\nThe ‘new’ school had a total of 68 pupils, 34 in each of the junior and high schools, later rising to 129 with the support of Director, Mr L Guittard, staff, parents and pupils. \n\nTowards the end of 1941, when many young mothers went to work during the war effort, Redhill opened a Nursery School, which was soon to become the first independent nursery school that was up to government standards in those days.\n\nAs a result of financial difficulties, Catherine Hill sought out more affordable premises for the school, finally settling on a group of rondavels in Morningside. To raise funds, Redhill School was registered as a company on 6 April 1946, and it was at this time that many parents agreed to serve on the board of directors.\n\nAmidst crippling financial troubles, Catherine Hill (who had remarried to become Catherine Rodda) handed over the reins of leadership to Deputy Principal, Dorothy Thompson. Despite these difficulties, this was also a time of optimism for the school as pupil numbers continued to increase and educational standards improved vastly.\n\nElements of the curriculum could be seen as almost revolutionary, given the times and the conservative nature of education under the National Party. Despite the restricted quota system on pupils of colour, to qualify for a government grant, the school was not prepared to impose this quota and claimed to be an “undenominational school… that endeavours to build religious tolerance and mutual respect among individuals and groups with differing points of view”.\n\nAs financial difficulties continued, the governors approached Dr Isaac Kriel, the principal and majority shareholder of the Damelin Group, to take over the ownership and management of the school, and in 1968, Redhill School officially came under the guidance of the Damelin Group in a widely publicised deal worth R300 000.\n\nFrom that point, Redhill underwent fundamental changes under the leadership of these dedicated educationists. From a girls’ school of 150 pupils, the numbers would increase over the next ten years to 630, including boys. Major progress would be made towards achieving academic excellence through a more traditional and rigorous approach to education. Dr Kriel and Mr Witt brought some excellent new teachers to Redhill from Damelin.\n\nChange was constant at Redhill during this time, and while stricter, more formal policies were put into place, many of the core values would remain deeply entrenched. In 1969, Margaret Landers became the new Headmistress and brought with her some much-needed stability to the changing school dynamic with a stricter and more formal approach to education. During this time, Dr Kriel and Mr Witt recognised that co-education was “in keeping with modern educational principles, and enjoyed worldwide acceptance”, and so in 1974, the first boys entered the Primary School.\n\nIn January 1975, the school year opened under the leadership of William Harrison, who was the first Headmaster in the school's history. \n\nFollowing a decision by Dr Kriel and Mr Witt to depart from Redhill, the school came under the care of a Trust, which was registered in July 1979, and a Board of Trustees under the Chairmanship of Mr PB Oertel came into being.\n\nDuring this time, continuity in leadership created problems for the school until Jeremy Barnes was appointed as Headmaster in 1984 and the school came under the control of a truly dedicated and forward-thinking educationist. Roger Briggs was appointed in 1983 as the Principal of the Preparatory School and Jenny Stead took on the leadership of the nursery school. This core of dedicated leaders was well placed to take Redhill through the next decade of change.\n\nDuring the course of the 1980s, a number of black students were admitted into Redhill and a scholarship scheme was established to provide scholarships for them despite laws restricting black children from attending what was considered by the government as a ‘whites only’ school. Another crucial cornerstone of Redhill's progressive educational philosophy was the notion of religious tolerance.\n\nAfter the departure of Roger Briggs and Jeremy Barnes, Ben Brooks was appointed as the new Headmaster, with Brian Mitchell taking over as the Principal of the Preparatory school, inheriting Redhill at a time when the country was about to enter the most significant period of change in its history.\n\nAs a result of a period of sustained stability, over the next decade, the school would be significantly remodelled in the most extensive and sustained building programme in its history. One of the key decisions made under Ben Brooks was to replace the state exam with the new IEB exam.\n\nThe park like campus is dominated by red-brick buildings with green corrugated iron roofing. The oldest buildings on the campus are a set of thatched rondavels in a typical African style.\n\nhttps://www.redhill.co.za/about/history\n"}

He only produced two etchings, one of which dates from 1513 – the earliest known etching for which a date has been established. However, his woodcuts are considered of greater significance, particularly as he is attributed with the invention of the white-line woodcut technique, where white lines create the image on a black background. He also produced a few engravings, including copies of works by Martin Schongauer and Albrecht Dürer. He produced innovative drawings intended as finished works of art rather than just studies.\n\nGraf learned goldsmithing first from his father, Hugo Graf, then from a goldsmith in Zürich. He continued to work as a goldsmith and a few pieces survive. He initially earned money as a designer of woodcut book illustrations and by assisting a stained glass painter. In 1512, he bought citizenship in Basel and became a member of the goldsmiths' guild. He quickly came into conflict with the law for abusing his wife and consorting with prostitutes, culminating in accusations of attempted murder which caused him to flee the city in 1518. He was allowed to return to Basel the following year, where he continued working, but after 1527 his life becomes unclear. Given his frequent employment as a soldier of fortune it is possible he was present at the sack of Rome. Christiane Andersson noted that, \"When and where he died are unknown: his wife remarried in October 1528 but an autograph drawing is dated 1529\".\n\nLike many Swiss men of his day, Graf was known to have worked as a mercenary for considerable periods. His artistic output, arising from the tradition of Albrecht Dürer and Hans Baldung, includes a wide range of subjects, depicting social, erotic, military, political, and criminal images (e.g., \"Two Prostitutes Beating a Monk\"), as well as strong religious feelings which emerge in some works.\n\n\n"}

He became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1857 and was licenced in 1858.\n\nHis taste for the stage - he had taken part in amateur drama - was too strong for him to take up either the clerical or the medical career suggested for him. His first appearances on stage were for Sir Hugh Lyon Playfair's private theatre in St Andrews.\n\nEarly in 1862 he made his first professional appearance in London, performing with Ellen Terry. Later in the year he went to America and since further stage work was not forthcoming, he returned to medicine. There was a shortage of surgeons in the United States, which was in the throes of the Civil War, and he volunteered to become brigade surgeon in the Union army. He served at the battles of Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville and Gettysburg.\n\nOn 17 November 1864 he resigned his contract with the Army to return to the stage. He starred, in 1867, in W. S. Gilbert's \"La Vivandière\". In later years he was to appear in America: between 1870 and 1872 in his own \"Wyndham Comedy Company\"; and in later tours between 1882 and 1909. On one occasion he appeared in New York City with John Wilkes Booth. He acted also in German.\n\nReturning to England, his career blossomed. Although he was occasionally to play Shakespeare, his work mostly consisted of the popular melodramas and comedies of the time. He played at Manchester and Dublin in \"Her Ladyship's Guardian\", his own adaptation of Edward B. Hamley's novel \"Lady Lee's Widowhood\". He reappeared in London in 1866 as Sir Arthur Lascelles in Morion's \"All that Glitters is not Gold\", but his great success at that time was in F. C. Burnand's burlesque of \"Black-eyed Susan\", as Hatchett, \"with dance.\" This brought him to the erstwhile St James's Theatre, where he played with Henry Irving in \"Idalia\"; then with Ellen Terry in Charles Reade's \"Double Marriage\", and Tom Taylor's \"Still Waters Run Deep\".\n\nAs Charles Surface, his best part for many years, and in a breezy three-act farce, \"The Pink Dominos\", by James Albery, and in \"Brighton\", an anglicized version of \"Saratoga\" by Bronson Howard (1842–1908), who married his sister, he added greatly to his popularity both at home and abroad. In 1876 he took control of the Criterion Theatre. Here he produced a long succession of plays, in which he took the leading part, notably a number of old English comedies, and in such modern plays as \"The Liars\", \"The Case of Rebellious Susan\" and others by Henry Arthur Jones and \"Foggerty's Fairy\" by W. S. Gilbert (1881); and he became famous for his acting in \"David Garrick\". In the fall of 1882 he returned to America where he was given a celebratory dinner in his honor at which Oscar Wilde gave a speech.\n\nWilde became a friend to Wyndham and in 1895 contracted with him to produce his play The Importance of Being Earnest at the Criterion Theatre before it was transferred for its first performance at the St. James' Theatre. In 1899 he opened his new theatre, called Wyndham's Theatre. From 1885 onwards his leading actress was Miss Mary Moore (Mrs. Albery), who became his partner in the proprietorship of the Criterion and Wyndham's theatres, and of his New Theatre, opened in 1903; and her delightful acting in comedy made their long association memorable on the London stage.\n\nHe was knighted in the 1902 Coronation Honours, receiving the accolade from King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 24 October that year.\n\nIn 1860 he married Emma Silberrad, the granddaughter of Baron Silberrad of Hesse-Darmstadt. They had one son and one daughter both of whom survived him. When his first wife died in 1916, in the same year he married Mary Moore (widow of the dramatist James Albery), youngest daughter of Charles Moore, parliamentary agent. Mary had been his leading lady for 30 years and had also been associated with him as a manager of his theatres. Charles Wyndham died on 12 January 1919, from pneumonia following influenza, and is buried with both wives in Hampstead Cemetery.\n\n\n\n"}

He has also been a speechwriter for President Jimmy Carter and editor of \"The New Republic\", and is the author of \"¡Obámanos! The Rise of a New Political Era\" and \"Politics: Observations & Arguments\". In 2009, \"Forbes\" named Hertzberg one of the \"25 Most Influential Liberals in the U.S. Media,\" placing him at number seventeen.\n\nHertzberg was born in Manhattan, New York City, the son of Hazel Manross (née Whitman), a professor of history and education at Columbia University, and Sidney Hertzberg, a journalist and political activist. His father was Jewish (and had become an atheist); his mother was a Quaker with a Congregationalist background and of English descent, also a great-grandniece of Walt Whitman. Hertzberg was educated in the public schools of Rockland County, New York, and Harvard College, from which he graduated in 1965.\n\nHertzberg graduated from Suffern High School in Suffern, New York, after a semester as an exchange student in Toulouse, France.\n\nHe began his writing career at \"The Harvard Crimson\" and eventually served as managing editor including writing on local and national politics. In addition, he was president of the Liberal Union, had a jazz program on WHRB, and belonged to the Signet Society. Consumed by his Crimson duties, Hertzberg landed on academic probation for a semester, which required him to withdraw from all extracurricular activities. He managed to continue to write Crimson pieces anyway, under the pseudonym Sidney Hart.\n\nWilliam Shawn, the editor of the \"New Yorker\", invited Hertzberg to talk about writing for the magazine. Shawn was familiar with Hertzberg's writing because his son—the actor Wallace Shawn—was a classmate of Hertzberg's at Harvard. Hertzberg declined the invitation and after graduating from Harvard in 1965 he took a draft-deferred position as editorial director for the U.S. National Student Association. The following year he joined the San Francisco bureau of \"Newsweek\" as a reporter. Hertzberg covered the rise of the hippies, the emergence of rock groups such as the Grateful Dead, Ronald Reagan's successful campaign for governor of California, and The Beatles' last concert.\n\nIn 1967 he enlisted in the United States Navy and became an officer posted in New York City. By late 1968 due to his growing opposition to the Vietnam War he requested conscientious-objector status, which was denied. He was discharged at the end of his commitment in 1969. From 1969 to 1977 Hertzberg was a staff writer for the \"New Yorker\"; \"Spy magazine\" characterized him during this period of his career as a \"lothario.\" \n\nDuring the 1976 election, Hertzberg wrote speeches for Governor Hugh Carey of New York. After the election, he was recruited to join Carter's speech writing team by James Fallows. After Fallows departed in 1979, Hertzberg became Carter's chief speechwriter. Hertzberg was an author of President Jimmy Carter's July 15, 1979, speech on energy conservation, widely known as the \"Malaise Speech\" and critiqued as one of the most ineffective pieces of political rhetoric in American history. The reaction by some Americans, who were suffering from high unemployment and an American industrial economy in severe recession, was that President Carter blamed them for the economic problems they were facing when they believed that Carter himself was ineffective in alleviating the recession. Others, however, point out that calls and letters to the White House were overwhelmingly positive, and that Carter's approval rating in polls climbed 11 points. Vice President Walter Mondale predicted that the speech would not be well received. Hertzberg's personal favorite speech is Carter's farewell address of January 14, 1981. It opens with Carter declaring that he leaves the White House \"to take up once more the only title in our democracy superior to that of President, the title of citizen.\"\n\nAs a liberal author, he also expostulates on the necessity of humanism and secularism in democratic societies and critiques the Conservative Revolution. Hertzberg believes that America’s system of winner-take-all elections, federalism, and separation of powers is out of date and damaging to political responsibility and democratic accountability.\n\nHertzberg is a frequent guest on television programs, such as \"Democracy Now!\". In 2004, Hertzberg contributed $2,000 to John Kerry.\n\nHertzberg was twice editor of \"The New Republic\", from 1981 to 1985 and then from 1989 to 1992, alternating in that job with Michael Kinsley. In between his stints as editor he wrote for that and other magazines and was a fellow at two institutes at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government: the Institute of Politics and the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics, and Public Policy. Under his editorship \"The New Republic\" twice won the National Magazine Award for General Excellence, the magazine world’s highest honor.\n\nIn 1992, when Tina Brown became editor of \"The New Yorker\", she recruited Hertzberg as her executive editor, and he helped her redesign and revitalize the magazine. Under Brown's successor, David Remnick, Hertzberg was a senior editor and staff writer and was a main contributor to \"Comment,\" the weekly essay on politics and society in \"The Talk of the Town\" and continued until early 2014. In 2006, his articles won \"The New Yorker\" a National Magazine Award for Columns and Commentary, and in five other years (2003, -4, -8, -9 and -11) earned the magazine a Finalist ranking in the awards. From 1995 to 2018, Hertzberg was a board member of FairVote, an electoral reform organization, and continues on its advisory committee.\n\n\n\nHertzberg is married to Virginia Cannon, a former \"Vanity Fair\" editor and a current \"New Yorker\" editor. They have a son, Wolf.\n\n"}

Cape May, Cape May County, and the city of Cape May, New Jersey, are named after him.\n\nCornelius May is said to be from the city of Hoorn but may have been born in the small village of Schellinkhout, just east of Hoorn, as he appears to have been the brother of Jan Jacobszoon May van Schellinkhout, after whom the island of Jan Mayen is named. Both brothers were the cousin of, in his day, a far more famous sailor, Jan Cornelisz May, who led several expeditions to explore the Northeast passage and between 1614 and 1617 circumnavigated the world with Joris van Spilbergen.\n\nMay sailed first in the \"Mauritius River\" or \"Hudson's river\" (so referred to first by Adriaen Block in 1613) in 1614 where an agreement was made among various competing traders. On October 11, 1614, May became a party to the New Netherland Company which received an exclusive patent from the States General for four voyages to be undertaken for three years to territories discovered between the 40th and 45th parallels at the exclusion of all other Dutch (until January 1618).\n\nFrom August until November 1616, the company tried unsuccessfully to obtain a new patent for a territory situated between the 38th and 40th parallels (i.e., the Delaware Bay area) which in 1614, and 1615 had been surveyed by Cornelis Hendricksz from Monnikendam on the ship \"Onrust\". In 1616 Cornelis Hendricksen, sailed the \"Onrust\" up the Zuyd Rivier (literally \"South River,\" today known as the Delaware River) from its bay to its northernmost navigable reaches, on a voyage to ransom three fur traders taken from Fort Nassau on the North River.\n\nOn behalf of the successor company of the New Netherland Company, Cornelius Jacobsen May had explored and surveyed the Delaware Bay on the ship named \"Blijde Boodschap\" (en. \"Joyful Message\") from which he carried on trade with the Indians there in 1620. In 1621, he ordered the construction of factorij of Fort Nassau at the mouth of the Big Timber Creek.\n\nTwo of the six business partners of the ships \"Blijde Boodschap\" and \"Bever\" which focused on exploration and trade in the Zuidt Rivier or Delaware River, were Thijmen Jacobsz Hinlopen and Samuel Godijn. Cape Hinlopen, now spelled Cape Henlopen in Delaware is named after the former. Cape Hinlopen was New Netherland's most southern border on the 38th parallel. Samuel Godyn had Godyn's Bay named after him, now renamed Delaware Bay. Also spelled Godijn or Godin, he was one of the first patroons in New Netherland as well as a director of the West India Company and of the Northern Company.\n\nMay was unable to trade in the South River (Delaware River) to the exclusion of competing Dutch companies. Though the competing Dutch companies were eventually able to reach agreement in New Netherland, discord arose again which was settled, finally, by a judgment of arbitrators at Amsterdam on December 23, 1623. The 38th and 39th parallels region came under the final jurisdiction of the Dutch West India Company with the delivery of the first settlers to New Netherland in 1624, mostly Walloon and Flemish families. May was the captain of the ship \"New Netherland\" who delivered the first boat load of colonists to New Netherland, first at Fort Orange, the trading post near present-day Albany, and then on Governors Island, in present-day NYC, that year. In the spring of 1624, Cornelius Jacobsen May returned to New Netherlands in command of the \"Nieu Nederlandt\", with the first group of settlers, mostly young Walloon families. Some were sent to company lands in Connecticut, while two families and eight single males took a sloop to the Zuidt (South) River, now the Delaware River, and established Fort Wilhelmus. Eight men were also left on Nut Island to promote the fur trade, and the remaining eighteen families proceeded upriver to Fort Orange. Having so transformed the New Netherland territory to a province, he was named the province's first director.\n\n"}

Stations fitting this description existed in the mid-1920s. Little is recorded about these stations, but like other low-powered stations of the era, their programming would tend to be sporadic, with music and readings performed live by the station's performers – the era of playing records would not be established until the 1950s. The combination of the Great Depression of the early 1930s and new restrictions enacted by the Federal Communications Commission forced all of the high school stations off the air by 1934.\n\nIt would be until the late 1940s, with the advent of the 88–108 MHz FM radio band that renewed interest was shown in HS radio. Because the 88-92 MHz region was dedicated to non-commercial broadcasting, this allowed for schools to fairly easily obtain licenses from the FCC. The oldest HS station on FM is WNAS in New Albany, Indiana, which started broadcasting in May 1949. The station is still broadcasting today. WHHS, Haverford Senior High School's radio station also started in 1949, located in Havertown, Pennsylvania. As the FM band increased in listenership in the next few decades, the number of HS stations increased with it. By the 1970s, there were over 150 HS stations across the country. In addition to this number, there have always been untold numbers of unlicensed stations using carrier current (popular through the 1970s), extremely low power or \"Part 15\" stations, and closed circuit broadcasting. Many of the licensed stations are assigned to suburban school districts in a few large metro areas: Chicago, Indianapolis, Detroit, Boston, Philadelphia, Seattle and to a lesser extent San Francisco and Cleveland. There have historically been very few H.S. stations in the Southeast.\n\nWhile some HS stations became important training grounds for students who would go on to careers in broadcasting, the perception of HS stations as poorly programmed and supervised helped contribute to the downfall of many stations. After a steady decline in their numbers in the 1980s and '90s, the availability of LPFM licenses has renewed interest in HS radio, at least in rural areas where the LPFM license is most readily available.\n\nToday's HS stations, particularly in rural areas, serve as de facto community radio stations when classes are not in session.\n\nMany HS stations were first licensed in the 1970s on the FM band, just as the band was beginning to fill up and become crowded in many cities. As a result, HS stations tended to be low-powered (under one kilowatt) in most instances.\n\n\nThe John Drury Awards are a national competition for high school radio students. The Drury categories include Best Newscast, Best Promotional Announcement, Best Sports Play-by-Play, and Best Public Service Announcement. The awards are held each May annually. The awards luncheon and ceremony is hosted by North Central College in Naperville, Illinois, just outside Chicago. The awards began as a small enterprise, but have grown each year with entries from stations in Michigan, Connecticut, Illinois, Tennessee, Iowa, and more. They are named in memory of John Drury, a television news anchorman from Chicago, IL.\n\nThe individual record for most awards won was set in 2007 by Wade Fink. Fink won seven awards, and had more points individually than any other station had total.\n\nPoints are awarded for each win in one of the ten categories. The station with the most points at the end of the ceremony wins \"Station of the Year\". The previous Station of the Year award winners are:\n\n\nThe 2009–2010 award nominations were announced in September 2010.

Located at Salisbury Road, it was built by the former Urban Council and, since 2000, has been administered by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department of the Hong Kong Government. A wide variety of cultural performances are held here.\n\nThe centre is located on the southwestern tip of Tsim Sha Tsui, on the former location of the Kowloon Station of the Kowloon-Canton Railway. Adjacent to the centre on the west is the Tsim Sha Tsui Ferry Pier of the Star Ferry, while to the east are the Hong Kong Space Museum and Hong Kong Museum of Art. The historic Clock Tower stands between the centre and the pier.\n\nAs early as 1970, the Urban Council pressed for construction of a new cultural venue in Kowloon of the same modern standard as the City Hall in Central. The cultural centre project was formally announced in 1974 to be planned on the site of the former Kowloon Station. At this time, construction was expected to begin in 1975. However, the project faced financial constraints and was delayed. It was reexamined in 1978 and given top priority by the Urban Council, but cost estimates rose from $190 million to $474 million and the project was again shelved for some time. When construction finally began, the demolition of the historic railway station occupying the site was extremely controversial.\n\nThe centre was designed by then-Public Works Department chief architect José Lei. Originally operated by the Urban Council, the venue was officially opened in a ceremony on 8 November 1989 officiated by Charles, Prince of Wales and Princess Diana, who unveiled a commemorative plaque. The $10 million Rieger Orgelbau organ was installed from August to November in 1989 and involved the complicated installation of 8,000 pipes.\n\nThe cultural centre opened with the International Celebration of the Arts, a special programme that ran from 5 November to 6 December and showcased Hong Kong musicians, Kunju opera, Cantonese music, and performances by a range of international artists including the Cologne Opera, the Alban Berg Quartett, Sadao Watanabe, and the first Hong Kong appearance of guitarist John Williams.\n\n\nThe centre is adjacent to the Star Ferry Pier and the Star Ferry bus terminus served by Kowloon Motor Bus.\n\nIt is also within walking distance to Tsim Sha Tsui Station and East Tsim Sha Tsui Station, which serve the Tsuen Wan Line and West Rail Line respectively.\n\n\n"}

The film won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment, the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Film, and was screened at the International Film Festival of India. The film was remade in Kannada as \"Sathyameva Jayathe\" with Devaraj and in Telugu as \"Astram\" (2006) with Vishnu Manchu and Anushka Shetty.\n\nArms trafficking is taking place in India. An arsenal enters Indian territory via the state of Rajasthan, which makes its way to interior of India with help of many middlemen. Bala Thakur, a gun handler in Chandrapur, provides the arms to Veeran, a forest dwelling brigand. Later, Veeran and his gang attack a wedding bus, mercilessly gunning down every person in it which includes women and children. The government appoints a Special Action Team in Mumbai to trace the roots behind the attack. The team learns about Bala Thakur, but thanks to his informants, Thakur flees before he can be apprehended.\n\nMeanwhile, ACP Ajay Singh Rathore (Aamir Khan), a resident of Mumbai, is attending a concert by the famed ghazal singer Gulfam Hassan (Naseeruddin Shah), a Muhajir, where he spots a familiar face, Seema (Sonali Bendre). Ajay had a crush over Seema when they were studying in Delhi, but never got the courage to propose to her. The duo are happy to meet each other again and gradually fall in love. Gulfam, on the other hand, is Indian by birth, but had to move to Pakistan as a child during partition. Deeply scarred due to the experience, he is still happy that the Government allows him to live in his palatial residence whenever he comes to India. Gulfam finds a huge fan in Ajay, who used to attend his programs as a child. Despite the age difference, the two bond.\n\nInspector Salim (Mukesh Rishi) a Muslim inspector is taken off from the Special Action Team when a notorious gangster Sultan(Pradeep Rawat) escapes his clutches and he is severely reprimanded by his superior for this failure and for causing the death of three other officers in the attempt. Despite being an honest and upright police officer with the best intelligence gathering network in the force, Salim is rueful that he is being given second class treatment because he is a Muslim and is being perceived as having let Sultan escape because he was a Muslim as well. His anger at the system doesn't lessen when Ajay, though an IPS officer but younger and inexperienced, is told to head the team. Ajay wants Salim on the team unofficially as he has good network of informants, but Salim refuses. It is revealed that Ajay's father was going to testify against some terrorist who had threatened him not to testify, but in an attempt to stop them from doing so, Ajay's elder brother was killed. Ajay's father was kidnapped and by the time the terrorists spared him, the man had lost his voice. This motivated Ajay to join the police force.\n\nUnknown to Ajay, Gulfam is also working for the Pakistani intelligence which is attempting to create havoc in India and indulge in a proxy war with India. Since Gulfam likes Ajay, he sees to it that nothing untoward happens to him. Here, Salim finds the location of Bala Thakur along with the information that Sultan, the man who escaped from his clutches, will also be there. Salim gives the information to Ajay who makes peace with Salim and convinces him to join the team again. An encounter at the criminals' rendezvous results in the death of Bala Thakur and Ajay is seriously injured. Though Sultan and his right-hand man Shiva manage to escape, the operation is deemed a success as the team is able to intercept a large consignment of lethal arms and ammunition meant for terrorist Veeran and his terrorist acts around the country. Sultan is later assassinated on Gulfams orders because of his failure and false information is leaked that he has escaped to Pakistan.\n\nWhile recuperating, Ajay has an epiphany which leads the team to Bahid in Rajasthan and to \"Mirchi Seth\" Rambandhu Gupta(Akhilendra Mishra). The investigative team save for Ajay and Salim camp in Bahid and gather all possible information on Mirchi Seth. Ajay comes over to Bahid to investigate and meets Gulfam who is temporarily staying in his ancestral manor near Bahid. Gulfam attempts to derail the investigation through political means and ordering an assault on Ajay to subvert the investigation, but of no avail. The repeated failures on Gulfam's part displease the senior officers in Pakistani Intelligence, who dispatch Major Aslam Baig to take care of the business.\n\nHere, Ajay goes through the information collected so far and realises that he has seen many key suspects near Gulfam, but fails to make the connection. The investigative team prepares for a final assault on the gun-running operation and in the pursuit of Mirchi Seth land up at Gulfam's mansion. Ajay feels betrayed when he learns of Gulfam's treachery, but is aware of lack of substantial evidence to indict Gulfam for his crimes. He goads and tricks Gulfam into killing Baig and arrests him for the offence. After realising what happened, Gulfam reveals how the incidents that happened during the partition embittered him and why he did those deeds.\n\nIn retaliation, Ajay makes him realise that his actions are not benefiting people of any religion. After Ajay makes him see the error in his ways, Gulfam, unable to stand the humiliation and guilt, commits suicide. Gulfam's suicide is hushed up and the team returns triumphant to Mumbai to much accolades for busting the terrorist racket. At Mumbai Airport, Salim is tipped on the whereabouts of Veeran and Ajay embarks on another investigation with his team.\n\nUpon theatrical release, \"Sarfarosh\" received highly positive reviews by the critics. Naseeruddin Shah was specially praised for his role of a Muhajir. The reviewer for \"Filmfare\" rated the film four stars out of five and wrote, \"What makes this film so exceptional is its carefully thought out characterization and brilliant performances. Although this is his first film, director John Mathew Matthan draws perfectly crafted outputs from his entire cast. Aamir brings the role of A.C.P. Rathod to a never-before-seen dimension of reality.\" He further added, \"Sarfarosh succeeds in connecting with the audiences, as it manages to transcend its medium and do a great deal more than just entertain.\" Suparn Verma of \"Rediff.com\" felt that the film \"manages to marry serious cinema with the commercial variety\" and wrote that the \"script has this no-nonsense look to it, clearly and succinctly establishing the protagonist's past ...\" In addition to commending the acting performances of Naseeruddin Shah, Aamir Khan and Sonali Bendre, he lauded the departments of direction, music, choreography, and called the camerawork \"good in parts but lack[ing] technical finesse\".\nThe film is now regarded as cult classic. \n\n\n\nThe film's music was composed by Jatin Lalit. Lyrics are penned by Israr Ansari, Nida Fazli, Sameer, and Indeevar.\n\n"}
{"id": "2163238", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2163238", "title": "Mel Bradford", "text": "Mel Bradford\n\nMelvin E. \"Mel\" Bradford (May 8, 1934 – March 3, 1993) was a conservative political commentator and professor of literature at the University of Dallas.\n\nBradford is seen as a leading figure of the paleoconservative wing of the conservative movement. He died just as the term \"paleoconservative\" was being coined and preferred the term traditional conservative. In his preface to \"Reactionary Imperative\", he wrote \"Reaction is a necessary term in the intellectual context we inhabit in the twentieth century because merely to conserve is sometimes to perpetuate what is outrageous.\"\n\nBradford's conservatism was rooted within the heritage and traditions of the American South. He studied at Vanderbilt University and wrote his doctoral thesis under the Southern Agrarian and Fugitive Poet Donald Davidson (whose biography Bradford was wrapping up at the time of his sudden death at age 58), and thus was admitted to the succession of this movement to recover the Southern tradition.\n\nBradford was first and foremost a literary scholar and a student of rhetoric. He was known in literary circles for his work on William Faulkner, where Bradford stressed the importance of the Southern setting and the primacy of community in understanding the action of Faulkner's novels and stories. He \"had no truck with critical efforts to portray Faulkner as alienated from the South. To the contrary, he saw the novelist as thoroughly embedded within his native region.\" Outside of literature he wrote extensively on the subjects of history and culture. Bradford specialized in the history of the American founding and Southern history in the United States. Bradford also advocated the constitutional theory of strict constructionism. \"The original understanding of the Constitution, Bradford maintained, conformed much more closely to the Southern position than to Lincoln's acts of usurpation.\"\n\nBradford also frequently wrote for \"Modern Age\", \"Chronicles magazine\" and \"Southern Partisan\" magazine.\n\nBradford was born in Fort Worth, Texas and grew up there. He studied English at University of Oklahoma and completed his bachelor's and master's degrees. He then continued his education at Vanderbilt University and graduated with a Ph.D. He stayed in academia and taught at several institutions of higher education, including United States Naval Academy, Northwestern State University of Louisiana, and, primarily, the University of Dallas from 1967 until his death.\n\nIn U.S. presidential elections Bradford campaigned for Barry Goldwater in 1964, George C. Wallace in 1972, Ronald Reagan in 1976 and 1980, and Pat Buchanan in 1992.\n\nHe was for a time the President of the Philadelphia Society.\n\nHe died in 1993 after undergoing heart surgery.\n\nIn 1980, Dr. Bradford was initially tapped by President-elect Ronald Reagan for chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities. According to David Gordon, \"Reagan's wish to elevate him to the prestigious post did not stem solely from Bradford's academic credentials. The president and he were acquaintances, and he had worked hard in Reagan's campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. Influential conservatives such as Russell Kirk and Sen. Jesse Helms also knew and admired Bradford.\" The selection met with intense objections from neoconservative figures, centering partly on Bradford's criticisms of President Abraham Lincoln. They circulated quotes of Bradford calling Lincoln \"a dangerous man,\" and saying, \"The image of Lincoln rose to be very dark\" and \"indeed almost sinister.\" He was even accused of comparing Lincoln to Adolf Hitler. \"Bradford rejected Lincoln because he saw him as a revolutionary, intent on replacing the American Republic established by the Constitution with a centralized and leveling despotism.\" Another issue was Bradford's support for the 1972 presidential campaign of George C. Wallace. The neoconservative choice, William Bennett, was substituted for Bradford on November 13, 1981.\n\nA letter supporting Bradford's nomination, sent to President Reagan during the controversy, was signed by John East, Jesse Helms, John Tower, Strom Thurmond, Orrin Hatch, Jeremiah Denton, Dan Quayle and James McClure and eight other Republican senators. Gerhart Niemeyer, Russell Kirk, Jeffrey Hart, William Buckley, M. Stanton Evans, Andrew Lytle, Harry Jaffa (\"Bradford's principal intellectual antagonist\"), and \"dozens of others\" were also named as supporters. Norman Podhoretz, Irving Kristol, William Kristol, Michael Joyce and William Simon were among Bennett's supporters.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2163239", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2163239", "title": "United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti", "text": "United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti\n\nThe United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti (UNSTAMIH) (), also known as MINUSTAH, an acronym of the French name, was a UN peacekeeping mission in Haiti that was in operation from 2004 to 2017. The mission's military component was led by the Brazilian Army and the force commander was Brazilian. The force was composed of 2,366 military personnel and 2,533 police, supported by international civilian personnel, a local civilian staff and United Nations Volunteers.\n\nFollowing the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the United Nations reported that the headquarters of the mission in Port-au-Prince had collapsed and that the mission's chief, Hédi Annabi of Tunisia, his deputy Luiz Carlos da Costa of Brazil, and the acting police commissioner, RCMP Supt. Doug Coates of Canada, were confirmed dead. On 14 January 2010, UN headquarters dispatched the former head of MINUSTAH and current Assistant Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, Edmond Mulet, as the organisation's Acting Special Representative of the Secretary-General and interim head of MINUSTAH.\nMulet clarified on 22 January 2010 that MINUSTAH would concentrate on assisting the Haitian National Police in providing security within the country after the earthquake, while American and Canadian military forces will distribute humanitarian aid and provide security for aid distribution.\n\nMINUSTAH's mandate was extended by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1944 past its deadline of 15 October 2010 amid alleged fears of instability. The mission's mandate was then extended until 15 October 2012 with the intention and has been renewed periodically.\n\nOn 13 April 2017, the United Nations Security Council announced that the mission will end in October 2017. It is set to be replaced by a follow-up mission: the United Nations Mission for Justice Support in Haiti (MINUJUSTH), which is expected to have just under 1,300 personnel.\n\nAccording to its mandate from the UN Security Council, MINUSTAH is required to concentrate the use of its resources, including civilian police, on increasing security and protection during the electoral period and to assist with the restoration and maintenance of the rule of law, public safety and public order in Haiti. MINUSTAH was established by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1542 on 30 April 2004 because the Security Council deemed the situation in Haiti to be a threat to international peace and security in the region. In 2004, UN peacekeepers entered Cité Soleil in an attempt to gain control of the area and end the anarchy.\n\nIn 2004, independent human rights organizations accused the Haitian National Police (HNP) and sometimes MINUSTAH of atrocities against civilians. It is still argued if any, or how many civilians were killed as a by-product of MINUSTAH crackdowns on criminals operating from slums. The UN and MINUSTAH expressed deep regret for any loss of life during operations.\n\nIn early 2005, MINUSTAH force commander Lieutenant-General (page in Portuguese) testified at a congressional commission in Brazil that \"we are under extreme pressure from the international community to use violence\", citing Canada, France, and the United States. Having ended his tour of duty, on 1 September 2005, Heleno was replaced by General Urano Teixeira da Matta Bacellar as force commander of MINUSTAH. On 7 January 2006, Bacellar was found dead in his hotel room. The death was considered to be suicide, however later some suspicion of assassination arose. His interim replacement was Chilean General Eduardo Aldunate Hermann.\n\nOn 17 January 2006, it was announced that Brazilian General José Elito Carvalho Siqueira would be the permanent replacement for Bacellar as the head of the United Nations' Haiti force.\n\nOn 14 February 2006, in its Resolution 1658, the United Nations Security Council extended MINUSTAH's mandate until 15 August 2006.\n\nMINUSTAH is also a precedent as the first mission in the region to be led by the Brazilian and Chilean military, and almost entirely composed of, Latin American forces, particularly from Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, Ecuador and Uruguay.\nFrom 1 September 2007 until his death following the earthquake on 12 January 2010, the mission was led by Tunisian Hédi Annabi.\n\nIndia provided three units of around 500 police personnel for MINUSTAH. The Indian contingent joined the mission in October 2008, and were stationed in Port-au-Prince and Hinche. They were tasked with maintaining law and order, setting up and operating checkpoints, and anti-crime operations. Two Indian police units will remain in Haiti after MINUSTAH ends on 15 October 2017, to serve in the successor mission, the United Nations Mission for Justice Support in Haiti (MINUJUSTH).\n\nOn 23 February 2004, the United Nations Security Council was convened at the request of CARICOM for the first time in four years to address the deteriorating situation in Haiti.\n\nOn 29 February 2004, the Security Council passed a resolution \"taking note of the resignation of Jean-Bertrand Aristide as President of Haiti and the swearing-in of President Boniface Alexandre as the acting President of Haiti in accordance with the Constitution of Haiti\" and authorized the immediate deployment of a Multinational Interim Force.\n\nOn 30 April 2004, MINUSTAH was established and given its mandate with a military component of up to 6,700 troops.\n\nIn July, the General Assembly authorized the financing of the mission with US$200 million which followed a donors' conference in Washington DC.\n\nThe first progress report from MINUSTAH was released at the end of August.\n\nIn September the interim president of Haiti, Boniface Alexandre, spoke to the United Nations General Assembly in support of MINUSTAH.\n\nIn November there was a second report, and the Security Council mandate for MINUSTAH.\n\nThe mandate has most recently been extended by the Security Council until October 2010 \"with the intention of further renewal\".\n\nAlthough the United Nations Stabilization Mission (MINUSTAH) has been in Haiti since 2004, as of 2007, it continued to struggle for control over the armed gangs. It maintains an armed checkpoint at the entrance to the shanty town of Cité Soleil and the road is blocked with armed vehicles. In January 2006, two Jordanian peacekeepers were killed in Cité Soleil. In October 2006 a heavily armed group of the Haitian National Police were able to enter Cité Soleil for the first time in three years and were able to remain one hour as armoured UN troops patrolled the area. Since this is where the armed gangs take their kidnap victims, the police's ability to penetrate the area even for such a short time was seen as a sign of progress. The situation of continuing violence is similar in Port-au-Prince. Ex-soldiers, supporters of the ex-president, occupied the home of ex-president Jean-Bertrand Aristide against the wishes of the Haitian government. Before Christmas 2006 the UN force announced that it would take a tougher stance against gang members in Port-au-Prince, but since then the atmosphere there has not improved and the armed roadblocks and barbed wire barricades have not been moved. After four people were killed and another six injured in a UN operation exchange of fire with criminals in Cité Soleil in late January 2007, the United States announced that it would contribute $20 million to create jobs in Cité Soleil.\n\nIn early February 2007, 700 UN troops flooded Cité Soleil, which led to a major gun battle. Although the troops make regular forcible entries into the area, a spokesperson said this one was the largest attempted so far by the UN troops.\nOn 28 July 2007, Edmond Mulet, the UN Special Representative in Haiti and MINUSTAH Mission Chief, warned of a sharp increase in lynchings and other mob attacks in Haiti. He said MINUSTAH, which now has 9,000 troops there, will launch a campaign to remind people lynchings are a crime.\n\nOn 2 August 2007, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon arrived in Haiti to assess the role of the UN forces, announcing that he would visit Cité Soleil during his visit. He said that it was Haiti's largest slum and as such was the most important target for U.N. peacekeepers in gaining control over the armed gangs. During his visit he announced an extension of the mandate of the UN forces in Haiti. It took MINUSTAH three months and 800 arrests to deal with the gangs and lessen the number of kidnappings on the streets.\n\nPresident René Préval has expressed ambivalent feelings about the UN security presence, stating \"if the Haitian people were asked if they wanted the UN forces to leave they would say yes.\" Survivors frequently blame the UN peacekeepers for deaths of relatives.\n\nIn April 2008, Haiti was facing a severe food crisis as well as governmental destabilization to Parliament's failure to ratify the president's choice of a prime minister. There were severe riots and the UN force fired rubber bullets in Port-au-Prince and the riot calmed. The head of MINUSTAH has called for a new government to be chosen as soon as possible. Meanwhile, the UN provided emergency food. Haiti was hit by four consecutive hurricanes between August and September 2008. These storms crippled coastal regions, requiring humanitarian aid for 800,000.\n\nCritics of MINUSTAH's goal of providing security say that the provision of increased police presence is coming with the unfortunate consequence of neglecting the vast socioeconomic problems in the area, the lack of effort in addressing infrastructure improvement, the joblessness and the pervasive poverty. In 2009, with the appointment of former U.S. President Bill Clinton as the UN Special Envoy, there is hope that the international donor community will provide increased aid. MINUSTAH renewed its commitment to Haiti, and $3 billion for projects has been pledged by the international community, much of this for rebuilding after the hurricanes. However, in Cité Soleil, there are signs of a desire for political independence that the international community would rather ignore.\n\nIn October 2010, nine months after the earthquake, the UN extended MINUSTAH's mission. In the capital there were protests from those who want the MINUSTAH to leave. Demonstrators chanted \"Down with the occupation\" and burned the flag of Brazil, as representative of the largest contingent of MINUSTAH.\n\nOn 12 January 2010, the United Nations reported that headquarters of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), the \"Christopher Hotel\" in Port-au-Prince, collapsed, and several other UN facilities were damaged; a large number of UN personnel were unaccounted for in the aftermath of a major earthquake. The Mission's Chief, Hédi Annabi, was reported dead on 13 January by President René Préval and French news sources and on 16 January the United Nations confirmed the death after his body was recovered by a search and rescue team from China. Principal Deputy Special Representative Luiz Carlos da Costa was also confirmed dead, as well as the Acting Police Commissioner, Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Superintendent Doug Coates, who were meeting with eight Chinese nationals—four peacekeepers and a delegation of four police officers from China—when the earthquake struck. The Chinese search and rescue team recovered the bodies of the ten individuals on 16 January 2010. Jens Kristensen, senior humanitarian officer for the UN was rescued by a team from the state of Virginia after five days trapped in the rubble.\n\n\n\nIn October 2010, a cholera outbreak was confirmed in Haiti—the first in the country's modern history. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as of 4 August 2013, over 800,000 cases and 9,600 deaths had been reported since the outbreak first began in October 2010. MINUSTAH was linked with introducing the disease to the country by sources such as the CDC, the American Society for Microbiology, Yale Law School and the School of Public Health. The cause of the disease was attributed to faulty construction of UN sanitation systems in its base located in the town of Méyè. Many reports from Méyè stated that people had seen sewage spilling from the UN base into the Artibonite River, the largest river in Haiti, and which is used by residents for drinking, cooking, and bathing.\n\nIn December 2010, a study traced the Haitian cholera strain to South Asia. The UN conducted an independent investigation into the origin of the epidemic at the end of 2010. A panel of independent UN experts was assembled and their collective findings were compiled in a report. The panel determined that the evidence implicating the Nepalese troops was inconclusive. Though they admitted that the cholera strain was most likely from Nepal, it cited a confluence of factors that also contributed to the outbreak and that no one \"deliberate action of, a group or individual was to blame\". However, in 2013, the committee changed its statement concluding that the UN troops from Nepal \"most likely\" were the cause of the outbreak.\n\nThe Bureau des Avocats Internationaux (BAI), a Haitian coalition of lawyers, and the Institute for Justice & Democracy in Haiti (IJDH), its U.S. affiliate, filed claims with MINUSTAH on behalf of 5,000 Haitian petitioners in November 2011. The claims asked for the installation of the water and sanitation infrastructure necessary to control the epidemic, compensation for the victims, and an apology. Fifteen months later, in February 2013, the UN stated that the case was \"not receivable,\" because it involved \"review of policy matters\", citing the Convention on Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations. In October 2013, BAI, IJDH, and another U.S. law firm filed a lawsuit challenging UN immunity in U.S. federal court on behalf of Haitian and Haitian-American victims of the cholera epidemic. In January 2015, Judge J. Paul Oetken of the U.S. District Court in Manhattan dismissed the lawsuit, affirming UN immunity. In May 2015, an appeal to Oetken's decision was filed.\n\nIn February 2013, the Haitian government created its National Plan for the Elimination of Cholera, a 10-year plan set to eradicate the disease. Two of the ten years will be devoted as a short-term response to the epidemic. The last eight will be to completely eliminate the disease. The projected budget for the plan is $2 billion. To support the initiative, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon pledged $23.5 million to combat cholera. However, following the pledge, there was much discontent with the UN's progress. 19 members of the U.S. Congress urged the UN to take responsibility for cholera in Haiti. In two separate occasions, members of the US Congress sent a letter to the US ambassador to the UN, Susan Rice, urging her and the organization to ensure that the cholera initiative was fully funded and implemented quickly. Nineteen US Representatives also wrote to Ban Ki-Moon to express concerns about the seeming lack of progress in the UN's cholera response. Ban Ki-moon told members of the US Congress that the UN was committed in helping Haiti overcome the epidemic though no financial compensation to the victims would be granted. Since 2010, the UN has spent and/or committed more than $140 million to the epidemic.\n\nOn 9 May 2013, the Haitian Senate unanimously voted—save for one abstention—on a policy that would demand the UN to compensate the nation's cholera victims. The Senators also proposed to form \"a commission of experts in international and penal law to study what legal means, both nationally and internationally, could be used to prove MINUSTAH's responsibility for starting the cholera outbreak.\"\n\nIn August 2016, a report written by UN special rapporteur Philip Alston was leaked to the \"New York Times\". Alston issued a scathing condemnation of the UN's legal approach to cholera in Haiti, which he termed \"morally unconscionable, legally indefensible and politically self-defeating.\" Alston also lamented that the UN's approach \"upholds a double standard according to which the U.N. insists that member states respect human rights, while rejecting any such responsibility for itself.\"\n\nLater that year, in December 2016, then Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon issued an apology for the UN's \"role\" in the cholera outbreak and stressed the organization's \"moral responsibility\" to fight the disease. Though the apology stopped short of admitting the UN was at fault for introducing the disease to Haiti, it was seen as a major milestone by many advocates for Haitian cholera victims. Secretary-General Ban also launched \"a new approach\" to cholera by the UN, in the form of a two-track plan. The UN would raise $400 million in voluntary contributions from member states, with $200 million dedicated to providing material assistance to communities most affected by cholera, and another $200 million going to fight the disease.\n\nUnfortunately the plan has gained little traction among member states. The UN did not require that the remainder of the funds allocated to the MINUSTAH be repurposed for cholera reparations, which resulted in many member nations taking back their contributions. As of July 2017, the UN had raised just $9.22 million of the promised $400 million total. Advocates have voiced their displeasure with these results, and the public outcry has grown more forceful as of late; the UN has announced the MINUSTAH mission will be ending in October 2017, and many are calling for the new approach to be funded by the time of the mission's departure.\n\nFrom the beginning, MINUSTAH has been squeezed between traditional conservative sectors—which demanded more action—and the leftist parties, mainly linked to ousted President Aristide, which criticize its actions and constantly appeal for its departure.\n\nEven though mostly composed by military forces—the recruitment of large numbers of foreign police officers has proven difficult—the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti is a police mission of the United Nations dispatched to a country facing uncontained violence stemming from political unrest and from common criminals. Partidaries of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide have characterized MINUSTAH as an attempt by the United States, Canada and France to neutralize the supporters of Fanmi Lavalas, Aristide's party. and secure the more pro-Western government of Gérard Latortue. The mission was mandated to assist and reinforce the action of the Haitian Police in Port-au-Prince's slums.\n\nOn 6 July 2005, MINUSTAH, led by Brazilian general Augusto Heleno carried out a raid in the Cité Soleil section of Port-au-Prince. The raid targeted a base of illegally armed rebels led by the known bandit Dread Wilme. Reports from pro-Lavalas sources, as well as journalist Kevin Pina, contend that the raid targeted civilians and was an attempt to destroy the popular support for Haiti's exiled former leader, Aristide, before scheduled upcoming elections.\n\nEstimates on the number of fatalities range from five to as high as 80, with the higher numbers being claimed by those reporting that the raid targeted civilians. All sources agree that no MINUSTAH personnel were killed. All sources also agree that Dread Wilme (born \"Emmanuel Wilmer\") was killed in the raid. MINUSTAH spokespeople called Wilme a \"gangster.\" Other sources, such as the pro-Aristide Haitian Lawyers Leadership Network call Wilme a community leader and a martyr.\n\nThe incident has been since heralded by groups who oppose the MINUSTAH presence in Haiti and who support the return of ousted President Aristide. MINUSTAH has also been accused by Fanmi Lavalas supporters of allowing the Haitian National Police to commit atrocities and massacres against Lavalas supporters and Haitian citizens.\n\nOn 6 January 2006, UN mission head Juan Gabriel Valdés announced that MINUSTAH forces would undertake another action on Cité Soleil. On one side, traditional Haitian sectors criticized MINUSTAH for \"standing by and not stopping the violence taking place in slums like Cité Soelil\"; on the other hand, human rights groups were prepared to blame MINUSTAH for any collateral damage deriving from their actions. It was reported that Valdés said, \"We are going to intervene in the coming days. I think there'll be collateral damage but we have to impose our force, there is no other way.\"\n\nMINUSTAH soldiers have been accused of being involved in a number of sexual assault cases. In 2011, four Uruguayan UN marines were accused of gang raping a 19-year-old Haitian male in Port-Salut. It was said the alleged rape was recorded with a cell phone by the peacekeepers themselves and leaked to the Internet. The teenager and his family were forced to relocate their house after the video went viral. In March 2012, three Pakistani MINUSTAH officers were found guilty of raping a mentally challenged 14-year-old boy in the town of Gonaïves. Pakistani officials sentenced each officer to one year in a Pakistan prison.\n\nIn November 2007, 114 members of the 950-member Sri Lanka peacekeeping contingent in Haiti were accused of sexual misconduct and abuse. 108 members, including 3 officers were sent back after being implicated in alleged misconduct and sexual abuse. UN spokeswoman Michele Montas said: \"The United Nations and the Sri Lankan government deeply regret any sexual exploitation and abuse that has occurred.\" The Sri Lankan Officials claim that there is little tangible evidence on this case. After inquiry into the case the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) has concluded 'acts of sexual exploitation and abuse (against children) were frequent and occurred usually at night, and at virtually every location where the contingent personnel were deployed.' The OIOS is assisting in the pending legal proceedings initiated by the Sri Lankan Government and has said charges should include statutory rape \"because it involves children under 18 years of age\".\nIn 2015, a new investigation was released, accusing MINUSTAH peacekeepers of abusing further hundreds of Haitians.\n\nIn 2010, Gérard Jean-Gilles, a 16-year-old Haitian boy who ran miscellaneous errands for the Nepalese soldiers in Cap-Haitien, was found dead hanging inside of MINUSTAH's Formed Police Unit base. UN personnel denied responsibility, claiming that the teen committed suicide. The troops released the body for autopsy seventy-two hours after the death; the examination ruled out suicide as a potential cause of death. Nepalese UN troops were also accused for other misdeeds. Several days before the Jean-Gilles incident, the local press charged a Nepalese soldier of torturing a minor in a public area in Cap-Haitien. The soldier was said to have forced \"his hands into the youth's mouth in an attempt to separate his lower jaw from his upper jaw, tearing the skin of his mouth.\"\n\nPeople related to Fanmi Lavalas (Haiti's largest leftist party) have repeatedly expressed discontent with MINUSTAH and its management of political public dissent. Protests on 15 November 2010 in Cap-Haitien and other areas of the country resulted in at least two civilian deaths and numerous injuries.

{"id": "2163246", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2163246", "title": "Muslim ibn Aqil", "text": "Muslim ibn Aqil\n\nMuslim ibn Aaqil al-Hashimi ( \"\") was the son of ibn Abi Talib and a member of the clan of Bani Hashim, thus, he is a cousin of Hussain ibn Ali. The people of Kufa called upon Husayn to overthrow the Umayyad dynasty who was on his way to Mecca for the Hajj pilgrimage. He wanted to confirm the loyalty of the people of Kufa, so he sent his cousin and his ambassador, Muslim ibn Aaqill, a famous warrior, to Kufa to observe the situation. He sent a letter to Hussain confirming their loyalty, before knowing that the 30,000 followers that he gained would all betray him for their lives. He was executed by the newly installed governor, Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad, on the 9th of Zilhaj, 60 AH, and is buried at the back of Great Mosque of Kufa.\n\nHussain ibn Ali received thousands of letters from people of Kufa stating that they were rejecting their governor and asking him to come and serve as their Imam. One letter in particular contained these words: \"\"We invite you to come to Kufa as we have no Imam to guide us. Through you Allah will unite us on the path of truth\".\" A few days later, the people of Kufa sent an emissary, a special messenger, to Husayn ibn Ali to persuade him to go to Kufa. There followed hundreds of other letters and many special emissaries from the people of Kufa to Hussain ibn Ali.\n\nReceiving so many petitions and messages from Kufa, Husayn ibn Ali decided to send Muslim ibn Aqeel, who was a famous warrior, as his emissary to Kufa to study the situation there and report to Hussain ibn Ali.\n\nHe wrote a letter to the people of Kufa and gave it to Muslim ibn Aqeel. In this letter Husayn ibn Ali said, \"\"I am sending my cousin and one of the most trusted ones from my family, Muslim ibn Aqeel, to report to me about your affairs. If his report agrees with what you have written I will soon be with you. You must be clear of the fact that the Imam is the only one who follows the book of Allah, and serves Allah in all matters and affairs with justice, honesty and truth\".\"\n\nHusayn ibn Ali also told Ibn Aqeel: \"\"Muslim, the whole world knows that you are one of the bravest warriors. It is just possible that seeing you in Kufa some people may think that our intention is to fight Yazid. Take your two sons Muhammad and Ibrahim with you. When they see you with such young children, they will know that our intentions are peaceful\".\"\n\nAccording to reports, Muslim ibn Aqeel's sons were so young, that they could not even tie up the buttons of their shirts.\n\nHusayn sent three people with Muslim: Qays Ibn Mash'ar, 'Imarah Ibn 'Abdullah al-Saluli, and 'Abdul Rahman Ibn 'Abdullah al-Azd, in addition to the messenger from Kufa.\n\nThis group set off from Mecca on the 15th of Ramadan. His first destination was Medina, where he left his family and hired two people to guide him on his way. The guides, however, lost their way in the desert and were too weak from lack of water to continue on. But in their weakened physical state, they managed to show Muslim the right direction before they both died of thirst.\n\nMuslim arrived in Kufa on 5 Shawwal 60 AH/ 9 July 680. He went first to the house of al-Mukhtar ibn Abu 'Ubayd al-Thaqafi, who was highly liked by his people and who later became the person who ordered the murder of Ibn Ziyad.\n\nMore than 18,000-30,000 people appeared before Muslim ibn Aqeel and enthusiastically pledged their allegiance to Husayn ibn Ali as their Imam and pledged to support Husayn even with their lives. Muslim ibn Aqeel, encouraged by this response, reported to Husayn ibn Ali by letter that he should proceed to Kufa.\n\nThe governor of Kufa, al-Nu'man Ibn Bashir, was told of Muslim's arrival, but refused to attack him. Bashir was a mild man and did not want to harm the members of the family of the Prophet, so he did nothing to stop Muslim. Many of the supporters of Yazid saw this lack of action as a sign of weakness and encouraged the caliph to replace Bashir with a stronger man. Yazid then deposed Bashir and replaced him with Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad. Ibn Ziyad was a resourceful and often cruel politician who spared nothing in order to attain political ends. His strong and ruthless character was exactly what the caliph was looking for in order to gain control in Kufa. Yazid wrote to him, \"\"Go to Kufa, capture Muslim ibn 'Aqil and see what is appropriate to imprison him, send him to exile or kill him.\"\"\n\nThe morning of his arrival in Kufa, Ibn Ziyad gathered the people at the grand mosque. There he delivered a speech warning them against mutiny and promised them generous rewards for conforming. He said, \"\"Anyone found to be sheltering one of those who scheme against the authority of the commander of the faithful and who does not hand him over will be crucified on the door of his own house\".\"\n\nDuring this time, Ibn Ziyad was working diligently to discover the hiding place of Muslim. He knew that the people of Kufa were meeting secretly, but he was not able to figure out the location. Ibn Ziyad decided that the best way to find Muslim would be to infiltrate his inner circle. He called upon his servant, Ma'qil, to meet him. He gave Ma'qil three thousand dirhams and ordered him to meet with the Shi'as. He was to tell them that he was a Syrian slave who has just arrived in the country and wanted to hand deliver a donation to Muslim. Ma'qil entered the grand mosque and was introduced to Muslim. Ma'qil then delivered the money and swore allegiance to him. This servant continued to meet with Muslim in the coming days. No secrets were kept from him, so he kept gathering information, which he then reported back to Ibn Ziyad in the evenings.\n\nWith the information from Ma'qil, Ibn Ziyad was able to figure out that Muslim was staying at the house of Hani. The governor gathered some of the friends of Hani and asked why he had not visited in quite a while. They made excuses for him, saying that he had been sick and other similar things. Hani was then summoned by the governor who accused him of harboring Muslim in his house. Hani denied this claim and things got heated. Ibn Ziyad then called in Ma'qil and had him corroborate the story that Ibn Ziyad was trying to paint. At this point, Hani was arrested, beaten in the face with an iron-tipped cane, and thrown into prison and was later executed with Muslim ibn Aqeel.\n\nMuslim reported to Husayn through Abis ibn Shabib that most of the people in Kufa were ready to receive him as their Imam and advised that Husayn should proceed to Kufa (Tareekh-e-Tabri, Vol.6, Page211). Amongst the people of Kufa there were many spies employed by Yazid to report to him directly. When Yazid heard from them of the invitations to Hussain and the arrival in Kufa of Muslim he was filled with fury. He sent a message to his Governor in Basrah, Ubaydullah ibn Ziyad, to go to Kufa and take over the position of Nu'amaan ibne Basheer. Ibn Ziyad was also told to arrest Muslim and murder him and do all that was necessary to suppress the Shiahs in Kufa.\n\nIbn Ziyad was a shrewd man. He kept his journey from Basra to Kufa a secret and just before entering Kufa he covered his face with a black scarf so that he could not be recognized. He had a few horsemen in front of him and a few behind him as he entered Kufa. The people of Kufa had been waiting for the arrival of Imam Hussain anxiously and they presumed that the Imam had arrived. Soon people started gathering around him and singing welcoming songs. Ibn Ziyad kept observing the people and memorizing faces as the crowd grew and soon it was difficult for his convoy to proceed swiftly. One of his guards, Muslim bin Amr Bahili, shouted \"Clear the way, this is the Amir Ubaidullah ibn Ziyad\". Hearing this, people started running away quickly and when Ibn Ziyad reached the Dar-al-Amara only a handful people had been left. Ibn Ziyad arrived in Kufa on the evening of 2nd Dhul-Hajj. On the following day he went to the mosque and addressed the people of Kufa. He first announced his appointment as Yazid's governor. He then threatened any one who was engaged in any activity against the government with immediate death, and ordered them to surrender Muslim to him.\n\nIbn Ziyad sealed Kufa in such a way that no one could go in or out of the city without the governor's permission.\n\nSince several people knew that he was staying with Mukhtar Thaqafi, Muslim decided to move from there as a measure of precaution and protection. At the invitation of Hani ibn Urwah, another leading member of the Shia community, he moved to Hani's house. This was done secretly and except for a few people no one knew where Muslim was. Through a spy, Maaqal, who pretended to be a Shia, Ibn Ziyad found out where Muslim was. Since ibn Ziyad had prior relations with Hani, he called him by trick to his palace and got him arrested and thrown into prison. Muslim got the news of Hani's arrest and not wishing to further endanger the lives of his friends, Muslim and his two sons left Hani's house. He left the children with Shurayb, a judge, and went into the desert to try to get back to Husayn to warn him not to go to Kufa. This was the 7th of Dhul-Hajj. That whole day and the following day Muslim tried to get out of the city. He found all the exits sealed and guarded by Ibn Ziyad's soldiers.\n\nOn the 7th, late in the evening, tired, hungry and exhausted, Muslim knocked on the door of a house on the outskirts of the city. A lady named 'Tuwaa\" opened the door. Muslim requested for a little water to quench his thirst. The lady gave him water. When she learnt who he was, she invited him in and offered him shelter for the night. She gave Muslim food and water and took him to a room where he spent the night.\n\nLate that night Tuwaa's son came home. When he learned that the man Ibn Ziyad was looking for was in his mother's house, he felt that he would be rewarded by the governor if he got Muslim arrested. Unknown to his mother he slipped out in the darkness of the night and gave the information to a captain in Ibn Ziyad's army. Early the next morning, five hundred soldiers under the leadership of Mohammad bin Ashas surrounded the house of Tuwaa and demanded Muslim's surrender. Muslim came out holding his sword. Three times he drove the enemy away and killed 150 men. Twice Ibn Ziyad had to send in reinforcements.\n\nWhile Muslim was fighting, some soldiers went up the rooftops and began throwing stones and lighted torches at him. Others dug a trench in the path of Muslim and covered it with grass. Ibn Ziyad told his commanders to trick Muslim otherwise it would not be possible to capture him. Although badly wounded and totally exhausted, Muslim kept on fighting. As a trick, soldiers of Ibn Ziyad offered peace and protection to Muslim but he rejected the offer. He was deeply wounded in this tough fight and finally fell into the trench. He was pounced upon, chained and dragged to the court of Ibn Ziyad.\n\nHistorians narrate that Muslim was badly wounded when he entered the court of Ibn Ziyad. His teeth were broken and blood was flowing from all over. Still he entered the court like a 'Lion'. Someone in the court told him to pay respect to Ibn Ziyad because he is the \"Amir\" (Ruler). Muslim refused and replied that his Amir was only Husayn.\n\nIbn Ziyad told Muslim that he would be killed and asked him if he had any last wishes. Muslim replied saying, \"I owe a debt which should be discharged by selling off my sword and armour. Secondly I want my body to be given a proper burial. Thirdly I want a message sent to Hussain advising him not to come to Kufa.\" Ibn Ziyad agreed to the first request but refused to do anything about the second and third requests. He then ordered Muslim to be taken to the roof of the palace to be executed and his body thrown to the ground.\n\nMuslim was calm and composed as he was dragged up the steps. He was reciting \"Allahu Akber\" until the last moment. Then there was an absolute silence followed by a thud as the head of Muslim was chopped and his body fell to the ground. This was on the 9th of Dhul-Hujja. Immediately after Muslim was killed, Hani ibn Urwah as well was dragged to the roof top and executed.\n\nIbn Ziyad ordered Muqair Ibn Obran-e-Ahmari to take him to the palace's roof. They went to the top of the fortress, Muslim was decapitated in front of the people, his head was thrown down first and then followed by his body. Hani was also executed. They were executed in this way in order to intimidate the populace. Ibn Ziyad ordered that the bodies of these two men be dragged by their feet through the streets and marketplaces in Kufa. Muslim's body was then crucified upside down and the heads of Muslim and Hani were sent to Yazid to be displayed on the streets of Damascus.\n\nMuslim bin Aqeel's two sons, Mohammad and Ibrahim, were also killed in Kufa.\n\nMuslim called on the people of Kufa for assistance and narrations say that approximately 40,000 people accompanied him to the government building. By then, Ibn Ziyad had placed the leaders of Kufa on the roof top of the building and threatened to kill them if they did not leave Muslim bin Aqeel.\n\nWithin a short while, not one person from the 40,000 was with Muslim.\n\nMuslim was later taken by the soldiers of Ibn Ziyaad and was martyred. Later, the two sons of Muslim were also martyred. These were two young children who accompanied their father, thinking that they were journeying to a place that was filled with true followers of the Ahle Bait.\n\nOn receiving the letter of Muslim, Hussain departed from Makkah and left for Kufa. When this group of the Ahlul Bayt left Makkah, every person and every child stood watching them with sadness as they left.\n\nTheir eyes filled with tears and their hearts heavy with sadness. On his way, he received news of the death of Muslim and his children. Hussain was also informed of the betrayal of the people of Kufa. He was very sad when he heard this news and read In'na lil'laahi Wa in'na ilaihi Raaji'oon. He then comforted the family members and gave them hope.\n\nWhen the Ahlul Bayt reached a place called Thaa'lba, Hussain rested for a while. He awoke with tears in his eyes. His beloved sister, Zainab asked the reason for this, and he said, \"I dreamt of our grandfather, Rasulullah Sallallahu Alaihi Wa’aleh Wasallam. The Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wa’aleh Wasallam was crying and he said \"O Hussain! You are soon to come and meet with me.\"\n\nOn hearing this, Ali Akbar the son of Hussain said, \" O my dear father! Are we not on Haq (truth)?\" Hussain replied, \"verily we are on Haq and Haq is with us.\" Then Ali Akbar said, \"why then should we fear death, O my father? We all must pass from this world one day. I am seeing the gardens of Shahaadat and a mansion better than that of the world and bounties even greater than that of this world are before us.\"\n\nWhile Muslim was not killed at Karbala, he is counted as one of the martyrs of the battle.\n\nThe Shi'ite recommend visiting his grave in Kufa and there are certain prayers that are to be recited there.\n\nOn the other hand, there is the mausoleum of Ruqayyah bint Ali (Wife of Muslim ibn Aqeel) located in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. Legend has it that it holds the graves of six ladies (one is Ruqqayah herself and others are Muslim's sisters) from Muhammad's household (Ahl Al-Bayt).\n\nToday, Muslim ibn Aqeel's descendants go by the surname \"Uqaili\" and are found in Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq.\n\n\n"}

It was both developed and published by Konami. The game is a 3D aerial combat simulation, featuring many jet fighter aircraft. The game is single player only and has been compared to \"Ace Combat\" by GameSpy and GameSpot. At the time of the game's release, \"Airforce Delta\" was the only combat flight simulation game available for the Dreamcast.\n\nA Game Boy Color version of \"Airforce Delta\" was also released in 2000.\n\nA sequel, called \"Airforce Delta Storm\" in North America (\"Airforce Delta II\" in Japan and \"Deadly Skies\" in Europe), was also released for the Xbox platform in 2001 and for Game Boy Advance in 2002. The Game Boy Advance version, while having the same name as the sequel, has a plot based mostly on the previous game in the series, \"Airforce Delta\".\n\nA second sequel, called \"Airforce Delta Strike\" in North America (\"Airforce Delta: Blue Wing Knights\" in Japan and \"Deadly Skies III\" in Europe), was released for the PlayStation 2 in 2004.\n\nA third sequel, called \"Airforce Delta Alternative\", was released for Mobile Phones in 2007 in Japan only.\n\nPlayers take control of a mercenary that has been contracted to complete a number of strategic military missions. Each mission completed earns the player money, and the more money that is accumulated, the more sophisticated aircraft the player can purchase. Players select from a myriad of fighters and take to the skies to defend a newly independent Republic of Laconia from its many enemies—for fame, for glory, and most of all: for a price.\n\nThe first mission involves a preemptive strike against numerous fighter planes that are planning to bomb the Laconian capital city of Naxos.\n\nThe game centers around the Federated Republic of Dzavailar. Ethnic tension and religious debate have caused the Republic to split into independent states. The defenseless Republic of Laconia is in dire need of military support. Rebels from the former Federated Republic of Dzavailar have decided to reunite a territory long divided by ethnic conflict. After years of civil war, Laconia is the only republic left standing and has asked a mercenary defense organization to help keep it from falling to the dreaded unification movement.\n\nAs a commissioned lieutenant assigned to the Delta Squadron, you are about to embark on a series of over 20 missions in very hostile territories. You have been brought on board because you are the best in the business: a crack pilot who can take out multiple bogeys without batting an eyelash. It is your aerial experience that Laconia is banking on, since you will be alone throughout the campaign.\n\nAirforce Delta takes place on the fictitious continent of Dzavailar. A radical government called the \"People's Federation of Dzavailar\" is intent on conquering all of former Federated Republic of Dzavailar territories, and they already have most of its newly independent provinces under siege. The last remaining free republic has called upon Airforce Delta, an elite group of mercenary fighter jet pilots, to defeat the People's Federation and liberate the continent. You are the newest recruit in AFD, and you are given a series of 20 missions to carry out. Before each mission, you are given a briefing which gives details on destroying a certain number of targets.\n\n\"Airforce Delta\" features simplistic controls with an emphasis on arcade-style action rather than accurate flight simulation.\n\nThe mission briefings are complete with an illustrated step-by-step guide which shows you your designated targets and the ideal path to take. After completing a mission, players are awarded with money that can later be used to purchase superior aircraft. Variables such as mission completion time and the number of enemies you have disposed of dictate the amount of money you will receive. When making a buying decision, choosing an aircraft most appropriate for the job is of the utmost importance. The most expensive does not necessarily mean the most practical.\n\nMissions typically involve either seeking out and destroying the enemy or escorting friendly craft to a certain destination. The enemies encountered in \"Airforce Delta\" are diverse and range from air to ground and water capabilities and from offensive to defensive situations. Mission maps are based on fictional locations.\n\n\"Airforce Delta\" features over thirty aircraft to take for a test flight. They are all based on real life aircraft both in looks and in handling. Some of the planes available for these missions include the F-4 Phantom, F-14 Tomcat, A-10 Thunderbolt, Mig 29, Su-27 and the F-22 Raptor.\n\nThe Dreamcast version of the game was met with mixed to positive reviews, while the Game Boy Color received a mixed to negative reception; GameRankings gave it a score of 65.91% for the Dreamcast version, and 42.50% for the Game Boy Color version. In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave the Dreamcast version a score of 31 out of 40.\n\n"}

Becket died in 2017. The hotel is still operating next to the opera house, but beyond these maintained areas, the town is in a state of disrepair. There is no gas station, and only one restaurant, the Amargosa Cafe. The town is owned by the non-profit Amargosa Opera House Inc. which runs the Opera House, Hotel, and cafe\n\nThe community's location, east-southeast of Furnace Creek, on the east side of Death Valley is south of Nevada's Amargosa Valley and near Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge. East/South East, 27 miles, is Pahrump, Nevada. South on SR127 is the town of Shoshone, California. The closest straight-line distance to the Nevada state line is roughly five miles northeast.\n\nGovernment documents show an effort by the Timbisha Shoshone tribal government to acquire about in the area during 1999 to 2000. This includes areas for residences and the official federal sanction to use some government lands for traditional ceremonies. In 2017 the tribe constructed a cannabis grow facility on the land.\n\nThe town was created in 1907 when the Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad was constructed through the Amargosa Valley and a spur from their main line was built to the Lila C. borax mine in the hills to the west. The town was originally owned by Robert Tubb, who operated a saloon, store, and brothel. The town first appears on the 1910 Furnace Creek Quandrangle USGS topographic map.\n\nIn 1914, the Death Valley Railroad started operating between Ryan, California and Death Valley Junction. It carried borax until 1928, when operations ceased. From 1923 to 1925 the Pacific Coast Borax Company constructed buildings in the town, hiring architect Alexander Hamilton McCulloch to design a Spanish Colonial Revival whistle stop centered at the hotel, theater and office complex building, now known as the Amargosa Opera House and Hotel.\n\nThe town began to decline in the mid-20th century. However, in 1967 dancer and actress Marta Becket happened to visit due to an automobile repair. She became enamored with the theater, and with help from benefactors, she leased, then purchased, the hotel and theater complex.\n\nThe Death Valley post office opened in 1908 and transferred to Furnace Creek Ranch in 1961. The Amargosa post office opened in 1962, changed its name to Death Valley Junction in 1968.\n\nIn 1980 the town was included in the National Register of Historic Places as the \"Death Valley Junction Historic District.\"\n\nWhen the Death Valley Railroad was established in 1914, it used of tracks belonging to the Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad east-southeast of Death Valley Junction to Horton.\n\nLocal wired telephones were manual telephone service until the 1980s.

It has Inter-State Bus Terminus. It is adjacent to the Hazrat Nizamuddin Railway Station. It is one of the five main stations in Delhi and is the originating and terminal station for 60 trains. Sarai Kale Khan is the terminus for most buses heading for towns south of Delhi. It is also a DTC bus depot for the Mudrika Seva (Ring Road Bus Service) and many other bus routes.\n\nThe area was named 'Kale khan ki sarai', a \"sarai\", or rest house for travellers or caravans and royal route from Mughal imperial courts and Chandni Chowk to their retreat at Mehrauli some 32 km away. The sarai itself named after a Sufi saint, Kale Khan of 14th–15th century, whose resting place along with that of another Sufi saint of Delhi, resting place of Hazrat Roshan Khan is today situated inside the Delhi Airport complex. Though a Lodi era structure \"Kale Khan ka Gumad\" is also situated at Kotla Mubarakpur Complex in South Delhi, the tomb is dated to 1481 AD as per an inscription on the Mihrab inside the tomb, this Kale Khan was a courtier in the Lodi period during the reign of Bahlol Lodi \n\nNawab Faizullah Beg, son of Nawab Qasim Jan, a courtier in reign of Mughal Emperor, Shah Alam II (r. 1728–1806), was a courtier in Bahadur Shah Zafar's reign, and built a complex later known as Ahata Kaley Sahab, so named a saint named Kaley Khan, who lived here for a while, after whom area was later named. The complex was later acquired by Bunyadi Begum, poet Mirza Ghalib's sister-in-law, and housed the poet after he was released from debtors' prison.\n\nThe name \"Sarai\" derives from the time of the rule of the Afghan Sher Shah Suri, under whom a paved road network was built, with roadside inns called \"Serais\" every twelve miles.\n\nSarai Kale Khan Inter-State Bus Terminus is a major bus terminus complex in Delhi, India catering to bus services to Haryana and Rajasthan states.\n\n\n"}

The coast has the typical Mediterranean hot, dry weather and warm sea. Until the early 1980s this was a quiet rural district but today the town of Kemer and coastal villages in the district play a very important part in tourism in Turkey.\n\nKemer was the ancient Greek city of Idyros, member of the Lycian League, which after the Ottoman era was called Eski Köy (\"Old Village\") until a long stone wall was built in 1916 - 1917 to channel the mountain stream water and protect the town from flooding, which until then had been a persistent problem. The name \"Kemer\" refers to those walls.\n\nBefore the population exchange between Greece and Turkey ,Greek families lived in the area with the Turks of the area peacefully coexisting.there is even a water mill that still exists in the village of Aslanbucak that used to belong to the Greeks of the village of Kemer and Aslanbucak,But the water mill is currently located in private property.\n\nUntil the 1960s there was no road connection and the district was accessible only by boat. Then a road was built and from the 1980s onwards this was followed by a great investment in infrastructure, planned by the state and funded by the World Bank, aimed at developing a large tourist industry.\n\nThe district has a population of 36,010 according to the 2010 census. The town itself has 20,785 inhabitants. Kemer has 4 municipalities (Beldibi, Çamyuva, Göynük, Tekirova) and 4 villages.\n\nThe population of the towns and villages (municipality names are embolded) are shown in the table below:\n\nOne of the major attractions of Kemer is its natural environment; including the sea, mountains and pine forests. The shore from Beldibi to Tekirova consists of a number of beaches in bays of various sizes, mostly stoney rather than sand. Supported by transport and communication links, and related municipal services, Kemer has a large proportion of the hotel bed capacity of the Antalya region, and attracts visitors from countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, and in recent years families from Russia. Many of the visitors come as part of low-cost all-inclusive package deals but tourism is still the mainstay of the local economy. There are so many visitors that most shops in Kemer are set up to sell things like leather jackets to overseas visitors and trade in the euro as well as the Turkish lira.\n\nKemer's 320 berth marina offers several restaurants for the tourists as well as being a wintering-over marina for liveaboard sailors from the USA, England and parts of Europe.\n\nGöynük (Goynuk) Canyon, Ulupınar, Olympos, Chimaera, Phaselis, Three Islands and Eco Park are the touristic sites of the Kemer area.\n\nThe town of Kemer has a number of clubs, bars and restaurants, blue flag beaches and a 320 capacity yacht marina. Coastal villages include Beldibi, Kiriş, Çayova, Aslanbucak, Kuzdere, Beycik, Çamyuva, Göynük, and Çıralı.\n\nAnnual events in the area include art exhibitions in Phaselis, boat races, WRC (World Rally Championship), Turkey Offshore Championship, Turkey Motocross Championship, Phaselis Art Festival, and Kemer Carnival. International pop stars and Djs, such as Tarkan and DJ Tiesto, give summer concerts on this coast.\n\nThe Presidential Cycling Tour of Turkey () is a professional road bicycle racing stage race held each spring.\n\nIn the last years there is rising number of outdoor enthusiasts visiting Kemer for trekking the Lycian Way and for mountainbiking.\n\nKemer has a hot Mediterranean climate with very hot, long and dry summers with cool, rainy winters. In the height of summer temperatures frequently exceed .\n\n\n\nKemer hosted the 2007 World Youth Chess Championship\nKemer is twinned with\n\n"}

It details the experiences that Corbett had in the Kumaon region of India from the 1900s to the 1930s, while hunting man-eating Bengal tigers and Indian leopards. One tiger, for example, was responsible for over 400 human deaths. \"Man-Eaters of Kumaon\" is the best known of Corbett's books and contains 10 stories of tracking and shooting man-eaters in the Indian Himalayas during the early years of the twentieth century. The text also contains incidental information on flora, fauna and village life. Seven of the stories were first published privately as Jungle Stories.\n\n\nAfter much prompting by friends and family in 1935 Corbett finally put to paper seven accounts of his jungle encounters. These were then made into a small book and 100 copies were privately published under the title \"Jungle Stories\" and distributed amongst friends. The stories were titled, \"Wild Life in the Village: An Appeal,\" \"The Pipal Pani Tiger,\" \"The Fish of My Dreams,\" \"A Lost Paradise,\" \"The Terror that Walks by Night,\" \"Purnagiri and Its Mysterious Lights,\" and \"The Chowgarh Tigers.\"\n\nIn 1943, whilst Corbett was wheelchair bound recovering from typhus fever, his close friend (R.E. Hawkins) and manager of India's branch of Oxford Press convinced him to write a book for publishing. Using the 1935 \"Jungle Stories\" as a basis, Corbett wrote \"Man-Eaters of Kumaon\" (10 stories) which was first published by Oxford University Press in 1944.\n\n\nBy May 1946 over half a million copies of \"Man-Eaters of Kumaon\" were in print. The book had been translated into four Western languages (including Spanish, Czech and Finnish) as well as six Indian languages. By 1980 the book went on to sell over four million copies worldwide.\n\nIn Chhindwara, India 1949 Jim Corbett's \"Man-Eaters of Kumaon\" was read out in court by defense for a murder charge. A villager by the name of Todal was found dead in the forest on 19 September 1949. The police's theory was that the accused conspired to murder the victim as he was in love with his wife, the defense was that the victim was killed by a man-eating tiger. Thus the defense produced Corbett's book and read passages relating relevant wounds and circumstances of an attack. The accused was later found not guilty.\n\nIn 1946 Universal Pictures brought the rights to the book and made the film \"Man-Eater of Kumaon\" (1948). The movie bore no relation to the book and centred on an American played by Wendell Corey who wounds a tiger and is later killed by it. Corbett saw the movie and claimed that the best actor was the tiger. In 1986, the BBC produced a docudrama titled \"Man-Eaters of India\" with Frederick Treves in the role of Jim Corbett. An IMAX movie, \"\", based on Corbett's books, was made in 2002. Corbett was played by Christopher Heyerdahl.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2163306", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2163306", "title": "The Green Eye of the Yellow God", "text": "The Green Eye of the Yellow God\n\nThe Green Eye of the Yellow God, a 1911 poem by J. Milton Hayes, is a famous example of the genre of \"dramatic monologue\", a music hall staple in the early twentieth century. The piece was written for and performed by actor and monologist Bransby Williams. It has often been misattributed to Rudyard Kipling, who classed its author as being among his many imitators, and often parodied, most famously by Billy Bennett as \"The Green Tie on the Little Yellow Dog\".\n\nThe opening lines are still very well known:\n\nIt is set in Nepal (\"to the north of\" Kathmandu), and tells the tale of a wild young officer known as \"Mad Carew\", who steals the \"green eye\" of a \"yellow god\" (presumably an emerald in a gold statue) in order to impress his beloved. He is wounded in the course of the robbery, and later murdered, presumably by a devotee of the god for the theft, who returns the jewel to the idol.\n\nIn his book \"My Brother Evelyn and Other Profiles\", Alec Waugh gives Hayes's account of the writing of the poem:\n\nHayes was inaccurate in the conflation of Nepal with India. While Britain achieved colonial control of India between 1858 and 1947, it never did so over Nepal. The political and military agreements between the two countries were therefore quite different. Any British officer in Nepal on official business at the time might have belonged to one of the Gurkha regiments, which recruited from Nepal. However, beyond the statement that \"he was worshipped in the ranks\" we are told little about Mad Carew's military background. He may have simply been on cross-border leave from India. \n\nIn December 2011, the BBC radio programme \"From Our Own Correspondent\" broadcast a piece by journalist Joanna Jolly in which she detailed a trip she made to Sankhu, a village to the north-east of Kathmandu. On a hill near the village is the Bajrayogini Temple in which there is a gold-plated statue of the Tantric goddess Bajrayogini, who is worshipped by Hindus and Buddhists. In the Newar community the goddess is called Mhasu Khwa Maju (Yellow Faced Mother Goddess). The statue has silver eyes which are only put in during festivals. Although there is no evidence that Hayes ever visited the area, the temple is mentioned in written sources dating back at least 200 years, so it is entirely plausible that he could have heard stories of this statue and the unusual practices regarding its eyes from returning colonial military personnel and wove these elements into his dramatic monologue.\n\nCharles Laughton and Vivien Leigh recite this poem in the film \"Sidewalks of London\", also known as \"St. Martins Lane\" (1938).\n\nA Music Hall sketch named \"Me'em Sahib\" features a performer trying to recite this, and keeps getting heckled by two British colonial officers sitting in a box seat, who have just returned and \"update\" him on the circumstances.\n\nIn an episode of \"Upstairs, Downstairs\", Mr. Hudson recites the opening lines at a seaside holiday outing by the staff of 165 Eaton Place on the last day of peace before World War I began.\n\nIn the episode \"The Fear of Wages\" of the long-running radio comedy \"The Goon Show\", characters trying to come up with excuses frequently answer along the lines of; \"Well, it's a long story. You see...\", and then quoting the opening lines (or variations) of the poem dramatically. In \"The Shifting Sands\", Bloodnok distorts it again, with \"There's a little green-eyed idol to the north of Kathmandu... but the wind blew up the chimney just the same\".\n\nJohn Lennon uses the opening line in the posthumously released song \"Nobody Told Me\" (changing \"one-eyed\" to \"little\").\n\nIn \"Doctor Who\", the Doctor uses the opening lines on regaining consciousness in the 4th Doctor story \"The Talons of Weng-Chiang\", although he misattributes them to music hall comic Harry Champion.\n\nCarter the Unstoppable Sex Machine use part of the opening in their song \"Perfect Day to Drop the Bomb\", which starts \"To the north of Kathmandu there's tiny children sniffing glue\".\n\nThe poem is parodied in Series 2 of \"Danger Mouse\" in the episode \"Bad Luck Eye of the Little Yellow God.\"\n\nTony Randall reads the poem on the episode of \"The Muppet Show\" on which he guest stars.\n\nIn an episode of the BBC sitcom \"Kiss Me Kate\", the character Craig Chapman played by Darren Boyd begins reciting the poem with actions, but is prevented from completing it when Chris Langham's Douglas Cameron character refuses to cooperate.\n\n\"Steptoe and Son\" actor Harry H. Corbett used this poem as the B-side to his 1963 Pye Records release \"Like The Big Guys Do\"\n\nIn \"I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again\" the spoof serial \"Curse of the Flying Wombat\" is based on the search for the \"Green eye of the little yellow dog\" in Kathmandu.\n\nIn an episode of \"Duty Free\", the British couples enter a talent contest in their hotel. One of their number attempts to recite the poem to the non-English speaking audience, who mistake his earnest performance for a comedy routine. Their laughter is unappreciated, making him retort: \"It's not funny! The poor bugger's dead!\" \n\n\"Biggles and the Little Green God\" (1969) has Biggles seeking a jade statuette believed by South American Indians to be the god Ata-Hua. The poem is directly referenced at the start of the book and occasionally thereafter.\n\nThe poem also has a number of references in the 1986 computer game \"Dizzy - The Ultimate Cartoon Adventure\" in which various lines of the poem are displayed in banners, where they serve as cryptic clues as to how to solve certain puzzles.\n\nIn \"The Adventure of the Six Maledictions\" by Kim Newman, Mad Carew flees to England with the emerald, pursued by the yellow god's devotees, and turns to the criminal mastermind Professor Moriarty for protection. The story was first published in \"Gaslight Arcanum\", and was subsequently collected with Newman's other Moriarty crossover stories in \"Professor Moriarty: The Hound of the D'Urbervilles\".\n\nIn the Masterpiece Theater production of \"My Mother and Other Strangers,\" most of the poem is wonderfully performed in Episode 3.\n\nIn the video game \"VVVVVV\", one of the room titles is \"Tomb of the Mad Carew.\"\n\nIn her autobiographical book, \"Moving Mountains\", Claire Bertschinger mentions having memorized this poem.\n"}

A month later he was jailed for 6 months and fined for praising Pini and Ravachol. Afterwards he wrote for Sébastien Faure's journal, \"Libertaire\", as well as for the anarchist newspaper \"La Renaissance\". In 1898, he edited \"l'Anticlérical\", for the Anticlerical League of France and was involved in supporting Alfred Dreyfus during the eponymous Dreyfus Affair.\n\nZevaco's famous cloak and dagger novels, \"Les Pardaillan\", began to be serialized in the daily newspapers in 1900 to great popular success. Yet he is today quite unknown, in spite of the new interest aroused by popular literature.\n\nA former school teacher, then an officer, he became a militant journalist, who wrote for various revolutionary newspapers, of anarchist tendency. He became famous mainly for the part he played in the anti-clerical struggles at the end of the 19th century. Then, as a writer of serial novels, he published works which had a great success in Jean Jaurès' daily \"La Petite République\", and he became appointed serial writer for \"Le Matin\" from 1906 to his death.\n\nHis already well-established popularity was made even greater by his promising beginnings as a film-director in 1917. His novels first published by Fayard and Tallandier were republished several times and adapted for the screen; the latest paperback edition only gives a mutilated version, and is impaired by many cuts.\n\nHe is remembered as the author of \"Les Pardaillan\", \"Le Capitan\", \"Le Pont des soupirs (Bridge of Sighs)\", \"Borgia\", \"Buridan\", \"L'Héroïne\", \"l'Hôtel Saint Pol\" and \"Nostradamus\", his most famous historical novels, but also published novels related to his times. Some of his serials have not yet been published.\n\nZevaco's novels, including the Les Pardaillan series, were translated into Persian as part of the great interest in historical novels in Iran. The publisher was Gutenberg Publishers, a joint project of the famous Soviet Mir Publishing House and an Iranian publisher. Following the success of the translations of the novels of Alexandre Dumas in Iran, many translators sought similar novels to translate. Among these were Zabihollah Mansouri and Manuchehr Motiei, the latter even attempting to write similar novels set in an Iranian environment. Among the novels translated were the Les Pardaillan, Fausta the Female Pope, Nostradamus, Buridan, and many other works of Zevaco. In Persian, due to a mistake, his name sometimes is written as Z-W-A-G-O which can be read as Zewago or Zouago and has caused problems. \nleader of Iran Ayatollah Khamenei has also read some novels of Zevaco and recommended them to the youths : I do not want to introduce too many books and novels to the youths, but I may name some authors. For instance, there is a well-known French author called Michel Zevaco who has written many books. I have read most of his novels in the past.\n\nIn the 1960s, many of Zevaco's historical novels were translated to Hebrew and published with considerable success by the M. Mizrahi (מ. מזרחי) publishing house in Tel Aviv . The 1963 translation of \"Le Capitan\" was by Yehoshua Kenaz, a well-known Israeli writer. However, these Hebrew translations are long out of print, and Zevaco is virtually unknown to later generations of Hebrew readers.\n\nZevaco is well known in Turkey; his most important books have been translated and published in Turkish. \"Borgia\" was translated in 1909 into Ottoman language, and printed by Hilal Matbaası. The \"Les Pardaillan\" series have appeared in many different editions, printed by Şems Matbaası in 1910s, by İNKILAP VE AKA in 1940s, by GÜVEN BASIM VE YAYINEVİ in 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, by Baskan and Oluş in 1970s. There are two new translations after 2000.\n\nSeveral of his novels have been adapted for film and television.\n\n"}

Other singles released achieved major success, including \"Water Runs Dry\", which reached No. 2, and \"Thank You\", which reached No. 21. \"Vibin'\", however, only reached No. 52.\n\nThe spoken track \"Khalil (Interlude)\" is a tribute to their road manager Khalil Roundtree who was shot in Chicago, Illinois while the band was opening for MC Hammer's \"Too Legit to Quit\" tour. \"II\" became the inaugural winner of the Grammy Award for Best R&B Album, first presented at the 37th Grammy Awards in 1995.\n\nAccording to producer Bob Robinson of the duo Tim & Bob, he and his partner Tim Kelley were asked by Boyz II Men to produce most of \"II\". However, Motown Records then-president Jheryl Busby did not feel comfortable with the idea of two unknown producers dominating a second album from a group that was one of the biggest acts in the world at the time. As a result, Busby brought in Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis and Babyface to deliver hit singles for the project. Busby insisted on \"I'll Make Love to You\" being the first single, despite objections from the group- who felt there were songs that could have been much stronger singles. The song became one of Boyz II Men's biggest hits.\n\nOver 20 songs were recorded for \"II\", but most of them never made the final track listing. Two of the songs Tim & Bob produced—\"Now That We're Done\" and \"Can I Touch You\"—ended up on 112's 1996 self-titled debut.\n\nThe album debuted at No. 1 in the \"Billboard\" 200 with 350,000 copies sold. It spent a total of five weeks at No. 1 and was the third best-selling album in 1995 in the United States and sold 12 million copies in the United States.\n\nIt did not make a huge impact in the United Kingdom, where it only made No. 17 on the UK Albums Chart. A Spanish language version, \"II: Yo Te Voy a Amar\", was also issued. The album also won Best R&B Album at the 37th Grammy Awards.\n\nNotes\n\n"}

It is named in honour of Lala Lajpat Rai, also known the Lion of Punjab, and is today most known for the Lajpat Nagar Central Market. This area is not to be confused with the Lajpat Nagar in Ghaziabad in the NCR region.\n\nThe area is divided into four parts: Lajpat Nagar I, II, III (north of the Ring Road) and IV (south of the Ring Road). Housing colonies like Amar Colony, Dayanand Colony, Double Storey (also known as Nirmal Puri), National Park and Vikram Vihar are also located in it. Lajpat Nagar is famous for its Central Market, a popular shopping destination, and also is known for the garments and textiles which are sold there.\n\nThe area falls partially under the New Delhi Lok Sabha constituency and part of it is in the South Delhi Lok Sabha constituency.\n\nLajpat Nagar was developed in the 1950s and most of its early residents were Hindus and Sikhs moving east from newly formed Pakistan following the partition of India in 1947. As such, many of these individuals are Multanis and Sindhis.. One part of Lajpat Nagar IV (Dayanand Colony) was named after Maharishi Dayanand Saraswati, by Mr. B.N. Puri in 1957.\n\nInitially, refugee camps were set up in Purana Quila, and refugees were allotted plots in areas like Lajpat Nagar, Patel Nagar, Rajendra Nagar. The plots were of 15x60 feet constructed like army barracks. The houses were all single story, with asbestos roofs, in the beginning, but now most of the houses are multi-storeyed in this neighborhood.\n\nThe colony also housed a refugee camp for Bengali widows, during the Bangladesh Liberation War, known as Kasturba Ashram. In 1960, Servants of the People Society (founded by Lala Lajpat Rai in 1921 in Lahore) after functioning for many years since Partition of India, shifted from the residence of MP Lala Achint Ram to a new building known as Lajpat Bhawan.\n\nIn the recent years, Lajpat Nagar has become a preferred residential neighborhood for tourists and certain refugees from various countries, including Afghanistan, who often travel to New Delhi as medical tourists, owing to the presence of affordable quality health care in the capital. It is common to see individuals from different parts of India, Afghanistan, Pakistan and many African countries in this neighborhood.\n\nLajpat Nagar is well connected by Delhi Transport Corporation bus services and the Delhi Mass Rapid Transit System. Route number 543 connects Anand Vihar in East Delhi to Lajpat Nagar, and Teevr Mudrika connects Lajpat Nagar to Rohini in North Delhi and Punjabi Bagh in West Delhi. The Lajpat Nagar Station of the Delhi Metro has elevated platforms lying on Delhi Metro’s Violet Line and underground platforms on Delhi Metro's Pink Line. The station was opened to the public in 2010 along with the first section of the Violet Line. A new underpass connection has been opened in 2014 below Defence Colony-Lajpat Nagar flyover between Lajpat Nagar and Jangpura for easy access to areas like Jangpura Extension, Bhogal, and Nizamuddin. The area is also connected to the Delhi Suburban Railway with the Lajpat Nagar railway station\n\n\nLajpat Nagar is home to a large Punjabi community that is featured in multiple movies.\n"}

{"id": "2163343", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2163343", "title": "Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad", "text": "Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad\n\nʿUbayd Allāh ibn Ziyād (; died August 686) was the Umayyad governor of Basra, Kufa and Khurasan during the reigns of caliphs Mu'awiya I and Yazid I, and the leading general of the Umayyad army under caliphs Marwan I and Abd al-Malik. Ubayd Allah is primarily remembered for his role in the killings of members of Ali ibn Abi Talib's family including Husayn ibn Ali, and he has become infamous in Muslim tradition.\n\nHe virtually inherited the governorships from his father Ziyad ibn Abihi after the latter's death in 673. During Ubayd Allah's governorship, he suppressed Kharijite and Alid revolts. In the ensuing Battle of Karbala in 680, Husayn and his small retinue were slain by Ubayd Allah's troops, shocking many in the Muslim community. Ubayd Allah was ultimately evicted from Iraq by the Arab tribal nobility amid the revolt of Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr.\n\nHe made it to Syria where he persuaded Marwan I to seek the caliphate and helped galvanize support for the flailing Umayyads. Afterward, he fought at the Battle of Marj Rahit in 684 against pro-Zubayrid tribes and helped reconstitute the Umayyad army. With this army he struggled against rebel Qaysi tribe in the Jazira before advancing against the Alids and Zubayrids of Iraq. However, he was slain and his forces routed at the Battle of Khazir by Ibrahim ibn al-Ashtar, the commander of the pro-Alid al-Mukhtar of Kufa.\n\nUbayd Allah was the son of Ziyad ibn Abihi whose tribal origins were obscure; Ziyad was born out of wedlock and his father was not known, while his mother was a Persian concubine named Murjanah. Ziyad served as the Umayyad governor of Iraq and the lands east of that province, collectively known as Khurasan, during the reign of Caliph Mu'awiya I (r. 661–680).\n\nUbayd Allah's father prepared Ziyad to succeed him as governor, and indeed, after Ziyad's death in 672/673, Ubayd Allah became governor of Khurasan. A year or two later, he was also appointed to the governorship of Basra. According to historian Hugh N. Kennedy, Ubayd Allah was \"more hasty and given to the use of force than his father, but a man whose devotion to the Umayyad cause could not have been doubted\".\n\nIn 674 he crossed the Amu Darya and defeated the forces of the ruler of Bukhara in the first known invasion of the city by Muslim Arabs. From at least 674 and 675, Ubayd Allah had coins struck in his name in Khurasan and Basra, respectively. They were based on Sasanian coinage and written in Pahlavi script. The mints were located in Basra, Darabjird, Maysan, Narmashir, Jayy and, to a lesser extent, Kufa. The latter was attached to Ubayd Allah's governorship in 679/680, giving him full control of Iraq.\n\nMu'awiya died in 680 and was succeeded by his son Yazid I. Mu'awiya's designation of his son was an unprecedented act and shocked many in the Muslim community, particularly the Arab nobility of Kufa. They long sympathized with Caliph Ali, Mu'awiya's former rival, and Ali's family. One of Ali's sons, Husayn dispatched his cousin Muslim ibn Aqil to Kufa to set the stage for Husayn's accession to the caliphate. Ibn Aqil garnered significant support and was hosted by a prominent pro-Alid nobleman. Ubayd Allah became aware of Ibn Aqil's activities, prompting the latter to launch a premature assault against the governor. Ubayd Allah was holed up in his palace, but thirty men from his \"shurta\" (security forces) fended off Ibn Aqil's partisans, allowing Ubayd Allah to escape. He then persuaded many Kufan noblemen to back him against Ibn Aqil, who was abandoned by his supporters and slain on 10 September 680.\n\nHusayn had already been en route to Kufa from Medina when he received news of Ibn Aqil's execution. Ubayd Allah was prepared for Husayn's arrival and sent troops to intercept him. They prevented Husayn and his small retinue from reaching the watered areas of the province. The two sides negotiated for weeks, but Ubayd Allah refused Husayn entry into Kufa while Husayn refused to recognize Yazid's caliphate or return to Arabia. In the end, a short battle was fought at Karbala on 10 October 680, in which Husayn and nearly all of his partisans were slain. Husayn had never received the expected backing of his Kufan sympathizers, but the latter's resentment festered as a result of his death. The slaying of Husayn, a grandson of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, perturbed many Muslims.\n\nThe death of Yazid in 683 led to a major leadership crisis in the caliphate, and \"the power of his house seemed to collapse everywhere\", in the words of Orientalist Julius Wellhausen. Ubayd Allah initially neglected to support Yazid's son and designated successor, Mu'awiya II and secured oaths of allegiance to himself from the Basran Arab nobility. In a speech addressed to them, he emphasized his connection to Basra and promised to maintain the wealth of the city's inhabitants. Nonetheless, the Basrans turned against him, forcing him to abandon his palace. He was replaced by Abd Allah ibn al-Harith, a member of the Banu Hashim. Ubayd Allah took refuge with the Azdi chieftain Mas'ud ibn Amr in late 683 or early 684. He plotted to restore his governorship by encouraging Mas'ud to form an alliance of the Yamani and Rabi'a tribes against his opponents from the Banu Tamim and Ibn al-Harith. Mas'ud took to the pulpit of Basra's mosque to stir up the revolt, but Tamimi tribesmen, under Ibn al-Harith's direction, stormed the building and killed Mas'ud. After Mas'ud's death, Ubayd Allah fled the city practically alone in March 684, taking the Syrian desert route to Hawran or Palmyra. In his rush to escape, he left his wife and family behind.\n\nWhen Ubayd Allah arrived in Syria, he found it in political disarray; Caliph Mu'awiya II had died weeks into his rule and a power vacuum ensued with many Syrian noblemen, particularly from the Qaysi tribes, switching allegiance to the rival, Mecca-based caliphate of Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr. The latter had expelled the Umayyads from the Hejaz and among the exiles to Syria was Marwan ibn al-Hakam, an Umayyad elder. Ubayd Allah persuaded Marwan, who was preparing to recognize Ibn al-Zubayr's sovereignty, to enter his candidacy as Mu'awiya II's successor. The Umayyads' principal Syrian allies, the Banu Kalb, had sought to maintain Umayyad rule and nominated Mu'awiya II's half-brother Khalid as caliph. However, the other pro-Umayyad Syrian tribes viewed Khalid as too young and inexperienced, and rallied around Marwan, who was ultimately chosen as caliph.\n\nUbayd Allah fought for Marwan and his tribal allies against the Qaysi tribes led by al-Dahhak ibn Qays al-Fihri, the governor of Damascus, at the Battle of Marj Rahit in August 684. The Qays were routed and al-Dahhak killed. Ubayd Allah was put in command of Marwan's army which, during Marj Rahit, consisted 6,000 men from a handful of loyalist tribes. According to Kennedy, Ubayd Allah \"clearly intended to rebuild the Syrian army which had served Mu'awiya and Yazid I so well\". In the aftermath of Marj Rahit, Ubayd Allah oversaw campaigns against rebel Qaysi tribes for Marwan and his son and successor Abd al-Malik (r. 685–705) in the Jazira. However, Marwan's forces were too little to assert Umayyad rule throughout the caliphate. Thus, Ubayd Allah expanded recruitment to include various Qaysi tribes. He placed Husayn ibn Numayr al-Sakuni of Kindah as his second-in-command, and Shurahbil ibn Dhi'l-Kila' of Himyar, Adham ibn Muhriz of Bahila, al-Rabi'a ibn Mukhariq of Banu Ghani and Jabala ibn Abd Allah of Khath'am as deputy commanders. Other than Husayn ibn Numayr, all the other commanders were either Qaysi or had earlier supported al-Dahhak against Marwan.\n\nIn January 685, as Ubayd Allah was in Manbij preparing for the Umayyad reconquest of Iraq, Husayn ibn Numayr defeated the pro-Alid Penitents at the Battle of Ayn al-Warda. Ubayd Allah had been promised by Marwan the governorship over all of the lands he could conquer from the Alids and Ibn al-Zubayr, and he may have been sanctioned to plunder Kufa. For the following year, Ubayd Allah was bogged down in battles with the Qaysi tribes of Jazira led by Zufar ibn al-Harith al-Kilabi. By 686, Ubayd Allah's army numbered some 60,000 troops.\n\nBy the time Ubayd Allah's army approached Mosul toward Iraq, the Zubayrids under Mus'ab ibn al-Zubayr had established themselves in Basra while al-Mukhtar ibn Ubayd took control of Kufa in the name of the Alid Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya. Al-Mukhtar dispatched Ibrahim ibn al-Ashtar and an army composed largely of non-Arab freedmen to confront Ubayd Allah. The latter fended off the first wave of al-Mukhtar's troops, and proceeded to face off Ibn al-Ashtar at the Khazir River. In the ensuing Battle of Khazir, the Umayyad army was routed and Ubayd Allah was slain by Ibn al-Ashtar. His commanders Husayn, Shurahbil and al-Rabi'a were also killed. With Ubayd Allah's death, Caliph Abd al-Malik halted further advances against Iraq until 691.\nDeath\n\nAt the Battle of Khazir, Ubayd was eventually decapitated, and his severed head was brought to a royal gathering of the people of al-Mukhtar. On seeing the decapitated head, people started screaming in terror, for a snake suddenly appeared and entered the skull of Ubayd, entering through the nostril and resided inside for a while. It exited and then did the same thing twice more.\n\n\n\n"}

Caliph Ali () appointed Ziyad to Fars to suppress a local rebellion and he maintained his loyalty to Ali's caliphate after the latter's assassination in 661 and the subsequent rule of Ali's enemy, Mu'awiya I (). The latter ultimately overcame Ziyad's opposition, formally recognized him as his own paternal half-brother and appointed him governor of Basra. Ziyad's inaugural speech, in which he announced his carrot-and-stick policies to the city's turbulent population, is celebrated in Arab history for its eloquence. After the death of Kufa's governor, Ziyad's mentor al-Mughira ibn Shu'ba, Mu'awiya made Ziyad the first governor of a unified Iraqi province. He administratively reorganized the garrison cities and minted Sasanian-style silver dirhams in his own name. He firmly established Arab power and recommenced conquests in the Caliphate's easternmost province of Khurasan by relocating there 50,000 Arab soldiers and their families from Iraq and dispatching expeditionary forces against Tukharistan, Balkh and Quhistan. Though the mass resettlement improved Iraq's economic and political conditions by siphoning off Arab tribal soldiers from the overcrowded garrisons and creating new opportunities for war spoils, the move had major ramifications for the Caliphate as the descendants of these Khurasani Arab troops formed the army that toppled the Umayyads in 750. \n\nZiyad died near Kufa in 673, but his sons Ubayd Allah, Abd al-Rahman, Salm, Abbad and Yazid went on to hold posts as governors or deputy governors of Iraq, Khurasan and Sijistan. Ziyad was the subject of early Arabic biographies and is remembered in Arab history as one of the four great wise men of his era and as a highly skilled administrator and orator. His administration in Iraq served as a model for his successors.\n\nZiyad was likely born in Ta'if in 622 or 623/24. His precise parentage is obscure, hence his frequent name in the sources as \"Ziyād ibn Abīhi\" (\"Ziyad son of his father\"). He was the illegitimate son of a certain Sumayya, his father being unknown. The origins of Sumayya are also obscure. The 9th-century historians al-Baladhuri and Awana ibn al-Hakam both relate that she had been a slave living in Kashkar, though the former asserts she belonged to a member of the Banu Yashkur, a branch of the Arab tribe of Banu Bakr, and the latter states she belonged to a Persian \"dehqan\" (landowning magnate). In the narrative of al-Baladhuri, Sumayya's Yashkuri owner embarked on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca seeking to cure his illness and was subsequently treated in Ta'if by al-Harith ibn Kalada, a physician from the Thaqif clan resident in the city; as a reward for his services, Ibn Kalada was gifted Sumayya. In Awana's narrative, Sumayya was given to Ibn Kalada by the Persian \"dehqan\" after he treated him. In any case, she was ultimately given to Ubayd, a Greek or Syrian slave belonging to Ibn Kalada's wife. Though Ziyad alludes to his Persian origin in a poem, his family claimed that Sumayya was not a slave, but the daughter of a certain al-A'war from the Zayd Manat clan of the Arab tribe of Banu Tamim.\n\nDuring the reign of Caliph Abu Bakr (), Ziyad embraced Islam, which \"opened the world to him\", according to historian Julius Wellhausen. He later became one of the first settlers of the Arab garrison town of Basra. Before the city's founding in 638, the Muslim troops fighting on the Iraqi front used as their military camp the ruined Persian village on the site. Ziyad arrived there with the sons of Ibn Kalada, Nafi and Abu Bakra Nufay. The latter's family gained preeminence in the city, having acquired large landholdings there. Abu Bakra's brother-in-law Utba ibn Ghazwan al-Mazini had established the initial camp at Basra in 635 and was the founder and first governor of the city. The administrative skills of Ziyad became apparent from the time of his adolescence and Utba charged him with minor tasks in the Basran \"dīwān\" (bureaucracy) during the reign of Caliph Umar (). In 635, Utba tasked him with distributing to the Arab troops the war spoils from the capture of al-Ubulla (Apologos), a town immediately east of Basra. According to the modern historian Isaac Hasson, Ziyad \"distinguished himself as an intelligent and open-minded secretary, who was devoted to his master and to public service ... he showed an unusual aptitude for accounting and had an excellent command of epistolary art\". His skills and his assignment by Basra's military governor Abu Musa al-Ash'ari as his acting replacement while he was on a military campaign gained the attention of Caliph Umar. He brought Ziyad to Medina, the center of the nascent Muslim state, where he further tested his skills; Ziyad's performance earned him a reward of 1,000 silver dirhams by Umar, which he used to purchase the freedom of his mother or his stepfather Ubayd. Soon after his return to Basra, Ziyad was made Utba's \"kātib\" (scribe or secretary).\n\nAfter Utba's death, Ziyad continued his service as \"kātib\" under his successors Abu Musa al-Ash'ari and al-Mughira ibn Shu'ba, a member of the Thaqif who became Ziyad's mentor. When al-Mughira was recalled by Umar to Medina in 638 due to charges of adultery by three accusers, including Abu Bakra Nufay and a certain Shibl ibn Ma'bad al-Bajali, both of whom were Ziyad's maternal half-brothers, Ziyad was also recalled to give his own testimony. His statement was partial toward al-Mughira and as a result, the charges were dismissed and the accusers were flogged. During the reign of Caliph Uthman (), Ziyad served the caliph's appointee to Basra, Abd Allah ibn Amir.\n\nUthman's successor Ali () appointed Abd Allah ibn Abbas governor of Basra and entrusted Ziyad with collection of the province's \"kharāj\" (land tax) and supervision of the treasury. According to Hasson, \"Ali's appreciation of Ziyad's talents were so great\" that he mandated Ibn Abbas heed Ziyad's counsel. When Ibn Abbas left Basra in 657 to accompany Ali at the Battle of Siffin against the governor of Syria, Mu'awiya ibn Abi Sufyan, he left Ziyad as his acting governor. During this period, he stamped out an uprising by the Banu Tamim, a major military tribal faction in the city, with critical assistance from another Basran faction, the Azd. \n\nAfter Ali returned from Siffin, his appointee to the district of Fars, Sahl ibn Hunayf, was ousted by its inhabitants, after which he dispatched Ziyad. The people of Fars were satisfied with Ziyad's leadership and he was able to collect the district's \"kharāj\". He remained in Fars through the remainder of Ali's rule, which ended with the caliph's assassination in 661 and the foundation of the Umayyad Caliphate under Mu'awiya. Afterward, he remained headquartered in a fortress in the vicinity of Istakhr. Of Ali's appointees, he held out the longest from recognizing Mu'awiya's caliphate. Mu'awiya's agent, Busr ibn Abi Artat, pressured Ziyad by capturing and threatening to kill three of his sons in Basra. Ziyad's half-brother Abu Bakra interceded with Mu'awiya and Ziyad's sons were released. He finally surrendered to Mu'awiya's rule in 662/63 after the intercession of al-Mughira, who Mu'awiya had appointed governor of Kufa, the other main Arab garrison town of Iraq. In the deal reached, the revenues from Fars owed to the caliphal treasury were split between Ziyad and al-Mughira, which Mu'awiya ignored. Ziyad moved to Kufa and maintained intimate ties with al-Mughira and his family.\n\nMu'awiya formally recognized Ziyad as a son of his father Abu Sufyan. The motion was initiated when Ziyad sought clarification from the caliph about rumors of Abu Sufyan's biological paternity. According to Wellhausen, Mu'awiya summoned Ziyad to Damascus and recognized him as his paternal half-brother, \"so as to bind him in this way absolutely to himself and to his family\". The decision was seen as scandalous by the Umayyad ruling family. Mu'awiya's son Yazid and members from other branches of the clan, namely the extended family of Marwan ibn al-Hakam in Medina and Abd Allah ibn Amir, the governor of Basra, protested or threatened action against the decision. Ibn Amir and the Marwanids were silenced as a result of threats of force or bribes. Yazid's relations with Ziyad remained strained and satirical poetic verses about the event were spread by Marwan's brother Abd al-Rahman. Muslim scholars generally viewed the episode as one of Mu'awiya's most disreputable actions.\n\nRealizing that Ziyad \"had both the abilities and the all-important local connections to be his right-hand man in Basra\", Mu'awiya appointed him governor of the province, according to the historian Hugh N. Kennedy. He entered office in June or July 665, issuing an inaugural carrot-and-stick speech to Basra's restless population. According to Hasson it was \"considered a masterpiece of eloquence\". Wellhausen describes it as \"celebrated\" and the one which was called a \"[speech] without a preface\" because it skipped the traditional introductions praising God and blessing the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The speech is translated as follows: Ye are putting relationship before religion, ye are excusing and sheltering your criminals, and tearing down the protecting laws sanctified by Islam. Beware of prowling by night; I will kill every one who is found at night in the streets. Beware of the arbitrary summons of relationship; I will cut out the tongue of every one who raises the cry. Whoever pushes anyone into the water, whoever sets fire to another's house, whoever breaks into a house, whoever opens a grave, him will I punish for it. I make every family responsible for those belonging to it. Hatred towards myself I do not punish, but only crime. Many who are terrified at my coming will be glad of my presence, and many who are building their hopes upon it will be undeceived. I rule you with the authority of God and care for your maintenance out of the wealth of God. From you I demand obedience, and ye can demand from me justice. In whatsoever I fall short, three things there are in which I shall not be lacking: at any time I shall be ready to listen to anyone; I shall pay you your pension at the proper time, and I shall not send you to war too far away or keep you in the field overlong. Do not let yourselves be carried away by your hatred and wrath against me ; it would go ill with you if ye did. Many heads do I see tottering; let each man see to it that his own remains on his shoulders! \n\nA number of punitive measures along the lines of those cited in his speech were taken by Ziyad at the start of his term and largely gained for him the Basrans' respect. He established unprecedented levels of security in the city, its Iranian dependencies to the east, i.e. Fars and Kerman, and the Arabian Desert to the south. The Kharijites of Basra, many of whom were concerned more with banditry than politics, submitted to his authority. Under Ziyad, Basra began to take shape as a proper Islamic city. His rule saw the crude mud bricks of the city's homes replaced by more durable baked bricks and he built a congregational mosque and residential palace. In the words of the historian Charles Pellat, Ziyad, \"to a certain degree, [may] be considered as the artisan of the town's prosperity\". His effective rule cemented Mu'awiya's confidence in him. In the same year that Ziyad was appointed to Basra, the province of Bahrayn (eastern Arabia) and its dependency, the Yamama (central Arabia), were attached to Ziyad's governorship.\n\nAfter the death of al-Mughira in 670, Kufa and its dependencies were attached to Ziyad's governorship, making him the practical viceroy over Iraq and the eastern half of the Caliphate. He was the first to serve as the dual governor of Kufa and Basra and divided his residence between the two towns. In the winter he stayed in Basra and left Amr ibn Hurayth as his deputy in Kufa, while he resided in Kufa in the summer, leaving Samura ibn Jundab as his deputy in Basra. His strong grip in Kufa marked a shift from al-Mughira's hands-off approach. A source of disturbance for him in Kufa was the agitation of the Alids, partisans of Caliph Ali, led by Hujr ibn Adi al-Kindi, who disapproved of Umayyad rule and led the first open calls for the caliphate to be held by Ali's progeny. Though al-Mughira tolerated Hujr, Ziyad issued a number of dire warnings to cease his open dissent. He succeeded in turning most of Hujr's supporters among the Kufan troops against him. In 671, he had Hujr and thirteen of his loyalists arrested and sent to Damascus for punishment, where six, including Hujr, were executed in Adra for their refusal to renounce support for the Alids. One of the men, Abd al-Rahman ibn Hassan al-Anazi, who was spared by Mu'awiya later insulted the caliph after refusing his invocation to condemn Ali and was sent back to Ziyad, who had him buried alive as punishment.\n\nTo end the chaos in the \"amṣar\" (garrisons) of Basra and Kufa, Ziyad administratively reformed the two towns. From the reign of Caliph Umar, their garrisons consisted of soldiers from different tribes who were grouped together for the distribution of military stipends. There were seven such tribal groups in Kufa and Basra and at the head of each group was a chieftain chosen by its members who served as their representative to the government. Gradually, this system had become economically inefficient and politically turbulent. There was no control on Arab immigration into the \"amṣar\", resulting in overpopulation and in turn, increased competition over fewer resources. Ziyad thus resolved to form larger divisions by unifying related clans and personally appointing their leader, which resulted in Kufa's reorganization into quarters and Basra into fifths. This measure enabled easier control of the two towns' inhabitants. Ziyad undertook further reforms in Kufa and Basra, including regularizing the timely payment of stipends, embarking on agricultural development schemes, including canal digging, and minting Sasanian-style dirhams that bore his name as \"Ziyad ibn Abi Sufyan\".\n\nZiyad's authority extended to Khurasan and Sijistan, the far eastern regions of the Caliphate which were considered dependencies of the Basra garrison. The Arab conquests of these areas in the 640s and 650s were akin to raids and did not firmly establish the Caliphate's power. Moreover, the political instability of the final years of Uthman's caliphate and the First Muslim Civil War saw local revolts which further weakened Arab authority. In 655, the Sasanian prince Peroz III, backed by the army of Tukharistan, attempted to reassert Persian power. Under previous caliphs, the vast region had been experimentally divided into separate provinces under the leadership of Arab tribal chiefs. Governance was largely left to local princes. Fearing a Persian resurgence, which a fragmentary division of Khurasan could afford, Ziyad centralized the administration of the province in the small Arab garrison at Merv. \n\nTo relieve Basra's fiscal pressures, Ziyad recommenced the Muslim conquests in Central Asia. He organized the Arab military presence in Khurasan. In 667, he dispatched an army to the region under his lieutenant general al-Hakam ibn Amr al-Ghifari. The latter conquered lower Tukharistan and Gharchistan and temporarily crossed the Oxus river into Transoxiana, forcing Peroz to withdraw into Tang China. Meanwhile, Ziyad's removal of dead soldiers and input of new recruits to the Iraqi army registers led to numerous tribesmen being taken off the payrolls. He dispatched 50,000 Arab soldiers and their families from Basra and Kufa to permanently settle in the Merv oasis of Khurasan. The resettlement of these troops may have been a means \"to defuse possibly dangerous developments\" relating to the Arab tribal influx in the two garrison towns, according to the historian Gerald Hawting. As a result, the Merv oasis became home to the largest concentration of Muslims outside of the Fertile Crescent. \n\nAl-Hakam's successor, Ghalib ibn Abd Allah al-Laythi, was less successful in subduing Tukharistan and Ziyad sent another of his lieutenants, Rabi ibn Ziyad al-Harithi, to stamp out the revolts in the conquered areas in 670/71. Rabi proceeded to secure the capitulation of Balkh, whose inhabitants had revolted against Arab rule, in a treaty and then destroyed the army of the Hepthalite princes in Quhistan. In 673, Rabi's son Abd Allah extended Arab rule to the western banks of the Oxus and established tributary agreements with the fortress towns of Amul and Zamm. To solidify the territorial gains and supply the manpower for further conquests Ziyad intended for the Arab troops, initially concentrated in the Merv oasis, to colonize other parts of Khurasan. They were ultimately distributed between five regional garrisons under Ziyad's successors.\n\nZiyad died in the village of al-Thawiyya near Kufa on 23 August 673. He was buried in a cemetery there that contained the graves of several Qurayshites and left an inheritance of 10,000 silver dirhams. During his governorship of Kufa in 675–678, al-Dahhak ibn Qays al-Fihri visited Ziyad's grave and recited an elegy: If nobility and Islam ever immortalized a human being, They would certainly immortalize you. A year after his death, Mu'awiya appointed Ziyad's son Ubayd Allah as governor of Khurasan and then Basra. Under Mu'awiya's son and successor, Caliph Yazid I (), the governorship of Kufa was also handed to Ubayd Allah. Ziyad's sons Abd al-Rahman and Salm served successively as governors of Khurasan in 678–680 and 680–683/84, and two other sons, Abbad and Yazid, served successively as governors of Sijistan in 673–680/81 and 680/81. The Thaqif, which had maintained close ties with the Umayyads since the pre-Islamic era and played an integral role in the Muslim conquest of Iraq, provided the Umayyad dynasty with a series of viceroys in Iraq, including al-Mughira, Ziyad, Ubayd Allah and al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf (), and the Muslim traditional sources devote more attention to them than the caliphs on whose behalf they ruled. Along with his mentor al-Mughira, Ziyad and his family were part of what \"some must have seen as a Thaqafi mafia\" controlling Iraq and the east, according to Kennedy. \n\nAmong \"the most gifted governors of the Umayyad era\", Ziyad \"had a good understanding of his task as governor, and had a great influence on his successors concerning the conception of the duties of rulers\", according to Hasson. According to Kennedy, Ziyad's settlement of Iraqi Arab troops in Khurasan had \"extremely important consequences for Islamic history\" as the descendants of those settlers, who were known as \"ahl Khurāsān\", ultimately destroyed the Umayyad Caliphate as part of the Abbasid army in 750. The execution of Hujr and his six partisans, all of whom had been prominent men in their own right, also led to deep-seated resentment among their Kufan kinsmen. The incident would serve as a harbinger for future pro-Alid risings. The death of Hujr represented the first political execution in Islamic history, and he and his companions are viewed as martyrs by Shia Muslims. Ziyad was alleged to have ordered cruel acts against some Alid partisans, including crucifixions.\n\nInterest in Ziyad's biography emerged early on among the traditional Muslim historians, with works written about him by Abu Mikhnaf (d. 774), Hisham ibn al-Kalbi (d. 819) and Abd al-Aziz ibn Yahya al-Jaludi (d. 943). He is considered a highly skilled orator among Arabs, with his inaugural speech and fragments of other speeches and sayings cited in Islamic literature and Arabic rhetoric, polemics and histories. He is counted alongside Mu'awiya, al-Mughira and Amr ibn al-As, the conqueror and governor of Egypt, as one of the four \"duhāt\" (i.e. \"shrewds\") among the Arab statesmen of his era. According to the medieval Syrian historian Ibn Asakir (d. 1176), Ziyad had expert knowledge of the Qur'an, its tenets and Islamic jurisprudence. A medieval Basran historian, Muhammad ibn Imran al-Abdi, related that Ziyad respected and enjoyed listening to the hadiths about Umar and proclaimed about them: \"This is the truth we hear! This is the sunna!\" Ziyad is credited by a number of sources for transmitting sayings by the Islamic prophet Muhammad through Umar as the original transmitter. In 777 the Abbasid authorities stripped Ziyad's descendants of their status as official members of the Quraysh (the tribe to which the Umayyads and Abbasids belonged) in the \"dīwān\" rolls, which entitled them to relatively high pensions, and declared them part of Thaqif, whose members were paid less. At some point afterward, they were reinstated as Quraysh as a result of bribing government officials.\n\nZiyad had numerous wives and \"ummahat awlad\" (slave women who bore children; sing. \"umm walad\"). He had twenty sons and twenty-three daughters, most of whom were the children of \"ummahat awlad\". From his first wife Mu'adha bint Sakhr of the Banu Uqayl tribe Ziyad had four sons, including Muhammad and Abd al-Rahman, who respectively married daughters of Caliph Mu'awiya I and the latter's brother Utba. His other Arab wives were Lubaba bint Awf al-Harashiyya, the daughter of a Basran noble, whose brother Zurara was a prominent Muslim jurist and one-time qadi (Islamic head judge) of Basra on Ziyad's behalf; an unnamed daughter of al-Qa'qa ibn Ma'bad ibn Zurara, a chieftain of the Darim clan of the Banu Tamim tribe who was credited for leading his tribe's first delegation to the Islamic prophet Muhammad; an unnamed daughter of Muhajir ibn Hakim ibn Taliq ibn Sufyan, a fifth-generation descendant of the Umayyad clan's progenitor Umayya ibn Abd Shams; and an unnamed woman from the Khuza'a tribe. Ziyad was also married for a time to a Sasanian Persian princess, Marjana (or Manjana), who mothered his son Ubayd Allah; she later remarried a Persian commander of Ziyad called Shiruyah al-Uswari.\n\nZiyad's daughter Ramla was a wife of the Umayyad prince Umayya, son of Ziyad's deputy governor of Fars province or its Ardashir-Khurrah district and later his deputy governor of Kufa, Abdallah ibn Khalid ibn Asid, who led Ziyad's funeral prayers and served as Kufa's governor until 675. Ziyad had successively appointed Umayya as the deputy governor of Khuzistan and al-Ubulla. Ziyad's daughter Sakhra was married to a noble of the Qurayshite Makhzum clan, Ubaydallah ibn Abd al-Rahman ibn al-Harith, a great-grandson of Hisham ibn al-Mughira.\n\n"}

{"id": "2163353", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2163353", "title": "Mumbo Jumbo (novel)", "text": "Mumbo Jumbo (novel)\n\nMumbo Jumbo is a 1972 novel by African-American author Ishmael Reed. \"Mumbo Jumbo\" has remained in print for 45 years, since its first edition, and has been published in French, Italian, Spanish, Japanese, and British editions, with a Chinese translation currently in production.\n\nSet in 1920s New York City, the novel depicts the elderly Harlem houngan PaPa LaBas and his companion Black Herman racing against the Wallflower Order, an international conspiracy dedicated to monotheism and control, as they attempt to root out the cause of and deal with the \"Jes Grew\" virus, a personification of ragtime, jazz, polytheism, and freedom. The Wallflower Order is said to work in concert with a still-existent Knights Templar Order to prevent people from dancing, to end the dance crazes spreading among black people. The virus is spread by certain black artists, referred to in the novel as \"Jes Grew Carriers\" or \"J.G.C.s.\"\n\nHistorical, social, and political events mingle freely with fictional inventions. The United States' occupation of Haiti, attempts by whites to suppress jazz music, and the widespread belief that president Warren Harding had black ancestry are mingled with a plot in which the novel's hero, PaPa LaBas, searches for a mysterious book that has disappeared with black militant Abdul Sufi Hamid (whose name reflects that of the Harlem streetcorner radical preacher Sufi Abdul Hamid, a.k.a. Eugene Brown, an early black convert to Islam), as a group of radicals plans to return museum treasures looted from ancient Egypt to Africa, and the Atonists within the Wallflower Order are trying to locate and train the perfect \"Talking Android,\" a black man who will renounce African-American culture in favor of European American culture. One of the supporting characters, an ally of Papa La Bas, is Black Herman (Bejamin Rucker, 1892–1934), an actual African-American stage magician and root doctor. Another touch of realism is the inclusion of a mysterious ocean liner that is part of the Black Star Line, a shipping line incorporated by Marcus Garvey, who organized the United Negro Improvement Association. Portions of the action take place at the \"Villa Lewaro\" mansion built by Madame C. J. Walker overlooking the Hudson River and at the Harlem townhouse of her daughter A'Lelia Walker, known as \"The Dark Tower\", located at 136th Street near Lenox Avenue. Other famous people who appear in the novel include the dance instructor Irene Castle, and the Harlem renaissance authors James Weldon Johnson, Claude McKay, Wallace Thurman, Countee Cullen, W. E. B. Du Bois, and a veiled reference to Malcolm X.\n\nAdditionally, in his project of blending the \"real\" and the \"invented,\" Reed, through Papa LaBas, recites a counter history of The Bible, whose content transforms the normative understanding of Judeo-Christian roots. Featuring Osiris, Seth, Moses and other important figures in both Egyptian and Judeo-Christian mythology, Reed re-imagines an entirely alternate past, evidenced by the Templar conflict that takes place in the novel.\n\nGiven that the protagonists of the novel are Voodoo practitioners, the novel itself contains a great deal of Voodoo terminology. In the novel, Voodoo is an effective art: PaPa LaBas practices from his Mumbo Jumbo Kathedral, and at one point his assistant is taken over by a loa whom she has neglected to feed. Voodoo itself is traced back to sharing a common ancestor with Judeo-Christianity in ancient Egypt, with Osiris as the first recipient of Jes Grew, whose effects and powers are interchangeable with that of Voodoo. Moses steals the Petro aspect of the Voodoo secrets from Isis. Other classic mythological figures include Dionysus, who is portrayed as a follower of Osiris, and Faust, who receives his magic not through a deal with the devil but through connections with black Voodoo practicitioners.\n\nThere are a variety of ways to approach \"Mumbo Jumbo\" as a reader. Of course, there is the conventional methodology: treat it as any other novel would be treated. However, given that Reed describes his own work as a form of poetic conjuring through \"Neo-HooDoo,\" it is possible to approach the text as a spiritual artifact, a relic imbued with spiritual powers within the tradition of Neo-HooDoo. In order to investigate these modes of relating to the text spiritually, it is suggested that readers educate themselves about Nkisi and Mojo bags, two possible models of sacred objects within African-derived religions. \n\n\"Mumbo Jumbo\" draws freely on conspiracy theory, hoodoo, and voodoo traditions, as well as the Afrocentric theories of Marcus Garvey and the occult author Henri Gamache, especially Gamache's theory that the Biblical prophet Moses was black. The book's title is explained by a quote from the first edition of the \"American Heritage Dictionary\" deriving the phrase from Mandingo \"mā-mā-gyo-mbō\" meaning a \"magician who makes the troubled spirits of ancestors go away.\"\n\nThe format and typography of \"Mumbo Jumbo\" are unique and make allusion to several typographic and stylistic conventions not normally associated with novels. The text begins and ends as if it were a movie script, with credits, a fade-in, and a freeze-frame followed by the publication and title pages which occur after chapter one. This is followed by a closing section that mimics a scholarly book on social history or folk magic by citing a lengthy bibliography. In addition, the tale is illustrated with drawings, photographs, and collages, some of which relate to the text, some of which look like illustrations from a social-studies book on African-American history, and some of which seem to be included as a cryptic protest against the Vietnam War.\n\n\"Mumbo Jumbo\" both depends on and fosters the disorientation of the reader. Rather than stick to any semblance of a novel's conventions, Reed supplies us with a hodgepodge of hand-written letters, radio dispatches, photographs, various typefaces, drawings, and even footnotes. With the first and second chapters interrupted by copyright and title pages, we even get the sense we're looking at a cinematic title screen. This is all to say that Reed is constantly blurring the lines of those things traditionally understood as distinct—in this case, form. In this vein he seems adamant to defamiliarize the familiar.\n\nIt is interesting how many of these conventions are taken up, and then altered, and yet some still seem so difficult (or unwilling by the author) to get around. Particularly, while thinking of the female characters in the novel, loas, and of the author's knowledge of vodou, is there indeed a sort of failure, (or an ellipsis) on Reed's part, or perhaps western convention is indeed too much to overcome or to challenge completely.\n\nScholars such as Alondra Nelson have considered Reed's text as an Afrofuturist text because of the synchronization of voodoo tropes and technology which contributes to its unique form. \"Reed's synchronous model defies the progressive linearity of much recent technocultural criticism\" (Nelson 8). The non-linear narration, which is cinematic, plays on Afrofuturism's relationship between technology, black magic, and race—to whit: Also, Nelson deals with Reed's use of technology and its functionality in the text. The \"…technologies from the setting's future and the author's present inhabit a story situated in the past,\" in \"Mumbo Jumbo\" allows for the emergence of African diasporic technologies in the text. This \"anachronistic\" nature of \"Mumbo Jumbo\" troubles widely accepted conceptualizations of technology, especially in thinking about \"when\" cultural innovations were created and by \"whom.\"\n\nJames A. Snead sees the novel's structure as engaged of the African-American musical and rhetorical trope of \"the cut\", an interruption that disrupts the linear temporality of the work, looping back to an earlier textual moment. Neil Schmitz's investigates the Reed's experimentation with Neo Hoodoo where the writer does not use it as a literary form but as a \"characteristic stance, a mythological provenace, a behavior, a complex, of attitudes, the retrieval of an idiom...\" (Schmitz 127). Analyzing \"Mumbo Jumbo\" as a \"signifying pastiche of Afro-American narrative tradition\" Henry Louis Gates posits that Reed's novel opens up a narrative space in which the intricate relationship between black and Western literary forms and conventions are critiqued. Pushing Gates' notion of \"signifying pastiche\" into the realm of the Afrofuturism, Alondra Nelson holds that Mumbo Jumbo imagines a version of African Diaspora that refuses to detach from tradition as it navigates modernity. For instance, PaPa LaBas make sense of the nuances of black modernity through his use of Haitian \"Hoodoo\" practices. As such, Reed mobilizes a \"future-primitive perspective\", which animates the past through the future.\n\nThroughout the novel, Reed seeks to deconstruct the fundamental foundations upon which white, western civilization rests. This is exemplified by the Mu'tafika, an organization whose sole purpose is to steal historical artifacts from Western museums and return them to their place of origin. Additionally, the primary manifestation of this occurs in Papa LaBas' 30-page story of The Work (the original practice emanating from the text from which Jes Grew came) and its Egyptian roots. Reed uses this history to explicitly undermine the legitimacy of the monotheistic religions on which Western civilization rest. More important, though, is the fact that it does not matter whether or not the reader believes the tale to be true; what matters instead, for Reed, is the fact that an entire population was denied the right to hear his history and the right to choose to believe it. With the framework of Jes Grew already established as a real phenomenon in the novel, Reed's 30-page history imagines a powerful origin and meaning that has, in the course of the African-American slavery experience, been strategically precluded.\n\nIn \"Mumbo Jumbo\", Reed speaks of the creation of an intrinsically \"black text\", which is manifested in \"Jes Grew\". \"Jes Grew\", Reed's \"virus\", alludes to the dissemination of uniquely African-American culture in the 1920s that \"traversed the land in search of its Text: the lost liturgy seeking its litany\". The \"Jes Grew\" virus influences people to listen to music, dance, and be happy. In many ways Jes Grew is like the funk. The infectious virus ultimately gets suppressed at the end of the plot of the novel. However, at the end of the novel, when Papa Labas is speaking to a college classroom in the 1970s, he talks about how the '70s are like the '20s again. He believes this is the time for Jes Grew to rise. In this instance Papa Labas taps into a similarity between the styles of music that Jes Grew needs to grow; '20s jazz and '70s funk share an aesthetic that calls people to dance. Jes Grew needs the physical expression of music to grow.\n\nThe ZBS Foundation dramatized the novel for a 1980 radio drama of the same name directed by Thomas Lopez.\n\nParliament-Funkadelic leader George Clinton has cited \"Mumbo Jumbo\" as a primary source of inspiration for his P-Funk mythology.\n\nIn Thomas Pynchon's \"Gravity's Rainbow\", a remark by the narrator places Reed in the heart of postmodern intertextuality, saying: \"Well, and keep in mind where those Masonic Mysteries came from in the first place. (Check out Ishmael Reed. He knows more about it than you will ever find here.)\"\n\n"}

Salcido started his career as a left-back, then converted to defensive midfielder, and ended it as a central defender.\n\nAfter emerging through Guadalajara's youth system, he went on to be a mainstay for PSV Eindhoven, acting as vice-captain for the Dutch team and was the first player from Mexico to be champion in the Eredivise. Salcido also played a season for Fulham before returning to Mexico with Tigres UANL. In 2014 he returned to Guadalajara, winning the league title with the club in 2017. \n\nInternationally, Salcido competed with the Mexico national team in three World Cups: 2006, 2010, 2014 and three Gold Cups: 2005, 2007, 2011, He was a member of Mexico's team that won the gold medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics. He made his first national team appearance at the age of 24 in 2004. In 2014, after the World Cup in Brazil, Salcido officially retired from the national team.\n\nCarlos Salcido began his football career at his nearby home town team Chivas. He progressed through the ranks having successful seasons with the youth teams until he was called up to the senior team in 2001, making his official debut in the Primera División de México on 22 July 2001 in a 1–1 draw against La Piedad in 2001. Salcido disappeared from Chivas' first squad until 2003, when he regained trust as a good defender. He would go on to play five half-seasons registering two goals in 105 matches. Salcido was a 2005 and 2006 Copa Libertadores Semifinalist with Guadalajara and a Runner-Up in Primera División (First Division), losing against UNAM Pumas in penalty shoot-outs in 2004. Salcido made his final league appearance for Guadalajara on 1 April 2006 against Pachuca in a 3-2 win.\n\nIn June and July following the 2006 FIFA World Cup, press speculation linked Salcido to several clubs in Europe, with one report claiming that he had agreed to sign for FA Premier League club Arsenal F.C. However, these speculations proved false as he signed a four-year contract with Dutch champions PSV Eindhoven on 10 July 2006.\n\nSalcido was a first team regular in the Eredivisie under Coach Ronald Koeman, starting 33 of 34 league games in his first season at the club, which saw PSV crowned Dutch champions. On 18 November 2006, he scored his first goal in Europe, a spectacular long-distance goal in a match against Excelsior Rotterdam that ended 4–0. Salcido also appeared in the 2006-07 UEFA Champions League. In total Salcido played 48 Eredivisie and Champions League games that season, finishing 46 of them. For the 2007–08 season, Salcido was awarded the number 3 shirt, previously worn by Michael Reiziger. He was also named the team Vice-Captain after Timmy Simons was promoted to team Captain following the departure of former captain Phillip Cocu. In his second season at PSV Salcido played 33 games in the Dutch League, and 6 games in the Champions League, Salcido was crowned champion for the second straight year with PSV. In his third season with the club he played 28 games in the Dutch League scoring two goals. In 2009–10 Salcido played 27 Eredivisie matches and 9 UEFA Europa League matches. Salcido was a substitute for the beginning of the 2010–11 Eredivisie and the Europa League, where he did not appear in any matches but was soon transferred to Fulham of England.\n\nAfter a good performance with Mexico at the 2010 FIFA World Cup, it was reported that Liverpool wanted to sign Salcido.\n\nOn 26 August 2010 it was announced that Fulham had agreed a £3.6 million deal with PSV to sign the player but the deal was still subject to the player agreeing terms. The deal was then finalised the next day. He made his debut against Blackburn Rovers on 18 September 2010. He contributed an assist in the 56th minute, when his cross pass fell to American player Clint Dempsey, who headed it into the net from 8 yards to level the game at 1–1. He played all 90 minutes. He left the club in August 2011 on loan to club Tigres UANL.\n\nOn 17 August 2011, it was announced that Salcido was transferred to Mexican side Tigres UANL on a season-long loan. After a robbery at his home in Claygate, London, Salcido requested to be transferred back to Mexico due to his family feeling unsettled. In his first season back in Mexico, Salcido helped Tigres win their third league title, and their first title in over thirty years.\n\nOn 7 March 2012, Fulham confirmed that Salcido had joined Tigres on a permanent basis.\n\nOn 20 May 2014, Guadalajara officially announced the signing of Salcido. After his participation at the World Cup, Salcido made his debut for Chivas de Guadalajara in a pre-season friendly match July 9, 2014 at the StubHub Center in Carson, California. Against Cruz Azul, the match ended in a 2–1 win for Guadalajara, with Salcido playing the entire match. Salcido made his first league appearance for Guadalajara July 20, 2014 in a match against Chiapas and played for the entire match. He scored his first goal from a penalty against bitter rivals America, on November 24, 2016.\n\nIn January 2019, he officially joined Veracruz. On 4 February he made his debut against his former club Guadalajara in a 0–0 draw.

He has gone on to appear in several international competitions with Mexico. In 2005, he played in the Confederations Cup in Germany, helping the Mexico national team to a fourth-place finish, where he appeared as a starter in all five matches. During a semi-final match against Argentina, Salcido scored a goal in extra time. He recovered the ball in the Mexican area, dribbled it past three defenders while going the entire length of the pitch, then scored after the shot fooled keeper Germán Lux when it bounced off Fabricio Coloccini.\n\nSalcido was included in the 24-man squad selected on 2 April 2006, by head coach Ricardo Lavolpe, to play for the Mexico national team in the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

{"id": "2163369", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2163369", "title": "Dead or Alive 2", "text": "Dead or Alive 2\n\n\"Dead or Alive 2\" improved upon the graphics engine of its predecessor by using Sega NAOMI hardware and on the gameplay system by including many new features, leading to critical acclaim and strong sales. In 2004, \"DOA2\" was remade for the Xbox as part of \"Dead or Alive Ultimate\".\n\nThe gameplay of \"Dead or Alive 2\", and all subsequent \"DOA\" fighting games, borrows heavily from the \"Virtua Fighter\" series, but makes some key changes that drastically changes the way \"Dead or Alive\" is played in comparison to \"Virtua Fighter\".\n\nIn \"DOA2\", the basis of the entire fighting system is the circular relationship between three types of moves: blows, throws, and holds. The other defining feature of the game, aside from blows/throws/holds, is its stun system. Many attacks can inflict a stun on the opponent; those stunned cannot attack or guard, however they can hold. If the attacker lands a non-knockdown, non-launching attack while the opponent is stunned, the opponent will be re-stunned in a new way, depending on what attack was landed.\n\nA major difference between \"DOA2\" and other fighters was in the safety and non-punishability of attacks, both upon hitting and upon being blocked. Most blows in \"DOA2\" can be punished on hit and block by each character's faster throws, making blow-based offense very risky. In addition to the normal rules of juggling, each character also fits into a specific weight category, which affects how the character responds to being launched and being juggled.\n\nIn \"DOA2\", fights can occur on either water or ice; when a character is on such a surface, all non-knockdown, non-launching attacks will induce a stun on any successful hit. Walls and falls in the middle of stages are everywhere in the game. Many stages are also multi-tiered: to get to other areas of the stage, one character must be knocked off a ledge and fall into the next area. These falls deal usually fairly high damage, but cannot knock the opponent out.\n\nOther notable features included introducing CG cutscenes in line with the plot, replacing the original \"Danger Zone\" areas in stages with fully interactive ones, allowing players to juggle each other into walls, propelling characters from landmarks for more damage (the first game to implement this feature was SNK's \"Samurai Shodown 64\"), and upon completing the game, presenting the player with (sometimes ambiguous) endings for each character using the game's standard engine.\n\n\"Dead or Alive 2\" features a total of 14 playable fighters, plus the unplayable Kasumi X. Two of them are unlockable and cannot be used in story mode or in the arcade version. The ten returning veterans from the first \"DOA\" game are Ayane, Bass Armstrong, Bayman (unlockable), Gen Fu, Jann Lee, Kasumi, Leifang, Ryu Hayabusa, Tina Armstrong, and Zack. The four newcomers are Ein, Helena Douglas, Leon, and Tengu (unlockable boss).\n\n\nFame Douglas, founder and CEO of DOATEC was killed at the end of the 20th century. He was renowned as the sponsor of the legendary Dead or Alive World Combat Championship. After his death, the world began to become chaotic. In the middle of the chaos, it was announced that the second Dead or Alive World Combat Championship will be held.\n\nThe purpose and significance of the tournament changed after Douglas' death. The promoter of the second Dead or Alive Championship, who is fond of conflicts and jealous of the strong, is responsible for Douglas's death. The new promoter, Victor Donovan, is more than a corrupt mastermind, but a man of pure evil. His involvement in the tournament began to bring a sense of terror to the world, resulting in the infamous tengu disaster.\n\nSet less than a year later after the original tournament, a tengu known as Gohyakumine Bankotsubo, or just Tengu, threatens the human world's peace and stability. Kasumi, who won the first tournament was captured by the DOATEC Super-human Development project. Kasumi escapes, but her clone \"Kasumi X\" was created while she was being held captive. Kasumi's brother Hayate, previously injured by Raidou, was also captured and returns from being an unwilling subject of DOATEC's bio-weapon experiment Epsilon left to die in the esoteric Black forest of Germany as \"Ein\" after the experiment was a failure. \n\nRyu Hayabusa (from \"Ninja Gaiden\") enters the tournament vowing to seek and destroy the evil tengu. Though a dangerous, suicidal task for any ordinary man, Hayabusa owes it to himself and to mankind to confront his fate. Hayabusa tries to warn other competitors like Jann Lee about the dangers of the tournament but finds them unwilling to backdown so he proceeds to knock them out of the tournament. He meets Ein, who is actually the missing Hayate suffering from amnesia. During their fight, Hayabusa defeats him and restores some semblance of his memory. Eventually, Hayabusa comes face to face with the evil Tengu. He defeats Tengu, winning the tournament.\n\nThe graphics and gameplay were enhanced and based on a better game engine than the one used in the first game, which allowed the characters and stages to appear less angular and more detailed. A popular and commonly discussed feature, one credited to Tomonobu Itagaki, was the level of graphical detail Tecmo put into the animated breasts of the female characters, as Tecmo went so far as to create a physics engine dedicated entirely to the animation of the female characters' breasts.\n\n\"Dead or Alive 2\" used the song \"Exciter\" by Bomb Factory in its opening sequence. Also used as a background track was \"Deadly Silence Beach\" and \"Clumsy Bird\". Both tracks can be found on the self-titled mini-album \"Bomb Factory\" and on the \"Dead or Alive 2 Soundtrack\".\n\nTwo soundtrack CDs were released in 2000 by Wake Up in Japan: \"Dead or Alive 2 Original Sound Trax\" (KWCD-1001) and \"Dead or Alive 2 Original Sound Trax\" (KWCD-1004). Several Japanese guide books for the game were published by SoftBank (\"Dead or Alive 2 Perfect Guide\", \"Dead or Alive 2 Perfect Guide Dreamcast Ban\", \"Dead or Alive 2 Hard Core Perfect Guide\") and Dengeki (\"Dead or Alive 2 Kōshiki Kōryaku Guide\", \"Dead or Alive 2 Kōshiki Kōryaku & Girls\", \"Dead or Alive 2 Hard Core Kōshiki Kōryaku Guide\").\n\nNine different versions (excluding DOA2 Ultimate on Xbox and the two PSN releases) of \"Dead or Alive 2\" were released: two for the arcade market, and the others were home versions. Tomonobu Itagaki and Team Ninja were constantly enhancing the game for both the Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 as they worked towards their vision of the \"ultimate fighting game\".\n\nThe Dreamcast port was first released in North America on February 29, 2000. It was identical to the arcade Millennium update release, but added the usual Versus and Sparring modes, as well as Team Battle Mode. This version also featured a simplified hold system, which would become standard for the rest of the series. Unlike home ports of the first \"Dead or Alive\" game, there were no unlockables in this release. \"Dead or Alive 2\" was the only game that Tecmo published on the Dreamcast.\n\n\"Dead or Alive 2\" was released on March 30, 2000 as a launch title for the PlayStation 2 in Japan. This version added new stages (Crimson, Koku An and Prairie) and new unlockable costumes. The game engine ran using Field Rendering instead of Frame Rendering, thus it appeared much more aliased than the Dreamcast ports. This version was buggy and prone to lock up in Versus mode.\nItagaki and his team were only given two months initially to produce the first PlayStation 2 port. At the end of this, one of his managers asked to borrow a copy to play, but instead sent in to a production factory. Itagaki was upset by not being able to finish the game on his own terms and fell into a depression during which he briefly considered quitting the industry.\n\nThe European Dreamcast version was released on May 26, 2000. This version included the costumes from the Japanese PlayStation 2 version, but not the new stages. It also added new costumes for Zack and Tina, which pay homage to The Shadow Man and his love interest from the \"Shadow Man\" series. Acclaim developed the \"Shadow Man\" video game and published \"Dead or Alive 2\" in Europe.\n\nThe Japanese Dreamcast version (known as the Limited Edition) was released on September 28, 2000. Cover art featured Kasumi and Ayane, along with a standard cover art version with Kasumi, Ayane and Leifang. The most notable addition was that Bankotsubo and Bayman were now unlockable, playable in all but Story Mode. The new stages from the PlayStation 2 version were not included, in favor of new versions of Burai Zenin and L's Castle stages from the first game. This version also added Sparring mode for Tag Battle, Watch Mode, the User Profile System, online play, more costumes to unlock, and a Gallery Mode with character renders.\n\nOn October 25, 2000, Tecmo released \"DOA2: Hardcore\" for the PlayStation 2 in America and Europe, which was based on the Japanese second update of \"Dead or Alive 2\" for Dreamcast. This version was featuring new playable characters, new stages, extra costumes and introduced the \"Gallery\" option. The Hard*core release was finally the complete game Itagaki had envisioned at the time, featuring many changes compared to its predecessor: Characters, pictures and moves were altered to appear more realistic, lessening the anime-look. Some fighting animations were elaborated upon, while others were cut. New stages were added (8 more than the Dreamcast update). More character outfits were added. Survival Mode now only took place in the \"Danger Zone\" arena. Overall gameplay speed was increased, and the entire game (including cutscenes) now ran at a full 60 frames-per-second (in the Dreamcast version, the game ran at 60fps, while cutscenes ran at 30). A special \"Items Collection\" feature and menu section was added to appeal to video game collectors. New artworks were added, and a CG Gallery section featuring renders of the female characters was added. The player history files were enhanced, and now included statistics on how often the player used each character, and tag battle pairing. Several special moves were added, but left undocumented. English voiceovers were added in addition to the original Japanese voice overs. Kasumi can be unlocked as a trainable 'monster' in \"Monster Rancher 4\" by going to the Shrine, and inserting the \"DOA2: Hardcore\" disk in the PS2.\n\nTecmo followed up on the release of \"Hardcore\" in the US and Europe with the release of \"DOA2: Hard*Core\" in Japan. This last version saw some minor updates, including new cutscenes, a few new costumes, and a new turbo speed option. This was the last \"Dead or Alive\" game to be released for a Sony system as well as the last one to be released for the arcades, as the series became exclusive to the Xbox until the release of \"Dead or Alive Paradise\", \"\", and \"Dead or Alive 5\" respectively.\n\nIn August 2012, a software emulated version of \"DOA2: Hard*Core\" was made available as a downloadable game on the Japanese PlayStation Network. The North American version was released to PlayStation Network in March 2015.\n\nGreg Orlando reviewed the Dreamcast version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it five stars out of five, and stated that \"You'd have to be \"Dead and Buried\" not be enjoy \"Dead or Alive 2\". Gorgeous graphics, excellent gameplay, and some beautiful characters put this square in the running against Namco's \"Soul Calibur\" as the best Dreamcast fighting game.\"\n\nJeff Lundrigan reviewed the PlayStation 2 version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it five stars out of five, and stated that \"This is a tremendous game and a must-have, but if you can choose between the two versions, PS2 enjoys an edge thanks to all the extras – just get used to squinting at the too-bright lights and nasty jaggies.\"\n\nJeff Lundrigan reviewed the PlayStation 2 version of \"DOA 2: Hardcore\" for \"Next Generation\", rating it five stars out of five, and stated that \"This is the best-looking, most full-featured, most packed-with-extras version of one of the best fighting games ever made. Buy it, period.\"\n\n\"Dead or Alive 2\" received critical acclaim and was a commercial success. It brought more than $2 million profit in sales. As of 2016, \"DOA2\" is considered one of the best Fighting games in the genre.\n\nAt release, the Dreamcast version was met with critical acclaim, while the PlayStation 2 version received positive reviews. It was praised for its graphics, cutscenes, and gameplay.\n\n\"GamesRadar+\" included the game on their list of best Dreamcast games, stating that \"\"Dead or Alive's\" first sequel used separate graphics engines for its fighting and cut-scenes, allowing for unprecedented graphical fidelity.\" In 2010, UGO.com ranked it as the ninth top fighting game of all time, \"perhaps most important for introducing Itagaki's famous breast physics engine.\"\n\n\"Dead or Alive Ultimate\" is a remake of \"DOA\" and \"DOA2\" for the Xbox with a greatly improved graphics engine. As it was created after \"Dead or Alive 3\", it takes elements and mechanics from both its original iteration and successor. The action of 3D-axis movement is as free-formatted as \"DOA3\", and Hitomi, as well as Tengu are now playable characters (albeit outside story mode), but other elements have been kept intact from \"DOA2\".

The motifs associated with his depiction on Copán monuments have a distinct resemblance to imagery associated with the height of the Classic-era center of Teotihuacan in the distant northern central Mexican region, and have been interpreted as intending to suggest his origins and association with that prestigious civilization. One of the most commonly cited motifs for this interpretation is the \"goggle-eyed\" headdress with which Yax Kʼukʼ Moʼ is commonly depicted; this is seemingly an allusion to the northern central Mexican rain deity known as Tlaloc by later peoples, such as the Aztecs. However, modern strontium isotope analysis of the human remains recovered from the tomb attributed to him indicate that Kʼinich Yax Kʼukʼ Moʼ spent his formative years much closer to Copán, at Tikal, and had not himself lived at Teotihuacan.\n\nHis remains were found in the Hunal tomb inside of Temple 16, in the Copán acropolis; he was buried with jade and shell jewelry, including his 'goggle-eyed' headress. \n\nHis image occupies the first position in the carving on Altar Q, showing the dynasty's king list. His image is also found in significant positions in other monuments of later rulers.\n\nArchaeological work done at Copán in 2000 excavated the tomb considered to be that of Kʼinich Yax Kʼukʼ Mo under the Acropolis. The skeleton exhibited a number of traumas including healed fractures of the arm, sternum, and shoulder which have been surmised to have resulted from ball court matches. Analysis of strontium in the teeth of the skeleton indicates that the individual spent his early years near Tikal in the Petén Basin region and then at some point between Tikal and Copán, and the isotopic signature did not match with a Teotihuacan origin. Chronologically and epigraphically, however, much evidence points to the general ascension of rulers who were sent into the lowland Maya region either as invaders or envoys from Teotihuacan during the late 4th century; particularly the widely known and powerful Yax Nuun Ayiin I of Tikal, son of Teotihuacan lord Spearthrower Owl. The implication of this, regardless of Kʼinich Yax Kʼukʼ Mo's physical point of geographic origin, is that later Copán rulers, in particular Kʼakʼ Yipyaj Chan Kʼawiil and Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat retrospectively sought to attribute Teotihuacano heritage to the ʼfoundingʼ ruler of their dynasty as a means of legitimising the dynastic claim.\n\nKʼinich Yax Kʼukʼ Moʼ installed Tok Casper upon the throne of Quirigua.\n\n"}

Carroll (born September 17, 1960) is an American evolutionary developmental biologist, author, educator and executive producer. He is the Allan Wilson Professor of Molecular Biology and Genetics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. His studies focus on the evolution of cis-regulatory elements in the regulation of gene expression in the context of biological development, using \"Drosophila\" as a model system. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, of the American Philosophical Society (2007), of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Association for Advancement of Science, as well as a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator.\n\nCarroll was born in Toledo, Ohio. He has stated that, as a kid, he would flip over rocks looking for snakes, and at age 11 or 12, he started keeping snakes. This activity led him to notice the patterns on the snakes and wonder how those form. Carroll got his B.A. in Biology at Washington University in St. Louis, his Ph.D. in immunology from Tufts University and did post-doctoral work at the University of Colorado Boulder.\n\nCarroll is at the forefront of a field known as evolutionary developmental biology (also known as \"evo-devo\"), studying how gene changes control the evolution of body parts and patterns. He is the Allan Wilson Professor of Molecular Biology and Genetics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and an investigator for the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.\n\nIn 1987, Carroll set up a laboratory at the University of Wisconsin-Madison \"focused on understanding how genes get used in different ways to generate the diversity of form that we see\". The Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Biology lists Carroll's interests as \"Genetic control of body pattern in fruit flies, butterflies, and other animals\".\n\nCarroll's team has shown, in a series of papers, how the activation of genes during the embryonic stages of the \"Drosophila\" fruit fly control the development of its wings, and has been searching for the butterfly's counterparts of these genes.\n\nIn 1989, he received the Shaw Scientist Award from the Greater Milwaukee Foundation.\n\nIn 2006, Carroll was interviewed by PBS as part of the NOVA documentary \"The Family That Walks on All Fours\", about a family in Turkey that has members who walk on their hands and feet. In this interview, he discusses the possible genetic underpinnings of this family's condition.\n\nFrom September 2009 to March 2013, he wrote a column for \"The New York Times\" called \"Remarkable Creatures\", where he would discuss findings in animal evolution.\n\nIn 2010, he was named vice-president for science education of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. In 2011, the HHMI launched a documentary film initiative to produce science features for television, to which Carroll was appointed as one of the executive producers. In 2012, one such film, called \"The Day the Mesozoic Died\", retracing the investigation that led to the discovery of the asteroid collision that triggered the mass extinction at the end of that Era, was introduced by Carroll at a National Teacher's Conference.\n\nIn 2010, Carroll received the \"Stephen Jay Gould Prize\" from the Society for the Study of Evolution. In 2012, he was awarded the Benjamin Franklin Medal in Life Science from the Franklin Institute \"for proposing and demonstrating that the diversity and multiplicity of animal life is largely due to the different ways that the same genes are regulated rather than to mutation of the genes themselves.\" \nIn 2016, he was awarded the Lewis Thomas Prize at the Rockefeller University.\n\nCarroll is a proponent of the extended evolutionary synthesis.\n\nSince 2013, Carroll has been listed on the Advisory Council of the National Center for Science Education.\n\n\n\nScience writer Peter Forbes, writing in \"The Guardian\", calls \"Endless Forms Most Beautiful\" an \"essential book\" and its author \"both a distinguished scientist ... and one of our great science writers.\" In Forbes's view, in \"The Serengeti Rules\" Carroll \"manages to unite natural history with the hard science of genomics.\" In her article on \"Science Based Medicine\" titled \"The Essential Role of Regulation In Human Health and In Ecology: The Serengeti Rules\", Harriet Hall says \"This book is a great way to learn about the rules of regulation and about how science works. It’s not just a painless way to learn, it’s positively fun.\" The documentary film, \"The Serengeti Rules\", was released in 2018 and is based on Carroll's book.\n\nLouise S. Mead, reviewing \"The Making of the Fittest\" for the National Center for Science Education, notes that Carroll provides \"some of the overwhelming evidence for evolution provided in DNA\", using different lines of inquiry such as DNA sequences that code for genes no longer in use, and evidence of evolutionary change. Mead notes that evolutionary theory has predictive power, as with icefish whose ancestors had haemoglobin, but no longer needing it in icy water, they have lost it.\n\nDouglas H. Erwin, reviewing \"Endless Forms Most Beautiful\" for \"Artificial Life\", remarks that life forms from \"Drosophila\" to man have far fewer genes than many biologists expected – in man's case, only some 20,000, which is about the same as a fly. He notes the \"astonishing morphological diversity\" of animals coming from \"such a limited number of genes\". He praises Carroll's \"insightful and enthusiastic\" style, writing in a \"witty and engaging\" way, pulling the reader into the complexities of Hox and PAX-6, as well as celebrating the Cambrian explosion of life forms, and much else.\n\n\n \n"}

It is allegedly haunted, although the story explaining why it is haunted is false.\n\nFeargus B. Squire was an executive with the Standard Oil Company and former mayor of Wickliffe, Ohio. Squire's earliest known residence was at 1729 Euclid Avenue in Cleveland. In 1905, Squire moved to 7809 Euclid Avenue. Squire completed work in 1902 on Cobblestone Garth, a Victorian mansion located in Wickliffe, Ohio. The Squires moved from their Euclid Avenue home into Cobblestone Garth in 1910.\n\nAbout 1890, Squire purchased of forest land near what is now Willoughby Hills, Ohio, east of Cleveland. He called it River Farm Estate, and planned to turn it into an English country estate complete with manor house. About 1895, Squire began construction on a gatekeeper's house in the Romanesque Revival style. The structure, which was exceedingly rustic (lacking electricity, natural gas, running water, or sewer) was completed about 1897.\n\nThe outer walls are of locally-quarried Euclid bluestone, a form of bluish-colored sandstone found throughout the greater Cleveland area. The structure originally had a ground floor, two upper floors, and a basement. Its windows were of leaded glass.\n\nSquire abandoned plans for a manor house after encountering difficulty obtaining building materials and labor. Squire and his daughter used the gatekeeper's house as an occasional weekend country home (even spending most of the summer of 1903 there). But Squire's wife disliked the house, and Squire rarely visited it after 1908. He sold the estate and gatekeeper's house to developers in 1922.\n\nAfter the developers went bankrupt, the estate was seized by a local bank. The Cleveland Park Board (precursor to Cleveland Metroparks) purchased most of the land from the bank in 1925. The park board began calling the structure \"Squire's Castle\". Cleveland Metroparks removed the upper floors and filled in the basement.\n\nSquire's Castle was heavily vandalized over the years, with vandals removing the leaded glass windows and stripping the interior of almost all architectural and decorative details. The structure was somewhat restored in 1995.\n\nOn December 26, 1876, Squire married Louisa Christiana Braymaier of Cleveland. She died on October 29, 1927, at Cobblestone Garth in Wickliffe.\n\nA myth about the structure grew up over the years. The details varied, but the essential story was that Louisa Squire woke one night during a storm and went downstairs to investigate. Startled by lightning (which illuminated the stuffed heads of animals in the structure's trophy room), she fell down the stairs and broke her neck. According to this legend, her spectre or a red lantern may be seen floating through Squire's Castle. The myth is false, as Louisa Squire did not die in the building.\n\n"}

The width of Palk Bay ranges from 57 to 107 km and the length is around 150 km. Palk Bay is considered to be one amongst the major sinks for sediments along with Gulf of Mannar . Sediments discharged by rivers and transported by the surf currents as littoral drift settle in this sink. Few scientists have tried to understand the wave characteristics within the Palk Bay. In the southern regions close to Dhanushkodi, wind seas dominate. The northern Eastern region of Palk Bay is exposed to the Bay of Bengal through shallow Palk Strait and hence the swells can enter the PB through this opening.

In the 1990s Banjawarn was owned by the Aum Shinrikyo and following the Tokyo subway attack was the subject of an Australian Federal Police (AFP) investigation. Banjawarn is one of the seventy largest stations in Australia.\n\nIt is situated 350 km (220 miles) north of Kalgoorlie and 800 km (500 miles) north east of Perth, on the edge of the Great Victoria Desert in the community of Leonora. It covers an area of 404,680 hectares (999,986 acres, 1,562 sq mi, 4046.8 km)\n\nThe land is a mix of Wanderrie, mulga, saltbush and grasslands that support both annual and perennial grasses. Gum trees and mulga follow the four main creeks and other watercourses. Several waterholes and lake systems are also found on the property.\n\nThe station was established in 1903 and has had several owners.\n\nIn 1928 Banjawarn was owned by the Warren brothers and was supporting a flock of 1,000 sheep.\n\nIt was owned for a year in 1993 by the Japanese Aum Shinrikyo cult. In 2010 the leasees were Colvin and Adele Day. The property was carrying a herd of about 2,500 head of droughtmaster, shorthorn and Brahman cattle.\n\nAum Shinrikyo was a Japanese doomsday cult responsible for a range of criminal and terrorist acts. In April 1993 they purchased Banjawarn and built a facility there. The Chairwoman for the aboriginal community living near the sheep station, Phyllis Thomas, said that she and other Aborigines saw about five people wearing full-length suits and helmets on the remote site in late August 1993. The suited sect members were standing by a twin engine airplane and others were in the plane.\n\nIn September 1993 a team of Aum scientists arrived in Australia with mislabeled hydrochloric acid among other chemicals.\n\nThe Aum group traveled with chemicals and mining equipment on which they paid over $20,000 in excess baggage fees. According to the Australian Federal Police report, among the baggage was a mechanical ditch digger, picks, petrol generators, gas masks, respirators, and shovels. A customs duty of over $15,000 was paid to import these items. Because of the large amount of excess baggage being brought in by the group, Australian Customs searched the entire group. This search revealed four liters of concentrated hydrochloric acid, including some in containers marked as hand soap. Among the other chemicals that Australian customs officials found were ammonium chloride, sodium sulphate, perchloric acid, and ammonium water. All of the chemicals and some of the laboratory equipment were seized by Australian authorities.\n\nNew chemicals were purchased in Australia, and a research facility of unknown purpose was established at the site. When raided by the Australian government in 1995, it contained computers and laboratory equipment.\n\nThe Australian government, finding that the wells in the region were not operating properly, demanded that a manager be hired to take care of the sheep. The Aum group complied. In early 1994 the research equipment was removed and replaced with sheep farms. The Aum group demanded that they would be the only ones to shear the sheep. 2000 sheep were shorn and sold to a slaughterhouse. \"The manager did not witness any experiments or mineral exploration.\"\n\nThe site was sold in October 1994. On 20 March 1995, the Aum group released toxic sarin gas into part of the Tokyo subway system, killing 12 people and injuring over 1000. In the subsequent investigation, it was revealed that they had purchased the Banjawarn Station, and so the AFP examined the site.\n\nThe site also contained the corpses of a number of sheep that showed signs of exposure to sarin. The soil in the area contained traces of methylphosphonic acid, a residue of sarin use. The conclusion was that Banjawarn had been used as a test site for chemical weapons use.\n\nOn the night of 28 May 1993 a mysterious seismic disturbance was detected in Western Australia and found to have emanated from south of Banjawarn.\n\nThe event sent shock waves through hundreds of miles of desert but was witnessed only by a few long-distance truck drivers and gold prospectors. They reported seeing a fireball in the sky and hearing a protracted low-frequency sound. The cause of the event remained a mystery, however.\n\nAn asteroid impact would have left a large crater, perhaps across, none of which was found. Alternatively, a bolide, or air burst, caused by a stony asteroid of up to some tens of meters in diameter, would not have reached the surface but likely would have exploded in the atmosphere, creating a large shock wave but not an impact crater. This option, the possibility of which was driven home by the widely observed February 2013 Russian meteor event, would have led to measurements and observations that are entirely consistent with data and eyewitness reports, far more so than a seismic disturbance, which would be difficult to reconcile with fireball sightings.\n\nA mine explosion was unlikely, as it was 170 times more powerful than the largest mining explosion known in Australia up to that time. The Urban Geoscience Division of the Australian Geological Survey Organisation determined that the seismic traces of the event \"showed similar characteristics consistent with typical seismic activity for Western Australia,\" and that the event was most likely an earthquake.\n\nFollowing the revelation that Banjawarn was owned by the Aum, there was also speculation in 1997 that this event might have been the result of a test explosion of a nuclear device they had built. The event was determined to have had the strength of \"a small nuclear explosion, perhaps equal to up to 2,000 tons of high explosives\". It was known that Aum were interested in developing nuclear as well as chemical weapons, as they had recruited two nuclear engineers from the former Soviet Union and had been mining uranium at Banjawarn. However, the AFP investigation found no evidence of this or of any equipment that might indicate such research, and the Aum cult members were believed to not be in the country at the time of the event.\n\n\n"}

An old woman named Edith Forbes (Cathleen Nesbitt, in her final screen performance) befriends the girl.\n\nProduced by actress Diane Baker, it was unsuccessful in the UK and received a limited commercial release in the US. It was later broadcast by HBO in the mid-1980s.\n\nThe film's theme song \"Fly Away\" was composed by Jane McNealy and Alice Kuhns.
