The Federal Rules of Evidence contain the rules governing impeachment in US federal courts.\n\nUnder the common law of England, a party could not impeach its own witness unless one of four special circumstances was met. The Voucher Rule required the proponent of the witness to \"vouch\" for the truthfulness of the witness. Here are the special circumstances:\nThe rule has been eliminated in many jurisdictions. Under the US Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 607 permits any party to attack the credibility of any witness.\n\nIn the US, a party has the option of discrediting a witness through impeachment by cross-examining the witness about facts that reflect poorly on the witness's credibility or, in some cases, by introducing extrinsic evidence that reflects negatively on the witness's truthfulness or knowledge.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, the procedure for determining whether a testifying defendant may be impeached is known as a \"Bighum\" hearing.\n\nA party may impeach a witness in the US by introducing evidence of any of the following (remembered via the mnemonic BICCC)\n\nCourts permit parties to cross-examine a witness in order to impeach that witness based on demonstration of bias. Witness bias may be catalyzed by any number of circumstances, ranging from the witness's blood relationship to a party to his financial stake in the outcome of the litigation. Most US jurisdictions require a cross-examiner to lay a foundation before extrinsic evidence can be used to demonstrate bias for impeachment purposes. Although Rule 610 provides that evidence of a witness's \"religious beliefs or opinions is not admissible to attack or support the witness's credibility,\" an inquiry into the witness's religious beliefs or opinions for the purpose of showing interest or bias because of them is not within the rule's prohibition.\n\nIf a witness is accused of bias, and there is an opportunity to cross-examine during the current trial, any statements made at a previous trial/hearing and which are consistent with the testimony at the present trial are admissible, not hearsay.\n\nA party may impeach a witness by introducing those of his prior statements that are inconsistent with his current testimony at trial. In a minority of jurisdictions that follow FRE 801, the prior inconsistent statement may be used not only to impeach but also as substantive evidence.\n\nA prior inconsistent statement is admissible as substantive evidence if \n\nA prior inconsistent statement offered solely for impeachment purposes is admissible regardless of whether it satisfies those requirements.\n\nThe cross-examining attorney need not disclose or show the contents of a prior inconsistent statement to a witness prior to the moment he is questioned. If the witness's attorney asks to see the prior inconsistent statement, however, the questioning attorney must show or disclose its contents.\n\nThe majority of US jurisdictions permit parties to impeach witnesses by demonstrating their \"bad\" character regarding truthfulness. Under the Federal Rules a party may demonstrate that by reputation or opinion testimony. That is, a witness's credibility cannot be bolstered, only impeached.\n\nAdditionally, a party may impeach a witness for \"bad\" character by introducing evidence of the witness's prior conviction of a crime, subject to a series of rules laid out in 609(a). If the witness's prior conviction was for a crime involving dishonesty or false statement, evidence of that crime is admissible for impeachment purposes regardless of whether the crime was a misdemeanor or a felony. If the witness's prior conviction was for a crime not involving dishonesty or false statement, evidence of the conviction is admissible for impeachment only for felonies; misdemeanors are inadmissible.\n\nFurthermore, if the cross-examining party seeks to introduce evidence of a felony not involving dishonesty or false statement, its success in impeaching the witness will depend on whether the witness is the defendant or not. If the witness is defendant, the burden is on the prosecution to show that the probative value of the impeachment (demonstrating the defendant witness's propensity to lie) outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.\n\nThe probative value must merely outweigh unfair prejudice. If the witness is a person other than the defendant, the evidence of the prior felony conviction for a crime not involving dishonesty or false statement is admissible unless the party objecting to the evidence succeeds in the more difficult task of proving that the probative value of the felony conviction is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.\n\nThe probative value must substantially outweigh unfair prejudice. Finally, if a conviction is more than 10 years old, the probative value of admitting the conviction must substantially outweigh the danger of unfair prejudice under FRE 609(b)\n\nA party may impeach a witness for character by cross-examining the witness but not by introducing extrinsic evidence, about specific instances of prior misconduct, often called \"prior bad acts,\" as long as the questions relate to the witness's own character for truthfulness (or untruthfulness) or to the character for untruthfulness of a previous witness that the current witness has testified about before.\n\nUnder California Evidence Code Section 787, a party may not use either cross-examination or extrinsic evidence to impeach a witness by showing specific instances of prior misconduct.\n\nIn civil cases. Proposition 8, the Victims Bill of Rights passed by in 1982, permits parties to use both cross-examination and extrinsic evidence about specific instances of prior misconduct in criminal cases to impeach a witness.\n\nThe witness was unable to sense what he claimed to have (such as he could not see from where he was), or he lacked the requisite mental capacity. Older common law would exclude an incompetent witness from testifying. Modern rules, such as the Federal Rules of Evidence, allow the witness on the stand (in most cases) to consider competence as one of many factors that juries are to consider to determine credibility of the witness.\n\nThe witness is induced to contradict their own testimony during the present proceeding. That differs from inconsistent statements above. Inconsistent statements involve statements made out-of-court (hearsay) or in prior proceedings. Contradiction involves the witness saying two different things in the same testimony.\n\nAnother form of impeachment by contradiction has a subtle effect on the order in which the attorneys present their evidence. When a defense attorney calls a witness who testifies about what happened, or plaintiff's attorney or a prosecutor calls a witness in rebuttal, that gives the opposing attorney the opportunity to present evidence contradicting that witness. Had impeachment by contradiction not been allowed by the rules of evidence, the second attorney would have been barred from presenting the contradicting evidence because the second attorney already had only one chance to prove the facts of the case as claimed. Since his opponent put on a witness, that \"opens the door\" to strengthen the case by going again with more proof of what happened: the only legal excuse for the rehash of the claim is impeaching by contradiction his opponent's witness.\n\nAnother use of impeachment by contradiction can be explained negatively. An attorney cannot contradict an opponent's witness on a trivial (\"collateral\") fact like the color of the hat worn on the day she witnessed the accident, but on more important matters normally excluded by the rules of relevance, contradiction may be allowed. Thus, a witness might not normally be permitted to testify being a safe driver and the opponent cannot normally prove that the driver is unsafe, but if the witness nonetheless happens to testify being a safe driver (no objection was made to the question), the opponent can now contradict by eliciting on cross-examination that the driver was involved in several accidents. Had contradiction impeachment not been permitted, the unsafe character of the witness would have been barred by the rules of evidence.\n\nAnother example is more extreme. Suppose the defendant is on trial for possession of heroin. The defendant's testimony will naturally deny possessing the particular drug. Suppose the defendant foolishly testifies on direct examination, \"In fact, I've never possessed heroin in my life.\" The prosecutor can then, on cross-examination, impeach him with an exhibit of heroin seized on an unrelated occasion even if it was seized in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. The \"Walder\" decision led to a ruling that a defendant can be impeached by his confession even if the confession was obtained in violation of his Miranda rights. \"Harris\", in turn, led to a decision allowing similar impeachment by physical evidence that had been suppressed in the same case as having been seized from defendant in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights.\n\nImpeachment by contradiction evidence is admitted solely to impeach: it cannot be used to prove anything about the events being litigated but only to discredit the witness's credibility. The theory is that when a witness can be contradicted, it should be taken into account in determining the reliability of the witness so the jury is instructed by the judge not to use the impeachment evidence as proof of any facts but only to consider whether the witness in question should be believed.\n\nAll experienced courtroom observers, however, agree that jurors will have great difficulty understanding that distinction, known as \"limited admissibility\" or \"admissibility for a limited purpose\". Even more unlikely is the prospect that a juror who understands the instruction will be psychologically capable of obeying it. The only practical impact of this limited admissibility is that the evidence cannot be used to prop up a weak case that would otherwise be dismissed by the court for insufficient evidence, as it was admitted only for the impeachment of a witness.\n\nThe general rule is that the proponent of a witness may not attempt to build up the witness's credibility prior to being impeached. The rationale is that the witness is presumed trustworthy. It also speeds proceedings by not spending time bolstering when the other side may not even impeach the witness.\n\nTo rehabilitate a witness, the proponent is confined to using the same techniques used by the opponent to impeach the witness. That is, if the opponent impeached via bias, rehabilitation is limited to negating the claim of bias. If the opponent brought in a rebuttal witness who testified to the character of principal witness as that of a liar, rehabilitation is limited to a character witness who testifies principal witness is a truthful person. That is a different consideration from the ever-present right to cross-examine any witness, including character witnesses which in Trump's case include the likes of John Bolton.\n\nIf the opponent shows that the witness made a prior inconsistent statement and implies that after that statement and prior to trial the witness was \"gotten to\" or otherwise developed a motive to lie in court, rehabilitation can be attempted by showing that the witness made a prior consistent statement (consistent with the testimony) before the alleged events that gave rise to the alleged motive to lie. The jury is left with two pretrial statements that are inconsistent with each other, but only one is inconsistent with the testimony, and both were made before the witness was allegedly gotten to. Thus, there might be softening of the accusation that the testimony flows from such as a bribe. Also, there is always a case for allowing a prior consistent statement made at any time before trial to help explain away what is arguably only a seemingly inconsistent statement that is subject to interpretation, such as if it was lifted out of the context that would explain the statement. \n"}

{"id": "2222939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2222939", "title": "Green Lantern Versus Aliens", "text": "Green Lantern Versus Aliens\n\nGreen Lantern versus Aliens is a four-issue comic book intercompany crossover mini-series published jointly by DC Comics and Dark Horse Comics monthly from September 2000 to December 2000. It is written by Ron Marz and illustrated by penciller Rick Leonardi and inker Mike Perkins, with covers by Dwayne Turner.\n\nThe series stars several Green Lanterns, primarily Kyle Rayner, and the titular xenomorphs from the \"Alien\" movie series. Whether the series takes place in the continuity of the DC Comics Universe is unclear, as Brik and Salaak are alive in current Green Lantern continuity, and no mention of Mogo's Xenomorph inhabitants is ever made. However, the series is set sometime after the destruction of the original Green Lantern Corps.\n\nIn 2001, the series was collected into a single volume with a new cover by artist Eric Kohler.\n\nThe story opens in flashback, ten years before the (at the time) current continuity of the \"Green Lantern\" comic books, showing an extraterrestrial Barin Char, the Green Lantern of Sector 1522, dying when a chestburster bursts from his chest. Hal Jordan (who, at the time of the series’ publication, had long been dead) is then summoned by the Guardians of the Universe to rendezvous with fellow Green Lanterns Kilowog, Katma Tui, Tomar-Re, The Green Man and Salaak on the planet Tirama in Sector 1522. The six Green Lanterns are informed of the disappearance of Barin Char and proceed to the border world where he is believed to have disappeared. Tracing the signal from Char's displaced power ring, they enter a cavern inside a mountainous butte where they discover Char's corpse before being attacked by a swarm of Xenomorphs. Jordan decides that rather than exterminate an alien species—particularly since the Xenomorphs appear to be only the interstellar equivalent of sharks, the perfect killing machine without actually being \"evil\"—they would transport the Xenomorphs to the sentient Green Lantern planet Mogo, where they can not harm anyone.\n\nA decade later, the \"Signet Dawn\", a Coluan long-range ore transport vessel, crashes onto the planet. Five extraterrestrials—the Xudarian Tomar-Dar, Brik, Ash, M’Hdahna and the aforementioned Salaak—appear on Earth in the apartment of Kyle Rayner, who at the time, is the Green Lantern of Earth and the only Green Lantern in existence. These five are either former Green Lanterns or were intended to become Green Lanterns at the time of Parallax’s destruction of the Green Lantern Corps, and they inform Rayner of the \"Signet Dawn\"’s crash on Mogo. The six then journey to Mogo to rescue the ship's crew. Inside the hull of the ship, they encounter Crowe, the ship's first officer, who tells Rayner that after the crash, the aliens carried off the other 37 crew members but left her for some reason. Crowe leads Rayner and the others deeper into the ship, where the Xenomorphs attack them, taking Rayner's companions captive, leaving only him, Crowe, and Salaak. When Rayner tries to grab Tomar as he is pulled down a shaft, his power ring slips off his finger and falls down the shaft.\n\nThe trio then climbs down the shaft—Kyle and Salaak subsequently settling any remaining tension between them when Salaak apologizes for judging Kyle by what he was not rather than what he was—and discover five of Crowe's crewmates cocooned by the Xenomorphs, four of whom have been killed by chestbursters. The Xenomorphs then attack the trio, and Crowe and Rayner flee through a passageway, separated from Salaak. They then come across a chamber where they discover a Xenomorph queen with the remainder of Crowe's crew and Rayner's companions cocooned around the walls and Rayner's power ring on the floor. After exchanging a brief kiss for luck, Crowe jumps into the chamber firing at the aliens to distract them while Rayner goes for his ring. During this attempt, the skin on the right half of Crowe's face is ripped away, revealing that she is a gynoid. Rayner reacquires his ring. Crowe, fatally damaged during the melee, tells Rayner that he shouldn't leave the Xenomorphs alive to endanger someone else in the future as Jordan did, so Rayner destroys the Xenomorphs, rescuing the surviving \"Signet Dawn\" crew and his companions. Ash, Brik and Salaak do not survive. Rayner is left with the thought that sometimes the past comes back to haunt you no matter what one does, another reminder of the legacy of Hal Jordan that looms over him.\n\nThe series has been collected into a trade paperback:\n"}

{"id": "2222971", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2222971", "title": "Stewart Park", "text": "Stewart Park\n\nStewart Park is a municipal park operated by the city of Ithaca, New York on the southern end of Cayuga Lake, the largest of New York's Finger Lakes.\n\nThe park offers space and facilities for outdoor recreation such as frisbee, tennis, baseball, softball, and fishing. The park has a carousel that operates throughout the summer. In addition, there is a playground with slides and a fountain, along with sheltered areas for picnics and large gatherings. The park is also equipped with grills dispersed around the grounds for barbecuing. The Cayuga Waterfront Trail runs through the park.\n\nFall Creek empties into Cayuga Lake through Stewart Park. Stewart Park is also the location of the Cascadilla Boat Club's boathouse. The Fuertes Bird Sanctuary sits at the southern end of the park, and it is bordered on the west by the City of Ithaca's municipal golf course.\n\nStewart Park was originally part of Military Lot 88, a tract of land granted to Andrew Moody after the end of the Revolutionary War. Moody sold the land to James Renwick on December 12, 1790. It remained in his family for 104 years as an undeveloped parcel of land.\n\nIn the early 1890s, of Renwick land was purchased by the Cascadilla School to build athletic facilities. At the same time, a trolley line leading to Cayuga Lake was constructed by the Cayuga Lake Electric Railway Company, who also set about developing an amusement park near the lake. The group of properties became known as Renwick Park, and opened to the public in 1894.\n\nUpon opening, the park contained a zoo, a merry-go-round and a renovated dance pavilion for use as Ithaca's first vaudeville theater. However, in 1908, a decrease in the public's use of the railway system led to the dissolution of the Cayuga Lake Electric Railway Company; the company was replaced by the Renwick Park and Traffic Association. Trolley access to the park was completely discontinued in 1915. While this occurred, adjacent to the park were set aside as a bird sanctuary, maintained by the Cayuga Bird Club. Now known as the Fuertes Bird Sanctuary, it was named after a former club president upon his death in 1927.\n\nThe park officially closed in 1915, after which the land was leased to The Whartons film studio during Ithaca's brief heyday as a silent film production center from 1915 to 1919.\n\nIn 1920, Mayor Edwin C. Stewart declared during his inauguration speech that it was a \"travesty\" that Ithaca residents couldn't enjoy the lake without trespassing on private property. In 1921, the City of Ithaca purchased the former Renwick Park land and opened it to the public. Mayor Stewart died before the official opening of the park on July 4, and it was renamed in his honor.\n\nIn 1934, the park's land was raised by several feet to reduce flooding.\n\nAlthough swimming had previously been allowed at the park, since 1964 a prohibition against swimming has been strongly enforced. The ban came about after a boy drowned when turbid, sediment-laden water prevented lifeguards from seeing him. Conditions particular to the lake, including the quantity of sediment at the lake's bottom and the prevailing currents at the lake's southern end, cause such murky and turbid conditions to be common, necessitating the ban on swimming.\n\nA section of the Cayuga Waterfront Trail was completed in 2010, linking the Farmers Market at Steamboat Landing to the Visitors Center. This portion of the trail winds through Stewart Park and the Fuertes Bird Sanctuary.\n\nIn 2011, the Friends of Stewart Park began a wide-ranging rehabilitation and restoration project for Stewart Park. This effort began with the renovation of the Mayor Stewart Memorial Flagpole garden. Since that time, Friends of Stewart Park in partnership with the City of Ithaca, have lead a major revitalizaiton effort including reconstruction of the small Tea Pavilion, restoration of the large Picnic Pavilion, restoration of the swan pond overlook, roof replacements on the Wharton Building and Cascadilla Boathouse, and many smaller improvements throughout the park. Further planned improvements include an accessible playground and splash pad, full exterior restoration on the Cascadilla Boathouse and creation of the Wharton Studio Museum and Park Visitor Center in the Wharton Building that housed the film studio.\n\n\n\n"}

All Scottish armigers are ennobled in their grant or matriculation of arms awarded by the Crown or Sovereign through the Court of the Lord Lyon, and by issuance of a warrant from the Lord Lyon King of Arms are so entered in the Public Register of All Arms and Bearings in Scotland through official \"Ensigns of Nobility\". Without such legal arms it is practically impossible to prove one's nobiliary status. Sir Thomas Innes of Learney, Lord Lyon King of Arm, also states, \"Technically, a grant of arms from the Lord Lyon is a patent of nobility (also referred to a 'Diploma of Nobility'); the Grantee is thereby 'enrolled with all nobles in the noblesse of Scotland.\" In 2018 the Lord Lyon quietly dropped the so called nobility clause from newly issued Letters Patent. \n\nAccording to the 2nd edition of Scots Heraldry at p. 198, Sir Thomas Innes of Learney, Lord Lyon writes:\n\nAs such, a Scottish armiger is recognized under Scottish heraldic law as within the non-peerage rank of Gentleman, which is so recognized under Scots law as a social dignity. Given this court decision, the term \"nobility\" should be avoided, as it has long been confined in Britain to the peerage, or someone of official social rank (Dukes, Marquises, Earls, Viscounts, Barons, etc.). Instead, it is more appropriate to use the term Noblesse in the context of the French definition, which includes the non-peerage rank of Gentlemen. A Gentleman is the lowest rank of gentry, standing below an esquire and above a yeoman. It includes the untitled and minor nobility - the \"noblesse\", to whom rightly belong lairds (those with territorial designations), Esquires and Gentlemen, \"known\" through the grant or matriculation of armorial bearings.\n\nThe dignity of \"Esquire\" (post-nominal Esq.) is an official title in Scotland, unlike other parts of the world. For example, attorneys in the United States use \"Esquire\" as a courtesy title, and it is used by both men and women. In Scotland, the title is exclusively used by men, never women. Scottish armigers who are not peers, feudal barons, or lairds with territorial designations are addressed in correspondence as a post nominal Esq. by the Court of the Lord Lyon.\n\nIf associated with a particular Scottish clan, armigers are the noblesse gentry of their clan, with a duty and responsibility for the management of their clan in our time; and thereby bound to the principles of \"noblesse oblige\".\n"}

It is located in Region E of the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality.\n\nThe original name of Orange Grove was Lemoen Plaas, Afrikaans for Orange Farm, as the description of the area and its original use prior to development and incorporation into the city of Johannesburg.\n\nThe orange trees of what became Orange Grove were planted by J.C.Esterhusen. His daughter was married to another Viljoen whose farmhouse became the original once-famous Orange Grove Hotel, located in the suburb.\n\nOrange Grove is still home to The Radium Beerhall, Johannesburg's oldest surviving bar and grillhouse.\n\nFamous former residents include Mohandas Gandhi, who stayed at 34 Grove Road in his early years of practising law in Johannesburg.\n\nThe streets of the suburb are numerical, with the suffix of \"street\" heading west to east and \"avenue\" south to north. The only exceptions to this are Hope Road and Grove Road, bordering the suburb to the south. \n\nLouis Botha Avenue, initially served as the only single, direct road between the Johannesburg CBD and Pretoria. It was principally the 'High Street' for Orange Grove. Louis Botha was also a direct link to Alexandra Township, where a large part of the work force which found employ in Orange Grove and surrounding suburbs, resided. \nThe surrounding suburbs are (clockwise from the north) Maryvale, Sydenham, Doornfontein 92 IR, Linksfield, Fairwood, Mountain View, Houghton Estate, Fellside, Victoria, Norwood and Orchards. There is a strong sense of community between Orange Grove and its surrounding areas. Most of the residents were blue collar citizens. \n\nThe suburb was informally and fondly known as Little Italy during the 60's, 70's and 80's. This was in part because the majority of residents in Orange Grove were primarily Italians who had immigrated from Italy in search of work during the early 1950s. Portuguese, Jewish and Afrikaans cultures were also present albeit in smaller concentrations. Despite the fact that Orange Grove was colloquially known as 'Little Italy', the mixture of these cultures provided a truly cosmopolitan, European, feel on its main thoroughfare, Louis Botha Avenue, during any day of the week. The Italian Club, an important center for the ethnic community, relocated to Bedfordview in the 1980s, marking the beginning of the decline of \nOrange Grove as an ethnic enclave.\n\nOrange Grove boasts a park which is frequented by residents from surrounding suburbs and in the past most of its residents would utilise Hoy Park Public Pools for recreation, in Sydenham. It is rare for a home to possess a pool in Orange Grove, but many more prominent dwellings in the area do have.\n\nA popular place for children of the area to meet was Patterson Park, in front of the Norwood Police Flats. The area was previously a recreational hub, with pools, tennis courts, athletic lawns, and sporting fields. Today however all that remains is the derelict bowls club house.\n\nPost 1994, the 90's saw a decline in the area as safety and security became a problem. Most of the previously manicured lawns and neat facades which were visible from the streets over low walls were replaced by high walls with electric fences, barbed wire and alarm systems. The Norwood Police Station, services the area. Most of the night clubs, cafes, restaurants and bioscopes (movie theaters) subsequently shut down.\n\nOrange Grove possesses a library and two Primary Schools, Orange Grove Primary School and Linksfield Primary School. Traditionally, residents attended one of the two Primary Schools then moved to Highlands North High School for boys and Waverly Girls' High School for girls respectively. These four schools have serviced Orange Grove for over three generations and have withstood the rigours of political and social upheaval.\n"}

The phrase was coined in 1844 by American poet and author Nathaniel Parker Willis. Soon, the term came to be used to describe the upper circles not only of New York, but also those of other major cities.\n\nIn 1852, Charles Astor Bristed published a collection of sketches on New York Society entitled \"The Upper Ten Thousand\" in \"Fraser Magazine\". In 1854, George Lippard serialized his book \"New York: Its Upper Ten and Lower Million\". The phrase also appeared in British fiction in \"The Adventures of Philip\" (1861–62) by William Thackeray, whose eponymous hero contributed weekly to a fashionable New York journal entitled “The Gazette of the Upper Ten Thousand”. \nThe general acceptance of the term seems to be attested by its use in the title of Edward Abbott's 1864 cookery book, \"The English and Australian Cookery Book: Cookery for the Many as Well as the 'Upper Ten Thousand\"'.\n\nIn 1875, both Adam Bissett Thom and Kelly's Directory published books entitled \"The Upper Ten Thousand\", which listed members of the aristocracy, the gentry, officers in the British Army and Navy, members of Parliament, Colonial administrators, and members of the Church of England. The usage of this term was a response to the broadening of the British ruling class which had been caused by the Industrial Revolution.\n\nMost of the people listed in \"Kelly's Handbook to the Upper Ten Thousand\" were among the 30,000 descendants of Edward III, King of England, tabulated in the Marquis of Ruvigny and Raineval's \"Plantagenet Roll of the Blood Royal\". Most also appeared in Walford's \"County Families\" and Burke's \"Landed Gentry\".\n\n\n"}

The main retail thoroughfare in the area, Rivonia Boulevard, is the location of several shopping complexes as well as many other shops and restaurants. The area known as Rivonia includes the original township of Edenburg, Edenburg Extension 1, and 19 smaller extensions designated 'Rivonia Extension ...', numbered from 0 to 25. There is no designated township (in the legal sense) called Rivonia. The post code for Rivonia is 2128.\n\nRivonia lies between the Braamfontein Spruit and the Sandspruit, and was the location of Liliesleaf Farm (), where in 1963 many of the accused in the Rivonia Treason Trial were arrested. The earliest public transport into Johannesburg was by donkey cart, later by bus. \n\nA Carmelite Convent, accommodating Discalced Carmelite Nuns, sat in the centre of the village until displaced by commercial pressures. (They moved to Benoni.) In a commemorative move, the large shopping centre first built on the site was named The Cloisters. The earlier village lay on the direct path of access along Rivonia Road to the south to the new 'concrete' highway, with a nasty dogleg in the road at 12th Avenue. When it was decided to redesign and improve Rivonia Road through to the highway, the bowling greens and tennis courts of the Rivonia Recreation Club were in the way, and the Club relocated to a handsome new site in Achter Road in Paulshof, leaving only the Rivonia Hall and Library on the original site. Rivonia Produce, a landmark and long established family business, supplying inter alia hay to the many local horse owners, was also forced to move from the dogleg on 12th Avenue to a new building on 11th Avenue. It has since been swallowed into a national hardware chain and disappeared.\n\nHewlett-Packard's main Southern Africa and South Africa office and the registered office of Fujitsu in South Africa are in Rivonia.\nBefore Rivonia was incorporated into the new town of Sandton, along with Bryanston, Sandown and Morningside, it was administered by the Peri-Urban Areas Health Board.\n\n"}

The renovations were completed ahead of schedule with the station reopening on December 29, 2016.

It is the first Children of Bodom album to feature guitarist Roope Latvala (Stone, Sinergy, ex-Waltari), due to the departure of their original rhythm guitarist Alexander Kuoppala. In this album, the band used the drop C tuning, whereas they usually used D standard.

The keyboards also were dropped lower in the mix, with the guitars maintaining musical dominance.\n\n\"Are You Dead Yet?\" is the second Children of Bodom album to have two singles from it. \"Trashed, Lost & Strungout\" was released as an EP and single in 2004, and \"In Your Face\" was released in August 2005 shortly before the album.

He alludes to this during the band's concert DVD, \"Chaos Ridden Years\", and in a magazine article, says: \n\"I came up with the new album title last winter when we were back home and I went out for a night of drinking. I got a hold of some of the cheapest vodka and just drank and drank and drank, and one thing led to another, so we were outside having fun, and I climbed on top of a car, and slipped and fell off, and next thing I know I was in hospital.

He also played district attorney Alec Rybak on \"The Lying Game\" and had a recurring role as Glenn Talbot on \"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\". He has appeared on the American TV drama \"Grand Hotel\" as Felix. \n\nPasdar was born in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.

He graduated from Marple Newtown High School where he played football and studied acting.\n\nHis sister, Anamarie Pasdar, is a theatrical artistic director and producer.\n\nPasdar turned his attention to campus stage productions and rediscovered an early interest in writing and acting. No longer able to play football, he dropped out of school and returned home, taking a job with a theater group, People's Light and Theatre Company. There he worked on sound and lighting as part of the stage crew responsible for set construction. He had a painful accident on the set, cutting off the end of his left thumb. His resulting medical compensation paid for attendance at the Lee Strasberg Theater Institute in New York City.\n\nPasdar was also selected to play a bit part as a police officer in the Dixie Chicks video for their song, \"Goodbye Earl\". The music video won both the Academy of Country Music and the Country Music Association's Video of the Year Awards in 2000.\n\nAt the age of 19, he auditioned for a role in \"Top Gun\". Director Tony Scott was so impressed that he wrote the part of \"Chipper\" just for him. This led to bigger roles in \"Solarbabies\" (1986), \"Streets of Gold\" (1986), and Kathryn Bigelow's cult vampire movie \"Near Dark\" (1987), with Pasdar in the lead role of Caleb Colton. Other major roles include \"Vital Signs\" (1990). Pasdar got his biggest break in movies, when he starred as a beautiful woman opposite Julie Walters in the British movie \"Just Like a Woman\".

The land's name was anglicized at the beginning of World War One and was called Saxonwold. In 1903, Wernher Beit & Co and Max Michaelis gave 200 acres of freehold ground in the Sachsenwald plantation to the Johannesburg Town Council for the use by the people of Johannesburg by the creation of the Herman Eckstein Park. This park would become Zoo Lake, the Johannesburg Zoo and the South African National Museum of Military History. The remaining land in the plantation was developed into a township called Saxonwold in 1925 by the Transvaal Consolidated Land & Exploration Co Ltd. The streets were laid out to view the Rand Regiments Memorial with instructions to home builders not to impede the view of the memorial and the street names having an old Anglo-Saxon theme and ended in wold.\n\nThe Japanese School of Johannesburg previously had a location in Saxonwold. After a negative campaign in 1968, the location was forced to close.\n\nThe Villa d'Este was built in 1923. The South African National Museum of Military History and the Anglo-Boer War Memorial are also located in Saxonwold.\n\n"}

Claude Ryan\n\nTubal Claude Ryan (January 3, 1898 – September 11, 1982) was an Irish-American aviator born in Parsons, Kansas. Ryan was best known for founding several airlines and aviation factories.\n\nRyan began his flying career in 1917 when he enrolled in the American School of Aviation at Venice, California. After making his first solo flight, he was accepted into the Army Air Service with an under-age waiver. The day that he was to report to the recruiting station, the armistice was signed, ending his prospects for a military flying career. Instead, Ryan went to Oregon State College and studied Engineering for less than a year, then was accepted into the Aeronautical Division of the U.S. Army (later known as the United States Army Air Corps). With the Army, Ryan learned to fly at March Field, California, where he graduated in 1921 with a pursuit pilot rating. Ryan flew forestry patrol duty until his enlistment ended in 1922. Ryan then went to San Diego and sold barnstorming rides to pay for a military surplus Curtiss JN-4 Jenny.\n\nRyan's first employee was William Hawley Bowlus, who had been the mechanic at the first flying school Ryan attended. One of his students was a wealthy young stock broker and real-estate developer named Benjamin Franklin Mahoney. Ryan sold half of the Ryan Flying Company to B. F. Mahoney on April 25, 1925. With Mahoney's funding, they bought Donald Douglas's first complete aircraft, the Douglas Cloudster, which Douglas had built to attempt the first non-stop transcontinental flight. A broken engine part grounded that flight in El Paso, Texas and by the time they had made the necessary repairs, a pair of military pilots accomplished the feat in a Fokker.\n\nBowlus modified the Cloudster to carry 10 passengers. With the modified Cloudster and three Standards that Bowlus had modified to carry four passengers each, they founded \"The San Diego - Los Angeles Airlines,\" the first all-year airplane passenger service in the United States. It began operation on March 1, 1925 ferrying passengers on a regular schedule between San Diego, California and Los Angeles, California.\n\nThe company's next venture was to build aircraft to fit the requirements of the new Airmail service. The first aircraft this company, Ryan Airlines, produced was called the Ryan M-1 mail plane developed in 1926. It was the first production monoplane in the country. The so-called Ryan M-1 of the 1920s is in actuality a monoplane designed and engineered by William J. Waterhouse of Glendale, California's Grand Central Airport in 1924 (Waterhouse and Royer Airplane Company). In 1925, Ryan purchased construction blueprints of the Waterhouse/Royer Monoplane \"Cruzair.\" William Hawley Bowlus built the craft in a San Diego waterfront cannery building. Ryan painted his logo on the plane's rudder and immediately marketed it as the Ryan M-1. In an effort to disclaim plagiary, Ryan displayed his copy of the monoplane on an elevated platform at the airfield (Dutch Flat in San Diego), sporting a large banner saying \"Built in San Diego\" (photo on file at San Diego Air and Space Museum, 2001 Pan American Plaza, Balboa Park, San Diego, CA 92101). Compounding and confusing the historical origins of the M-1, Ryan submitted Waterhouse's Cruzair design to the U.S. Patent Office as his own, and in 1929 Ryan was awarded \"inventor\" status for Waterhouse's monoplane design.\n\nRyan sold his half interest in their three companies: the 'Ryan Flying Company'; 'The San Diego - Los Angeles Airlines'; and 'Ryan Airlines' to his business partner, B. F. \"Frank\" Mahoney on November 23, 1926, and was kept on the payroll until the end of that year. Ryan often made claims to have remained to manage it long after that, though this fact is in contention by various sources. What is known is that Ryan was not present when Donald A. Hall was hired and was never present when Charles Lindbergh arrived or during the production of the famous aircraft, this according to personal letters between Charles Lindbergh and the designer Donald A. Hall. Ryan thus was probably not approached by a group of St. Louis, Missouri, businessmen to build an aircraft to cross the Atlantic non-stop (to be flown by Charles A. Lindbergh). It is unclear where the source of the previous reports originated. Ryan had no financial interest in the company and made no financial gain from the NYP project.\n\nRyan used the funds from the sale of Ryan Airlines to buy the US distribution rights to the German Siemens & Halske radial engines, and began that enterprise as soon as the deal was final. He took delivery of his first two engines in December 1926 and mounted the first on the new Ryan M-2 airframe he received from Mahoney as a part of their dissolution agreement. That M-2 with the Siemens & Halske engine became Ryan's sales tool. In late January 1927, he toured the country attempting to sell these engines. Returning to San Diego that summer, he formed the T. C. Ryan Flying School. In October of that year, formed the first Ryan Aeronautical Corporation to sell those engines. Soon after, he became embroiled in a lawsuit with the Mahoney-Ryan Aircraft Corporation, now based in Anglum, Missouri over his use of the \"Ryan\" name (the dissolution agreement with Mahoney forbade him from doing so without the letters \"T. C.\" attached to the front. That lawsuit coupled with his failure to make good on his agreement to begin manufacturing the Siemens & Halske engines stateside (which he renamed 'Ryan-Seimens') caused his relationship with the engine manufacturer to sour. The German-based Siemens & Halske company bought him out in 1928. Ryan then took a hiatus.\n\nLittle is known of Ryan's dealings during that hiatus. It has been inferred that Ryan was instrumental in getting newly-formed land created when dredged material was deposited between the factory where the Spirit of St. Louis was built and Dutch Flats, the airfield it flew from. This resulted from San Diego city fathers enacting a bond measure to deepen San Diego Harbor so that merchant ships and the Navy's newest aircraft carriers could safely navigate the harbor.\n\nIn 1931, Ryan opened a flying school in San Diego, which he named the 'Ryan School of Aeronautics'. This company was one of many around the country (including, among others, the Parks College with campuses in Tulsa, OK, and St. Louis, MO) that served the government's need for trained pilots through the Civilian Pilot Training Program as they were increasing their readiness for what would become World War II.\n\nDissatisfied with the trainer aircraft available at the time, Ryan decided to produce his own, and returned to manufacturing. Thus, in 1932, he formed the 'new' Ryan Aeronautical Corporation, the second incarnation of the Ryan Aeronautical Company, which became known as \"Ryan Aircraft\". It was the fourth new company to bear his name, and the last one he would form. The plane it was to manufacture took two years to complete, and in 1934 the Ryan ST flew for the first time. The ST was a very successful design, and many believe it to be one of the most beautiful aircraft ever built. Over the years, it was developed into a series of aircraft that were widely used by civilian organizations and military worldwide.\n\nRyan Aeronautical Corporation is also famous for producing the Q-2 Firebee and related aircraft, some of the most famous and common UAVs in the 20th century, with extensive use in the Vietnam War.\n\nRyan Aeronautical Corporation produced many aircraft over the years, most of them trainers. Ryan again sold out his entire interest in a company he had founded, when in 1969, he sold Ryan Aeronautical Corp. to the Teledyne Corporation. That company, renamed Teledyne-Ryan, has always claimed to be the successor of the company that built the Spirit of St. Louis, but they had no connection to the Ryan Airlines other than the fact that Ryan founded them both. They produced a series of pilotless drones and airframes for the Apache helicopter. Teledyne later sold that latter company to Northrop Grumman.\n\nAfter his retirement Ryan formed a new company with his son Jerome to develop and market the Ryan ST-100 Cloudster, a motor glider the elder Ryan had designed. The aircraft was type certified as both a light aircraft and powered glider, but Ryan died before production was commenced and only one was completed.\n\nRyan died September 11, 1982, in San Diego, California. He was interred at the Cypress View Mausoleum and Crematory. He was survived by his wife, Zeta Gladys Bowen Ryan (1899–1997).\n\n\n\n\n"}

Having seen pictures of O.

In the book \"Overkill: The Untold Story of Motorhead,\" biographer Joel McIver quotes Taylor saying:\nIt is more likely that Clarke left because of mounting tension with Kilmister, who had been unhappy with Clarke's production on the \"Iron Fist\" album and fed up with Clarke's continued threats to leave. In an interview with Scott Adams that appears on Clarke's official website, the guitarist insists: \nIt was released to little fan fare and all but the most dedicated fans even own a copy, to judge by the sales Lemmy has stated over the years. It was reissued in various countries in the eighties; but since then it is only available on the Bronze Records compilation album \"No Remorse\", of 1984, remastered reissue by Sanctuary Records in 2005, as part of the deluxe edition remastered series they did.\n\nReviewers have commented that although Lemmy has always said that the late Wendy O.

{"id": "2223114", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2223114", "title": "Baryon asymmetry", "text": "Baryon asymmetry\n\nIn physical cosmology, the baryon asymmetry problem, also known as the matter asymmetry problem or the matter-antimatter asymmetry problem, is the observed imbalance in baryonic matter (the type of matter experienced in everyday life) and antibaryonic matter in the observable universe. Neither the standard model of particle physics, nor the theory of general relativity provides a known explanation for why this should be so, and it is a natural assumption that the universe is neutral with all conserved charges. The Big Bang should have produced equal amounts of matter and antimatter. Since this does not seem to have been the case, it is likely some physical laws must have acted differently or did not exist for matter and antimatter.\nSeveral competing hypotheses exist to explain the imbalance of matter and antimatter that resulted in baryogenesis. However, there is as of yet no consensus theory to explain the phenomenon. As remarked in a 2012 research paper, \"The origin of matter remains one of the great mysteries in physics.\"\n\nIn 1967, Andrei Sakharov proposed a set of three necessary conditions that a baryon-generating interaction must satisfy to produce matter and antimatter at different rates. These conditions were inspired by the recent discoveries of the cosmic background radiation and CP violation in the neutral kaon system. The three necessary \"Sakharov conditions\" are:\n\nBaryon number violation is obviously a necessary condition to produce an excess of baryons over anti-baryons. But C-symmetry violation is also needed so that the interactions which produce more baryons than anti-baryons will not be counterbalanced by interactions which produce more anti-baryons than baryons. CP-symmetry violation is similarly required because otherwise equal numbers of left-handed baryons and right-handed anti-baryons would be produced, as well as equal numbers of left-handed anti-baryons and right-handed baryons. Finally, the interactions must be out of thermal equilibrium, since otherwise CPT symmetry would assure compensation between processes increasing and decreasing the baryon number.\n\nCurrently, there is no experimental evidence of particle interactions where the conservation of baryon number is broken perturbatively: this would appear to suggest that all observed particle reactions have equal baryon number before and after. Mathematically, the commutator of the baryon number quantum operator with the (perturbative) Standard Model hamiltonian is zero: formula_2. However, the Standard Model is known to violate the conservation of baryon number only non-perturbatively: a global U(1) anomaly. To account for baryon violation in baryogenesis, such events (including proton decay) can occur in Grand Unification Theories (GUTs) and supersymmetric (SUSY) models via hypothetical massive bosons such as the X boson.\n\nThe second condition for generating baryon asymmetry—violation of charge-parity symmetry—is that a process is able to happen at a different rate to its antimatter counterpart. In the Standard Model, CP violation appears as a complex phase in the quark mixing matrix of the weak interaction. There may also be a non-zero CP-violating phase in the neutrino mixing matrix, but this is currently unmeasured. CP violation was first observed in the 1964 Fitch-Cronin experiment with neutral kaons, which resulted in the 1980 Nobel Prize in physics (direct CP violation, that is violation of CP symmetry in a decay process, was discovered later, in 1999). Due to CPT symmetry, violation of CP symmetry demands violation of time inversion symmetry, or T-symmetry. Despite the allowance for CP violation in the Standard Model, it is insufficient to account for the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe given the limits on baryon number violation, meaning that beyond-Standard Model sources are needed.\n\nA possible new source of CP violation was found at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) by the LHCb collaboration during the first three years of LHC operations (beginning March 2010). The experiment analyzed the decays of two particles, the bottom Lambda (Λ) and its antiparticle, and compared the distributions of decay products. The data showed an asymmetry of up to 20% of CP-violation sensitive quantities, implying a breaking of CP-symmetry. This analysis will need to be confirmed by more data from subsequent runs of the LHC.\n\nIn the out-of-equilibrium decay scenario, the last condition states that the rate of a reaction which generates baryon-asymmetry must be less than the rate of expansion of the universe. In this situation the particles and their corresponding antiparticles do not achieve thermal equilibrium due to rapid expansion decreasing the occurrence of pair-annihilation.\n\nAnother possible explanation of the apparent baryon asymmetry is that matter and antimatter are essentially separated into different, widely distant regions of the universe. The formation of antimatter galaxies was originally thought to explain the baryon asymmetry, as from a distance, antimatter atoms are indistinguishable from matter atoms; both produce light (photons) in the same way. Along the boundary between matter and antimatter regions, however, annihilation (and the subsequent production of gamma radiation) would be detectable, depending on its distance and the density of matter and antimatter. Such boundaries, if they exist, would likely lie in deep intergalactic space. The density of matter in intergalactic space is reasonably well established at about one atom per cubic meter. Assuming this is a typical density near a boundary, the gamma ray luminosity of the boundary interaction zone can be calculated. No such zones have been detected, but 30 years of research have placed bounds on how far they might be. On the basis of such analyses, it is now deemed unlikely that any region within the observable universe is dominated by antimatter.\n\nOne attempt to explain the lack of observable interfaces between matter and antimatter dominated regions is that they are separated by a Leidenfrost layer of very hot matter created by the energy released from annihilation. This is similar to the manner in which water may be separated from a hot plate by a layer of evaporated vapor, delaying the evaporation of more water.\n\nThe presence of an electric dipole moment (EDM) in any fundamental particle would violate both parity (P) and time (T) symmetries. As such, an EDM would allow matter and antimatter to decay at different rates leading to a possible matter-antimatter asymmetry as observed today. Many experiments are currently being conducted to measure the EDM of various physical particles. All measurements are currently consistent with no dipole moment. However, the results do place rigorous constraints on the amount of symmetry violation that a physical model can permit. The most recent EDM limit, published in 2014, was that of the ACME Collaboration, which measured the EDM of the electron using a pulsed beam of thorium monoxide (ThO) molecules.\n\nThe state of universe, as it is, does not violate the CPT symmetry, because the Big Bang could be considered as a double sided event, both classically and quantum mechanically, consisting of a universe-antiuniverse pair. Meaning that this universe is the charge (C), parity (P) and time (T) image of the anti-universe. This pair emerged from the big bang epochs not directly into a hot, radiation-dominated era. The antiuniverse would flow back in time from the Big Bang, becoming bigger as it does so, it would be also dominated by antimatter. Its spatial properties are inverted if compared to those in our universe, this situation could be analogous to creating electron-positron pairs in a vacuum. This model, devised by physicists from the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Canada, proposes that temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) are due to the quantum-mechanical nature of space-time near the Big Bang singularity.\n\nThis model has not shown if it can reproduce certain observations regarding the inflation scenario, such as explaining the uniformity of the cosmos on large scales. However, it provides a natural and straightforward explanation for dark matter. Such universe-antiuniverse pair would produce large numbers of superheavy neutrinos, also known as sterile neutrinos. These neutrinos might also be the source of recently observed bursts of high-energy cosmic rays.\n\nThe challenges to the physics theories are then to explain \"how\" to produce the predominance of matter over antimatter, and also the \"magnitude\" of this asymmetry. An important quantifier is the \"asymmetry parameter\",\nThis quantity relates the overall number density difference between baryons and antibaryons (\"n\" and \"n\", respectively) and the number density of cosmic background radiation photons \"n\".\n\nAccording to the Big Bang model, matter decoupled from the cosmic background radiation (CBR) at a temperature of roughly kelvin, corresponding to an average kinetic energy of / () = . After the decoupling, the \"total\" number of CBR photons remains constant. Therefore, due to space-time expansion, the photon density decreases. The photon density at equilibrium temperature \"T\" per cubic centimeter, is given by\nwith \"k\" as the Boltzmann constant, \"ħ\" as the Planck constant divided by 2 and \"c\" as the speed of light in vacuum, and \"ζ\"(3) as Apéry's constant. At the current CBR photon temperature of , this corresponds to a photon density n of around 411 CBR photons per cubic centimeter.\n\nTherefore, the asymmetry parameter \"η\", as defined above, is \"not\" the \"good\" parameter. Instead, the preferred asymmetry parameter uses the entropy density \"s\",\nbecause the entropy density of the universe remained reasonably constant throughout most of its evolution. The entropy density is\nwith \"p\" and \"ρ\" as the pressure and density from the energy density tensor \"T\", and \"g\" as the effective number of degrees of freedom for \"massless\" particles (inasmuch as \"mc\" ≪ \"k\"\"T\" holds) at temperature \"T\",\nfor bosons and fermions with \"g\" and \"g\" degrees of freedom at temperatures \"T\" and \"T\" respectively. Presently, \"s\" = .\n\n"}

Starr was the third member of the group to issue a solo recording (after George Harrison and John Lennon), and \"Sentimental Journey\" is notable for being the first studio album of what might be termed \"conventional\" music by a member of the band, compared to the experimental, soundtrack or live releases of his two bandmates. Paul McCartney's debut, \"McCartney\", would follow three weeks after \"Sentimental Journey\"'s release. Recording of the album was completed in early March 1970, with \"Sentimental Journey\" being rushed out a few weeks later to avoid clashing in the shops with the Beatles' impending final album \"Let It Be\" in May.\n\nThe idea for a solo album first came from the rest of the Beatles, who said that Starr should do a solo record, despite his minimal songwriting abilities, and later from his mother Elsie Starkey and step-dad Harry during one day at their Liverpool home. His mother said that Starr had good vocals. The plan was to create an album of standards that would reflect his mother's favourite songs, even asking them and other members of his family to choose the tracks. Starr engaged the services of Beatles producer George Martin to helm his solo debut, shortly after the Beatles' \"Abbey Road\" (1969) came out.\n\nStarr had one song each arranged by different musicians, ranging from fellow-Beatle Paul McCartney, and Martin himself to Richard Perry, Quincy Jones, The Bee Gees' Maurice Gibb, Klaus Voormann, and Elmer Bernstein among others, as Starr thought the album would have a flavour to it. Author Bill Harry states that on 1 October 1969, Starr asked Count Basie to write an arrangement score for \"Night and Day\"; the finished score arrived to Starr on 6 October. However, Chico O'Farrill received credit for the arrangement.\n\nSessions for the album began on 27 October, on which Starr, backed by an orchestra, recorded the track \"Night and Day\" at Abbey Road Studios. The track was also mixed the same day. The next session didn't take place until over a week later, on 6 November at Wessex Sound Studios, recording a track that currently remains unreleased, \"Stormy Weather\". The following day, the backing track for the McCartney-arranged \"Stardust\" was recorded, which nearly earned the album the title of \"Ringo Stardust\". On 14 November, Starr added his vocal to that track, and started developing the track \"Dream\"; arranged by Martin, the song was finished on 18 November at Trident Studios. The backing track for \"Blue, Turning Grey Over You\" was recorded 10 days later on 28 November, and then completed on 4 December, the vocals for the track weren't recorded until later in the new year.\n\nShortly after recording \"Blue, Turning Grey Over You\" Starr went on a trip to the US, and went on to record lead for the Jones-arranged \"Love Is a Many Splendored Thing\" on 26 December, at A&M Studios. The first session in the new year, 1970, for the album was held on 14 January, at Olympic Sound Studios. There, vocals for \"Love Is a Many Splendored Thing\" and \"Sentimental Journey\" were laid down, the latter was arranged by Perry. The next session took place nearly a month later on 3 February 1970, at Abbey Road Studios, where the backing track for \"Love Is a Many Splendored Thing\" was remade, featuring an orchestra, and Starr laying down a new vocal track for the song. Starr re-recorded his vocals for the song on the 5th. Starr recorded vocal overdubs on \"Have I Told You Lately That I Love You?\" on both 9 and 18 February 1970, the track was arranged by Elmer Bernstein. On 11 February, the orchestra for \"I'm a Fool to Care\" was conducted by Voorman, who also arranged his version of the song at Starr's request. On the same day, Starr added his vocal track to the song. A day later, the backing track, and Starr's vocal, for \"Let the Rest of the World Go By\" were recorded; the track was arranged by Les Reed. Nearly a week later, on 18 February, overdubs were added to the song.\n\nThat same day, the vocals for both \"Have I Told You Lately That I Love You?\" and \"Let the Rest of the World Go By\" were re-recorded. Following this, \"It Don't Come Easy\" was recorded during a late-night part of the session, under the title \"Gotta Pay Your Dues\". Two days later, \"I'm a Fool to Care\", \"Let the Rest of the World Go By\" and \"Sentimental Journey\" were mixed. On 24 February, over a week later, Starr's vocal was recorded for \"Blue, Turning Grey Over You\". Now moving to De Lane Lea Studios a day later, the Johnny Dankworth-conducted orchestra had made the backing track for \"You Always Hurt the One You Love\", on to which, Starr added his vocal track the same day. Some time in February, the unreleased tracks \"Autumn Leaves\" and \"I'll Be Looking at the Moon\" were recorded; eventually finding their way onto bootleg albums. Moving again, this time to Morgan Sound Studios on 5 March, at McCartney's suggestion, the orchestra-laden \"Whispering Grass (Don't Tell the Trees)\" and \"Bye Bye Blackbird\" (the latter arranged by Maurice Gibb) were taped. On 6 March, work was done on \"You Always Hurt the One You Love\" by Dankworth adding drums, piano and saxophone; this and four other tracks were mixed on the day. The following day, further overdubs were added to \"I'm a Fool to Care\".\n\n\"Sentimental Journey\" was released in the UK on 27 March 1970, and in the US on 24 April 1970. It received fair reviews upon its release, although many critics found the idea of Starr covering standards a bit odd considering his musical background. His fame in the Beatles was all that was required, however, to get it all the way to number 7 in the UK – with no single release to promote it – and number 22 in the US. The album sold 500,000 copies in the US within the first two weeks of release.\n\nAmong his fellow Beatles, in an interview with BBC Radio's Johnny Moran, George Harrison described \"Sentimental Journey\" as \"a great album\" and \"really nice\". Conversely, John Lennon told \"Rolling Stone\" editor Jann Wenner in December 1970 that he was \"embarrassed\" by Starr's debut. Starr later said of \"Sentimental Journey\": \"The great thing was that it got my solo career moving – not very fast, but just moving. It was like the first shovel of coal in the furnace that makes the train inch forward.\"\n\nThe album cover consisted of a photograph by Richard Polak, showing a pub, The Empress in Dingle, Liverpool, located close to Starr's place of birth. The superimposed figures in the windows of the pub are Starr's relatives. To promote the album, Starr appeared in a promotional film, which was directed by Neil Aspinall, of the album's title track. The clip aired on the TV show \"Talk of the Town\" on 15 March, and on \"Frost on Saturday\", hosted by David Frost, two weeks later. In the US, it appeared on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\".\n\nA budget edition was released in February 1981 by Capitol. \"Sentimental Journey\" was remastered and reissued on CD in 1995, on 1 May in the UK, and on 15 August in the US. The music video for the title track appeared on the CD/DVD version of \"\".\n\nIn his review for \"Rolling Stone\", Greil Marcus called \"Sentimental Journey\" \"horrendous\" but \"classy\". John Gabree of \"High Fidelity\" considered that the impressive cast of musical arrangers were merely \"compensating for the fact that Ringo can't sing\" and dismissed most of the material as \"some of the tiredest junk ever written\".\n\nMusic critic Robert Christgau said it was \"For over-fifties and Ringomaniacs\". In \"\", authors Roy Carr and Tony Tyler called the album \"a gawky, badly sung, overly sentimental selection of moribund mambos. All are dispensable.\"\n\nMore recently, Richie Unterberger of AllMusic has written of the album: \"Savaged by some critics, it's really not all that bad. But it ain't rock & roll, it's not what Ringo does best, and it's not an essential part of anyone's collection, Beatles fan or otherwise\".\n\nNPR music critic Tim Riley also reacted more favourably: \"Backed by full jazz band and occasional strings, Ringo poses as a Liverpudlian Jack Jones, with surprisingly good results.\" Riley added that that album had \"a deceptively easy feel, and the strongest moments ... ('Dream' and 'Blue Turning Grey Over You' ...) confirm his fundamental appeal as a personality.\"\n\n\nFootnotes\nCitations\n"}
{"id": "2223152", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2223152", "title": "Beaucoups of Blues", "text": "Beaucoups of Blues\n\nBeaucoups of Blues is the second studio album by the English rock musician and former Beatle Ringo Starr. It was released in September 1970, five months after his debut solo album, \"Sentimental Journey\". \"Beaucoups of Blues\" is very far removed in style from its pop-based predecessor, relying on country and western influences. A longtime fan of the genre, Starr recorded the album over three days in Nashville with producer Pete Drake. \"Beaucoups of Blues\" failed to chart in Britain but achieved moderate commercial success in the United States, where it reached number 35 on \"Billboard\"s Country Albums list and number 65 on the \"Billboard\" Top LPs chart.\n\nDuring Ringo Starr's tenure with the Beatles he had dabbled with country music: the band covered the country song \"Act Naturally\", and Starr co-wrote the country-influenced track \"What Goes On\" and wrote the country song \"Don't Pass Me By\". While playing on sessions for George Harrison's \"All Things Must Pass\", Starr – a long-time country and western fan – met American guitarist Pete Drake, in May 1970. Starr had to pick up Drake from the airport so that the pair could record with Harrison; Drake noticed the number of country albums Starr had in his vehicle. Realising Drake's deep connection to country, Starr asked him if they could collaborate on an album together. Drake told Starr his musician friends could compose more than an album's worth of material in a week, which Starr thought was \"impossible\". Starr was very keen and agreed. Starr promptly flew to Nashville on 22 June.\n\nStarr's original idea was to have the sessions take place in England and send the master tapes of the finished tracks to Drake. However, Drake convinced him to have the sessions take place in Nashville instead. All of the tracks were cut in three days, on 25, 26 and 27 June, at Music City Recorders. Sessions were engineered by Scotty Moore. All the material for the album was written purposely for Starr. Guitarist Charlie Daniels recalled the sessions as \"pretty typical Nashville sessions. You know, three songs in three hours. It was go in, sit down and work. Here's the songs, here's the chords, let's get it done. It was not a Beatles-type leisurely session. It was work.\"\n\nStarr sang a duet with Jeannie Kendall on the track \"I Wouldn't Have You Any Other Way\". Also recorded during the sessions was the B-side to the title track, \"Coochy Coochy\", which originally ran to 28 minutes in length. The sessions went exceedingly well, according to Starr, who has said that they recorded \"a few other tracks that we didn't put out\" and ended the sessions with two long jam sessions, one lasting 18 minutes and the other 20 minutes. Session drummer D. J. Fontana recalled that Starr \"never varied from that tempo. He had the greatest conception of tempo I've ever heard in my life. I have never heard anybody play that steady in my life, and that's a long time.\" Acetate discs of the album, which were titled \"Ringo in Nashville\", were sold at an auction in August 1992, featured a different track order and included songs not featured on the released version of the album. It was clear to all that Starr's vocals were much more suited to the genre of country than the old standards that characterised \"Sentimental Journey\". For Starr, making \"Beaucoups of Blues\" had fulfilled a lifelong ambition.\n\n\"Beaucoups of Blues\" was released on 25 September 1970 in the UK and on 28 September in the US. The title track was released as a single only in the US, backed with the non-album track \"Coochy Coochy\" on 5 October 1970. As with \"Sentimental Journey\", the fan base was bemused by Starr's abrupt change in style. \"Beaucoups of Blues\" did not perform nearly as well as its predecessor, missing the UK charts and reaching only number 65 in the US. The album fared better in other countries, peaking at number 34 in Canada, number 33 in Australia, and number 21 in Norway.\n\nThe front cover of \"Beaucoups of Blues\", according to Sorrells Pickard, was taken outside musician Tracy Nelson's (Mother Earth – The Blues Broads) smokehouse in Nashville by Marshall Fallwell, Jr. The back cover featured a photo of a large majority of the musicians that appeared on the album. In light of the tepid commercial reaction, Starr would refrain from further album releases for the time being, preferring to concentrate on his second vocation, film acting. On 18 October, Apple announced that a second album of the Nashville recordings would be released; however, the album never materialised. \"Beaucoups of Blues\" was remastered and reissued on CD in 1995, on 1 May in the UK, and on 1 August in the US. This edition came with two bonus tracks: \"Coochy Coochy\" and a jam with all the musicians titled \"Nashville Jam\".\n\nWriting for \"Rolling Stone\", Charles Burton remarked: \"If \"Beaucoups of Blues\" reminds one of any record, it's \"Nashville Skyline\", only instead of being lovable, spaced-out Bobby Dylan in front of those luxurious Nashville backups, it's lovable Richard Starkey who is crooning his heart out.\" In an interview with Jann Wenner of \"Rolling Stone\" on 8 December 1970, John Lennon called the album \"a good record\", but qualified that comment by saying he \"didn't feel as embarrassed as I did about [Starr's] first record\".\n\nIn \"Melody Maker\", Richard Williams remarked on Starr's limitations as a vocalist but found that his \"conviction and charm\" were such that \"Beaucoups of Blues\" \"forces one to abdicate from any hip posture and admit, just this once, to sheer uncomplicated enjoyment\". Williams acknowledged the key roles played by Drake and guitarist Chuck Howard, before concluding: \"One can imagine … that Ringo had a ball making this album. I had a ball listening to it.\" In his combined review of all the former Beatles' 1970 solo releases, Geoffrey Cannon of \"The Guardian\" rated \"Beaucoups of Blues\" as his favourite, saying: \"The result is superb. Not because Ringo is a good singer, but because, this time, he's let himself be used well. People who work with men like Pete Drake and Charlie McCoy don't go wrong.\" Writing in \"Saturday Review\" magazine, Ellen Sander described the LP as \"so protective and perfect a presentation of a vastly underestimated singing talent\" and paired it with Harrison's \"All Things Must Pass\" as solo albums that \"delight in their individuality while recognizing, but not relying on, a former mode of expression\". \"Village Voice\" critic Robert Christgau believed Starr was trying to impersonate Buck Owens while singing flat, if not entirely faint, but concluded that \"both the songs and Pete Drake's production bespeak a high-quality obsession — the music sticks. And Ringo is still Ringo, which means he's good at making himself felt.\"\n\nAlthough it was only moderately successful at the time, some critics have since stated that \"Beaucoups of Blues\" is one of Starr's best albums. Bob Woffinden wrote in his 1981 book \"The Beatles Apart\": \"Ringo took his chance well and his homely lugubrious voice suited those typically maudlin country songs like a charm. It's one of the best Beatle solo albums.\" Among reviews of the 1995 reissue, \"Q\" magazine described it as \"always likable and original\" and \"a collection of contemporary country songs, delivered by Ringo Starr in a languidly melancholic style curiously reminiscent of Michael Nesmith\". \"Mojo\" editor Paul Du Noyer admired the \"stellar cast of country players\" on the recordings and added that \"the groove is loose and fluent.\"\n\n\n"}

The wording of the Scout Promise (or Oath) and Scout Law have varied slightly over time and from country to country. Some national organization promises are given below. Although most Scouting and Guiding organizations use the word \"promise\", a few such as the Boy Scouts of America tend to use \"oath\" instead. Typically, Scouts and Guides will make the three-fingered Scout Sign when reciting the promise.\n\nIn his original book on Boy Scouting, Baden-Powell introduced the Scout Promise, as follows:\n\nThe form of the promise has varied slightly from country to country and over time, but must fulfill the requirements of the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM) to qualify a National Scout Organization for membership. Together with clarifying its Scout Law, the Constitution of WOSM states:\n\nIn order to accommodate many different religions within Scouting, \"God\" may refer to a higher power, and is not specifically restricted to the God of the monotheistic religions. The WOSM Constitution explains \"Duty to God\" as \"Adherence to spiritual principles, loyalty to the religion that expresses them and acceptance of the duties resulting therefrom.\"\n\nThe World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS), which is a sister organization to WOSM, has the very same wording in their constitution (Part I, Article 2: Original Promise), and follows similar policies.\n\nAlthough the Constitution of WOSM states that the Promise should include a reference to Duty to \"God\", Scouting founder Lord Baden-Powell approved the use of promises with reference to a \"higher ideal\", \"higher truth\", an optional reference to God, or without a reference to God, for Belgium, Czechoslovakia, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Finland. Three of these countries still offer this alternative promise (France, the Netherlands and Czech Republic). WOSM stated in 1932 that no new exceptions would be made and expressed the hope that the few remaining countries would stop using a promise without any reference to Duty to God.\n\nThe Israeli Scouts, though founded in 1919/1920, and joining WOSM in 1951 and WAGGGS in 1963, also have no \"duty to God\" or apparent equivalent in their promise.\nIn 1969, the Eclaireuses et Eclaireurs israélites de France decided to discontinue using the reference to \"God\" due to its inconsistency with religious beliefs and practices from a Jewish perspective. Use of the word God (Dieu), derived from Zeus, can be seen as an inappropriate pagan reference in Jewish texts or education.\n\nAs of July 2017, Scouts Australia provides the option to use one of two different versions of the Scout Promise, one which allows scouts to promise \"To be true to my spiritual beliefs [,] To contribute to my community and our world.\" The other option is to promise \"To do my duty to my God, and To the Queen of Australia.\" \n\nScout sections that follow traditional Scouting, such as Baden-Powell Scouts within the World Federation of Independent Scouts, use several promises including the original Scout promise above that includes the reference to God. Some, however, for example the 1st Tarrant Scout Group in Fort Worth, Texas use a blend of the original promise and the \"Outlander Promise\" which, \"according to tradition\", B-P wrote for Scouts that had to omit the reference to God or a monarch for reasons of conscience.\n\n"}

It premiered on CBS on September 22, 2005, and concluded with its fifteenth season on February 19, 2020. It follows a group of criminal profilers who work for the FBI as members of its Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU), using behavioral analysis and profiling to investigate crimes and find perpetrators. The show tells the story of the team as they work various cases, and tackle their personal struggles.\n\nThe show's original main cast consisted of seven characters: Jason Gideon (Mandy Patinkin), Aaron Hotchner (Thomas Gibson), Elle Greenaway (Lola Glaudini), Derek Morgan (Shemar Moore), Spencer Reid (Matthew Gray Gubler), Jennifer Jareau (A. J. Cook), and Penelope Garcia (Kirsten Vangsness). The cast underwent major changes throughout the series' run, with several of the show's original members being replaced by nine additional starring characters: Emily Prentiss (Paget Brewster), David Rossi (Joe Mantegna), Ashley Seaver (Rachel Nichols), Alex Blake (Jeanne Tripplehorn), Kate Callahan (Jennifer Love Hewitt), Tara Lewis (Aisha Tyler), Luke Alvez (Adam Rodriguez), Stephen Walker (Damon Gupton), and Matt Simmons (Daniel Henney).\n\n\"Criminal Minds\" gained critical acclaim for its characterization, pacing, atmosphere, acting, directing, and writing. It became a rating hit for CBS, regularly featuring as one of the network's most-watched cable shows throughout its 15-year-long run. Its success has spawned a media franchise, with several spinoffs, including a South Korean adaptation and a video game. The show was renewed for its fifteenth and final season of ten episodes, which aired from January 8, 2020 to February 19, 2020. It was the final series in the franchise to end, following its two spin-off series, \"Criminal Minds: Suspect Behavior\" and \"Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders\" due to the cancellation in the past with low ratings.\n\nWhen the series premiered in September 2005, it featured FBI agents Jason Gideon (Mandy Patinkin), Aaron Hotchner (Thomas Gibson), Elle Greenaway (Lola Glaudini), Derek Morgan (Shemar Moore), Spencer Reid (Matthew Gray Gubler), Jennifer \"JJ\" Jareau (A. J. Cook), and Penelope Garcia (Kirsten Vangsness). For season 1, Garcia was not a main cast member but rather had a recurring role, although she appeared in all but episode five. Glaudini departed the series in season 2 to return to live in New York City; Paget Brewster replaced her in the role of Emily Prentiss.\n\nPatinkin departed the series at the start of season 3, due to being disturbed by its content. Joe Mantegna replaced him as David Rossi, a best-selling author and FBI agent who comes out of retirement. During this season, Cook became pregnant with her first child, and the pregnancy was written into the show. Cook was on maternity leave for part of season 4; her character's void was temporarily replaced by Meta Golding, who played Jordan Todd, an FBI agent who works with the agency's Counter Terrorism Unit.\n\nPrior to the start A.J Cook of season 6, it was announced that Brewster's role would be reduced for the upcoming season, and Cook would be released from her contract; they were replaced by Rachel Nichols as Ashley Seaver, an FBI cadet. The decision to release Cook and Brewster from their contracts resulted in a backlash from fans who signed protest petitions. Subsequently, Cook and Brewster were reinstated in their roles for season 7 and Nichols was released. Brewster then departed from the series after that season; she was replaced in the eighth season by Jeanne Tripplehorn, who played Alex Blake, a linguistics expert. Brewster did however make a guest appearance as Prentiss in the 200th episode.\n\nAfter two seasons, Tripplehorn was released from the show; Jennifer Love Hewitt joined the cast for season 10 as Kate Callahan, a former undercover FBI agent who joins the BAU. During this season, the character of Gideon was killed off by producers off-screen; executive producer and showrunner Erica Messer said this decision was made as it was clear that Patinkin would not return to the series, but he could be featured in a flashback if he were ever to return in the future. \n\nCook and Hewitt were on hiatus from the show due to their pregnancies after production concluded for season 10; Aisha Tyler, who plays Dr. Tara Lewis, joined the show at the start of season 11 in a recurring role, though she appeared in most episodes. Cook returned after seven episodes of season 11, but Hewitt did not return to the show again. Moore departed later that same season; he had considered leaving in season 10 when his previous contract ended, but was persuaded to stay to give his character a proper sendoff. Messer said it was initially planned for Moore to do six episodes, but it was decided to extend this to the first 18 episodes of season 11 as six episodes \"didn't feel like enough\". \n\nA week after Moore left, Paget Brewster made her second special guest appearance; in season 12, Brewster once again became a series regular. Moore was replaced in the twelfth season by Adam Rodriguez, as Luke Alvez, a Fugitive Task Force Agent. Tyler was also promoted to series regular from this season. Following this, Gibson was suspended, and later fired, from the program due to an on-set altercation with one of the producers; his character Hotchner was written out of the show. Gibson was replaced by Damon Gupton as Stephen Walker, a seasoned profiler from the Behavioral Analysis Program (the counterintelligence division of the FBI) who will bring his spy-hunting skills to the BAU. Gupton's contract was not renewed after season 12, with CBS stating his departure was \"part of a creative change on the show\". Daniel Henney, who was a series regular on spin-off series \"\" as Matt Simmons, joined the main show as a series regular for season 13.\n\nOn April 26, 2019, it was announced that the series finale would be titled \"And in the End\".\n\n\n\nA total of 324 episodes have been aired.\n\nThe first season of \"Criminal Minds\" received mixed reviews from critics. It has a Metacritic score of 42 based on 21 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nDorothy Rabinowitz said, in her review for \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"From the evidence of the first few episodes, \"Criminal Minds\" may be a hit, and deservedly\" and gave particular praise to Gubler and Patinkin's performance. Ned Martel in \"The New York Times\" was less positive, saying, \"The problem with \"Criminal Minds\" is its many confusing maladies, applied to too many characters.\" The reviewer felt that \"as a result, the cast seems like a spilled trunk of broken toys, with which the audience—and perhaps the creators—may quickly become bored.\" \"The Chicago Tribune\" reviewer, Sid Smith, felt that the show \"may well be worth a look\", though he too criticized the \"confusing plots and characters\". Writing in \"PopMatters\", Marco Lanzagorta criticized the show after its premiere, saying it \"confuses critical thinking with supernatural abilities\" and that its characters conform to stereotypes. In the \"Los Angeles Times\", Mary McNamara gave a similar review, and praised Patinkin and Gubler's performances.\n\nIn 2016, a study by \"The New York Times\" of the 50 TV shows with the most Facebook Likes found that \"like several of the other police procedurals\", \"Criminal Minds\" \"is more popular in rural areas, particularly in the southeastern half of the country. It hits peak popularity in Alabama and rural Tennessee and is least popular in Santa Barbara, Calif.\"\n\nThe series is in syndication on the A&E Network and Ion Television, as well as on We TV and Sundance TV. Early seasons of the show have also begun airing on Rewind Networks's HITS TV channel in Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.\n\n\"Criminal Minds\" typically ranks in the top-ten in Digital video recorder (DVR) playback, drawing in a range of 2 to 3 million viewers, according to Nielsen prime DVR lift data. For the week of October 10, 2010, the show peaked at sixth in DVR playback, gaining 2.40 million viewers, while also ranking seventh in demo playback (1.0 demo).\n\n\"Criminal Minds\" has produced two spin-offs: \"\" and \"\", as well as a video game.\n\nThe Season 5 episode, \"The Fight\", introduced a second BAU team and launched a new series called \"Criminal Minds: Suspect Behavior\". The spin-off series debuted February 16, 2011, on CBS but was canceled after a short 13-episode season owing to low ratings. On September 6, 2011, CBS DVD released The Complete Series on a four-disc set. It was packaged as \"The DVD Edition\".\n\nThe cast features Forest Whitaker as the lead role of Sam Cooper; including Janeane Garofalo, Michael Kelly, Beau Garrett, Matt Ryan, Richard Schiff, and Kirsten Vangsness, who reprises her role as Penelope Garcia from the original series.\n\nA proposed new series in the Criminal Minds franchise to be named \"Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders\" was announced in January 2015. Former \"\" star Gary Sinise (who is also a producer on the show) and Anna Gunn were cast in the lead roles of and Lily Lambert, though the latter departed after the backdoor pilot. Tyler James Williams has been cast as Russ \"Monty\" Montgomery and Daniel Henney as Matt Simmons, with Alana de la Garza as Clara Seger and Annie Funke as Mae Jarvis further being cast as series regulars.\n\nThe series follows the FBI agents of the International Response Team (IRT) helping American citizens who are in trouble abroad. CBS aired a backdoor pilot on April 8, 2015 in the \"Criminal Minds\" slot, with a crossover episode titled \"Beyond Borders\". The second spin-off series debuted March 16, 2016, on CBS. On May 16, 2016, CBS renewed the series for a second season. On May 14, 2017, CBS canceled the series after two seasons due to low ratings.\n\nIn 2017, tvN launched their own Korean version of \"Criminal Minds\". The episodes are based on the original American version after its third season. On the cast is Lee Joon-gi as Kim Hyun-joon (Derek Morgan), Moon Chae Won as Ha Sun-woo (Emily Prentiss), Son Hyun-joo as Kang Ki-hyung (Aaron Hotchner), Yoo Sun as Nana Hwang (Penelope Garcia), Lee Sun-bin as Yoo Min-young (Jennifer Jareau), and Go Yoon as Lee Han (Spencer Reid).\nThe episodes are 1 hour long.\n\nCBS announced in October 2009 that Legacy Interactive would develop a video game based on the show. The game would require players to examine crime scenes for clues to help solve murder mysteries. The interactive puzzle game was released in 2012, but the show's cast was not involved with the project so it did not feature any of their voices.\n\nThe second game, developed by FTX Games was released on October 29, 2018 on Android & iOS devices.\n\n"}

Inpop's stated goal is to discover the best artists around the world that understand the grace of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and who also have something new and unique to offer the world of Christian music.\n\n\n"}

Mexicans refer to them as burritos, and they come in different ingredient varieties, primarily wheat flour or corn, typically filled with meat, beans, rice, cheese, and other ingredients.\n\nThe wrap in its Western form probably comes from California, as a generalization of the Tex-Mex burrito, and became popular in the 1990s. It may have been invented and named at a southern California chain called \"I Love Juicy\" in the early 1980s. The OVO Bistro in NYC introduced its wrap sandwich in 1990 under the name \"The King Edward,\" The Bobby Valentine Sports Gallery Cafe in Stamford, Connecticut is sometimes claimed to have invented the wrap at about the same time, but Valentine is diffident about it: \"Well, that's legend and folklore, but until somebody disputes me or comes up with a better story, I'll say I invented the wrap.\" Beth Dolan of Stamford, Connecticut is the waitress credited for serving the first wrap after the restaurant had run out of bread. Moreover, Valentine's own story dates his use of the \"name\" 'wrap' to the mid-1990s, after it is documented in California. San Francisco-based chain World Wrapps, which opened its first location in February 1995, is credited with popularizing the wrap nationwide.\n\nIn the 1900s, Kati roll became a popular street-food in Kolkata, India, with kebab wrapped in paratha bread; although over the years many variants have evolved all of which now go under the generic name of kati roll. Restaurants such as Camille's Sidewalk Cafe, Sonic Drive-In, Jason's Deli, Buffalo Wild Wings, Subway, Chick-fil-A, Roly Poly and McAlister's Deli serve wraps. KFC now serves its chicken in a wrap as menu choice, with lettuce, mayonnaise and salsa. McDonald's has a snack wrap, with a fried, or grilled chicken strip, lettuce, cheddar, and ranch dressing. Smokey Bones Barbeque and Grill has recently introduced a Portobello Chicken Wrap to broaden their selection of grilled menu items.\n\n"}

It is the second center of population on the island, besides the city of Avalon. It is mainly a resort village. It has only one restaurant, one hotel and one general store. The village has about 150 permanent residents who live on the isthmus year-round. One notable feature was the one-room schoolhouse which closed in 2014.\n\nTwo Harbors is a small island village located approximately from San Pedro Harbor on Santa Catalina Island. On the island's narrow isthmus, it is located about 18 miles from the only city on the island, Avalon. It is named for the two harbors separated by the 770 m section of land separating the leeward (northern) Isthmus Cove (aka Banning Harbor) and Catalina (or Cat) Harbor on the windward (southern) side, which together almost cut off the northwestern sixth (31.7 km²) from the main part of the island. White Rock Island, commonly known as Bird Rock, is a small privately owned island only 6312 m² in size. It is approximately northeast of Two Harbors, offshore from Isthmus Cove, and northwest of the closest coastal point.\n\nThe area where Two Harbors is located was originally referred to simply as the Isthmus of Catalina Island. By the 1860s, mining operations for silver, lead and zinc took place in the area. In 1864, during the Civil War, the Union Army sent 83 soldiers to the island to establish Camp Santa Catalina Island, both to protect the area from Confederate privateers and survey the isthmus and adjacent Catalina Harbor for the Bureau of Indian Affairs as a location for a future Indian reservation for \"militant\" tribes captured in the Bald Hills War. However, the reservation idea was abandoned and so was the camp. The barracks that the Army built on the isthmus were later used to house visiting film crews in the 1920s and 1930s, a contingent of the U.S. Coast Guard during World War II, and in 1951 became the home of the Isthmus Yacht Club.\n\nThe \"Ning Po\", a Chinese merchant ship built in 1753 and involved in over a century of war, rebellion, and piracy, eventually found its way to Catalina and was converted into a tourist attraction in 1913. The Ning Po burned off the western shore of the isthmus in 1938. The fire which destroyed her also claimed several wooden sailing vessels that had been used in filming motion-picture \"spectaculars\", including the famous old down-Easter \"Llewellyn J. Morse\" which stood in for the — with accurate re-rigging — in the silent film \"Old Ironsides (film)\".\n\nTwo Harbors is part of the Long Beach Unified School District. The one-room school closed in 2014 due to sharply declining enrollment. School age children now attend Avalon Schools K-12.\n\nThe USC Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies is an environmental research and education facility run by the University of Southern California in Two Harbors. The campus consists of a 2,800 square-meter (30,000 square-foot) laboratory building, a dormitory housing, a cafeteria, a hyperbaric chamber, and a large waterfront staging area complete with dock, pier, helipad, and diving lockers. The facility was made possible by a donation from the Wrigley family and was named for Philip K. Wrigley.\n\nTwo Harbors is served by ferry lines with regular daily service to San Pedro. A helicopter can also be chartered to the village. The Catalina Airport-In-The-Sky is away to the east. Alternatively, various charter boats offer private service to the island.\n\nMost people generally walk, but shuttles are available, as are full-sized motor vehicles.\n\nTo get around the island from Two Harbors, one can get a bus that can take them anywhere on the island, or one can hike. Taxi service is also available between Avalon and Two Harbors.\n\n\n"}

Her parents are Russian pop star Alla Pugacheva and Lithuanian circus performer .\n\nKristina Orbakaite was born in Moscow and spent much of her childhood between Šventoji, Lithuania, the home of her paternal grandparents, and Moscow, the home of her maternal grandparents. After her parents divorced in 1973, she was brought to Moscow by her mother, Alla Pugacheva, and lived with her maternal grandparents.\n\nAt the age of 7, she debuted in the Soviet children's television program \"Veseliye Notki\" \"(Happy Musical Notes)\" with the song \"Solnyshko Smeyotsya\" (\"The Sun Laughs\"). In 1982, she was cast in the leading role of \"Lena Bessoltseva\" in \"Scarecrow\", a film by Rolan Bykov based on the Vladimir Zheleznikov play of the same name. Production began in 1982 and the film premiered in 1984. It became a critical success, not only in Russia but also overseas, and turned Orbakaite into a child star.\n\nAlongside her acting, Orbakaite continued with her budding singing career. In 1983, she sang \"A znayesh, vse yesche budet\" (You know, it will all happen yet) in a duet with her mother. In 1985, she sang the song \"Pust' Govoryat\" in the popular TV program \"Utrenyaya Pochta\" (Morning Mail).\n\nNow a young woman, Kristina appeared in the films \"Viva Gardes-Marines!\" (1991), \"Gardes-Marines-III\" (1992), \"Blagotvoritelny Bal\" (1993), and \"Limita\" (1994). In 1992, she sang \"Pogovorim\" (We'll talk) at a holiday show sponsored by her mother. The song became a hit and launched Orbakaite as a pop star. In 1994, she released her debut album titled \"Vernost\" (Fidelity).\n\nHaving met with success in film and music, Orbakaite tried her hand at theater, appearing in 1995 as Helen Keller in an adaptation of William Gibson's \"The Miracle Worker\" on the stage of the Moscow Art Theatre. She subsequently received an award from the Russian Ministry of Culture for best female theatrical performance.\n\nIn 1996, Orbakaite joined her mother, Alla Pugacheva, her mother's husband, singer Philipp Kirkorov, and her partner, singer Vladimir Presnyakov on a family performance tour through the United States titled \"Zvezdnoye Leto\" (Starry Summer). During this tour, she performed for the first time at Carnegie Hall in New York City. Later the same year, Orbakaite released her second album, titled \"Nol' Chasov, Nol' Minut\" (Zero Hours, Zero Minutes).\n\nIn 1998, Orbakaite released her third solo album, \"Ty\" (You). It included 12 new songs, including \"Muzikant\" (Musician), \"Navsegda\" (Forever), \"Pegiy P'yos\" (Spotted Dog), \"Smorodina\" (Currant), and \"Ptitsy\" (Birds). She also appeared in the films \"Doroga, dorogoy, dorogaya\" (1997, Road, dear [addressing a male], dear [addressing a female]) and \"Fara\" (1998).\n\nIn 2000, Orbakaite won World Music Awards in Monte Carlo as the best-selling Russian singer. Later that year, she released her fourth album \"May\". In 2001, she appeared in the film \"Zhenskoye schastye\" (A Woman's Happiness).\n\nIn 2002, she released her fifth album, \"Ver v chudesa\" (Believe in miracles) and appeared in the television series \"Moscow Saga\". She again became Russia's best-selling singer and won the World Music Awards for the second time. In 2003, she released her sixth album, \"Pereletnaya ptitsa\" (Wandering bird) and in 2005, she released her seventh album, \"My life\". The same year, she won the Muz-TV award in the category \"Best female singer\".\n\nOn 17 January 2004 Kristina met her husband, American businessman Mikhail Zemtsov in Miami. They married in a private ceremony on 9 March 2005 in Miami Beach city hall.\nIn 2006, Orbakaite appeared in the comedy \"Lyubov-morkov\" (Love-carrot) together with Gosha Kutsenko. The film was a hit in Russia, bringing in a domestic box office of $11.5 million, and spawning two sequels, with the second film coming out in 2008 and the third in 2011. Amid filming the series, Orbakaite released her eight album, titled \"Slyshish – eto ya\" (Listen – it's me).\n\nIn 2011, Orbakaite celebrated her 40th birthday and, as part of celebrating the year, unveiled a new performance program and a new album, both titled \"Potseluy na bis\" (Encore kiss). Two years later, in April 2013, she released a new music video for her song \"Maski\" (Masks) and began a tour of the Baltic countries. She also received the title Honoured Artist of the Russian Federation from Russian president Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn December 2016, her \"Insomnia\" world tour was presented with two sold out shows in State Kremlin Palace. The tour received excellent reviews in the press and with critics. In 2017, the tour was presented in Russia, Israel, France, Kazakhstan, the United Kingdom, Germany and all Baltic states with over 100 sold out shows.\n\nIn July 2018 Kristina Orbakaite debuted on stage of Sovremennik Theater in a William Gibson play \"Two for the Seesaw\".\n\nIn September 2018, she released her scandalous music video to her hit \"Pyanaya Vishnya\" which was watched over 40 million times on YouTube in less than one year.\n\nShe is currently married to a Russian-American businessman named Mikhail Zemtsov. They have a daughter, born on 30 March 2012. Orbakaite also has two sons from previous marriages, born in 1991 and 1998.\n\n\n\n\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"background: cyan;\" | World Music Awards\n"}
{"id": "2223222", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2223222", "title": "Aaron ben Elijah", "text": "Aaron ben Elijah\n\nAaron ben Elijah (Aharon son of Eliyahu), \"the Latter, of Nicomedia\" (אהרון בן אליהו האחרון‎ 1328/1329 – 1369) is often considered to be the most prominent Karaite theologian. He is referred to as \"the Younger\" to distinguish him from Aaron the Elder. Even though Aaron lived for much of his life in Constantinople, he is sometimes distinguished from another Aaron Ben Elijah (also a theologian from Constantinople, which was then the center of Karaite learning) by the title \"of Nicomedia,\" signifying another place he lived.\n\nHe was born in Nicomedia. While little is known about his personal life, he is considered by Karaites to be the equivalent of his contemporary, Maimonides, the most distinguished Jewish scholar of the time and an outspoken critic of the Karaites. In fact, it seems likely that Aaron made it his ambition to rival Maimonides by defending the Karaites from his attacks. To achieve this, he studied the extensive religious literature of both rabbinical Judaism and Islam, as well as that of the Karaites.\n\nThe result of his studies was \"Etz HaChayyim\" (\"Tree of Life\"; 1346), a philosophical work modeled after Maimonides' own \"Moreh Nevuchim\" (\"Guide to the Perplexed\"). In fact, one of the chief criticisms of the work is that it attempts to imitate Maimonides' \"Guide\" far too slavishly, in terms of both structure and style. In 1354, while living in Constantinople, he composed his second major work, \"Gan Eden\" (\"The Garden of Eden\"), about the commandments of the Bible and an attempt to defend the Karaite legal code and in 1362 he wrote \"Keter Torah\" (\"Crown of the Torah\"), a comprehensive commentary on the Pentateuch using a literal interpretation of the writings. He died in Constantinople, Byzantine Empire.\n\nAaron was neither as profound or independent-minded as Maimonides, for whom he maintained great esteem even when opposing him. Nevertheless, he was a versatile compiler and eclectic, if not always original, philosopher, who succeeded in restoring some prestige to the Karaite community, which have been in decline ever since it was forced to fend off the attacks of Saadia Gaon. Furthermore, some of his critiques of the Maimonidean worldview can be considered reasonable and sound.\n\nAaron ben Elijah was heavily influenced by the works of Aristotle. Unlike Maimonides, however, Aaron accepted the Muslim Motazilite philosophical system of Kalam, combining atomism with Aristotelean views to reconcile revelation with philosophy — in this, he differed not only from Maimonides but also from Aaron Ben Joseph, the Elder, who sided with Maimonides in this debate. According to the younger Aaron, in the first chapters of \"Etz HaChayyim\", the theology of the Kalam is the natural religion arrived at by Abraham through meditation and systematized by the Mosaic Law; while Greek philosophy, adopted by Christianity because of its hostility to Judaism, is a heterogeneous foreign product, harmful to the development of the Torah in its purity. He then declares that the object of his work is to restore the theology of the Kalam by presenting it in a clear manner.\n\nThe book \"Etz HaChayyim\" (Tree of Life) was written in 1346 and consists of 114 chapters:\n\n\nAaron's work on the Commandments, entitled \"Gan Eden\" (The Garden of Eden), consists of twenty-five sections and 194 chapters, as well as nine smaller juridical articles, which became of paramount importance to the Karaites. It was written in 1354. He follows a rational approach to the commandments, similar to the one espoused by Maimonides. He opens with the principle that instilling the belief in God's unity, and especially in His government of the world, is the ultimate purpose of every commandment, so that it is the duty of humanity to seek the underlying objective of each commandment. For example, the goal of the Sabbath is inculcating a belief in the Divine creation and guidance of the world; other festivals are intended to counteract the influences of paganism and fatalism.\n\nTwo parts of \"Gan Eden\" have appeared as separate books:\n\nIn its entirety, \"Gan Eden\" is probably the best and most comprehensive exposition of the Karaite system of the Law, presenting the opinions of all Aaron's predecessors with impartial and frank criticism. It is mainly because of this work that Aaron continues to wield such a great influence upon the Karaites.\n\nHis third book was titled \"Keter Torah\" (Crown of Law) and was written in 1362. This is a commentary on the Torah, styled after Abraham Ibn Ezra's earlier work. Like all of Aaron's earlier writings, it also contains a review of the philosophical and exegetical interpretations given by his predecessors, with critiques of their views where necessary. Particularly interesting is his \"Preface,\" in which he states the main differences between the approach to biblical exegesis of Rabbinic and Karaite Judaism.\n\nThe \" 'Etz ha-Ḥayyim,\" of which many manuscripts exist in Leiden, Munich, Vienna, and Leipzig, was first published, with a large commentary (\"Or ha-Ḥayyim\") by Luzki, in Koslov, 1835. A critical edition, with valuable information and a summary of the one hundred and fourteen chapters in Hebrew by Caleb Afendopulo, and one in German by the editor, Franz Delitzsch, appeared in Leipzig, 1841. Of the \"Keter Torah\" there is extant a Eupatoria edition (1866), besides manuscripts in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, in Vienna, and in Leipzig; while the \"Gan Eden\" exists, in manuscript only, in Leiden and Leipzig. Portions of the latter have been published by Schupart, Trigland, Danz, and Langhausen.\n\n"}
{"id": "2223233", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2223233", "title": "Edgeworth David", "text": "Edgeworth David\n\nSir Tannatt William Edgeworth David (28 January 1858 – 28 August 1934) was a Welsh Australian geologist and Antarctic explorer. A household name in his lifetime, David's most significant achievements were discovering the major Hunter Valley coalfield in New South Wales and leading the first expedition to reach the South Magnetic Pole. He also served with distinction in World War I.\n\nDavid was born on 28 January 1858, in St. Fagans near Cardiff, Wales, the eldest son of the Rev. William David, a fellow of Jesus College, Oxford, a classical scholar and naturalist and his wife Margaret Harriette (née Thomson). His mother's cousin, William A. E. Ussher of the Geological Survey, first interested David in what was to be his life work.\n\nAt the age of 12, David went to Magdalen College School, Oxford in 1870. In 1876 he gained a classical scholarship to New College, Oxford. While there he was lectured by the famous John Ruskin and William Spooner. In 1878 he suffered a health breakdown and travelled to Canada and Australia to recuperate. Returning to Oxford, he attended lectures on geology by Sir Joseph Prestwich which stimulated his interest in the subject. After graduating as a Bachelor of Arts without honours in 1880, he spent the following two years in field study of the geology of Wales. In November 1881 he read his first paper, \"Evidences of Glacial Action in the Neighbourhood of Cardiff\" before the Cardiff Naturalists' Society. In the following year he briefly studied at the Royal School of Mines, London, under Professor J.W. Judd before accepting the position of Assistant Geological Surveyor to the Government of New South Wales, Australia.\n\nDavid took up his post in November 1882. In 1884 his report on the tin deposits in the New England district was published, and three years later it was expanded into the \"Geology of the Vegetable Creek Tin Mining Field, New England District\". Apart from its scientific interest this was valuable in connection with the mining operations on this field, from which some £10,000,000 worth of tin was won. On 30 July 1885 he married Caroline (Cara) Mallett, principal of the Hurlstone Training College for Teachers, who had travelled to Australia in the same vessel with him.\n\nIn April 1886 he began surveying the Hunter Valley coalfields and in August discovered the Greta coal seam, which yielded over £50,000,000 worth of coal up to 1949. Much of his time during the next four years was spent near Maitland where he was still tracing and mapping the coal measures and reporting to the government on other matters of commercial value. David's assistant in 1890 was William Sutherland Dun.\n\nIn 1891 David was appointed Professor of Geology at the University of Sydney, a position he held until 1924.\n\nDavid was not only a good scientist but very cultured, with a sense of humour, great enthusiasm, sympathy, and courtesy, and he quickly fitted into his new position. His department was housed in a small cottage, its equipment was poor, and he had no lecturers or demonstrators; but he gradually got better facilities and built up his department. In 1892 he was president of the geological section of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science at the Hobart meeting, and held the same position at Brisbane in 1895.\n\nIn 1896 David went to the Pacific atoll of Funafuti as part of an expedition under Professor William Sollas of Oxford in order to take borings which it was hoped would settle the question of the formation of coral atolls. There were defects in the boring machinery and the bore penetrated only slightly more than 100 feet (approx. 31 m). In 1897 David led a second expedition (that included George Sweet as second-in-command, and Walter George Woolnough) which succeeded in reaching a depth of 557 feet (170 m) after which he had to return to Sydney. He then organised a third expedition in 1898 which, under the leadership of Dr. Alfred Edmund Finckh, was successful in carrying the bore to 1114 feet (340 m). The results provided support for Charles Darwin's theory of subsidence, and the expeditions made David's name as a geologist. Cara accompanied him on the second expedition and published a well-received account called \"Funafuti, or Three Months on a Coral Island\".\n\nDavid's reputation was growing in Europe, and in 1899 he was awarded the Bigsby Medal by the Geological Society of London, and in 1900 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society. From 1900 to 1907 he conducted field studies of glaciation in the Kosciusko plateau and Precambrian glaciation in South Australia.\n\nIn 1904 David was elected president of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science which met in Dunedin, and in 1906 he attended the International Geological Congress held in Mexico. On his way back to Australia he was able to see the Grand Canyon of the Colorado and to study the effect of the San Francisco earthquake.\n\nIn mid-1907 David was invited to join Shackleton's Nimrod Expedition to the Antarctic and in December won Australian Government funding for the expedition. The same month he left for New Zealand with Leo Cotton and Douglas Mawson, two of his former students. David was nearly 50 years of age and it was intended that he would stay only until April 1908, but en route to Antarctica on the \"Nimrod\" he altered his plans and decided to stay for the whole expedition.\n\nFrom 5 to 11 March 1908, David led the first ascent of Mount Erebus, the only active volcano in Antarctica. David led the summit party consisting of Mawson, Dr Alistair Mackay and himself, and there was a supporting party of three which it was afterwards decided should also attempt to reach the summit. In this they were successful in spite of a blizzard which barred their progress for a day and night. One member of the party had his feet badly frostbitten, and had to be left in camp before the final dash, but David and four others reached the summit and the whole party returned to the base.\n\nOn 5 October 1908, David led Mawson and Mackay on an attempt to reach the Magnetic South Pole. For ten weeks the men followed the coast north supplementing their stores with a diet of seals and penguins. They then crossed the Drygalski Ice Tongue and turned inland. They still faced a 700 km return journey and established a depot to enable them to transfer their load to one overladen sled and to remove the need to relay. On 16 January 1909 they finally arrived at the South Magnetic Pole and took possession of the region for the British Crown.\n\nEdgeworth David had been appointed leader of the expedition by Shackleton but by the end of January with all three of the party experiencing severe physical deterioration, David was increasingly unable to contribute. On 31 January Mackay exerted his authority as the party's doctor and threatened to declare the Professor insane unless he gave written authority of leadership to Mawson. Mawson took command, writing in his diary on 3 February \"the Prof was now certainly partly demented\". That day the party reached the coast line with perfect timing as within 24 hours they were collected by the \"Nimrod\" for the return trip to Cape Royds. The trio had covered a distance of 1260 miles which stood as the longest unsupported sled journey until the mid-1980s.\n\nShackleton's expedition returned to New Zealand on 25 March 1909. When David returned to Sydney he was presented with the Mueller medal by the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science at a rapturous official welcome.\n\nAt Shackleton's request David then went on a lecture tour, and earned enough money to pay the expenses of publication of the two volumes on the geology of the expedition. He also wrote his \"Narrative of the Magnetic Pole Journey\", which appeared in the second volume of Shackleton's Heart of the Antarctic. In 1910 the honour of Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George was conferred on him, and visiting England in connexion with the scientific results of the Antarctic expedition, Oxford University gave him the honorary degree of Doctor of Science. In 1911–12 he provided public and practical support for the Japanese Antarctic Expedition which was wintering in Sydney. In 1913 he was elected for the second time president of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science and in 1926 presented with the Patron's Gold Medal of the Royal Geographical Society.\n\nWhen World War I broke out in 1914, David was a strenuous supporter of the war effort, supporting the campaign for conscription. In August 1915, after reading reports about mining operations and tunnelling during the Gallipoli Campaign, along with Professor Ernest Skeats, a professor at the University of Melbourne, David wrote a proposal to Senator George Pearce, the Australian Defence Minister, suggesting that the government raise a military force to undertake mining and tunnelling. After the proposal was accepted, David used his advocacy and organisational abilities to set up the Australian Mining Corps, and on 25 October 1915 he was appointed as a major, at the age of 57.\n\nThe first contingent of the corps consisted of 1,300 officers and men that were initially organised into two battalions before being reorganised into three tunnelling companies, as well as an electrical and mechanical mining company. After departing Australia for the United Kingdom in February 1916, the corps arrived on the Western Front in May 1916. Given the title 'Geological Adviser to the Controllers of Mines in the First, Second and Third Armies', David became relatively independent and spent his time in geological investigations, using his expertise to advise on the construction of dugouts, trenches, and tunnels, the siting of wells for provision of pure drinking water from underground supplies, giving lectures, and producing maps. In September 1916 he fell to the bottom of a well he was examining, breaking two ribs and rupturing his urethra. He was invalided to London but returned to the Front in November, assuming the role of geological technical advisor to the British Expeditionary Force.\n\nOn 7 June 1917 his wartime contribution culminated in the mining of German positions in the Battle of Messines. In January 1918, David was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and in November he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. The war having concluded, he was demobilised in 1919. He was also Mentioned in Despatches twice.\n\nIn 1896 the Davids bought 26 acres (10.5 hectares) at Woodford, in the Blue Mountains, with an existing weatherboard cottage, two-roomed with two skillion rooms at the back. To emphasise his Welsh origins, Edgeworth David named the Woodford cottage ‘Tyn-y-Coed’, the 'house in the trees' (often mistranslated as 'the shack in the bush': 'ty' is a proper house in Welsh, not a mere hut).\n\nIn 1915 the Davids offered their home to the Red Cross convalescent home for the rehabilitation of injured servicemen and the Woodford Academy boys erected a flagstaff for the Union Jack and Red Cross flags for the soldiers in residence. When the Cooee marchers trooped past in November 1915 some of the wounded soldiers were brought up to the main road to greet the marchers.\nAlthough they had work and commitments in Sydney, Woodford was the David's primary residence from 1899 until 1920. They retained the Woodford cottage as a favoured country retreat until Edgeworth's death in 1934.\nTyn-y-Coed was destroyed by bushfire in 1944 with only a chimney stump remaining. Its grounds are now occupied by eight modern houses, their gardens and adjoining bush.\nIn September 1920, David was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire for services during the war.\n\nReturning to Australia, David purchased \"Coringah\", a cottage in the Sydney suburb of Hornsby. He also took up a long-cherished project, the writing of a definitive work, \"The Geology of the Commonwealth of Australia\". In 1921–22 David helped set up the Australian National Research Council and served as its first President. In 1924 he retired as Professor of Geology at the University of Sydney, the chair passing to his student Leo Cotton, a neighbour in Hornsby, New South Wales, whose brother Max Cotton created Lisgar Gardens in Hornsby. In 1928 he discovered what he believed were Precambrian fossils, creating controversy which remained until his death.\n\nIn 1931 he published the \"Geological Map of the Commonwealth\" and the accompanying \"Explanatory Notes\", designed to be part of his \"Geology of the Commonwealth of Australia\". He died in 1934 without being able to complete this work and was given a state funeral.\n\nDavid's \"The Geology of the Commonwealth of Australia\" was finally completed by his chosen collaborator, Associate Professor William R. Browne in 1950. Of his many papers, over 100 will be found listed in the \"Geological Magazine\" for January 1922. A travelling scholarship in his memory was founded at the University of Sydney in 1936.\n\nThe Edgeworth David Medal is named in his honour. It is awarded by the Royal Society of New South Wales for distinguished contributions by a young scientist under the age of thirty-five for work done mainly in Australia or its territories. The mineral davidite is named after him, as was the Edgeworth David Building (demolished 2006) at the University of Sydney and Edgeworth David Avenue in Hornsby, New South Wales where he spent his later years. He has been depicted on two Australian postage stamps. The Edgeworth David Building at Tighes Hill TAFE campus in the New South Wales Hunter Valley is named in his honour.\n\nEdgeworth David Base is the name of a summer station in the Bunger Hills area of Antarctica. It has been maintained by Australia since 1986.\n\nThe suburb of Edgeworth in the Hunter Region, New South Wales, is named after David.\n\nThe Edgeworth David quarry in Seaham, New South Wales is named after David, who discovered varve shale there in 1914.\n\nThe boreholes on Funafuti, Tuvalu are known as \"David's Drill\".\n\nIn 1968 he was honoured on a postage stamp issued by Australia Post.\n\nEdgeworth David's daughter Margaret McIntyre was the first woman elected to the Parliament of Tasmania and was awarded the Order of the British Empire.\n\nHis former home, \"Coringah\", in the Sydney suburb of Hornsby, was acquired by Hornsby Council in 1999 and turned into the Edgeworth David Garden, which is open to the public. It is heritage-listed.\n\n\n\n"}

The series was very popular and introduced the Sun-4c architecture, a variant of the Sun-4 architecture previously introduced in the Sun 4/260. Thanks in part to the delay in the development of more modern processors from Motorola, the SPARCstation series was very successful across the entire industry. The last model bearing the SPARCstation name was the SPARCstation 20. The workstation series was replaced by the Sun Ultra series in 1995; the next Sun server generation was the Sun Enterprise line introduced in 1996.\n\nDesktop and deskside SPARCstations and SPARCservers of the same model number were essentially identical systems, the only difference being that systems designated as servers were usually \"headless\" (that is, configured without a graphics card and monitor), and were sold with a \"server\" rather than a \"desktop\" OS license. For example, the SPARCstation 20 and SPARCserver 20 were almost identical in motherboard, CPU, case design and most other hardware specifications.\n\nMost desktop SPARCstations and SPARCservers shipped in either \"pizzabox\" or \"lunchbox\" enclosures, a significant departure from earlier Sun and competing systems of the time. The SPARCstation 1, 2, 4, 5, 10 and 20 were \"pizzabox\" machines. The SPARCstation SLC and ELC were integrated into Sun monochrome monitor enclosures, and the SPARCstation IPC, IPX, SPARCclassic, SPARCclassic X and SPARCstation LX were \"lunchbox\" machines.\n\nSPARCserver models ending in \"30\" or \"70\" were housed in deskside pedestal enclosures (respectively 5-slot and 12-slot VMEbus chassis); models ending in \"90\" and the SPARCcenter 2000 came in rackmount cabinet enclosures. The SPARCserver 1000's design was a large rack-mountable desktop unit.\n\nLater versions of the SPARCstation series, such as the SPARCstation 10 and 20, could be configured as multiprocessor systems as they were based on the MBus high-speed bus. These systems could accept one or two single or dual central processing units packaged in MBus modules.\n\nUntil the launch of the SPARCserver 600MP series, all SPARCstation/server models were also assigned Sun 4-series model numbers. Later models received S-prefix model numbers.\n\nModels are listed within their category in approximately chronological order.\n\nNote that the above configurations were those supported by Sun Microsystems. Various third-party processor upgrades were available for SPARCstation/server systems, for instance the 80 MHz Weitek POWER μP for the SPARCstation 2 or IPX, or the Ross hyperSPARC MBus modules rated at clock speeds up to 200 MHz. As mentioned above, some models listed as SPARCstations were also available in SPARCserver configuration and vice versa.\n\nThe CS6400 was developed by an outside group working cooperatively with, rather than competitively against, Sun Microsystems; as a result, although sold by Cray Research as the \"Cray Superserver 6400\", all of its components had Sun OEM part numbers and the machine was documented in Sun's System Handbook. In 1996, when Cray Research was bought by Silicon Graphics, the CS6400 development group was sold to Sun, and released the 64-processor Sun Ultra Enterprise 10000 \"Starfire\" the following year.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2223246", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2223246", "title": "El Vacilón de la Mañana", "text": "El Vacilón de la Mañana\n\nEl Vacilón de la Mañana is a Spanish language weekday morning radio show. The show originates from WSKQ-FM in New York City, a Spanish radio station branded as \"Mega 97.9\", and it is syndicated live to a number of different markets in the US such as Providence, Rhode Island; Miami and Orlando, Florida; Atlanta, Georgia; Hartford, Connecticut; and Puerto Rico.7\n\nThe word \"vacilón\" is not directly translatable into English; it derives from the Spanish verb \"vacilar\" (to vacillate), but in colloquial Spanish can also mean to \"check someone out\" or to \"have fun.\" Thus, the show's name roughly translates in English to \"The Morning Tease.\"\n\nDuring the first two weeks of January 2007, new airings of this program were discontinued, and only pre-recorded programs were aired, coinciding with Luis Jiménez's departure from the program. He has signed a contract with the Univision Radio network, but is prevented by previous non-competitive agreements to air any new program in New York City during El Vacilón's allotted time slot until 2008. Most of the program's crew has chosen to remain contracted to La Mega.and contract DJ CASTRO from Texas and Sonido Promax #1 in California, thanks to him is now the number one in USA.\n\nAs of mid January 2007, Spanish Broadcasting System (SBS) owned WSKQ (La Mega 97.9 FM) brought two new hosts to the show, Dominican-born Juan Carlos Alonso (who sounds just like Luis Jiménez), and Puerto Rican Frankie Jay (who also sounds like Moonshadow) which are now replacing Luis Jiménez and Moonshadow. Juan Carlos Alonso was relocated from another SBS station in Orlando, Florida and Frankie Jay was relocated from another SBS station in Puerto Rico. Juan Carlos and Frankie Jay voice resemblance to the former hosts have sparked a number of accusations of trying to imitate the former Vacilón hosts Luis Jiménez and Moonshadow (the main reason SBS brought them to NY).\n\nDuring 2007 Luis Jiménez and SBS were involved in a legal fight because SBS claims Luis Jiménez was cashing in on the name of the morning show through the release of his DVD movie \"El Vacilón the Movie\" which was released on January 30, 2007. Luis Jiménez filed a counter-lawsuit accusing SBS of trying to fool the audience by having Juan Carlos and Frankie Jay imitate the voices and style of Luis Jiménez and Moonshadow, and also accuses his former team members of betrayal and stealing his intellectual property by using characters such as Dr. Hector Tilla and Madam Melo. In early January 2008 Spanish Broadcasting System officially won the legal fight.\n\nSince February 21, 2007, Luis Jiménez started producing his own show \"The Luis Jiménez Show\" and it is being broadcast in several cities in the US, such as Dallas, Chicago, Los Angeles, among others through different Univision Radio stations. It is expected to expand into more cities during this year as Univision Radio introduces the show to new markets, but it is not expected to make it into NYC until 2008. Only two of the members of the old \"Vacilón de la Mañana\" have followed Luis Jiménez to his new show. These are \"Yun Yun\" and \"Sonny Flow\", the latter one being \"DJ Chucky\" who just became part of \"The Luis Jiménez Show\" crew. Alma, who is Luis's producer, is also part of the new show in Univision Radio.\n\nMoonshadow has come back to \"El Vacilón de la Mañana\" and together with Juan Carlos and Franky Jay had been able to stay ahead of the \"Luis Jiménez Show\" (3.9 to 2.0 in the ratings). Although when \"The Luis Jiménez Show\" made it to NYC early in 2008.\nUpon his departure from \"El Vacilón de la Mañana\" Luis Jiménez also took the morning show's website with him. For the entire year of 2007 the domain name \"www.elvacilon.com\" belonged to his producer Maria Alma and therefore SBS and WSKQ La Mega 97.9 FM were unable to use the website address for the show. A new website for \"El Vacilón\" was created www.elvacilon.org.In early 2008, after the lawsuit the domain name \"elvacilon dot com\" was returned to SBS and is run on the web servers of Spanish Broadcasting System(SBS)\n\nAn equally named program was broadcast by another SBS affiliate station in Miami: WXDJ-FM (El Zol 95.7), a fact that raised confusion among some listeners in both markets until March 2003. The hosts of \"El Vacilón Miami\" were Enrique Santos (a former police officer turned funny man) and \"The Professor\" Joe Ferrero, both of Cuban-American descent. Early producer of the show Alberto Sardinas also joined the team at the time.\n\nThe two jokesters achieved national and international notoriety when on June 18, 2003 they prank-called Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez, which brought them plenty of press. They later used the same technique to prank-call Cuba's then-President Fidel Castro, the more notorious and more better known of the pranks. The team was fined by the FCC when an anonymous source filed a complaint with said government agency (as a result of the latter prank). The duo took to the streets of Miami and collected in pennies the entire amount of the fee and then some. Luckily, the radio station's legal eagles resolved the issue regarding the fine and all of the money collected was then donated to a local charity. They later used the same technique to crank call. In the history of radio broadcast this was the first time that a morning show had prank-called the leaders of two countries.\n\nDespite of the huge success of El Vacilón Miami, hosted by Enrique and Joe, it all came to a halt on March 5, 2007 when the hosts, fed up with the string of unfulfilled promises by Spanish Broadcasting Systems (SBS) and other issues, decided to walk out on air. They trashed the company for four hours of broadcast until they were eventually pulled off the air by management. The morning show was replaced with pre-recorded bits soon after. One week later, the only one of the show's main producers, Miguel Reyes alias Mikey Machete, was let go by the company. Reyes hosted the Saturday morning \"Best Of\" show which he also produced and achieved the number one spot in ratings for a Saturday morning show in the Tropical market. While SBS refused to give details on Mr. Reyes’ firing, it appeared to be the result of the fall out following the early departure of the show's two hosts.\n\nEnrique Santos and Joe Ferrero were signed to Univision's WRTO, Miami, La Kalle 98.3 FM for the time being. Luis Jiménez's and his morning show were being syndicated in various markets. Univision Radio returned both shows to their respective cities to take on SBS directly on early 2008. Mike Reyes, former producer for Enrique Santos & Joe Ferrero, return to radio also in early 2008 at the end of his non compete\n\nFrom March 22, 2007 to March 1, 2008, \"El Zol 95 FM\" was broadcasting New York's \"El Vacilón de la Mañana\" which was also being syndicated in Puerto Rico. Since March 3, 2008, El Zol started El Vacilón de Miami with Neo Encendido and Los Pichy Boys (Alejandro González and Maikel Rodriguez) from 6 to 10 pm. The latter show was replaced in less than a year by Al Fuentes, former P.D. of various radio stations and Pio Ferro, V.P of Programming of SBS. Soon after that, Pio Ferro's employment was terminated and that morning show had become a one-man show.\n\n\"The Enrique and Joe Show\" (with sidekick and producer Mikey Machete) on Miami's La Kalle 98.3 FM, in less than a years time, once again became the #1 rated Tropical (bi-lingual) morning show in South Florida with ratings numbers reaching double digits. In May 2009, the dynamic duo of Miami radio split up and two shows were created. In the morning \"The Enrique Santos Show\", followed by \"Joe Ferrero y La Animalada\" (originally hosted for 5 months by Mikey Machete and Albertico Rodriguez) on La Kalle 98.3FM.\nIn early spring 2010, changes started to take place in both radio stations and by mid-year, Enrique Santos was the only one from the original morning crew to be retained on 98.3's morning show as Univision restructured the station to fit Arbitron's new ratings methodology. The station, now re-branded as MIX 98.3, assumed a more bilingual style programing.\n\nJoe Ferrero was let go by Univision Radio on June 4, 2010 along with (Mike Reyes) Mikey Machete. In October 2010 Joe Ferrero consequently took over \"El Vacilón de la Mañana\" on Spanish Broadcasting System's (WXDJ) El Zol 95.7 FM with new co-host Albertito Rodriguez as his sidekick and female co-host Betzy Vazquez. Mikey (Mike Reyes) Machete is currently the Promotions & Marketing director for ESPN Deportes Radio in Miami.\n\nAs of August 22, 2012, Joe Ferrero is no longer at SBS Miami. He was let go for no apparent reason and is currently the Operations Manager and morning show host at the all new 105.5 FM stations out of the Florida Keys. Some of the infamous duo's classic crank calls can still be heard on www.Marikonson.com\nIn 2015, Ferrero became a morning host on WMGE (Mega 94.9) in the Miami/Frt Lauderdale market until 2016, when Joe Ferrero was let go from the station \"for no apparent reason\" as per the statement he released via his Instagram account.\n\n\"El Vacilón de la Mañana\" (roughly translated as the \"Morning Party\") has various key elements: prank calls, musical parodies, comedy sketches, humorous commentary about straight and odd news, and open telephone lines.\n\nThe program's key player is Luis Jiménez (born on March 26, 1970 in San Juan, Puerto Rico), who has been its main host for more than twelve years. Jiménez co-hosts the broadcast with Raymond Broussard (born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on December 20, 1953, of Cajun and Puerto Rican descent) and who uses the stage name \"Moonshadow\".\n\nLuis Jiménez started his radio career in his hometown of Caguas, Puerto Rico as a teenager, working as a part-time disc-jockey in various local radio stations. He later moved to Orlando, Florida, achieving some recognition there as a morning radio host after holding various odd jobs. He was referred to La Mega's management as a suitable candidate for hosting a Spanish-language radio show in New York City and moved there in 1993. The program's first airing occurred on August 9.\n\nJiménez modeled his show after \"El Bufeo Matutino\" (\"The Morning Goof\"), a successful radio program in Puerto Rico that lasted twenty-two years in its various inceptions, and always had Moonshadow as its main producer and host. Luis Jiménez co-hosted the show with longtime friend Junior Hernandez. Hernandez suffered from asthma, and died of a heart attack. Fans streamed to the station to pay tribute to Hernandez the Thursday night after his death; the popular radio personality was only 34 years old. After Broussard's move to New York City in 1997, and after the death of Hernandez's in 1998, the program had a succession of co-hosts, with Moonshadow joining the show for good in 2000. Moonshadow can claim poetic justice about the fact that WZNT-FM, also known as Z-93, (Puerto Rico's main salsa radio station), which was the same radio station who fired him for being too controversial, now airs \"El Vacilón de la Mañana\" to Puerto Rico in direct Internet audio feed from La Mega every morning after a management change (SBS currently owns both stations). The first audio feed to Puerto Rico occurred on February 9, 2004. The program has since gone into syndication by ABC Networks in a few Latino markets within the United States; the first syndicated airing to Orlando, Florida and other Latino markets occurred on January 9, 2006.\nWhile Moonshadow has gone on record in numerous times about modeling his original show after Howard Stern's (with a very strong dose of Puerto Rican cultural elements), Jiménez's numerous original contributions give the show a unique pan-Latino flavor (its largest audience appears to be the Dominican and Puerto Rican community in New York City). The result \"out-Sterned\" Stern's show, and El Vacilón's audienceship ratings surpassed Stern's for three years, until Stern's departure to satellite radio in 2005.\n\nJiménez and Moonshadow do not act alone: besides a sizeable audience participation, the show's announcers and assistant producers (called the \"Mequetrefes\", or Whippersnappers) are key to the success of the show. This ragtag group feature a female traffic announcer (Carolina Cadillo, born in Newark, New Jersey, of Peruvian and Nicaraguan descent), a rather peculiar news announcer (Francis Méndez, born in Jarabacoa, Dominican Republic), the show's main audio producer (DJ Chucky), its call screeners and production assistants (Tony Sánchez, Bocachula, El Papichulo, etc.), and the like. The show's executive producer, María Eugenia Alma, appears sporadically in the show, particularly as female singer and occasional phone call prankster.\n\nEach member of the team is known for a perceived self-avowed defect or particularity: Luis Jiménez claims to have undersized genitalia and hypospadias, Moonshadow has an inguinal hernia but reportedly has the fastest tongue in American radio history; Francis Méndez is allegedly a former cocaine addict who now suffers from erectile dysfunction as a result, Carolina Cadillo is a proud nymphomaniac who speaks Spanish with a noticeable English accent (Spanish is her second language) and who has virtually no buttocks, and so on.\n\nPrank calls are usually presented in a section called \"¡Caíste!\" (You Fell for It!), in which unwitting people are called to their homes or job places and are provoked with touchy subjects for the prank victims (generally, they are taunted with intimate subjects). These prank calls are made by request from friends or family of the victims. The most famous prank call victim on the show's history was a Dominican building superintendent given the moniker Manolo Cabeza 'e Huevo by Jiménez, who played the part of a viciously irate jealous husband. Manolo's enraged, expletive-laden response has become the most copied and broadcast anecdote in the show's history. Manolo's son Israel, who coordinated the phone call, was in turn pranked in another memorable call.\n\nAfter the deportation of the section's producer, Rubén Ithier, also known as \"Rubén El Moreno\", back to his country of origin, the Dominican Republic in late 2004, this section went into limbo for close to a year and a half. Prank reruns were (and are still) played on the section's regularly slotted time.\n\nDuring the hiatus, the current cast tried to pull some pranks of their own with mixed success, including repeated \"Manolo Cabeza 'e Huevo\" pranks, perhaps the most successful after Ithier's departure.\n\nThe cast resumed production of regularly scheduled \"¡Caíste!\" pranks in early 2006.\n\nIn a similar sidenote, the Miami programme is also known for its share of pranks. Its notoriety came with the \"¡Caiste!\" jokes made to Hugo Chávez and Fidel Castro (The former being pranked before the latter) while using pre-existing tape conversations (for the former, it was with a conversation between Castro and then-Mexican President Vicente Fox, while for the latter, the snippets of the prank which was done on Chávez was used). Both pranks had Joe Ferrero pretending to be a sergeant in some army. Needless to say, while the reaction of the former victim was absolute silence, Castro replied after Ferrero tripped up his (Castro's) words (\"¿Estás conforme con toda la mierda que has hecho en la isla, asesino?\" [\"Are you conformed with all the shit that you did on the island, murderer?\"]) with a slightly peeved response: \"¿En qué caí, comemierda? ¿En qué caí, maricón? ¿En qué caí, mari-cón-són?\" (\"What did I fall in, shiteater? What did I fall in, queer? What did I fall in, you gay-fer?\"). However, the FCC complained and slapped a fine to the two disc jockeys (Enrique Santos and Joe Ferrero); both chose not to pay, relying instead on a penny-drive. Its (the programme's) second-funniest joke is one that is called \"¡Píntame!\" (Paint me!), in which the two prank call a painter by asking him \"¿Usted es el pintor?\" (\"Are you the Painter?\"), whereupon by using his response (which was always \"¡Sí, yo soy el pintor!\" (\"Yes, I'm the painter!\") they played a sample of Elvis Crespo's song \"Píntame\" (the first line of the song, to be exact: \"'Píntame', le dije yo al pintor\"; \"'Paint me', I told the painter\"), thus aggravating the man and angering him even further, thus launching a tirade of Dominican insults. Another famous prank made by the 2 DJs was their \"Gonzalo Créo\" saga; the first joke of which, \"La vieja puta\" (\"The Old Bitch\"), revolved around Santos prank calling a Cuban man by making said Cuban believe that he was in a telephoned confession booth, whereupon the Cuban said that he was being stalked by the grandmother of a friend of his. When one of Santos's associates is heard, the Cuban is outraged, and hangs up on him, whereupon, we hear Santos saying that he didn't get a chance to ask for the Cuban's money; the rest of the prank (although it is funny) revolves around then trying to get the Cuban's money. More of the \"Gonzalo Créo\" jokes occurred, including \"El Dolor del Vecino\" (The Neighbor's Pain), using the same premise of pretense of a telephoned confession booth, which involves a man struggling with his apparent bisexuality and \"Domingo Y Pancho\" which involves them prank calling a man who is sexually aroused by a woman who is helping him with physical therapy for an illness of the nerves. A lot of the prank calls made by Enrique Santos and Joe Ferrero (During and after \"El Vacilón\" including the Enrique & Joe Show) have now been made available at www.Marikonson.com\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission considers the use of prank calls to be a violation of FCC policy, which prohibits recording unsolicited phone calls for broadcast, and fined WSKQ a penalty of $16,000 for a 2007 prank call, unless all parties agree with the recording being made public.\n\nLuis Jiménez (and occasionally Moonshadow, who used to play all the comedic characters in his previous shows but has a more laid-back role on this one) play various characters in fifteen-minute segments on the show (usually three a day). Among them: \"Cornelio Toro\", a naive store-owner whose wife has made a habit of being unfaithful to him with every man she comes in contact with while Toro fails to recognize it every time, even though he immediately knows when someone else is being cheated on (the name is a play on Spanish words: Cornelio sounds very much like \"cuernudo\", a cuckold, while Toro, or bull, evokes the bull's \"cuernos\", or horns, the sign of the deceived man in Latin American culture); \"Jonathan Buford Rodriguez\", better known as \"El Chulo\", a gigolo who preys on geriatric women; \"El Chef Pipí\", a parody on Cuban chef and Univision television personality José Hernández, better known as Chef Pepin, being Chef Pipí's main trait his questionable masculinity; \"Rebeca Larica\", a hyperventilating, gum-chewing woman who craves for male attention (played by Moonshadow); \"Dr. Héctor Tilla\", a self-proclaimed medical doctor with very rude manners and a long history of malpractice lawsuits; \"Paca Garmentí\" and \"Silvia Penacho Chafrías\"; two civic-minded single women (they are set apart, in the movie at least, by their hairstyle: Paca, played by Luis, has short black hair in braids, while Silvia, played by Moonshadow, has red hair styled similarly to the Wendy's girl), both over 60 years old, who love to bicker with each other (both names are plays on Spanish words: \"\"Pa' cagarme en tí\"\" is the informal way of saying \"\"En tí me' cago\"\", which means \"I shit on you\", while Silvia's name, whilst parts of it are normal, The clang comes with the word \"\"chocha fría\"\", which means something to the effect of \"cold pussy\"); \"Madam Melo\" (originally called \"Mamá Melo\"), a hyperkinetic Dominican santería practitioner (both names are plays on sexual references: \"Madam Melo\" is a play on \"mandamelo\", which means \"Fuck me\", whilst \"Mamá Melo\" is a play on the insult \"mamamelo\", which means \"Suck it (my dick) for me\"); \"Goyito\" and \"Memin\", two schoolkids (Memin being a straight arrow, while Goyito is a perennial foul-mouthed prankster) and \"Federico \"Pedrito\" Rivera Rodriguez\", better known as \"Findingo\", a chronic marijuana smoker with a strong speech impairment.\n\nSome of the ideas behind these characters are not entirely original: \"Cornelio Toro\" is the updated version of \"Toribio Tauro\", a similar television character played by Puerto Rican comedic actor Adrián García on Puerto Rican television (and provided with an accent closely resembling that of \"Don Pulula\", one of José Miguel Agrelot's characters); \"El Chulo\" evolved from a real human being who was a production assistant for one of Puerto Rico's radio morning shows who had a liking for geriatric women (and became famously made fun of by being called \"El Chupaviejas\" by the show's hosts), and \"Dr. Hector Tilla\" was another one of Moonshadow's creations while in the toilet. \"Goyito\" and \"Memin\" were originally created by Moonshadow after \"Pellín\" and \"Pillín\", two animated characters from a Puerto Rican public service announcement, while \"Findingo's\" name was taken from a similarly named (although completely different) comedic character played by the Puerto Rican actor, René Rubiella; the original character shared a low intelligence quotient with the newer one, besides the name. The parody on Chef Pepin was rumored to be hated by the parodied celebrity because of its homoerotic undertones, but this was dispelled recently when Chef Pepín himself was invited to participate in a racy sketch along its comedic counterpart, the result being a hilarious interaction between the two characters which Chef Pepín clearly enjoyed.\n\nSpecial mention has to be made about a real \"character\" who happens to be a regular caller to the show, and as of October 2005 has joined the cast on a part-time basis. \"Metadona\" is a real-life reformed robber, born in Ponce, Puerto Rico, who had a chronic drug addiction before rehabilitation. There are strong doubts about him being completely drug-free, but he vows to have abandoned his criminal past for good. His slow delivery (evoking a chronically drug-induced state) and daring stories about botched robberies and juvenile pranks entitled him to the alias, which is the Spanish word for methadone. He has a habit of loudly opening a beer can for breakfast every time he calls.\n\n\"El Vacilón\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s musical parodies have recently become the show's bread and butter. Popular Latino songs are typically parodied in the show, generally changing the lyrics to sexually suggestive, humorous lyrics. Some original compositions are featured as well, and generally along the same subject matter. A few program guests, mainly reggaeton artists, have parodied their own regular songs in the show (and therefore have contributed with their own material). A few English-language songs are also parodied, but mostly fragments of them.\n\nNewer songs are introduced in a weekly section called \"El Joyón Musical\" (\"joyón\" can be an augmentative for either the word \"joya\" (jewel), or \"joyo\" (an alternate spelling for hole, and Puerto Rican vulgar slang for anus)). The songs are then placed in heavy rotation as filler between sections (and, in the Puerto Rico broadcast of the show, to cover local New York radio spots that are irrelevant to the Puerto Rican market).\n\nSome listeners have complained these musical parodies take more show time than warranted.

The rebels' position was that they had submitted to Muhammad as the prophet of Allah, but owed nothing to Abu Bakr. \n\nSome rebels followed either Tulayha, Musaylima or Sajjah, all of whom claimed prophethood. Most of the tribes were defeated and reintegrated into the Caliphate. The peoples surrounding Mecca did not revolt.\n\nA detailed reconstruction of the events is complicated by the frequently contradictory and tendentious accounts found in primary sources.\n\nIn about the middle of May 632, Muhammad, now ailing, ordered a large expedition to be prepared against the Byzantine Empire in order to avenge the martyrs of the battle of Mu'tah. 3000 Muslims were to join it. Usama ibn Zaid, a young man and son of Zayd ibn Harithah who was killed in the battle at Mu'tah, was appointed as commander of this force so he could avenge the death of his father. However, Muhammad died in June 632 and Abu Bakr was made the Caliph by a \"shura\" council in Saqifah.\n\nOn the first day of his caliphate, Abu Bakr ordered the army of Usama to prepare for march. Abu Bakr was under great pressure regarding this expedition due to rising rebellion and apostasy across Arabia, but he was determined. Before his march, Usama sent Umar to Abu Bakr and is reported to have said:However, Abu Bakr refused. He was moved to this decision at least partially by his desire to carry out the unfulfilled military plan of Muhammad.\n\nOn June 26, 632, the army of Usama broke camp and moved out. After leaving Medina, Usama had marched to Tabuk. Most of the tribes in this region opposed him fiercely, but he defeated them. Usama raided far and wide in the region of Northern Arabia, starting with the Quza'a, and then made his way to Dawmatu l-Jandal (modern Al Jawf, Saudi Arabia).\n\nAs a direct result of his operations, several rebel tribes resubmitted to Medinian rule and claimed that they re-accepted Islam. The Quza'a remained rebellious and unrepentant, but 'Amr ibn al-'As later attacked them and forced them to surrender again.\n\nUsama next marched to Mu'tah, attacked the Christian Arabs of the tribes of Banu Kalb and the Ghassanids in a small battle. Then he returned to Medina, bringing with him a large number of captives and a considerable amount of wealth, part of which comprised the spoils of war and part taxation of the re-conquered tribes. The Islamic army remained out of Medina for 40 days.\n\nThe concentrations of rebels nearest Medina were located in two areas: Abraq, 72 miles to the north-east, and Dhu Qissa, 24 miles to the east. These concentrations consisted of the tribes of Banu Ghatafan, the Hawazin, and the Tayy. Abu Bakr sent envoys to all the enemy tribes, calling upon them to remain loyal to Islam and continue to pay their Zakat.\n\nA week or two after the departure of Usama's army, the rebel tribes surrounded Medina, knowing that there were few fighting forces in the city. Meanwhile, Tulayha, a self-proclaimed prophet, reinforced the rebels at Dhu Qissa. In the third week of July 632, the apostate army moved from Dhu Qissa to Dhu Hussa, from where they prepared to launch an attack on Medina.\n\nAbu Bakr received intelligence of the rebel movements, and immediately prepared for the defense of Medina. As Usama's army was elsewhere, Abu Bakr scraped together a fighting force mainly from the clan of Mohammad, the Banu Hashim. The army had stalwarts like Talha ibn Ubaidullah and Zubair ibn al-Awam, who would later (in the 640s) conquer Egypt. Each of them was appointed commander of one-third of the newly organised force. Before the apostates could do anything, Abu Bakr launched his army against their outposts and drove them back to Dhu Hussa.\n\nThe following day, Abu Bakr marched from Medina with the main army and moved towards Dhu Hussa. As the riding camels were all with Usama's army, he could only muster inferior pack camels as mounts. These pack camels, being untrained for battle, bolted when Hibal, the apostate commander at Zhu Hussa, made a surprise attack from the hills; as a result, the Muslims retreated to Medina, and the apostates recaptured the outposts that they lost a few days earlier. At Medina, Abu Bakr reorganised the army for battle and attacked the apostates during the night, taking them by surprise. The apostates retreated from Dhu Hussa to Dhu Qissa. The following morning, Abu Bakr led his forces to Dhu Qissa, and defeated the rebel tribes, capturing Dhu Qissa on 1 August 632.\n\nThe defeated apostate tribes retreated to Abraq, where more clansmen of the Ghatfan, the Hawazin, and the Tayy were gathered. Abu Bakr left a residual force under the command of An-Numan ibn Muqarrin at Dhu Qissa and returned with his main army to Medina.\n\nOn 4 August 632, Usama's army returned to Medina. Abu Bakr ordered Usama to rest and resupply his men there for future operations. Meanwhile, in the second week of August 632, Abu Bakr moved his army to Zhu Qissa. Merging An-Numan ibn Muqarrin's remaining forces with his own, Abu Bakr then moved to Abraq, where the retreated rebels had gathered, and defeated them. The remaining rebels retreated to Buzakha, where Tulayha had moved with his army from Samira.\n\nIn the fourth week of August 632, Abu Bakr moved to Zhu Qissa with all available fighting forces. There he planned his strategy, in what would later be called the Campaign of Apostasy, to deal with the various enemies who occupied the rest of Arabia. The battles which he had fought recently against the apostate concentrations at Zhu Qissa and Abraq were in the nature of defensive actions to protect Medina and discourage further offensives by the enemy. These actions enabled Abu Bakr to secure a base from which he could fight the major campaign that lay ahead, thus gaining time for the preparation and launching of his main forces.\n\nAbu Bakr had to fight not one but several enemies: Tulayha at Buzakha, Malik bin Nuwaira at Butah, and Musaylima at Yamamah. He had to deal with widespread apostasy on the eastern and southern coasts of Arabia: in Bahrain, in Oman, in Mahra, in Hadhramaut and in Yemen. There was apostasy in the region south and east of Mecca and by the Quza'a in northern Arabia.\n\nAbu Bakr formed the army into several corps, the strongest of which was commanded by Khalid ibn Walid and assigned to fight the most powerful of the rebel forces. Other corps were given areas of secondary importance in which to subdue the less dangerous apostate tribes, and were dispatched after Khalid, according to the outcome of his operations. Abu Bakr's plan was first to clear west-central Arabia (the area nearest to Medina), then tackle Malik bin Nuwaira, and finally concentrate against the most dangerous and powerful enemy: the self-proclaimed prophet Musaylima.\n\nThe caliph distributed the available manpower among 11 main corps, each under its own commander, and bearing its own standard. The available manpower was distributed among these corps, and while some commanders were given immediate missions, others were given missions to be launched later. The commanders and their assigned objectives were:\n\n\nAs soon as the organisation of the corps was complete, Khalid marched off, to be followed a little later by Ikrimah and 'Amr ibn al-'As. The other corps were held back by the caliph and dispatched weeks and even months later, according to the progress of Khalid's operations against the hard core of enemy opposition.\n\nBefore the various corps left Zhu Qissa, however, envoys were sent by Abu Bakr to all apostate tribes in a final attempt to induce them to submit.\n\nApostasy and rebellion in central Arabia was led by Musaylima, a self-proclaimed prophet, in the fertile region of Yamamah. He was mainly supported by the powerful tribe of Banu Hanifa. At Buzakha in north central Arabia, another self-proclaimed prophet, Tulayha, a tribal chief of Banu Asad, led the rebellion against Medina aided by the allied tribes of Banu Ghatafan, the Hawazin, and the Tayy. At Najd, Malik ibn Nuweira led the tribes of Banu Tamim against the authority of Medina.\n\nOn receiving intelligence of the Muslim preparations, Tulayha too prepared for battle, and was further reinforced by the contingents of the allied tribes.\n\nBefore dispatching Khalid against Tulayha, Abu Bakr sought to reduce the latter's strength. Nothing could be done about the tribes of Bani Assad and Banu Ghatafan, which stood solidly behind Tulayha, but the Tayy were not so staunch in their support of Tulayha, and their chief, Adi ibn Hatim, was a devout Muslim.\n\nAdi was appointed by Abu Bakr to negotiate with the tribal elders to withdraw their contingent from Tulayha's army. The negotiations were a success, and Adi brought with him 500 horsemen of his tribe to reinforce Khalid's army.\n\nKhalid next marched against another apostate tribe, Jadila. Here again Adi ibn Hatim offered his services to persuade the tribe to submit without bloodshed. Bani Jadila submitted, and their 1000 warriors joined Khalid's army.\n\nKhalid, now much stronger than when he had left Zhu Qissa, marched for Buzakha. There, in mid-September 632 CE, he defeated Tulayha in the Battle of Buzakha. The remnants of Tulayha's army retreated to Ghamra, 20 miles from Buzakha, and were defeated in the Battle of Ghamra in the third week of September.\n\nSeveral tribes submitted to the Caliph after Khalid's decisive victories. Moving south from Buzakha, Khalid reached Naqra in October, with an army now 6000 strong, and defeated the rebel tribe of Banu Saleem in the Battle of Naqra. In the third week of October, Khalid defeated a tribal chieftess, Salma, in the battle of Zafar. Afterwards he moved to Najd against the rebel tribe of Banu Tamim and their Sheikh Malik ibn Nuwayrah.\n\nAt Najd, on learning of Khalid's decisive victories against apostates in Buzakha, many clans of Banu Tamim hastened to visit Khalid, but the Bani Yarbu', a branch of Bani Tamim, under their chief, Malik ibn Nuwayrah, hung back. Malik was a chief of some distinction: a warrior, noted for his generosity, and a famous poet. Bravery, generosity, and poetry were the three qualities most admired among the Arabs.\n\nAt the time of Muhammad, he had been appointed as a tax collector for the tribe of Banu Tamim. As soon as Malik heard of the death of Muhammad, he gave back all the tax to his tribespeople, saying, \"Now you are the owner of your wealth.\" Most scholars agreed that he was adhering to the normal beliefs of the Arabs of his time in which they could cease to pledge their allegiance to a tribe upon the death of its Sheikh.\n\nHis riders were stopped by Khalid's army at the town of Buttah. Khalid asked them about the pact they signed with the self-proclaimed prophetess Sajjah; they responded it was merely for revenge against their enemies.\n\nWhen Khalid reached Najd he found no opposing army. He sent his cavalry to nearby villages and ordered them to call the Azaan (call to prayer) to each party they met. Zirrar bin Azwar, a squadron leader, arrested the family of Malik, claiming they did not answer the call to prayer.\nMalik avoided direct contact with Khalid's army and ordered his followers to scatter, and he and his family apparently moved away across the desert. He refused to give zakat, differentiating between prayer and zakat.\n\nNevertheless, Malik was accused of rebellion against the state of Medina. He was also to be charged for his entering into the alliance with Sajjah against the Caliphate. Malik was arrested along with those of his clan.\n\nMalik was asked by Khalid about his crimes, and responded, \"your master said this, your master said that\", referring to Abu Bakr. Khalid declared Malik a rebel apostate and ordered his execution.\n\nIkrimah ibn Abi-Jahl, one of the corps commanders, was instructed to make contact with Musaylima at Yamamah, but not to engage until Khalid joined him. Abu Bakr's intention in giving Ikrimah this mission was to tie Musaylima down at Yamamah, thereby freeing Khalid to deal with the apostate tribes of north-central Arabia without interference.\n\nMeanwhile, Abu Bakr sent Shurhabil's corps to reinforce Ikrimah at Yamamah. Ikrimah, however, in early September 632, attacked Musaylima's forces before the reinforcements arrived, and was defeated. He reported his actions to Abu Bakr, who, both pained and angered by the rashness of Ikrimah and his disobedience, ordered him to proceed with his force to Oman to assist Hudaifa; once Hudaifa had completed his task, he was to march to Mahra to help Arfaja, and thereafter go to Yemen to help Muhajir.\n\nMeanwhile, Abu Bakr sent orders to Khalid to march against Musaylima. Shurhabil's corps, stationed at Yamamah, was to reinforce Khalid's corps. In addition to this Abu Bakr assembled a fresh army of Ansar and Muhajireen in Medina that joined Khalid's corps at Butah before the combined force set out for Yamamah.\n\nThough Abu Bakr had instructed Shurhabil not to engage Musaylima's forces until Khalid's arrival, Shurhabil engaged Musaylima's forces anyway and was defeated, too. Khalid linked up with the remnants of Shurhabil's corps early in December 632.\n\nThe combined force of Muslims, now 13,000 strong, finally defeated Musaylima's army in the Battle of Yamama, which was fought in the third week of December. The fortified city of Yamamah surrendered peacefully later that week.\n\nKhalid established his headquarters at Yamamah, from which he despatched columns throughout the plain of Aqraba to subdue the region around Yamamah. Thereafter, all of central Arabia submitted to Medina.\n\nWhat remained of the apostasy in the less vital areas of Arabia was rooted out by the Muslims in a series of well-planned campaigns within five months.\n\nIn mid-September 632, Abu Bakr dispatched Hudaifa bin Mihsan's corps to tackle the apostasy in Oman, where the dominant tribe of Azd had revolted under their chief Laqeet bin Malik, known more commonly as \"Dhu'l-Taj\" (\"the Crowned One\"). According to some reports, he also claimed prophethood.\n\nHudaifa entered Oman, but not having sufficient strength to fight Dhu'l-Taj, he requested reinforcements from the Caliph, who sent Ikrimah from Yamamah to aid him in late September. The combined forces then defeated Dhu'l-Taj at a battle at Dibba, one of Dhu'l-Taj's strongholds, in November. Dhu'l-Taj himself was killed in the battle.\n\nHudaifa was appointed governor of Oman, and set about the re-establishment of law and order. Ikrimah, having no local administrative responsibility, used his corps to subdue the area around Daba, and, in a number of small actions, succeeded in breaking the resistance of those Azd who had continued to defy the authority of Medina.\n\nSome time in October 632, Amr's corps was dispatched to the Syrian border to subdue the apostate tribes—most importantly, the Quza'a and the Wadi'a (a part of the Bani Kalb)--in the region around Tabuk and Daumat-ul-Jandal (Al-Jawf). Amr was not able to beat the tribes into submission until Shurhabil joined him in January after the Battle of Yamamah.\n\nThe Yemen had been the first province to rebel against the authority of Islam when the tribe of Ans rose in arms under the leadership of its chief and self-proclaimed prophet Al-Aswad Al-Ansi, the Black One. Yemen was controlled then by Al-Abna', a group descended from the Sasanian Persian garrison in Sanaa. When Badhan died, his son Shahr partially became governor of Yemen but was killed by Al-Aswad. Al-Aswad was later killed by Fayruz al-Daylami, also an abna' member, who was sent by Muhammad, and thereafter Fairoz acted as governor of Yemen at San'a.\n\nWhen word arrived that Mohammad had died, the people of the Yemen again revolted, this time under the leadership of a man named Ghayth ibn Abd Yaghuth. The avowed aim of the apostates was to drive the Muslims out of the Yemen by assassinating Fairoz and other important Muslim leaders. Fairoz somehow escaped and took shelter in the mountains in June or July 632. For the next six months Fairoz remained in his stronghold, during which time he was joined by thousands of Yemeni Muslims.\n\nWhen he felt strong enough, Fairoz marched to San'a and defeated Qais, who retreated with his remaining men northeast to Abyan, where they all surrendered and were subsequently pardoned by the caliph.\n\nFrom Oman, following the orders of Abu Bakr, Ikrimah marched to Mahra to join Arfaja bin Harthama. As Arfaja had not yet arrived, Ikrimah, instead of waiting for him, tackled the local rebels on his own.\n\nAt Jairut, Ikrimah met two rebel armies preparing for battle. Here he persuaded the weaker to embrace Islam and then joined up with them to defeat their opponents.\nHaving re-established Islam in Mahra, Ikrimah moved his corps to Abyan, where he rested his men and awaited further developments.\n\nAfter the Battle of Yamamah, Abu Bakr sent Ala bin Al Hadhrami's corps against the rebels of Bahrain. Ala arrived in Bahrain to find the apostate forces gathered at Hajr and entrenched in a strong position. Ala mounted a surprise attack one night and captured the city. The rebels retreated to the coastal regions, where they made one more stand but were decisively defeated. Most of them surrendered and reverted to Islam. This operation was completed at about the end of January 633.\n\nThe last of the great revolts of the apostasy was that of the powerful tribe of Kindah, which inhabited the region of Najran, Hadhramaut, and eastern Yemen. They did not break into revolt until January 633.\nZiyad bin Lubaid, Muslim governor of Hadhramaut, operated against them and raided Riyaz, after which the whole of the Kindah broke into revolt under al-Ash'ath ibn Qays and prepared for war. However, the strength of the two forces, \"i.e.\" apostate and Muslim, was so well balanced that neither side felt able to start serious hostilities. Ziyad waited for reinforcements before attacking the rebels.\n\nReinforcements were on the way. al-Muhajir ibn Abi Umayya, the last of the corps commanders to be despatched by Abu Bakr, defeated some rebel tribes in Najran, south-eastern Arabia, and was directed by Abu Bakr to march to Hadhramaut and join Ziyad against the Kindah. The Caliph also instructed Ikrimah, who was at Abyan, to join Ziyad and Muhajir's forces.\n\nIn late January 633 the forces of Muhajir and Ziyad combined at Zafar, capital of Hadhramaut, under the overall command of the former, and defeated al-Ash'ath, who retreated to the fortified town of Nujair.\n\nJust after this battle the corps of Ikrimah also arrived. The three Muslim corps, under the overall command of Muhajir, advanced on Nujair and laid siege to the fortified city.\n\nNujair was captured some time in mid-February 633. With the defeat of the Kindah at Nujair the last of the great apostate movements collapsed. Arabia was safe for Islam.\n\nThe Campaign of the Apostasy was fought and completed during the 11th year of the Hijra. The year 12 Hijri dawned on March 18, 633, with Arabia united under the central authority of the Caliph at Medina. This campaign was Abu Bakr's greatest political and military triumph, and was a complete success.\n\nWith the collapse of the rebellions, Abu Bakr now decided to expand the empire. It is unclear whether his intention was to mount a full-scale expansion, or preemptive attacks to secure a buffer zone between the Islamic state and the powerful Sassanid and Byzantine empires. This set the stage for the Islamic conquest of Persia.\nKhalid was sent to the Persian Empire with an army consisting of 18,000 volunteers, and conquered the richest province of the Persian empire: Iraq. Thereafter, Abu Bakr sent his armies to invade Roman Syria, an important province of the Byzantine Empire.\n\nThe events were later regarded as primarily a religious movement by Arabic historians. However, the early sources indicate that in reality it was also an attempt to restore political control over the Arabian tribes. After all, the rebelling Arabs only refused to pay Zakat (charity), but they did not refuse to perform the salah. This, however, is disputed and explained by Sunni scholars such that the dictation of Zakat was one of the Five Pillars of Islam and its denial or withholding is an act of denial of a cornerstone of the faith, and is therefore an act of apostasy. Bernard Lewis states that the fact that Islamic historians have regarded this as a primarily religious movement was due to a later interpretation of events in terms of a theological world-view.\nThe opponents of the Muslim armies were not only apostates, but also tribes which were largely or even completely independent from the Muslim community.\nHowever, these revolts also had a religious aspect: Medina had become the centre of a new Arabian social and political system of which religion was an integral part; consequently it was inevitable that any reaction against this system should have a religious aspect.\n\nShia Muslims consider ridda wars as illegal and senseless campaign of violence by a tyrant that killed thousands of Muslims, including prominent ones such as Malik ibn Nuwayrah.\n\n\n\n"}

His work tended to be very decorative, much of it centered on depiction of young women set among flowers. He later became known for his murals and designs in stained glass.\n\nRobert Reid was born in Stockbridge, Massachusetts and attended the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston under Otto Grundmann, where he was later an instructor. In 1884 he moved to New York City, studying at the Art Students League, and in 1885 he went to Paris to study at the Académie Julian under Gustave Boulanger and Jules Joseph Lefebvre. His early pictures were figures of French peasants, painted at Étaples.\n\nUpon returning to New York in 1889, he worked as a portraitist and later became an instructor at the Art Students League and Cooper Union.\nHe painted three murals for the Manufactures Building at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and exhibited four paintings in its Fine Arts Building. His work, including the tragic \"Her First Born\" (1888), was awarded a medal for excellence. \n\nReid was a member of the Ten American Painters, who seceded from the Society of American Artists in 1897. His painting \"Dawn\" was awarded the 1898 First Hallgarten Prize by the National Academy of Design. \n\nReid worked on several mural projects around the turn of the century. When he returned to paintings, around 1905, his work was more naturalistic, and his palette tended toward soft pastels.\nReid's murals are in the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., and the Appellate Court House in New York City. The Rotunda of the Massachusetts State House in Boston contains his three large mural panels—\"James Otis Delivering his Speech against the Writs of Assistance\", \"Paul Revere's Ride\", and \"The Boston Tea Party\". He executed a mural panel for the American Pavilion at the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris.\n\nHis murals for the Palace of Fine Arts building at the Panama–Pacific International Exposition (San Francisco, 1915) were an extraordinary tribute to the Arts.\nEight huge panels graced the ceiling of the rotunda: \"The Four Golds of California\" (Golden Metal, Wheat, Citrus Fruits, and Poppies); \nplus \"Ideals in Art\", \"Inspirations of All Arts\", the \"Birth of European Art\" and \"Birth of Oriental Art\" These paintings no longer exist in San Francisco's Palace of Fine Arts, which was re-built in the 1960s, and their current whereabouts are unknown.\nIn 1906 Reid completed a series of ten stained glass windows depicting the \"Life of Christ\" for the Unitarian Memorial Church in Fairhaven, Massachusetts. For the Church of St. Paul the Apostle in New York City, he created \"The Martyrdom of St. Paul Window\", located at the southwestern end of the nave.\n\nThe National Academy of Design elected Reid an Associate member in 1904, and an Academician in 1906. \n\nReid also taught; among his pupils was Nan Sheets.\n\nReid died in Clifton Springs, New York.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2223277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2223277", "title": "Trespass to land", "text": "Trespass to land\n\nTrespass to land is a common law tort or crime that is committed when an individual or the object of an individual intentionally (or, in Australia, negligently) enters the land of another without a lawful excuse. Trespass to land is \"actionable per se\". Thus, the party whose land is entered upon may sue even if no actual harm is done. In some jurisdictions, this rule may also apply to entry upon public land having restricted access. A court may order payment of damages or an injunction to remedy the tort.\n\nBy law, trespass for mesne profits is a suit against someone who has been ejected from property that did not belong to them. The suit is for recovery of damages the trespasser caused to the property and for any profits he or she may have made while in possession of that property.\n\nFor a trespass to be actionable, the tortfeasor must voluntarily go to a specific location, but need not be aware that he entered the property of a particular person. If A forces B unwillingly onto C's land, C will not have action in trespass against B, because B's actions were involuntary. C may instead claim against A. Furthermore, if B is deceived by A as to the ownership or boundaries of C's land, A may be jointly liable with B for B's trespass.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, if a person were to accidentally enter onto private property, there would be no trespass, because the person did not intend any violation. However, in Australia, negligence may substitute the requirement for intent.\n\nIf a trespass is actionable and no action is taken within reasonable or prescribed time limits, the land owner may forever lose the right to seek a remedy, and may even forfeit certain property rights. \"See Adverse possession\" and Easement by prescription.\n\nTrespass may also arise upon the easement of one person upon the land of another. For example, if A grants B a right to pass freely across A's land, then A would trespass upon B's easement by erecting a locked gate or otherwise blocking B's rightful access.\n\nIn some jurisdictions trespass while in possession of a firearm, which may include a low-power air weapon without ammunition, constitutes a more grave crime of armed trespass.\n\nThe maxim \"cuius est solum, eius est usque ad coelum et ad infernos\" (whoever owns the land owns it all the way to heaven and to hell) is said to apply, however that has been limited by practical considerations. For example, aerial trespass is limited to airspace which might be used (therefore aeroplanes cannot be sued). Landowners may not put up structures to prevent this. The courts have been more lenient with underground trespass. The Kentucky Court of Appeal in Edwards v Sims (1929) 24 SW 2d 619 seems to affirm the maxim without qualification, whereas the New South Wales Supreme Court in Australia seemed more reluctant to do so in Di Napoli v New Beach Apartments (2004) Aust Torts Reports 81-728. There is therefore an asymmetry between aerial and underground trespass, which may be resolved by the fact the ground is almost always used (to support buildings and other structures) whereas airspace loses its practical use above the height of skyscrapers.\n\nThere may be regulations that hold a trespasser to a higher duty of care, such as strict liability for timber trespass (removing trees beyond a permitted boundary), which is a type of trespass to chattels as a result of a trespass to land.\n\nSome cases also provide remedies for trespass not amounting to personal presence, as where an object is intentionally deposited, or farm animals are permitted to wander upon the land of another. Furthermore, if a new use of nearby land interferes with a land owner's quiet enjoyment of his rights, there may be an action for nuisance, as where a disagreeable aroma or noise from A drifts across the land of B.\n\nTrespass ab initio is when a person is granted access to land but then abuses that access. The entry to the land is considered to have been a trespass from the beginning. This only applies to access given by law, not to access given by a person (as established by the Six Carpenters' Case).\n\nIn English law, trespass to land involves the \"unjustifiable interference with land which is in the immediate and exclusive possession of another\". Land is defined as the surface, subsoil, airspace and anything permanently attached to the land, such as houses. It is not necessary to prove that harm was suffered to bring a claim, and is instead actionable \"per se\". While most trespasses to land are intentional, it can also be committed negligently. Accidental trespass also incurs liability, with an exception for entering land adjoining a road unintentionally (such as in a car accident). Although previously a pure tort, the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 created some circumstances in which trespass to land can also be a crime.\n\nTrespass is an offence under Scots Law; however, the legislation was amended under the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 which established universal access rights to most land and inland water. These reforms do not apply (hence trespass remains an offence) to:\n\nIn most states, a criminal trespass to land is defined by statute and constitutes a misdemeanor. In some states, it may be a felony under certain circumstances (e.g., trespassing on a research facility or school property). Remedies between private parties for trespass may include an injunction or money damages.\n\n"}

The airport was located five kilometers northwest of downtown Iloilo City in the district of Mandurriao. It was the fourth-busiest airport overall and the busiest domestic airport in the Philippines, accommodating over 700,000 passengers and over 5,000 tons of cargo in 2005. During the construction of the new Iloilo International Airport, it was also known as Iloilo-Mandurriao Airport.\n\nHaving been in service since the 1930s, Mandurriao Airport has since been replaced by the Iloilo-Cabatuan/Santa Barbara International Airport, and subsequently decommissioned on June 14, 2007. A sprawling business district, known as Iloilo Business Park occupies the airport site.\n\nMandurriao Airport was built in 1937 and also served as a World War II airfield. The year 1981 saw the arrival of Pope John Paul II to the province of Iloilo as one of his stops during his 1981 Philippines visit, with the airport being used to facilitate his landing. The new passenger terminal was built in 1982.\n\nHowever, in the 1990s, problems in Mandurriao Airport began to rise due to the liberalization of the Philippine aviation industry and the rise of air travel in the country. The increasing incidents of terrorism in the Philippines forced aviation officials to restrict airport access only to passengers, the sealing of doors and windows at airport terminals being an essential component thereof. The terminal's architecture had posed problems for passengers, causing six to thirty three air-conditioning units to be installed but another barrage of problems hit the airport, which included outdated facilities, more poor passenger comfort, and others. Passenger complaints also focused on having their baggage manually checked due to the updated machines being for the sole use of Philippine Airlines. The airport complex likewise was located directly alongside major city thoroughfares, in particular the city's main highway, the Tomás Confesor Highway, which complicated the flow of traffic in and around the area.\n\nBy 1995, Iloilo's provincial government and the Philippine National Government have agreed to a proposal of building a new airport outside of the city, selecting Cabatuan as the new airport site. The last flights served by the airport happened on June 13, 2007, prior to the opening of the current Iloilo International Airport.\n\nUnder Executive Order 282, an Asset Disposition Program was created to study the method of privatization of the property. Executive Order 360 devolved the chairmanship of this program to the Department of Finance.\n\nThe Old Iloilo Airport property in Manduriao was scheduled for privatization by the first half of 2007. The city government views the successful privatization of this property as key to the revitalization of Iloilo City.\n\nAs of 3 April 2007, 5 large Philippine real estate developers pre-qualified as bidders of the airport. These are Ayala Land, Empire East, Robinsons Land, Rockwell Land, and SM Prime. The Privatization Council set the minimum price for the 54 hectare property at P1.2 billion (P2,200 per square meter).\n\nThe bidding for the Manduriao Airport was conducted on 9 May 2007. Among the pre-qualified bidders, only Robinsons Land, Empire East, and SM Prime Participated. The following table shows their respective bids:\n\nThe Old Iloilo Airport Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) declared a failed bidding because no bid went above the minimum price. Thereafter, the BAC decided to enter into a Negotiated Sale process. The 5 pre-qualified bidders were then invited to participate. However, a member of the Privatization Council was adamant in keeping the P1.2 billion minimum price.\n\nOnly Robinsons Land submitted a bid on the last day of the Negotiated Sale, 14 June 2007. It bid P908 million for the property. The BAC had no choice but to declare a failure on the Negotiated Sale. Unfortunately for the people of Iloilo and the local city government, some BAC members have no private sector experience and they do not see the logic behind RLC's lower bid. The BAC worked on lowering the minimum price of the property. However, some agencies have not consulted their principals on the minimum price that these principals are comfortable with.\n\nMonths after battling technicalities, the bidding pushed through. Megaworld acquired the 54-hectare old Iloilo Airport site for Php 1.2 billion (roughly $2.5 million) to be developed into a mixed-use residential and commercial complex.\n\nAs of 2016, the airport grounds have become Iloilo City's central business district, named as Iloilo Business Park and is now home to several luxury hotels, condominiums, and various call center companies. The APEC Finance meetings in 2015 was hosted in the Iloilo Convention Center, which occupies the former site of the airport terminal.\n\nThe former control tower of Mandurriao Airport is the airport's only surviving remnant and it serves as a monument to Iloilo's aviation history and Philippine aviation history. The structure also pays homage to Pope John Paul II, who used the airport on his Iloilo stop during his 1981 visit to the Philippines.\n\nThe destinations of Mandurriao Airport before its closure.\n\n"}

It was recorded in the summer of 1974 in Los Angeles, and released later that year. \"Goodnight Vienna\" followed the commercially successful predecessor \"Ringo\", and Starr used many of the same players, including Billy Preston, Klaus Voormann, Robbie Robertson, Harry Nilsson, and producer Richard Perry. The title is a Liverpool slang phrase meaning \"it's all over\".\n\nWhile all three other former Beatles had contributed to \"Ringo\" (1973), only John Lennon contributed to \"Goodnight Vienna\". \nOn 17 June 1974, Starr called Lennon, who was about to record his \"Walls and Bridges\" album, and asked him to write a song he could include on his next album. Lennon wrote what became the title track, \"Goodnight Vienna\". A demo of \"(It's All Down to) Goodnight Vienna\" was recorded by Lennon on 28 June, with the session musicians from \"Walls & Bridges\" and sent to Starr in advance of the sessions. Besides writing and playing piano on the title track, Lennon suggested Starr cover The Platters' hit \"Only You (And You Alone)\" playing acoustic guitar and providing a guide vocal for Starr to follow. Starr's versions of both \"Only You (And You Alone)\" and \"(It's All Down to) Goodnight Vienna\" were recorded at a session produced by Lennon. Elton John also contributed a track, \"Snookeroo\", co-written with Bernie Taupin. Harry Nilsson gave Starr the track \"Easy for Me\", which he later recorded his own version of for his \"Duit on Mon Dei\" album.\n\n\"Only You (And You Alone)\", backed with \"Call Me\", was issued as an advance single from the album in the US on 11 November 1974, before the album was released. In the US the song reached number 8 on the US charts. \"Goodnight Vienna\" was released on the same day as the \"Only You (And You Alone)\" single in the UK on 15 November. The album reached only number 30 in the UK, and would be Starr's last chart album in his homeland until 1998. The album was released in the US on 18 November, and peaked at number 8, ultimately going gold, and its reviews were generally favourable. It was also originally released in quadrophonic. A promo film for \"Only You (And You Alone)\" was aired on Top of the Pops on 19 December. On 27 January 1975, \"No No Song\", backed with \"Snookeroo\", was released in the US, reaching number 3. Nearly a month later, on 21 February, \"Snookeroo\" was released as a single in the UK, backed with \"Oo-Wee\".\n\nOn 2 June, a special edit of \"(It's All Down to) Goodnight Vienna\" and \"Goodnight Vienna (Reprise)\" was released as a single, backed with an edit of \"Oo-Wee\", in the US. The cover artwork for \"Goodnight Vienna\" was based on a still from the classic science fiction film \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\", with Starr's head replacing that of actor Michael Rennie. Rennie's character was the alien Klaatu. A television commercial, which featured a voiceover from Lennon, depicted the cover's flying saucer (with Starr) over Los Angeles—landing on the roof of the Capitol Records building in Hollywood. The commercial was produced by Vidtronics Company Inc. Starr returned the favour and did the voiceover for the commercial for Lennon's \"Walls and Bridges\" album. Immediately after filming the commercial, on 14 November 1974, the promo film for \"Only You (And You Alone)\" was filmed. During the video Starr and Nilsson mimed to the song, on top of the Capitol Records building. The video aired on BBC TV's \"Top of the Pops\" show, on 19 December.\n\n\"Goodnight Vienna\" was reissued in the US, this time by Capitol in February 1981. The album was remastered and reissued on CD on 30 November 1992 in the UK, and on 23 March 1993 in the US, with three bonus tracks: 1972 hit single \"Back Off Boogaloo\", its B-Side \"Blindman\" and an extended version of the McCartney-penned \"Six O'Clock\", a shorter version of which had earlier appeared on the LP version of \"Ringo\".\n\nFootnotes\nCitations\n"}

It is run by Canadian Centre for Civic Media and Arts Development Inc. broadcasting over FM on 105.5 MHz in Toronto, Ontario and has also served as a community radio station for the residents of the Jane and Finch corridor in North Toronto. CHRY's studios are located at York University's Student Centre, while its transmitter is located on top of the Vanier College residence building.\n\nCHRY was founded as a closed-circuit cable radio service, called Radio York, in 1965, and was located on the top floor of Vanier College and served campus residences and the cafeteria located at Central Square. On June 1, 1986, upon successful application to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for a broadcasting licence, began to broadcast as CHRY at 50W, with a transmitting antenna located on the top of Vanier College's residence building. As well, on this day, it became incorporated as CHRY Community Radio, Inc.\n\nIn 1997, it moved from its old Vanier College studios to the fourth floor of York University's Student Centre, where it is today. This move was financed by a $40,000 loan from the undergraduate student association, which was forgiven four years later.\nA limitation to CHRY was that its licence was Class B, which effectively meant that it was \"unprotected\" legally from claims of signal interference, effectively requiring it to cease operations if another broadcasting interest was affected in some way by CHRY's operation. However, in 2006, the CRTC accepted CHRY's application to reclassify its licence from \"Class B\" to \"Class A\", thus effecting \"protected status\" for the radio station.\n\nCHRY serves the north western part of Toronto. Prior to its relaunch in 2015, more than one-third of its schedule is devoted to the music and culture of the Caribbean. It employs two full-time staff, several other part-time staff, and is supported by the work of over one hundred volunteers from both York's student body and the surrounding community.\n\nOn May 1, 2015, CHRY cancelled all of its existing programs, dismissed all of its volunteers and rebranded itself as \"VIBE 105\", adopting an \"urban alternative\" format which it describes as \"a diverse and metropolitan blend of Cultural, Electronic and Remix programming\" which includes Electronic, Remix, Reggae, Soca, Afrobeat, Hip Hop and R&B. The station will also air talk programming. Volunteers are to be in supportive roles while on air talent will be professionalized in a departure from the station's long time commitment to community radio.\n\nThe dismissed programmers have been organizing community meetings and campaigning under the name #SAVECHRY in an effort to overturn the station's decision.\n\nIn 2016, the station applied for a license to add a nested FM repeater on 105.3 (with an average power of 92 watts, maximum of 155), with a transmitter located at 100 Wingarden Court in Scarborough (co-located with CJRK-FM). This was denied on June 16, 2017.\n\nCHRY is supported in part by student levy (contributions via the York University Graduate Students Association and York Federation of Students (YFS)), through occasional grants for which the station is eligible due to its charitable status, by York University through occasional workstudy grants, and by its listenership through pledges. The rest of its funding is from advertising revenue.\n\n\n"}

The book follows the early life of Henry Smart, from his childhood in the slums of early 20th century Dublin to his involvement in the Easter Rising and the Irish War of Independence.\n\nThe novel is set in Ireland in the era of political upheaval between the 1916 Easter Rising and the eventual truce signed with the United Kingdom in 1921, seen through the eyes of young Henry Smart, from his childhood to early twenties. Henry, as a member of the Irish Citizen Army, becomes personally acquainted with several historical characters, including Patrick Pearse, James Connolly and Michael Collins. Energized by Sinn Féin's victory in the General Election of 1918 and the party's establishment of the independent Irish Republic, Henry participates in the Soloheadbeg Ambush, the first engagement of the Irish War of Independence, as a lookout. \n\nLater, he becomes a gunman in the ensuing guerilla war against the British, setting barracks on fire, shooting G-men and training others to do the same. At the end of the novel, Henry comes to think that the endless violence and killing of innocent people has little to do with the concept of a free Ireland, or the prospect of a better life in Ireland and more about personal gain.\n\nOne cover to \"A Star Called Henry\" features a young member of the Irish Republican Army on patrol.

He served for a brief period as the fourth Prime Ministers of Saint Lucia following the resignation of John Compton. Lewis, a former director of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States, assumed the office of Prime Minister on April 2, 1996. He also served as Minister of Finance, Planning and Development, and Minister of External Affairs. In elections that followed on May 23, 1997, Lewis and the UWP suffered a huge setback, losing all but one of their seats in Parliament, forcing him to resign in favor of the leader of the Saint Lucia Labour Party, Dr. Kenny Anthony.\n\nCompton defeated Lewis for the UWP leadership in a party conference in Soufrière on March 13, 2005. Compton received 260 votes against 135 for Lewis.\n\nFollowing this defeat, Lewis resigned from the United Workers Party and joined the Saint Lucia Labour Party. On 7 September 2006, the executive of the Saint Lucia Labour Party endorsed Dr. Vaughan Lewis as its candidate for the Castries Central constituency in the December 2006 general election.\n\nLewis' defection to Labour was controversial. After losing two general elections in a row, Lewis had the opportunity to win the Castries Central seat in a February 2006 by-election. He then told UWP supporters first that he was the endorsed candidate. He then told them that he was taking time to make up his mind. Finally, he quit the UWP all together and said that he was no longer interested in electoral politics. However, Lewis had been in talks with high-ranking members of the Saint Lucia Labour Party about his defection since he was defeated by Compton in the leadership contest.\n\nMore troubling for Labour's top strategists was the fact that Lewis had brought Desmond Brathwaite into the party with him. Brathwaite is best known as the Women's Affairs Minister who was charged with kicking his wife down a flight of stairs in 1994. He was terribly unpopular but became so close to Lewis in 1996 that when asked why he didn't drop Brathwaite for political reasons, Lewis replied, \"I'd rather lose with Brathwaite than win without him.\" It led to the most crushing defeat in St Lucian political history. There were two other candidates, one of whom, then Senator Petra Nelson, subsequently left the Saint Lucia Labour Party to campaign for the United Workers Party in the 2006 General Elections.\n\nOn the face of it, Labour put up a good front, hailing Lewis, the same man they had previously ridiculed as an uncontrollable drunk in 1997, as a great Caribbean citizen and intellectual who was betrayed by Sir John Compton.\n\nLewis failed in his bid to win the Castries Central parliamentary seat from the UWP candidate Richard Frederick in the 2006 general elections held on December 11. Lewis returned to academia and was a Professor at the University of the West Indies, St Augustine Campus in Trinidad and Tobago. He has returned to St. Lucia occasionally to appear on the platform of the St Lucia Labour Party. He was chosen as part of a task force to explore the possibility of a union between Trinidad and Tobago and The Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States. After the St Lucia Labour Party government returned to office in 2011, Lewis became a special advisor in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n\nHe is married to lawyer Shirley Lewis, a Barbadian native who is currently the appointed Mayor of Castries. He is part of the prominent Lewis clan, son of St. Lucia's first Governor General, Sir Allen Lewis, and nephew of Sir Arthur Lewis, Nobel prize winner in economics.\n\nIn February 2016, to mark St Lucia Independence Day, he became one of the first knights of the Order of Saint Lucia, granting him the title of 'Sir'.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2223360", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2223360", "title": "Puri (food)", "text": "Puri (food)\n\nPuri (also spelled Poori) is a deep-fat fried bread made from unleavened whole-wheat flour that originated in the Indian subcontinent. It is eaten for breakfast or as a snack or light meal. It is usually served with a savory curry or \"bhaji\", as in puri bhaji, but may also be eaten with sweet dishes.\n\nPuris are most commonly served as breakfast and snacks. It is also served at special or ceremonial functions as part of ceremonial rituals along with other vegetarian food offered in prayer as prasadam.\n\nThe name \"puri\" derives from the Sanskrit word पूरिका (pūrikā), from पुर (pura) \"filled\". It has a similar name in many Asian languages including: Gujarati: પૂરી, (\"puri\"), (\"Purī\"), (\"pūḍī\"), (\"pūrī\"), (\"pūri\"), , (\"pūrī\"), (\"puri\"), (\"puri\"), (\"pūḍī\"), (\"pūri\"), (\"pūri\"), Georgian: პური (p'uri), (\"puri\")\n\nPuris are prepared with wheat flour, either atta (whole wheat flour) or sooji (coarse wheat flour) . In some recipes, ajwain, cumin seed, spinach, or fenugreek seeds are added to the dough. The dough is either rolled out in a small circle or rolled out and cut out in small circles, then deep fried in ghee or vegetable oil. While deep frying, puris puff up like a round ball because moisture in the dough changes into steam which expands in all directions. When they are golden-brown in color, they are removed and either served hot or saved for later use (as with the snack food pani puri). Rolled puris may be pricked with a fork before deep frying to make flat puris for chaat like bhel puri. A punctured puri does not puff when cooked because the steam escapes as it cooks.\n\nPuri can be eaten with many savory accompaniments, including korma, chana masala, dal, potato-based curries (for example, \"saagu\", \"bhaji\", \"bhujia\", \"Aloo ki tarkari\", \"shaak\", and \"sambharo\"), shrikhand and basundi. In some parts of India, puri is also served with a mixed vegetable dish that is prepared during Puja. Puri is also eaten with sweet accompaniments, such as kheer (a dessert prepared with rice, milk and sugar) or halwa (in Hindi-speaking regions of India, the expression \"Halwa puri khana\", \"to eat puri with halwa\", signifies a celebration – of possibly modest means). Puri is often the bread of choice for festivals and special occasions.\n\nIn the South of India, puri is almost always made for tiffin, and on the east coast (Andhra, Tamil Nadu) it's rarely eaten with non-vegetarian dishes. Often, they will be served with pickles, chutneys, dal masalas, potato masala, or gourd curry (either ivy, ridge, or bottle varieties).\n\nA variant of puri is bhatoora, which is three times the size of a puri and served with chholey (spicy chick peas). It often constitutes a full meal. (See chole bhature). Bhatoora bread is with yeast and puri bread made from unleavened dough.\n\nIn the Indian state of Odisha a large size puri is made during Bali Yatra which is called \"thunka puri\" ().\n\nAnother variant, largely popular in the Northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh is \"bedvi\". It is a saltier and stiffer version of the regular puri, and is often stuffed with lentils.\n\nAnother variant of the puri popular in the eastern states of West Bengal and Odisha is the luchi. In Assam, it is pronounced as \"lusi\". Luchis in Bengal are served with typical side dishes like aloor dum (potato preparation), begun bhaja (fried brinjal) and others\n\nThe \"puris\" used for \"panipuri\" are smaller, and are usually made crisper by the addition of \"rava/sooji\" (semolina) to the dough.\n\nSev puri is an Indian snack offered by street vendors who serve chaat.\n\nStreet vendors in Mumbai serve bhel in a throw-away folded leaf with a flat puri to scoop it.\n"}

He then worked for WBLS-FM as program director, taking that station to the top of the ratings during the late 1970s and pioneering the radio format now known as urban contemporary. He sometimes called himself the \"Chief Rocker\", and he was as well known for his boastful on-air patter as for his off-air flamboyance.\n\nWhen Studio 54 was at the height of its popularity, Crocker rode in through the front entrance on a white stallion. In the studio, before he left for the day, Crocker would light a candle and invite female listeners to enjoy a candlelight bath with him. He signed off the air each night to the tune \"Moody's Mood For Love\" by vocalese crooner King Pleasure. Crocker, a native of Buffalo, coined the phrase \"urban contemporary\" in the 1970s, a label for the eclectic mix of songs that he played.\n\nHe'd been the program director at WWRL-AM and felt held back by what he considered to be the narrow perspective of the station.\nHe quit and was twice re-hired by the station management; \"He knew how to attract attention,\" the chairman of Inner City Broadcasting, Hal Jackson was the owner of WBLS and once said, \"We called him Hollywood.\" \n\nBy 1979 he was shuttling between the west and east coast, with programming duties at KUTE in L.A. which featured R&B before a format change instituted there and on the east coast at WBLS which he called \"Disco and More\", relying on his expertise at \"finding the music\". Speaking to \"Radio Report\" magazine, an industry periodical, Crocker said, \"There is nothing I won't play if I hear it and like it and feel it will go for my market\".\n\nWBLS-FM broke Blondie, Madonna, Shannon, D Train, all Arthur Baker records, The System, Colonel Abrams, Alicia Myers and supermodel Grace Jones. He made, \"Love is the Message\" by MFSB NYC's unofficial anthem on the radio. WBLS airplay made \"Ain't No Stoppin Us Now\" by McFadden and Whitehead a favorite cookout, church, wedding and graduation song. \"The Magnificent Seven\" by the Clash became a hot song in the Black Community. He gave America exposure to an obscure genre called \"Reggae\" and a little known Jamaican rocker named Bob Marley. Fatback Band frontman Bill Curtis credited Crocker with breaking the group in New York.\n\nCrocker was the master of ceremonies of shows at the Apollo Theater in Harlem and was one of the first VJs on VH-1, the cable music video channel, in addition to hosting the TV series \"Solid Gold\" and NBC's \"Friday Night Videos\". As an actor, Crocker appeared in five films, including \"Cleopatra Jones\" (1973), \"Five on the Black Hand Side\" (1973), and \"Darktown Strutters (Get Down and Boogie)\" (1975).\n\nHe is credited with introducing as many as 30 new artists to the mainstream, including Manu Dibango's \"Soul Makossa\" to American audiences. While both Gary Byrd and Herb Hamlett were influenced by Crocker, it is only Hamlett who always attributes his success to his mentor in Buffalo, Frankie Crocker.\n\nFrankie Crocker was inducted into the Buffalo Broadcasting Hall of Fame in 2000 and the New York State Broadcasters Association Hall of Fame in 2005.\n\nCrocker was indicted in a 1976 payola investigation which was later overturned. After being charged, the radio station dropped him, and Crocker moved to L.A. and returned to school. \n\nAfter the payola charges were overturned, he returned to New York radio in 1979 as DJ and Program Director on WBLS-FM, at the end of the disco era. Crocker's career in radio ended by 1985. He moved to MTV as a VJ on the VH-1 cable channel.\n\nHe was charged in 1983 with hitting \"Penthouse\" Pet Carmela Pope; the charges were later dropped. He also was mentioned as a paramour of, and suspect in the February 12, 1977 murder of, the young Hollywood starlet Christa Helm.\n\nIn October 2000, Crocker went into a Miami area hospital for several weeks. He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and kept the illness a secret from his friends and even from his mother. He died on October 21, 2000.

We could only enter the playing room with hands pressed hard against our ears, and even then it was physically stunning. We ran a sick, outmoded beatbox through the P.A. and it blew out horrendous distorted pulsations. Of course, we recorded the whole thing, and a few months later we mixed it down into sections, ultra-processing it to a wholly other \"piece\". In a way, it's my favorite record of ours – I hope Jason [Knuth, to whom the release is dedicated] digs it. Keep on, keep on, keep on.\n\nJason Birchmeier of AllMusic wrote, \"Of the many strange recordings released by Sonic Youth over the course of their long career, few measure up to \"Silver Session for Jason Knuth\"\". Describing \"Silver Session\" as noise rock, he called it \"an interesting addition to their catalog, intended mainly for loyal fans.\"\n"}

Veneration of the Holy Family was formally begun in the 17th century by Saint François de Laval, the first bishop of New France, who founded a Confraternity.\n\nThe Feast of the Holy Family is a liturgical celebration in the Catholic Church and some Anglican Churches in honor of Jesus, his mother, and his legal father, Saint Joseph, as a family. The primary purpose of this feast is to present the Holy Family as a model for Christian families.\n\nThe Feast is held on the Sunday between Christmas and New Year's Day; If both are Sundays, the feast is celebrated on December 30th.\n\nThe Gospels speak little of the life of the Holy Family in the years before Jesus’ public ministry.\n\nMatthew and Luke narrate the episodes from this period of Christ's life, namely his circumcision and later Presentation, the flight to Egypt, the return to Nazareth, and the Finding in the Temple. Joseph and Mary were apparently observant Jews, as Luke narrates that they brought Jesus with them on the annual pilgrimage to Jerusalem with other Jewish families.\n\nThe Feast of the Holy Family is a liturgical celebration in the Catholic Church in honor of Jesus of Nazareth, his mother, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and his foster father, Saint Joseph, as a family. The primary purpose of this feast is to present the Holy Family as a model for Christian families.\n\nFrom the 17th century, the feast has been celebrated at a local and regional level and at that level was promoted by Pope Leo XIII. In 1921, Pope Benedict XV made it part of the General Roman Calendar and set on the Sunday within the Octave of the Epiphany; that is to say, on the Sunday between January 7 through January 13, all inclusive (see General Roman Calendar of 1954). The 1962 Roman Missal, whose use is still authorized in the circumstances indicated in the 2007 motu proprio \"Summorum Pontificum\", follows the General Roman Calendar of 1960, which has the celebration on that date.\n\nThe 1969 revision of the General Roman Calendar moved the celebration to Christmastide, assigning it to the Sunday within the Octave of Christmas, that is, the Sunday between Christmas Day and New Year's Day (both exclusive), or if both Christmas Day and the Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God are Sundays, on 30 December (always a Friday in such years). When not celebrated on a Sunday, it is not a holy day of obligation.\n\nFormerly, the Sunday within the Octave of Christmas was in fact celebrated only if it fell on 29, 30 or 31 December, since it gave way to the higher ranked feasts of Saint Stephen, Saint John the Apostle and the Holy Innocents. The Feast of the Holy Family that has replaced it outranks these three feasts.\n\nThe Holy Family is a popular theme in Christian art. An oil painting by the Dutch Joos van Cleve, dated to about 1512, is on display at the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art. Michelangelo's tempera rendition (c. 1506) hangs in the Uffizi in Florence, Italy. A Holy Family by Giulio Romano is on view at the Getty Center in Los Angeles, California.\n\nThe members of the Holy Family are the patrons of the Congregation of Holy Cross. The Holy Cross Sisters are dedicated to the Immaculate Heart of Mary, the Holy Cross Brothers to St. Joseph, and the Priests of Holy Cross to the Sacred Heart. The Sons of the Holy Family is another religious congregation devoted to the Holy Family.\n\nThe Cathedral of the Holy Family of Nazareth is the see of the Diocese of Tulsa in Oklahoma.\n\nA pious practice among Catholics is to write \"J.M.J.\" at the top of letters and personal notes as a reference to Jesus, Mary, and Joseph as the Holy Family.\n\n\n"}

He was an important figure of the Italian Wars: in the Battle of Ravenna in 1512 he was taken prisoner by the French, but was released at the conclusion of the War of the League of Cambrai. He was the chief commander of the Habsburg armies of Charles V in Italy during the Habsburg-Valois Wars and defeated the French at Bicocca and Pavia.\n\nFernando was born at Naples, but his family was of Aragonese origin, having arrived in southern Italy with Alfonso V's general Iñigo d'Avalos, his grandfather. Fernando's father was Alfonso d'Ávalos d'Aquino, 4th marquis of Pescara (not to be confused with Alfonso d'Ávalos, 6th marquess of Pescara and a cousin of Fernando).\n\nAt the age of six the boy was betrothed to Vittoria Colonna, daughter of the general Fabrizio Colonna, and the marriage was celebrated in 1509 on the island of Ischia. His position as a noble of the Aragonese party in Naples made it incumbent on him to support Ferdinand the Catholic in his Italian wars. In 1512, he commanded a body of light cavalry at the battle of Ravenna, where he was wounded and taken prisoner by the French. Thanks to the intervention of one of the foremost of the French generals, the Italian G. G. Trivulzio, who was his connection by marriage, he was allowed to ransom himself for 6,000 \"ducats\".\n\nHe commanded the Spanish infantry at the Battle of La Motta, or Vicenza, on October 7, 1513. It was on this occasion that he called his men before the charge to take care to step on him before the enemy did if he fell. From the battle of Vicenza in 1513, down to the Battle of Bicocca on April 29, 1522, he continued to serve in command of the Spaniards and as the colleague rather than the subordinate of Prospero Colonna.\n\nAfter the battle of Bicocca Charles V appointed Colonna commander-in-chief. D'Ávalos, who considered himself aggrieved, made a journey to Valladolid in Spain, where the emperor then was, to state his own claims. Charles V, with whom he had long and confidential interviews, persuaded him to submit for the time to the superiority of Colonna. But in these meetings he gained the confidence of Charles V. His Spanish descent and sympathies marked him out as a safer commander of the imperial troops in Italy than a \"full\" Italian could have been.\n\nWhen Francis I invaded Italy in 1524 d'Ávalos was appointed as lieutenant of the emperor to repel the invasion. The difficulties of his position were very great, for there was much discontent in the army, which was very ill-paid. The tenacity, patience and tact of d'Ávalos triumphed over all obstacles. His influence over the veteran Spanish troops and the German mercenaries kept them loyal during the long siege of Pavia.\n\nOn February 24, 1525 he defeated and took prisoner Francis I by a brilliant attack. D'Ávalos' plan was remarkable for its audacity and for the skill he showed in destroying the superior French heavy cavalry by assailing them in flank with a mixed force of harquebusiers and light horse. It was believed that he was dissatisfied with the treatment he had received from the emperor, and Girolamo Morone, secretary to Francesco II Sforza, duke of Milan, approached him with a scheme for expelling French, Spaniards and Germans alike from Italy, and for gaining a throne for himself. D'Ávalos may have listened to the tempter, but in act he was loyal. He reported the offer to Charles V and put Morone into prison. His health, however, had begun to give way under the strain of wounds and exposure, during late November, and he died at Milan on December 3, 1525.\n\nD'Ávalos had no children; his title descended to his cousin Alfonso d'Ávalos, Marquis del Vasto, also a distinguished imperial general (who in fact led the Imperial musketeers at Pavia).\n\nThe Italian historiographer Paolo Giovio published a contemporary biography in Latin of Fernando Francesco which was included in his \"Vitae \"(\"illustrium virorum\"). \nIt was subsequently translated by Lodovico Domenichi and published in Florence in 1551. Giovio's biography was also translated into Spanish by Pedro de Vallés in 1553 as \"Historia del fortissimo y prudentissimo capitan Don Hernando de Ávalos\".\n\nThe novel \"Die Versuchung des Pescara\" by Conrad Ferdinand Meyer is about him.\n\nJohn Webster's 'The Duchess of Malfi', first performed in 1613-1614, makes numerous references to The Marquis.\n\n"}
{"id": "2223417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2223417", "title": "Spontaneous Combustion (South Park)", "text": "Spontaneous Combustion (South Park)\n\n\"Spontaneous Combustion\" is the second episode of the third season of the American animated television series \"South Park\", and is the 33rd episode overall. It originally aired in the United States on April 14, 1999. \n\nIn the episode, Kenny and many other townsfolk start dying from spontaneous combustion. Mayor McDaniels puts Randy Marsh in charge of finding out why people are dying from it.\n\nKyle discovers that his dad and his mom are having marital difficulties caused by his dad's erectile dysfunction, and he and the others (Kenny, Stan, and Cartman) try to give him \"a ne-rection\" (which the boys confuse with \"a resurrection\"), unaware of what it actually is. Meanwhile, various members of the town, beginning with Kenny, start to spontaneously combust, which causes the townspeople to attend church more, and compels Mayor McDaniels to order Randy Marsh to discern the cause for the explosions.\n\nThe boys get drawn into presenting the Stations of the Cross in church, with Cartman tied to the cross in the role of Jesus, after repeated pleading that he could not play any other role. Afterwards, the boys take the cross and put it up outside the church, with Cartman still attached, so that he will die and get a \"res-erection\" to give to Kyle's dad. Meanwhile, Randy manages to find out that the combustions are caused by people refusing to fart in front of their partners (Kenny was spending some time with Kelly, his girlfriend from the previous episode) and so he encourages everyone in town to fart every few seconds. For this, he wins the Nobel Prize and a statue is made for him, much to the ire of South Park's only other scientist, Dr. Mephesto, who wanted to win the prize for creating a Galapagos turtle with seven asses; he then plots revenge.\n\nMeanwhile, Cartman (still on the cross), is getting upset and tired that Stan and Kyle will not take him down, even going as far as claiming his mom is worried and \"calling\" for him. He is later taken down by Chef until he tells him it was all \"just a dream\" and he is still on the cross, angering him even more.\n\nAnother crisis then comes up, when a heat wave hits the town, and again Randy is hired to figure out the cause. However, Mephesto beats him to it. He discovers that it is the methane gas from all the farting that led to the global warming. Randy, blamed for the crisis, is stripped of his Nobel Prize, and stoned and forced to walk through the town with his own statue on his back, being denied by his friends (as Jesus was in the Stations of the Cross). Meanwhile, Kyle's dad manages to get an erection, after seeing some attractive, young female clients undress in his office (to show him the skin cancer for which they claim Randy is responsible); after telling Kyle everything is going to be alright, Kyle is so glad for his father that he forgets about Cartman on the cross.\n\nRandy does not want to try to find a solution for his problem, since all the people in town would still hate him, even if he managed to solve the combustion/global warming conundrum. However, Stan tells him that he learned something from the Stations of the Cross: Even though Jesus was hated by all the people he knew and denied by his friends, he still did what he had to do and as he was dying, raised his right hand and stated, \"The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few\" (which Kyle later points out is a quote from \"\"). After going through extensive researching, Randy finds out that people need to fart only in moderation in order to fight against the global warming. This works well, and he ends up winning the town's accolades again, and gets his Nobel Prize back three weeks later, at which point the boys suddenly remember they had left Cartman out on the cross that long. They run to get him, and find him still alive but emaciated, having survived for three weeks on his accumulated body fat. Angered, Cartman then says (in a high pitched voice) that once he is taken down, he will kick both of them in the nuts. The song in Randy's daydream montage plays during the end credits.\n\n\"Spontaneous Combustion\" was written by \"South Park\" creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, and writer David Goodman. The episode was inspired in part by Stations of the Cross events Parker witnessed as a child. Parker said he thought it was funny to watch young children participate in the events, particularly in seeing the crucifixion of Jesus. Stone, an agnostic Jew and fellow \"South Park\" co-creator, had never heard of Stations of the Cross until Parker explained it to him during a meeting, to which Stone said, \"I just thought it was the funniest thing\". While making the episode, Parker and Stone were simultaneously making their \"South Park\" film, \"\". The duo would work on \"Spontaneous Combustion\" in one studio, then travel a mile away to a larger studio to work on the film. Paramount Pictures executives were not happy with the arrangement and preferred for Parker and Stone to stop working on the television series to focus on the film.\n\nIn writing the episode, Parker and Stone regularly consulted Anne Garefino, the \"South Park\" executive producer and a practicing Catholic; Stone said Garefino was a \"good sport about it\" and did not get offended by the show's jokes about Catholicism. Parker also said the show's elements about flatulence causing spontaneous combustion stemmed from his own serious belief that holding in farts can indeed cause humans to spontaneously combust. Parker said, \"I honestly think it could be what spontaneous combustion is because I've seen some dudes light their farts, and the fireballs were big. And that was just one fart. I'm serious, I think it's totally possible.\"\n\nThe episode satirizes religion in more ways than its reenactment of the Stations of the Cross. A church prayer, in which the priest prays for the success of the Denver Broncos, an NFL football team, has also been described as a satire on the way sports can take on a religious status due to the seriousness with which fans regard it. The priest also suggests Kenny might not have been killed if the \"South Park\" residents had attended church more regularly, which satirizes the use of guilt to encourage participation in religion; this is further demonstrated by Mr. Garrison's comment, \"Oh, here comes the guilt trip again!\" Religious writer Michel Clasquin said the episode also demonstrates the way in which people \"go through the right motions\" in practicing religion by attending church, but disregard religion in their everyday lives; he cites the example that when Stan asks his father where their copy of the Bible is, he says it's in the attic \"with the old LPs\". Clasquin said \"Spontaneous Combustion\" also demonstrates the ease with which people blend their religious convictions with lessons from pop culture, particularly with Stan's confusion of a biblical verse and a \"Star Trek\" quote. Nevertheless, Clasquin said Stan does ultimately learn lessons of sacrifice and selflessness from the story of Jesus' crucifixion, so the episode ultimately upholds some of the more positive aspects of religion and Christianity.\n\nThe episode also satirizes adult pretentiousness, a common theme in \"South Park\" episodes, by portraying the children as wiser and more reasonable in seeking a solution to the spontaneous combustion problem. Although the adults follow trends and solutions that contradict common sense, namely avoiding spontaneous combustion by passing gas at all times, only the children are able to find a reasonable solution in the middle of two extremes: only passing gas when absolutely necessary or when it is \"really, really funny\".\n\nCartman and the other South Park children reenact the Stations of the Cross, the depiction of the Passion (final hours) of Jesus, which end with his crucifixion. The line Stan quotes, which he mistakes for a Bible verse, is a line spoken by Spock in \"\": \"The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.\" During a church service, the priest refers to two players who left the Denver Broncos: Neil Smith, who left the team in 1999 after becoming a free agent, and Steve Atwater, who joined the New York Jets in 1999. When Officer Barbrady passes by Cartman and says \"T, T is for turtle\", he is impersonating the typewriter from Sesame Street. Randy's daydream, which depicts a mummy chasing Stan, Kyle and himself through a series of doors, is a reference to Scooby-Doo. Kyle's dad hears a Bob Dole commercial for an erectile dysfunction medicine when listening to the radio in his office.\n\nThe episode was condemned by Graham Capill, the New Zealand conservative politician heading the Christian Heritage Party of New Zealand, now defunct. Capill, who was campaigning against the film \"\", which was released around the same time \"Spontaneous Combustion\" was broadcast, took exception to the episode's portrayal of the Stations of the Cross reenactment.\n\nMany reviewers recommended the episode while simultaneously commenting on its offensive material. Peter Lalor of \"The Daily Telegraph\" described it as \"another highly-recommended episode, although if you have sensitive Christian values perhaps you would be better off missing this episode\". Paul Thompson, of the \"Waikato Times\", praised the episode and said it \"had all the show's ingredients: obnoxious kids, hypocritical adults and barbed humour.\" Robert Bianco of \"USA Today\" recommended the episode, but said it was \"almost certain to offend large segments of the population\", particularly for its take on the Stations of the Cross. Although the \"Daily Breeze\" recommended the episode, they said it proved, \"silliness and outrageousness continue to be this cartoon's calling card\".\n\nDoug Pratt, a DVD reviewer and \"Rolling Stone\" contributor, gave \"Spontaneous Combustion\" a negative review; he called it \"pretty dopey\" and said \"Sure, it's funny if you like passing gas jokes, but its aspirations are limited.\"\n\nThe \"Chicago Tribune\" included \"Spontaneous Combustion\" in a list of seven \"South Park\" episodes illustrating the show's tendency to tackle controversial subjects, particularly with regard to religion.\n\n"}
{"id": "2223425", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2223425", "title": "Cleopatra Jones", "text": "Cleopatra Jones\n\nCleopatra Jones is a 1973 American blaxploitation action comedy film directed by Jack Starrett and starring Tamara Dobson, Bernie Casey, Shelley Winters and Antonio Fargas.\n\nCleopatra \"Cleo\" Jones (Dobson) is an undercover special agent for the United States Government. Overseas modeling is only a cover for her real job. Cleo is a Bond-like heroine with power and influence, her silver and black '73 Corvette Stingray (equipped with automatic weapons), and her martial arts ability. While she evokes the glory of a funk goddess, she remains loyal to her drug-ravaged community and her lover, Reuben Masters (Bernie Casey), who runs B&S House (a community home for recovering drug addicts).\n\nThe film opens with Cleo overseeing the destruction of a poppy field in Turkey belonging to the evil drug lord, Mommy (Shelley Winters). Mommy employs an all-male crew and a bevy of beautiful young women catering to her many wants. When she hears about her poppies' demise, she plots revenge, ordering a corrupt policeman to raid the B&S House.\n\nWhen Cleo returns to LA to arrest the police responsible for the raid, she continues to take apart Mommy's underworld drug business, thwarting her minions along the way. Cleo and Mommy face off in a showdown, in which she is trapped by Mommy in a car crusher but is saved by her friends from the B&S House. In the final showdown, Cleo chases Mommy to the top of a magnetic crane where the two women fight. Mommy proves to be no match for Cleo, who hurls Mommy over the side of the crane to her death, while Cleo's friends defeat her henchmen. At the end of the film, as Reuben and the members of the community celebrate victory, Cleo departs the scene. She sets off to complete her mission of stemming the tide of drugs that flow into her community.\n\n\n\"Cleopatra Jones\" was made by Warner Brothers following the success of the \"Shaft\" series and AIP’s films. It opened at a time when the Black Power Movement, Black Arts Movement, second-wave feminism, and an increasingly growing black feminism were all prevalent. From this social context emerged the desire for a black heroine who appealed to women through a combination of alluring femininity, female strength, and combat skill. The film depicts the harsh reality of the black ghetto, but also portrays a united community whose members help and support one another. The film's final scene, where Jones, Reuben, and the other B&S members join together to defeat Mommy, reflects the Black Arts Movement's emphasis upon the need for the black community to work together to defeat white supremacy.\n\nAlthough \"Cleopatra Jones\" contains themes relating specifically to the Black Power and feminist movements, it appeals to the general public and is said to be the “first blaxploitation film to use martial arts as part of its promotion.” It appeals to audiences who enjoy action movies (such as the James Bond series) and has invited comparisons between Jones and Bond. One critic noted “On the surface, Cleopatra Jones is about a black distaff James Bond who drives a fancy car equipped with a submachine gun in the door, wears smart clothes, is a karate expert, and travels all over the world as a United States secret agent, destroying the poppy wherever it is found.” Another critic, Chris Norton, even suggested, “Like Bond, Cleo is not a stealthy character who tries to infiltrate the underworld by losing her identity… Bond seldom tried to hide his identity, often using his real name during introductions, and all Bond films rely on his being recognized as 007.” Likewise, Jones is rarely undercover, and is flashy and flamboyant on the job. Norton continues by saying “Cleo’s outrageous outfits are also analogous with Bond’s dinner jackets and playboy wardrobe. Her three-foot hat brims and flowing fur robes are treated with respect and awe within the film, just as Bond’s refinements are looked upon as the height of good taste… [However,] Cleo is not simply a black James Bond. While the Cleopatra Jones films have co-opted Bond, they avoid a total fusion of her character of Bond.”\n\nHowever, the film is also extremely—and deliberately—funny, with over-the-top villains and crackling one-liners. These were presumably the work of co-writer Sheldon Keller, a veteran TV comedy specialist whose numerous credits include \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\" and \"Caesar's Hour\".\n\nMax Julien originally wrote the part of Jones for his then-girlfriend Vonetta McGee, but the part was eventually given to Dobson, a fashion model whose height inspired the film's tag line: “6 feet 2 inches of dynamite.” Although blaxploitation films generally used sex to attract an audience, \"Cleopatra Jones\" was comparatively modest, containing no nudity or explicit sex.\n\nJust as her character Cleopatra Jones came from a poor, high-crime neighborhood, Dobson came from humble, working-class roots. She grew up in Baltimore's inner city; her mother owned a beauty salon and her father worked at a railroad station. After earning a degree from the Baltimore Institute of Art, Dobson moved to New York City to become a model. Her race proved an obstacle until she caught the attention of movie producers searching for a black heroine.\n\n\"Cleopatra Jones\" has been analyzed by academics, particularly its attitudes towards race, sex and feminism. It is argued the film illustrates the film industry's progress toward gender equality. While Jones is both feminine and fashionable, at the same time she is talented in combat and driving, even more so than the men in the film. She is seen as a strong, assertive and combative woman who is able to both appeal to men and defeat them physically. On one hand, Jones competitively combats with Mommy's male henchmen but on the other, she maintains a loving relationship with Reuben. Cleopatra and Reuben's relationship can be considered a more progressive look at black male and black female relations at the time. Reuben is a strong black man who also cares for recovering kids at the B&S House. However he is also willing to fight as he comes to Jones's aid and they fight alongside one another. Their relationship emphasizes the equality and mutual respect in a relationship that has both strong female and male counterparts.\n\nAlthough Jones’ character and relationships are in keeping with feminist principles, the portrayal of Mommy is perceived as less groundbreaking. She is presented as a hypersexual lesbian; her character displays many negative traits, such as her constant lust and obsession with sex. Mommy exerts tyrannical control over her henchmen and physically and verbally abuses her young female attendants.\n\nThus, it is proposed the film's homophobic treatment of Mommy hints at the film's anti-feminism in the white feminist sense. During this period, feminism was “often seen as a white woman’s movement; some have seen it as anti-black.” Even Dobson stated that a message she would have liked the film to portray would have been a more centered approach towards racial equality rather than gender. She stated in an interview, “We’re trying to free our men. I believe in equal pay… I don’t want to talk about it, because I don’t think of Cleopatra Jones as being a women’s libber. I see her as a very positive, strong lady who knows what she has to do.”\n\nTherefore, this film indicates a clear distinction between what is seen as white feminism and black feminism. While white feminism is shunned by the community and is mocked through the character Mommy, black feminism is seen as more approachable and harmless, seen in the loving yet equal relationship between Jones and Reuben, as well as Jones’ heroine status. Contrasted together, Mommy's whiteness, lesbianism, and phallic power highlight Cleopatra Jones’ heterosexual appeal, blackness, and phallic power. Jones’ sophistication emphasizes Mommy's low-class corruption while Jones’ feminine masculinity highlights Mommy's “butch” lesbianism.\n\nCleopatra Jones differs from other blaxploitation films which depict what scholars have described as a “phallic heroine.\" Dobson herself refused to do nude scenes, striving to separate herself from the hypersexuality of many other black heroines of the time. Her opinion that “sex is more interesting when you don’t show everything at once” is clearly indicated by her modesty throughout the film. During a love scene between Jones and Reuben, the two share a long, intimate kiss rather than passionately making love. The scene illustrates love and intimacy rather than the lust often depicted in other popular blaxploitation films. Jones flaunts her sexuality through her appearance, managing to remain an autonomous and strong female protagonist.\n\nDobson's role was an example of the potential of a new black female presence in popular action cinema. In the earlier 1970s, the Hollywood-supported black urban ghetto action films followed one of a few plot lines: the black pimp or drug hustler on a mission for material wealth and autonomy from “the Man,” the lone hero from the ghetto with white institutional power, or the legitimate hero whose mission is to stop drug activity within the black community. The last narrative, albeit more rare than the others, can be seen in \"Cleopatra Jones\".\n\nWhile Jones works for “the Man”, a white, all-powerful leader (the American government), the film also indicates a move toward racial equality. Jones works for an unnamed agency and wears a badge that reads “Special Agent to the President.” Ironically, though she works for the white government, Jones is clearly better at policing black neighborhoods than are white cops. \"Cleopatra Jones\" replaces the traditional white male action hero with a powerful and assertive black heroine. Also, her mission is directly related to improving the black community.\n\nSome symbolism of the racist movement is contained with the bigoted police officer Purdy (Bill McKinney). His disdain for blacks is shown at the raid on the B&S house where he attempts to shoot a recovering addict in the back. Another instance displaying the stereotypical white police officer racism is seen when Jones asks him who was responsible for raid on B&S house and Purdy replies, “I never planted no dope on nobody! And if I did, I wouldn’t lift a finger to help you or any of your kind.”\n\nAnother theme within the film is the Black Power generated “Black is Beautiful” consciousness seen in Jones's appearance. Although she is seen as a center of attraction and sexuality, she still wears an Afro which signified black affirmation. Jones's obscured hair underscores racial difference and departure from the traditional long hair as a sign of white, feminine sexual beauty. Also, her colorful and flashy outfits were a departure from the more modest, classy appeal of the James Bond hero. These emphasized a departure from the traditional white male hero. Dobson herself believed that her role enabled black beauty to be more visible in mainstream media. She stated, “It’s true there are very few black models. You won’t see them smiling out at you from the covers of major magazines. Editors blame this on the market… but I say forget the market- we’re talking about a pretty girl. I’ve seen oooogly white girls on magazine covers. But black girls must be safe. They must have straight hair, or hair that can be pressed, and they must have Caucasian features.” Dobson's role created an entertaining, “safe” ground for black women to retain their ethnic appearances while still being portrayed as strikingly beautiful and powerful.\n\nCritic Francesca T. Royster states, “Tamara Dobson is a lost African queen, dripping in furs and silk robes. She is a hybrid of an exotic queen from the past, a homegirl who knows her way around her old neighborhood of Watts and a special agent for the CIA. In the film, we see a double act of appropriation made possible by the ambiguity of the Cleopatra icon.” Shots of Dobson emphasize her exotic beauty especially when imaged through the male gaze. As Cleopatra strolls down the street, men of every race and age are dazzled by her black beauty.\n\nJones indicates at every turn that the unique, exotic beauty of the African culture is even more striking than traditionally white signifiers of beauty. Even her wardrobe signifies departure from standard, classy apparel yet remains aesthetically pleasing. She appears in rich reds and yellows, tailored pantsuits, clinging silk shirts, voluptuous fur jackets, turbans, silk headdresses, and hooded capes. These outfits create the glamorous identity that is beautiful, black, female, and endowed with unusual social empowerment. Critic Annette Kuhn explains that “a glamorous/glamourised image then is one manipulated, falsified perhaps, in order to heighten or even to idealize. A glamorous image of a woman (or an image of a glamorous woman) is peculiarly powerful in that it plays on the desire of the spectator in a particularly pristine way: beauty or sexuality is desirable exactly to the extent that it is idealized and unattainable.”\n\nOn the other hand, critics may view the emphasis on Jones's exoticism to be racially stereotypical rather than glorifying black beauty. Parts of Dobson's physicality reverbate with notions of black animalistic imagery. Jones appears in elaborate fur coverings and dramatic makeup, especially around the eyes. Lisa Anderson describes such imagery: “The animal metaphors resurface; the jezebel is represented as a tiger, a puma, a panther, or other large, sleek cat who slinks up and pounces on her prey. She is a frightening apparition in the white imagination.”\n\n\"Cleopatra Jones\" is accompanied by a rhythm-and-blues soundtrack featuring Joe Simon singing “Theme from Cleopatra Jones” and Millie Jackson singing “Love Doctor” and “It Hurts So Good.” Instrumentals on the soundtrack include “Goin’ to the Chase,” \"Wrecking Yard\" and “Go Chase Cleo.” \"Oriental-style\" music combined with jazz, bass and strings creates an exotic tone. At the same time, the bluesy rhythm alludes to black jazz culture, appropriate for an action-hero movie taking place in the African-American community. The song “Theme from Cleopatra Jones” emphasizes the fantasy of erotic pleasure for men: “You’re so sweet and strong…/Touch me like the desert wind.” In the theme song, the lyrics depict the threat and thrill of her exotic beauty: “You take my pride and you throw it up against the wall/You take me in your arms, baby, and bounce me like a rubber ball…/ Dontcha know that it hurts so good.” The soundtrack was a popular success, selling well over 500,000 copies.\n\nThe film opened to a favorable critical reception. Says Los Angeles film critic Kevin Thomas, \"Cleopatra Jones\" is “an exceptionally well-made black action picture…From start to finish this fast-moving Warner’s release is shrewdly calculated and affirms the gifts of its director Jack in bringing style and meaning to the exploitation picture. In her first starring role Miss Dobson more than makes up for her lack of acting experience by her dazzling looks, sultry personality, and unwavering poise.”\n\nTapping into the Black Pride movement, the irony of using the name Cleopatra to convey a character who was strong physically, but equally feminine and independent, appealed to the urban public. As the queen of Egypt, Cleopatra's role as a leader allowed African American women to identify with Dobson's character and finally call a heroine their own.\n\nOn the other hand, critics of the blaxploitation industry complained that they were “dismayed by Tamara’s image as a karate-chopping, pistol popping terror.” In response Dobson replied “You go through phases until you find the right situation where a character works for you. A lot of tits and ass movies were made, ballbuster films, exploitation pictures. But I don’t care what anybody calls it. Doing Cleopatra Jones gave me a chance to work. I loved Cleo. She was not only gracious, but strong, clever, intelligent and sexy.”\n\nThe film was a box office success, grossing more than $100,000 in its first week of release, climbing to $400,000 by the fifth week.\n\nA sequel, \"Cleopatra Jones and the Casino of Gold\" appeared in 1975, with Dobson reprising\nthe title role. Jones travels to Hong Kong to free government agents Matthew and Melvin Johnson who have been captured by the Dragon Lady (Stella Stevens). Jones pairs up with Tanny (Ni Tien) and ends up in the Dragon Lady's casino, headquarters for her underground drug empire. Jones and Tanny use their combat skills to battle the Dragon Lady's henchmen and defeat the Dragon Lady herself.\n\nThe sequel's lack of popularity was due not only to its poor reviews but also to the decline of blaxploitation films in general.\n\n\n"}

It begins on the day of Epiphany, and ends at various points as defined by those churches.\n\nIn Advent 2000, the Church of England introduced into its liturgy an optional Epiphany season by approving the \"Common Worship\" series of services as an alternative to those in the \"Book of Common Prayer\", defining Epiphanytide as lasting from the feast of the Epiphany to Candlemas.\n\nAn official publication of the Church of England states: \"The Christmas season is often celebrated for twelve days, ending with the Epiphany. Contemporary use has sought to express an alternative tradition, in which Christmas lasts for a full forty days, ending with the Feast of the Presentation on February 2.\" It presents the latter part of this period as the Epiphany season, comprising the Sundays of Epiphany and ending \"only with the Feast of the Presentation (Candlemas)\".\n\nThe Church of England's optional Epiphany season thus begins at Evening Prayer on the Eve of the Epiphany (which may be celebrated on January 6 or the Sunday between January 2 and 8) and ends at Evening Prayer (or Night Prayer) on the Feast of the Presentation (which may be celebrated on 2 February or on the Sunday between January 28 and February 3). The Epiphany season is seen as in some sense a continuation of the Christmas season, and together they last forty days. The three main events focused on during the Epiphany season are the visit of the Magi, the baptism of Jesus, and Jesus' miracle at the marriage at Cana. The visit of the Magi is traditionally interpreted as symbolic of God's revelation of himself to the Gentiles, and so one of the themes of the season is mission. The Week of Prayer for Christian Unity also falls within the season, allowing another seasonal theme to be that of unity. The season culminates at the Feast of the Presentation, after which the liturgy stops looking back to Christmas and begins looking forward to the Passion. The colour for the season is white.\n\nSeveral Protestant churches celebrate an Epiphany season that lasts until the day before Ash Wednesday, which marks the beginning of the season of Lent. As such, in some adaptations of the Revised Common Lectionary, such as those used by Methodists and Lutherans, the Epiphanytide begins on 6 January, and continues until the day before Ash Wednesday (which begins Lent). The last Sunday of Epiphany is Transfiguration Sunday.\n\nMethodists in the United States follow this practice, as do Methodists in Singapore.\n\nIn one interpretation the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America celebrates on the day of Epiphany, 6 January, the revelation of Christ to all nations as represented by the magi who come to worship Jesus. The church calendar recognizes the season of Epiphany from January 6 until the last Sunday before Ash Wednesday which is celebrated as the Transfiguration of our Lord. The length of the season of Epiphany varies and is determined by working backwards through the season of Lent from the moveable date for the celebration of Easter. Among the principal themes are: the revelation of Christ to all nations, Jesus' baptism in the River Jordan, and Christ as the light of the world. The colours of the season are white (a colour associated with the festivals of Christ and suggesting gladness, joy and light for the day of Epiphany), used the first week after the Epiphany when the Baptism of our Lord is celebrated, and the last week of the season of Epiphany when the Transfiguration of our Lord is celebrated; and green, reminiscent of living plants and suggests spiritual growth. Green is used in the season of Epiphany beginning with the second week after the Epiphany until the week before the Transfiguration of our Lord is celebrated.\n\nThe Evangelical Lutheran Church in America used the terms \"Time after Epiphany\" to describe this period. The expression with \"after\" has been interpreted as making the period in question correspond to that of Ordinary Time.\n\nThe Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) states that neither Epiphany nor Pentecost are seasons, and that it is a misunderstanding to imagine that expressions such as \"Fifth Sunday after Epiphany\" indicate the existence of such a time as \"Epiphany season\". These expression merely indicate the passing of time, not the character of the period, for neither the period after Epiphany nor that after Pentecost focus on a dominant event or theme. The correct term, it says, is therefore \"Ordinary Time\".\n\nThe calendar of the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter and the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham within the Roman Catholic Church (which uses Ordinariate Use liturgy) celebrates Epiphanytide or the Time After Epiphany from \"Monday of Week 1 on the day following the [Feast of the] Baptism of the Lord\" until the liturgical start of Ash Wednesday; during Epiphanytide, Candlemas is highlighted as a \"Feast of the Lord\".\n\nWithin the Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church, until 1955, the feast of the Epiphany had an octave, and was thus celebrated from 6 until 13 January. After Pope Pius XII removed this octave, the liturgy of those days continued to use the same texts as previously, thus giving to the period until the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord, which replaced the Octave Day of the Epiphany, a special character that was still recognized by the 1960 Code of Rubrics. This defined the season of Christmas as extending from First Vespers of Christmas to 13 January inclusive, and divided this season into Christmastide, ending just before First Vespers of the Epiphany, and Epiphany (not Epiphanytide and, as is obvious, no longer the Octave of the Epiphany) from then until 13 January inclusive (one week). The 1969 revision preserved the arrangement by which the Epiphany is part of the Christmas season, during which the liturgical colour is white, and which now lasts only until the feast of the Baptism of the Lord. This latter feast is now usually celebrated on the Sunday after 6 January, and not later than 13 January. The season immediately following the Octave Day of the Epiphany (until 1954), or the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord (since 1955), and in which the liturgical colour is green, was for the first time given a name in the 1960 Code of Rubrics, which in Latin called it the season \"per annum\". The official English translation of the Roman Missal calls it Ordinary Time. This season begins on 14 January. Until 1969, it ran from that date to just before First Vespers of Septuagesima Sunday, but since 1970 to just before Ash Wednesday. However, the \"Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices\", which has received the imprimatur of John Michael D'Arcy, refers to this period as Epiphanytide, stating that \"The Epiphany season extends from January 6 to Septuagesima Sunday, and has from one to six Sundays, according to the date of Easter. White is the color for the octave; green is the liturgical color for the season.\"\n"}

It is a part of the Pannonian plain which covers most parts of Hungary.\n\nIts borders are the Carpathians on the north, the Bakony-Vértes Hills in the south, the Gerecse Hills in the east, and the Leitha Mountains and the foothills of the Alps in the west. In Hungary, it includes most of Győr-Moson-Sopron and Vas counties, and the western part of Komárom-Esztergom and Veszprém.\n\nThe plain is roughly cut in half by the Danube which is split up into many arms between Bratislava and Komárno, forming large islands. Its main tributaries are the Váh, the Rába, the Rábca and the Marcal rivers.\n\nSmaller microregions of the Little Alföld are Hanság, Seewinkel, Neusiedl Basin, Rábaköz, Szigetköz, Marcali Basin, Moson Plain, Komárom-Esztergom Plain and Žitný ostrov.\n\nThe neighbouring regions of Kemeneshát, Sopron-Vas Plain and Steirisches Hügelland are sometimes classified as belonging to the Little Alföld, but Hungarian and Austrian geographers use the term in a more narrow meaning.\n\nThe plain has been an important area of agriculture since the Neolithic Age. The southern part of it belonged to the Roman province of Pannonia between the 1st and 5th centuries and later was inhabited by Germanic and Slavic peoples and since about 900 also by Hungarians. Since about 1000, the region became part of the Kingdom of Hungary. After World War I the Little Alföld was divided between Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Austria. In the 1990s Slovakia built a large dam and power plant at Gabčíkovo.\n\nCountry borders don't closely follow linguistic boundaries, especially in the case of the northern part of the plain where Hungarians are a majority in the two southernmost districts Dunajská Streda and Komárno and a minority in the remaining districts. There are also smaller groups of Croats in the tri-state border region. Important cities in the region are Győr (HU), Komárom (HU), Komárno (SK), Dunajská Streda (SK), Nové Zámky (SK), and Mosonmagyaróvár (HU).\n\n"}

They are related to the class I MHC molecules, and are involved in the presentation of lipid antigens to T cells. However their precise function is unknown.\n\nCD1 glycoproteins can be classified primarily into two groups which differ in their lipid anchoring.\n\n\nCD1e is an intermediate form, expressed intracellularly, the role of which is currently unclear.\n\nGroup 1 CD1 molecules have been shown to present foreign lipid antigens, and specifically a number of mycobacterial cell wall components, to CD1-specific T cells.\n\nThe natural antigens of group 2 CD1 are not well characterized, but a synthetic glycolipid, alpha-galactosylceramide, originally isolated from a compound found in a marine sponge, has strong biologic activity.\n\nGroup 2 CD1 molecules activate a group of T cells, known as Natural killer T cells because of their expression of NK surface markers such as CD161. Natural Killer T (NKT) cells are activated by CD1d-presented antigens, and rapidly produce Th1 and Th2 cytokines, typically represented by interferon-gamma and IL-4 production.\n\nThe group 2 (CD1d) ligand alpha-galactosylceramide is currently in phase I clinical trials for the treatment of advanced non-hematologic cancers.\n\nCD1 antigens are expressed on cortical thymocytes, but not on mature T cells. This often remains true in neoplastic cells from these populations, so that the presence of CD1 antigens can be used in diagnostic immunohistochemistry to identify some thymomas and malignancies arising from T cell precursors. CD1a, in particular, is a specific marker for Langerhans cells, and can therefore also be used in the diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Other conditions that may show CD1 positivity include myeloid leukaemia and some B cell lymphomas.\n\nMice lack the group 1 CD1 molecules, and instead have 2 copies of CD1d. Thus, mice have been used extensively to characterize the role of CD1d and CD1d-dependent NKT cells in a variety of disease models.\n\nIt has recently been shown that cows lack the group 2 CD1 molecules, and have an expanded set of group 1 CD1 molecules. Because of this and the fact that cows are a natural host of Mycobacterium bovis, a pathogen in humans as well, it is hoped that studying cows will yield insights into the group 1 CD1 antigen-presenting system.\n\n"}
{"id": "2223457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2223457", "title": "Carcinoid", "text": "Carcinoid\n\nA carcinoid (also carcinoid tumor) is a slow-growing type of neuroendocrine tumor originating in the cells of the neuroendocrine system. In some cases, metastasis may occur. Carcinoid tumors of the midgut (jejunum, ileum, appendix, and cecum) are associated with carcinoid syndrome.\n\nCarcinoid tumors are the most common malignant tumor of the appendix, but they are most commonly associated with the small intestine, and they can also be found in the rectum and stomach. They are known to grow in the liver, but this finding is usually a manifestation of metastatic disease from a primary carcinoid occurring elsewhere in the body. They have a very slow growth rate compared to most malignant tumors. The median age at diagnosis for all patients with neuroendocrine tumors is 63 years.\n\nWhile most carcinoids are asymptomatic through the natural lifetime and are discovered only upon surgery for unrelated reasons (so-called \"coincidental carcinoids\"), all carcinoids are considered to have malignant potential.\n\nAbout 10% of carcinoids secrete excessive levels of a range of hormones, most notably serotonin (5-HT), causing:\n\nThe outflow of serotonin can cause a depletion of tryptophan leading to niacin deficiency. Niacin deficiency, also known as pellagra, is associated with dermatitis, dementia, and diarrhea.\n\nThis constellation of symptoms is called \"carcinoid syndrome\" or (if acute) \"carcinoid crisis\". Occasionally, haemorrhage or the effects of tumor bulk are the presenting symptoms. The most common originating sites of carcinoid is the small bowel, particularly the ileum; carcinoid tumors are the most common malignancy of the appendix. Carcinoid tumors may rarely arise from the ovary or thymus.\n\nThey are most commonly found in the midgut at the level of the ileum or in the appendix. The next most common affected area is the respiratory tract, with 28% of all cases—per PAN-SEER data (1973–1999). The rectum is also a common site.\n\nCarcinoid tumors are apudomas that arise from the enterochromaffin cells throughout the gut. Over two-thirds of carcinoid tumors are found in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nCarcinoid tumors are also found in the lungs.\n\nMetastasis of carcinoid can lead to carcinoid syndrome. This is due to the over-production of many substances, including serotonin, which are released into the systemic circulation, and which can lead to symptoms of cutaneous flushing, diarrhea, bronchoconstriction, and right-sided cardiac valve disease. It is estimated that less than 6% of carcinoid patients will develop carcinoid syndrome, and of these, 50% will have cardiac involvement.\n\nThis is considered to be a hybrid between an exocrine and endocrine tumor derived from crypt cells of the appendix. Histologically, it forms clusters of goblet cells containing mucin with a minor admixture of Paneth cells and endocrine cells. The growth pattern is distinctive: typically producing a concentric band of tumor nests interspersed among the muscle and stroma of the appendiceal wall extending up the shaft of the appendix. This makes the lesion difficult to suspect grossly and difficult to measure. Small tumor nests may be camouflaged amongst the muscle or in periappendiceal fat; cytokeratin preparations best demonstrate the tumor cells; mucin stains are also helpful in identifying them. They behave in a more aggressive manner than do classical appendiceal carcinoids. Spread is usually to regional lymph nodes, peritoneum, and particularly the ovary. They do not produce sufficient hormonal substances to cause the carcinoid or other endocrine syndromes. In fact, they more closely resemble exocrine than endocrine tumors. The term 'crypt cell carcinoma' has been used for them, and though perhaps more accurate than considering them carcinoids, has not been a successful competitor.\n\nCarcinoid syndrome involves multiple tumors in 1/5 of cases. The incidence of gastric carcinoids is increased in achlorhydria, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and pernicious anemia.\n\nSurgery, if feasible, is the only curative therapy. If the tumor has metastasized (most commonly, to the liver) and is considered incurable, there are some promising treatment modalities, such as radiolabeled octreotide (e.g. Lutetium (Lu) DOTA-octreotate) or the radiopharmaceutical 131I-mIBG (meta iodo benzyl guanidine) for arresting the growth of the tumors and prolonging survival in patients with liver metastases, though these are currently experimental.\n\nChemotherapy is of little benefit and is generally not indicated. Octreotide or lanreotide (somatostatin analogues) may decrease the secretory activity of the carcinoid, and may also have an anti-proliferative effect. Interferon treatment is also effective, and usually combined with somatostatin analogues.\n\nAs the metastatic potential of a coincidental carcinoid is probably low, the current recommendation is for follow up in 3 months with CT or MRI, labs for tumor markers such as serotonin, and a history and physical, with annual physicals thereafter.\n\nThey were first characterized in 1907 by Siegfried Oberndorfer, a German pathologist at the University of Munich, who coined the term \"karzinoide\", or \"carcinoma-like\", to describe the unique feature of behaving like a benign tumor despite having a malignant appearance microscopically. The recognition of their endocrine-related properties were later described by Gosset and Masson in 1914, and these tumors are now known to arise from the enterochromaffin (EC) and enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells of the gut. Some sources credit Otto Lubarsch with the discovery.\n\nIn 2000, the World Health Organization redefined \"carcinoid\", but this new definition has not been accepted by all practitioners. This has led to some complexity in distinguishing between carcinoid and other neuroendocrine tumors in the literature. According to the American Cancer Society, the 2000 WHO definition states:\nThe WHO now divides these growths into neuroendocrine tumors and neuroendocrine cancers. Neuroendocrine tumors are growths that look benign but that might possibly be able to spread to other parts of the body. Neuroendocrine cancers are abnormal growths of neuroendocrine cells which can spread to other parts of the body.\n"}

Reference to Kitezh appears for the first time in \"Kitezh Chronicle\", an anonymous book from the late 18th century, believed to have originated among the Old Believers.\n\nLegend has it that Georgy II, Grand Prince of Vladimir in the early 13th century, first built the town of Maly Kitezh (Little Kitezh) on the Volga River (today's Krasny Kholm). It is sometimes erroneously identified with Gorodets, which was actually founded some 30 years before Georgy's birth in 1189. Later on, the prince crossed the rivers of Uzola, Sanda, and Kerzhenets, and found a beautiful spot on the shores of Lake Svetloyar, where he decided to build the town of Bolshoy Kitezh (Big Kitezh). According to folk etymology, the name of the town came from the royal residence of Kideksha (near Suzdal), ransacked by the Mongols in 1237, while Max Vasmer labels the place-name as \"obscure\".\n\nAfter having conquered some of the Russian lands, Batu Khan heard of Kitezh and ordered his army to advance towards it. The Mongols soon captured Maly Kitezh, forcing Georgy to retreat into the woods towards Bolshoy Kitezh. One of the prisoners told the Mongols about some secret paths to Lake Svetloyar. The army of the Golden Horde followed Georgy and soon reached the walls of the town. To the surprise of the Mongols, the town had no fortifications whatsoever. Its citizens didn't even intend to defend themselves and were engaged in fervent praying, asking God for their salvation. On seeing this, the Mongols rushed to the attack, but then stopped. Suddenly, they saw countless fountains of water bursting from under the ground all around them. The attackers fell back and watched the town submerge into the lake. The last thing they saw was a glaring dome of a cathedral with a cross on top of it. Soon only waves remained.\n\nThis legend gave birth to numerous incredible rumors, which have survived to this day. It is said that only those who are pure in their heart and soul will find their way to Kitezh (the road to the lake is still called \"Батыева тропа\", or the Path of Batu). It is also said that in calm weather one can sometimes hear the sound of chiming bells and people singing from under the waters of Lake Svetloyar. Some people say that the most pious individuals may actually see the lights of religious processions (called \"крестный ход\") and even buildings on the bottom of the lake. For this reason Lake Svetloyar is sometimes called the \"Russian Atlantis\".\n\n"}

After a sixteen-year absence, Adam returned for the last time in March 1988 as Wotan in \"Die Walküre\" with Peter Hofmann as Siegmund, Sabine Hass as Sieglinde, conducted by James Levine.\n\nAdam appeared in a number of world premieres, especially three operas written for him: the title roles in Paul Dessau's \"\" (1974, Berlin) and Friedrich Cerha's \"Baal\", an adaption of Bertolt Brecht's play \"Baal\", (1981, Salzburg), and the role of Prospero in Berio's \"Un re in ascolto\" (1984, Salzburg). A reviewer wrote about \"Baal\": \"Adam had to reinvent himself. He usually looks noble in whatever part he sings, perhaps appearing so naturally, whereas here he had to act the dissolute anarchist.\" In 1979, Adam was named a \"Kammersänger\" of the Vienna State Opera.\n\nAdam recorded several complete operas, including Mozart's \"Così fan tutte\" (1969), \"Fidelio\" (1969 and 1979), \"Der fliegende Holländer\" (with Anja Silja, conducted by Otto Klemperer, 1968), \"Der Freischütz\" (1973 and 1985), \"Hänsel und Gretel\" (1970), Beethoven's \"Leonore\" (with Edda Moser and Richard Cassilly, 1976), \"Die Meistersinger\" (conducted by Karajan 1970), \"Parsifal\" (as Amfortas, with René Kollo in the title role, 1975), \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\" (conducted by Karl Böhm, 1966–67; and by Marek Janowski, 1980–1983), \"Tannhäuser\" (1968–69), \"Wozzeck\" (1970 and 1973), and Mozart's \"Die Zauberflöte\" (as Sarastro, 1968; elsewhere as the Sprecher). He participated in the first recording of the Berio's \"Un re in ascolto\" (with Karan Armstrong, conducted by Lorin Maazel, 1984). His non-operatic recordings include the Raphael in Haydn's \"Die Schöpfung\", Bach's \"Christmas Oratorio\", and the Mozart Requiem. He was a regular soloist with the Münchener Bach-Chor conducted by Karl Richter, performing and recording Bach's cantatas and Passions.\n\nAdam was praised for his robust voice, intelligent interpretation and stage presence, and sometimes criticized for abrasive tone quality, unsteadiness, and wobble.\n\nAdam taught voice as honorary professor at the Musikhochschule Dresden from 1979.\n\nAdam died on 10 January 2019 in Dresden.\n\nAdam wrote books about his life, career, and perspective on opera:\n\n\n"}

The maneuver involves folding the first two joints of the fingers inward and striking with the fore-knuckles. It is used most often to strike at soft, vulnerable targets, such as the ribs, throat, inner arms and temples.\n\nThe fist is formed by folding the first two joints of the fingers. There are two variations of the maneuver; the first involves folding only the first four fingers of the hand. The second involves compressing the fist further by folding in the thumb as well to the side of the hand. The advantage of using the first is that it has a slightly longer reach and can be formed faster. The second variation's advantage is that it is more firm, reducing the risk of injury to a user's hand.\n\nThe nature of this strike allows for greater penetration against weak spots on an opponent's body, but presents a very real risk of self-injury should a user be careless while using it. The strike is, therefore, best used at close range, where it is easier to reach soft targets and where there doesn't need to be too much force behind the blow to deal significant damage. It is also recommended that users strike from angles when attacking with this fist, as this decreases the impact to one's hand whilst still maintaining the impact delivered to an opponent.\n\nThis strike is also a useful tool in self-defense where long fingernails may impede other strikes. With the leopard fist, fingernails do not usually get in the way when forming the fist. It also amplifies the damage done to an opponent by focusing the force of a punch over a much smaller surface area. Aside from striking with the metacarpals, the palm heel and the side of the hand may also be used against an opponent.\n\nThe strike is most prominently used in Leopard Kung Fu, but can also be found in certain styles of Karate, such as Kyokushin, Shotokan and Uechi-ryū (though they are rarely used), Kempo and in rare cases, Wing Chun. It is also sometimes used as the primary weapon of Choy Li Fut practitioners.\n\nThis form of strike can be used against any target, but is most commonly demonstrated as a strike to the throat, ribs, solar plexus, side of the stomach, kidneys, groin, bladder, back muscles, inner arms, jugular vein, side of the face, eyes, cheekbones, bridge of the nose, upper lip, jaw and temples.\n\nThe Leopard Blow is also the name of a special Dim Mak maneuver used by Lady Shiva, a comic book supervillain published by DC Comics.\n\nIn Detective Comics #443 published by DC Comics, a villain called the Enforcer uses \"an off-beat variation on the Leopard's Paw knuckle strike\" against Batman. Later, his \"overuse [of] that knuckle strike variation\" allows Batman to guess the Enforcer's true identity.\n\nThe Marvel Comics superhero known as Iron Fist uses this punch in the Netflix TV series of the same name.\n\n"}

{"id": "2223484", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2223484", "title": "Battle of Bicocca", "text": "Battle of Bicocca\n\nThe Battle of Bicocca or La Bicocca () was fought on 27 April 1522, during the Italian War of 1521–26. A combined French and Venetian force under Odet of Foix, Viscount of Lautrec, was decisively defeated by an Imperial–Spanish and Papal army under the overall command of Prospero Colonna. Lautrec then withdrew from Lombardy, leaving the Duchy of Milan in Imperial hands.\n\nHaving been driven from Milan by an Imperial advance in late 1521, Lautrec had regrouped, attempting to strike at Colonna's lines of communication. When the Swiss mercenaries in French service did not receive their pay, however, they demanded an immediate battle, and Lautrec was forced to attack Colonna's fortified position in the park of the Arcimboldi Villa Bicocca, north of Milan. The Swiss pikemen advanced over open fields under heavy artillery fire to assault the Imperial positions, but were halted at a sunken road backed by earthworks. Having suffered massive casualties from the fire of Spanish arquebusiers, the Swiss retreated. Meanwhile, an attempt by French cavalry to flank Colonna's position proved equally ineffective. The Swiss, unwilling to fight further, marched off to their cantons a few days later, and Lautrec retreated into Venetian territory with the remnants of his army.\n\nThe battle is noted chiefly for marking the end of the Swiss dominance among the infantry of the Italian Wars, and of the Swiss method of assaults by massed columns of pikemen without support from other troops. It was also one of the first engagements in which firearms played a decisive role on the battlefield.\n\nAt the start of the war in 1521, Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and Pope Leo X moved jointly against the Duchy of Milan, the principal French possession in Lombardy. A large Papal force under Federico II Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, together with Spanish troops from Naples and some smaller Italian contingents, concentrated near Mantua. The German forces which Charles sent south to aid this venture passed through Venetian territory near Valeggio unmolested; the combined Papal, Spanish, and Imperial army then proceeded into French territory under the command of Prospero Colonna. For the next several months, Colonna fought an evasive war of maneuver against Odet of Foix, Viscount of Lautrec, the French commander, besieging cities but refusing to give battle.\n\nBy the autumn of 1521, Lautrec, who was holding a line along the Adda river to Cremona, began to suffer massive losses from desertion, particularly among his Swiss mercenaries. Colonna took the opportunity this offered and, advancing close to the Alps, crossed the Adda at Vaprio; Lautrec, lacking infantry and assuming the year's campaign to be over, withdrew to Milan. Colonna had no intention of stopping his advance, however. On the night of November 23, he launched a surprise attack on the city, overwhelming the Venetian troops defending one of the walls. Following some abortive street-fighting, Lautrec withdrew to Cremona with about 12,000 men.\n\nBy January 1522, the French had lost Alessandria, Pavia, and Como; and Francesco II Sforza, bringing further German reinforcements, had slipped past a Venetian force at Bergamo to join Colonna in Milan. Lautrec had meanwhile been reinforced by the arrival of 16,000 fresh Swiss pikemen and some further Venetian forces, as well as additional companies of French troops under the command of Thomas de Foix-Lescun and Pedro Navarro; he had also secured the services of the condottiere Giovanni de' Medici, who brought his Black Bands into the French service. The French proceeded to attack Novara and Pavia, hoping to draw Colonna into a decisive battle. Colonna, leaving Milan, fortified himself in the monastery of Certosa south of the city. Considering this position to be too strong to be easily assaulted, Lautrec attempted instead to threaten Colonna's lines of communication by sweeping around Milan to Monza, cutting the roads from the city into the Alps.\n\nLautrec was suddenly confronted, however, with the intransigence of the Swiss, who formed the largest contingent of the French army. They complained that they had not received any of the pay promised them since their arrival in Lombardy. The Swiss captains, led by Albert von Stein, demanded that Lautrec attack the Imperial army immediately—else the mercenaries would abandon the French and return to their cantons. Lautrec reluctantly acquiesced and marched south towards Milan.\n\nColonna had meanwhile relocated to a formidable new position: the manor park of Bicocca, about four miles (6 km) north of Milan. The park was situated between a large expanse of marshy ground to the west and the main road into Milan to the east; along this road ran a deep wet ditch, which was crossed by a narrow stone bridge some distance south of the park. The north side of the park was bordered by a sunken road; Colonna deepened this and constructed an earthen rampart on the southern bank. The Imperial artillery, placed on several platforms jutting forward from the earthworks, was able to sweep the fields north of the park as well as parts of the sunken road itself. The entire length of the north side of the park was less than , which permitted Colonna to place his troops quite densely. Immediately behind the rampart were four ranks of Spanish arquebusiers, commanded by Fernando d'Avalos, Marquess of Pescara; they were backed by Spanish pikemen and German landsknechts under Georg Frundsberg. Most of the Imperial cavalry was placed at the south end of the park, far behind the infantry; a separate force of cavalry was positioned to the south, guarding the bridge.\n\nOn the evening of 26 April, Lautrec sent a force of about 400 cavalry under the Sieur de Pontdormy to reconnoiter the Imperial positions. The patrol reported that the ground was cut by irrigation ditches and ill-suited for maneuvering, but this failed to dissuade the Swiss. Colonna, having observed the French presence, sent messengers to Milan to request reinforcements; Francesco Sforza arrived the next morning with 6,400 additional troops, joining the cavalry near the bridge to the south of Colonna's camp.\n\nAt dawn on 27 April, Lautrec began his attack. The Black Bands brushed aside the Spanish pickets, clearing the ground before the Imperial positions. The French advance was headed by two columns of Swiss, each comprising about 4,000 to 7,000 men, accompanied by some artillery; this party was to assault the entrenched front of the Imperial camp directly. Lescun, meanwhile, led a body of cavalry south along the Milan road, intending to flank the camp and strike at the bridge to the rear. The remainder of the French army, including the French infantry, the bulk of the heavy cavalry, and the remnants of the Swiss, formed up in a broad line some distance behind the two Swiss columns; behind this was a third line, composed of the Venetian forces under Francesco Maria della Rovere, the Duke of Urbino.\n\nThe overall command of the Swiss assault was given to Anne de Montmorency. As the Swiss columns advanced towards the park, he ordered them to pause and wait for the French artillery to bombard the Imperial defences, but the Swiss refused to obey. Perhaps the Swiss captains doubted that the artillery would have any effect on the earthworks; historian Charles Oman suggests that it is more likely they were \"inspired by blind pugnacity and self-confidence\". In any case, the Swiss moved rapidly towards Colonna's position, leaving the artillery behind. There was apparently some rivalry between the two columns, as one, commanded by Arnold Winkelried of Unterwalden, was composed of men from the rural cantons, while the other, under Albert von Stein, consisted of the contingents from Bern and the urban cantons. The advancing Swiss quickly came into range of the Imperial artillery. Unable to take cover on the level fields, they began to take substantial casualties; as many as a thousand Swiss may have been killed by the time the columns reached the Imperial lines.\n\nThe Swiss came to a sudden halt as the columns reached the sunken road in front of the park; the depth of the road and the height of the rampart behind it—together higher than the length of the Swiss pikes—effectively blocked their advance. Moving down into the road, the Swiss suffered massive casualties from the fire of d'Avalos's arquebusiers. Nevertheless, the Swiss made a series of desperate attempts to breach the Imperial line. Some parties managed to reach the top of the rampart, only to be met by the landsknechts, who had come up from behind the arquebusiers. One of the Swiss captains was apparently killed by Frundsberg in single combat; and the Swiss, unable to form up atop the earthworks, were pushed back down into the sunken road. After attempting to move forward for about half an hour, the remnants of the Swiss columns retreated back towards the main French line. In the fields which they had crossed and before the rampart, they left more than 3,000 dead; among these were twenty-two captains, including both Winkelried and Albert von Stein. Of the French nobles who had accompanied the Swiss assault, only Montmorency survived.\n\nLescun, with about 400 heavy cavalry under his command, had meanwhile reached the bridge south of the park and fought his way across it and into the Imperial camp beyond. Colonna responded by detaching some cavalry under Antonio de Leyva to halt the French advance, while Francesco Sforza came up the road towards the bridge, aiming to surround Lescun. Pontdormy held off the Milanese, allowing Lescun to extricate himself from the camp; the French cavalry then retraced its path and rejoined the main body of the army.\n\nDespite the urging of d'Avalos and several other Imperial commanders, Colonna refused to order a general attack on the French, pointing out that much of Lautrec's army—including the bulk of his cavalry—was still intact. Colonna suggested that the French were already beaten, and would soon withdraw; this assessment was shared by Frundsberg. Nevertheless, some small groups of Spanish arquebusiers and light cavalry attempted to pursue the withdrawing Swiss, only to be beaten back by the Black Bands, which were covering the removal of the French artillery from the field.\n\nColonna's judgement proved to be accurate. The Swiss were unwilling to make another assault, and marched for home on 30 April. Lautrec, believing that his resulting weakness in infantry made a further campaign impossible, retreated to the east, crossing the Adda into Venetian territory at Trezzo. Having reached Cremona, Lautrec left Lescun in command of the remnants of the French army and rode unescorted to Lyon, to make his report to Francis I.\n\nLautrec's departure heralded a complete collapse of the French position in northern Italy. No longer menaced by the French army, Colonna and d'Avalos marched on Genoa, capturing it after a brief siege. Lescun, learning of the loss of Genoa, arranged an agreement with Francesco Sforza by which the Castello Sforzesco in Milan, which still remained in French hands, surrendered, and the remainder of the French forces withdrew over the Alps. The Venetians, under the newly elected Doge Andrea Gritti, were no longer interested in continuing the war; in July 1523, Gritti concluded the Treaty of Worms with Charles V, removing the Republic from the fighting. The French would make two further attempts to regain Lombardy before the end of the war, but neither would be successful; the terms of the Treaty of Madrid, which Francis was forced to sign after his defeat at the Battle of Pavia, would leave Italy in Imperial hands.\n\nAnother effect of the battle was the changed attitude of the Swiss. Francesco Guicciardini wrote of the aftermath of Bicocca: They went back to their mountains diminished in numbers, but much more diminished in audacity; for it is certain that the losses which they suffered at Bicocca so affected them that in the coming years they no longer displayed their wonted vigour. While Swiss mercenaries would continue to take part in the Italian Wars, they no longer possessed the willingness to make headlong attacks that they had at Novara in 1513 or Marignano in 1515; their performance at the Battle of Pavia in 1525 would surprise observers by its lack of initiative.\n\nMore generally, the battle made apparent the decisive role of small arms on the battlefield. Although the full capabilities of the arquebus would not be demonstrated until the Battle of the Sesia (where arquebusiers would prevail against heavy cavalry on open ground) two years later, the weapon nevertheless became a \"sine qua non\" for any army which did not wish to grant a massive advantage to its opponents. While the pikeman would continue to play a vital role in warfare, it would be equal to that of the arquebusier; together, the two types of infantry would be combined into the so-called \"pike and shot\" units that would endure until the development of the bayonet at the end of the seventeenth century. The offensive doctrine of the Swiss—a \"push of pike\" unsupported by firearms—had become obsolete. Indeed, offensive doctrines in general were increasingly replaced with defensive ones; the combination of the arquebus and effective field fortification had made frontal assaults on entrenched positions too costly to be practical, and they were not attempted again for the duration of the Italian Wars.\n\nAs a result of the battle, the word \"bicoca\"—meaning a bargain, or something acquired at little cost—entered the Spanish language.\n\n"}

{"id": "2223496", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2223496", "title": "Tannhäuser (opera)", "text": "Tannhäuser (opera)\n\nTannhäuser (; full title Tannhäuser und der Sängerkrieg auf Wartburg, \"Tannhäuser and the Minnesingers' Contest at Wartburg\") is an 1845 opera in three acts, music and text by Richard Wagner, (WWV 70 in the catalogue of the composer's works) based on two German legends: Tannhäuser, the mythologized medieval German Minnesänger and poet, and the tale of the Wartburg Song Contest. The story centers on the struggle between sacred and profane love, and redemption through love, a theme running through much of Wagner's mature work.\n\nThe opera remains a staple of major opera house repertoire in the 21st century.\n\nThe libretto of \"Tannhäuser\" combines mythological elements characteristic of German \"Romantische Oper\" (Romantic opera) and the medieval setting typical of many French Grand Operas. Wagner brings these two together by constructing a plot involving the 14th century Minnesingers and the myth of Venus and her subterranean realm of Venusberg. Both the historical and the mythological are united in Tannhäuser's personality; although he is a historical poet composer, little is known about him other than myths that surround him.\n\nWagner wove a variety of sources into the opera narrative. According to his autobiography, he was inspired by finding the story in \"a \"Volksbuch\" (popular book) about the Venusberg\", which he claimed \"fell into his hands\", although he admits knowing of the story from the \"Phantasus\" of Ludwig Tieck and E. T. A. Hoffmann's story, \"Der Kampf der Sänger\" (The Singers' Contest). Tieck's tale, which names the hero \"Tannenhäuser\", tells of the minnesinger-knight's amorous adventures in the Venusberg, his travels to Rome as a Pilgrim, and his repudiation by the pope. To this Wagner added material from Hoffmann's story, from \"Serapions-Brüder\" (1819), describing a song contest at the Wartburg castle, a castle which featured prominently in Thuringian history. Heinrich Heine had provided Wagner with the inspiration for \"Der fliegende Holländer\" and Wagner again drew on Heine for Tannhäuser. In Heine's sardonic essay \"Elementargeister\" (Elemental spirits), there appears a poem about Tannhäuser and the lure of the grotto of Venus, published in 1837 in the third volume of \"Der Salon\". Other possible sources include Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué's play \"Der Sängerkrieg auf der Wartburg\" and Eichendorff's \"Das Marmorbild\" (The Marble Statue, 1819).\n\nThe legend of Tannhäuser, the amorous crusading Franconian knight, and that of the song contest on the Wartburg (which did not involve Tannhäuser, but the semi-mythical minnesinger Heinrich von Ofterdingen), came from quite separate traditions. Ludwig Bechstein wove together the two legends in the first volume of his collection of Thuringian legends, \"Der Sagenschatz und die Sagenkreise des Thüringerlandes\" (A treasury of the tales of Thuringian legends and legend cycles, 1835), which was probably the \"Volksbuch\" to which Wagner refers to in his autobiography. Wagner also knew of the work of another contemporary, Christian Theodor Ludwig Lucas, whose \"Über den Krieg von Wartburg\" of 1838 also conflated the two legends. This confusion (which explains why Tannhäuser is referred to as 'Heinrich' in the opera) does not fit with the historical timeline of the events in the opera, since the Singers' Contest involving von Ofterdingen is said to have taken place around 1207, while Tannhäuser's poetry appeared much later (1245–1265). The sources used by Wagner therefore reflected a nineteenth century romantic view of the medieval period, with concerns about artistic freedom and the constraints of organised religion typical of the period of Romanticism.\n\nDuring Wagner's first stay in Paris (1839–1842) he read a paper by Ludwig Lucas on the \"Sängerkrieg\" which sparked his imagination, and encouraged him to return to Germany, which he reached on 7 April 1842. Having crossed the Rhine, the Wagners drove towards Thuringia, and saw the early rays of sun striking the Wartburg; Wagner immediately began to sketch the scenery that would become the stage sets. Wagner wrote the prose draft of \"Tannhäuser\" between June and July 1842 and the libretto in April 1843.\n\nWagner began composing the music during a vacation in Teplitz in the summer of 1843 and completed the full score on 13 April 1845; the opera's famous overture, often played separately as a concert piece, was written last. While composing the music for the Venusberg grotto, Wagner grew so impassioned that he made himself ill; in his autobiography, he wrote, \"With much pain and toil I sketched the first outlines of my music for the \"Venusberg\"... Meanwhile I was very much troubled by excitability and rushes of blood to the brain. I imagined I was ill and lay for whole days in bed...\" The instrumentation also shows signs of borrowing from French operatic style. The score includes parts for on-stage brass; however, rather than using French brass instruments, Wagner uses twelve German waldhorns. Wagner also makes use of the harp, another commonplace of French opera. \nWagner made a number of revisions of the opera throughout his life, and was still unsatisfied with its format when he died. The most significant revision was made for the opera's premiere in Paris in 1861.\n\nThe first performance was given in the \"Königliches Hoftheater\" (Royal Theater) in Dresden on 19 October 1845. The composer Ferdinand Hiller, at that time a friend of the composer, assisted in the musical preparations for the production. The part of Elisabeth was sung by Wagner's niece Johanna Wagner. Wagner had intended to premiere the opera on 13 October, Johanna's 19th birthday, but she was ill, so it was postponed by six days. Venus was created by Wilhelmine Schröder-Devrient, and the title role was taken by Josef Tichatschek. The performance was conducted by the composer. \"Tannhäuser\" was not the success that \"Rienzi\" had been, and Wagner almost immediately set to modifying the ending, adjusting the score through 1846 and 1847. For the first Dresden revival (1847) he clarified the representation of Venus's temptation of Tannhäuser in the final act, and adding vocal presentation of the pilgrim's chorus in this act (where it had previously been represented by orchestra alone). This version of the opera, as revised for publication in 1860, is generally known as the \"Dresden\" version. After Franz Liszt produced the opera at Weimar Court Theatre in 1849, there were further performances between 1852 and 1856 in (amongst other locations) Schwerin, Kassel, Posen, Wiesbaden, Hanover, Munich and Berlin.\n\nThe Dresden version was also used for initial productions outside Germany, notably at Riga on 18 January 1853; at Tallinn on 10 January 1854; at Prague on 25 November 1854 at Theatre of the Estates; at New York City on 4 April 1859 at the Stadt Theatre; and in London on 6 May 1876 at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden (when it was sung in Italian).\n\nWagner substantially amended the opera for a special 1861 performance by the Paris Opéra. This had been requested by Emperor Napoleon III at the suggestion of Princess Pauline von Metternich, wife of the Austrian ambassador to France. This revision forms the basis of what is now known as the \"Paris version\" of \"Tannhäuser\". The venue meant that the composer had to insert a ballet into the score, according to the traditions of the house. Wagner agreed to this condition since he believed that a success at the Opéra represented his most significant opportunity to re-establish himself following his exile from Germany. However, rather than put the ballet in its traditional place in Act II, he chose to place it in Act I, in the form of a bacchanale, where it could make dramatic sense by representing the sensual world of Venus's realm. There were further extensive changes. The text was translated into French (by Charles-Louis-Etienne Nuitter and others). Venus, a role that in the Dresden version was considered a soprano, was rewritten as for mezzo-soprano. Venus' aria \"Geliebter, komm!\" was transposed down by a semitone, and its latter part was completely rewritten. A solo for Walther was removed from Act 2. Extra lines for Venus following Tannhäuser's \"Hymn to Love\" were added. The orchestral introduction to Act 3 was shortened. The end of the opera was reworked to include Venus on stage, where before the audience only heard the Venus motif, in an attempt to clarify the action.\n\n\"Tannhäuser\"s first performance in Paris was given on 13 March 1861 at the Salle Le Peletier of the Paris Opéra. The composer had been closely involved in its preparation and there had been 164 rehearsals. The costumes were designed by Alfred Albert, the sets by Charles-Antoine Cambon and Joseph Thierry (Act I, scene 1), Édouard Desplechin (Act I, scene 2 and Act III), and Joseph Nolau and Auguste Alfred Rubé (Act II).\n\nAt the first performance the opera was initially well-received, with disturbances including whistling and cat-calls beginning to appear in Act II, and becoming prominent by the end of the third act. For the second performance much of the new ballet music was removed, together with some actions that had specifically provoked mockery, such as the piping of the shepherd in Act I. At this performance however the audience disturbances were increased. This was partly due to members of the wealthy and aristocratic Jockey Club, who objected to the ballet coming in Act I, since this meant they would have to be present from the beginning of the performance (disrupting their dining schedule). It was alleged that they distributed whistles to the audience. A further incentive to disruption was the unpopularity of Princess von Metternich and of her native country of Austria. At the third performance on 24 March (which Wagner did not attend) uproar caused several interruptions of up to fifteen minutes at a time. As a consequence, Wagner withdrew the opera after the third performance. This marked the end to Wagner's hopes of establishing himself in Paris.\n\nThe first performance outside France of the \"Paris\" version was given in Bologna on 7 November 1872 at the Teatro Comunale, (the first performance of the opera in Italy). The American and British premieres of this version were respectively in New York at the Metropolitan Opera on 30 January 1889, and at London's Royal Opera House on 15 July 1895 .\n\nA few further changes to \"Tannhäuser\" were made for an 1875 performance of the opera in Vienna, the last production carried out under Wagner's own supervision. These included linking the end of the overture to the start of the opera proper. The 1875 Vienna version is that normally used in modern productions of the \"Paris\" version, often with the reinstatement of Walther's Act 2 solo. Wagner remained unsatisfied with the opera. His wife Cosima noted in her diary on 23 January 1883 (three weeks before he died) \"He says he still owes the world \"Tannhäuser\".\"\n\nAlthough the libretto and the score always use the single name \"Tannhäuser\" in stage directions involving the title character or in indicating which passages are sung by him, that name never appears as part of the lyrics. Rather, each character who addresses Tannhäuser by name uses his given name \"Heinrich\" (Heinrich von Ofterdingen).\n\nThe distinct character Heinrich der Schreiber sings many melodies distinct from all other named characters, and occasionally unique lyrics. However, in the libretto he finds individual mention only in the list of characters, with the ensemble numbers that include him being labelled for the \"Ritter\" (i.e., \"knights\", referring to the \"Minnesinger\", who all share knightly rank). The score in the Schirmer edition labels his melody line simply \"Schreiber\".\n\n\"Tannhäuser\" is scored for the following instruments:\n\n\n\"on-stage\"\n\nIn Eisenach, Germany, in the early 13th century, the landgraves of the Thuringian Valley ruled the area of Germany around the Wartburg. They were great patrons of the arts, particularly music and poetry, holding contests between the minnesingers at the Wartburg. Across the valley towered the Venusberg, in whose interior, according to legend, dwelt Holda, the Goddess of Spring. In time, Holda became identified with Venus, the pagan Goddess of Love, whose grotto was the home of sirens and nymphs. It was said that the Goddess would lure the Wartburg minnesinger-knights to her lair where her beauty would captivate them. The minnesinger-knight Heinrich von Ofterdingen, known as Tannhäuser, left the court of the Landgrave of Thuringia a year ago after a disagreement with his fellow knights. Since then he has been held as a willing captive through his love for Venus, in her grotto in the Venusberg.\n\nThe substantial overture commences with the theme of the 'Pilgrim's Chorus' from Act 3, Scene 1, and also includes elements of the 'Venusberg' music from Act 1, Scene 1. The overture is frequently performed as a separate item in orchestral concerts, the first such performance having been given by Felix Mendelssohn conducting the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra in February 1846. Wagner later gave the opinion that perhaps it would be better to cut the overture at opera performances to the Pilgrim's Chorus alone – \"the remainder – in the fortunate event of its being understood – is, as a prelude to the drama, too much; in the opposite event, too little.\" In the original, \"Dresden\" version, the overture comes to a traditional concert close (the version heard in concert performances). For the \"Paris\" version the music leads directly into the first scene, without pausing.\n\n\"The Venusberg, (the Hörselberg of \"Frau Holda\" in Thuringia, in the vicinity of Eisenach)\", and a valley between the Venusberg and Wartburg\n\nScene 1. Wagner's stage directions state: \"The stage represents the interior of the Venusberg...In the distant background is a bluish lake; in it one sees the bathing figures of naiads; on its elevated banks are sirens. In the extreme left foreground lies Venus bearing the head of the half kneeling Tannhäuser in her lap. The whole cave is illuminated by rosy light. – A group of dancing nymphs appears, joined gradually by members of loving couples from the cave. – A train of Bacchantes comes from the background in wild dance... – The ever-wilder dance answers as in echo the Chorus of Sirens\": \"Naht euch dem Strande\" (Come to the shore). In the \"Paris\" version this orgiastic ballet is greatly extended.\n\nScene 2. Following the orgy of the ballet, Tannhäuser's desires are finally satiated, and he longs for freedom, spring and the sound of church bells. He takes up his harp and pays homage to the goddess in a passionate love song, \"Dir töne Lob!\" (Let your praises be heard), which he ends with an earnest plea to be allowed to depart, \"Aus deinem Reiche, muss ich fliehn! O Königin! Göttin! Lass mich ziehn!\" (From your kingdom must I flee! O Queen! O Goddess, set me free). Surprised, Venus offers him further charms, but eventually his repeated pleas arouse her fury and she curses his desire for salvation. (In the \"Paris\" version Venus's inveighing against Tannhäuser is significantly expanded). Eventually Tannhäuser declares: \"Mein Heil ruht in Maria\" (My salvation rests in Mary). These words break the unholy spell. Venus and the Venusberg disappear.\n\nScene 3. According to Wagner's stage directions, \"Tannhäuser...finds himself a beautiful valley… To the left one sees the Hörselberg. To the right...a mountain path from the direction of the Wartburg ...; in the foreground, led to by a low promontory, an image of the Virgin Mary – From above left one hears the ringing of herder’s bells; on a high projection sits a young shepherd with pipes facing the valley\". It is May. The shepherd sings an ode to the pagan goddess Holda, \"Frau Holda kam aus dem Berg hervor\" (Lady Holda, come forth from the hill). A hymn \"Zu dir wall ich, mein Jesus Christ\" (To thee I turn, my Jesus Christ) can be heard, as Pilgrims are seen approaching from the Wartburg, and the shepherd stops playing. The pilgrims pass Tannhäuser as he stands motionless, and then, praising God, (\"Allmächt'ger, dir sei Preis!\" (Almighty God, to you be praise!)) he sinks to his knees, overcome with gratitude. At that moment the sound of hunting-horns can be heard, drawing ever nearer.\n\nScene 4. The Landgrave's hunting party appears. The minnesingers (Wolfram, Walther, Biterolf, Reinmar, and Heinrich) recognise Tannhäuser, still deep in prayer, and greet him (\"Heinrich! Heinrich! Seh ich recht?\" (Heinrich! Heinrich! Do I see right?)) cautiously, recalling past feuds. They question him about his recent whereabouts, to which he gives vague answers. The minnesingers urge Tannhäuser to rejoin them, which he declines until Wolfram mentions Elisabeth, the Landgrave's niece, \"Bleib bei Elisabeth!\" (Stay, for Elisabeth!). Tannhäuser is visibly moved, \"Elisabeth! O Macht des Himmels, rufst du den süsssen Namen mir?\" (Elisabeth! O might of heaven, is it you that wakes me with that sweet name?). The minnesingers explain to Tannhäuser how he had enchanted Elisabeth, but when he had left she withdrew from their company and lost interest in music, expressing the hope that his return will also bring her back, \"Auf's Neue leuchte uns ihr Stern!\" (Let her star once more shine upon us). Tannhäuser begs them to lead him to her, \"Zu ihr! Zu ihr!\" (To her! To her!). The rest of the hunting party gathers, blowing horns.\n\n\"The minnesingers' hall in the Wartburg castle\"\n\nIntroduction – Scene 1. Elisabeth enters, joyfully. She sings, to the hall, of how she has been beset by sadness since Tannhäuser's departure but now lives in hope that his songs will revive both of them, \"Dich, teure Halle, grüss ich wieder\" (Dear hall, I greet thee once again). Wolfram leads Tannhäuser into the hall.\n\nScene 2. Tannhäuser flings himself at Elisabeth's feet. He exclaims \"O Fürstin!\" (O Princess!). At first, seemingly confused, she questions him about where he has been, which he avoids answering. She then greets him joyfully (\"Ich preise dieses Wunder aus meines Herzens Tiefe!\" (I praise this miracle from my heart's depths!)), and they join in a duet, \"Gepriesen sei die Stunde\" (Praise be to this hour). Tannhäuser then leaves with Wolfram.\n\nScene 3. The Landgrave enters, and he and Elisabeth embrace. The Landgrave sings of his joy, \"Dich treff ich hier in dieser Halle\" (Do I find you in this hall) at her recovery and announces the upcoming song contest, at which she will preside, \"dass du des Festes Fürstin seist\" (that you will be the Princess of the Festival).\n\nScene 4 and \"Sängerkrieg\" (Song Contest). Elisabeth and the Landgrave watch the guests arrive. The guests assemble greeting the Landgrave and singing \"Freudig begrüssen wir edle Halle\" (With joy we greet the noble hall), take their places in a semicircle, with Elisabeth and the Landgrave in the seats of honour in the foreground. The Landgrave announces the contest and the theme, which shall be \"Könnt ihr der Liebe Wesen mir ergründen?\" (Can you explain the nature of Love?), and that the prize will be whatever the winner asks of Elisabeth. The knights place their names in a cup from which Elisabeth draws the first singer, Wolfram. Wolfram sings a trite song of courtly love and is applauded, but Tannhäuser chides him for his lack of passion. There is consternation, and once again Elisabeth appears confused, torn between rapture and anxiety. Biterolf accuses him of blasphemy and speaks of \"Frauenehr und hohe Tugend\" (women's virtue and honour). The knights draw their swords as Tannhäuser mocks Biterolf, but the Landgrave intervenes to restore order. However, Tannhäuser, as if in a trance, rises to his feet and sings a song of ecstatic love to Venus, \"Dir Göttin der Liebe, soll mein Lied ertönen\" (To thee, Goddess of Love, will my song be raised). There is general horror as it is realised he has been in the Venusberg; the women, apart from Elisabeth, flee. She appears pale and shocked, while the knights and the Landgrave gather together and condemn Tannhäuser to death. Only Elisabeth, shielding him with her body, saves him, \"Haltet ein!\" (Stop!). She states that God's will is that a sinner shall achieve salvation through atonement. Tannhäuser collapses as all hail Elisabeth as an angel, \"Ein Engel stieg aus lichtem Äther\" (An angel comes to us from the realm of light). He promises to seek atonement, the Landgrave exiles him and orders him to join another younger band of pilgrims then assembling. All depart, crying \"Nach Rom!\" (To Rome!).\n\nIn the \"Paris\" version, the song contest is somewhat shortened, possibly because of the lack of suitable soloists for the Paris production.\n\n\"The valley of the Wartburg, in autumn. Elisabeth is kneeling, praying before the Virgin as Wolfram comes down the path and notices her\"\n\nScene 1. Orchestral music describes the pilgrimage of Tannhäuser. It is evening. Wolfram muses on Elisabeth's sorrow during Tannhäuser's second absence, \"Wohl wusst' ich hier sie im Gebet zu finden\" (I knew well I might find her here in prayer) and her longing for the return of the pilgrims, and expresses concerns that he may not have been absolved. As he does so he hears a pilgrims' prayer in the distance, \"Beglückt darf nun dich, O Heimat, ich schauen\" (Joyfully now my homeland I behold). Elisabeth rises and she and Wolfram listen to the hymn, watching the pilgrims approach and pass by. She anxiously searches the procession, but in vain, realising sorrowfully he is not amongst them, \"Er kehret nicht züruck!\" (He has not returned). She again kneels with a prayer to the Virgin that appears to foretell her death, \"Allmächt'ge Jungfrau! Hör mein Flehen\" (Almighty Virgin, hear my plea!). On rising she sees Wolfram but motions him not to speak. He offers to escort her back to the Wartburg, but she again motions him to be still, and gestures that she is grateful for his devotion but her path leads to heaven. She slowly makes her way up the path alone.\n\nScene 2. Wolfram, left alone as darkness draws on and the stars appear, begins to play and sings a hymn to the evening star that also hints at Elisabeth's approaching death, \"Wie Todesahnung Dämmrung deckt die Lande...O du mein holder Abendstern\" (Like a premonition of death the twilight shrouds the earth... O thou my fair evening star).\n\nScene 3. It is now night. Tannhäuser appears, ragged, pale and haggard, walking feebly leaning on his staff. Wolfram suddenly recognises Tannhäuser, and startled challenges him, since he is exiled. To Wolfram's horror, Tannhäuser explains he is once again seeking the company of Venus. Wolfram tries to restrain him, at the same time expressing compassion and begging him to tell the story of his pilgrimage. Tannhäuser urges Wolfram to listen to his story, \"Nun denn, hör an! Du, Wolfram, du sollst es erfahren\" (Now then, listen! You, Wolfram, shall learn all that has passed). Tannhäuser sings of his penitence and suffering, all the time thinking of Elisabeth's gesture and pain, \"Inbrunst im Herzen, wie kein Büsser noch\" (With a flame in my heart, such as no penitent has known). He explains how he reached Rome, and the \"Heiligtumes Schwelle\" (Holy shrine), and witnessed thousands of pilgrims being absolved. Finally he approaches \"ihn, durch den sich Gott verkündigt'\" (he, through whom God speaks) and tells his story. However, rather than finding absolution, he is cursed, \"bist nun ewig du verdammt!\" (you are forever damned!), and is told by the pope that \"Wie dieser Stab in meiner Hand, nie mehr sich schmückt mit frischem Grün, kann aus der Hölle heissem Brand, Erlösung nimmer dir erblühn!\" (As this staff in my hand, no more shall bear fresh leaves, from the hot fires of hell, salvation never shall bloom for thee). Whereupon, absolutely crushed, he fled, seeking his former source of bliss.\n\nHaving completed his tale, Tannhäuser calls out to Venus to take him back, \"Zu dir, Frau Venus, kehr ich wieder\" (To you, Lady Venus, I return). The two men struggle as a faint image of dancing becomes apparent. As Tannhäuser repeatedly calls on Venus, she suddenly appears and welcomes him back, \"Willkommen, ungetreuer Mann!\" (Welcome, faithless man!). As Venus continues to beckon, \"Zu mir! Zu mir!\" (To me!, To me!), in desperation, Wolfram suddenly remembers there is one word that can change Tannhäuser's heart, and exclaims \"Elisabeth!\" Tannhäuser, as if frozen in time, repeats the name. As he does so, torches are seen, and a funeral hymn is heard approaching, \"Der Seele Heil, die nun entflohn\" (Hail, the soul that now is flown). Wolfram realises it must be Elisabeth's body that is being borne, and that in her death lies Tannhäuser's redemption, \"Heinrich, du bist erlöst!\" (Heinrich, you are saved). Venus cries out, \"Weh! Mir verloren\" (Alas! Lost to me!) and vanishes with her kingdom. As dawn breaks the procession appears bearing Elisabeth's body on a bier. Wolfram beckons to them to set it down, and as Tannhäuser bends over the body uttering, \"Heilige Elisabeth, bitte für mich!\" (Holy Elisabeth!, pray for me!) he dies. As the growing light bathes the scene the younger pilgrims arrive bearing the pope's staff sprouting new leaves, and proclaiming a miracle, \"Heil! Heil! Der Gnade Wunder Heil!\" (Hail!, Hail! To this miracle of grace, Hail!). All then sing \"Der Gnade Heil ist dem Büsser beschieden, er geht nun ein in der Seligen Frieden!\" (The Holy Grace of God is to the penitent given, who now enters into the joy of Heaven!).\n\nWagner died in 1883. The first production of the opera at Wagner's Bayreuth Festspielhaus (originally constructed for the performance of his Ring Cycle), was undertaken under the supervision of Cosima in 1891, and adhered closely to the 'Vienna' version. Later performances at Bayreuth included one conducted by Richard Strauss (1894), and one where the Bacchanal was choreographed by Isadora Duncan (1904). Duncan envisaged the Bacchanal as a fantasy of Tannhäuser's fevered brain, as Wagner had written to Mathilde Wesendonck in 1860. Arturo Toscanini conducted the opera at Bayreuth in the 1930/31 season.\n\nIn the words of the Wagner scholar Thomas S. Grey, \"The Bacchanal remained a defining focus of many ...productions, as a proving ground for changing conceptions of the psychosexual symbolism of the Venusberg.\" Productions including those of Götz Friedrich at Bayreuth (1972) and Otto Schenk at the Metropolitan Opera, New York, (1977) \"routinely offer quantities of simulated copulation and post-coital langour, for which the Paris score offers ample encouragement\". A Munich production (1994) included as part of Tannhäuser's fantasies \"creatures out of Hieronymus Bosch crawl[ing] around the oblivious protagonist\".\n\nThe Operabase website indicates that in the two calendar years 2014/2015, there were 163 performances of 41 productions of \"Tannhäuser\" in 30 cities throughout the world.\n\nMany scholars and writers on opera have advanced theories to explain the motives and behaviour of the characters, including Jungian psychoanalysis, in particular as regards Tannhäuser's apparently self-destructive behaviour. In 2014 an analysis suggested that his apparently inconsistent behaviour, when analysed by game theory, is actually consistent with a redemption strategy. Only by public disclosure can Tannhäuser force a resolution of his inner conflict.\n\nCitations\nSources\n\n"}

During the year, Union forces captured the Confederate cities of Vicksburg and Port Hudson, giving them complete control over the Mississippi River, while forcing Confederates out of the North following the Battle of Gettysburg.\n\nIn the Eastern theater, the Union Army of the Potomac, commanded by Major General Joseph Hooker, attacked the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia commanded by General Robert E. Lee in the Battle of Chancellorsville. Hooker planned to moved most of his army around to the Confederates's rear before Lee could react and force Lee to retreat but the Union army was slowed and then stopped by a small Confederate force, which was reinforced by the rest of the Confederate army. Lee then sent a flanking column led by Thomas J. Jackson around Hooker's left, which attacked a few hours before sunset on May 2; this attack and further Confederate attacks the following day forced Hooker to retreat on May 6. During the battle, Jackson was wounded by friendly fire and died several days later. Lee reorganized his army following the campaign and launched an invasion of Union territory in June, moving through the Shenandoah Valley into Pennsylvania; Hooker was relieved of command on June 29, due to continuous disputes with the government over the garrison of Harpers Ferry, and replaced by Major General George Meade. During the Battle of Gettysburg from July 1 to July 3, Meade successfully held off Lee's attacks while inflicting heavy casualties in return. Lee was forced to retreat back to Virginia; Meade followed in close pursuit but was unable to find an opportunity to completely crush the Confederate army. In October, Lee attempted to isolate and destroy Meade during the Bristoe Campaign but failed in an attack on Union positions at the Battle of Bristoe Station on October 14. Pressed by Union authorities, Meade also tried to attack Lee's positions along the Mine Run; however, Lee was able to establish a fortified defensive line across the Union line of advance. Meade judged the Confederate position too strong to attack and retreated.\nIn the Western Theater, simultaneous Union offensives from northern Mississippi and eastern Louisiana resulted in the sieges of Vicksburg and Port Hudson, both along the Mississippi River. Ulysses S. Grant started the Vicksburg campaign near the end of April when he crossed the Mississippi River near Bruinsburg Landing, south of Grand Gulf. He then marched inland and captured the Mississippi state capital of Jackson before turning east to Vicksburg; this isolated the Confederate garrison from Confederate supplies and reinforcements. After a six-week siege, the Confederate garrison surrendered on July 4, followed by the surrender of Port Hudson on July 9; this resulted in the complete Union control of the Mississippi River and made Grant a hero in the North. In central Tennessee, the Union Army of the Cumberland commanded by Major General William S. Rosecrans maneuvered the Confederate Army of Tennessee, commanded by General Braxton Bragg, towards Chattanooga, Tennessee during the Tullahoma Campaign from late June to early July. In early September, Rosecrans launched another offensive which resulted in the capture of Chattanooga, an important Confederate rail center; however, a few weeks later Bragg, reinforced with James Longstreet's corps from the Army of Northern Virginia, attacked Rosecrans near the Chickamauga Creek and routed much of the Union army, forcing it to retreat back to Chattanooga. Stubborn resistance from the troops of George H. Thomas prevented the Confederates from launching an immediate pursuit. Bragg settled his army into a siege of Chattanooga, almost completely cutting off all supplies to the Union army. Soon, dissension and arguments began to create tension in the Confederate army's high command; this resulted in Longstreet being sent to eastern Tennessee and a reorganization of the army in an attempt by Bragg to rid the army of his critics. Grant, promoted to command of the Military Division of the Mississippi, took command of the Union forces near the city, which was reinforced by the Army of the Tennessee and a detachment from the Army of the Potomac. During the three days from November 23 to the 26, Grant launched a series of attacks on the Confederate positions and was able to drive off Bragg's army. A rear guard action by Patrick Cleaburne at Ringgold Gap halted the Union pursuit long enough for Bragg to reach safety. A few weeks after the battle, Bragg was relieved of command by his own request.\n\nIn the Trans-Mississippi Theater, only small battles and skirmishes took place. On January 1, Confederate forces led by Major General John B. Magruder recaptured the port city of Galveston, the only port city which the Confederates were able to recapture during the war. In order to cut off the Trans-Mississippi supply lines to Port Hudson, Major General Nathaniel P. Banks moved up the Bayou Teche in Louisiana during April. For the remainder of the summer, Confederate commander Major General Richard Taylor attempted to cut off Banks' supply lines to New Orleans but failed. In September, Union forces tried to invade eastern Texas to counteract the French invasion of Mexico but were defeated at Sabine Pass, losing two gunboats and 350 men while the Confederates suffered no casualties.\n\n\n"}

Its unit is kilogram per second in SI units, and slug per second or pound per second in US customary units. The common symbol is formula_1 (ṁ, pronounced \"m-dot\"), although sometimes \"μ\" (Greek lowercase mu) is used.\n\nSometimes, mass flow rate is termed \"mass flux\" or \"mass current\", see for example \"Fluid Mechanics, Schaum's et al\". In this article, the (more intuitive) definition is used.\n\nMass flow rate is defined by the limit:\n\nThe reason for the dot product is as follows. The only mass flowing \"through\" the cross-section is the amount normal to the area, i.e. parallel to the unit normal. This amount is: \nwhere \"θ\" is the angle between the unit normal formula_4 and the velocity of mass elements. The amount passing through the cross-section is reduced by the factor formula_5, as \"θ\" increases less mass passes through. All mass which passes in tangential directions to the area, that is perpendicular to the unit normal, \"doesn't\" actually pass \"through\" the area, so the mass passing through the area is zero. This occurs when \"θ\" = \"π\"/2:\nThese results are equivalent to the equation containing the dot product. Sometimes these equations are used to define the mass flow rate.\n\nConsidering flow through porous media, a special quantity, superficial mass flow rate, can be introduced. It is related with superficial velocity, v, with the following relationship:\nThe quantity can be used in particle Reynolds number or mass transfer coefficient calculation for fixed and fluidized bed systems.\n\nIn the elementary form of the continuity equation for mass, in hydrodynamics:\n\nIn elementary classical mechanics, mass flow rate is encountered when dealing with objects of variable mass, such as a rocket ejecting spent fuel. Often, descriptions of such objects erroneously invoke Newton's second law F =d(\"m\"v)/d\"t\" by treating both the mass \"m\" and the velocity v as time-dependent and then applying the derivative product rule.

Created by the California Wilderness Act of 1984, it is located in the Sierra Nevada mountains west of Lake Tahoe in California, USA.\nIt is managed by the US Forest Service Tahoe National Forest. Elevations range from to at the summit of Granite Chief.\n\nEvents such as the Western States Endurance Run and the equestrian Western States Trail Ride, (popularly called The Tevis Cup) cross portions of the wilderness. The Pacific Crest Trail also passes through along the east edge of the wilderness.\n\nThis region is extensively glaciated and has features such as hanging valleys, cirques and U-shaped valleys, but few lakes. Just outside the wilderness boundary there are two large recreation reservoirs, Hell Hole Reservoir to the south and French Meadows Reservoir to the west.\n\nThe Sierra Club had maintained the Bradley Hut, which was a ski hut located at the Five Lakes Basin, but in 1994 the Sierra Club was asked to remove the hut by the U. S. Forest Service as it was now inside the newly created wilderness. The hut was dismantled and relocated four miles (6 km) away. Because no mechanical equipment can be used in a wilderness, the dismantling of the Bradley Hut took until the fall of 1996 to finish.\n\nThe principal drainages are the Middle Fork of the American River and Five Lakes Creek. The small lakes within the wilderness boundary are the Five Lakes, Mildred Lake and Little Needle Lake.\n\nFish such as rainbow, brook and brown trout can be seen in Whiskey, Picayune, and Bear Pen creeks as well as the largest lake of the Five Lakes group.\n\nRich, volcanic soils support a range of plant life, from fields of mule ears to conifer forests including whitebark pine at the highest elevations. Along the creeks grow black cottonwood, alder and aspen.\n\nThe three bracted onion (\"Allium tribracteatum\") is a native perennial bulb endemic to California. The California Native Plant Society lists the three bracted onion as \" rare, threatened, or endangered ... \" and there are only 10 counties with either specimens obtained or a verified observation made. Near the North Forth American River is Whitney's milk vetch (\"Astragalus whitneyi\" var. \"lenophyllus\").\nTypical of the high Sierra Nevada Mountains, the wildlife include mountain lion, black bear, and mule deer.\n\nGranite Chief wilderness provides important fawning areas for mule deer, so visitors are prohibited from bringing dogs into certain areas of the wilderness from May 15 to July 15.\n\nActivities include day-hiking, backpacking, fishing, cross-country skiing, mountain climbing and horsepacking. The Five Lakes basin is the most heavily used area in the wilderness due to the close proximity to both Squaw Valley and Alpine Meadows ski areas. Two commercial outfitters offer horsepacking trips into the wilderness.\n\nThere are of trails with eight trailheads.

ALCo had previously partnered with GE and Ingersoll-Rand to produce the first successful line of diesel-electric switch engines from 1924 to 1928. In forming the Alco-GE partnership, GE sought to expand the market for their electrical equipment after EMD started producing their own while ALCo gained GE's support in terms of marketing and service infrastructure, areas in which EMD had a formidable advantage.\n\nNotable locomotives produced by Alco-GE were the RS-1, the first road switcher, and UP 50, a prototype gas turbine-electric locomotive.\n\nAlco-GE attained a 26% share of the market for diesel locomotives as of 1946, mainly for switching and short-haul applications, but they could not crack EMD's dominant position in mainline locomotives. Alco's development of higher powered engines for such locomotives had not been satisfactory and EMD's introduction of the GP7 road-switcher in 1949 threatened Alco-GE's position in their most advantageous market.\n\nGE dissolved the partnership in 1953 to develop and build their own locomotives. Alco still received electrical gear from GE, but only as a customer and not a corporate partner.

He was a member of the Merovingian dynasty, and was installed by Charles Martel, a contender for the office of mayor of the palace, in opposition to Chilperic II, whose rule was thereby restricted to Neustria. This marked the first time since 679 that the kingdom of the Franks was divided. Following Chlothar's death, it was reunited under Chilperic.\n\nChlothar's parentage and the exact dates of his reign are uncertain, since no primary source gives them explicitly. Documents from Chlothar's reign place him on the throne between 28 June 717 and 24 February 718. A Frankish king-list from the reign of Charles the Bald a century and a half later gives his reign a length of one year, which is consistent with all other evidence. His reign began no earlier than 21 March 717 and was over by 18 May 718. Although it has been suggested that he was not a true Merovingian but a puppet king of convenience, this is unlikely, since it was the need for Merovingian legitimacy that compelled Charles Martel to name a rival king in the first place. Chlothar's father must have been either Theuderic III (died 691), in which case he was about 35 years old when he came to the throne, or Childebert III (died 711), in which case he was probably closer to 20.\n\nChlothar was made king at the instigation of Charles Martel following his victory over the forces of Chilperic II and the mayor of the palace, Ragamfred, at the Battle of Vincy on 21 March 717. This put Charles in control of most of Austrasia, although pockets still recognised Chilperic. The creation of a rival king in Chlothar IV served two goals: it legitimised Charles as mayor of the palace, an office which he claimed as an inheritance from his father, Pippin of Herstal, and it expanded his military resources by allowing him to raise a larger army through royal summons and the royal power to command.\n\nFollowing Chlothar's elevation, Chilperic and Ragamfred allied with Duke Odo of Aquitaine. In early 718, Charles led an army in Chlothar's name against the Neustrians and Aquitanians, whom he defeated at the Battle of Soissons, forcing Chilperic II to flee to Aquitaine and Duke Odo's protection. He then led the same army deep into Saxony, as far as the river Weser.\n\nThe \"Lex Alamannorum\", a law code for the Alamanni, was promulgated during Chlothar's reign and in his name. One of the three manuscripts groups of the \"Lex Alamannorum\" is called the \"Lex Alamannorum Hlotharii\" because of its invocation of Chlothar.\n\nThe \"Liber Historiae Francorum\" seems to imply that Chlothar died in 719. It is more likely that he died in 718 between 24 February, the date of his last known act, and 18 May, when Wissembourg Abbey, which was loyal to Charles Martel and dated its charters by the reign of Chlothar IV, switched to dating them by Chilperic II. Charles's pursuit of Chilperic, which culminated in a negotiated settlement with Odo for the king's return, was probably required by the sudden death of Chlothar IV. It has even been suggested that the suddenness of his death is suspicious, indicating perhaps that Charles had him removed—as soon as he no longer need him—in favour of the more legitimate Chilperic. No primary sources casts any suspicion, however.\n"}

{"id": "2223581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2223581", "title": "Ken Phelps", "text": "Ken Phelps\n\nKenneth Allan Phelps (born August 6, 1954) is an American former professional baseball designated hitter and first baseman. He played for six different Major League Baseball (MLB) teams from 1980 to 1990, primarily with the Seattle Mariners. Baseball statistician Bill James cited Phelps as an example of a player who is unfairly denied a chance to play in the majors, despite compiling strong minor league statistics.\nBorn and raised in Seattle, Washington, Phelps graduated from Ingraham High School in north Seattle in 1972. He played a year at Washington State in Pullman under Bobo Brayton, then headed south to Arizona to Mesa Community College, looking for an opportunity to play at Arizona State in Tempe.\n\nIn his only season at MCC in 1974, Phelps was named a junior college All-American. He was drafted twice in the first round (January and June drafts) by the New York Yankees and Philadelphia Phillies, respectively. He had previously been drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the eighth round out of high school in 1972.\n\nAll this earned Phelps a chance from Coach Jim Brock to play at ASU, where he was named to the College World Series All Star team in 1976, when the Sun Devils lost to rival Arizona after having defeated the Wildcats seven times that season, including a first-round game in Omaha.\n\nThe left-hitting first baseman was selected by the Kansas City Royals in the fifteenth round of the 1976 baseball amateur draft. Phelps hit a combined 43 home runs from for the Omaha Royals, KC's Triple-A affiliate in the American Association. The Royals traded him to the Montreal Expos prior to 1982 season for pitcher Grant Jackson. In the American Association in 1982, Phelps hit .333 with 46 home runs and 141 RBI for the Wichita Aeros. He had only eight major league at-bats that year, as there was no room on a very talented Montreal roster for Phelps to break in. Instead, Phelps' hometown club, Seattle, purchased him from the Expos after the 1982 season.\n\nAn average defensive player, Phelps was better suited to play with Seattle in the American League, as he could serve as the designated hitter, and the struggling franchise also had plenty of room for advancement. Phelps split time in 1983 between Seattle and its Pacific Coast League affiliate in Salt Lake City. Again, he hit minor league pitching well (.341 with 24 HR and 82 RBI in 74 games), but he did not play much in the majors. In 1984, he played a bit more for Seattle, hitting 24 HR in only 290 at-bats. Bad luck intervened early that year when a pitch broke his hand in the third game of the season; he had won the regular first base job, and hit two home runs in his first three-game and had five hits in his first ten at-bats. The injury resulted in the call-up of first baseman Alvin Davis after just one game in Triple-A, who immediately produced; Davis was named to the American League All-Star team and was the league's Rookie of the Year.\n\nThe next season, Phelps found himself behind Davis at first and Gorman Thomas at DH, who had been signed as a free agent the previous season as an which limited Phelps to a mere 116 major league at-bats.\n\nIn 1986 at the age 31, Phelps got into the major league lineup on a more-or-less regular basis. Although he was normally platooned against left-handed pitchers, Phelps still clocked 51 HR from It was at this time that his career travails inspired author Bill James to create the \"Ken Phelps All-Star\" team. As James described it:\n\nKen Phelpses are just \"available\"; if you want one, all you have to do is ask. They are players whose real limitations are exaggerated by baseball insiders, players who get stuck with a label -- the label of their limits, the label the things they \"can't\" do -- while those that they can do are overlooked... The Ken Phelps All-Stars [are] a whole teamful of guys who are wearing labels, but who nonetheless can play major-league baseball, and will prove it if they ever get the chance.\n\nPhelps hit 14 more home runs for Seattle in the first half of 1988. Impressed, owner George Steinbrenner of the New York Yankees traded Triple-A prospect Jay Buhner to Seattle in exchange for Phelps, despite already having Don Mattingly and Jack Clark to play first base and DH. With limited playing time, Phelps found it difficult to maintain his production of the previous four-and-a-half seasons, while Buhner went on to become an All-Star and legendary Mariners player. A \"Seinfeld\" episode in early 1996 (\"The Caddy\") depicted Yankee fan Frank Costanza (played by Jerry Stiller) as more upset about the Buhner trade than about the supposed death of his own son Phelps only hit 17 home runs for the Yankees before being traded to the Oakland Athletics in late August 1989. The A's won the World Series, but Phelps had just two at-bats in the post-season, with a pinch-hit double in the third game of the league championship series.\n\nPhelps' final home run might have been his most notable; it came with Oakland before a sell-out home crowd in 1990 on April 20, with two outs in the bottom of the ninth that Friday night. Phelps was called out of the dugout to pinch hit against Brian Holman of the Mariners, who had retired the first 26 batters in succession; he homered on the first pitch to ruin the perfect game.\n\nYears later, Phelps said he wanted to hit it out because he did not want to watch himself on ESPN's \"SportsCenter\" all season making the out to complete Holman's gem. He was traded to Cleveland in mid-June, and retired after playing 7 games for the Giants AAA affiliate in Phoenix the next season in 1991 at the age of 36.\n\nPhelps' career .239 batting average hides the things that, as James pointed out, he \"could\" do. Thanks to outstanding power and strike zone judgment, his career OPS is a strong .854. Phelps hit 123 home runs in 1854 career at-bats, the 28th best ratio in major league history through 2004 (min. 1500 plate appearances). Phelps hit 100 career home runs in 1322 at-bats — the second fastest, as measured by at bats, in MLB history, behind Ryan Howard in 1141 at-bats; Phelps still holds the AL record.\n\nAs of 2005, Phelps did color commentary on the radio for Arizona Diamondbacks baseball games. In 2006, Phelps was replaced as the Diamondbacks color analyst by former Major League pitcher Tom Candiotti. Today, he does baseball analysis for Fox Sports Arizona, along with community and media work he does for the state's largest electric utility, Arizona Public Service. Programs that Phelps has been involved with (The ABC's of Baseball, and Life and Power Players) have received national recognition for having positive impact on children.\n\n"}

It is based upon Bapsi Sidhwa's novel, \"Cracking India\" (1991, US; 1992, India; originally published as \"Ice Candy Man\", 1988, UK), set during the 1947 partition of India. \"Earth\" is the second installment of Mehta's Elements trilogy, preceded by \"Fire\" (1996) and followed by \"Water\" (2005). It was India's entry for the 1999 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nThe story is set in Lahore (now the capital of Pakistani Punjab) in the time period directly before and during the partition of India in 1947 at the time of Indian independence.\n\nA young girl with polio, Lenny (Maia Sethna), narrates the story through the voice of her adult self (Shabana Azmi). She is from a wealthy Parsi family who hope to remain neutral to the rising tensions between Hindus, Sikhs, and Muslims in the area. She is adored and protected by her parents, Bunty (Kitu Gidwani) and Rustom (Arif Zakaria), and cared for by her Ayah, a beautiful Hindu woman named Shanta (Nandita Das). Both Dil Navaz, the Ice-Candy Man (Aamir Khan), and Hassan, the Masseur (Rahul Khanna) are Muslim and in love with Shanta. Shanta, Dil, and Hassan are part of a small group of friends from different faiths (some of whom work for Lenny's family) who spend their days together in the park. With partition, however, this once unified group of friends becomes divided and tragedy ensues.\n\n\nThe film holds an 86% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 35 reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars and states that \"Earth\", \"is effective because it doesn't require much history from its viewers, explains what needs to be known, and has a universal message.\" \"The New York Times\" described it as \"a powerful and disturbing reminder of how a civilization can suddenly crack under certain pressures.\" \"The New Yorker\" argues that, \"Deepa Mehta handles her material convincingly, and the cast is so likable that they wear the larger themes like beautiful garments.\" Rediff.com notes that, \"Aamir Khan has probably given the best performance of his life. It is hard to imagine another actor bringing alive the nuances of the ice-candy man the way he does.\" \"Planet Bollywood\" gave the film a 9.5 out of 10 and stated that, \"\"Earth\" is strongly recommended to those who want to see a different type of Hindi film and who are tired of the usual boy meets girl stories and revenge dramas.\"\n\n\n"}

Originally based on a modified OH-6A, it was later based on the MD 500E, with a single five-bladed main rotor. The newest version, the MH-6M, is based on the MD 530F and has a single, six-bladed main rotor and four-bladed tail rotor.\n\nThe OH-6 was started in 1960, when the U.S. Army issued Technical Specification 153 for a Light Observation Helicopter (LOH) that could perform personnel transport, escort and attack missions, casualty evacuation, and observation. Twelve companies took part in the competition and Hughes Tool Company's Aircraft Division submitted the Model 369. Two designs, those submitted by Fairchild-Hiller and Bell, were selected as finalists by the Army-Navy design competition board, but the Army later included the helicopter from Hughes as well.\n\nThe first Model 369 prototype flew on 27 February 1963. Originally designated the YHO-6A under the army's designation system, the aircraft was redesignated the YOH-6A under the Department of Defense's new joint system in 1962. Five prototypes were built, each fitted with a Allison T63-A-5A engine, and delivered to the U.S. Army at Fort Rucker, Alabama to compete against the other 10 prototype aircraft submitted by Bell and Fairchild-Hiller. In the end, Hughes won the competition and the Army awarded a contract for production in May 1965. The initial order was for 714 aircraft, but that was later increased to 1,300 with an option to buy another 114. Seventy helicopters were built in the first month.\n\nThis agile, unarmed helicopter is outfitted with outboard \"benches\" designed to ferry up to three commandos on each side. There is also a gunship variant, the AH-6. Painted black for nighttime operations, this small aircraft can conduct rapid insertions and extractions of special operations forces into areas its larger brother, the MH-60 Black Hawk, cannot.\n\nAfter the April 1980 failure of Operation Eagle Claw, it was determined that the US Army lacked aircraft and crews who were trained and prepared to perform special operations missions. (Marine pilots and Navy helicopters were used.) To remedy this shortcoming, the Army began developing a special aviation task force to prepare for the next attempt to rescue the hostages: Operation Credible Sport.\n\nThe United States Army 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne), also known as Night Stalkers, is a special operations force that provides helicopter aviation support for general purpose forces and special operations forces. Its missions have included attack, assault, and reconnaissance, and are usually conducted at night, at high speeds, low altitudes, and on short notice.\n\nThe architects of the task force identified the need for a small helicopter that could land in the most restrictive locations and could be easily transported on Air Force airlifters. They chose the OH-6A scout helicopter, and it became known as the Little Bird compared to the other aircraft in the task force, the UH-60A and the CH-47C. As a separate part of the project, armed OH-6As were being developed at Fort Rucker, Alabama.\n\nThe pilots selected to fly the OH-6A helicopters came from the 229th Attack Helicopter Battalion and were sent to the Mississippi Army National Guard's Army Aviation Support Facility (AASF) at Gulfport, Mississippi, for two weeks of qualification training in the aircraft. When the training was completed, C-141 aircraft transported the aircraft and crews to Fort Huachuca, Arizona, for two weeks of mission training. The mission training consisted of loading onto C-130 transport aircraft which would then transport them to forward staging areas over routes as long as . The armed OH-6 aircraft from Fort Rucker joined the training program in the fall of 1980.\n\nOperation Credible Sport was a joint project of the U.S. military in the second half of 1980 to prepare for a second rescue attempt of the hostages held in Iran. It was canceled after the hostages were released on 20 January 1981 and, for a short while, it looked as if the task force would be disbanded and the personnel returned to their former units. However, the Army decided that it would be more prudent to keep the unit. The task force, which had been designated Task Force 158, was soon formed into the 160th Aviation Battalion. The OH-6A helicopters used for transporting personnel became the MH-6 aircraft of the Light Assault Company and the armed OH-6As became the AH-6 aircraft of the Light Attack Company. \n\nThe OH-6s of 160th SOAR were some of the first to see action in Grenada during Operation Urgent Fury. A/MH-6 Little Birds were used during the 1983 invasion of Grenada to evacuate casualties onto naval ship decks. The existence of the unit became widely known in the aftermath of the October 1983 invasion of Grenada, as OH-6s helicopters were seen supporting Special Operations during this operation.DoD and the US Army denied A/MH-6s were used in the operation despite amateur video showing the helicopters in action.\n\nThe OH-6s were flown in USAF C-130 transport planes, two at a time, to nearby Barbados. From there they flew to Grenada.\n\nBy 1983, 160th SOAR and its helicopters were heavily committed to supporting the contras, a United States-subsidized military force. Specially adapted unmarked Hughes 500D helicopters from CIA Seaspray unit based in Fort Eustis also took part in this task .\n\nMH-6s were based in Palmerola Air Base, Honduras, and flew missions into Nicaragua. The unit members wore civilian clothes, flew by night, and were instructed to destroy their aircraft if they were forced down.\n\nOn 24 July 1987, a Kuwaiti oil tanker, reflagged as \"Bridgeton\" and escorted by U.S. Navy warships, struck a mine in the Persian Gulf. It became apparent that more than escort ships would be required to guard merchant ships. The U.S. military deployed the MH-6 and AH-6 aircraft from the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR) to provide surveillance and patrols in cooperation with other U.S. special operations units in Operation Prime Chance.\n\nTwo MH-6 and four AH-6 aircraft were initially deployed and designated as Detachment 160 Aviation Group (DET 160 AVGP). The MH-6 aircraft carried Forward Looking Infra-Red (FLIR) and a videotape system which gave them excellent ability to detect and identify targets, then direct the armed AH-6s. The AH-6 helicopters were armed with 7.62 miniguns and 2.75-inch rockets. Initially, the aircraft patrolled in teams (call sign \"SEABAT\") that waited for U.S. Navy SH-2s to direct them to the targets. Later, to preserve the aircraft and crews from fatigue and wear, the SEABAT teams remained on the ship's deck until a contact was identified.\n\nAt 10 pm on 21 September 1987, the captain of launched a SEABAT team (a MH-6 and two AH-6s) to check out reports of Iranian minelaying. The team found \"Iran Ajr\", an amphibious landing ship equipped with minelaying racks. The MH-6 confirmed that \"Iran Ajr\" was laying mines, the AH-6s opened fire, causing the crew to abandon ship. The vessel was subsequently boarded and captured.\n\nOn the night of 8 October 1987, an Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps Boghammar and two Boston Whaler boats were detected by an SH-2. A SEABAT team was launched from , and as the MH-6 drew near to investigate, the Boghammar opened fire, the first of a series of engagements by both AH-6s and the MH-6 (recently armed with a minigun). The Boghammar launched two Stinger missiles at the helicopters, but eventually all three boats were sunk.\n\nFor the remainder of the operation, it was decided that barges set up as mobile sea bases (MSB) would facilitate the operation of the special operations forces. \"Hercules\" and \"Wimbrown VII\" were leased to provide these bases and the SEABAT teams began operating from the barges.\n\nIn early 1988, it was decided that modified U.S. Army OH-58D helicopters, fitted with weapons, would replace the SEABAT teams. On 24 February 1988, a team of two AHIP helicopters replaced the SEABAT team on the Wimbrown VII but it would be several months (June 1988) before the SEABAT team aboard the barge Hercules would be relieved by another AHIP detachment.\n\nOn 17 December 1989, 9 MH-6s, 11 AH-6G/Js, 19 UH/MH-60As were flown by Air Force C-5 Galaxy airlifters to Howard AFB's Hangar 3. After dark, on 19 December, the aircraft were rolled out to prepare for Operation Just Cause.\n\nBefore the main invasion force arrived in Panama City, Panama, two MH-6s supported by two AH-6s landed at Torrijos-Tocumen Airport to insert a beacon and combat controllers. Four other AH-6s conducted pre-assault attacks on the Panamanian Defense Force (PDF) Headquarters, \"La Comandancia\", adjoining the heavily populated \"El Chorrillo\" neighborhood in downtown Panama City. One of the AH-6s was damaged by ground fire and crashlanded in the Comandancia compound. The two pilots, pinned down by small-arms fire for two hours, eventually made their way back to friendly forces, taking a PDF soldier prisoner along the way.\n\nOther AH-6s escorted MH-6s on a rooftop rescue operation conducted at \"Cárcel Modelo\", a prison adjacent to La Comandancia. In Operation Acid Gambit, the aircraft approached the prison. Under fire from a nearby apartment house, the Little Birds landed on the roof, dropped off the rescue team, and lifted off. Upon their return, heavy smoke made it tough to find the roof and the helicopters took heavy fire from a cellblock about 50 to from the landing site. Maj. Richard Bowman, a copilot, took a round in the elbow. His pilot took over the controls and landed the aircraft. The aircraft picked up the rescue personnel and headed back toward Howard AFB, but one MH-6 lost power as it left the roof, and crashed in the street below with minor injuries to the passengers, who were helped from the crash site by U.S. infantry soldiers.\n\nElsewhere, four AH-6s provided fire support for the airborne assault at Rio Hato Airfield, supported by an MH-60 which operated as a Forward Arming and Refuel Point (FARP). Two nine-man teams from the 160th participated in the airborne assaults of Torrijos-Tocumen Airfield and Rio Hato Airfield, and were dropped from Air Force C-141s to set up FARPs, platforms with HE-rocket and minigun ammunition, parts and replacements for the miniguns, and fuel and refueling pumps, hoses, etc. But the FARP dropped at Rio Hato landed out of reach in a marsh, forcing the team to \"wet wing\" refuel from the MH-60.\n\nThe Rio Hato mission originally included nine other MH-60s and four MH-6s. Several hours prior to H-hour, these aircraft and crews were instead sent to support a raid near Colón, Panama, a key PDF stronghold where PDF leaders were believed to be. At H-hour, the helicopters conducted an air assault on a beach house along the coast of Colon. It was during this mission that the first 160th soldiers to die in combat perished when their AH-6 was shot down.\n\nAnother force of eight MH-60s and four MH-6s waited on the airstrip with crew aboard, to conduct follow-on raids should the need arise.\n\nAfter these initial missions, elements of the 160th provided support to special operations forces securing outlying areas, recovering weapons caches, and \"hunt for Elvis\" – the phrase the men of the 160th used to refer to the search for General Manuel Noriega. Four MH-60s, two MH-6s, two AH-6s, and two MH-47s were moved to Ft. Sherman in the north for operations in and around Colon.\n\nThe 160th conducted numerous air assault missions over the next two weeks, and on 3 January 1990, the majority of the force went back to Fort Campbell, Kentucky.\n\nMH-6 Little Birds were part of the initial assault near the Olympic Hotel in the Bakara Market of Mogadishu, Somalia. The MH-6s conducted rooftop insertions of Delta Force soldiers.\n\nAfter the shootdown of the MH-60L, call sign \"Super Six-One\", by a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG), an MH-6 Little Bird, call sign \"Star Four-One\", landed in the street next to the downed MH-60 and attempted to evacuate the casualties. The pilot went to assist survivors, successfully pulling two soldiers into the Little Bird, while the copilot laid down suppressive fire from the cockpit with his individual weapon. Under intense ground fire, the MH-6 departed with its crew and survivors.\n\nDuring the night, AH-6J gunships provided fire support to Rangers and Delta Force operators who were in defensive positions around the crash site of \"Super 6-1\" and under constant fire from Warlord Mohammad Farrah Aidid's militia members.\n\nDuring the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and up until the end of the war in late 2011, Little Bird pilots took part in numerous missions. Two AH-6 and two MH-6 helicopters were part of a special operations raid at Al Qadisiyah in western Iraq. AH-6 and MH-6 gave support for the 75th Ranger Regiment during its seizure of the Haditha Dam complex in April 2003.\n\nAH-6 helicopters were also tasked with supporting the rescue mission of Private First Class Jessica Lynch in April 2003.\n\nMH-6 helicopters were part of TF-145, as well as the rescue of three Italian contractors and Polish businessman taken hostage by Iraqi insurgents in 2004.\n\nIn September 2009, two AH-6 and two MH-6 helicopters were used in an operation in Somalia by U.S. Navy SEALs to kill wanted terrorist Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan.\n\nFor OH-6 and TH-6 variants, see OH-6 Cayuse.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2223589", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2223589", "title": "3 Ninjas (film)", "text": "3 Ninjas (film)\n\n3 Ninjas is a 1992 American martial arts comedy film directed by Jon Turteltaub and starring Victor Wong, Michael Treanor, Max Elliott Slade, and Chad Power. It was the only \"3 Ninjas \"film released by Touchstone Pictures, while the others were released by TriStar Pictures. The film is about three young brothers who learn martial arts from their Japanese grandfather.\n\nEvery year, twelve-year old Samuel, eleven-year old Jeffrey and eight-year old Michael Douglas visit their grandfather, Mori Tanaka at his cabin. Mori trains his grandchildren in the art of Ninjutsu. As the summer comes to an end, Mori gives each of them a new \"ninja\" name based on their personalities: 'Rocky', 'Colt', and 'Tum-Tum'.\n\nMeanwhile, the boys' father, Sam Douglas, is an FBI agent who stages a sting operation to entrap Hugo Snyder in the sale of warheads. Snyder escapes the trap with the use of his own ninja henchmen. Snyder decides to test Mori's fighting skill. The boys ignore Mori's orders to stay in the house and aid by defeating two ninjas on their own. Snyder threatens Mori's family if he does not get Douglas off his back, and Mori chides the boys briefly for interfering in his personal affairs. When they return home, they find their father unenthusiastic to see what they had learned during their visit and more annoyed at their new names. Emily, a friend of Rocky's, compliments his new name and agrees to ride with them to school the next day. Snyder develops a plan to kidnap the boys to use them as leverage to get Douglas to back off. Since the FBI watches them, his assistant Brown contacts his nephew Fester and his buddies Hammer and Marcus to kidnap the boys. Due to Douglas and his FBI crew's presence, they are unable to capture the boys.\n\nThe next day, Fester and his friends follow the boys to school but are side-tracked by a fender bender with a police car. Emily becomes separated from the boys and encounters a group of bullies who steal her bike. At recess, the boys challenge the bullies to a two-on-two basketball game to ten, and they spot the bullies nine points. The brothers effortlessly score ten consecutive points, winning Emily's bike and respect back. That night, Colt learns that Snyder, who they assumed was a friend of Mori's, is actually the criminal their father is after. They are left with a babysitter when Jessica leaves to pick up Sam, and Fester and his friends break into the house with a fake pizza order, subduing the babysitter. They use a device in Rocky's bedroom to call Emily over and use her as a hostage. Due to an earlier trap, Hammer and Marcus run to the bathrooms sick to their stomachs, and the boys defeat Fester. Hammer and Marcus are subsequently defeated. After freeing the babysitter, the boys are overpowered by Brown and Snyder's bodyguard Rushmore.\n\nThe boys escape their captivity and manage to subdue Rushmore. Snyder confronts Mori and challenges him to a fight for the boys' freedom. Due to his youth and speed, Snyder almost proves too much for Mori, until he remembers a handful of jelly beans which Tum-Tum had given him and uses them to gag Snyder. Refusing defeat, Snyder grabs a gun from one of his subordinates but is suddenly shot and subdued by Douglas. Snyder and his men are arrested.\n\nThe international cut of the film features a number of small parts of scenes that were cut from the movie for its American release, most likely to ensure a PG rating. Among the cut scenes are [not all-inclusive]: Extra footage of Snyder's escape in which he confronts two FBI agents whom he promptly defeats, a scene in which the robbers fire a gun in the convenience store and tie up the clerk behind the counter, a scene in which the robbers get the Douglas family address from Brown, additional footage of Grandpa trailing Snyder to his ship hideout, numerous small portions of the scene where the robbers invade the Douglas household, including Colt beating the robbers after getting them under a tarp in the room being renovated and a scene of Fester, the leader of the robbers asking his uncle (Brown) if he can be paid, extra sarcastic dialogue while the boys are locked up in Snyder's ship, an extended scene in which the boys are reunited with Grandpa. Additionally, in the international version the boys lose the basketball challenge and their bikes, so a scene ends the international version of the film in which they fight the bullies to get them back.\n\n\nThe film was received negatively by critics. It currently holds a 29% \"Rotten\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 21 reviews. Among the more negative notices, Stephen Holden of \"The New York Times\" said that \"the film can't seem to make up its mind whether it wants to be a comedy, a fantasy or an adventure film\" and that \"beneath all the excitement, the message that '3 Ninjas' conveys is anything but reassuring.\" It did attain a favorable response from Kevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\", who said that \"although their attention may wander, parents can be grateful that there's some substance as well as fun in this Disney release, for martial arts is presented as a matter of defense rather than aggression, emphasizing that it is a matter of mind and spirit as well as body and requiring resourcefulness and discipline.\" Later on, it would receive a cult following for its camp factor and spawned three less successful sequels \"3 Ninjas Kick Back\", \"3 Ninjas Knuckle Up\", and \"\".\n\nThe film opened at the box office in the #4 position, and by the end of its 6-week run in theaters grossed US$29,000,301 domestically. Considering that the film was budgeted at $2.5 million, it was a huge financial success, and turned out to be the most profitable film of the year in terms of cost-to-gross ratio.\n\nSlade, Power and Treanor host an annual screening and Q&A in Oak Park, California each April.\n\n"}

She is based in Galveston, Texas, and is one of the oldest ships sailing today. Launched in 1877, she is now a museum ship at the Texas Seaport Museum. She was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1990.\n\n\"Elissa\" was built in Aberdeen, Scotland as a merchant vessel in a time when steamships were overtaking sailing ships. She was originally launched on October 27, 1877. She was named for the niece of Henry Fowler Watt, \"Elissa's\" first owner, though according to his descendants the ship was named for the Queen of Carthage, Elissa (more commonly called Dido), Aeneas' tragic lover in the epic poem \"The Aeneid\".\n\n\"Elissa\" also sailed under Norwegian and Swedish flags. In Norway she was known as the \" of Tønsberg\" and her master was Captain . In Sweden her name was \"Gustav of Gothenburg\". In 1918, she was converted into a two-masted brigantine and an engine was installed. She was sold to Finland in 1930 (owned by Gustaf Erikson to 1942) and reconverted into a schooner. In 1959, she was sold to Greece, and successively sailed under the names \"Christophoros\", in 1967 as \"Achaeos\", and in 1969 as \"Pioneer\". In 1970, she was rescued from destruction in Piraeus after being purchased for the San Francisco Maritime Museum. However, she languished in a salvage yard in Piraeus until she was purchased for $40,000, in 1975, by the Galveston Historical Foundation, her current owners. In 1979, after a year in Greece having repairs done to her hull, \"Elissa\" was first towed to Gibraltar. There, she was prepared for an ocean tow by Captain Jim Currie of the New Orleans surveyors J.K. Tynan International. The restoration process continued until she was ready for tow on June 7, 1979.\n\n\"Elissa\" has an iron hull, and the pin rail and bright work is made of teak. Her masts are Douglas fir from Oregon, and her 19 sails were made in Maine. She has survived numerous modifications including installation of an engine, and the incremental removal of all her rigging and masts.\n\n\"Elissa\" made her first voyage as a restored sailing ship in 1985, traveling to Corpus Christi, Texas. In Freeport the crew was joined by seventh grader Jerry Diegel and Betty Rusk, his history and English teacher, after Diegel won an essay contest on the history of the Elissa. A year later, she sailed to New York City to take part in the Statue of Liberty's centennial celebrations. When she's not sailing, \"Elissa\" is moored at the Texas Seaport Museum in Galveston. Public tours are available year-round-provided she is not out sailing. The ship is sailed and maintained by qualified volunteers from around the nation.\nIn July 2011, the U.S. Coast Guard declared \"Elissa\" to be \"not seaworthy.\" Officials at the Texas Seaport Museum in Galveston where \"Elissa\" is berthed were astonished when a Coast Guard inspection in 2011 revealed a corroded hull. The tall ship is inspected twice every five years, said John Schaumburg, museum assistant director. The 2011 inspection uncovered the worst corrosion since the tall ship was rebuilt in 1982, he said.\n\nTexas Seaport Museum raised the $3 million that paid for hull replacement and other long-overdue maintenance projects, finishing in January 2013. The museum also replaced the 22,000 board feet of Douglas fir decking. Including building new quarter deck furniture out of high quality teak. Elissa returned to sailing once again in March 2014. She ran a series of daily sails for a period of two weeks out of her home port of Galveston TX.\n\nElissa's sail training program for the 2017-2018 sailing season is currently underway with plans to compete as the Flagship in the Tall Ship Challenge-Gulf Coast in April 2018 where she will sail to Pensacola, FL and New Orleans, LA. She will also complete a week long series of daily sails prior to her trip to Florida. Elissa remains one of the world's oldest sailing hulls still in operation. The oldest is the coasting schooner Lewis R. French, launched in 1871 in Christmas Cove, Maine USA. She still sails as part of the windjammer fleet out of Camden, Maine USA.\n\n\n\n"}

Released as a single in early 1977, it was the only number-one song for the group in the UK. It was later covered by Dannii Minogue in 1992.\n\n\"Show You the Way to Go\" became a hit for the Jacksons, (formerly known as \"The Jackson 5\") after their departure from Motown nearly two years prior. The move made it easy for the brothers to write and produce their own material. They spent a couple of years under the production and direction of Gamble and Huff and were signed to Philadelphia International Records. This was one of the songs that the producers wrote for the brothers.\n\nThis song was released after \"Enjoy Yourself,\" released a year earlier. Michael sang lead and background vocals. Marlon Jackson, and the rest of the brothers (Randy having replaced Jermaine) had backup parts.

He quickly established himself as the franchise's top position prospect in the system. He was often compared to Lenny Dykstra due to his aggressive play and ability to hit for average and draw walks. He made it to the major leagues in 2002, but during a baserunning mishap tore his ACL in his left knee. After that incident, his status as a top prospect began to decline, as Snelling suffered numerous serious injuries in subsequent years. At Seattle Mariners fan blog USS Mariner, Snelling was dubbed \"Doyle\" (his middle name) in hopes of driving off the injury curse that plagued him.\n\nOn the night of December 13, 2006, \"The Washington Post\" reported that Snelling and Mariners pitching prospect Emiliano Fruto would be traded to the Washington Nationals for veteran second baseman José Vidro. The trade was completed several days later.\n\nFollowing the Virginia Tech massacre, players for the Nationals wore Virginia Tech baseball caps for their game against the Atlanta Braves on April 17, 2007. Snelling's cap was then sent to the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York.\n\nOn the evening of May 2, 2007, during a game between the Nationals and San Diego Padres, Snelling was traded to the Oakland Athletics for outfielder Ryan Langerhans.\n\nSnelling was claimed off waivers from the Athletics by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays on October 25, 2007.\n\nWith a crowded outfield, the Rays traded Snelling to the Philadelphia Phillies for cash considerations on November 20, 2007. The Phillies sent him outright to the minors on March 28, 2008.\n\nOn April 12, 2008, Snelling was recalled from the minor leagues by the Phillies after an injury to Shane Victorino. Despite getting only 4 AB, he had two very key hits for the Phillies who won the division by just three games. On April 15, he hit a pinch hit, first pitch HR off Houston Astros closer José Valverde in the 9th inning with his team down three runs. The Phillies scored three more runs in the inning and won the game. On June 6, he hit a pinch hit double to lead off the top of the 10th inning against the Atlanta Braves. The Phillies scored two runs in the inning and won the game.\n\nHe was designated for assignment on June 7.

{"id": "2223628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2223628", "title": "Jewish hat", "text": "Jewish hat\n\nThe Jewish hat also known as the Jewish cap, Judenhut (German) or Latin \"pileus cornutus\" (\"horned skullcap\"), was a cone-shaped pointed hat, often white or yellow, worn by Jews in Medieval Europe and some of the Islamic world. Initially worn by choice, its wearing was enforced in some places in Europe after the 1215 Fourth Council of the Lateran for adult male Jews to wear while outside a ghetto to distinguish them from others. Like the Phrygian cap that it often resembles, the hat originated in pre-Islamic Persia, as a similar hat was worn by Babylonian Jews.\n\nModern distinctive or characteristic Jewish forms of male headgear include the kippah (skullcap), shtreimel, spodik, kolpik, kashkets, and fedora; see also Hasidic headwear.\n\nThe shape of the hat is variable. Sometimes, especially in the thirteenth century, it is a soft Phrygian cap, but rather more common in the early period is a hat with a round circular brim—apparently stiff—curving round to a tapering top that ends in a point, called the \"so-called oil-can type\" by Sara Lipton. Smaller versions perching on top of the head are also seen. Sometimes a ring of some sort encircles the hat an inch or two over the top of the head. In the fourteenth century a ball or bobble appears at the top of the hat, and the tapering end becomes more of a stalk with a relatively constant width. The top of the hat becomes flatter, or rounded (as in the Codex Manesse picture). The materials used are unclear from art, and may have included metal and woven plant materials as well as stiffened textiles and leather.\n\nBy the end of the Middle Ages the hat is steadily replaced by a variety of headgear including exotic flared Eastern style hats, turbans and, from the fifteenth century, wide flat hats and large berets. In pictures of Biblical scenes these sometimes represent attempts to portray the contemporary dress of the (modern) time worn in the Holy Land, but all the same styles are to be seen in some images of contemporary European scenes. Where a distinctive pointed Jewish hat remains it has become much less defined in shape, and baggy. Loose turbans, wide flat hats, and berets, as well as new fur hat styles from the Pale of Settlement, remain associated with Jews up to the eighteenth century and beyond.\n\nThe origin of the hat is unclear, although it is often seen as ultimately evolving from the same origin as the mitre, perhaps from late Roman styles, which may themselves derive from the hats of ancient Persian clergy. Hats worn (by Pharaoh's advisors, among others) in the illustrations to the Old English Hexateuch, a manuscript of around 1030, have been seen as an early form, and they appear in the Flemish Stavelot Bible of 1097.\n\nIn Europe, the Jewish hat was worn in France from the eleventh century, and Italy from the twelfth. The Gniezno Doors were probably made in Germany around 1175, and two Jewish merchants depicted on the doors wear them. Under Jewish law, observant Jews should keep their heads covered almost all the time, and indeed men of all religious groups tended to wear hats when outside in the Middle Ages to a much greater extent than today. Unlike the yellow badge, the Jewish hat is often seen in illustrated Hebrew manuscripts, and was later included by German Jews in their seals and coats of arms, suggesting that at least initially it was regarded by European Jews as \"an element of traditional garb, rather than an imposed discrimination\". The hat is also worn in Christian pictures by figures such as Saint Joseph and sometimes Jesus (see below). However, once \"made obligatory, the hat, hitherto deliberately different from hats worn by Christians, was viewed by Jews in a negative light\". A provincial synod held in Breslau in 1267 said that since Jews had stopped wearing the pointed hats they used to wear, this would be made compulsory.\n\nThe Fourth Council of the Lateran of 1215 ruled that Jews and Muslims must be distinguishable by their dress (Latin \"habitus\"), the rationale given being: \"In some provinces the dress of Jews and Saracens distinguishes them from Christians, but in others a degree of confusion has arisen, so that they cannot be recognised by any distinguishing marks. As a result, in error Christians have sexual intercourse with Jewish or Saracen women, and Jews and Saracens have intercourse with Christian women. In order that the crime of such an accursed mingling shall not in future have an excuse and an evasion under the pretext of error, we resolve that (Jews and Saracens) of both sexes in all Christian lands shall distinguish themselves publicly from other people by their dress. According to the testimony of scripture, such a precept was already made by Moses (Lev.19.19; Deut.22.5.11)\".\n\nHowever, not all European medieval monarchs followed these pontifical resolutions. King Andrew II of Hungary (1177–1235), ignored on several occasions demands from the Pope, which gained him excommunication twice. At that time many Jews were in royal service. The excommunications even forbade Andrew II from being present at his daughter Elisabeth of Hungary's canonization in Germany. The hat was mostly found north of the Alps, despite some of the earliest examples being seen in Italy, and was not found in Spain.\n\nAdditional rules were imposed by local rulers at various times. The council decision was confirmed by the Council of Vienne of 1311–12. In 1267 the hat was made compulsory in Vienna. A doctor was given a temporary dispensation from wearing it in Venice in 1528, at the request of various distinguished patients (at the time in Venice each profession had special clothing rules). Pope Paul IV ordered in 1555 that in the Papal States it must be a yellow, peaked hat, and from 1567 for twenty years it was compulsory in Lithuania, but by this period it is rarely seen in most of Europe. As an outcome of the Jewish Emancipation its use was formally discontinued, although it had been declining long before that, and is not often seen after 1500; the various forms of the yellow badge were far more long-lasting. This was an alternative form of distinguishing mark, not found in Europe before 1215, and later reintroduced by the Nazis. It was probably more widely required by local laws, for example English legislation concentrated on the badge, which took the form of the two Tablets of the Law. In some pictures from all parts of the Middle Ages, rabbis or other Jewish leaders wear the Jewish hat when other Jews do not, which may reflect reality.\n\nIn a late addition to local rulings, the very strict and unpopular Counter Reformation Pope Paul IV ordered in 1555 that all Jews in Rome were required to wear the yellow hat \"under the severest penalties.\" When he died, his statue, erected before the Campidoglio just months before, had a yellow hat placed on it (similar to the yellow hat Paul IV had forced Jews to wear in public). After a mock trial, the statue was decapitated. It was then thrown into the Tiber.\n\nThe Jewish hat is frequently used in medieval art to denote Jews of the Biblical period. Often the Jews so shown are those shown in an unfavourable light by the story being depicted, such as the money-changers expelled by Jesus from the Temple (Matthew 21:12–17), but this is by no means always the case. The husband of Mary, Saint Joseph, is often shown wearing a Jewish hat, and Jesus himself may be shown wearing one, especially in depictions of the \"Meeting at Emmaus\", where his disciples do not recognise him at first (Luke.24.13-32). Sometimes it is used to distinguish Jews from other peoples such as Egyptians or Philistines. It is often depicted in art from times and places where the hat does not seem to have actually been commonly worn by Jews, \"as an external and largely arbitrary sign devised by Christian iconographers\", one of a number of useful visual ways of identifying types of persons in medieval art.\n\nIn notable contrast to forms of Jewish badge, the Jewish hat is often seen in Hebrew manuscript illuminations such as Haggadot made in medieval Europe (\"picture above\"). In the Birds' Head Haggadah (Germany, c. 1300), the figures wear the hat when sitting to eat the Passover Seder.\n\nHowever, in Christian art the wearing of the hat can be sometimes be seen to express an attitude to those wearing it. In one extreme example in a manuscript of the \"Bible moralisée\", an illustration shows the rod of Aaron, which has turned into a serpent, turning on the Pharaoh's magicians (Exodus, 7:10-12); Moses and Aaron do not wear the hat but the Egyptian magicians do, signifying not that they are Jews, but that they are \"like\" Jews, i.e. on the wrong side of the dispute. The paired roundel below shows two tonsured clerics confronting a group of hat-wearing Jews, and has a Latin caption explaining \"Moses and Aaron signify good prelates who, in explaining the words of the Gospel, devour the false words of the Jews\". In another scene showing the conversion of Jews and other non-Christians at the end of the world, a series of figures show different stages of removing their hats to signify the stages they have reached in their conversion, so that \"the hat does not just identify Jews; it functions independently of its placement to signify infidelity and recalcitrant Jewishness\".\n\nOther scenes in Christian art where some characters often wear it include the Circumcision of Christ and \"Saint Helena Finding the True Cross\", where the medieval legend specified a Jewish character.\n\nWilliam III the Brave (1425–1482) of Meissen, minted a silver groschen known as the Judenkopf Groschen. Its obverse portrait shows a man with a pointed beard wearing a Judenhut, which the populace took as depicting a typical Jew.\n\nFor dhimmis to be clearly distinguishable from Muslims in public, Muslim rulers often prohibited dhimmis from wearing certain types of clothing, while forcing them to put on highly distinctive garments, usually of a bright colour. These included headgear, though this was not usually the primary element. At some times the regulated dress of Christians and Jews differed, at others it did not. As in Europe, the degree to which the recorded regulations were enforced is hard to assess, and probably varied greatly.\n\nIslamic scholars cited the Pact of Umar in which Christians supposedly took an obligation to \"always dress in the same way wherever we may be, and… bind the zunar [wide belt] round our waists\". Al-Nawawi required dhimmis to wear a piece of yellow cloth and a belt, as well as a metallic ring, inside public baths.\n\nRegulations on dhimmi clothing varied frequently to please the whims of the ruler. Although the initiation of such regulations is usually attributed to Umar I, historical evidence suggests that it was the Abbasid caliphs who pioneered this practice. In 850 the caliph al‑Mutawakkil ordered Christians and Jews to wear both a sash called a \"zunnah\" and a distinctive kind of shawl or headscarf called a \"taylasin\" (the Christians had already been required to wear the sash). He also required them to wear small bells in public baths. In the eleventh century, the Fatimid caliph Al-Hakim, whose various extreme decrees and actions are usually attributed to mental illness, ordered Christians to put on half-meter wooden crosses and Jews to wear wooden calves around their necks. In the late twelfth century, Almohad ruler Abu Yusuf ordered the Jews of the Maghreb to wear dark blue garments with long sleeves and saddle-like caps. His grandson Abdallah al-Adil made a concession after appeals from the Jews, relaxing the required clothing to yellow garments and turbans. In the sixteenth century, Jews of the Maghreb could only wear sandals made of rushes and black turbans or caps with an extra red piece of cloth.\n\nOttoman sultans continued to regulate the clothing of their non-Muslim subjects. In 1577, Murad III issued a firman forbidding Jews and Christians from wearing dresses, turbans, and sandals. In 1580, he changed his mind, restricting the previous prohibition to turbans and requiring dhimmis to wear black shoes; Jews and Christians also had to wear red and black hats, respectively. Observing in 1730 that some Muslims took to the habit of wearing caps similar to those of the Jews, Mahmud I ordered the hanging of the perpetrators. Mustafa III personally helped to enforce his decrees regarding clothes. In 1758, he was walking incognito in Istanbul and ordered the beheading of a Jew and an Armenian seen dressed in forbidden attire. The last Ottoman decree affirming the distinctive clothing for dhimmis was issued in 1837 by Mahmud II. Discriminatory clothing was not enforced in those Ottoman provinces where Christians were the majority, such as Greece and the Balkans.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1990 at Belmont Park she ran against the Argentinian mare Bayakoa in the Breeders' Cup Distaff. Go For Wand was leading by a head at the sixteenth pole when she suffered an open fracture to her right cannon bone. She fell to the track and threw jockey Randy Romero to the ground before rising to limp on three legs. Track personnel caught her and got her to lie down, and she was immediately euthanized on the track. The next day, she was buried in the infield at Saratoga racetrack.\n\nLike the death of Ruffian at the same track, the accident was shown by NBC on live television, and reminded viewers of that promising filly who was fatally injured on the track. Several veterinarians estimate that she broke her leg about twelve strides before she fell, which would mean that she suffered her catastrophic injury while passing the flagpole next to which Ruffian was buried.\n\nIn 1992, the Maskette Stakes, a Grade 1 handicap race for fillies and mares, was renamed the \"Go For Wand Handicap\" in her memory.\n\nShe is listed as #72 by \"Blood Horse\" on their list of top 100 U.S. thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century and in 1996 was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.\n\nAs part of the \"Thoroughbred Legends\" series, in 2000, author Bill Heller published a book about the filly titled \"\"Go For Wand\".\" - Eclipse Press ()\n\n"}

It is both Starr's first compilation LP and his final release under his contract with EMI. It was also the last album to be released on the Beatles' Apple label until it was revived in the 1990s.\n\nThe album provides an overview of Starr's most successful period as a solo artist. The songs include his RIAA gold-certified singles \"It Don't Come Easy\", \"Photograph\" and \"You're Sixteen\", and other international hits such as \"Back Off Boogaloo\" and \"Only You\". The album peaked at number 30 on the US \"Billboard\" pop LPs chart but failed to chart in the UK.\n\n\"Blast from Your Past\" provides an overview of Starr's musical achievements as a solo artist during the first half of the 1970s. The album compiles eight singles, one B-side, and one album track, all released between 1970 and 1975. All eight of the singles charted on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in the US; \"Photograph\" and \"You're Sixteen\" each hit number 1, while all of them but \"Beaucoups of Blues\" made the top ten. Five of the songs charted in the United Kingdom, where the non-album single \"Back Off Boogaloo\" was the highest placed, at number 2. \"Early 1970\" was the B-side to \"It Don't Come Easy\", another non-album single, and \"I'm the Greatest\" was taken from the album \"Ringo\". \"Oh My My\", \"Photograph\" and \"You're Sixteen\" were taken from \"Ringo\" also, and \"No No Song\" and \"Only You (And You Alone)\" first appeared on \"Goodnight Vienna\".\n\nThe album was released in the US on 20 November 1975, and 12 December in the UK. The latter was issued with a red Apple label. The sleeve for the album was designed by Roy Kohara. In the UK, Apple issued \"Oh My My\", backed with \"No No Song\", as a single on 9 January 1976, to promote the compilation and also because both of the songs had appeared there only as album tracks. As with John Lennon's recently released Apple compilation, \"Shaved Fish\", the sales of \"Blast from Your Past\" were disappointing. The album failed to chart in the UK and peaked at number 30 in the US.\n\nIn his review for the \"NME\", Bob Woffinden wrote that few observers would have expected Starr to have amassed enough hit songs for a greatest hits set five years after the Beatles' break-up, given that he had sung and written little during the band's career. Woffinden criticised the brevity of the album, however, and said that, since only four of the tracks had been significant chart successes in the UK, and many of the songs had not been issued as singles there, \"why should [Starr] now consider an album of American 45s a going proposition in Britain?\" Writing in their book \"\", Roy Carr and Tony Tyler also commented on its \"short weight\" nature, saying: \"the tracks total no more than half-an-hour. Both sides together, that is.\"\n\n\"Blast from Your Past\" was reissued in the US by Capitol Records in September 1981, while in the UK it was released by the budget label Music for Pleasure on 25 November 1981. The album was issued on compact disc in the UK on 26 May 1987 and in the US on 18 January 1988.\n\nAll the tracks from \"Blast From Your Past\" appeared on the 2007 Ringo's career-spanning compilation album \"\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

MTNA offers a wide range of member resources, from leadership, teaching and personal health support, to insurance, financial and legal services. It also comprises two subsidiaries, the MTNA Professional Certification Program, and the MTNA Foundation Fund, which supports a variety of programs that include music competitions and commissioning of composers. MTNA was founded in 1876, and is registered as a 501(c)(3) organization in Ohio, with headquarters located in Cincinnati.\n\nMusic Teachers National Association is an American organization founded in 1876 by Theodore Presser, who was both a musician and publisher. MTNA is credited in helping to establish an international pitch scale in 1883 as well as promoting international copyright law and giving official recognition to the American composer. In 1967, MTNA approved the program for qualified teachers. MTNA is also known for commissioning compositions by American composers and presenting the annual Distinguished Composer of the Year Award. The association also hold annual competitions for young musicians at the local, state, and national level. Currently, the organization had approximately 22,000 members, including teachers, performers, and composers, and more that 500 local affiliates. The official journal of the MTNA, \"American Music Teacher\", was first published in 1951.\n\nMTNA's purpose is to advance the benefit of studying music and music making to society and to support the professionalism of music teachers. MTNA maintains two subsidiary programs: MTNA Professional Certification Program and the MTNA Foundation Fund. The Professional Certification Program exists to improve the quality of professionalism in applied music teaching and assists the public in identifying proficient music teachers in their communities. The MTNA Foundation Fund supports programs that financially assist teachers and students with educational objectives while supplying an opportunity for individual and corporate support of MTNA and its programs.\n\nAs an association of music teachers, MTNA's mission is to elevate the professional level and develop the standing of all its members. MTNA is responsible for disseminating many publications, including books, journals, and pamphlets that have greatly impacted the profession of teaching music. MTNA also perpetually seeks newly published music and other teaching materials to raise awareness among its members.\n\nAccording to MTNA, \"The National Certification Plan is one of the highest importance to the professional welfare of the music teacher, and it provides a means of measuring and recognizing his or her professional growth. It represents almost a century of consultation and deliberation on the part of America's musical leaders.\"\n\nThe independent music teachers forum of MTNA was the first established in 1972, at the MTNA Convention in Portland, Oregon. After this initial meeting, IMTF organized different committees on the local and state levels. Its purpose was \"To investigate the role of the full time independent teacher in American society today: the problems, advantages, and practices of this group, with the goal of establishing a true profession in this decade.\"\n\nMultiple forums now exist through MTNA. They provide an environment for open discussion and the expression of ideas. These forums meet annually at the MTNA conference. These forums include:\n\n\nFirst awarded in 1969, the terms of the Distinguished Composer of the Year Award state that an MTNA-affiliated state music teachers association could commission any composer of their choice to compose a work for their state convention. Recording and scores of these works could then be sent to the national headquarters in Cincinnati. From these commissions, one composer is selected each year by a panel of judges to receive the \"Distinguished Composer Award,\" otherwise known as the \"Composer of the Year\" award.\n\nPrevious winners include:\n\n\nThe MTNA National Conference, which is held annually, brings together the constituents of the MTNA membership. National competitions highlights the performances of students in all instrument areas, including composition. The national conferences also include master classes, technology and informational sessions, pedagogy sessions, and evening concerts. Members have the opportunity to participate in the national conference by submitting proposals and papers for presentation.\n\nDuring the Chicago convention of 1948, the MTNA Executive Committee established the divisional organizations. Each state was assigned to a particular division, even though the state in question, at the time, may not have had an organized chapter of the MTNA. The Current Divisions are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll fifty states and the District of Columbia have affiliations with MTNA. Forty-nine state (forty-eight states, and the District of Columbia) music teachers associations were established between 1876 and 1969. The final two states to be established were Maine in 1976 and Alaska in 1982.\n\n"}

During his four years at Clemson, he averaged 15.3 points per game, 6.8 rebounds per game and 2.7 blocks. His college team was involved in one of the most notable plays in college basketball history – a one-point loss in the 1990 NCAA Tournament to a Connecticut team following a miraculous full-court catch-and-shoot play by Tate George with one second on the clock. That same year, the Los Angeles Lakers drafted Campbell with the 27th pick in the 1990 NBA draft.\n\nOn March 10, 1999, Campbell was traded by the Lakers along with Eddie Jones to the Charlotte Hornets for Glen Rice, J.

During Campbell's tenure with the Pistons, perhaps his most important contribution was his defense against center Shaquille O'Neal in the two playoff series in which the Pistons engaged O'Neal's teams (against the Lakers in the 2004 Finals and against the Miami Heat in the 2005 NBA Eastern Conference Finals); because of his enormous bulk and strength, he presented a unique challenge to O'Neal in the low post and was one of the few NBA players who could pose a serious physical challenge to O'Neal on defense.\n\nCampbell's 15-year career comprised 1,044 games, of which he started 671, and 106 playoff games, of which he started 53.

He was especially known for his shot-blocking ability, with 1,602 career blocks; he is 31st all time in blocks. Notably, Campbell was the Los Angeles Lakers' leading scorer in the 1990s. His nicknames were 'Easy', 'Big E', 'Big Homie' and 'The Janitor', which he received for his ability to clean up the boards.\n\nCampbell was arrested for drunk driving in California in 1995.\n\n\n"}

The film stars Shirley MacLaine and Anne Bancroft, along with Leslie Browne, Mikhail Baryshnikov, and Tom Skerritt. The film was nominated for eleven Academy Awards, including Best Picture. The script is a fictionalized version of the real-life Brown family and the friendship between ballerinas Isabel Mirrow Brown (whose daughter, Leslie Browne, stars in the film) and Nora Kaye.\n\nDeeDee Rodgers (Shirley MacLaine) leaves the ballet company after becoming pregnant by Wayne (Tom Skerritt), another dancer in the company. They marry and later move to Oklahoma City to run a dance studio. Emma Jacklin (Anne Bancroft) stays with the company and eventually becomes a prima ballerina and well-known figure in the ballet community.\n\nWhile the company is on tour and performs a show in Oklahoma City, DeeDee and the family go to see the show, and then have an after-party for the company at her home. The reunion stirs up old memories and things begin to unravel.\n\nAt the party, DeeDee's aspiring dancer/daughter, Emilia (Leslie Browne), who is also Emma's goddaughter, is invited to take class with the company the following day. After taking class with the company, Emilia is asked to join the company but she does not immediately accept the offer as she wants to think it over before making her final decision. DeeDee and Wayne decide that DeeDee should go to New York with Emilia, who is rather shy and does not make friends as easily as her younger sister. Meanwhile, their son, Ethan, gets a scholarship to the company's summer program while Wayne and their other daughter stay in Oklahoma City.\n\nOnce in New York, they rent several rooms in Carnegie Hall with Madame Dakharova, a ballet coach. Emilia soon starts a relationship with a Russian playboy in the company, Yuri (Mikhail Baryshnikov). DeeDee runs into the former conductor of the company and has an affair with him, which causes conflict between Emilia and DeeDee. Meanwhile, Emma argues with Arnold, the choreographer, about giving her a better role in his new ballet, which he refuses and leads Emma to suggest Emilia for the role instead. It is also revealed Emma has been seeing a married man, Carter. During rehearsal, Emilia has an argument with Arnold and storms out, going to a bar and getting drunk. She then shows up for the performance that night still drunk and Emma takes care of her, which angers DeeDee. Emilia suffers when she sees Yuri getting involved with another dancer, Carolyn.\n\nEmma and DeeDee eventually enter into major conflict. DeeDee resents that Emma dotes on Emilia, when she has criticized DeeDee for choosing family life over her career while Emma chose not to have children. DeeDee accuses Emma of telling her to get pregnant and have Wayne's baby so Emma could play the lead in \"Anna Karenina\", which Emma later admits is true.\n\nEventually, misunderstandings are settled, with Emma and DeeDee working things out after a physical altercation. Emilia is announced as the star of the next season, and she and Yuri make up and agree to a professional partnership and nothing more. Deedee decides she is content with her life and the decision she made to leave professional ballet to have a family. Emma accepts that her performing days are numbered and she must embrace a different role within the company. DeeDee and Emma step onto the stage and reminisce together.\n\nA number of actresses were offered the roles of Emma and DeeDee, including Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, and Doris Day.\n\nBancroft had no previous dance experience, while MacLaine had started her career as a dancer of ballet and other types. She appeared on Broadway performing in the musicals \"Me and Juliet\" and \"The Pajama Game\".\n\nThe title \"The Turning Point\" is a double entendre, meaning a big change in a person's life and being on pointe.\n\nChoreography for the film was done by Alvin Ailey and George Balanchine.\n\nIsabel Mirrow Brown and Nora Kaye were childhood friends. Their parents had immigrated from Russia around the same time and they lived in the same New York City brownstone building. Kaye was a few years older than Mirrow and encouraged her to train. Nora Kaye was in a relationship with Jerome Robbins in the early 1950s, but they never married, focusing on their careers instead. Robbins was also a known bisexual.\n\nIsabel Mirrow danced with the American Ballet Theatre from 1947 until 1953. Nora was with the company from its inception in 1939 until 1951, and later returned in a leadership role. Unlike the film, Isabel did not get pregnant while she was with the company; however, during this time Isabel married fellow dancer Kelly Brown, who was widely sought after. Lucia Chase was the head of the company when Isabel and Nora were there.\n\nKaye continued to dance in New York with other companies and became a more prominent figure in the ballet world, while Isabel had stopped performing to marry and have children. Their first child, Leslie Browne, born in 1957, was Nora Kaye's goddaughter. Kaye went on to marry director Herbert Ross in 1959. The two couples were close friends, along with Arthur Laurents. Kelly Brown, Ross, Kaye, and Laurents all worked together in the Broadway musical \"I Can Get It for You Wholesale\" in 1962. In his autobiography, Laurents wrote that in the 1940s he had a sexual relationship with Nora Kaye.\n\nIn 1965, an opportunity to run a dance studio opened up, and Kelly Brown decided to move his family to Phoenix, Arizona (changed to Oklahoma City in the film). By this time he and his wife had aged out of performing. Isabel Mirrow Brown was not thrilled to leave her native New York for Arizona, and the move caused strain in their marriage. When their daughter Leslie auditioned and was accepted to train back in New York in the School of American Ballet (SAB), Isabel moved back to New York to watch over Leslie, who was still a teenager. The film depicts Isabel's experience entering back into the dance world after living in Phoenix and having four children (three in the film). In real life she eventually divorced Kelly Brown, who died in 1981 at age 52.\n\nWhile in Arizona the Browns had kept in touch with their friends Nora and Herbert. Later in the mid 1970s, a script based on the Brown family was developed by Arthur Laurents. Ross directed the film and co-produced with his wife. Ross, Laurents, and Kaye never had children and took a special interest in Leslie Browne as she grew older.\n\nThe script was a fictionalized version of the Browns' life and the long friendship between Isabel and Nora. The fictional parts primarily concern the character Yuri, who was created as a love interest for Emilia. Originally, the ballerina Gelsey Kirkland, who was at the height of her fame at the time and dating Mikhail Baryshnikov (Yuri), was offered the role of Emilia. She rejected the role as she was dealing with substance abuse issues at the time and she \"wanted no part of Hollywood\". Ross then decided that Leslie Browne, who was nineteen at the time, would be able to portray a fictionalized version of herself in the film. In real life, Leslie had just joined ABT in 1976 and was experiencing the same things she portrayed on screen. Leslie had added an \"e\" to her last name as her stage name to sound more feminine after being mistaken as a man in a playbill.\n\nThe script changed the family name from Brown to Rodgers, and all the first names except for their son Ethan Brown. The real-life Ethan Brown later became a principal dancer with the American Ballet Theatre, retiring from performing in 2004; he now teaches. In real life, the Browns had another son, Kelly Brown II, who danced as a child but did not train professionally like his siblings and later became a film producer. Their other daughter, Elizabeth Brown (born 1959), was also a dancer, unlike in the film, and was accepted into SAB a year after Leslie. Nora Kaye died of cancer in 1987 at age 67. After the film, Leslie Browne went on to become principal dancer with the American Ballet Theatre in New York City from 1986 until 1993 and now teaches ballet. Her mother Isabel continued to be associated with New York Ballet and she died in August 2014 at the age of 86.\n\nHerbert Ross later directed two more dance-themed films, \"Nijinsky\" (1980) and \"Dancers\" (1987), both of which also feature Leslie Browne.\n\nArthur Laurents claimed an important subplot regarding Wayne's homosexuality in the original script was cut from the film by Herbert Ross and his wife. This was the reason why Wayne's character's development does not progress steadily throughout the film.\n\nVincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" called it the film an \"entertaining new movie, an old-fashioned backstage musical transplanted to the world of ballet by three people who not only know it but also love it, sentimental clichés and all.\" Arthur D. Murphy of \"Variety\" declared it \"one of the best films of this era. It's that rare example of synergy in which every key element is excellent and the ensemble is an abaolute triumph.\" Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, \"In a movie year that will be remembered as the year of the science-fiction special effect, it is refreshing to see a film such as 'The Turning Point,' which offers another kind of excitement: the pleasure of following a story you can't easily anticipate.\" Charles Champlin of the \"Los Angeles Times\" stated, \"The performances by Bancroft and MacLaine are stunning, and both are at Academy Award level ... 'The Turning Point' is a handsome, thoughtful, well-spoken and emotionally holding piece of stylish entertainment.\" Gary Arnold of \"The Washington Post\" called the film \"enormously appealing\" and \"an authentic breakthrough-throwback: a vividly enacted depiction of the conflicts between strong, capable, conscious, willful women.\" Pauline Kael of \"The New Yorker\" wrote, \"As a device, the turning point (like that synthetic summer when adolescent heroes grow into men) is so mechanical it's an exposed construction ... [Laurents] writes sodden, expository dialogue in which people are forever revealing truths to each other and then explaining those truths—'The Turning Point' comes with its own footnotes.\"\n\nThe film currently holds a score of 64% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 25 reviews, with an average rating of 6.18/10. The consensus reads, \"\"The Turning Point\" is a handsomely-made resuscitation of Old Hollywood melodramas with a compelling duo at its center, but the formulaic script keeps this story from realizing its symphonic potential.\"\n\nThe film was nominated for 11 Academy Awards, but despite those nominations, the film won no awards. Along with \"The Color Purple\", it shares the record of receiving the most Oscar nominations without a single win. \n\n\n\n"}

He also took to sketching the surrounding countryside during his off hours.\n\nTryon sold his first painting in 1870. After exhibiting and selling work locally, he successfully exhibited at the National Academy of Design in 1873. His artistic convictions affirmed, Tryon married Alice Belden, quit his job at the bookstore and became a full-time artist. Some of his first works from this period are seascapes and harbor views executed in a luminist manner. Soon after, however, Tryon's style shifted towards the Barbizon school, which was then becoming popular among American artists. He may have been influenced by the works of George Inness and Alexander Helwig Wyant.\n\nIn 1876 Tryon decided to advance his skills through a formal study of art. He sold all of his paintings at auction and, with the help of a benefactor, traveled to France with his wife. He enrolled in the atelier of Jacquesson de la Chevreuse, and took classes at the École des Beaux-Arts. He also received instruction from Charles-François Daubigny, Henri Harpignies, and Jean Baptiste-Antoine Guillemet. Impressionism was blossoming in France all around Tryon, but he was not swayed by the new style and remained comfortably within the realm of the Barbizon school.\n\nTryon traveled and sketched Europe with his wife, and met Abbott Handerson Thayer and his wife with whom he became friends. He returned to the United States in 1881 and settled in New York City where he taught and painted landscapes. In New York, Tryon became friends with artists Robert Swain Gifford and Thomas Dewing. He became an early member of the Society of American Artists and continued to exhibit paintings to the National Academy of Design. He also became a member of the American Water Color Society and the National Institute of Arts and Letters (now The American Academy of Arts and Letters).\n\nOn the advice of Gifford, Tryon and his wife built a summer house in South Dartmouth, Massachusetts in 1887. Though he would continue to spend each winter in New York City, South Dartmouth became Tryon's home for the rest of his life. The coastal area appealed to Tryon's aesthetic sensibilities and allowed him to indulge in fishing, his favorite pastime.\n\nBy the late 1880s Tryon, working most often in oils, began painting landscapes in what would become his mature and iconic style. Tryon's paintings typically feature a group or broken row of trees in the middle distance, often colored in an autumnal hue, separating a glowing sky above and a foreground marsh or pasture below. He also continued to paint the sea in his mature career, often employing pastel to show a bare expanse of water, sky and beach in various weather and light. He exhibited his works nationally but tended to favor The Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia and the Montross Gallery in New York.\n\nA Detroit industrialist, Charles Lang Freer, first bought a painting by Tryon in 1889 and became his most important patron. Freer eventually bought dozens of Tryon's paintings, including many of his best works, and worked closely with Tryon in the interior design of his Detroit home. Freer, a major collector of Asian art and works by James McNeill Whistler, went on to establish the Freer Gallery of Art, part of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC, where many works by Tryon can be seen today.\n\nHe took the first prize for his painting \"Salt-Marsh, December\" at the Tennessee Centennial Exposition that was held in Nashville, Tennessee in 1897. He is described in the \"Fine Art Catalogue\" which is copyrighted by Theodore Cooley as follows: \"William Tryon is an American landscape painter whose pictures are greatly sought for their delicacy of coloring and refinement of feeling. A pupil of Daubdigny, he is, like that artist, a painter of country life - the idyllic rusticity of apple trees in bloom, of waving cornfields, of shining valleys and streams rippling gently to the sea. He is especially fine in the silvery-gray atmosphere.\"\n\nHe went on to win the Carnegie Prize at the Carnegie Exhibition of 1908 at the Carnegie Museum of Art.\n\nIn addition to his painting, Tryon taught at Smith College from 1886 to 1923, visiting part-time to critique students' work and, late in his career, establishing the Tryon Gallery of Art. He died of cancer in South Dartmouth on July 1, 1925.\n\nDwight William Tryon's papers can be found at the Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M. Sackler Gallery Archives in Washington, D.C. Charles Lang Freer, founder of the Freer Gallery of Art, was a primary patron of Tryon. The collection includes correspondence, photographs, a sketchbook, and newspaper clippings.\n\n\n"}

It was released as the lead single from the album by Parlophone on 3 November 2003. The song was written by Minogue, Dan Carey, Emilíana Torrini, and produced by Carey, Torrini, and Sunnyroads. \"Slow\" is an electropop and synth-pop song in which Minogue invites a man to \"slow down\" and dance with her.\n\nUpon its release, \"Slow\" was acclaimed by music critics, many of whom praised Minogue's sensual and seductive vocals. At the 47th Grammy Awards ceremony, the song received a nomination in the category of \"Best Dance Recording\". Commercially, the song was a success and peaked at number one on the charts of countries like Australia, Denmark, Romania, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The song also reached number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot Dance Club Songs in the United States. In Australia, the song was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for sales of 70,000 units.\n\nAn accompanying music video for the song was shot in Barcelona, Spain, and features Minogue singing the song while sunbathing next to the Piscina Municipal de Montjuïc swimming pool. For additional promotion, Minogue performed the song on a number of television shows. Since its release, the song has been performed by Minogue on all of her concert tours to date, with the exception of the Anti Tour. In 2012, Minogue named \"Slow\" as her favourite song from her music career.\n\n\"Slow\" was written by Kylie Minogue, Dan Carey, and Emilíana Torrini, and produced by Carey, Torrini, and Sunnyroads. In 2009, Torrini explained how she was approached for writing the song, saying \"It was like I had just accidentally walked into the line of fire with, \"Hey! You There! It was all quite surreal. I still think Kylie's people were trying to call Jamelia, and they just got the wrong number. It'd be much more funny if that is how it actually happened\". Musically, the song is an eighties-inspired electropop and synth-pop track. It utilises a very simple and \"minimalist\" style of production and was described as an \"electro-pop/disco fusion with percolating crackle-and-pop beats and sugary vocal overdubs\" by Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine. Additionally, it contains elements of electroclash and club music. Through the lyrics of the song, Minogue urges a man, whom she meets at a club, to \"slow down\" and dance with her. According to Minogue, the lyrics of the song are about \" how time and space have a different meaning when you meet someone\". She further said that she \"loved the way the song had this push-pull effect; the musical and lyrical combination gives you a sense of that\".\n\nIn late 2012, \"Slow\" was re-recorded by Minogue for inclusion in her orchestral compilation album \"The Abbey Road Sessions\". On the album, Minogue reworked 16 of her past songs with an orchestra, which, according to Nick Levine from BBC Music, \"re-imagine them without the disco glitz and vocal effects\". \"Slow\" is approached with a more jazz and trip hop influenced take, with Minogue again delivering sultry and seductive vocals.\n\n\"Slow\" was released as the lead single from Minogue's ninth studio album \"Body Language\", by Parlophone, on 3 November 2003. The cover art of the single, as well as other promotion shoots related to the album, which was shot by fashion photographers Mert and Marcus, show Minogue striking a pose in a black and white striped crop top, which reveals her midriff, and low-cut pants. Her appearance is similar to that of French actress and singer Brigitte Bardot, who was regarded as the \"first foreign-language star ever to attain a level of international success comparable to America's most popular homegrown talents\" and one of the best known sex symbols of the 1950s and 1960s, frequently cited as the \"archetypal sex kitten\" and \"sex goddess\". Minogue described the promotion shoots as \"the perfect mix of coquette, kitten and rock 'n' roll\", and revealed that \"We shot it on location in the South of France, so it was [easy to] channel the spirit of [Brigitte] Bardot. She's a great iconic reference, particularly that period where she was working with Serge Gainsbourg\".\n\n\"Slow\" was critically acclaimed by music critics. Ethan Brown from \"New York\" praised the production of the song and commented \"Everything at the top of the pops should sound as good as Kylie Minogue's \"Slow\"\". He further felt that most of the songs on \"Body Language\" \"mimic its sound, [though] none of the other songs on \"Body Language\" come close to the achievement of \"Slow\" and concluded that \"\"Slow\" should be a template for pop singers who fancy themselves aesthetes\". Adrien Begrand from PopMatters commented that the song was \"one of the strongest singles\" of Minogue's career, praising her minimalistic approach on the song and its simple arrangement. The \"Spin\" magazine review of the song complimented Minogue's vocals, saying that they will \"bring all the boys to the yard\". Eric Seguy from Stylus Magazine favoured Minogue's demanding vocals, saying that the listener \"is open to Kylie’s demands, and willing to resort to any means necessary to impress her\". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine felt that the song is one the \"few of the tracks on \"Body Language\" approach(ing) the club-thumping zeal of \"Fever\"\". Chris True from AllMusic picked the song as an album highlight of \"Body Language\". Olive Pometsey from \"GQ\" deemed it Minogue's best and most \"seductive\" track, concluding that \"featuring breathy vocals over seductive synths, it's the kind of song that would soundtrack that moment when you accidentally lock eyes with a hot stranger in a club perfectly [...] is indeed a slower track, but don't write it off that reason\".\n\n\"The Abbey Road Sessions\"' version of the song also generated a favourable response. Tim Sendra from AllMusic enjoyed the \"sultry trip-hop take\" on the song and picked it as a highlight on the album. Nick Levine from BBC Music felt that \"Slow\" received the \"most startling makeover\" on the album, and described it as a \"slinky jazz shuffle, complete with vampish vocal performance\". Annie Zaleski from \"The A.V. Club\" appreciated the song's graceful nature, calling it a \"slinky come-on\". Philip Matusavage from MusicOMH appreciated the song's jazz influences, noting that it \"suggests that Kylie and jazz could make for great things\". Jeff Katz from Idolator singled out the song as the \"Most Surprising Reworking\" on the album. Jude Rogers from \"The Quietus\", however, felt that the song does not \"respond well to this (orchestral) treatment\".\n\nSal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine included \"Slow\" on his list of \"Top 10 Singles & Videos of 2004\" at number five, calling it \"one of the hottest tracks of the year.\" At the 2004 Ivor Novello Awards ceremony, \"Slow\" received a nomination in the categories \"Best Contemporary Song\" and \"International Hit Of The Year\", but lost the awards to Amy Winehouse's song \"Stronger Than Me\" and Dido's song \"White Flag\", respectively. At the 47th Grammy Awards ceremony held in the year 2005, \"Slow\" was nominated for \"Best Dance Recording\", but lost to Britney Spears's song \"Toxic\", which Ironically was originally written for Minogue. In order to celebrate Valentine's Day on 14 February 2012, UK copyright collection society and performance rights organisation PRS for Music compiled a list of the top ten \"sexy songs\" and placed \"Slow\" on the top of the list. In 2012, Minogue picked \"Slow\" as her all-time favourite song from her in music. Writing for the \"Herald Sun\", Cameron Adams placed it at number 5 on his list of the singer's best songs in honor of her 50th birthday, calling it \"'Can't Get You Out of My Head's emo cousin — also with a deceptively simple electronic pulse, but taking a much darker tone [...] vocally Kylie moves from detached to carnal in the space of a verse, and somehow [\"Slow\"] sounds like everything and nothing is happening all at once\".\n\nIn Minogue's native country Australia, \"Slow\" entered and peaked at number one on the Australian Singles Chart, spending a total of 11 weeks on the chart. In this territory, the song was later certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association for sales of 70,000 units. In Austria, the song entered the Austrian Singles Chart at number 24 and peaked at number 20, spending a total of 13 weeks on the chart. In the Dutch-speaking Flanders region of Belgium, the song entered the Ultratop chart at number 15 and peaked at number nine, spending a total of 10 weeks on the chart. In Canada, the song peaked at number six on the Canadian Singles Chart. In Denmark, the song entered and peaked at number one on the Danish Singles Chart, spending a total of nine weeks on the chart. In France, the song entered and peaked at number 45 on the French Singles Chart, spending a total of 18 weeks on the chart. In Germany, the song peaked at number eight on the German Singles Chart. In Italy, the song entered the Italian Singles Chart at number nine and peaked at number six, spending a total of eight weeks on the chart. In New Zealand, the song entered the New Zealand Singles Chart at number 10 and peaked at number nine, spending a total of six weeks on the chart. \"Slow\" also debuted at number one in Spain.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the song debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart, becoming Minogue's seventh number one single in the region. It earned her a record for being the female artist for spending the longest duration as a UK chart topper. As of today, it is her last single to reach number one in the country. The single remained in the top ten for two weeks and in the top hundred for fourteen weeks. In the United States, \"Slow\" peaked at numbers 91 and one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart and Hot Dance Club Songs chart, respectively. It is Minogue's last entry on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart, to date.\n\nThe accompanying music video for \"Slow\" was directed by Baillie Walsh and choreographed by Michael Rooney. The video was shot in Barcelona, Spain, and begins with a scene of a man diving into the Piscina Municipal de Montjuïc swimming pool and coming out of its edge, where a number of very lightly beachwear-clad people are sunbathing. Minogue stands out in a series of different zoom central shots lying on a sky-blue towel wearing a dark blue bodyhugging Balenciaga dress. The next scenes of the video capture her singing the song through different camera angles, particularly during the chorus when the camera angle shifts to a \"bird's eye\" view and show Minogue amid beach models performing synchronised choreography to the dance beats. A reviewer from District MTV commented that the video showed that \"synchronised sun bathing is more fun than it sounds\". Ben Taylor from \"Swide Magazine\" included the video in his list of Minogue's \"Best Music Video Moments\". Used for promoting the song, the video premiered earlier than the song's release date, on 21 October 2003. Minogue talked about the video, saying:\n\n\"The video is set in Barcelona at the Olympic Diving site. I lie down for the whole video, which I thought was a very cunning plan. But then I ended up having to sing directly into the camera when the sun was right next it, so tears were streaming down my face! Videos always have a painful moment. It's either too hot or it's too cold or there's always something. That's part of the fun, I guess\"\n\nMinogue performed \"Slow\" on 6 November 2003, at the 2003 MTV Europe Music Awards. Since its release, \"Slow\" has been featured on all of Minogue's concert tour set lists, with the exception of the Anti Tour. In 2003, she performed the song on the one-night only concert Money Can't Buy, which was used to promote \"Body Language\" and was held at major entertainment venue Hammersmith Apollo in London. In 2005, she performed the song on her . Minogue was unable to complete the tour as she was diagnosed with early breast cancer and had to cancel the Australian leg of the tour. After undergoing treatment and recovery, she resumed the concert tour in the form of in 2007. In 2008, she performed the song on the KylieX2008 tour, which was launched to promote her tenth studio album \"X\". The show was split in five acts and \"Slow\" was featured on the fourth act entitled \"Xposed\".\n\nIn 2009, she performed the song on the For You, for Me tour, which was her first concert tour in North America. In 2011, she performed a jazz-oriented version of the song on the , which was launched to promote her eleventh studio album \"Aphrodite\". In 2012, Minogue promoted \"The Abbey Road Sessions\" by performing on the \"BBC Proms in the Park\" at Hyde Park, London. During the event, she sang the orchestral version of \"Slow\". In 2014 and 2015, Minogue performed the song during her Kiss Me Once Tour and Kylie Summer 2015 Tour respectly. The performances employed a laser lighting display and featured a \"Matrix-style\" break-dance routine. For the Golden Tour in 2018-19, Minogue performed a \"leather-bar version\" of the song; she was dressed in an all-leather ensamble and was surrounded by a group of motorbike-riding men. Writing for news.com.au, Nick Bond felt the performance showcased the singer's ability to \"breathe new life into some of her most inescapable hits via canny new arrangements\". For the Summer 2019 Tour, Kylie performs the song in a mash up with David Bowie’s 1980 song “Fashion\", which she also performed on \"The Graham Norton Show\" that November.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: The \"Radio Slave Mix\" is 10:27 in its full length and can be found on a select few releases, notably the Australian CD2 release from above. In all other releases, the length had been shortened to 6:25.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2223732", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2223732", "title": "Ihsan", "text": "Ihsan\n\nIhsan ( \"ʾiḥsān\", also romanized \"ehsan\"), is an Arabic term meaning \"beautification\", \"perfection\" or \"excellence\" (Ara. \"husn\", meaning: beauty). It is a matter of taking one's inner faith (\"iman\") and showing it in both deed and action, a sense of social responsibility borne from religious convictions. In Islam, ihsan is the Muslim responsibility to obtain perfection, or excellence, in worship, such that Muslims try to worship God as if they see Him, and although they cannot see him, they undoubtedly believe that He is constantly watching over them. That definition comes from the Hadith of Gabriel in which Muhammad states, \"[Ihsan is] to worship God as though you see Him, and if you cannot see Him, then indeed He sees you\". (Al-Bukhari and Al-Muslim). According to prophet Muhammad Hadith \"God has written Ihsan on everything\".\n\nIhsan, meaning \"to do beautiful things\", is one of the three dimensions of the Islamic religion (Ara. \"ad-din\"): islam, iman and ihsan. In contrast to the emphases of \"islam\" (what one should do) and \"iman\" (why one should do), the concept of ihsan is primarily associated with intention. One who \"does what is beautiful\" is called a \"muhsin\". It is generally held that a person can only achieve true ihsan with the help and guidance of God, who governs all things. While traditionally Islamic jurists have concentrated on Islam and theologians on Iman, the Sufis have focused their attention on Ihsan.\n\nSome Islamic scholars explain ihsan as being the \"inner\" dimension of Islam whereas shariah is often described as the \"outer\" dimension:\nFrom the preceding discussion it should be clear that not every Muslim is a man or woman of faith (\"mu'min\"), but every person of faith is a \"muslim\". Furthermore, a Muslim who believes in all the principles of Islam may not necessarily be a righteous person, a doer of good (\"muhsin\"), but a truly good and righteous person is both a \"muslim\" and a true person of faith.\nIhsan \"constitutes the highest form of worship\" (\"ibadah\"). It is excellence in work and in social interactions. For example, ihsan includes sincerity during Muslim prayers and being grateful to parents, family, and God.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2223751", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2223751", "title": "The Sisterhood (gothic rock band)", "text": "The Sisterhood (gothic rock band)\n\nThe Sisterhood was a side project by Andrew Eldritch that recorded songs that he had intended for a second album by the Sisters of Mercy with guest musicians.\n\nAfter the March 1985 release of the first Sisters of Mercy album \"First and Last and Always\" the band prepared themselves for a follow-up. Eldritch: \"The next Sisters album was going to be called 'Left On Mission and Revenge'.\"\n\nSinger Andrew Eldritch saw the time ripe for a change of direction: \"I always wanted to do something different, because whatever we did it all eventually sounded the same.\" \"I wanted to find out how to record songs without any rock structures and especially without guitars.\"\n\nTogether with guitarist Wayne Hussey Eldritch went to Hamburg-Bramfeld during August and September 1985 to compose new material. Wayne Hussey: \"I went to Hamburg for a month with Andrew to try and write songs for the second Sisters album, and we came back with all my ideas rejected and Andrew's very skeletal.\" \"Andrew rejected all my songs and let me work on one single chord all the time: 'Here's my song – E minor!\"\n\nBack in England the band came together to rehearsals in October 1985, but the musical differences had become irreconcilable. Wayne Hussey: \"We got to doing the second album and Andrew said 'I'm not singing any of your songs.'\" \n\nEldritch: \"Then they said 'Well, okay, what are we gonna do for new songs?' And I said 'How about this, this and this' and, unfortunately, the first 'this' I cited had too many chords per minute and Craig said 'If that's the guitar line, I'm not playing it' and walked out. That was really that.\" \"The others didn't want to play my new songs, such as 'Torch' for instance. [...] The song has some unusual chord changes. Craig thought it was crap, he said 'I'm not playing it, I'm going home.' And there he stayed.\"\n\nHussey: \"Craig walked out of rehearsal and a day later I did.\" \n\nThe music press reported the break-up of the band on Saturday, 2 November 1985: \"The Sisters of Mercy were down to singer Andrew Eldritch and his faithful drum machine Doktor Avalanche this week after guitarist Wayne Hussey and bassist Craig Adams left the band. Although this has scuppered recording plans for a new album this month, Andrew now intends to record the same album in the New Year and could well be using Wayne as a session guitarist. The split was described as 'friendly' by a Merciful Release spokesperson. 'The cliché of musical differences would not be inappropriate. Wayne and Craig were unable to comprehend the direction the band was going.' Andrew has also approached former Gun Club bassist Patricia Morrison – now in Fur Bible – to play on the album, but it's not yet known whether Andrew will continue with the name Sisters of Mercy. Wayne and Craig are now reported to be getting their own band together.\"\n\nAndrew Eldritch: \"The people that are now the Mission and myself had an agreement, no one would use the name when the band went its separate ways.\" \"The band was good and successful, each of us could continue. The split came at a time when it wouldn't do us any damage.\"\n\nOn the very same day Eldritch made a phone call to bassist Patricia Morrison whose band Fur Bible was on a UK tour with Siouxsie and the Banshees at the time, and asked her to play on his planned album. Morrison: \"The day they fell apart he called me and said 'Will you do it?' and I said yes. [...] We had some tours set up, so I waited until that was cleared, then left.\"\n\nHussey and Adams, who like Eldritch remained under contract with WEA Records, booked some studio time at Slaughterhouse Recording Studios in Driffield at the end of October 1985, recorded a four-song demo tape, and set up a new band. But the demo tape was rejected by the record company who were not convinced by Hussey's singing talents.\n\nEldritch went into the studio at the tail end of 1985 to produce the debut single of James Ray and the Performance for his Merciful Release label. James Ray: \"The Sisterhood project arose during the recording of 'Mexico Sundown Blues'.\" \n\nWhile Eldritch was in the studio, Hussey and Adams, who had taken over the Sisters' roadcrew and equipment, announced their debut concert for 20 January 1986, which they were going to play under the new name the Sisterhood.\n\nEldritch was alarmed: \"They began to claim rights to [the Sisters name], which patently had to be stopped. And when they wanted to be called the Sisterhood, there was nothing I could do but be the Sisterhood before them – the only way to kill that name was to use it, then kill it.\" \"Warners thought they could have two bands on the same label with pretty much the same name.\"\n\nEldritch decided to secure the rights to the Sisterhood name as quickly as possible. He registered a company under the name and prepared a record to be released on his own label. \n\nIn only five days Eldritch recorded a song called \"Giving Ground,\" which he co-wrote with Merciful Release manager Boyd Steemson and co-produced with Lucas Fox. Fox and Eldritch had met in the spring of 1985, when Fox was the stand-in drummer for Australian support band the Scientists on the Sisters of Mercy's UK tour. Eldritch recorded all instruments himself (guitar, bass, synthesizers and drum programming), while Fox programmed some additional percussion tracks.\n\nThe single contained two different mixes of the song, Eldritch's original instrumental \"Giving Ground (AV)\" (5:45 min) on the b-side and the vocal remix \"Giving Ground (RSV)\" (4:50 min) on the a-side. 'AV' and 'RSV' are explained on the official Sisters of Mercy website this way: \"The 'Authorised Version' of 'Giving Ground' is Andrew's original version, and the 'Revised Standard Version' is the version developed by colleagues at Merciful Release and subsequently adopted as the standard version. 'AV' and 'RSV' are well-known versions of the Bible.\" \n\nBecause Eldritch, as an artist, was under contract to WEA Records, he could not sing on the record, otherwise WEA would have had an option on the recording. James Ray: \"He asked me and I did the vocals, as easy as that\". \nMerciful Release announced the single's release with a press statement: \"From among the forces allied to Merciful Release we bring you the Sisterhood. capturing (in this instance) the musical bile of Andrew Eldritch, and introducing James Ray and the Performance ... of whom more soon.\"\n\nThe single was released as planned on 20 January 1986, the same day that Hussey and Adams played their debut concert in London as the Sisterhood. The press hype about the two conflicting parties made the single enter the UK Indie Chart on 8 February, where it got to no. 1 on 15 February 1986. The reviews in the music press were unanimously negative, and even James Ray later declared: \"It's a terrible track.\" \n\nHussey and Adams had to give up the Sisterhood name. A radio session for the Janice Long Evening Show on BBC Radio 1 on 10 February was broadcast under the provisional name of the Wayne Hussey and Craig Adams Band, and at the end of February 1986 the new name the Mission was announced.\n\nAnother Eldritch press release commented: \"We assume that their choice of name is entirely unconnected with the forthcoming Andrew Eldritch album that for some months has had the working title \"Left on Mission and Revenge\".\" \n\nOn 2 March 1986 the Mission played in Birmingham. Wayne Hussey: \"The majority of the songs we've been doing in the set so far are my songs that Andrew rejected for the Sisters' second album. It's ironic cos he saw us at Birmingham and told us how good he thought the songs were.\" \n\nSounds magazine reported on 20 February 1986 that \"a new 12-inch EP called 'This Corrosion' will soon be in the shops, featuring the same line-up but with the addition of a mysterious and so far undisclosed American vocalist.\" This 12 inch single even appeared in German music paper adverts as \"available soon\". \n\nJames Ray: \"So during the recording of ['Mexico Sundown Blues'] we made and released 'Giving Ground'. We then spent weeks on what was to be the Sisterhood's second single, 'This Corrosion', but Eldritch decided he was going to use it to kickstart the Sisters Mk II.\"\n\nRecording took place at Fairview Studios near Hull with in-house engineer John Spence. American vocalist Alan Vega, who had made friends with the Sisters of Mercy in 1983, and undertook a solo tour through the UK and Europe during February and March 1986, recorded one version of the song, other vocal takes featuring James Ray and Andrew Eldritch are in existence as well. \n\nThe projected 12 inch EP remained unreleased, instead the song \"This Corrosion\" in 1987 became the Sisters of Mercy's comeback single.\n\nIn March 1986, the Mission began negotiations with Phonogram Ltd. as WEA Records refused to release any material. So the band released the October 1985 demo tape in slightly re-recorded form as an independent single on 9 May 1986. The single (its b-side was titled \"Wake (RSV)\" as a nod to \"Giving Ground (RSV)\") promptly entered the UK Indie Chart at no. 1. WEA Records had to release the Mission from their contract.\n\nBoth Andrew Eldritch and the Mission still had a publishing contract with RCA Records from their days in the Sisters of Mercy. A sum of £25,000 for one studio album was payable for the year of 1986 in an Advance against royalties deal, so RCA decided to split up the money to the two concerned parties. \n\nEldritch decided to claim the whole sum for himself by being first to compose, produce and release a studio album, much in the same way as he did with the \"Giving Ground\" single. Again he didn't appear as a vocalist, so he could release the album on his own label without having to offer it to WEA Records: \"They thought it was great that I called myself the Sisterhood while they still had the Sisters of Mercy, so they didn't have to back me at all. I had to put out the album on Merciful Release, but it gave me free rein.\"\n\nEldritch and Lucas Fox returned to Fairview Studios. Merciful Release office manager Boyd Steemson: \"Basically, we had some extra tracks around, so Andrew quickly put some songs together.\" \n\nJames Ray: \"I wasn't involved too much with the album, as it was taking ages for Eldritch to formulate any concrete ideas, and I wanted to be writing my own stuff. I personally think the album transpired to cash in on the sales of the single.\"\n\n\"Giving Ground\" was included as an extended remix on the album, the only track featuring James Ray.\n\nJames Ray: \"Lucas Fox done the spoken word stuff.\" \"If I remember correctly I advised Andrew on how Lucas Fox should approach his vocals and that was quite enough for me.\" \n\nLucas Fox does the vocal parts on \"Colours\", \"Finland Red, Egypt White\" and \"Rain from Heaven\". The text of \"Finland Red, Egypt White\" comes from an arms dealer's catalogue for the AK-47 rifle, while the title cites the country code for blank cartridges. James Ray remembers Norman Cook, then bassist of local band the Housemartins, having done a mix of the track that remains unreleased. \"Rain from Heaven\" with its choral singing seems to have been one of the tracks Eldritch intended for the \"Left on Mission and Revenge\" album, as he later mentioned how \"Wayne and Craig had said those choral singings were insane.\"\n\nPatricia Morrison got her first opportunity to collaborate with Eldritch, but her only verified contribution to the album is one spoken passage on the opening track \"\"Jihad\"\". Eldritch: \"So I asked Patricia to come to the studio and told her: 'Speak this – Two-Five-Zero-Zero-Zero'. It took the Mission two months to realise the meaning of those words. Two months!\" i.e. £25,000.\n\nAlan Vega gets a credit on the album cover but it remains unknown whether he made any contributions to the recording. He was possibly part of the \"Chorus of Vengeance\" on the track \"Rain from Heaven\".\n\nIn July 1986 Eldritch put the album out on his Merciful Release label to unanimously negative press reactions. The album did not accomplish its purpose, as RCA Records dissolved the publishing contract with Eldritch and decided to keep the Mission instead. \n\nTony Perrin, the Mission's manager: \"I think Eldritch perpetuated it longer than anyone else bothered. We'd still get letters from his lawyers ages after but nothing would ever come of it. The whole thing cost us legal bills and that's all, the rumours about big losses by us were all rubbish, it was never going to court.\" \n\nAndrew Eldritch later said about the album: \"The Sisterhood album was a weapon in this corporate war. That's why I called it \"Gift\". [in German: poison] [...] But I still like the record. It's weird but it's fine.\" \"I see it as a techno record. Or what I thought to be techno at the time.\"\n\nThe official Sisters of Mercy website comments: \"The Sisterhood album has become a classic; it parallelled the New Beat of the Continental avant-garde that eventually spawned Techno.\"\n\n\nThe final episode of BBC drama \"Spooks\"' seventh series references this album. The Russian code broadcast on a Cold War number station is \"2.5.0.0.2.5. Finland Red, Egypt White. It is twice blest. It is twice blest. Rain from Heaven\". This code activates a Russian sleeper agent in Faversham (also a reference to the Sisters of Mercy as the Faversham is a pub in Leeds that \"was where goth's dark lords, the Sisters of Mercy, would hold court\"), Kent to collect a hidden portable nuclear weapon to be taken to Grosvenor Square in London and detonated at 15:00hrs. Also, while trying to get to London Bridge through an unused underground tube tunnel, Lucas North says the sentence \"What is lost can never be found\"; a line from the \"Giving Ground\" track.\n"}

The unity of science thesis is often associated with a framework of levels of organization in nature, where physics is the most basic, chemistry the level above physics, biology above chemistry, sociology above biology, and so forth. Further, cells, organisms, and cultures are all biological, but they represent three different levels of biological organization.\n\nIt has also been suggested (for example, in Jean Piaget's 1918 work \"Recherche\") that the unity of science can be considered in terms of a circle of the sciences, where logic is the foundation for mathematics, which is the foundation for mechanics and physics, and physics is the foundation for chemistry, which is the foundation for biology, which is the foundation for sociology, the moral sciences, psychology, and the theory of knowledge, and the theory of knowledge is based on logic.\n\nThe unity of science thesis is famously clarified and tentatively argued for by Ludwig von Bertalanffy in \"General System Theory: A New Approach to Unity of Science\" (1951) and by Paul Oppenheim and Hilary Putnam in \"Unity of Science as a Working Hypothesis\" (1958). It is famously argued against by Jerry Fodor in \"Special Sciences (Or: The Disunity of Science as a Working Hypothesis)\" (1974), by Paul Feyerabend in \"Against Method\" (1975) and later works, and by John Dupré in \"The Disunity of Science\" (1983) and \"The Disorder of Things: Metaphysical Foundations of the Disunity of Science\" (1993).\n\n"}

He worked in oils and watercolors, often depicting scenes of rural life in Canada. He was highly influenced by the French Barbizon school of painting.\n\nWalker was born in 1858 to parents Thomas and Jeanne Maurice Walker. Thomas Walker emigrated in 1856 from Yorkshire, England, to Listowel, Ontario, with his wife of French and English heritage. Having some wealth, Thomas purchased land for lumber in Midwestern Ontario and Horatio was raised in relative comfort. His interest in art may originate from his father who crafted small figures as a hobby, and both his father and the local school teacher encouraged drawing as a pastime.\n\nIn 1870, on Walker's 12th birthday, his father brought him to Quebec City, Quebec, for the first time. His father made occasional business trips to the city as part of his timber business. During this sojourn, they visited the Île d'Orléans, in search of pine timber. Walker made subsequent visits to Quebec City during the following years. His formal schooling ended at the Listowel Public School in 1872; he never went on to pursue formal academic training in art. At the age of 15, Walker moved to Toronto, Ontario to apprentice with the photographic firm Notman and Fraser. It was a fortunate opportunity, as several successful artists also worked there; Walker learned watercolour from Robert Gagnon, miniature portrait painting from John Fraser, and painting from Lucius O'Brien and Henri Perré.\n\nWalker was only at the firm for three years until he moved to the United States of America for uncertain reasons. Writing in 1928, Hector Charlesworth suggested that Walker was \"chucked down the stairs\" and fired for quarrelling with a family relative. However, it is more likely that Walker travelled to Philadelphia for the American Centennial in 1876, an exhibition where Notman and Fraser won the international award, which privileged the firm with exclusive photographic rights for the celebrations. Ultimately, Walker may have decided to stay and pursue painting.\n\nDuring the period of Walker's life around 1878, he would have become familiar with the painters of the Barbizon school, which were at the time, exhibited in American museums and galleries. In 1880, Walker made an extended trip to Europe to learn more about the Barbizon methods, and its agrarian subject matter, that would come to define his painting for the rest of his life.\n\nWhat happened with Walker during the two following years remains vague, but in 1878, he opened a studio in New York City. During the 1880s, Walker's parents moved to Rochester, New York, and Walker participated in the founding of the Rochester Art Club. A further sign of Walker's growing success was an invitation to join the American Watercolour membership in 1882. In 1883 he married Jeanette Pretty (d. 1938) of Toronto. They had two children, Alice (1884–1891) and Horatio Jr. (1886–1910). It was sometime during this period that Walker purchased a residence on Île d'Orléans in the village of Sainte-Pétronille. From now on until his retirement, Walker would spend his summers in Quebec and winters in his New York City studio.\n\nWalker's personal life was disastrous: his daughter died of diphtheria, his son of tuberculosis and his wife Jeanette, was committed to hospital permanently in 1914 due to paranoia. These tragedies do not seem to have influenced his painting; Walker's subject matter and style remained constant throughout his career without much variation.\n\nWalker was a member of several artists' organizations, including the American Watercolor Society (1882), the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts (associate member in 1883, full member in 1913), the Society of American Artists (1887), the National Academy of Design (associate member in 1890, full member in 1891), and the British Institute of Watercolours (1901). He was a founding member of the Canadian Art Club, which elected him as its president in 1915. In 1928 he officially retired and moved to Sainte-Pétronille, Quebec. He died there on September 27, 1938. Gallery L'Art français exhibited his works.\n\n\nHe was awarded honorary doctorates from the University of Toronto (1916) and Université Laval, Québec City (1938).\n\n\n\n\n"}

That is, if the samples come from non-normal distributions, then Bartlett's test may simply be testing for non-normality.

A New South Wales State of Origin and Australia international representative goal-kicking centre, he played his club football for the Illawarra Steelers and the Penrith Panthers, winning the 2003 NRL Premiership with the Panthers.\n\nGirdler was born in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.\n\nGirdler first played in the New South Wales Rugby League for the Illawarra Steelers in 1991, playing his first game from the bench in a 26–14 win over South Sydney at the Wollongong Showground. During his time at Illawarra, he struggled with injuries and with the likes of Paul McGregor and Brett Rodwell cemented as the Steelers centre pairing, received few chances to reach his full potential. As a result, he usually found himself playing on the for the Steelers, though in 1992, his form saw him play 20 games for Illawarra (12 in the centres) and take over the goal kicking duties from Rod Wishart. Girdler was the Steelers top point scorer in 1992, scoring 118 points from 8 tries and 43 goals from 66 attempts (65.15%)\n\nThis prompted a move to the Penrith Panthers in 1993 where he stayed for the rest of his career.\n\nIn 1997 he played three games for New South Wales in the Super League's Super League Tri-series. In the 1997 post season, Girdler was selected to tour England as part of the Super League only Australian team as a centre and goal kicker, playing two of the three matches of the Super League Test series against Great Britain.\n\nThe 1997 Super League season saw Girdler record his career best goal kicking figures when he kicked 76 goals from 82 attempts (92.68%) for the Panthers. With 197 points (11 tries, 76 goals and 1 field goal), Ryan Girdler was the highest point scorer for the Super League season (he finished one point clear of Cronulla's Mat Rogers). As this was the only SL season to be played in Australasia, this remains the all-time record number of points scored for the competition.\n\nFollowing Super League, Girdler's standing as one of the best centres in rugby league was cemented when he was then selected for New South Wales in State of Origin. As the Super League War had ended at the end of 1997 with the Super and Australian Rugby Leagues merging to form the National Rugby League, the 1998 State of Origin series saw players from both the SL and ARL available for Origin selection (prior to 1998, Origin selection had only been open to ARL aligned players from 1995–1997, though SL had their own 'Origin' in the form of the Tri-series which also included New Zealand).\n\nGirdler was selected for the Australian team to compete in the end of season 1999 Rugby League Tri-Nations tournament. In the final against New Zealand he played from the interchange bench in the Kangaroos' 22–20 victory at Auckland's Ericsson Stadium.\n\nIn 2000 Ryan set one of his many records at Penrith, kicking 78 goals in the season. In the 2000 State of Origin series he set records for most points in a game (32 in game 3) and most points in a series (52). Later that year Ryan was selected to play for the Kangaroos in the 2000 Rugby League World Cup. Ryan scored three tries and kicked 17 goals for a 46 points in total when Australia defeated Russia 110 to 4 at The Boulevard in Hull.\n\nIn 2002, Ryan was once again injured, a knee injury ruling him out for half the season, despite the injury, Ryan was able to set another record at the Penrith club, scoring 28 points in a match against Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles at Penrith Stadium in July.\n\nIn 2003 he was injured in the opening round and did not make a return until round 14. 2003 was the last year that Ryan would represent Australia, scoring the first try in a game against Wales, 76 to 4. That season the Panthers finished minor premiers and went on to the grand final. In the 2003 NRL grand final Ryan played in the centres and had to come from the field with a calf injury in the Panthers' victory over the Sydney Roosters. After that he went on the 2003 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France, helping Australia to victory over Great Britain in what would be the last time the two nations contested an Ashes series.\n\nHis last game was the Preliminary Final loss to the Canterbury Bulldogs who went on to win the 2004 NRL premiership.\n\nGirdler was the top point-scorer in 1997's Super League premiership season. During the 2000 State of Origin he scored 32 points in one game, equalling Dally Messenger's for most points in an interstate game set 89 years earlier in 1911. His tally of 1,690 first grade points is the 8th highest in history and he was the first player to score 100 tries and kick 500 goals (a feat subsequently emulated by Canterbury's Hazem El Masri and Parramatta's Luke Burt).\n\n\n\n\nGirdler was a regular on the rugby league television show \"The NRL Footy Show\", eventually gaining his own segment on the show in 2001 with a segment named \"Gone Fishin\" and then an occasional recurring segment from 2002 which is titled \"Their House\", a loose parody of Australian lifestyle program \"Our House\". He is a regular on Triple M's NRL coverage. He owns coffee shops trading as \"Girdlers\" in Dee Why and at Westfield Warringah Mall.\nHe has also rejoined the footy show as a co-host on the panel for its revamp in 2018.\n\n"}
{"id": "2223797", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2223797", "title": "Saethre–Chotzen syndrome", "text": "Saethre–Chotzen syndrome\n\nSaethre–Chotzen syndrome (SCS), also known as acrocephalosyndactyly type III, is a rare congenital disorder associated with craniosynostosis (premature closure of one or more of the sutures between the bones of the skull). This affects the shape of the head and face, resulting in a cone-shaped head and an asymmetrical face. Individuals with SCS also have droopy eyelids (ptosis), widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), and minor abnormalities of the hands and feet (syndactyly). Individuals with more severe cases of SCS may have mild to moderate mental retardation or learning disabilities. Depending on the level of severity, some individuals with SCS may require some form of medical or surgical intervention. Most individuals with SCS live fairly normal lives, regardless of whether medical treatment is needed or not.\n\nSCS presents in a variable fashion. The majority of individuals with SCS are moderately affected, with uneven facial features and a relatively flat face due to underdeveloped eye sockets, cheekbones, and lower jaw. In addition to the physical abnormalities, people with SCS also experience growth delays, which results in a relatively short stature. Although, most individuals with SCS are of normal intelligence, some individuals may have mild to moderate mental delays. More severe cases of SCS, with more serious facial deformities, occurs when multiple cranial sutures close prematurely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cranium consists of three main sections including the base of the cranium (occipital bone), the face (frontal bone), and the top (parietal bones) and sides (temporal bone) of the head. Most of the bones of the cranium are permanently set into place prior to birth. However, the temporal and parietal bones are separated by sutures, which remain open, allowing the head to slightly change in shape during childbirth. The cranial sutures eventually close within the first couple of years following birth, after the brain has finished growing.\n\nIn individuals with SCS, the coronal suture separating the frontal bones from the parietal bones, closes prematurely (craniosynostosis), occasionally even before birth. If the coronal suture closes asymmetrically or unilaterally, then the face and forehead will form unevenly, from side-to-side. People with SCS have pointy, tower-like heads because their brain is growing faster than their skull, resulting in increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and causing the top of the head and/or forehead to bulge out to allow for brain growth. The face appears uneven, particularly in the areas of the eyes and cheeks, and the forehead appears wide and tall.\n\nBecause of the abnormal forehead, there is less space for the normal facial features to develop. This results in shallow eye sockets and flat cheekbones. The shallow eye sockets make the eyes more prominent or bulging and cause the eyes to be more separated than normal (hypertelorism). The underdeveloped eye sockets, cheekbones, and lower jaw cause the face to appear flat. Furthermore, the minor downward slant of the eyes along with the drooping eyelids (ptosis) adds to the overall unevenness of the face.\n\nSCS is typically inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. However, on occasion, children with a microdeletion of 7p21 (chromosome containing the locus responsible for SCS) develop new abnormalities and typically show significant neurological abnormalities. An increased parental age may play a role in the development of new mutations and abnormalities.\n\nLinkage analysis and chromosomal rearrangement revealed the cause of SCS to be mutations in the TWIST gene (twist transcription factor gene) located on chromosome 7p21. The TWIST gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (b-HLH) transcription factor that controls head mesenchyme development as the cranial tube forms. More than 35 varying TWIST mutations involving the b-HLH domain of the protein have been identified in people with SCS. The mutations include missense, nonsense, and frameshift deletion/insertion mutations that either shorten or disrupt the b-HLH domain. Most individuals with SCS have a single large deletion in the region 7p21, which contains the region that codes for the TWIST gene.\n\nIn searching for the gene responsible for SCS, scientists at Johns Hopkins Children’s Center began studying the TWIST gene because its effects on mice. The TWIST gene in mice, functions in the development of the muscle and skeleton of the face, head, hands, and feet. Mice that were lacking both copies of the TWIST gene were spontaneously aborted prior to birth, and had serious deformities including abnormal limb and head defects and failure of the neural tube to properly close. However, mice with a single copy of the non-working TWIST gene survived. Further examination revealed that these mice had only minor skull, hand, and foot defects similar to those seen in SCS. The mouse TWIST gene is located on chromosome 12 in mice, which corresponds to the short arm of chromosome 7 in humans. With this information, scientists began to isolate and map the human TWIST gene on the short arm of human chromosome 7. They revealed that the human TWIST gene was in the same region that was absent in people with SCS. While looking for different mutations in the human TWIST gene, five different types of mutations were discovered in individuals with SCS. Since none of these mutations were seen in normal individuals who didn't have SCS, this provided enough evidence to conclude that the TWIST gene was the causative agent of SCS1. Researchers also studied the TWIST gene in \"Drosophila\" (fruit fly) in order to determine its function. They discovered that in the presence of two TWIST protein molecules combined together, the TWIST gene functions as a DNA transcription factor, meaning it binds to the DNA double-helix at specific locations in order to control which genes are \"turned on\" or activated. The majority of the identified mutations in the TWIST gene interfere with how the protein attaches to DNA, preventing the activation of other genes that would normally be turned on during fetal development.\n\nPrenatal diagnosis of Saethre-Chotzen Syndrome in high risk pregnancies is doable, but very uncommon and rarely performed. Furthermore, this is only possible if the mutation causing the disease has already been identified within the family genome. There are a few different techniques in which prenatal testing can be carried out. Prenatal testing is usually performed around 15–18 weeks, using amniocentesis to extract DNA from the fetus's cells. Prenatal testing can also be performed during weeks 10–12 using chorionic villus sampling (CVS) to extract DNA from the fetus. Recently, there has been an increased interest in utilizing ultrasound equipment in order to detect fetal skull abnormalities due to immature fusion of the cranial sutures.\n\nThe overall diagnosis of SCS is primarily based on clinical findings and observations based on dysmorphology examination (assessing structural defects) and radiographic evaluation (X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans).\n\nA clinical diagnosis of SCS can be verified by testing the TWIST1 gene (only gene in which mutations are known to cause SCS) for mutations using DNA analysis, such as sequence analysis, deletion/duplication analysis, and cytogenetics/ FISH analysis. Sequence analysis of exon 1 (TWIST1 coding region) provides a good method for detecting the frequency of mutations in the TWIST1 gene. These mutations include nonsense, missense, splice site mutation, and intragenic deletions/insertions. Deletion/duplication analysis identifies mutations in the TWIST1 gene that are not readily detected by sequence analysis. Common methods include PCR, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), and chromosomal microarray (CMA). Cytogenetic/FISH analysis attaches fluorescently labels DNA markers to a denatured chromosome and is then examined under fluorescent lighting, which reveals mutations caused by translocations or inversions involving 7p21. Occasionally, individuals with SCS have a chromosome translocation, inversion, or ring chromosome 7 involving 7p21 resulting in atypical findings, such as, increased developmental delay. Individuals with SCS, typically have normal brain functioning and rarely have mental impairments. For this reason, if an individual has both SCS and mental retardation, then they should have their TWIST1 gene screened more carefully because this is not a normal trait of SCS. Cytogenetic testing and direct gene testing can also be used to study gene/chromosome defects. Cytogenetic testing is the study of chromosomes to detect gains or losses of chromosomes or chromosome segments using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and/or comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Direct gene testing uses blood, hair, skin, amniotic fluid, or other tissues in order to find genetic disorders. Direct gene testing can determine whether an individual has SCS by testing the individual's blood for mutations in the TWIST1 gene.\n\nGenetic testing allows for a definitive diagnosis because it allows similar conditions to be differentiated from each other based on which gene is mutated. The following table contains conditions similar to SCS:\n\nThe physical abnormalities resulting from SCS are typically mild and only require a minor surgical procedure or no procedure at all. One of the common symptoms of SCS is the development of short (brachydactyly), webbed fingers and broad toes (syndactyly). These characteristics do not cause any problems to the function of the hands or feet, and thus, no medical procedure is required to fix the abnormalities, unless the patient requests it. Webbing of the fingers may affect the base of the fingers, resulting in delayed hand growth during childhood, but this contributes no functional impairments. Sometimes, individuals with SCS develop broad toes because the bones at the ends of the toes are duplicating themselves. This is especially seen in the big toe, but requires no surgical intervention because it doesn't negatively affect the overall function of the foot. Individuals with these toe abnormalities walk normally and can wear normal footwear.\n\nIn more severe cases, frequent surgeries and clinical monitoring are required throughout development. A child born with asymmetrical unilateral coronal synostosis should undergo cranioplasty within its first year of life in order to prevent increased intracranial pressure and to prevent progressive facial asymmetry. Cranioplasty is a surgical procedure to correct prematurely fused cranial bones. The surgery acts to reconstruct and reposition the bones and sutures in order to promote the most normal growth. Cranioplasty is necessary in order to continue to grow and is important for two main reasons. First of all, the skull needs to be able to accommodate the growing brain following childbirth, which it can't because the skull doesn't grow as fast as the brain as long as the sutures remain fused. This results in an increase in pressure surrounding the brain and inhibits the brain from growing, causing the individual to experience significant problems, and if left untreated can eventually lead to death. Secondly, cranioplasty may be required for appearance purposes. This is especially the case in individuals with asymmetrical unilateral coronal synostosis, which requires reconstructive surgery of the face and skull. If cranioplasty is not performed, especially in individuals with unilateral coronal synostosis, then facial asymmetry will get worse and worse over time, which is why cranioplasty should be performed as soon as possible.\n\nSurgery may also be required in individuals with vision problems. Vision problems usually arise due to a lack of space in the eye orbit and skull because of the abnormal bone structure of the face. Decreased space may also lead to abnormal or missing tear ducts and nerve damage. Reconstructive surgery is usually required in order to increase cranial space, correct tear duct stenosis, and/or correct ptosis of the eyelids in order to prevent amblyopia (lazy eye).\n\nMidfacial surgery may also be required during early childhood to correct respiratory problems, dental malocclusion, and swallowing difficulties. A cleft palate is also corrected with surgery, and may involve the use of tympanostomy tubes. If needed, an individual will undergo orthognathic treatment and/or orthodontic treatment after facial development is complete. Since hearing loss is frequently associated with SCS, it is recommended that audiology screening persist throughout childhood.\n\nAfter cranial reconstructive surgery, a child may be required to wear a molding helmet or some other form of head protection until the cranial bones set into place. This typically takes about three months and depends on the child's age and the severity of the condition. Following recovery, individuals with SCS look and act completely normal, so no one would even be able to tell that they have SCS.\n\nSCS is the most common craniosynostosis syndrome and affects 1 in every 25,000 to 50,000 individuals. It occurs in all racial and ethnic groups, and affects males and females equally. If a parent carries a copy of the SCS gene mutation, then there is a 50% chance their child will also carry a copy of the gene mutation, in which case, the child may or may not show signs of SCS. There is also a 50% chance their child will have two working copies of the gene, and would therefore, not have SCS. If both parents carry a single copy of the SCS gene mutation, then there is a 25% chance their child will have two gene mutation copies (so child would develop severe SCS), a 25% chance their child would have two normal copies of the gene (so would be completely normal), and a 50% chance their child would carry one gene mutation copy and 1 normal copy (so child may or may not display SCS). In rare situations, two normal parents can have a child with SCS due to a \"de novo\" mutation. The exact cause of the \"de novo\" mutation is unknown, but it doesn't seem to be related to anything that the parents did or didn't do during the pregnancy. SCS due to a \"de novo\" mutation is so rare that the proportion of past cases is unknown.\n\nIn 1931, Haakon Saethre, a Norwegian psychiatrist, described similar characteristics between a mother and her two daughters. They all had long and uneven facial features, low-set hairlines, short fingers, and webbing between the second and third fingers and between the second, third, and fourth toes. A year later in 1932, F. Chotzen, a German psychiatrist, described a father and his two sons as having very similar characteristics as the mother and her daughters, as well as having hearing loss, short stature, and mild mental retardation. Hence, the name Saethre-Chotzen Syndrome was derived from the two scientists, who had separately described the condition without any previous knowledge of the other.\n\n"}

One of the largest athletic facilities ever built, its twelve acres of interior space include a nine-story tower containing a third-floor swimming pool, fencing facilities, and a polo practice room. The building houses the facilities of many varsity teams at Yale, including basketball, fencing, gymnastics, squash, swimming, and volleyball. It is the second-largest gym in the world by cubic feet and the 94th largest in the United States by square footage.\n\nThe building was donated to Yale by John Hay Whitney, of the Yale class of 1926, in honor of his father, Payne Whitney. Because it was designed in the Gothic Revival style that prevailed at Yale between 1920 and 1945, it is commonly known as \"the cathedral of sweat\". For the design of Payne Whitney Gymnasium, architect John Russell Pope was awarded the Silver Medal at the 1932 Olympic Games Art Competition.\n\nThe stuffed original Handsome Dan, the bulldog mascot of Yale and the first college mascot in the United States, resides in a glass cabinet near the entrance to the building.\n\nThe basketball team plays in the John J. Lee Amphitheater, which was named in 1996 for John J. Lee, '56 M.Eng., a star basketball player and benefactor in restoration projects; the volleyball and gymnastics teams also compete in the Amphiteater. The wing opposite the Amphiteater houses the Robert J. H. Kiphuth Exhibition Pool (6 lanes, 25 yards), where the swimming teams compete. The pool is named for Yale's legendary swimming coach and athletic director.\n\nA series of three crew tanks runs along the back of the gym, providing training facilities for the crews. Above the crew tanks is the Practice Pool, one of the world's largest suspended natatoriums (5 lanes, 50 meters, 2 bulkheads). Above the Practice Pool are recreational basketball courts.\n\nOn the wings, the Adrian \"Ace\" Israel Fitness Center is located above the Kiphuth Exhibition Pool, and the Brady Squash Center is located above the Amphitheater. The Squash Center, one of the world's premier competition facilities, is also home to the U.S. Squash Hall of Fame. The roof of the Squash Center has a small outdoor running track.\n\nThe tower itself contains the Kiphuth Trophy Room (where mementos from Harvard-Yale game balls to Olympic gold medals are displayed), several multi-purpose recreational areas, the fencing salon, and the gymnastics studio.\n\nThe Lanman Center, located behind the Amphitheater wing, provides a vast spread of additional flexible floor space, with a balcony running track ringing the facility.\n\nThe William K. Lanman Center was added in 1999 as a new wing, with additional courts for basketball and volleyball, and an indoor running track. This was the first phase of a $100 million renovation program.\n\nIn 2006, the building is having external work done to repair flashing and stop leaks. Other work includes the purchasing of banners and benches for the Kiphuth Exhibition Pool, the resurfacing of the floor in the Lee Amphitheater, and the upgrading of the Practice Pool's filtration system (see \"Pool Closure\" below).\n\nBefore coeducation, the third floor pool was strictly \"no suits,\" i.e. nude. Freshmen at that time had to undergo questionable \"posture\" tests that involved nude photographs. They were instructed that if they had an excessive lordotic curve, remedial exercises would be prescribed, although it seemed no one ever was so required.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2223805", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2223805", "title": "National emblem of Indonesia", "text": "National emblem of Indonesia\n\nThe national emblem of Indonesia is called Garuda Pancasila. The main part of Indonesian national emblem is the Garuda with a heraldic shield on its chest and a scroll gripped by its legs. The shield's five emblems represent \"Pancasila\", the five principles of Indonesia's national ideology. The Garuda claws gripping a white ribbon scroll inscribed with the national motto \"Bhinneka Tunggal Ika\" written in black text, which can be loosely translated as \"Unity in Diversity\". \"Garuda Pancasila\" was designed by Sultan Hamid II from Pontianak, supervised by Sukarno, and was adopted as the national emblem on 11 February 1950.\n\nGaruda, the discipled carrier or vehicle (vahana) of Lord Vishnu, appears in many ancient Hindu-Buddhist temples of ancient Indonesia. Temples such as Mendut, Borobudur, Sajiwan, Prambanan, Kidal, Penataran, Belahan, and Sukuh depict the images (bas-relief or statue) of Garuda. In Prambanan temple complex there is a single temple located in front of Vishnu temple, dedicated to Garuda. However, there is no statue of Garuda inside the chamber today. In the Shiva temple, also in Prambanan complex, there is a relief telling an episode of Ramayana about Garuda's nephew who also belongs to the bird-god race, Jatayu, tried to rescue Sita from Ravana's hand. The deified statue of King Airlangga depicted as Vishnu mounting Garuda from Belahan, probably the most famous statue of Garuda from ancient Java. Now the statue is one of the important collection of Trowulan Museum.\n\nGaruda appear in many traditions and stories, especially in Java and Bali. In many stories Garuda symbolises the virtue of knowledge, power, bravery, loyalty, and discipline. As the vehicle of Vishnu, Garuda also bears the attributes of Vishnu, which symbolise preservation of cosmic order. Balinese tradition venerated Garuda as \"the lord of all flying creatures\", and \"the majestic king of birds\". In Bali, Garuda traditionally portrayed as a divine creature with head, beak, wings, and claw of an eagle, while has the body of a human. Usually portrayed in intricate carving with golden and vivid colours, as the vehicle of Vishnu or in battle scene against Nāga (dragon) serpents. The important and noble position of Garuda in Indonesian tradition since ancient times has venerated Garuda as the national symbol of Indonesia, the embodiment of Indonesian ideology, \"Pancasila\". Garuda also chosen as the name of Indonesian national airlines, Garuda Indonesia. Next to Indonesia, Thailand also uses the Garuda as its national symbol.\n\nAfter the Indonesian National Revolution ended and followed by the Dutch acknowledgement of the Indonesian independence in 1949, there is a need to create a national emblem of United States of Indonesia. On 10 January 1950 the Committee of State Seal was formed, under co-ordination of Sultan Hamid II of Pontianak as the State Minister of No Portfolio, with Muhammad Yamin as the chairman, and Ki Hajar Dewantara, M. A. Melkias Agustinus Pellaupessy, Mohammad Natsir, and Raden Mas Ngabehi Poerbatjaraka as committee members. The committee task is to select the proposals of United States of Indonesia national emblem to be presented to the government.\n\nAccording to Mohammad Hatta, in his memoire \"Bung Hatta Menjawab\", to fulfill the mandate of the Cabinet, Minister Priyono had launched the design competition. After the competition was held, there were two proposed designs selected as the finalist; one was the work of Sultan Hamid II and the other one was the work of Muhammad Yamin. In further process the design proposed by Sultan Hamid II was accepted by both People's Consultative Assembly (DPR) and the Government, while Yamin's design was rejected because featuring shining sun emblem that deemed clearly demonstrate the influence of Japanese Empire flag. Sukarno as The President of United States of Indonesia together with Mohammad Hatta as the Prime Minister, asked Sultan Hamid II to change the red and white ribbon being held by Garuda talons to white scroll bearing the national motto \"Bhinneka Tunggal Ika\". On 8 February 1950, the design created by Sultan Hamid II was presented to President Sukarno. The design featuring Garuda in its anthropomorphic form, similar to traditional depiction of Garuda in ancient Javanese, Balinese, and Siamese art. However, the Islamic party Masyumi expressed their objection and stated that the bird with human neck and shoulders with both hands holding the \"Pancasila\" shield was too mythical.\n\nSultan Hamid II edited his design and proposed the new version, this time discarding the anthropomorphic form, the eagle-like Garuda was done in stylised naturalistic style and named \"Rajawali\" (eagle) \"Garuda Pancasila\". President Sukarno presented this design to the cabinet and Prime Minister Hatta. According to AG Pringgodigdo in his book \"Sekitar Pancasila\" published by the Minister of Defence and Security, the improved design of \"Garuda Pancasila\" by Sultan Hamid II was officially adopted in United States of Indonesia Cabinet Assembly on 11 February 1950. At that time, the \"Rajawali Garuda Pancasila\" was still \"bald\" without crest crowning its head like current version. President Sukarno introduced the national emblem of Indonesia to the public at Hotel Des Indes, Jakarta, on 15 February 1950.\n\nSukarno continued to improve the design of \"Garuda Pancasila\". On 20 March 1950, Sukarno ordered the palace artist Dullah to make several improvements according to his suggestions, such as the addition of a crest and the change of talons position to the scroll. It was believed that Sukarno suggested the crest addition because the \"bald\" Garuda was considered too similar to the bald eagle in the United States Great Seal.\n\nThe Garuda clutches in its talons a scroll bearing the National Motto of Indonesia, \"\"Bhinneka Tunggal Ika\"\" which is an Old Javanese stanza of the epic poem \"Sutasoma\" attributed to the 14th-century poet sage of the Javanese Majapahit Empire, Empu Tantular. The text was redesicovered by the Dutch scholar Brandes from among the many lontar manuscripts among the Dutch booty called the \"Lombok treasure\" — looted from the destroyed Lombok palace in 1894. who is said to have committed the phrase to writing for the first time.\n\nThe poem expounded a doctrine of reconciliation between the Hindu and Buddhist faiths: meaning literally \"Although diverse, both truthful to Dharma — thus there exists no duality in Truth\". This spirit of religious tolerance was an essential element in the foundation and security of the newly emerging State of Majapahit and the thus fledgling Republic of Indonesia. It is roughly rendered, \"Diverse, yet united\" or perhaps more poetically in English: \"Unity in Diversity\". The official Indonesian language translation is: \"Berbeda-beda namun tetap satu jua\".\n\nThe National Emblem is used to symbolise Indonesian government and as official emblem of Indonesian ministries, departments and institutions. It is commonly displayed in Indonesian state palaces, monuments, government offices, buildings and also Indonesian embassies abroad. It is also used in private offices and buildings, also in the classes of public schools, placed on the wall slightly upper than the President's and Vice-President's photographs that flanked the emblem. Also, it is used on the front of every Naval vessel, denoting governmental status of the vessel. Moreover, every governor and head of cities or regencies wears the National Emblem on their headgear's badge. The President uses it on every plane he/she travelled with. Every Ministry, Provincial, Military and Police flag also uses it on one side.\n\nThe Indonesian National Emblem is used as part of governmental institutions' and organisations' emblems. Such as being included within the emblems of Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK), General Elections Commission (KPU), People's Representative Council (DPR), and Regional Representative Council (DPD).\n\nIn sports, many sport branches uses the National Emblem as their uniform insignia, such as football, creating the nickname for the Indonesia national football team as the \"Garuda Team\".\n\nHowever, some elements of Garuda Pancasila is used in some on non-national and non-governmental organisation. For example, the Great Indonesia Movement Party (Gerindra) used the head of Garuda Pancasila as the main part of their symbol. The rallying symbol of Prabowo Subianto's 2014 presidential campaign also used the \"Garuda Merah\" (red Garuda), a red silhouette of Garuda Pancasila, which raised the controversy and protest whether a partisan non-governmental organisations should be allowed on using the national emblem as rallying symbol. The controversy also raised from pro-Prabowo musician Ahmad Dhani who campaigned through a music video that displays golden Garuda Pancasila — which looks like the German imperial eagle, in aesthetic imagery reminiscent of Nazi's style fascism. The red Garuda is again used as part of Prabowo's campaign for presidency in the 2019 election.\n\nThe Garuda is the mythical golden eagle, common to both Hindu and Buddhist mythology. The Garuda was a chimera, having the wings, beak, and feet of the golden eagle, but a man's arms and trunk. The Garuda is commonly used as an emblem in South and Southeast Asian nations. The use of the Garuda in Indonesia's coat-of-arms invokes the pre-colonial Hindu kingdoms that spanned across the archipelago, from which the present-day Republic of Indonesia is understood to be descended.\n\nHowever, unlike the traditional anthropomorphic form of Garuda as featured in ancient temples in Java, the Balinese Garuda, or the national emblem of Thailand, the design of Indonesia's \"Garuda Pancasila\" is rendered in modern naturalist style. The design of \"Garuda Pancasila\" was inspired by the \"elang Jawa\" or Javan hawk-eagle (\"Nisaetus bartelsi\"), an endangered raptor endemic to the mountainous forest regions of Java. The Javan hawk-eagle's resemblance to the \"Garuda Pancasila\" is most obvious with the prominent crest crowning its head and the plumage coloured dark-brownish to chestnut-gold. By presidential decree, the Javan hawk-eagle was legally registered as the national bird of Indonesia, and thus attributing the endangered species very high protection.<ref name=\"Keppres No.4/1993\">Keputusan Presiden No. 4/1993, issued on 10 January 1993, the status of \"Elang Jawa\" (Javan hawk-eagle) as the national bird of Indonesia (Widyastuti 1993, Sözer et al. 1998).</ref>\n\nAs for the national emblem, the Garuda symbolises strength and power, while the gold colour symbolises greatness and glory.\n\nThe feathers on the Garuda of the Indonesian coat-of-arms are arranged so that they invoke the date of 17 August 1945, the officially recognised Indonesian Day of Independence. The total number of feathers symbolises the date of the proclamation of Indonesian independence: \nThese numbers of feathers correspond to \"17/8/1945\" international date format for Indonesian Independence Day.\n\nEach section of the shield has a symbol corresponding to the Pancasila principles laid down by its founder, President Sukarno. The numbers of some elements in these symbols might evokes certain numbers, such as 17 and 5 which represents the date of independence and the number of principles in Pancasila, respectively.\n\nThe escutcheon is a martial symbol, representing the defence of the country. It is divided into five sections: a background divided into quarters, coloured red and white (the colours of the national flag) in a checkerboard pattern; and a smaller, concentric shield, black in background. A thick, black line lies horizontally across the shield, symbolising the equator which passes through the Indonesian archipelago.\n\nThe black shield bearing the golden star at centre corresponds to the first \"Pancasila principle\": \"Belief in One Supreme God\" (\"Ketuhanan yang Maha Esa\"). The colour black represents the colour of nature. Upon this shield at centre is a golden, five-pointed star. This is a symbol common not only among Indonesia's sanctioned faiths of Islam, Christianity, Hinduism, Confucianism and Buddhism, but of the secular ideology of socialism as well.\n\nThis tenet of \"Pancasila\" has always been controversial, for it suggests compulsory religious belief as well as compulsory monotheism. Supporters of Sukarno's legacy, however, believe that this tenet was meant to unify Indonesia's population, who have diverse faiths and beliefs.\n\nIn the bottom right quarter, on a red background, is a chain made up of 9 round links representing women and 8 square links representing men, together they sum the number 17. This chain represents successive human generations. It corresponds to the second principle of the \"Pancasila\", the principle of \"Just and Civilised Humanity\".\n\nAt the upper right quarter, on a white background, is the banyan tree (Indonesian, \"beringin\"). This symbol corresponds to the third \"Pancasila\" principle, the principle of \"The Unity of Indonesia\". The banyan is known for having expansive above-ground roots and branches. The Republic of Indonesia, as an ideal conceived by Sukarno and the Nationalists, is one country out of many far-flung cultural roots.\n\nIn the upper left quarter, on a red background, is the head of the Javanese wild bull, the \"banteng\". This represents the fourth principle of \"Pancasila\", the principle of \"Democracy that is Guided by the Inner Wisdom in the Unanimity Arising Out of Deliberations Amongst Representatives\". The banteng was chosen to symbolise democracy as Indonesians saw it as a social animal. The banteng was also adopted as a symbol of Sukarno's Nationalists, and later by his daughter Megawati Soekarnoputri's Indonesia Democratic Party of Struggle.\n\nIn the lower left quarter, on a white background, are a gold-and-white paddy and cotton. There are 17 seeds of rice and 5 cotton buds. These represent the fifth \"Pancasila\" principle, the principle of \"Social Justice for the Entire People of Indonesia\". The rice and cotton represent sustenance and livelihood.\n\nThe \"Garuda Pancasila\" song was composed by Sudharnoto as a patriotic song to commemorate the Indonesian struggle.\n\n\"Garuda Pancasila\"\n\"Akulah pendukungmu\"\n\"Patriot proklamasi\"\n\"Sedia berkorban untukmu\"\n\n\"O, Garuda Pancasila\"\n\"I am your supporter\"\n\"A patriot of Proclamation\"\n\"I am willing to sacrifice myself for you\"\n\n\"O, Garuda Pancasila\"\n\"A soldier for you, I am\"\n\"A vanguard of Proclamation, I stand\"\n\"I place my life and fortune in your hands\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2223878", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2223878", "title": "Olympia Brewing Company", "text": "Olympia Brewing Company\n\nThe Olympia Brewing Company was a brewery in the northwest United States, located in Tumwater, Washington, near Olympia. Founded in 1896 by Leopold Friederich Schmidt, it was bought by G. Heileman Brewing Company in 1983. Through a series of consolidations, it was acquired by Pabst Brewing Company in 1999; the Tumwater brewery was closed in 2003.\n\nLeopold Schmidt, a German immigrant from Montana founded The Capital Brewing Company at Tumwater Falls on the Deschutes River in the town of Tumwater, near the south end of Puget Sound. He built a four-story wooden brewhouse, a five-story cellar building, a one-story ice factory powered by the lower falls, and a bottling and keg plant and in 1896, began brewing and selling Olympia Beer. In 1902, the firm became Olympia Brewing Company, with Frank Kenney as the Company Secretary. It was Frank Kenney who proposed the slogan \"It's the Water\" to promote the brewery's flagship product. Statewide Prohibition, which began in January 1916, four years before National Prohibition, ended beer making operations. After Prohibition ended, a new Olympia Brewery was erected just upstream from the original, and Olympia beer went back on sale in 1934.\n\nOlympia was a very popular regional brand in the Pacific Northwest for half of a century. It eventually expanded nationwide, repositioned as a low-price lager. During the 1970s, Olympia acquired Hamm's and Lone Star, and also produced Buckhorn Beer, which had previously been a product of the Lone Star Brewing Company. Until the mid-1970s, competitor Coors of Colorado had a limited 11-state distribution area; Washington and Montana were not added until 1976, and Oregon did not approve sales of Coors in grocery stores until 1985.\n\nBetween 1970 and 1980 Olympia faced flat revenues among consolidating nationwide breweries and, in 1982, the Schmidt family, which owned and operated the brewery and company, elected to sell the company. Olympia was subsequently purchased by G. Heileman Brewing Company in 1983, which was purchased by Stroh Brewery Company in 1996. In 1999, Pabst bought most of the Stroh brands, including Olympia.\n\nAs with many other regional breweries, ownership of Olympia eventually passed through several corporations including Pabst, Heileman, and Stroh's, until the brewery was eventually purchased by Miller Brewing Company. For a time, the Olympia brewery took over the brewing of other Pacific Northwest brands as their original breweries were closed one by one, including the Lucky Lager brewery in Vancouver, Washington, the Henry Weinhard's brewery in Portland, and even the brewery of its arch-rival, Rainier Beer, in Seattle. In 2002, SAB bought out Miller Brewing Co. SABMiller closed the Tumwater facility in mid-2003, citing the unprofitability of such a small brewery.\n\nPabst was purchased, along with the Olympia label, by beer industry veteran Eugene Kashper with backing from TSG Consumer Partners in 2014, and Olympia Beer continues to be contract brewed by MillerCoors at their brewery in Irwindale, California.\n\nAg Energy Resources of Benton, Illinois purchased the machinery from Olympia Brewing to make ethanol for motor fuel use.\n\nPart of the brewery complex was heavily damaged in a fire on October 7, 2018. The administration building's south side partially collapsed, and a 3-alarm fire call caused fire units to respond from many neighboring departments.\n\nFor many years, Olympia Beer was brewed with water obtained from artesian wells. The company's promotions made much of the use of artesian water in the brewing process. However, the advertisements never explained what artesian water was, preferring to claim that the water was controlled by a mythical population of \"artesians\". Once the brewery was taken over by a larger company, the use of artesian water was discontinued, and so was that advertising campaign.\n\nIn downtown Olympia, current efforts to preserve the use of artesian water at one of the remaining public wells has been the mission of H2Olympia: Artesian Well Advocates.\n\nDaredevil Evel Knievel was sponsored by Olympia Beer. Olympia paid a hefty price tag to have Evel sew patches onto his jackets, signs on his vehicles, even stitching \"Olympia Beer\" onto parachutes attached to his dragster. This was an attempt to take Olympia nationwide.\nDustin Hoffman's Benjamin Braddock drinks an Olympia beer in \"The Graduate\" (1967). Paul Newman drinks Olympia in the movie, \"Sometimes a Great Notion\" (1970). Nearly the entire cast, including Marvin Gaye drinks Olympia bottles, stubbies, cans and tall boys, in \"Chrome and Hot Leather\" (1971). A neon sign advertising Olympia beer can be seen in the window of the liquor store in \"American Graffiti\" (1973). Clint Eastwood promoted the brand in several popular films, including \"Magnum Force\" (1973), \"Thunderbolt and Lightfoot\" (1974), \"The Eiger Sanction\" (1975), \"Every Which Way but Loose\" (1978) (in which his orangutan Clyde also indulges), and \"Any Which Way You Can\" (1980).

The Blues Brothers Band drinks $300 worth of Olympia in 'Bob's Country Bunker' tavern in \"The Blues Brothers\" (1980) John Denver drinks an Olympia in \"\"Oh, God!\"\" (1977). Signage and cans being consumed are also easily visible in \"The China Syndrome\" (1979). The brand was also featured in the movie \"Friday the 13th Part III\" (1982) and \"Airport 1975\" (1974). A neon light Olympia Beer sign can be seen in the roadhouse bar in the vampire cult-classic \"Near Dark\" (1987) and in the Matt Damon film \"Promised Land\" (2012). In the independent B-movie \"\" (2005), the teen-age campers and the adult hunters were drinking the brand. Josh Brolin's George W. Bush drinks a barely recognizable bottle of Olympia beer in \"W.\" (2008). Bill Hader's character drinks several cans of Olympia Beer in \"The To Do List\" (2013). Many of the characters in \"The Hollywood Knights\" drink Olympia beer in stubby bottles. It can also be seen in the 1983 American horror/thriller film \"Cujo\".\n\nThe second word in American rock band Creedence Clearwater Revival's name is derived from an Olympia advertising campaign.\n\nThe movie \"House of Games\" includes a set with cases of Olympia Beer stacked toward the back of the room.\n\nIn a Mickey Rooney movie from the Andy Hardy series, the title character has to change a tire on his dad's car. On the street in front of their house, Mickey and his dad remove a case of Olympia Beer from the trunk to get at the spare tire jack.\n\nOlympia Beer was praised as one of the top 25 beers in the world in a 2012 MensJournal.com review article.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2223897", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2223897", "title": "Kālua", "text": "Kālua\n\nKālua is a traditional Hawaiian cooking method that utilizes an \"imu\", a type of underground oven. The word \"\"kālua\"\" (\"to cook in an underground oven\" in the Hawaiian language) may also be used to describe the food cooked in this manner, such as kālua pig or kālua turkey, which are commonly served at lūʻau feasts. The word \"lūʻau\" is the Hawaiian name for the taro leaf, which, when young and small resembles cooked spinach after being steamed for a few hours . The traditional lūʻau was eaten on the floor over \"lauhala\" mats (leaves of the hala tree woven together).\n\nTraditionally, a hardwood fire is built inside a pit large enough to contain the food to be cooked, the stones, and the vegetation used to cover the food. Stones are placed on top of the fire in the pit, taking around two to three hours to reach their maximum temperature. Most important is the selection of stones that contain very little moisture to avoid stones exploding from the steam generated by the heat. Once the stones have become extremely hot, they are spread out over the coals and the pit is lined with vegetation, such as banana trees, that have been pounded to make them pliable. A layer of \"ti\" leaves (\"Cordyline fruticosa\") would then be spread over the layer of pounded vegetation and the food to be cooked placed on top. Meat to be cooked would be salted and in the instance of cooking a whole pig, some hot stones would also be placed inside the body cavity to ensure the meat is fully cooked. \n\nTo maintain even heating and to retain the meat's natural moisture, the meat is covered with more layers of vegetation such as \"ti\" and banana leaves, then covered with a layer of soil at least several inches deep ensuring that no steam escapes. The layers of vegetation covering the food must extend past the edges of the pit to ensure the food is not contaminated by the soil it is buried under. The meat is then left to cook in the pit for several hours. When the meat is fully cooked, it is removed from the \"imu\" and shredded. Modern adaptations to the traditional cooking method include the use of wet burlap material as a substitute for the vegetation or to reduce the amount of vegetation needed, and also the use of non-galvanized steel chicken wire or mesh wrapped around the food to aid in its removal when cooked. The characteristic flavor of kālua pig is imparted by the smoke from the hardwood but more importantly the use of ti leaves to wrap the meat. The flavor of the ti leaf is what differentiates kālua pig from other methods of cooking a whole hog slowly using a hardwood fire.\n\nKālua pig is a main tourist attraction at many lūʻau, though it is sometimes made using a gas or electric stove with artificial mesquite or kiawe liquid smoke. Other tourist businesses use substitutes instead of vegetation or use an \"imu pao\", an above ground variation of the \"imu\". The term \"kālua pork\" has been used by Hawaiian cook Sam Choy to describe pork shoulder butt which is rubbed with sea salt, wrapped in ti leaves, and slowly cooked in an oven using liquid mesquite smoke rather than an \"imu\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2223903", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2223903", "title": "Dermatophytosis", "text": "Dermatophytosis\n\nDermatophytosis, also known as ringworm, is a fungal infection of the skin. Typically it results in a red, itchy, scaly, circular rash. Hair loss may occur in the area affected. Symptoms begin four to fourteen days after exposure. Multiple areas can be affected at a given time.\nAbout 40 types of fungi can cause ringworm. They are typically of the \"Trichophyton\", \"Microsporum\", or \"Epidermophyton\" type. Risk factors include using public showers, contact sports such as wrestling, excessive sweating, contact with animals, obesity, and poor immune function. Ringworm can spread from other animals or between people. Diagnosis is often based on the appearance and symptoms. It may be confirmed by either culturing or looking at a skin scraping under a microscope.\nPrevention is by keeping the skin dry, not walking barefoot in public, and not sharing personal items. Treatment is typically with antifungal creams such as clotrimazole or miconazole. If the scalp is involved, antifungals by mouth such as fluconazole may be needed.\nGlobally, up to 20% of the population may be infected by ringworm at any given time. Infections of the groin are more common in males, while infections of the scalp and body occur equally in both sexes. Infections of the scalp are most common in children while infections of the groin are most common in the elderly. Descriptions of ringworm date back to ancient history.\nInfections on the body may give rise to typical enlarging raised red rings of ringworm. Infection on the skin of the feet may cause athlete's foot and in the groin, jock itch. Involvement of the nails is termed onychomycosis, and they may thicken, discolour, and finally crumble and fall off. They are common in most adult people, with up to 20% of the population having one of these infections at any given moment.\n\nAnimals such as dogs and cats can also be affected by ringworm, and the disease can be transmitted between animals and humans, making it a zoonotic disease.\n\nSpecific signs can be:\n\nFungi thrive in moist, warm areas, such as locker rooms, tanning beds, swimming pools, and skin folds; accordingly, those that cause dermatophytosis may be spread by using exercise machines that have not been disinfected after use, or by sharing towels, clothing, footwear, or hairbrushes.\n\nA number of different species of fungi are involved in dermatophytosis. Dermatophytes of the genera \"Trichophyton\" and \"Microsporum\" are the most common causative agents. These fungi attack various parts of the body and lead to the conditions listed below. The Latin names are for the conditions (disease patterns), not the agents that cause them. The disease patterns below identify the type of fungus that causes them only in the cases listed:\n\n\n\nAdvice often given includes:\n\n no approved human vaccine exist against \"Dermatophytosis\". For horses, dogs and cats there is available an approved inactivated vaccine called \"Insol Dermatophyton\" (Boehringer Ingelheim) which provides time-limited protection against several trichophyton and microsporum fungal strains. With cattle, systemic vaccination has achieved effective control of ringworm. Since 1979 a Russian live vaccine (LFT 130) and later on a Czechoslovakian live vaccine against bovine ringworm has been used. In Scandinavian countries vaccination programmes against ringworm are used as a preventive measure to improve the hide quality. In Russia, fur-bearing animals (silver fox, foxes, polar foxes) and rabbits have also been treated with vaccines.\n\nAntifungal treatments include topical agents such as miconazole, terbinafine, clotrimazole, ketoconazole, or tolnaftate applied twice daily until symptoms resolve — usually within one or two weeks. Topical treatments should then be continued for a further 7 days after resolution of visible symptoms to prevent recurrence. The total duration of treatment is therefore generally two weeks, but may be as long as three.\n\nIn more severe cases or scalp ringworm, systemic treatment with oral medications may be given.\n\nTo prevent spreading the infection, lesions should not be touched, and good hygiene maintained with washing of hands and the body.\n\nMisdiagnosis and treatment of ringworm with a topical steroid, a standard treatment of the superficially similar pityriasis rosea, can result in tinea incognito, a condition where ringworm fungus grows without typical features, such as a distinctive raised border.\n\nDermatophytosis has been prevalent since before 1906, at which time ringworm was treated with compounds of mercury or sometimes sulfur or iodine. Hairy areas of skin were considered too difficult to treat, so the scalp was treated with X-rays and followed up with antifungal medication. Another treatment from around the same time was application of Araroba powder.\n\nThe most common term for the infection, \"ringworm\", is a misnomer, since the condition is caused by fungi of several different species and not by parasitic worms.\n\nRingworm caused by \"Trichophyton verrucosum\" is a frequent clinical condition in cattle. Young animals are more frequently affected. The lesions are located on the head, neck, tail, and perineum. The typical lesion is a round, whitish crust. Multiple lesions may coalesce in \"map-like\" appearance.\n\nClinical dermatophytosis is also diagnosed in sheep, dogs, cats, and horses. Causative agents, besides \"Trichophyton verrucosum, are\" \"T. mentagrophytes\", \"T. equinum\", \"Microsporum gypseum\", \"M. canis\", and \"M. nanum\".\n\nDermatophytosis may also be present in the holotype of the Cretaceous eutriconodont mammal \"Spinolestes\", suggesting a Mesozoic origin for this disease.\n\nRingworm in pets may often be asymptomatic, resulting in a carrier condition which infects other pets. In some cases, the disease only appears when the animal develops an immunodeficiency condition. Circular bare patches on the skin suggest the diagnosis, but no lesion is truly specific to the fungus. Similar patches may result from allergies, sarcoptic mange, and other conditions. Three species of fungi cause 95% of dermatophytosis in pets: these are \"Microsporum canis\", \"Microsporum gypseum\", and \"Trichophyton mentagrophytes\".\n\nVeterinarians have several tests to identify ringworm infection and identify the fungal species that cause it:\n\nWoods test: This is an ultraviolet light with a magnifying lens. Only 50% of \"M. canis\" will show up as an apple-green fluorescence on hair shafts, under the UV light. The other fungi do not show. The fluorescent material is not the fungus itself (which does not fluoresce), but rather an excretory product of the fungus which sticks to hairs. Infected skin does not fluoresce.\n\nMicroscopic test: The veterinarian takes hairs from around the infected area and places them in a staining solution to view under the microscope. Fungal spores may be viewed directly on hair shafts. This technique identifies a fungal infection in about 40%–70% of the infections, but cannot identify the species of dermatophyte.\n\nCulture test: This is the most effective, but also the most time-consuming, way to determine if ringworm is on a pet. In this test, the veterinarian collects hairs from the pet, or else collects fungal spores from the pet's hair with a toothbrush, or other instrument, and inoculates fungal media for culture. These cultures can be brushed with transparent tape and then read by the veterinarian using a microscope, or can be sent to a pathological lab. The three common types of fungi which commonly cause pet ringworm can be identified by their characteristic spores. These are different-appearing macroconidia in the two common species of \"Microspora\", and typical microconidia in \"Trichophyton\" infections.\n\nIdentifying the species of fungi involved in pet infections can be helpful in controlling the source of infection. \"M. canis\", despite its name, occurs more commonly in domestic cats, and 98% of cat infections are with this organism. It can also infect dogs and humans, however. \"T. mentagrophytes\" has a major reservoir in rodents, but can also infect pet rabbits, dogs, and horses. \"M. gypseum\" is a soil organism and is often contracted from gardens and other such places. Besides humans, it may infect rodents, dogs, cats, horses, cattle, and swine.\n\nTreatment requires both systemic oral treatment with most of the same drugs used in humans—terbinafine, fluconazole, or itraconazole—as well as a topical \"dip\" therapy.\n\nBecause of the usually longer hair shafts in pets compared to those of humans, the area of infection and possibly all of the longer hair of the pet must be clipped to decrease the load of fungal spores clinging to the pet's hair shafts. However, close shaving is usually not done because nicking the skin facilitates further skin infection.\n\nTwice-weekly bathing of the pet with diluted lime sulfur dip solution is effective in eradicating fungal spores. This must continue for 3 to 8 weeks.\n\nWashing of household hard surfaces with 1:10 household sodium hypochlorite bleach solution is effective in killing spores, but it is too irritating to be used directly on hair and skin.\n\nPet hair must be rigorously removed from all household surfaces, and then the vacuum cleaner bag, and perhaps even the vacuum cleaner itself, discarded when this has been done repeatedly. Removal of all hair is important, since spores may survive 12 months or even as long as two years on hair clinging to surfaces.\n\nIn bovines, an infestation is difficult to cure, as systemic treatment is uneconomical. Local treatment with iodine compounds is time-consuming, as it needs scraping of crusty lesions. Moreover, it must be carefully conducted using gloves, lest the worker become infested.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2223910", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2223910", "title": "Prairie Oyster", "text": "Prairie Oyster\n\nPrairie Oyster was a Canadian country music group from Toronto, Ontario. They were named Country Group or Duo of the year six times by both the Canadian Country Music Association (CCMA) and the Juno Awards. The band also won the Bud Country Fans' Choice Award from the CCMA in 1994. They have four No. 1 country singles in Canada, with an additional 12 singles reaching the Canadian Country Top 10. Eight of their albums have been certified gold or platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association, including the 1992 CCMA Album of the Year \"Everybody Knows\".\n\nWhile no formal announcement seems to have been made, the band is no longer touring nor are they maintaining their web site. Front-man Russell deCarle has been touring solo to promote a new CD. Guitarist Keith Glass released his own solo CD in 2013 and has been touring on his own as well as backing up other artists, such as Lynn Miles.\n\nPrairie Oyster formed in 1974 in Toronto. As a trio, consisting of singer/bassist Russell deCarle (born May 31, 1954), guitarist Keith Glass (born 1952) and steel guitarist Dennis Delorme, they toured and performed on television, but did not record. They subsequently broke up in 1978.\n\nIn 1982, the band reunited, adding fiddler John P. Allen, keyboardist Joan Besen and drummer John Adames to the lineup. Bruce Moffat soon replaced Adames, and the group released its debut album, \"Oyster Tracks\", in 1986 on Stony Plain Records. The album found its way to RCA Records executive Joe Galante, who signed the group after seeing them perform. RCA wanted the band to change their name, but they were already too well known. Prairie Oyster was named Country Group or Duo of the Year at the Juno Awards in 1986 and 1987.\n\nTheir first album for RCA, \"Different Kind of Fire\", was released in 1990 in both Canada and the United States. On the success of the album, Prairie Oyster was named the CCMA Group or Duo of the Year in 1990 and 1991. They also won the Juno Award for Country Group or Duo of the Year in 1991. All four singles released reached the top 15 in Canada, including the top 5s \"Goodbye, So Long, Hello,\" \"I Don't Hurt Anymore\" and \"Something to Remember You By.\" The band didn't do as well in the United States however, with the highest charting single peaking at No. 62. \"Goodbye, So Long, Hello\" was the CCMA Single of the Year in 1990. The following year, \"Lonely You, Lonely Me\" was named Song of the Year by the CCMA. In March 1991, the band received a nomination from the Academy of Country Music for Top New Group or Duo.\n\nPrairie Oyster's third album, \"Everybody Knows\", was released in 1991. The album featured four top 10 singles in Canada: \"Did You Fall In Love with Me,\" \"One Precious Love,\" \"Will I Do (Till the Real Thing Comes Along)\" and \"Everybody Knows.\" Unfortunately, only one single charted in the U.S., \"One Precious Love\" (#51). Prairie Oyster won several CCMA Awards in 1992, including Album of the Year for \"Everybody Knows\", Song of the Year for \"Did You Fall In Love with Me,\" as well as their third straight win as Group or Duo of the Year. The Juno Awards also awarded them Country Group or Duo of the Year for the fourth time.\n\nThe band's fourth album, \"Only One Moon\", was released in Canada on Arista Records in 1994. It would also go on to become their most successful. The first single, \"Such a Lonely One,\" was also their first No. 1 in Canada. Two more singles released from the project also reached the top of the Canadian Country chart, \"Don't Cry Little Angel\" and the title track. Additional singles \"Louisiette,\" \"Black-Eyed Susan\" and \"Ancient History\" all reached the top 10. They were named Group or Duo of the Year by the CCMA in 1994, 1995 and 1996, and won the Bud Country Fans' Choice Award in 1994. The Juno Awards also recognized Prairie Oyster as the Country Group or Duo of the Year in both 1995 and 1996.\n\nTheir fifth album, \"Blue Plate Special\", was released in 1996. The first song released from the disc, \"Unbelievable Love,\" reached No. 1. \"One Way Track\" was also a top 5, but follow-up singles peaked outside the top 10. Bohdan Hluszko replaced Bruce Moffat as the drummer on the album. The following year, Hluszko was fired from the band after coming out as transgender.\n\nWith the 1998 release of their sixth album, \"What Is This Country?\", the group returned to the top 10 with the songs \"Canadian Sunrise\" (#5) and \"Keep On Dreaming (#9). Charlie Cooley filled in as drummer for the band. Cooley is the father of Canadian actor Ryan Cooley.\n\nThe band released their first greatest hits album, \"\", in 2000. The only song released from the project was \"Man in the Moon,\" which had been re-recorded as a duet with folk singer-songwriter Jenny Whiteley.\n\nPrairie Oyster re-surfaced in 2006 with the release of their latest album, \"One Kiss\", on Open Road Recordings. So far the album has produced three singles, \"Sweet Sweet Girl to Me\" (written and originally recorded by Don Gibson), \"Too Bad For Me,\" and a cover of Bob Dylan's \"I Threw It All Away.\" The group continues to tour and perform at music festivals and clubs in Canada and the United States.\n\nPrairie Oyster was inducted into the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame in 2008.\n\nIn 2011 the band was presented with a SOCAN National Achievement Award.\n\nThe band is a member of the Canadian charity Artists Against Racism.\n\nRussell deCarle currently tours and records with his solo group The Russell deCarle Trio, which play an eclectic mix of blues, jazz, country & western, Latin music, R&B and western swing. The current configuration of deCarle's band features him playing rhythm guitar instead of bass. In 2012, deCarle released his first studio album, \"Under the Big Big Sky.\" The studio album was released by Universal Music. In 2015, one of deCarle's concerts was professionally recorded and later released as \"Live At Loud Mouse Studios.\" Music critics have compared deCarle's solo recordings to other eclectic Country music and roots rock acts such as Chris Isaak, Willie Nelson, The Mavericks, Lyle Lovett, Raul Malo and Los Lobos.\n\nKeith Glass currently performs with Canadian folk artist Lynn Miles and also with his group Keith Glass & the Bad Dogs. In addition to working as a songwriter and producer, Glass is a music historian who wrote the liner notes for The Box Tops CD box set release entitled \"The Original Albums 1967-69,\" which was released in January 2015 by Raven Records.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2223911", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2223911", "title": "I-Cybie", "text": "I-Cybie\n\ni-Cybie has 16 built-in motors which allow 16 degrees of freedom. There are three CPU’s—the main Toshiba TMP91C815F for motion control and for mood calculation, a SunPlus Technology CPU used for audio playback, and an RSC 364 used for voice recognition and recording. i-Cybie is constructed using 1400 parts, and more than 90 feet of wire. The robot uses a suite of sensors to determine mood and behavior.\n\ni-Cybies can be programmed to respond to the voice commands of a specific user. Voice control is a form of speech recognition that is \"speaker dependent\". The RSC 300/364 microcontroller can process commands in any spoken language and features biometric authentication. There are 8 voice commands listed in the manual allowing the user to initiate 8 different behavior categories. In addition to voice, i-Cybies can hear sharp sounds and localize the general direction of the source. It can also count the number of hand claps given in clap command mode (play mode) and respond with the same number of barks. i-Cybie can also detected when it has fallen over and automatically stand back up. It has the ability to detect when it is in a confined space or if it has become snagged against an obstacle. i-Cybie can \"see\" movement when in guard mode (motion detection) using a light sensor in its nose and it can also detect ambient light levels and movement using a light sensor in its back. i-Cybie uses several gaits for walking and among its numerous actions it can sit, roll on its side, and stand on its head. Other features include edge detection (a special mode) and collision avoidance. i-Cybie can detect its battery charge and will shut down when battery power is low or if equipped with a Walk Up Charger and programmable cartridge it will automatically seek out its charger and recharge itself.\n\ni-Cybie uses five states or \"moods\" to determine autonomous behavior: happy, sad, sleepy, sick, and hyper. Moods are calculated based upon the cumulative count of interactions derived from the sensors. Users can tell the current mood/state by eye color, posture and type of behavior (i.e. yawning when sleepy or peeing when sick). I-Cybie is advertised as developing or evolving according to the environment and user treatment.\n\ni-Cybie accepts signals from an infrared remote control unit (RCU) and was designed to “communicate” with Silverlit's robo-chi toys by transmitting and receiving IR signals using its chest array. There are several modes that are specific to the remote including play, stay, and guard mode. The remote is also used for \"training\" the robotic toy's voice recognition feature and for setting the pause mode.\n\nI-Cybies were originally sold with a \"dummy\" cartridge inserted in a programming port on the robot's right side. A fully programmable cartridge was included with the Silverlit Downloader and Walk Up Charger accessories which were sold separately (they were later bundled with the robot). The cartridge adds specific actions for navigation to the Walk Up Charger and a special charger approach routine. It can also be programmed with the Silverlit Downloader accessory to expand the robot's autonomous behavior with actions that are not part of i-Cybie's standard suite. With a programmable cartridge inserted i-Cybie can sense its battery charge and if it is low, the robot will autonomously locate its charger and dock. After charging the i-Cybie will back away from the charger and resume autonomous operation. Tiger Electronics programmable cartridges were populated with two 1 Mbit SST39vf010 chips with a total capacity of 256KB of flash ROM. The cartridge stores extra motion data and can be used to store additional audio files. (Late cartridges are populated with a single 2 Mbit SST39vf200 chip which will not program successfully in a standard Super iCybie). Late single chip carts can now be programmed by an updated SIC. A new CROMINST is available in the downloads of www.icybie.net16.net, which can be used to create a SIC which can program single chip carts, but the SIC MUST be an older style, dual-chip dog, as making a SIC from a single chip dog is as yet untested. In addition, a new walkup cart firmware was identified, indicating the newer single chip dogs may have a different firmware to the older i-cybie.\n\nAlthough i-Cybies were designed to be programmed to individual tastes, Silverlit and Hasbro (Tiger Electronics' parent company) provided little support for development of this feature beyond the release of the Downloader and associated Downloader software. Faced with this deficit, users developed their own tools for modifying the robot's behavior. A group of dedicated modders and hackers provided unofficial support for i-Cybie during its early years on the market. The result was that a number of software and hardware tools were created to allow users to manipulate i-Cybie's behavior.\n\nYICT (Yanni Idolizes iCybie Tweeking) is a program based on the reverse-engineering efforts of a robot enthusiast known as \"Aibopet\" and is one of the user-developed tools designed to program a cartridge using either a Silverlit Downloader or a Super-i-Cybie. An exploration of the functions allowed in YICT has revealed details about i-Cybie's programming logic and action categories that are not part of the general documentation. YICT also allows users to add more actions to each mood and change the overall behavior. The YICT version 2.02 software contains a number of personalities for users to build upon (example: the Z/2 personality) and is a major source for early user group developed personalities.\n\nIt is possible to hack Tiger/Silverlit model i-Cybies and make them capable of writing directly to a programmable cartridge without the use of the downloader. This modified i-Cybie is called a \"Super\" i-Cybie (SIC) by its creator Aibopet. In general, the hack involves soldering a communications port to traces near the main CPU and installing a boot loader (CROMINST) that has been pre-loaded on a programmable cartridge. The one time process makes it possible for the robot to be programmed with a new personality and to serve as a programmer (downloader) for other i-Cybies. Users have noted that the Outrageous International i-Cybie cannot be hacked in this manner. A Super i-Cybie can also be completely reprogrammed in C language \"from the ground up\" with a user developed software development kit (ICSDK) to create new firmware.\n\nThe i-Cybie firmware was designed by Micom tech HK on behalf of Tiger. Research by i-Cybie Fans has determined that Hasbro owns the firmware rights, having acquired Tiger. There appear to be three models of i-Cybie; 88011 (Tiger/Silverlit), 88012 (Silverlit) and 88013 (Outrageous/Silverlit). Each model displays minor differences in component arrangement and structural detail and there are several circuit board versions for each model. It is not generally known whether there is a noticeable difference in firmware between models based on these differences.\n\nThe Hong Kong based Toy Company Silverlit built the prototype i-Cybie and presented it at the 1999 American International Toy Fair in New York City. The early prototypes looked very similar to Sony’s ERS-110 in appearance but were meant to compete at a significantly lower consumer price. Tiger Electronics acquired the rights to distribute i-Cybie in 2000 and spent more than 2 million dollars to further develop the robot. Tiger subsequently redesigned the prototype i-Cybie to make it look more like a dog and less like the AIBO ERS 110. A team of programmers led by Andy Filo reprogrammed i-Cybie to walk, interact, and to exhibit lifelike characteristics. The electronic pet was first released in January 2001.\n\nOriginally i-Cybies were sold with a plug-in charger, a remote, a rechargeable 12 volt nickel metal cadmium battery and a “dummy” cartridge. In 2002 the Walk Up Charger and the Downloader, each sold with a programmable cartridge, were released as accessories. The robotic toy was offered in two colors; metallic blue and metallic gold. In 2002 new shell options were offered including black, white, and transparent. The price point for i-Cybie was set at US$200, significantly less than the price for its chief robotic competitor at the time, the Sony AIBO ERS 111, then priced at more than US$1500. The i-Cybie robotic pet was set to be on the shelves in December 2000 in time for the seasonal increase in consumer spending. However, difficulties in development caused Tiger Electronics to postpone the initial release to early 2001. Soon after its debut consumers reported that an \"error\" in the original quick start manual instructed owners to charge the batteries ten hours. The time was not consistent with the recommended charge time for the charger (300ma) and the battery (800mah) released with the robot. The reported error allegedly resulted in some batteries being overcharged by users and rendered useless. Negative customer reviews may have effected some sales. Silverlit appears to have addressed this issue with the release of a \"smart\" battery charger accessory by 2002 and a higher capacity nickel metal hydride battery. Tiger Electronics discontinued support for i-Cybie soon after its release due to poor sales. Silverlit continued to support the robot and released new shell options, a Walk-Up Charger and Downloader as promised upgrades.\n\nOutrageous International Hong Kong relaunched i-Cybie in 2005 with the promise of improved features and a rumor circulated among i-Cybie fan sites of a new furry \"x-Cybie\" shell option for 2006. Although some Outrageous i-Cybies were made, only a few were released with fur (flock) covering. In 2006 the product was listed as discontinued in Western markets but some Chinese websites still list new i-Cybie's available for sale in China. As of Spring 2014, Silverlit still offered support for the robot and carried the Walk Up Charger, Downloader and other accessories for i-Cybie at their international 3deshop website.\n\nThroughout its production run i-Cybies were compared to Sony's Aibo entertainment robots. Although both devices share many features, in general AIBOs are more mechanically complex and they have a more powerful and versatile CPU. The AIBO series also use a vision system that is capable of tracking color and they possess a comparatively large suite of behavior that takes advantage of their vision abilities. Beyond its infrared collision avoidance, the i-Cybie does not have a vision system and its behavioral suite is comparatively limited. However, the i-Cybie pioneered features found in later robotic pets such as speech recognition and autonomous recharging.\n\nSoon after i-Cybie's release a small user group community developed with the intent of enhancing i-Cybie's features. Although some success was made in creating tools to manipulate the toy robot's software, lack of official support and development led the community to eventually disband.\n\nBecause of the low cost versus technological capabilities, i-Cybies have been used by universities to teach programming and robotics. Notable examples include the work of France Cadet, an artist and Associate Professor & Chair (Art & Technology department) at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Known for her robotic and bio-oriented multi-media installations, Cadet has featured i-Cybies in many of her art exhibits worldwide. Natalie Jeremijenko's Feral Dogs Project teaches students ecology at the University of California San Diego using i-Cybies modified with pollution sensors to seek out chemicals. Recently (prior to 2010) inventor Andy Filo was interviewed and commented \"[i-Cybie] is still probably one of the most complex toys that was ever sold on the toy isle\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2223940", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2223940", "title": "Strong cryptography", "text": "Strong cryptography\n\nStrong cryptography or cryptographic-ally strong are general terms applied to cryptographic systems or components that are considered highly resistant to cryptanalysis.\n\nDemonstrating the resistance of any cryptographic scheme to attack is a complex matter, requiring extensive testing and reviews, preferably in a public forum. Good algorithms and protocols are required, and good system design and implementation is needed as well. For instance, the operating system on which the cryptographic software runs should be as carefully secured as possible. Users may handle passwords insecurely, or trust 'service' personnel overly much, or simply misuse the software. (See social engineering.) \"Strong\" thus is an imprecise term and may not apply in particular situations.\nThe use of computers changed the process of cryptanalysis, famously with Bletchley Park's Colossus. But just as the development of digital computers and electronics helped in cryptanalysis, it also made possible much more complex ciphers. It is typically the case that use of a quality cipher is very efficient, while breaking it requires an effort many orders of magnitude larger - making cryptanalysis so inefficient and impractical as to be effectively impossible. \n\nSince the publication of Data Encryption Standard, the Diffie-Hellman and RSA algorithm in the 1970s, cryptography has had deep connections with abstract mathematics and become a widely used tool in communications, computer networks, and computer security generally.\n\nThis term \"cryptographically strong\" is often used to describe an encryption algorithm, and implies, in comparison to some other algorithm (which is thus cryptographically weak), greater resistance to attack. But it can also be used to describe hashing and unique identifier and filename creation algorithms. See for example the description of the Microsoft .NET runtime library function Path.GetRandomFileName. In this usage, the term means \"difficult to guess\".\n\nAn encryption algorithm is intended to be unbreakable (in which case it is as strong as it can ever be), but might be breakable (in which case it is as weak as it can ever be) so there is not, in principle, a continuum of strength as the idiom would seem to imply: Algorithm A is stronger than Algorithm B which is stronger than Algorithm C, and so on. The situation is made more complex, and less subsumable into a single strength metric, by the fact that there are many types of cryptanalytic attack and that any given algorithm is likely to force the attacker to do more work to break it when using one attack than another. \n\nThere is only one known unbreakable cryptographic system, the one-time pad, which is not generally possible to use because of the difficulties involved in exchanging one-time pads without their being compromised. So any encryption algorithm can be compared to the perfect algorithm, the one-time pad.\n\nThe usual sense in which this term is (loosely) used, is in reference to a particular attack, brute force key search — especially in explanations for newcomers to the field. Indeed, with this attack (always assuming keys to have been randomly chosen), there is a continuum of resistance depending on the length of the key used. But even so there are two major problems: many algorithms allow use of different length keys at different times, and any algorithm can forgo use of the full key length possible. Thus, Blowfish and RC5 are block cipher algorithms whose design specifically allowed for several key lengths, and who cannot therefore be said to have any particular strength with respect to brute force key search. Furthermore, US export regulations restrict key length for exportable cryptographic products and in several cases in the 1980s and 1990s (e.g., famously in the case of Lotus Notes' export approval) only partial keys were used, decreasing 'strength' against brute force attack for those (export) versions. More or less the same thing happened outside the US as well, as for example in the case of more than one of the cryptographic algorithms in the GSM cellular telephone standard. \n\nThe term is commonly used to convey that some algorithm is suitable for some task in cryptography or information security, but also resists cryptanalysis and has no, or fewer, security weaknesses. Tasks are varied, and might include:\n\n\n\"Cryptographically strong\" would seem to mean that the described method has some kind of maturity, perhaps even approved for use against different kinds of systematic attacks in theory and/or practice. Indeed, that the method may resist those attacks long enough to protect the information carried (and what stands behind the information) for a useful length of time. But due to the complexity and subtlety of the field, neither is almost ever the case. Since such assurances are not actually available in real practice, sleight of hand in language which implies that they are will generally be misleading. \n\nThere will always be uncertainty as advances (e.g., in cryptanalytic theory or merely affordable computer capacity) may reduce the effort needed to successfully use some attack method against an algorithm. \n\nIn addition, actual use of cryptographic algorithms requires their encapsulation in a cryptosystem, and doing so often introduces vulnerabilities which are not due to faults in an algorithm. For example, essentially all algorithms require random choice of keys, and any cryptosystem which does not provide such keys will be subject to attack regardless of any attack resistant qualities of the encryption algorithm(s) used.\n\nSince use of strong cryptography makes the job of intelligence agencies more difficult, many countries have enacted law or regulation restricting or simply banning the non-official use of strong cryptography. For instance, the United States has defined cryptographic products as munitions since World War II and has prohibited export of cryptography beyond a certain 'strength' (measured in part by key size), and Russia banned its use by private individuals in 1995. It is not clear if the Russian ban is still in effect. France had quite strict regulations in this field, but has relaxed them in recent years.\n\nOpenPGP therefor uses SHA2 integrity and AES cryptography.\n\nExamples that are not considered cryptographically strong include:\nThe latest version of TLS protocol (version 1.3), used to secure Internet transactions, is generally considered strong. Several vulnerabilities exist in previous versions, including demonstrated attacks such as POODLE. Worse, some cipher-suites are deliberately weakened to use a 40-bit effective key to allow export under pre-1996 U.S. regulations.\n\n\n"}

Her mother, who raised her alone, was a Scottish-Irish legal secretary. Her father was a Somali-born dock worker, although Poly Styrene used to tell the press that he was a dispossessed Somali aristocrat.\n\nAs a teenager, Styrene was a hippie. At age 15, she ran away from home with £3 in her pocket, and hitchhiked from one music festival to another, staying at hippie crash pads. Thinking of this as a challenge to survive, her adventure ended when she stepped on a rusty nail while bathing in a stream and had to be treated for septicaemia.\n\nHaving been, 'an itinerant traveller, alternative fashion designer and a failed pop-reggae singer', after seeing the Sex Pistols performance at the Pier Pavilion Hastings on the south coast of England on 3 July 1976 (her 19th birthday) she decided to form the punk band X-Ray Spex.\n\nStyrene recorded her first demo album in 1975, when she was 18 years old. Her manager enlisted Ted Bunting to produce the record.\n\nIn 1976, Styrene released her first single under her real name, Mari Elliott. Titled \"Silly Billy\", it was a reggae track, with some touches of the then popular ska style. Her daughter Celeste has called it 'similar to Althea and Donna, who she really liked'. She co-wrote the B-side \"What A Way\" with the record's producer, Falcon Stuart. The single came in a GTO Records sleeve.\n\nAfter watching a very early gig by the Sex Pistols in an empty hall on Hastings Pier, playing a set of cover songs, she was inspired to put an ad in the paper for 'young punx who want to stick it together' to form a band. So it was from that, she went as singer with X-Ray Spex, Poly Styrene, a name she chose from the 'Yellow Pages' when she was 'looking for a name of the time, something plastic.' She was described by \"Billboard\" as the \"archetype for the modern-day feminist punk\"; because she wore dental braces, stood against the typical sex object female of 1970s rock star, sported a gaudy Dayglo wardrobe, and was of mixed race. She was \"one of the least conventional front-persons in rock history, male or female\". They launched their debut single in 1977.\n\nIn 1978, after a gig in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, Styrene had a vision of a pink light in the sky and felt objects crackling when she touched them. Thinking she was hallucinating, her mother took her to the hospital where Marianne was misdiagnosed with schizophrenia, sectioned, and told she would never work again. Although she missed playing at the time, in hindsight, she felt that getting out of the public eye was good for her. She was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 1991.\n\nAfter the original line-up of X-Ray Spex broke up, Poly Styrene recorded a solo album, \"Translucence\", in 1980. The album abandoned X-Ray Spex's loud guitar work for a quieter and more jazzy sound that has since been described as anticipating later work by Everything but the Girl. In 1986, she released the EP \"God's & Godesses\" on the Awesome record label. A New Age solo album, \"Flower Aeroplane\", followed in 2004.\n\nShe described herself as \"an observer, not a suffering artist writing from tortured experiences. I was playing with words and ideas. Having a laugh about everything, sending it up.\"\n\nIn 2007, Styrene was invited to the Concrete Jungle festival in Camber Sands, by her friend Goldblade's John Robb where she and the gathering's organiser, Symond Lawes, agreed to initiate a 30-year celebration of X-Ray Spex's debut album, \"Germfree Adolescents\". They decided to hold a live show at the Camden Roundhouse, which was a sell-out event on 6 September 2008. A live album/DVD of this event, \"Live @ The Roundhouse London 2008\", was released in November 2009 on the Year Zero label by Future Noise Music.\n\nShe made a guest appearance at the 2008 30th anniversary concert of Rock Against Racism in Victoria Park, London, performing \"Oh Bondage Up Yours!\" with guest musicians Drew McConnell (of Babyshambles and Helsinki) and 'Flash' David Wright playing saxophone. That same year, she dueted with Goldblade's John Robb on a remix of Goldblade's \"City of Christmas Ghosts\".\n\nIn March 2009, Styrene joined other members of PRS for Music in criticising Google for allegedly not paying a fair share of royalties to musicians. This followed Google's removal of millions of videos from YouTube because of a royalties dispute with the organisation.\n\nNME.com announced on 29 October 2010 that Poly Styrene was to release a solo album titled \"Generation Indigo\", produced by Martin Glover (aka Youth from Killing Joke), in March 2011. She released a free download of \"Black Christmas\" in November 2010. Inspired by a Los Angeles killing spree of a man dressed as Santa Claus, \"Black Christmas\" was written in collaboration with her daughter, Celeste.\n\nStyrene announced \"Virtual Boyfriend\" as the first single from the new album \"Generation Indigo\" via Spinner Music, as well as the launch of her new website. \"Virtual Boyfriend\" was released on 21 March 2011, and featured an animated promotional video directed by Ben Wheele. \"Generation Indigo\" was released on 28 March 2011, via Future Noise Music. The album received critical acclaim, including a perfect 10 out of 10 score in \"Artrocker\" magazine, and 8 out of 10 in \"The Daily Telegraph\" newspaper. \"Generation Indigo\" was also chosen as Album of the Day on UK radio station BBC 6 Music. It was released in the US on 24 April 2011, the day before her death.\n\n\"Ghoulish\" was the first posthumous single to be released from \"Generation Indigo\", and was backed by a remix from Hercules and Love Affair.\n\n\"New York\" magazine's music journalist Nitsuh Abebe described her singing style with X-Ray Spex as \"in a bold, keening yelp\" and \"fierce but fiercely feminine.\"\n\nThe band U2 paid tribute to Styrene during the \"HerStory\" video tribute to notable women in 2017 for the 30th anniversary of \"The Joshua Tree\" during a performance of \"Ultraviolet (Light My Way)\" from the band's 1991 album \"Achtung Baby\".\n\nIn 1983, Styrene was initiated into the Hare Krishna movement and recorded at their recording studios while living as a devotee at Bhaktivedanta Manor. She lived as a Hare Krishna convert in Hertfordshire and London from 1983 to 1988. Styrene was a vegetarian.\n\nIn March 2009, Styrene took part in the inaugural Instigate Debate night. The night's theme was modern day consumerism. Other current issues were also discussed.\n\nShe lived in St Leonards, East Sussex.\n\nIn February 2011, in an interview published in \"The Sunday Times\" magazine, which largely focused on her past and present relationship with her daughter Celeste, Styrene revealed that she had been treated for breast cancer, and that it had spread to her spine and lungs. She died of metastatic breast cancer on 25 April 2011, at the age of 53.\n\nStyrene is the subject of an upcoming documentary \"Poly Styrene: I Am A Cliché\" that is being crowd-funded as of March 2017. The documentary was directed by Paul Sng and was co-written by Styrene's daughter Celeste Bell (who also narrates) and author Zoë Howe. The documentary comes in conjunction with the 40-year anniversary \"Germfree Adolescents\". \"This film will be a celebration of the life and work of my mother, an artist who deserves to be recognized as one of the greatest front women of all time; a little girl with a big voice whose words are more relevant than ever\" Bell said. Bell and Howe will also be co-authoring a biography about Styrene that is set for released in November 2018. The book entitled \"Day Glo: The Poly Styrene Story\" was released in the United States on September 2019.\n\n\n\n\n"}

ARMs are a spectrum of different congenital anomalies which vary from fairly minor lesions to complex anomalies. The cause of ARMs is unknown; the genetic basis of these anomalies is very complex because of their anatomical variability. In 8% of patients, genetic factors are clearly associated with ARMs. Anorectal malformation in Currarino syndrome represents the only association for which the gene \"HLXB9\" has been identified.\n\nThere are several forms of imperforate anus and anorectal malformations. The new classification is in relation of the type of associated fistula.\n\nThe classical Wingspread classification was in low and high anomalies:\nImperforate anus is usually present along with other birth defects—spinal problems, heart problems, tracheoesophageal fistula, esophageal atresia, renal anomalies and limb anomalies are among the possibilities, collectively being called the VACTERL association.\n\nImperforate anus is associated with an increased incidence of some other specific anomalies as well, together being called the VACTERL association.\n\nOther entities associated with an imperforate anus are trisomies 18 and 21, the cat-eye syndrome (partial trisomy or tetrasomy of a maternally derived chromosome 22), Baller–Gerold syndrome, Currarino syndrome, caudal regression syndrome, FG syndrome, Johanson–Blizzard syndrome, McKusick–Kaufman syndrome, Pallister–Hall syndrome, short rib–polydactyly syndrome type 1, Townes–Brocks syndrome, 13q deletion syndrome, urorectal septum malformation sequence and the OEIS complex (omphalocele, exstrophy of the cloaca, imperforate anus, spinal defects).\n\nWhen an infant is born with an anorectal malformation, it is usually detected quickly as it is a very obvious defect. Doctors will then determine the type of birth defect the child was born with and whether or not there are any associated malformations. It is important to determine the presence of any associated defects during the newborn period in order to treat them early and avoid further sequelae. There are two main categories of anorectal malformations: those that require a protective colostomy and those that do not. The decision to open a colostomy is usually taken within the first 24 hours of birth.\n\nSonography can be used to determine the type of imperforate anus.\n\nThere are other forms of anorectal malformations though imperforate anus is most common. Other variants include anterior ectopic anus. This form is more commonly seen in females and presents with constipation.\n\nImperforate anus usually requires immediate surgery to open a passage for feces unless a fistula can be relied on until corrective surgery takes place. Depending on the severity of the imperforate, it is treated either with a perineal anoplasty or with a colostomy.\n\nWhile many surgical techniques to definitively repair anorectal malformations have been described, the posterior sagittal approach (PSARP) has become the most popular. It involves dissection of the perineum without entry into the abdomen and 90% of defects in boys can be repaired this way.\n\nWith a high lesion, many children have problems controlling bowel function and most also become constipated. With a low lesion, children generally have good bowel control, but they may still become constipated.\n\nFor children who have a poor outcome for continence and constipation from the initial surgery, further surgery to better establish the angle between the anus and the rectum may improve continence and, for those with a large rectum, surgery to remove that dilated segment may significantly improve the bowel control for the patient. An antegrade enema mechanism can be established by joining the appendix to the skin (Malone stoma); however, establishing more normal anatomy is the priority.\n\nImperforate anus has an estimated incidence of 1 in 5000 births. It affects boys and girls with similar frequency. However, imperforate anus will present as the low version 90% of the time in females and 50% of the time in males.\n\nImperforate anus is an occasional complication of sacrococcygeal teratoma.\n\n7th-century Byzantine physician Paulus Aegineta described a surgical treatment for imperforate anus for the first time. 10th-century Persian physician Haly Abbas was the first to highlight preserving the sphincter muscles throughout the surgery and the prevention of strictures with a stent. He has reported the use of wine for wound care in this surgery. Some reports of survived children undergoing this surgery are available from the early medieval Islamic era.\n\n"}

{"id": "2224021", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2224021", "title": "Tibetan culture", "text": "Tibetan culture\n\nTibet developed a distinct culture due to its geographic and climatic conditions. While influenced by neighboring cultures from China, India, and Nepal, the Himalayan region's remoteness and inaccessibility have preserved distinct local influences, and stimulated the development of its distinct culture.\n\nTibetan Buddhism has exerted a particularly strong influence on Tibetan culture since its introduction in the seventh century. Buddhist missionaries who came mainly from India, Nepal and China introduced arts and customs from India and China. Art, literature, and music all contain elements of the prevailing Buddhist beliefs, and Buddhism itself has adopted a unique form in Tibet, influenced by the Bön tradition and other local beliefs.\n\nSeveral works on astronomy, astrology and medicine were translated from Sanskrit and Classical Chinese. The general appliances of civilization have come from China, among many things and skill imported were the making of butter, cheese, barley-beer, pottery, watermills and the national beverage, butter tea.\n\nTibet's specific geographic and climatic conditions have encouraged reliance on pastoralism, as well as the development of a different cuisine from surrounding regions, which fits the needs of the human body in these high altitudes.\n\nThe Tibetan language is spoken in a variety of dialects in all parts of the Tibetan-inhabited area which covers 1/2 Million square miles. Some of these dialects are tonal like the Chinese language, while others remain non-tonal. Historically Tibet was divided into three cultural provinces called U-Tsang, Kham and Amdo. Each one of these three provinces has developed its own distinct dialect of Tibetan. Most widely spoken is the Lhasa dialect, also called Standard Tibetan, which is spoken in Central Tibet and also in Exile by most Tibetans. In Kham the Khams Tibetan dialect is spoken and in Amdo the Amdo Tibetan dialect. The Tibetan dialects are subject to the Tibetic languages which are part of the Tibeto-Burman languages.\nModern Tibetan derives from Classical Tibetan, which is the written norm, and from Old Tibetan.\nThe official language of Bhutan, Dzongkha, is also closely related to Tibetan.\n\nTibetan art is deeply religious in nature, a form of religious art. It spreads over a wide range of paintings, frescos, statues, ritual objects, coins, ornaments and furniture.\nAs Mahayana Buddhism emerged as a separate school in the fourth century BCE. It emphasized the role of bodhisattvas, compassionate beings who forgo their personal escape to nirvana in order to assist others. From an early time various bodhisattvas were also subjects of statuary art. Tibetan Buddhism, as an offspring of Mahayana Buddhism, inherited this tradition.\n\nA common bodhisattva depicted in Tibetan art is the Avalokiteśvara, often portrayed as a four or a thousand-armed saint with an eye in the middle of each hand, representing the all-seeing compassionate one who hears our requests. The Dalai Lama is believed to be his reincarnation.\n\nMost of the typical Tibetan Buddhist art can be seen as part of the practice of tantra. A surprising aspect of Tantric Buddhism is the common representation of fierce deities, often depicted with angry faces, circles of flame, or with the skulls of the dead. These images represent Dharmapalas \"Protectors\"; their fearsome bearing belies their true compassionate nature. Their wrath represents their dedication to the protection of the dharma as well as to the protection of the specific tantric practices to prevent corruption or disruption of the practice.\n\nThe indigenous shamanistic religion of the Himalayas is known as Bön. Bön contributes a pantheon of local tutelary deities to Tibetan art. In Tibetan temples, known as \"lhakhang\", statues of Gautama Buddha or Padmasambhava are often paired with statues of the tutelary deity of the district who often appears angry or dark. These gods once inflicted harm and sickness on the local citizens but after the arrival of Padmasambhava, these negative forces have been subdued and now must serve Buddhism.\n\nTibetan rug making is an ancient art and craft in the tradition of Tibetan people. These rugs are primarily made from Tibetan highland sheep's virgin wool. The Tibetan uses rugs for almost any domestic use from flooring to wall hanging to horse saddles. Traditionally the best rugs are from Gyantse, a city which is known for its rugs.\n\nThe process of making Tibetan rugs is unique in the sense that almost everything is done by hand. But with the introduction of modern technology, a few aspects of the rug making processes have been taken over by machine primarily because of cost, the disappearance of knowledge etc. Moreover, some new finishing touches are also made possible by machine.\n\nTibetan rugs are big business in not only Tibet, but also Nepal, where Tibetan immigrants brought with them their knowledge of rug making. Currently in Nepal the rug business is one of the largest industries in the country and there are many rug exporters.\n\nThangkas, a syncrestistic art of Chinese hanging scrolls with Nepalese and Kashmiri painting, first survive from the eleventh century. Rectangular and intricately painted on cotton or linen, they are usually traditional compositions depicting deities, famous monks, and other religious, astrological, and theological subjects, and sometimes mandalas. To ensure that the image will not fade, the painting is framed in colorful silk brocades, and stored rolled up. The word \"thangka\" means \"something to roll\" and refers to the fact that thangkas can easily be rolled up for transportation.\n\nBesides thangkas, Tibetan Buddhist wall paintings can be found on temple walls as frescos and furniture and many other items have ornamental painting.\n\nThere is a rich ancient tradition of lay Tibetan literature which includes epics, poetry, short stories, dance scripts and mime, plays and so on which has expanded into a huge body of work - some of which has been translated into Western languages. Tibetan literature has a historical span of over 1300 years. Perhaps the best known category of Tibetan literature outside of Tibet are the epic stories - particularly the famous \"Epic of King Gesar\".\n\nTibetan architecture contains Chinese and Indian influences, and reflects a deeply Buddhist approach. The prayer wheel, along with two deer or dragons, can be seen on nearly every gompa in Tibet. The design of stupas (\"chörten\"s) can vary, from roundish walls in Kham to squarish, four-sided walls in Ladakh.\n\nThe most unusual feature of Tibetan architecture is that many of the houses and monasteries are built on elevated, sunny sites facing the south, and are often made of a mixture of rocks, wood, cement and earth. Little fuel is available for heat or lighting, so flat roofs are built to conserve heat, and multiple windows are constructed to let in sunlight. Walls are usually sloped inwards at 10 degrees as a precaution against frequent earthquakes in the mountainous area.\n\nStanding at 117 meters in height and 360 meters in width, the Potala Palace, designated as a World Heritage site in 1994 and extended to include the Norbulingka area in 2001, is considered a most important example of Tibetan architecture. Formerly the residence of the Dalai Lamas, it contains over a thousand rooms within thirteen stories, and houses portraits of the past Dalai Lamas and statues of the Buddha. It is divided into the outer White Palace, which serves as the administrative quarters, and the inner Red Quarters, which houses the assembly hall of the Lamas, chapels, 10,000 shrines and a vast library of Buddhist scriptures.\n\nTraditional Kham architecture is seen in most dwellings in Kangding. Kham houses tend to be spacious and fit in well with their environment. Their floors and ceilings are wooden, as houses are throughout in Kangding. [This article is dated. Modern Kangding city is now rebuilt, eliminating the earlier fire-prone wooden architecture]. Horizontal timber beams support the roof and these in turn are supported by wooden columns. Although the area has been heavily logged, wood is imported and used abundantly for housing. The Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Kham, surrounded by forests, is known for its beautiful wooden houses built in a range of styles and lavishly decorated with wooden ornamentation. The interiors of houses are usually paneled with wood and the cabinetry is ornately decorated. Although various materials are used in the well-built houses, it is the skilful carpentry that is striking. This skill is passed down from father to son and there appear to be plenty of carpenters. However a threat to traditional Tibetan carpentry is the growing use of concrete structures. Some consider the increased use of concrete as a deliberate infiltration of the Chinese influence into Tibet. In Gaba Township, where there are few Han Chinese, almost all the structures are traditional.\n\nThe events that took place in Tibet in the twentieth century exacted a heavy toll on Tibetan monastic architecture.\n\nUnder the 13th Dalai Lama, the Tengyeling monastery was demolished in 1914 for seeking to come to terms with the Chinese. Under Regent Taktra, the Sera monastery was bombarded with howitzers and ransacked by the Tibetan army in 1947 for siding with former regent Reting.\n\nIt is important to see that Sera monastery was by no means destroyed but only looted partially. The major destruction happened during the Cultural Revolution. China's Cultural Revolution resulted in the deterioration or loss of Buddhist monasteries, both by intentional destruction and through lack of protection and maintenance.\n\nStarting in the 1980s, Tibetans have begun to restore those monasteries that survived. This has become an international effort. Experts are teaching the Tibetans how to restore the building and save the remaining monasteries on the eastern plateau.\n\nMonasteries such as the Kumbum Monastery continue to be affected by Chinese politics. Simbiling Monastery was completely flattened in 1967, although it has to some degree been restored.\n\nTashi Lhunpo Monastery shows the influence of Mongol architecture. Tradruk Temple is one of the oldest in Tibet, said to have been first built in the 7th century during the reign of Songtsen Gampo of the Tibetan Empire (605?-650). Jokhang was also originally built under Songsten Gampo. Jokhang Temple is the most splendid surviving building of the Tubo period in Tibet and also the earliest civil structural building in Tibet. It integrated the architectural styles of Tibet, Tang Dynasty of China, Nepal, and India, and has become a model of Tibetan religious architecture for thousands of years. Tsurphu Monastery was founded by Düsum Khyenpa, 1st Karmapa Lama (1110–1193) in 1159, after he visited the site and laid the foundation for an establishment of a seat there by making offerings to the local protectors, dharmapalas and genius loci. In 1189 he revisited the site and founded his main seat there. The monastery grew to hold 1000 monks. Tsozong Gongba Monastery is a small shrine built around the fourteenth century Palcho Monastery was founded in 1418 and known for its kumbum which has 108 chapels on its four floors. Chokorgyel Monastery, founded in 1509 the 2nd Dalai Lama once housed 500 monks but was completely destroyed during the Cultural Revolution.\n\nRamoche Temple is an important temple in Lhasa. The original building complex was strongly influenced by Tang dynasty architectural style as it was first built by Han Chinese architects in the middle of the 7th century. Princess Wencheng took charge of this project and ordered the temple be erected facing east to show her homesickness.\n\nSee List of Tibetan monasteries.\n\nTibetans tend to be conservative in their dress, and though some have taken to wearing Western clothes, traditional styles still abound. Women wear dark-colored wrap dresses over a blouse, and a colorfully striped, woven wool apron, called \"pangden\" signals that she is married. Men and women both wear long sleeves even in summer months.\n\nIn his 1955 book, \"Tibetan Marches\", André Migot describes Tibetan clothing as follows:\n\nThe Cuisine of Tibet is quite distinct from that of its neighbours. Tibetan crops must be able to grow at high altitudes, although a few areas in Tibet are low enough to grow such crops as rice, oranges, lemon and bananas. The most important crop in Tibet is barley. Flour milled from roasted barley, called \"tsampa\", is the staple food of Tibet. It is eaten mostly mixed with the national beverage, the butter tea. Butter tea perfectly fits the needs of the human body in these high altitudes as it contains butter (protein and fat), milk (protein, fat and calcium), salt and tea. Tibetan cuisine contains a wide variety of dishes. The most famous are Momos (Tibetan dumplings). \"Balep\" is Tibetan bread eaten for breakfast and lunch. There many other types of balep bread and fried pies. \"Thukpa\" is noodle soup. It consists of noodles of various shapes, vegetables, and meat in broth. Tibetan cuisine is traditionally served with bamboo chopsticks, in contrast to other Himalayan cuisines which are eaten by hand. Small soup bowls are also used by Tibetans, and the rich are known to have used bowls of gold and silver.\nSince only a few crops grow at such high altitudes, many features of Tibetan cuisine are imported, such as tea, rice and others. Meat dishes are likely to be yak, goat, or mutton, often dried, or cooked into a spicy stew with potatoes. Tibetans would never eat dogs and fish only in special cases as dogs are regarded as domestic animals and also guard dogs, and fishes are one of the Eight Auspicious Symbols of Buddhism.\n\nMustard seed is cultivated in Tibet, and therefore features strongly in its cuisine. Yak yogurt, butter and cheese are frequently eaten, and well-prepared yogurt is considered something of a prestige item.\n\nIn larger Tibetan towns and cities many restaurants nowadays serve Sichuan-style Chinese food. Western imports and fusion dishes, such as fried yak and chips, are also popular. Nevertheless, many small restaurants serving traditional Tibetan dishes persist in both cities and the countryside.\n\nJasmine tea and yak butter tea are drunk. Alcoholic beverages include:\n\nTibetans traditionally venerate their elders within their families.\n\nTibetans used to practice polyandry widely. In his memoirs about his life in Tibet in the 1940s, Austrian writer Heinrich Harrer reports encountering nomads practising polyandry: \"We were astonished to find polyandry practised among the nomads.\" \"When several brothers share the same wife, the eldest is always the master in the household and the others have rights only when he is away or amusing himself elsewhere.\"\n\nHarrer also mentions the practice of polygyny in one particular case: a man marrying \"several daughters of a house in which there is no son and heir.\" \"The arrangement prevents the family fortune from being dispersed.\"\n\nThe Tibetan calendar is the lunisolar calendar, that is, the Tibetan year is composed of either 12 or 13 lunar months, each beginning and ending with a new moon. A thirteenth month is added approximately every three years, so that an average Tibetan year is equal to the solar year. The name of the months are ༼ མཆུ་ཟླ་བ།༽ January, ༼ དབོ་ཟླ་བ།༽ February, ༼ ནག་པ་ཟླ་བ།༽་ March, ༼ ས་ག་ཟླ་བ།་༽ April, ༼ ༽སྣྲོན་ཟླ་བ།༽ May, ༼ ཆུ་སྟོད་ཟླ་བ།༽ June, ༼ གྲོ་བཞིན་ཟླ་བ།༽ July, ༼ ཁྲུམས་སྟདོ།༽ August, ༼ དབྱུ་གུ་ཟླ་བ།༽ September, ༼ སྨིན་དྲུག་ཟླ་བ།༽ October, ༼ གོ་ཟླ་བ།༽ November and ༼ རྒྱལ་ཟླ་བ།༽ December.\n\nThe Tibetan New Year celebration is Losar.\n\nEach year is associated with an animal and an element. The animals alternate in the following order:\n\nThe elements alternate in the following order:\n\nEach element is associated with two consecutive years, first in its male aspect, then in its female aspect. For example, a male Earth-Dragon year is followed by a female Earth-Snake year, then by a male Iron-Horse year. The sex may be omitted, as it can be inferred from the animal.\n\nThe element-animal designations recur in cycles of 60 years, starting with a (female) Fire-Rabbit year. These big cycles are numbered. The first cycle started in 1027. Therefore, 2005 roughly corresponds to the (female) Wood-Rooster year of the 17th cycle, and 2008 corresponds to a (male) Earth-Rat year of the same cycle.\n\nThe days of the week are named for celestial bodies.\n\nNyima \"Sun\", Dawa \"Moon\" and Lhakpa \"Mercury\" are common personal names for people born on Sunday, Monday or Wednesday respectively.\n\n\nA Khata is a traditional ceremonial scarf given in Tibet. It symbolizes goodwill, auspiciousness and compassion. It is usually made of silk, and the color is generally white to symbolise the pure heart of the giver. Purity is an important aspect of the Khata. It would be regarded impolite, even rude, to offer a dirty Khata.\n\nThe khata is a highly versatile gift. It can be presented at any festive occasions to a host or at weddings, funerals, births, graduations, arrivals and departure of guests etc. The Tibetans commonly give a kind acknowledgment of \"Tashi Delek\" (meaning good luck) at the time of presenting.\n\nA gift traditionally given at the time of a new birth is that of an ibex figurine, as described below by August Hermann Francke.\n\n\"Our Christian evangelist at Khalatse had become a father a few weeks before, and the people of the village had made presents of \"flour-ibex\" to him and his wife. He gave me one of those figures, which are made of flour and butter, and told me that it was a custom in Tibet and Ladakh, to make presents of \"flour-ibex\" on the occasion of the birth of a child. This is quite interesting information. I had often wondered why there were so many rock carvings of ibex at places connected with the pre-Buddhist religion of Ladakh. Now it appears probable that they are thank offerings after the birth of children. As I have tried to show in my previous article, people used to go to the pre-Buddhist places of worship, in particular, to pray to be blessed with children.\"\n\nThe music of Tibet reflects the cultural heritage of the trans-Himalayan region, centered in Tibet but also known wherever ethnic Tibetan groups are found in India, Bhutan, Nepal and further abroad. First and foremost Tibetan music is religious music, reflecting the profound influence of Tibetan Buddhism on the culture.\n\nTibetan music often involves chanting in Tibetan or Sanskrit as an integral part of the religion. These chants are complex, often recitations of sacred texts or in celebration of various festivals. Yang chanting, performed without metrical timing, is accompanied by resonant drums and low, sustained syllables. Other styles include those unique to the various schools of Tibetan Buddhism, such as the classical music of the popular Gelug school and the romantic music of the Nyingma, Sakya and Kagyu schools.\n\nSecular Tibetan music has been promoted by organizations like the 14th Dalai Lama's Tibetan Institute of Performing Arts. This organization specialized in the lhamo, an operatic style, before branching out into other styles, including dance music like toeshey and nangma. Nangma is especially popular in the karaoke bars of the urban center of Tibet, Lhasa. Another form of popular music is the classical gar style, which is performed at rituals and ceremonies. Lu are a type of songs that feature glottal vibrations and high pitches which are typically sung by nomads. There are also epic bards who sing of Tibet's national hero, Gesar.\n\nTibetans are well represented in Chinese popular culture. Tibetan singers are particularly known for their strong vocal abilities, which many attribute to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. Tseten Dolma (才旦卓玛) rose to fame in the 1960s for her music-and-dance suite \"The Earth is Red\". Kelsang Metok (格桑梅朵) is a popular singer who combines traditional Tibetan songs with elements of Chinese and Western pop. Purba Rgyal (Pubajia or 蒲巴甲) was the 2006 winner of Haonaner, the Chinese version of American Idol. In 2006, he starred in Sherwood Hu's \"Prince of the Himalayas\", an adaptation of Shakespeare's Hamlet, set in ancient Tibet and featuring an all-Tibetan cast.\n\nTibetan music has influenced certain styles of Western music, such as new-age. Philip Glass, Henry Eichheim and other composers are known for Tibetan elements in their music. The first Western fusion with Tibetan music was \"Tibetan Bells\" in 1971. The soundtrack to \"Kundun\", by Glass, has also popularized Tibetan music in the West.\nForeign styles of popular music have also had a major impact within Tibet. Indian ghazal and filmi are very popular, as is rock and roll, an American style which has produced Tibetan performers like Rangzen Shonu. Since the relaxation of some laws in the 1980s, Tibetan pop, popularized by the likes of Yadong, Jampa Tsering, 3-member group AJIA, 4-member group Gao Yuan Hong, 5-member group Gao Yuan Feng, and Dechen Shak-Dagsay are well-known, as are the sometimes politicized lyrics of nangma. Gaoyuan Hong in particular has introduced elements of Tibetan language rapping into their singles.\n\nThe Tibetan folk opera known as \"(Ache) Lhamo\" \"(sister) goddess\", is a combination of dances, chants and songs. The repertoire is drawn from Buddhist stories and Tibetan history. Lhamo was founded in the fourteenth century by the Thang Tong Gyalpo, a lama and important historical civil engineer. Gyalpo and seven recruited girls organized the first performance to raise funds for building bridges that would facilitate transportation in Tibet. The tradition continued, and lhamo is held on various festive occasions such as the Linka and Shoton festivals.\n\nThe performance is usually a drama, held on a barren stage, that combines dances, chants and songs. Colorful masks are sometimes worn to identify a character, with red symbolizing a king and yellow indicating deities and lamas.\n\nThe performance starts with a stage purification and blessings. A narrator then sings a summary of the story, and the performance begins. Another ritual blessing is conducted at the end of the play.\n\nTibetan festivals such as Losar, Shoton, the Bathing Festival and many more are deeply rooted in indigenous religion, and also contain foreign influences. Tibetan festivals are a high source of entertainment and can include many sports such as yak racing. Tibetans consider festivals as an integral part of their life and almost everyone participates in the festivities.\n\nSince 2010, thousands of ethnic Tibetans worldwide have called on Unicode Consortium and social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to approve and also release the Tibetan flag emoji. The main purpose of this is to help evoke their sense of belonging to regional and cultural Tibet via online means and also to further spread the Tibetan culture and representation across borders.\n\nHowever, as of August 2019, despite the efforts of members of the Emoji Subcommittee and Unicode’s negotiating body (and Unicode’s official admission that the flag proposal is strong), the decision-making process of approval and eventual release of the Tibetan flag emoji by Unicode has been and remained stalled. This is probably due to strong opposition by millions of Mainland Chinese citizens, Mainland Chinese members of Unicode Consortium and the Chinese government’s willingness to place economic sanctions against the company if Unicode ‘unilaterally’ releases the Tibetan flag emoji (unless China returns to a state of democracy and is willing to support the rights and freedoms of Tibetans in Tibet Autonomous Region).\n\nNonetheless, Tibetans across the globe have been pushing on. In light of the ongoing 2019 Hong Kong protests that have been taking place since June 2019 and subsequent Mainland Chinese interference in major social media platforms, Tibetans have called or are calling for Unicode to extend the timeline for at least one more year, to ensure the elimination of Mainland Chinese influence in operations conducted by social media platforms and Unicode before prioritising on the eventual acceptance and release of the Tibetan flag emoji to the public. The flag emoji may only be released in Emoji 13.0, 14.0 or later, depending on the socio-political circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Martínez switched parties to become a Republican after being defeated in a 2000 primary.\n\nMartínez's family moved to Los Angeles, California, when he was young, and he attended public schools in Los Angeles. In 1949 he graduated from Roosevelt High School. From 1947 to 1950 he served in the U.S. Marine Corps, achieving the rank of private first class. In 1956 he received a certificate of competence from the Los Angeles Trade-Technical College.\n\nFor the next fifteen years he owned and operated a custom furniture upholstery company and worked as a building contractor.\n\nHe began his political career in 1971 when he became a member of the Monterey Park Planning Commission, and served until 1974 when he was elected to the Monterey Park City Council. He served until 1980, including two terms as mayor in 1974 and 1980.\n\nIn 1980, Martínez defeated incumbent Jack R. Fenton in the Democratic primary election in California's 59th State Assembly district. He was elected to the California State Assembly with no major-party opponent.\n\nIn 1982 George E. Danielson left the U.S. House of Representatives to take the bench. Martínez won the special election to succeed him, and was reelected nine times by varying margins.\n\nIn his first term in Congress he was assigned to the Education and Labor Committee. In the 99th Congress (1985–87) he chaired the Subcommittee on Employment Opportunities. In 1991, he became the Chairman of the Human Resources Subcommittee. In 1992, Martínez was named to the Foreign Affairs Committee, and served on the Subcommittee on International Security, International Organizations and Human Rights.\n\nIn 2000, Martínez was defeated in the Democratic primary by liberal State Senator Hilda Solis 62% to 29%. She charged that he was out of touch with his district when he voted to ban partial-birth abortion and opposed gun control. (He was both Roman Catholic and a member of the National Rifle Association.) While he had been a reliably Democratic vote on most issues throughout his congressional career, after his primary loss Martínez began to vote overwhelmingly with Republicans. On July 27, 2000, Martínez switched to the Republican Party, arguing that the Democrats had abandoned him. There was no Republican candidate on the ballot in the district for the 2000 election, and Martínez declined to attempt a write-in candidacy, though he remained critical of Solis and promised to stay active in the Republican party. His term in Congress ended on January 3, 2001, at the end of the 106th Congress.\n\nMartínez was married to Elvira Yorba Martinez, with whom he had five children: Matthew Adrian, Michael Gilbert, Diane, Susan, and Carol Ann.

{"id": "2224039", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2224039", "title": "The Albion Band", "text": "The Albion Band\n\nThe Albion Band, also known as The Albion Country Band, The Albion Dance Band, and The Albion Christmas Band, were a British folk rock band, originally brought together and led by musician Ashley Hutchings. Generally considered one of the most important groupings in the genre, it has contained or been associated with a large proportion of major English folk performers in its long and fluid history.\n\nThe one constant in the band’s history has been the band leader Ashley Hutchings, founding member of arguably the two other pre-eminent English folk rock groupings Fairport Convention and Steeleye Span, and it has been the home for most of the projects of his long and highly productive career, though in the 2011 incarnation of the band he has handed over the reins to his son Blair Dunlop.\n\nInitially Hutchings formed the band in April 1971 to accompany his then wife the singer Shirley Collins on her \"No Roses\" album. Dave Mattacks, Richard Thompson and Simon Nicol, from Fairport Convention, beside such luminaries as Lal and Mike Waterson of The Watersons and Maddy Prior, were among twenty five credited backing musicians. On a short tour, core members were joined by Richard Thompson and his then wife Linda Thompson. Several members contributed with Hutchings to the project \"Morris On\" (1972), including John Kirkpatrick, Richard Thompson and Dave Mattacks, and cumbersomely all their names appeared on the album cover.\n\nHutchings was keen to make a permanent band from these musicians and the first attempt included Royston Wood, Steve Ashley and Sue Draheim in the line-up, but the group failed to gel and he recruited a second band, turning to Martin Carthy, John Kirkpatrick, Sue Harris, Roger Swallow and Simon Nicol. The band remained fragile and split in August 1973, but an album was released retrospectively under the title \"Battle of the Field\", on Island Records in 1976. Other material recorded by this line-up eventually appeared on the later \"BBC Sessions\" CD (1998).\n\nFrom 1974 to 1975, Hutchings abandoned the Albion name and focused on forming the Etchingham Steam Band with his wife Shirley Collins. However, in 1976 he pulled together a new Albion Band, this time with the aim of playing traditional dance music. It had a huge and unstable membership that included Simon Nicol, Graeme Taylor from Gryphon, the early musicians Phil Pickett and John Sothcott, fiddle player Ric Sanders, plus John Tams, one of folk music’s most distinctive and highly regarded vocalists. The immediate result was a lively traditional based album \"The Prospect Before Us\" under the name The Albion Dance Band. In 1978 they shortened the name to The Albion Band (which has remained the basis of the group’s identity since) and released, under Tams' direction, what is usually considered the finest album in the long history of the band \"Rise Up Like the Sun\" (1978).\n\nThe band took part in a 1977 TV show \"Here We Come A-Wasseling\" and in 1978-9 collaborated with playwright Keith Dewhurst for a stage adaptation of British author Flora Thompson’s \"Lark Rise to Candleford\", tracks from which were released as an album in 1980. The band was probably at the height of its mainstream profile at this point, getting its own BBC \"Arena\" documentary that explored their work. While Hutchings was more interested in pursuing theatrical possibilities, many members of the band wanted to be a touring and recording band and, despite critical acclaim, this line-up split. Tams, Taylor and Gregory went on to form the nucleus of Home Service. Live material from this period has been released in \"Songs from the Shows\" (1997 and 1999) and \"The Guvnor\", Vols 1-4 (1996–2004).\n\nHutchings reformed the band around the nucleus of the remaining ex-Fairporters Nicol and Mattacks. He added three members of Cock and Bull (Dave Whetstone, Jean-Pierre Rasle and John Maxwell) and for the first time on record, opted for a lead female vocalist in Cathy Lesurf of the Oyster Band, whose tones characterize most recordings from this era. Probably the best album of this relatively stable period was \"Light Shining\" (1983), on which most of the tracks were original material. However, the reputation of the album has since been marred by accusations that Hutchings plagiarized one of its best songs, \"Wolfe,\" from \"Northwest Passage\" by Canadian folksinger Stan Rogers. \"Shuffle Off\" (1983) followed, after which Nicol and Mattacks left to reform Fairport Convention. Phil Beer on guitar/fiddle/vocals and Trevor Foster on drums joined the band, and \"Under the Rose\" (1984), \"A Christmas Present From The Albion Band\" (1985) and \"The Wild Side of Town\" (1987) followed, the last of which was based on a five-part BBC television series presented by Chris Baines. The line-up then shifted with Martin Bell joining on violin before the release of \"Stella Maris\" in (1987). Martin Bell and Cathy Lesurf then left and the group were joined by Simon Care and John Shepherd. This was the most stable lineup in the band's history in terms of albums, producing three: \"I Got New Shoes\" (1988), \"Give Me a Saddle and I'll Trade you a Car\" (1989) and \"1990\" in the year of that name.\n\nIn 1990 they were joined by singer-songwriter and instrumentalist Julie Matthews, but although they toured they produced no albums before her departure in 1993. Some sessions from this line-up surfaced as \"Captured\" in 1995. Trevor Foster and Phil Beer left and were temporarily replaced by virtuoso acoustic guitarist Keith Hinchliffe shifting the emphasis away from electric instruments. In 1993 Hutchings decided to follow this trend turning the band into a small four piece unit comprising himself, Julie Matthews’ replacement Chris While, original member Simon Nicol, and Ashley Reed on violin. This allowed them to play small folk club, pub and college venues and gave the Band a whole new direction, now drawing on contemporary songwriters like Beth Nielsen Chapman and Steve Knightley as well as the internal songwriting talent of While and Hutchings. The first studio album of this period \"Acousticity\" (1993) had a more lively and contemporary feel, aided by Reed’s energetic playing. In 1995 Reed left and Matthews returned to the band to add her vocal, instrumental and considerable songwriting talents. The resulting album, \"Albion Heart\" (1995), is usually considered the best of this later period and marked the beginning of While and Matthews’ long and productive partnership. It was also unusual for the lack of traditional folk instruments and the four were soon joined by violinist and mandolin player Chris Leslie for the last recording of this era \"Demi Paradise\" (1996), before Leslie left for Fairport Convention and While and Matthews for solo and joint projects. Live performances of this era have been released as \"Acousticity on Tour\" (2004) and \"Albion Heart on Tour\" (2004).\n\nThe last phase of the full band would be based around a return to a more traditional rock format and the incorporation of two generations of musicians. Hutchings called in experienced guitarist and writer Ken Nicol and added newcomers Joe Broughton on fiddle and Neil Marshall on drums. Female vocals were supplied by Kellie While and Gillie Nicholls, who were guests on the first studio album of this era, \"Happy Accident\" (1998). Gillie Nicolls was a full member of the band for the second outing \"Before Us Stands Yesterday\" (1999), but was then replaced by Kellie While for the recording of \"The Christmas Album\" later that year and for \"Road Movies\" (2001), their last studio project. Ken Nicol left to be replaced by Pete Zorn, but it was becoming increasingly hard to find venues of a suitable size and in 2002 it was decided to suspend the band.\n\nTheir 1999 album \"Ridgeriders\" also saw them reunite with former members of the band.\n\nWhile Hutchings continued to pursue other projects he revived the Albion Band in an acoustic format for seasonal tours in 2005, allowing them to play smaller venues which could usually be easily filled. The line-up is based around Simon Nicol, Kellie While and multi-instrumentalist Simon Care. The results have been three further seasonal albums: \"An Albion Christmas\" (2005),\" Winter Songs\" (2006), and \"Snow on Snow\" (2008). A fourth album \"Traditional\" (2009) is a compilation of tracks from the preceding three which excludes spoken word recordings.\n\nIn July 2011, Hutchings announced that the Albion Band would be forming again, and for the first time he himself would not be a member. Instead he passed the baton to his son - the guitarist and singer Blair Dunlop. This new line-up also features a number of other current folk performers from a range of backgrounds reflecting earlier versions of the Albion Band. These members include Folk Award nominee Katriona Gilmore (Tiny Tin Lady, Gilmore/Roberts) on fiddle and vocals, vocalist, concertina player and guitarist Gavin Davenport (Crucible, Glorystrokes, Hekety), drummer Tom Wright (Eliza Carthy projects/Glorystrokes), and Tim Yates (Blackbeard's Tea Party/The QP) on bass - only the second bass player in the band's history, and lead guitarist and relative newcomer Benjamin Trott. This line-up released an own label EP \"Fighting Room\" in 2011 and their first studio album \"Vice of the People\" in 2012.\n\nOn 10 January 2014, Dunlop announced the friendly dissolution of the band \"in the current incarnation\", to allow its members to pursue individual projects. In his letter, he does state that they will undoubtedly work together in the future.\n\nPast members include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2224056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2224056", "title": "Uni (mythology)", "text": "Uni (mythology)\n\nUni is the ancient goddess of marriage, fertility, family, and women in Etruscan religion and myth, and the patron goddess of Perugia. She is identified as the Etruscan equivalent of Juno in Roman mythology, and Hera in Greek mythology. As the supreme goddess of the Etruscan pantheon, she is part of the Etruscan trinity, an original precursor to the Capitoline Triad, made up of her husband Tinia, the god of the sky, and daughter Menrva, the goddess of wisdom.\n\nShe is often depicted with a goatskin cloak and sandals whilst holding a shield, similarly to Juno, wearing a bridal veil, or completely nude.\n\nLivy states (Book V, \"Ab Urbe Condita\") that Juno was an Etruscan goddess of the Veientes, who was adopted ceremonially into the Roman pantheon when Veii was sacked in 396 BC. This seems to refer to Uni. She also appears on the Liver of Piacenza.\n\nThe name Uni is of uncertain etymology, however may be related to an Indo-European root \"iuni\" meaning \"young\", connecting to her association with fertility, love, and marriage. In relation, it has also been suggested that the Latin \"Iuno\" (Juno) originated from Etruscan, changed from a feminine \"-i\" Etruscan ending.\n\nAs most of Etruscan literature has not survived through time, mythological stories involving the Etruscan gods have been largely interpreted through engraved scenes in bronze mirrors, and other mixed media artworks.\n\nA notable mirror from Volterra depicts Uni nursing an adult demigod Hercle (the Greek Heracles or Roman Hercules). Tinia, amongst other gods present at the scene, points to a tablet with the inscription indicating the significance of the event: \"\"eca: sren: tva: iχnac hercle:unial clan: θra:sce\"\" meaning \"this picture shows how Hercle mecame Uni's son\". In other depictions of this myth, deities such as Menrva, Turan, and Mean - the goddess of victory - are present as part of an animated crowd bearing witness to the adoption.\n\nThe motif of Hercle suckling Uni is understood as holding Greek origins, where counterpart Hera was unknowingly deceived by Zeus (Tinia) into nursing, and by that process adopting, an infant Heracles against her will.\n\nDepiction of this myth in which the adoption process features an adult Hercle, and an obliging Uni is widely acknowledged as having developed entirely in Etruria. Most scholars view this interpretation of the myth as the Hercle's welcome initiation to godhood; it has also been suggested that the scene represents Uni and Hercle's reconciliation, where the Etruscan recount accurately represents the meaning of Hercle's Greek name \"Glory of Hera\".\n\nUni, alongside Tinia and Menrva, acts as one of the three deities which make up the Etruscan Trinity, equivalent to the roman Capitoline Triad. Most scholars agree that this triad was imported by the Romans from original Etruscan custom, where Uni and Menrva traditionally played larger roles than their counterparts Juno and Minerva.\n\nUni was worshipped both individually at dedicated shrines, and alongside other deities as part of large public sanctuaries throughout Etruria. Established cults to Uni worshipped her status as a supreme goddess of family and reproduction.\n\nAs part of a large Tuscan style temple, the north-located shrine at Pyrgi dedicated to Uni was built in approximately 500 BC, and neighboured a smaller Greek temple. Compared to other locations, the cult of worship dedicated to Uni at Pyrgi held close resemblance to traditional Greek worship sanctuaries; at least 300 votive objects were dedicated there, alongside animal bones suggestive of sacrifice. Additionally, two bowls made by the Etruscan Spurinas designated \"vota\"to Uni alongside Tinia and Thesan.\nUni appears in the Etruscan text on the Pyrgi Tablets as the translation of the Phoenician goddess Astarte.\n\nUni was likely worshipped as a fertility deity and mother figure by the people of northern Etruria, Italy.\nIn 2016 an ancient Etruscan stone slab dated to the 6th century BC, was found at the Etruscan archaeological site Poggio Colla, located near the town of Vicchio in the Mugello region of northern Tuscany. This inscription contains the name of the goddess:\n\n\"The mention of the goddess Uni is included as part of a sacred text that could be the longest Etruscan inscription of its kind ever discovered on stone, and one of the three longest sacred texts to date, according to lead researcher, P. Gregory Warden, from the Mugello Valley Archaeological Project and the Southern Methodist University in Texas\".\n\nThe archaeologists have tentatively linked Uni's mention to the existence of an underground cult at the sanctuary, based on the way the stele was placed in the foundations of the temple:\n\"The centre of worship was an underground fissure that was ritually treated after the destruction of the temple,\" he said. \"Underground cults of this type were often associated with female divinities.\"\n"}
{"id": "2224059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2224059", "title": "Battle of Longue-Pointe", "text": "Battle of Longue-Pointe\n\nThe Battle of Longue-Pointe was an attempt by Ethan Allen and a small force of American and Quebec militia to capture Montreal from British forces on September 25, 1775, early in the American Revolutionary War. Allen, who had been instructed only to raise militia forces among the local inhabitants, had long had thoughts of taking the lightly defended city. When he reached the southern shore of the St. Lawrence River with about 110 men, he seized the opportunity to try. Major John Brown, who Allen claimed was supposed to provide additional forces, did not appear as they had planned, isolating Allen and his men on the north side of the river.\n\nBritish General Guy Carleton sent a force composed mostly of Quebec militia in response to news of Allen's crossing of the St. Lawrence. This force cut off Allen's escape route, and eventually surrounded and captured Allen and a number of his men. Carleton eventually abandoned Montreal, which fell without battle to Continental Army forces on November 13. Allen was sent first to England and then New York City as a prisoner, and was eventually exchanged in 1778.\n\nIn the 18th century, the city of Montreal occupied only a small portion of the island of Montreal, centered on what is now called Old Montreal. The eastern tip of the island was called \"Longue-Pointe\", and there was at one time a fortification called Fort Longue Pointe on the island, across the river from Longueuil. This area, annexed to Montreal in 1910, and now the Mercier-Est neighborhood of Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, a borough of the city, is near where the action described here took place.\n\nWith the American Revolutionary War beginning, many thought it would be easy to spread the rebellion to the Province of Quebec, which had only been conquered by the British in 1759, and whose population was seen as resentful of British rule. The American invasion of Quebec began with the arrival at Île aux Noix of the Continental Army under the command of General Philip Schuyler on September 4, 1775. Schuyler, who was ill at the time, eventually turned command of the army over to General Richard Montgomery, who ordered the army to besiege Fort Saint-Jean, which they did on September 18. At this fort, south of Montreal on the Richelieu River, General Guy Carleton had concentrated the few British regulars at his disposal following the capture of Fort Ticonderoga in May.\n\nBefore turning command over to Montgomery, Schuyler drafted a proclamation addressed to the people of Quebec, encouraging them to oppose the British and assist the American cause. On September 8 Ethan Allen and Major John Brown went into the countryside between Saint-Jean and Montreal with a small detachment of Americans to circulate this proclamation, meeting with James Livingston, a Patriot sympathizer at Chambly as well as with the local Caughnawaga Mohawk. Livingston eventually raised about 300 local militia, which he encamped at Pointe-Olivier, below Fort Chambly. Allen and Brown returned to Île aux Noix following this tour.\n\nAllen had long harboured the goal of taking Montreal. After he and Benedict Arnold captured Fort Ticonderoga in May 1775, he had taken a few hundred men north from Ticonderoga to Saint-Jean with the idea of capturing the fort there by surprise, and then taking Montreal. This effort was frustrated by the timely arrival of British troops at Saint-Jean; the exploit made Allen a well-known figure in Montreal and the Richelieu valley.\n\nFollowing the capture of Fort Ticonderoga in May 1775, General Carleton, with only 800 regular troops available to defend the entire province, had concentrated those troops at Fort Saint-Jean, placing about 500 troops, along with about 250 militia and natives, at the fort. The remaining forces were distributed among the frontier forts along the Great Lakes, with relatively small garrisons at Montreal, Trois-Rivières, and Quebec City. During the summer of 1775 he attempted to raise substantial additional militia forces from the population. These attempts met with limited success, in part because of successful American propaganda and agitation by Patriot sympathizers, especially Thomas Walker, James Price, and James Livingston. By July, Carleton was apparently satisfied with the level of militia support near Montreal, but he did little to stop the activities of the agitators, who also sent reports detailing British military preparations to the Americans.\n\nWhen Montgomery finally began the siege of Fort Saint-Jean, he ordered Allen and about 30 Americans to join with Livingston's Canadians to secure the south bank of the St. Lawrence River against attempts by Carleton in Montreal to relieve the siege. He also ordered a larger force under Brown's command to secure the area north of the fort, and to cover the road between Saint-Jean and Montreal.\n\nAllen traveled along the southeastern banks of the Richelieu River, up to Sorel, where he crossed that river and continued up the southern shore of the St. Lawrence to Longueuil. According to Allen's account, he met Brown there, and the two of them then hatched a plan to attack Montreal. Brown would cross the river with 200 men at La Prairie, upriver from Montreal, and Allen, with his Americans and 80 Canadians under the command of Loiseau and Duggan, two of Livingston's captains, would cross the river at Longueuil, below the city, and the two forces would, after a prearranged signal, converge on the city itself.\n\nAllen and his men crossed the St. Lawrence on the night of the 24th, landing at Longue-Pointe. The inhabitants he met there were friendly, but he posted guards on the road to Montreal to prevent news of their crossing from reaching the city. However, one man they detained managed to escape to the city and inform Carleton of Allen's presence on the island. Brown did not cross the river. While no sources indicate why Brown failed to act, historian Justin Smith suggests that Allen in fact acted alone, and only later sought to blame Brown for the endeavour's failure. This left Allen's force alone and vulnerable, as it had taken three round trips with the available boats to ferry his men across the river.\n\nRealizing he would not be able ferry everyone back across the river before troops arrived from the city, Allen chose a wooded area near the Ruisseau-des-Sœurs (labelled on the map above as \"Ruisseau de la G Prairie\"), between Longue-Pointe and Montreal, to make a stand. He also sent word to Thomas Walker, a British merchant and known Patriot sympathizer with a house in nearby L'Assomption, for assistance. Walker was able to muster some men, but Allen was captured before they could lend any assistance.\n\nWhen General Carleton received word that the notorious Ethan Allen was at the gates of the city, he raised the alarm. As the news spread, large numbers of people turned out. Captain John Campbell assembled a force of 34 regulars from the 26th Foot (the entire garrison in Montreal), 120 Canadien and 80 English militia, 20 British Indian agents, and a few Indians, and led them out to face Allen's force. As Campbell's force approached, Allen instructed 10 Canadians to cover his left flank, while Duggan and another 50 Canadians were placed on the right flank. Both of these detachments fled instead of holding their positions, leaving Allen with about 50 men. Over the course of the next 90 minutes, fire was exchanged between the forces. Allen's remaining forces were eventually broken, and, after trying to outrun the enemy, he surrendered.\n\nThe abortive attack on Montreal led to the full mobilization of local militia in Montreal, raising nearly 1,000 men, but they soon began to drift away. Carleton refused to organize an expedition in relief of Fort Saint-Jean, and the militia members from rural parishes eventually disbanded to attend to their harvests and the defense of their own homes. In November, the besieged fort's commander capitulated, opening the Americans' way to Montreal. Carleton fled the city, making his way to Quebec City, and Montgomery occupied Montreal without firing a shot on November 13.\n\nAllen and the other captives were brought to the city. Allen, in his account of the encounter, claims that Colonel Richard Prescott was intent on killing the captured Canadiens, but Allen interceded on their behalf, saying \"I am the sole cause of their taking up arms.\" Allen was imprisoned in a ship's hold, and eventually sent to England. He spent about a year, mostly on prison ships, before he was released on parole in British-occupied New York City in November 1776, as the British authorities feared hanging him would create a martyr. He was eventually exchanged in May 1778 for Archibald Campbell, a British officer, and resumed military and political service for the nascent Republic of Vermont in 1778.\n\nThomas Walker, the merchant to whom Allen had applied for assistance, was arrested in early October 1775 when twenty regulars and a dozen militia came from Montreal to his house in L'Assomption. Walker's house was destroyed, and he was imprisoned with the intent of sending him to England for trial. Walker was eventually freed when the Americans captured Montreal and most of the British fleet trying to escape the city.\n\nEthan Allen wrote a memoir recounting his version of the circumstances of his capture, and the time of his imprisonment. This work, along with Allen's other memoirs, were quite popular in the 19th century, going through numerous printings. A city park in the Montreal borough of Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, where the action took place, is called \"Parc de la Capture-d'Ethan-Allen\".\n\n"}

He is a two-time World Superbike champion and competed in the MotoGP class from 2003 to 2014.\n\nEdwards was born in Houston, Texas. At the age of three, his Australian father, Colin Edwards Sr. (an amateur motorcycle racer himself), introduced him to a minibike, and Edwards entered his first motocross race at the age of four. Over the next ten years, Edwards became one of the top-ranked junior motocross competitors in the US, winning dozens of races in the 50cc to 80cc categories in local, regional and national events.\n\nIn 1988 at the age of 14, Edwards stopped competing in motocross races, having become distracted by the normal demands of being a teenager. However, in 1990, Edwards and his father attended a motorcycle road race event in north Texas, and this inspired him to attempt road racing.\n\nIn 1991 Edwards began competing in amateur road-racing events locally, but rapidly progressed to national events. He was undefeated in every amateur event he entered that year, and won numerous national amateur titles. His performance was sufficiently impressive for him to be offered a sponsored ride with South West Motorsports, and Edwards turned professional just before the commencement of the 1992 season.\n\nIn his first professional season (1992), Edwards entered the AMA 250cc National Series. He won five of the nine races and the national title over second-place earner Kenny Roberts, Jr.. In 1993 and 1994 Edwards rode for Vance & Hines on a Yamaha in the AMA Superbike Championship, earning 6th and 5th place overall in those years.\n\nIn Edwards was offered a factory position with Yamaha in the Superbike World Championship. His results in were disappointing as Edwards struggled to adjust to the demands of competing in a global competition, and he missed the last two meetings after teammate Yasutomo Nagai perished in a crash at Assen. In he achieved a greatly improved sixth overall in the Superbike World championship.\n\nIn , Edwards managed several more victories for Honda (including leading teammate Aaron Slight home twice at Brands Hatch, giving Honda a rare Double-1-2) and ended the season in second overall position, behind champion Carl Fogarty. In , Edwards rode the new Honda VTR-1000 SP1/RC51 twin cylinder motorcycle to overall victory in the Superbike World Championship after Yamaha rider and points leader, Noriyuki Haga was disqualified for testing positive for a banned substance. Edwards came second to Ducati rider, Troy Bayliss in but reclaimed the title from Bayliss in in a dramatic fashion, clinching the championship in the final race of the season in Imola (Italy). Edwards also holds the record for the most points in a single season with 552 points in 2002 breaking the previous record of 489 points set by Carl Fogarty in 1999. Runner-up Troy Bayliss also broke the previous record with 541 points.\n\nAfter winning his 2nd Superbike World Championship Edwards moved to MotoGP in 2003. He rode for the greatly troubled Aprilia team on the RS Cube, and his only notable accomplishment in that otherwise dismal year was avoiding serious injury when his machine caught fire due to an incorrectly fitted fuel cap at Sachsenring. Yet Edwards, known in all motorcycle paddocks as a great bike tester, tried to no avail to help lift the struggling team.\n\n2004 saw Edwards riding for Telefonica Movistar Honda, and he achieved his first MotoGP podium position at Donington. Edwards finished the season in fifth overall position.\n\nIn 2005, Edwards moved to Gauloises Yamaha factory team as the teammate to the world champion Valentino Rossi. His best result for 2005 was a second position at Laguna Seca, behind compatriot Nicky Hayden. He finished the season fourth overall.\n\nFor 2006 Colin Edwards continued riding for the Camel Yamaha factory team on board the YZR-M1 with teammate and good friend Valentino Rossi in the MotoGP championship. The factory Yamaha team had a troubling start to their racing year with \"chatter\" problems and tire wear issues.\n\nThe factory team built a new chassis for the 2006 spec YZR-M1 to combat the aforementioned problems. Rossi took to the new chassis quickly and rode to victory at his home race of Mugello for the fifth consecutive time since 2001. Edwards did not have the time to \"gel\" with the new chassis early in the season, which resulted in him sticking with the older version for the Mugello race. He finished 12th.\n\nAt Assen he took the lead at the start, and led until Nicky Hayden passed him on the penultimate lap. He caught back up to his countryman on the last lap, and managed to pass him a few corners from the end. When Hayden attempted to pass him again in the final chicane, Edwards ran across the AstroTurf and lost control of his bike, which briefly continued on without him. He remounted to finish 13th. Hayden, who ran across the gravel on the final chicane himself, managed to keep control of his bike and won the race. At his home race, the Red Bull U.S. Grand Prix, Edwards finished ninth suffering tire problems in the scorching heat like his teammate Valentino Rossi. At Estoril he qualified second and finished fourth in one of his most competitive showings of the season.\n\n2007 brought great prospects early on. Colin entered his second of a two-year deal with Yamaha factory team, now known as Fiat Yamaha riding the new Yamaha YZR-M1 800cc. Yet after starting second on the grid in Istanbul, a first lap crash caused by Olivier Jacque took him out. At Le Mans Colin took pole position, but made a slow start and gambled on switching to wet tyres in damp conditions. He did this too early, and by the time it was wet enough his tyres had shredded, forcing him to pit again and finish at the back of the field.\n\nFiat Yamaha was having problems with the M1 and the Michelin tires, Edwards along with teammate Valentino Rossi both struggled to find competitive set up nearly the entire season to run up front. Edwards best result of the season was 2nd (equaling his career best in MotoGP) at the wet British Grand Prix at Donington Park.\n\nFor the 2008 season, Colin Edwards continued in MotoGP, this time for the satellite Tech 3 Yamaha team alongside fellow Superbike World Champion James Toseland. A series of solid performances left him 5th in the overall standings after nine rounds, never qualifying lower than 6th on the grid and finishing on the podium twice. After qualifying 6th for round 9 at Assen, he was delayed by Rossi's early crash and was in next to last place at the end of the first lap (in front of only Rossi, who was able to rejoin the race), however he then fought back to snatch 3rd from Nicky Hayden at the final corner after Hayden ran out of fuel, gaining a measure of revenge for the 2006 race at the track. Colin Edwards results started to suffer after a crash in Germany. In the next four races Edwards failed to break the top ten and his best result since the podium at Assen was a sixth place at the final round of the season at Valencia.\n\nEdwards confirmed that he had signed for Tech 3 for yet another season. \"It is no secret that I had agreed with Yamaha to finish my MotoGP career at the end of 2008 and continue my racing career with them in America, but as soon as I began working with the Tech 3 team I instantly formed a great relationship with my guys.\"\nTherefore, Edwards will once again be riding for Tech 3 Yamaha in 2009 as he searches for his first MotoGP victory.\n\nEdwards once again demonstrated consistent form in the 2009 MotoGP season, establishing himself as the strongest satellite rider in the championship. He secured a second-place finish in the British Grand Prix at Donington Park.\n\nAfter being caught in a crash at the San Marino Grand Prix, Edwards directed typically outspoken criticism towards Alex de Angelis, claiming: \"We are in Italy and occasionally you have to deal with an Italian rider who wants to be a hero and today that was De Angelis. De Angelis is the guy who needed to be wearing Valentino’s donkey helmet,\" in reference to a special edition helmet being worn by Valentino Rossi.\n\nOn October 1, 2009 Edwards announced that he had signed a one-year contract extension that would see him ride for Tech 3 Yamaha in the season.

Nine days later, and in his first race since injury, Edwards took a third-place finish at the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, having been promoted to a podium placing after accidents for Jorge Lorenzo and Marco Simoncelli. It was his first podium finish since a second-place result at the 2009 British Grand Prix at Donington Park. \n\nOn October 23, along with Valentino Rossi, Edwards was involved in the accident that killed Marco Simoncelli at the Malaysian Grand Prix, injuring his left shoulder and ending his season. Josh Hayes replaced him for Valencia.\n\nOn September 3, 2011, Edwards announced that he would leave the Tech 3 team, to ride as the single entry for NGM Mobile Forward Racing in . The team was making their re-entry to the premier class under the new Claiming Rule Teams regulations with a Suter chassis powered by a BMW engine.\n\nRemaining with Forward Racing for 2013, Edwards was partnered with rookie Claudio Corti on FTR-Kawasaki machinery.\n\nEdwards again remained with Forward Racing for 2014, this time partnering Aleix Espargaró on Yamaha-based machines. At a press conference prior to the 2014 Motorcycle Grand Prix of the Americas, Edwards announced that the 2014 season will be his final MotoGP season, citing the struggle to adapt to a different riding style. It was stated after the Indianapolis round, that he would not compete in the second half of the season, and was replaced by Alex de Angelis. During commentary for the British MotoGP round at Silverstone on August 31, 2014, Edwards revealed he will be a test rider for Yamaha and Michelin for the next two years.\n\nIn 1996, Edwards teamed with Noriyuki Haga to claim victory in the Suzuka 8 Hours endurance race riding a Yamaha, his first international victory. Edwards won the 8 Hours two more times: in 2001 with Valentino Rossi, and in 2002 with the late Daijiro Kato, both times with Honda.\n\nEdwards has twice represented the United States in the Michelin Race of Champions Nation's Cup, first in 2000 and again in 2002 when the US team won the event. The competition involves a national team that includes an automobile racer, a rally/off-road driver and a motorcycle racer. The 2002 US team included former off-road racer and NASCAR rookie Jimmie Johnson as the rally driver, and four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon in the automobile category.\n\nFollowing the end of his racing career, Edwards joined British MotoGP broadcaster BT Sport in 2016 as a pundit in their pre- and post-race programming.\n\nThe Colin Edwards Texas Tornado Boot Camp or TTBC is a world class motorcycle training facility built on a plot of land near Lake Conroe.

{"id": "2224082", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2224082", "title": "Amazing Blondel", "text": "Amazing Blondel\n\nAmazing Blondel are an English acoustic progressive folk band, containing Eddie Baird, John Gladwin, and Terry Wincott. They released a number of LPs for Island Records in the early 1970s. They are sometimes categorised as psychedelic folk or as medieval folk rock, but their music was much more a reinvention of Renaissance music, based around the use of period instruments such as lutes and recorders.\n\nJohn Gladwin (guitar and vocals) and Terrance (Terry) Wincott (guitar and vocals) formed a band called The Dimples along with Stuart Smith (drums) and Johnny Jackson (bass guitar). Signed to the Decca label they recorded a single, the \"A\" side \"Love of a Lifetime\" and the \"B\" side written by John Gladwin titled \"My Heart is Tied to You\". The record did not chart, although more recently the B-side has become popular on the Northern soul scene.\nFollowing the break up of The Dimples John and Terry formed a loud \"electric\" band called Methuselah. However, at some point in Methuselah concerts, the duo would play an acoustic number together: they found that this went down well with the audiences and allowed them to bring out more of the subtlety of their singing and instrumental work. They left Methuselah in 1969 and began working on their own acoustic material.\n\nInitially their material was derived from folk music, in line with many of the other performers of the time. However, they began to develop their own musical idiom, influenced, at one extreme, by the early music revivalists such as David Munrow, and the other extreme, by their childhood memories of the \"Robin Hood\" TV series, with its pseudo-mediaeval soundtrack by Elton Hayes.\n\nThe band was named after Blondel de Nesle, the musician in the court of Richard I. According to legend, when Richard was held prisoner, Blondel travelled through central Europe, singing at every castle to locate the King and assist his escape. This name for the band was suggested by a chef, Eugene McCoy, who listened to some of their songs and commented: \"Oh, very Blondel!\" and they began to use that name. They were then advised to add an adjective (in line, for example, with The Incredible String Band) and so they became \"Amazing Blondel\".\n\nTheir first album \"The Amazing Blondel\" (also called \"Amazing Blondel and a Few Faces,\") was recorded in 1969 and released by Bell Records. It was directed by session guitarist Big Jim Sullivan. At about this time, Eddie Baird (who had known the other members at school) joined the band. On 19 September 1970 they were one of the bands to play at the first Glastonbury Festival. Following what Baird described as \"a disastrous 'showbiz' record signing\", Amazing Blondel were introduced, by members of the band Free, to Chris Blackwell of Island Records and Artists. Blackwell signed them up to Island, for whom they recorded their albums \"Evensong\", \"Fantasia Lindum\" and \"England\". \n\nIn Baird's words (in a 2003 interview) the band \"adored recording\". They recorded the Island albums in the company's Basing Street Studios which, at that time, was the source of some of the most innovative independent music in Britain.\n\nThey toured widely, both in their own concerts and as a support act for bands such as Genesis, Procol Harum and Steeleye Span. On stage, they aimed at technical precision of the music and versatility of instrumentation (with most concerts involving the use of some forty instruments) interspersed with banter and bawdy humour. However, there was a conflict between their managers' desires to organise ever more demanding tour schedules and the band's own wish to spend more time writing material and working in the studio. In the end, this led to the departure of John Gladwin (who had written most of their material) from the band in 1973, and the remaining two members decided to continue as a duo. In this new format, they went on to record several more albums, with Baird now writing the bulk of the material. The first of these, \"Blondel\", was their final release for Island. They were next signed to Dick James' DJM label, where they recorded three albums, \"Mulgrave Street\", \"Inspiration\" and \"Bad Dreams\". They gradually modernized and electrified their sound. These albums featured a number of guest musicians, including Steve Winwood and Paul Kossoff. There is a mistaken belief that, during this period, they shortened the band name to Blondel. This is probably caused by the title of the final Island album, and the front cover of \"Mulgrave Street\", which gives the short version of the name. But the full name is given on the back and on the front of the next two albums. The final release in the 1970s was a live album. \n\nBy the end of the 1970s, with disco being the largest selling music genre and with folk losing popularity, Baird and Wincott stopped performing under the Amazing Blondel name. John Gladwin reinherited the name and began to tour universities with bandmates, and former session players for the original Amazing Blondel; Adrian Hopkins and Paul Empson. This line-up had originally been billed as \"John David Gladwin's Englishe Musicke\". \n\nThe original band reformed in 1997 and produced a new album \"Restoration\". They have since played at venues across Europe in the period 1997–2000. As of 2005, Terry Wincott had a successful heart bypass operation, which curtailed the band's plans for future concerts.\n\nIn 2005, Eddie Baird played two concerts in a duo with acoustic guitarist and singer songwriter Julie Ellison and is currently working on a collaboration with Darryl Ebbatson, called \"Ebbatson Baird\".\n\nJohn David Gladwin and Edward Baird were born and brought up in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire: Terence Alan Wincott was born in Hampshire but moved to Scunthorpe at an early age.\n\nThe members of the band were all accomplished musicians. Gladwin sang and played twelve-string guitar, lute, double bass, theorbo, cittern, tabor and tubular bells. Wincott sang and played 6 string guitar, harmonium, recorders, flute, ocarina, congas, crumhorn, pipe organ, tabor, harpsichord, piano, mellotron, bongos and assorted percussion. Baird sang and played lute, glockenspiel, cittern, dulcimer, twelve string guitar and percussion.\n\nThe style of their music is difficult to categorise. Most of it was composed by themselves, but was based on the form and structure of Renaissance music, featuring, for example, pavanes, galliards and madrigals. It is sometimes categorised as psychedelic folk but would probably have been disowned by both the psychedelic community and the folk community, whilst being instantly recognisable to students of early music. Terry Wincott described it as \"pseudo-Elizabethan/Classical acoustic music sung with British accents\". Eddie Baird is quoted as saying \"People used to ask us, How would you describe your music? Well, there was no point asking us, we didn't have a clue.\"\n\nTheir music has been compared with that of Gryphon and Pentangle: however, Amazing Blondel did not embrace the rock influences of the former nor the folk and jazz influences of the latter. They have also been likened to Jethro Tull.\n\nThe band employed a wide range of instruments (see above) but, central to their sound was their use of the lute and recorders. \n\nWhen touring, the lutes proved to be quite difficult instruments for stage performance (in terms of amplification and tuning) and, in 1971, the band commissioned the construction of two 7-string guitars, which could be played in lute tuning. The design and construction of these instruments was undertaken by David Rubio who made classical guitars, lutes, and other early instruments for classical players, including Julian Bream and John Williams.\n\nGladwin's instrument was designed to have slightly more of a bass sound, as it was used mainly as an accompaniment instrument, whereas Baird's had a little bit more treble emphasis, to allow his melodic playing in the higher register to predominate. The two instruments were individually successful and also blended well together. They also proved to be stable (from a tuning point of view) for stage performance. The guitars were fitted with internal microphones to simplify amplification.\n\n\n"}

He studied double bass in high school with his music theory teacher and band director, Walter Dyett. He was a member of Chicago Youth Symphony Orchestras (then known as the Youth Orchestra of Greater Chicago) and played in the orchestra's first performance at Chicago's Orchestra Hall on November 14, 1947. After high school, he studied double bass with Rudolf Fahsbender of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra while attending VanderCook College of Music.\n\nAfter college, Davis performed in dance bands. The connections he made led him to pianist Don Shirley. In 1954 he and Shirley moved to New York City and performed together until 1956, when Davis began playing with the Sauter-Finegan Orchestra. In 1957, he became part of Sarah Vaughan's rhythm section, touring and recording with her until 1960.\n\nDuring the 1960s, Davis was in demand in a variety of musical circles.

{"id": "2224123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2224123", "title": "Lake Voulismeni", "text": "Lake Voulismeni\n\nLake Voulismeni (Greek: Λίμνη Βουλισμένη, \"Límni Voulisméni\") is a former sweetwater small lake, later connected to the sea, located at the centre of the town of Agios Nikolaos on the Greek island of Crete. It has a circular shape of a diameter of 137 m and depth 48.8m. The locals refer to it as simply \"the lake\". The lake is connected to the harbour of the town by a channel dug by the French army in 1907. A panoramic view of the lake can be seen from a small park situated above it.\n\nAccording to legend, the goddess Athena bathed in it. Every year at midnight turning to Orthodox Christian Easter day, the majority of the population of the town gathers around the lake to celebrate with fireworks, and firecrackers thrown by the people attending that highlight event.\n\nThe rocks at the lake are limestone breccias, the result of undersea landslides coming down from the mountains to the north-west of the town.\n\nA normal fault which cuts right through the town in a roughly NNE to SSW direction passes directly through the north-western side of the lake, the cliff at the lake is the scarp slope of this fault. Elsewhere in the town the fault was later buried by subsequent underwater landslides. An underground stream that was cut by this fault created a solution sinkhole and a small cave following the disappearance of the overlying sea during the Messinian Salinity Crisis. After only a few hundred thousand years the small cave, dissolved out of the unstable and structurally weak breccia, collapsed creating a deep hole. The destabilised breccia at the top of this hole subsided into the hole creating a deep funnel-shaped sinkhole which was subsequently filled with freshwater by the still running spring. The creation of the Mediterranean Sea during the Zanclean Flood left a deep, spring-fed, freshwater lake that overflowed via a small stream into the nearby sea.\n\nIn 1852 Captain Thomas Spratt surveyed eastern Crete on behalf of the Royal Navy and recorded the lake as being \"'...a small circular pool of brackish water\"' and \"'...having a small stream opening out of it into the sea\"', clear evidence that the spring was still flowing at that time. He also measured the depth of the lake as 210 feet (64m) and it is this figure that is used in almost all publications and writings about the lake today. In September 2000 the geology department of the University of Athens conducted a detailed underwater survey of the lake, they found its maximum depth to be only 48.8m. The results of this survey appear not to have been widely publicised outside the geological community.\n\nOn 12 October 1856 a massive earthquake occurred in the sea off Crete with an epicentre only 40km from the lake. Although its magnitude was not recorded it was listed as grade XI on the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale, one grade down from the maximum possible. This earthquake was most likely responsible for the blocking or diversion of the freshwater spring leading to the later stagnation of the lake and the collapse of the western corner of the lake which reduced the lake depth from the 64m measured by Thomas Spratt to the 48.8m today.\n\nOnce the spring had stopped flowing the lake soon became stagnant, it was known locally as Vromolimni; 'the stinky lake'. The obvious solution was to dig a channel to the nearby sea to allow the denser seawater to flush away the stagnant freshwater and remove the source of the smell.\n\nThe first channel connecting the lake to the sea was dug by Kostas Adosides Pasha, the Ottoman governor of Lasithi at the time, between 1867 and 1870. Although this channel probably did flush away the smelly stagnant water there is evidence that around 10 years later the lake surface had again evaporated to about 6 metres below sea level and was thus likely to be stagnant again. This evidence is in a photograph of the port and the town taken 'just before 1880' where a flat-topped and rocky peninsula can be seen standing about 4 metres above the lake surface. This peninsula is clearly visible in the University of Athens underwater lake survey, but in here it is 2 metres below the lake surface. This can only mean that by 1880 the channel had become blocked, probably because the near vertical sides in the structurally weak limestone breccia rocks partially collapsed, undercut by the water flowing in the channel.\n\nBetween 1898 and 1913 the French army were stationed in Lasithi as one of the 'Great Powers' guaranteeing Cretan independence after the overthrow of Ottoman control in 1898 and before union with Greece in 1913. They are known to have cut the Poros channel at the southern end of Spinalonga Lagoon in 1898. A 1903 pictorial postcard of Agios Nikolaos\nclearly shows the modern channel, properly reinforced with stone walls to prevent further erosion and collapse, and it's very likely that this work was done by the French army around the turn of the century. It has been suggested that this was done in 1907 but the 1903 postcard makes that impossible, perhaps 1907 was a misreading of 1902? That date would certainly fit.\n\nA local urban myth is that the lake is bottomless and the crater of an extinct volcano. That notion is most likely based on its impressively high depth compared to its width (48.8m depth and only 134m width) or/and on locals noticing disturbances at the surface or also the level of the water during the 1956 Amorgos earthquake (which was wrongly attributed to an eruption of Santorini). Because of the latter, many assume a possible (and incorrect) geological relation of the two locations.\nThe complete absence of igneous rocks anywhere near the lake precludes its being a volcano, the supposed connection with Santorini can also be dismissed for the same reason. \n\n"}

Hyde and Rock formed the band in 1978, cheekily naming it after the U.S. radio scandal of the '50s. Rock would also start engineering and producing at Little Mountain Sound in Vancouver, where Payola$ relocated from Langford, British Columbia.\n\nThe band's major label EP, \"Introducing Payola$,\" was released on A&M in 1980. The band had made a few DIY recordings in 1979 before signing to A&M. Their other A&M releases were 1981's \"In a Place Like This\", 1982's \"No Stranger to Danger\" and 1983's \"Hammer on a Drum\".\n\nIn 1985, Hyde was a credited co-writer of the No. 1 Canadian charity single \"Tears Are Not Enough\" by Northern Lights. He also sang in the song's chorus. For \"Here's the World for Ya\" (1985), the band changed its name to Paul Hyde and the Payolas, but disappointing sales resulted in their being dropped by the label. The team resigned with Capitol/EMI and put out one album, \"Under the Volcano\" (1987), as Rock And Hyde.\n\nThese attempts to increase radio play in the U.S. by changing their band name met with limited success, although they gave Hyde his only two US Hot 100 entries. Still, Rock and Hyde went their separate ways in 1988: Hyde became a solo artist, and Rock an extremely successful hard rock/metal producer (his clients included Metallica), and part of the short-lived band Rockhead.\n\nIn 1988, with Murray McLauchlan and Tom Cochrane, Hyde recorded a benefit single and video for UNICEF called \"Let the Good Guys Win\". In 1989, Hyde's solo single \"America is Sexy\" reached No. 28 on the RPM 100 Singles chart of 23–28 October.\n\nIn December 1988, the song was ranked as No. 23 of the top 25 Cancon songs of the year. The single was from Hyde's debut solo album, \"Turtle Island\", which appeared on the RPM Top 100 Albums chart in 1989. Some of the album's other songs were co-written with his first wife, Myriam Nelson.\n\nDespite the respectable chart success of the song, there was to be an eleven-year gap between \"Turtle Island\" and Hyde's next major label album. During this interval, he completed an album for the small Broken Records label: \"Love and the Great Depression\" was released in 1996. The album escaped the notice of anyone not specifically looking for it. A prominent figure in Canadian pop in the 1980s, Hyde had become obscure.\n\nAlways remaining good friends with Hyde, Rock generously gave of his time to produce Hyde's 2000 EMI Music Canada album, \"Living off the Radar\", which included some songs that the two co-wrote for the project. The response to the album proved the truth of its name, although singles \"I Loved You Before I Met You\" (co-written with Craig Northey) and \"The Snake\" (co-written with Rock) received some airplay. Again without a major label contract, in 2002 Hyde released \"The Big Book of Sad Songs, Volume 1\" on the small Bongo Beat label. A stripped-down production that clocked in at barely over 30 minutes, the album nevertheless demonstrated the enduring craftsmanship of its songwriter.\n\nHyde and Rock reunited again as Payola$ in 2003 for a gig in Vancouver, after which they decided to write more material together. Linus Entertainment released a Payola$ Live DVD in 2005.\n\nBest known for such hits as \"China Boys,\" \"Eyes Of A Stranger\" and \"Where is This Love?\", Payola$ played a special performance at EMI's post-Juno Award party April 1, 2007, in Saskatoon after Rock—who now lives in Hawaii, where he has a recording studio—was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame at the telecast. The line-up included the final 1980s configuration of band personnel, drummer Chris Taylor (joined 1982) and bassist Alexander \"A-train\" Boynton (joined circa 1985).\n\nThe Payola$ became active again as recording artists when the long-time musical partners released a seven-track CD EP, \"Langford (Part One)\", on July 17, 2007, through EMI Music Canada. Named for the Victoria, British Columbia suburb where Hyde and Rock met, the EP has a cover featuring Belmont Secondary School in Langford, which they attended together.\n\nThe Payola$ ceased operation in 2008. Rock and Hyde have not announced whether they will be working together again or whether they will complete the full album that was supposed to follow their 2007 CD EP \"Langford (Part One)\".\n\nHyde released a second album for Bongo Beat on October 20, 2009, called \"Peace Sign\". In January 2018, Hyde released a third album for Bongo Beat called \"No Gods, Just Men\", which is currently a digital-only release.\n\n\nPaul has three children with ex-wife Myriam Nelson. His son, David Nelson, is a Vancouver-based rapper and lyricist. His twin daughters Elizabeth and Danielle are the Vancouver-based singing duo \"Dani and Lizzy\".\n"}

The head is brown with a concealed yellow crown patch, white supercilium and dusky eye mask. The upperparts are brown with darker brown streaks on the back, rufous and white edges on the wings, and wide chestnut edges on the rump and tail. The underparts are yellowish-white streaked with brown.\nSexes are similar, but immature birds are brown where the adult is black. \"M. m. solitarius\" has black rather than brown streaking above and below. The streaked flycatcher is a conspicuous bird, with a noisy \"sqEEE-zip\" call.\n\nIt is very similar in appearance to the less widespread sulphur-bellied flycatcher. The streaked flycatcher has a heavier bill, lighter yellow belly, pink basal half of the lower mandible and creamy (not white) superciliary.\nThis species breeds from eastern Mexico, Trinidad and Tobago south to Bolivia and Argentina. The southern subspecies \"M. m. solitarius\" migrates to Venezuela and the Guianas from March to September during the austral winter. It is found at the edges of forests and cocoa plantations. Common across its wide range, this species is not considered threatened by the IUCN.\n\nStreaked flycatchers eat a range of food items, mostly large insects, but also lizards and berries. It perches on a high watchpoint from which it sallies forth to catch insects in mid-flight or off plants using a range of aerobatic maneuvers, and occasionally gleans prey from the vegetation. The wintering southern migrants seem to include a considerable amount of fruit in their diet, for example those of Tamanqueiro (\"Alchornea glandulosa\") which they sometimes eat in quantity; fruit are typically ripped off in mid-hover. It occasionally follows mixed-species feeding flocks, pouncing from up in the trees on prey flushed by birds in the undergrowth.\n\nThe nest is an open cup of twigs and grasses placed in a tree hollow or sometimes a bromeliad. The female builds the nest and incubates the typical clutch of two or three creamy-white eggs, which are marked with red-brown spots, for 16–17 days to hatching. Both sexes feed the chicks, which fledge in a further 18–21 days.\n\n\n"}

The chase resulted in the driver, 20-year-old Jesse Kelly, crashing the stolen vehicle into a tree and killing his two passengers, 17-year-old Dylan Raywood and 19-year-old Matthew Robertson. Certain circumstances around the riots including the fatal police pursuit in a low-income area were seen to be a repeat of the riots that took place in Redfern, New South Wales during the previous year.\n\nThe accident sparked protests and accusations of police impropriety after Kelly's aunt Deborah falsely claimed police had rammed the car prior to the crash. Kelly eventually adopted the accusation, which was untrue.\nNew South Wales state Premier Bob Carr mobilised hundreds of police, including heavily armed riot squads into the area. The violence that followed lasted four nights, involving at least 300 residents clashing with police. The rioters hurled rocks, bottles, bricks, petrol bombs, and set cars alight, injuring several officers. During a Parliamentary inquiry nine months later, NSW Police Commissioner Ken Moroney stated that the violence during the incident was not a riot when compared to incidents in Los Angeles or Paris, referring to the distinction between \"disturbance\" and \"riot\" as defined by Los Angeles Police Department police chief Bill Bratton, who had been visiting Australia at the time of the disturbances.\n\nThe police were criticised at the time for not acting to quell the disturbances quickly enough, with some arguing the riots could have been ended in their first day had a more aggressive stance been adopted. The so-called 'soft' approach by police was put down to downsizing and a lack of training within the NSW Police Force that inhibited their ability to contain the ringleaders effectively. The police eventually made 55 arrests, including that of Jesse Kelly, who had fled the scene of the fatal car crash which preceded the riots.\n\nThe suburb of Macquarie Fields suffered from a high unemployment rate of 11.3 percent, more than twice the National average. Of its 4,600 homes, 1,500 are housing commission projects and home to low-income and disadvantaged families. Criticisms have been made about this controversial cul de sac style urban planning that left many residents with very little privacy.\n\nIn October 2006, Jesse Kelly was formally charged after admitting two counts of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning death and was sentenced to 5 years jail. In the same month a coronial inquiry officially cleared New South Wales Police of any responsibility for the riot. His aunt Deborah Kelly, who started the rumors that sparked the riots, was charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice and with concealing a serious indictable offence.\n\n"}

Formed in 1986, the group initially consisted of six players, while it is currently five viols. Its repertoire consists primarily of music of the Renaissance period, in particular that of Elizabethan and Jacobean England, arrangements of the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, and contemporary music written for them.\n\nThe group has toured all over the world, with tours of Japan and the United States, and three visits to Russia, the first in 1989, when it was still a part of the Soviet Union. They initiated a series of courses for voices and viols on the Greek island of Evvia with Michael Chance, and have also been invited twice to teach on the annual Conclave of the Viola da Gamba Society of America. It currently teaches each year in the first week of Dartington International Summer School.\n\nIn addition to its performances of earlier music, Fretwork has been active in commissioning new works for viol consort. Its 1997 recording \"Sit Fast\" includes new works by such composers as Gavin Bryars, Tan Dun, and Elvis Costello. It has also commissioned music from Sir John Tavener, Michael Nyman, Alexander Goehr, George Benjamin, Duncan Druce, Fabrice Fitch, Gavin Bryars, Barry Guy, Poul Ruders, Simon Bainbridge, Ivan Moody, John Woolrich, Thea Musgrave, Peter Sculthorpe, Sally Beamish, Andrew Keeling and Orlando Gough.\n\nFretwork has recorded a series of discs for Virgin Classics and Harmonia Mundi USA, but currently records for Signum Records. Recent discs include 'Bach's Goldberg Variations arranged for viols by Richard Boothby and The World Encompassed, with Simon Callow.\n\nIn 2007 they recorded \"Birds on Fire: Jewish Music for Viols\" which presents some of the music composed by Italian-Jewish composers from the Bassano & Lupo families, who came to England to work at the court of Henry VIII in 1540. It also includes music by Salamone Rossi and Leonora Duarte. Finally it includes the first recording of 'Birds on Fire' itself, a three-part piece by Orlando Gough written for Fretwork in 2001. This work is based on the novel by Aaron Appelfeld \"Badenheim 1939\", telling the story of a group of Jews who holiday in a resort near Vienna in the spring of 1939. The town gradually becomes a ghetto, and the band of musicians gradually rediscover their Jewish roots to break out from the Vienese schmalz to play klezmer tunes.\n\nTheir second recording of the complete Fantazias by Henry Purcell, including the two in Nomines, for HMU (Harmonia Mundi USA) was selected as Editor's Choice in \"Classic FM Magazine\"; where Fretwork's playing was described as \"all one could wish for\"; and it won the Gramophone Award on the Baroque Instrumental section 2009.\n\nIn 2008, they recorded two tracks on Ryuichi Sakamoto's album \"Out of Noise\".\n\nFretwork was featured on the soundtracks of two Jim Jarmusch movies, \"Coffee and Cigarettes\" (2003) and \"Broken Flowers\" (2005). Other filmtracks include \"The Da Vinci Code\", \"Kingdom of Heaven\", \"The Crucible\", \"La Fille d'Artagnant\" and many others. It has also recorded for Robbie Williams (Supreme) and Loreena McKennitt (for the album \"An Ancient Muse\").\n\nIn March 2011, Richard Campbell committed suicide, losing his battle against a melancholy he had been fighting for years. His loss is keenly felt by all his colleagues.\n\nIn 2016 they celebrated their 30 years of activity with a concert in London's Kings Place, with guest players and singers, ending the concert with an arrangement of 'Because' by Lennon & McCartney.\n\nSince 2017 they have been recording for Signum Classics, and have released three CDs on this label: The World Encompassed, In Chains of Gold and John Jenkins Four-part Consort music. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2224144", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2224144", "title": "Ultimate Nullifier", "text": "Ultimate Nullifier\n\nThe Ultimate Nullifier is a fictional device of immense power appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The device made its first appearance in \"Fantastic Four\" volume 1, issue #50 (May 1966), in which Johnny Storm retrieves it from the home of Galactus—as directed by Uatu the Watcher—for the Fantastic Four to employ against the threat of Galactus himself. The Nullifier appears as a small, hand-held metallic device with no apparent functionality. When first introduced in 1966 it was described as the only known weapon in the universe capable of inspiring fear in Galactus.\n\nIn its first appearance, Reed Richards threatens the use of the Ultimate Nullifier as a last-ditch effort to stop Galactus from destroying Earth as Human Torch recovered it from the base of Galactus with the help of Uatu the Watcher. Faced with the prospect of dying by Richards' activation of the Nullifier, Galactus withdraws.\n\nThe Nullifier later appears in The Infinity War. Quasar tries to use it in an attempt to destroy the Magus, who had acquired the collective power of five cosmic cubes and a gauntlet containing 5 of the 6 Infinity Gems. The Reality Gem was replaced in this instance with a duplicate created by Thanos. Although Quasar tried to use the weapon on Magus, Quasar's attack gets redirected by the incomplete Infinity Gauntlet, temporarily nullifying Quasar in the process.\n\nThe Ultimate Nullifier is generally kept within Galactus' Worldship, Taa II, though at times Galactus has been known to carry it aboard his spherical starship. In the rare instances that the Nullifier gets stolen or kept in other locales, such as the Fantastic Four's headquarters, the Nullifier inevitably returns to Galactus' possession. In the Abraxas saga Galactus demonstrates his ability to recall the Nullifier to himself at will. In conjunction, he stated it to be \"as much a part of me as my heart itself.\" In the 2006 edition of \"Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe\", Marvel Comics included a profile of the 'Ultimate Nullifier' which, using technobabble, described the device to be of \"unknown origins\" within the context of the fictional Marvel Universe.\n\nDuring the \"Original Sin\" storyline, an evolved Mindless One had the Ultimate Nullifier in its possession and used it on itself to put it out of its misery despite Thing trying to talk it down. By this time, Nick Fury and the Avengers arrive where Captain America wants the Ultimate Nullifier left alone until it is contained.\n\nThe Ultimate Nullifier has been described as \"the universe's most devastating weapon\". As such, the Ultimate Nullifier has the ability to completely eliminate any target the wielder chooses, along with the user if his or her mind is not focused enough. In the hands of a being with an extremely powerful mind, the Ultimate Nullifier can destroy entire timelines from beginning to end or even erase (and paradoxically recreate) the entire infinite Marvel multiverse.\n\nIn the \"Earth X\" trilogy, Universe X in particular, the Ultimate Nullifier is one of the cosmic objects Captain Marvel, resurrected as a child, gathers to create Paradise. Later, it is used against Death after Marvel's spiritual counterpart, Mar-Vell, reveals to Thanos how Death has manipulated him in the past and gives the Ultimate Nullifier to him. Thanos annihilates Death and removes her from power, paving the way for the new paradise. However, as an unforeseen consequence, it leaves those still living unable to die, forcing the remaining heroes on Earth to resurrect Jude The Entropic Man as a means for dying.\n\nDuring the JLA/Avengers crossover (published between Sep 2003 - Mar 2004), the JLA and the Avengers go after twelve items of power, six from each universe. The Grandmaster approaches the League and tells them the Ultimate Nullifier is one of the great six items of power of the Marvel Universe, along with the Infinity Gems, the Casket of Ancient Winters, the Wand of Watoomb, the Evil Eye of Avalon and the Cosmic Cube. The first item the League collects is the Ultimate Nullifier. The Martian Manhunter examines it, but it threatens to overwhelm his mind, and he starts to lose control of his shape due to the immense power felt while probing the Nullifier, stating the item alone could destroy an entire universe.\n\nIn Marvel Adventures: The Avengers #26, Spider-Man theorizes that the Nullifier does not actually destroy things, or it would be called an \"Ultimate Annihilator.\" He believes that it instead alters the laws of probability, changing the universe so that \"everything has an equal likelihood of affecting everything else.\" The theory turns out to be right when Spider-Man activates the Nullifier in an attempt to stop Galactus.\n\nDuring the \"Ultimate Extinction\" storyline in the Ultimate Marvel universe, Reed Richards created a massively up-sized, towering version of the very same portal device that he had previously designed on two other occasions to connect to the N-Zone. This weapon unleashed the tremendous energies of an alternate universe's Big Bang at Gah-Lak-Tus, destroying 20% of its mass and driving it off. This weapon is referred to as \"the Nevada Gun\", and is activated by triggering a Big Bang in an infant universe, and channeling that energy into a giant beam of destruction.\n\nIn \"What If?\" vol. 1 #32 'What If The Avengers Had Become Pawns of Korvac?,' Korvac sends a recreated and mind-controlled Captain America to the worldship of Galactus to steal the Nullifier and then use it on Galactus. In doing so Captain America destroys both Galactus and himself. It is explained that that is the secret of the Nullifier: that it nullifies both target and wielder. The story ends with a frustrated and angry Korvac having absorbed almost all the most powerful beings in the universe, but still unable to achieve complete domination. Saying \"I am strong, stronger than any being in the universe... but not stronger than every being in the universe,\" in a fatalistic rage, he absorbs the energy of every living being on Earth and grows to planetary size. He bonds with the spirit of Eternity, and uses the Nullifer against an armada of the sentient races of universe who have banded together to stop him. Not physically present at the destruction of Galactus, Korvac is potentially unaware of how the Nullifier works, and destroys all of reality, and himself, in the confrontation. Even in this all-encompassing use of the device, it survives the destruction of all else.\n\nSeveral issues later, in issue #43 of the same volume of the series, Doctor Strange, the Phoenix, and The Silver Surfer—who had all been thrown entirely out of the local universe at an earlier point by Korvac and thus were spared its destruction—were stopped by the \"ghost\" of Eternity from attempting to use the Ultimate Nullifier on the void once they separately found their way back to that alternate universe and located the device—the only remaining object in all of the void. The entity implied that the three survivors of the destroyed universe were correct in their deduction that if they used the device on the same region that it had previously nullified, that the resulting action would \"undo\" the previous nullification event and restore the universe; instead of restoring the universe, Eternity's spirit wanted the empty expanse to forever serve as a warning to others that might try to use the Nullifier.\n\nIn the \"Age of Ultron\" storyline, the Ultimate Nullifer is shown stored at Nick Fury's secret base in the Savage Land. When its use is discussed, Iron Man claims that he will not entertain the thought.\n\n\n\n"}

It is one of several United States Government efforts to develop plasma-based projectiles. The first computer simulations occurred in 1990, and its first published experiment appeared on August 1, 1993.\n\nThe first MARAUDER experiment was motivated by RACE, or the Ring Accelerator Experiment, which took place in 1991 at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The ultimate goal of the MARAUDER program was to accelerate highly dense toroids containing plasma to high speeds. Such a system could be used for “hypervelocity projectiles,” x-ray production, and electrical power amplification. The stated goals of the program included studying the “formation, compression, and acceleration of magnetized plasma rings.”\n\nSpecifically, the objective of the program was the acceleration of a toroid of 0.5-2.0 mg plasma to a kinetic energy level on the order of megajoules using a 5-10 MJ coaxial gun design.\n\nIn 1993, the Phillips Laboratory developed a coaxial plasma gun capable of accelerating 1–2 mg of plasma by up to 10g in a toroid of 1 meter in diameter. The toroids are similar to spheromaks, but differ in that an inner conductor is used to accelerate the plasma and that confinement behavior results from interactions of the toroid with its surrounding atmosphere. It utilized the Shiva Star capacitor bank to satisfy the large energy requirements that were needed.\n\nThe plasma projectiles would be shot at a speed expected to be 3000 km/s in 1995 and 10,000 km/s (3% of the speed of light) by 2000. A shot has the energy of 5 pounds of TNT exploding. Doughnut-shaped rings of plasma and balls of lightning exploded with devastating thermal and mechanical effects when hitting their target and produced pulse of electromagnetic radiation that could scramble electronics, the energy would shower the interior of the target with high-energy x-rays that would potentially destroy the electronics inside.\n\nAs of 1993, the project appeared to be in the early experimental stages. The weapon was able to produce doughnut-shaped rings of plasma and balls of lightning that exploded with devastating thermal and mechanical effects when hitting their target and produced pulse of electromagnetic radiation that could scramble electronics. The project's initial success led to it becoming classified, and only a few references to MARAUDER appeared after 1993. No information about the fate of the project has been published after 1995.\n\n\n"}

The band takes its name from the sobriquet of Venice under the Doges, which was regarded as \"The Most Serene Republic of Venice\".\n\n\nPast members:\n\nThe roots of the band were planted in 2003 when Ryan Lenssen and Adrian Jewett formed Thee Oneironauts (O-nye-rawn-nauts). The pair recorded and self-released an EP entitled \"Night of the Lawnchairs\" on the GROK Studios imprint, which had also released Lenssen's concept band \"Rushing To Redlights\". The Oneironauts grew to trio status with the addition of Nick Greaves on guitar before ultimately becoming The Most Serene Republic.\n\nTheir debut album \"Underwater Cinematographer\" was produced, mixed and engineered by Lenssen and mastered by Ryan A. Mills and recorded at ASF Studios. Its original release was in late 2004 on the independent label Sunday League Records before being picked up by Arts & Crafts. It was re-released on June 28, 2005 featuring new artwork. They were the first band signed by Arts & Crafts that was not related to Broken Social Scene in any way or form. After touring the album extensively with the likes of Metric, Stars and Broken Social Scene, the band recorded what ultimately became the \"Phages\" EP, that was first made available when the band supported The Strokes on their Canadian tour of 2006.\n\nIn 2006 longtime drummer Adam Nimmo left the band, replaced by Tony Nesbitt-Larking. Tony appeared on \"Population\" and toured with the band throughout 2008. TMSR spent much of 2007 prepping their second album \"Population\", which was released by Arts & Crafts on October 2, 2007 to generally positive reviews.\n\nIn 2007 Jewett and Lenssen appeared on MTV Canada to promote the release of \"Population\". This would be the band's first television appearance. The two were interviewed during the airing of Making The Band wearing Star Trek outfits. During the interview they said they were on their way to a Star Trek Convention following the interview. In 2008 the full band appeared on MTV Live for an interview and three-song performance.\n\nIn an interview from June 17, 2008, guitarist Nick Greaves stated that the band will be recording their third album with Broken Social Scene and Super Furry Animals producer David Newfeld, and hinted there might be a slight change of musical direction.\n\n2008 saw the release of Live At XMU, a 4-song acoustic EP made up of songs from \"Population\" and \"Phages\". It was recorded December 11, 2007 at the XMU studios in Washington, D.C.and released August 12, 2008 exclusively to iTunes.\n\nOn April 20, 2009, the band announced their newest album, \"...And The Ever Expanding Universe\", would be released on July 14, and offered the album's second track, \"Heavens to Purgatory\", as a free download. In addition, they announced that an EP of 16-bit remixes entitled \"Digital Population\" would be released on April 28.\n\nOn August 14 their song \"Humble Peasants\" was featured in the trailer for \"A Generation After Genocide\" a documentary about the healing power of soccer in Rwanda.\n\nTheir video \"Heavens to Purgatory\" was directed by Ben Steiger-Levine and was nominated for Video of the Year at the 2010 Juno Awards.\n\nThe band released \"Pre Serene: Thee Oneironauts\", a remastered compilation of material recorded by the band's direct ancestor, Thee Oneironauts in the latter half of 2003, on May 24, 2011.\n\nThe Most Serene Republic have announced a return to action with their first new full-length album in six years, Mediac, which will arrive November 13 on MapleMusic Recordings. Mediac was recorded in Toronto, produced by TMSR's Ryan Lenssen, and mixed by David Newfeld (Broken Social Scene/Super Furry Animals/Los Campesinos!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2224170", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2224170", "title": "Problematization", "text": "Problematization\n\nProblematization of a term, writing, opinion, ideology, identity, or person is to consider the concrete or existential elements of those involved as challenges (problems) that invite the people involved to transform those situations. It is a method of defamiliarization of common sense.\n\nProblematization is a critical thinking and pedagogical dialogue or process and may be considered \"demythicisation\". Rather than taking the common knowledge (myth) of a situation for granted, problematization poses that knowledge as a problem, allowing new viewpoints, consciousness, reflection, hope, and action to emerge.\n\nWhat may make problematization different from other forms of criticism is its target, the context and details, rather than the pro or con of an argument. More importantly, this criticism does not take place within the original context or argument, but draws back from it, re-evaluates it, leading to action which changes the situation. Rather than accepting the situation, one emerges from it, abandoning a focalised viewpoint.\n\nTo problematize a statement, for example, one asks simple questions:\n\n\nThe term is also used in association with actor–network theory (ANT), and especially the \"sociology of translation\" to describe the initial phase of a translation process and the creation of a network. According to Michel Callon, problematization involves two elements:\n\n\nFor Michel Foucault, problematization serves as the overarching concept of his work in \"History of Madness\".\n\nHe treats it both as an object of inquiry and a specific form of critical analysis. As an object of inquiry, problematization is described as a process of objects becoming problems by being “characterized, analyzed, and treated” as such.\n\nAs a form of analysis, problematization seeks to answer the questions of “how and why certain things (behavior; phenomena, processes) became a problem”. Foucault does not distinguish clearly problematization as an object of inquiry from problematization as a way of inquiry. Problematization as a specific form of critical analysis is a form of “re-problematization”.\n\nProblematization is the core of his “history of thought” which stands in sharp contrast to \"history of ideas\" (\"the analysis of attitudes and types of action\") as well as \"history of mentalities\" (\"the analysis of systems of representation\"). The history of thought refers to an inquiry of what it is, in a given society and epoch, \"“what allows one to take a step back from his way of acting or reacting, to present it to oneself as an object of thought and question it as to its meaning, its conditions and its goals”.\" Therefore, thought is described as a form of self-detachment from one's own action that allows “to present it to oneself as an object of thought [and] to question it as to its meaning, its conditions, and its goals\". Thought is the reflection of one's own action “as a problem”. According to Foucault, the notions of thought and problematization are closely linked: to problematize is to engage in “work of thought”. Crucially, then, Foucault implies that our way of reflecting upon ourselves as individuals, as political bodies, as scientific disciplines or other, has a history and, consequently, imposes specific (rather than universal or a priori) structures upon thought.\n\nA central element in the problematization analysis are responses to problems. The analysis of a specific problematization is “the history of an answer (…) to a certain situation”. However, Foucault stresses that \"most of the time different responses [...] are proposed\". His analytical interest focuses on finding at the root of those diverse and possibly contrasting answers, the conditions of possibility of their simultaneous appearance, i.e. “the general form of problematization”. This sets Foucauldian problematization apart from many other approaches in that it invites researchers to view opposing scientific theories or political views, and indeed contradictory enunciations in general as responses to the same problematization rather than as the manifestations of mutually excluding discourses. It is this level of problematizations and discourses that Foucault refers to when establishing that Foucault's “history of thought” seeks to answer the question of \"how [...] a particular body of knowledge [is] able to be constituted?\".\n\nEngaging in \"problematization\" entails questioning beliefs held to be true by society. Ultimately, this intellectual practice is “to participate in the formation of a political will”. It also carves out elements that “pose problems for politics”. At the same time, it also requires self-reflection on behalf of the intellectual, since \"problematization\" is to investigate into the ontological question of the present and to determine a distinguishing “element of the present\". This element is decisive for the “process that concerns thought, knowledge, and philosophy” in which the intellectual is part of as “element and actor\". By questioning the present, or “contemporaneity”, “as an event”, the analyst constitutes the event's “meaning, value, philosophical particularity” but relies at the same time on it, for he/she “find[s] both [his/her] own raison d’être and the grounds for what [he/she] says” in the event itself.\n"}

{"id": "2224176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2224176", "title": "Frankie Andreu", "text": "Frankie Andreu\n\nFrancisco \"Frankie\" Andreu (born September 26, 1966) is an American former professional cyclist whose career highlights include riding as team captain of the U.S. Postal Service cycling team in 1998, 1999 and 2000. During his career, he won a number of race stages and finished fourth in the cycling road race at the 1996 Olympics. His testimony played a key part in the United States Anti-Doping Agency's investigation of fellow U.S. Postal cyclist Lance Armstrong's doping practices.\n\nAndreu was born in Dearborn, Michigan. He began his cycling career in track cycling, with Wolverine Sports Club in Detroit, winning the individual pursuit during the 1984 Junior National Track Cycling Championships in Trexlertown, Pennsylvania. In 1985, he finished first in the Madison during the National Track Cycling Championships in Indianapolis, Indiana and second in the points race and team pursuit. In 1988, he qualified as a member of the United States cycling team for that year's Olympic Games, where he finished eighth in the points race.\n\nAndreu moved from track cycling to road cycling after signing to the 7-Eleven Pro Cycling Team in 1989 when he finished his first professional stage race, the Giro d'Italia. His highest finish in the Tour de France was second during the 18th stage of the 1993 race where he was teammates with a young Lance Armstrong on the Motorola Pro cycling team. Andreu finished fourth in the road race during the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nHe is best remembered by the professional cycling community for his role as a \"super domestique\".\n\nIn a September 2006 interview given to \"The New York Times\", Andreu admitted that he had taken the performance-enhancing drug erythropoietin (EPO) to help prepare for the 1999 Tour de France. Andreu said that he was introduced to performance-enhancing drugs in 1995 while he was riding for Motorola.\n\nAndreu gave more details in his September 2012 USADA affidavit declaring he used EPO in 1998 as he traveled preparing for the 1999 Tour. Andreu declared he knowingly received EPO injections in 1999 after races by the USPS Team doctor, Luis Garcia del Moral. His wife, Betsy, became suspicious when she watched her husband pull Armstrong through the Alps at Sestriere during the ninth stage of the 1999 Tour, which paved the way for Armstrong to win the first of his seven titles. She knew that Frankie was a sprinter, not a climber; normally, it would have been all he could do to finish a mountain stage. Her suspicions were confirmed shortly after the Tour, when she found a thermos with EPO in their refrigerator. Betsy questioned Andreu about the drugs and was very upset. In a signed affidavit to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), Andreu testified he responded to his wife by saying: \"You don't understand. This is the only way I can keep up in the Tour.\" Betsy then told her husband that if he needed to dope to be on the USPS team, he shouldn't be riding for it.\n\nAndreu continued to ride strongly for the USPS Team in 2000 and to serve as the team's Assistant Director in 2001 and 2002.\n\nIn 2005, Andreu and his wife Betsy testified that Lance Armstrong told cancer doctors in their presence in 1996 he had doped with EPO (erythropoietin), growth hormone and steroids. This took place after Frankie Andreu began using performance-enhancing drugs himself in 1995. The Andreus' testimony was intended to remain sealed in court documents and is among thousands of pages of documents related to litigation between Armstrong and a Texas-based company that was attempting to withhold a $5 million bonus. Armstrong swore under oath it didn't happen. Frankie Andreu never offered information to media sources on the topic until court documents were released. He then stood by his testimony when giving interviews. A settlement was reached in February 2006 before the three-person arbitration panel made a ruling. As part of the settlement, SCA Promotions paid Armstrong and Tailwind Sports $7.5 million, to cover the $5-million bonus plus interest and lawyers' fees. In a statement, Armstrong said, \"It's over. We won. They lost. I was yet again completely vindicated.\" Armstrong's statement also suggested that Betsy Andreu may have been confused by possible mention of his post-operative treatment which included steroids and EPO that are routinely taken to counteract wasting and red-blood-cell destroying effects of intensive chemotherapy. In that period of time, the Andreus claim to have received threatening messages on their answering machine left by Stephanie McIlvain, the Oakley representative for Armstrong. In one of them, she stated that she hopes someone \"breaks a baseball bat over your [Betsy's] head\", among other threats. In 2012, the Andreus participated in the USADA investigation into Armstrong's doping practices, testifying along with 24 other witnesses, including former Armstrong teammates. Armstrong did not contest the doping charges, was banned for life from competing and was stripped of all results from August 1, 1998 onward, including his seven Tour de France titles. In the USADA's 200 page \"Reasoned decision\", the hospital room incident where the Andreus heard Armstrong say to his doctor that he took performance-enhancing drugs was covered in great details in the \"Addendum Part 2\".\n\nIn a January 2013 interview, Lance Armstrong finally admitted that he had used performance-enhancing drugs for much of his professional career, including all seven of his Tour de France wins. In response to being asked if the 1996 claims by the Andreus were true, he responded; \"Um, I’m not gonna take that on. I’m laying down on that one\". He also admitted to describing Betsy as a \"crazy bitch\".\n\nAndreu has served as a bicycle race commentator for Universal Sports on the Versus television network since retiring from professional cycling in 2001 and remains active in domestic pro racing, often lending his voice and knowledge announcing for professional races. Frankie also serves as the official voice of the USA CRITS Series on USACRITS.tv \n\nIn 2007, Andreu became the director of Rock Racing, but resigned in January 2008 stating differences \"with business strategies and the direction the team is headed\". When Andreu started out with Rock Racing, he described in a Cycling News interview how attitudes in cycling had changed, and that it was no longer acceptable to use drugs. A year later, it was clear that there were differences between him and the owner of Rock & Republic jeans, Michael Ball. Andreu was unhappy that his role as a director was being undermined; in some instances, he was not consulted before riders were signed. Many of the riders, including Tyler Hamilton, Santiago Botero, Oscar Sevilla and Mario Cipollini, were involved in or linked to drug investigations in cycling. This raised eyebrows, especially when aligned with Ball's \"win or you're fired\" mentality.\nAndreu was working with the American women's cycling team, Proman, in 2008. The team hoped to draw attention to women's cycle racing with Andreu's leadership.\n\nIn 2010, Andreu took the position of \"directeur sportif\" for the Kenda Pro Cycling team, a UCI Continental team sponsored by 5-hour Energy.\n\nAndreu was also identified as the only American that Lance Armstrong would allow to interview him in Alex Gibney's documentary \"The Armstrong Lie\".\n\n\n"}

A total of seventeen train cars, carrying over 3000 passengers, were wrecked. Estimates of the death toll ranged as high as over 130. It was the worst train accident in Pakistan in fifteen years.\n\nThe \"Quetta Express\" was stopped at Sarhad station because of a fault in the brakes when the \"Karachi Express\" travelling from Lahore to Karachi on the same line half an hour later and moving at about 120km/h (75mph), collided with it from behind. An emergency brake application after the crew saw the tail light of the stopped train could not prevent the collision because of insufficient braking power; two coaches had been isolated from the train braking system. The collision caused at least three train cars to derail onto the opposite direction track, where they were subsequently hit by \"Tezgam\", heading from Karachi to Rawalpindi. More cars were derailed by this second impact, bringing the total to thirteen. All three trains were full of passengers, as trains often are in Pakistan. a total of seventeen cars were wrecked, with over 3000 passengers. \n\nThe Ghotki crash was the worst rail accident in Pakistan since the 1990 Sukkur rail disaster.

The artwork is done solo by Dean Ormston throughout most of the series' run. Steve Yeowell is co-credited as an artist in issues eleven and twelve and Duncan Fegredo fully replaces Ormston for issues six and ten.\n\nThe series depicts the events that take place on two fictional worlds, both of which are connected through an alternate version of the character Timothy Hunter.\n\nWhen Timothy Hunter first appeared he was a young boy who had the potential to be the world's most powerful magic user. He starred in his own series titled \"The Books of Magic\". Over the course of the character's history he changed and aged.\n\nThe idea behind \"Books of Magick: Life During Wartime\" was to present a more mature version of \"The Books of Magic\" without the character's past continuity attached. During the planning stage a problem appeared. A series of books based on the comics and also titled \"The Books of Magic\" had been released and marketed in this form to children. \"Books of Magick: Life During Wartime\" depicts nudity and sex, as well as a higher degree of violence than \"The Books of Magic\". Although tastefully depicted these things make it a series inappropriate for children and there were fears that the new series and the books could be confused in some sectors. The decision to change 'Magic' to 'Magick' and to add the words 'Life During Wartime' was made and the series went forward.\n\nThe true Earth of this series is a world upon which humans (known as the Bred) live side-by-side with members of the races of Faerie (known as the Born). It is a world torn by war. On one side is the ruling elite made exclusively of Born. On the other is the Coalition made up of both Born and Bred. The majority on both sides are members of the same religion. They worship Tim Hunter as a god under the name The Hunter.\n\nThe second Earth is known as Hunter's World and was created by Hunter as a means of protection and escape. The things he was running from were magic, war, and religion. As a result, when he created Hunter's World none of those things existed there.\n\nThe first five issues detail the current status quo in the final days of the war. The Born make their final attack and the war ends in issues seven to nine. Issues eleven to fifteen show the aftermath of these events with eleven and twelve dealing with the true Earth and thirteen, fourteen and fifteen showing the fate of Hunter's World and the main cast of characters. These three sections are separated by two one issue stories that show events from the perspective of two supporting characters. Issue six shows Dog's perspective while issue ten deals with Cat's.\n\n\nThe series starts fifteen months into the war between the Born and the Coalition.\n\nOn the real world John Constantine finds himself in charge of the besieged city of Kraków. The forces inside are surrounded by the soldiers of the Born under the command of a monstrous Faerie known as The Cherish, and the food stores ran out seven months previously. In Jerusalem Zatanna searches for a way to obtain the three keys that will give her access to the Books of Magick. Her hope is that the books will allow Tim Hunter to regain all of his memories when he comes back from his exile.\n\nThings get worse for the Coalition when an apparition of the Hunter appears worldwide. Seeing this the Coalition launches its naval fleet from Reykjavík to attack England (known as Albion on this world) despite the misgiving of Lord Midian. This turns out to be a disastrous move when the fleet is destroyed by giant wood golems guarding the landing beaches. In Kraków things get much worse when the forces surrounding the city begin launching deadly cluster spells. On top of all of this Zatanna is captured in Jerusalem and tortured. The pain of this last event is lessened when Zatanna escapes taking the three keys to the Books of Magick with her. The apparition also allows the Faerie Queen to discover Tim's location. She sends her agents, the Micturides to get him.\n\nOn Hunter's World, Tim meets his girlfriend Molly at the train station. Later they meet with their friends Cat and Dog who give Tim a book named \"The Books of Magick\". After looking through it he collapses and sees a vision of the real world. While in the middle of this vision he inadvertently causes the apparition that appeared there.\n\nThis event causes Brewster to make his presence known. He introduces himself a few days later and enters Tim's circle of friends. Brewster begins to take actions that are designed to force Tim to use his powers and to remember magic again.\n\nStrange things begin to happen around Tim at this point. These culminate when Cat collapses one day. Her eyes turn solid red and insects begin to exit her mouth. Tim drives to the oceanside and submerges her and himself in the water. The magic he uses in this location allows him to save her. While this is going on The Micturides arrive and are confronted by Brewster.\n\nOn the true Earth things are dark for the Coalition. The Born begin their invasion of Iceland (known as Thule on this world and the last nation still under Coalition control).\n\nOn Hunter's World Tim has regained enough of his memories to know who he is and where he comes from. He creates a church and has a funeral for Brewster who he believes was killed by the Micturides. In attendance are the very confused Molly, Cat and Dog. A very much still living Brewster arrives and begins to argue with Tim over Tim's actions. The argument grows heated and Tim's church is cracked in half. In the chaos Molly, Cat and Dog disappear only to appear in the real world. Molly appears to John Constantine in Kraków. Dog appears in Zatanna's shower in Jerusalem while she is taking a shower. Finally, Cat appears in front of a captured Lord Midian in Thule and is taken prisoner alongside the other Coalition survivors.\n\nTim arrives back in the real world along with Brewster. While deciding what to do they encounter a group of Alfar, a Faerie race known for eating other sentients, Tim begins a relationship with one of their women named Birgit. After coming to a decision on what his actions should be Tim transports his allies to the prison in Thule where Cat and Midian are being held. They rescue Cat but Midian dies from wounds he received while being tortured.\n\nWhile Tim is in Thule, The Cherish gives the order to begin the final assault on Kraków. Tim and his allies teleport in not long after that order is given. In the battle Birgit is killed and Tim challenges the Cherish to one on one combat. The head of the Cherish's conjoined twin is cut off by one of her own soldiers just as she is about to kill Tim. This soldier is a worshiper of the Hunter and did not wish to see his god killed. This small victory is not enough to save the day as the forces of the Born overwhelm the city's defenders and the war comes to a conclusion.\n\nTim, Molly, Constantine and Cat are taken as prisoners to Jerusalem where they are placed in chains at the head of a victory parade led by The Cherish. The spectacle winds its way through the streets on its way to the Queen's palace.\n\nSeeing this Zatanna and Dog hatch a plan to steal the last of the Books of Magick. Slipping into the palace they quickly make their way to the room containing the last book. Just as they are about to take the book the soldiers assigned to guard the book discover their presence.\n\nIn the Queen's throne room, Tim and his allies are presented to the Queen. Tim casts an illusionary spell that distracts the Queen long enough to allow an escape. Constantine leads this small group through the palace halls to where Zatanna and Dog are fighting. Now joined together, Tim and his allies take the last of the books and fight their way to a place of temporary safety. There Tim assembles all four books and casts the spell that will give him all of his memories back.\n\nThe spell fails and the Faerie Queen appears in the doorway. John Constantine goes to her and they embrace. He reveals that he is her lover, that he has been working for the Born the entire time and that the two of them destroyed the true Books of Magick months previously. As The Queen prepares to kill Tim and end any threat to her reign, Tim joins hands with Molly, Cat and Dog and casts a spell. Tim's three friends from Hunter's World crumble before his eyes and disappear. The effect on the Faerie Queen is similar as she dies and takes on the appearance of a desiccated corpse.\n\nSeeking to see the Queen's true appearance Zatanna turns the corpse over only to see a feminine version of Tim's face. Constantine reveals that she was an alternate version of Tim and both he and Zatanna reveal to Tim that Constantine's actions were a double cross. Constantine's plan was to trick the Queen into allowing a small group close enough that she could be killed.\n\nSince Tim's return to the true world, the social situation on Hunter's World has deteriorated. Tim returns with Brewster and is shocked to find that the strange events that preceded his departure have caused a religion to form. In a reflection of the true world this religion worships Tim as a deity under the name The Hunter.\n\nThis world has its own version of John Constantine named Jackie Constantine. We meet her in her job as a delivery girl. Her assignment is to take a small package to the church that Tim created. Since Tim's leavetaking it has become the center of the new religion and the home for its leaders, the Holy Six. Jackie's delivery goes wrong and she barely gets away with her life.\n\nJackie is fired and now jobless she rescues a young woman from Hunter worshippers who were about to burn her at the stake. The young woman's name is Charlotte and the two of them become lovers. Later Jackie encounters a woman running from some more Hunter worshippers and saves her as well. This woman turns out to be the woman that Tim created on Hunter's World to be his \"mother.\" This rescue leads to an encounter with Molly, Dog and Cat who have recently reappeared back on Hunter's World. The three of them and Brewster have a mission for her.\n\nTim has decided to destroy Hunter's World and Jackie is sent to talk to him in hopes that she can talk him out of it. She fails at this and Hunter's World ceases to exist. The only survivors are Jackie, Charlotte, Tim's \"Mother,\" Dog, Cat and Molly. Along with Brewster, Tim transports this group to another realm using two cabins from the Hunter's World version of the London Eye.\n\nThis new world is a place of lush green beauty free from predators. Tim tells Cat and Dog that they are not really brother and sister and that they will be this dimension's Adam and Eve.\n\nTim takes the rest of his group to the Realm of Faerie to drop off Brewster and to have a talk with Titania, the Queen of Faerie (not to be confused with the foe he defeated). Molly and Tim's \"mother\" wander, see what Faerie is like and decide to stay.\n\nJackie and Charlotte travel with Tim to the true Earth. There Tim uses his powers to set them up in a new life.\n\nAlthough most of the reviews were favorable, there was some criticism. Most of this centered around the thought that, despite the fact that the story had no connection to the history of Timothy Hunter, you still needed to know that history to fully understand many plot details. A review from TheForthRail.com complained \"The writers seem to assume that the reader will be familiar with Tim's history.\"\n\nThere has been one trade paperback collection so far:\n\n"}

The song was written by bassist Dee Dee Ramone in the style of the Beach Boys and early surf rock bands. The song is about Rockaway Beach, Queens, where Dee Dee liked to spend time. Guitarist Johnny Ramone claimed that Dee Dee was \"the only real beachgoer\" in the group. Released in 1977, it was the Ramones' highest-charting single in their career, peaking at number 66 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. In June 2013, the song was used in a radio ad campaign sponsored by Queens Economic Development Corporation to promote recovery from Hurricane Sandy by drawing New Yorkers back to Rockaway Beach.\n\n\"Rockaway Beach\" was inspired by the actual Rockaway Beach located in New York, where lead singer Joey Ramone was raised. The song was written by bassist Dee Dee Ramone who frequently visited the beach.\n\n\"Rockaway Beach\" is an punk rock song that runs for a duration of two minutes and six seconds. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music, it is written in the time signature of common time, with a driving punk rock tempo of 185 beats per minute. \"Rockaway Beach\" is composed in the key of A major, while Joey Ramone's vocal range spans from the low-note of E to the high-note of A. The song has a basic sequence of C–D–C–D during the introduction, follows A–D–E in the verses and chorus, and changes to G–D–D–E–F–C at the bridge as its chord progression. \n\nThe musical arrangement opens with an instrumental introduction, where a rhythm guitar part is played at high-speed using downstrokes with grinding distortion. \"Rockaway Beach\" is a breezy number laden with catchy hooks. It express carefree lyrics that hearken back to simpler, brighter days of the band's youth. The song's verses illustrate an idiosyncratic worldview, one flanked by surfboards and discotheques. They celebrate a scene set in the middle of a hot summer in New York.\n\nGreg Beets of \"The Austin Chronicle\" called the song \"backhanded genius.\" AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine cites \"Rockaway Beach\" as being among the \"finest set of songs\" Ramones had written for \"Rocket to Russia\". He characterized its musical composition as \"teeming with irresistibly catchy hooks.\" Gina Boldman, from the same publication, praised the song's \"mindless, bopping opening\" and summarized, \"One of the group's most carefree and breezy songs ... The imagery puts you right in the middle of a hot New York summer in the mid-to-late '70s, and it's easy to feel as jubilant as the song (and Ramone) does. \"Time Out\"'s Steve Smith hailed the song as a \"bubblegum masterpiece.\" Music critic Robert Christgau regarded \"Rockaway Beach\" as an \"actual potential hit.\" In his review of the anniversary edition, Zachary Hopskins from \"Slant Magazine\" ranks the song one of the group's \"stone-cold classics: as likely to put a smile on one’s face and a bounce in one’s Chucks in 2017 as they were 40 years ago.\"\n\n\"Rockaway Beach\" has since become the Ramones' highest charting single, peaking at number sixty-six on \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n"}

{"id": "2224213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2224213", "title": "English units", "text": "English units\n\nEnglish units are the units of measurement used in England up to 1826 (when they were replaced by Imperial units), which evolved as a combination of the Anglo-Saxon and Roman systems of units. Various standards have applied to English units at different times, in different places, and for different applications.\n\nThe two main sets of English units were the Winchester Units, used from 1495–1587, as affirmed by King Henry VII, and the Exchequer Standards, in use from 1588–1825, as defined by Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nThe English units were replaced by Imperial Units in 1824 (effective 1 January 1826) by a Weights and Measures Act, which retained many though not all of the unit names and redefined (standardised) many of the definitions.\n\nUse of the term \"English units\" can be ambiguous, as, in addition to the meaning used in this article, it is sometimes mistakenly used to refer to United States customary units, which have somewhat different definitions, or to Imperial units, the standard units throughout the British Empire and Commonwealth.\n\nVery little is known of the measurement units of the British Isles prior to Roman colonisation in the 1st century AD. During the Roman period, Roman Britain relied on Ancient Roman units of measurement. During the Anglo-Saxon period, the North German foot of 13.2 inches (335 millimetres) was the nominal basis for other units of linear measurement. The foot was divided into 4 palms or 12 thumbs. A cubit was 2 feet, an elne 4 feet. The rod was 15 Anglo-Saxon feet, the furlong 10 rods. An acre was 4 × 40 rods, i.e. 160 square rods or 36,000 square Anglo-Saxon feet. However, Roman units continued to be used in the construction crafts, and reckoning by the Roman mile of 5,000 feet (or 8 stades) continued, in contrast to other Germanic countries which adopted the name \"mile\" for a longer native length closer to the league (which was 3 Roman miles). From the time of Offa King of Mercia (8th century) until 1526 the \"Saxon pound\", also known as the \"moneyers' pound\" (and later known as the Tower pound) was the fundamental unit of weight (by Offa's law, one pound of silver, by weight, was subdivided into 240 silver pennies, hence (in money) 240 pence - twenty shillings - was known as \"one pound\").\n\nPrior to the enactment of a law known as the \"Composition of Yards and Perches\" () some time between 1266 and 1303, the English system of measurement had been based on that of the Anglo-Saxons, who were descended from tribes of northern Germany. The \"Compositio\" retained the Anglo-Saxon rod of 5.03 metres and the acre of 4 × 40 rods. However, it redefined the yard, foot, inch, and barleycorn to of their previous value. Thus, the rod went from 5 old yards to new yards, or 15 old feet to new feet. The furlong went from 600 old feet (200 old yards) to 660 new feet (220 new yards). The acre went from 36,000 old square feet to 43,560 new square feet. Scholars have speculated that the \"Compositio\" may have represented a compromise between the two earlier systems of units, the Anglo-Saxon and the Roman.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the Norman conquest of England had little effect on British weights and measures, other than to introduce one new unit: the bushel. William the Conqueror, in one of his first legislative acts, confirmed existing Anglo-Saxon measurement, a position which was consistent with Norman policy in dealing with occupied peoples. Another popular myth is that the Magna Carta of 1215 (specifically chapter 35) had a significant effect on English weights and measures, for this document only mentions one unit (the London Quarter) but does not define it.\n\nLater development of the English system was by defining the units in laws and by issuing measurement standards. Standards were renewed in 1496, 1588 and 1758. The last \"Imperial Standard Yard\" in bronze was made in 1845; it served as the standard in the United Kingdom until the yard was redefined by the international yard and pound agreement (as 0.9144 metres) in 1959 (statutory implementation was in the Weights and Measures Act of 1963). Over time, the English system had spread to other parts of the British Empire.\n\nSelected excerpts from the bibliography of \"Marks and Marking of Weights and Measures of the British Isles\"\n\n\n\n\nMany measures of capacity were understood as fractions or multiples of a gallon. For example, a quart is a quarter of a gallon, and a pint is half of a quart, or an eighth of a gallon. These ratios applied regardless of the specific size of the gallon. Not only did the definition of the gallon change over time, but there were several different kinds of gallon, which existed at the same time. For example, a wine gallon with a volume of 231 cubic inches (the basis of the U.S. gallon), and an ale gallon of 282 cubic inches, were commonly used for many decades prior to the establishment of the imperial gallon. In other words, a pint of ale and a pint of wine were not the same size. On the other hand, some measures such as the fluid ounce were not defined as a fraction of a gallon. For that reason, it is not always possible to give accurate definitions of units such as pints or quarts, in terms of ounces, prior to the establishment of the imperial gallon.\n\n\nLiquid measures as binary submultiples of their respective gallons (ale or wine):\n\nWine is traditionally measured based on the \"wine gallon\" and its related units. Other liquids such as brandy, spirits, mead, cider, vinegar, oil, honey, and so on, were also measured and sold in these units.\n\nThe wine gallon was re-established by Queen Anne in 1707 after a 1688 survey found the Exchequer no longer possessed the necessary standard but had instead been depending on a copy held by the Guildhall. Defined as 231 cubic inches, it differs from the later imperial gallon, but is equal to the United States customary gallon.\n\n\nThe Winchester measure, also known as the corn measure, centered on the bushel of approximately 2,150.42 cubic inches, which had been in use with only minor modifications since at least the late 15th century. The word \"corn\" at that time referred to all types of grain. The corn measure was used to measure and sell many types of dry goods, such as grain, salt, ore, and oysters.\n\nHowever, in practice, such goods were often sold by weight. For example, it might be agreed by local custom that a bushel of wheat should weigh 60 pounds, or a bushel of oats should weigh 33 pounds. The goods would be measured out by volume, and then weighed, and the buyer would pay more or less depending on the actual weight. This practice of specifying bushels in weight for each commodity continues today. This was not always the case though, and even the same market that sold wheat and oats by weight might sell barley simply by volume. In fact, the entire system was not well standardized. A sixteenth of a bushel might be called a \"pottle\", \"hoop\", \"beatment\", or \"quartern\", in towns only a short distance apart. In some places potatoes might be sold by the firkin—usually a liquid measure—with one town defining a firkin as 3 bushels, and the next town as 2 1/2 bushels.\n\nThe pint was the smallest unit in the corn measure. The corn gallon, one eighth of a bushel, was approximately 268.8 cubic inches. Most of the units associated with the corn measure were binary (sub)multiples of the bushel:\nOther units included the \"wey\" (6 or sometimes 5 seams or quarters), and the \"last\" (10 seams or quarters).\n\n\nThe Avoirdupois, Troy and Apothecary systems of weights all shared the same finest unit, the grain; however, they differ as to the number of grains there are in a dram, ounce and pound. This grain was legally defined as the weight of a grain seed from the middle of an ear of barley. There also was a smaller \"wheat grain\", said to be (barley) grains or about 48.6 milligrams.\n\nThe avoirdupois pound contained 7,000 grains and was used for all products not subject to Apothecaries's or Tower weight.\n\nAdditions:\nThe Troy and Tower pounds and their subdivisions were used for coins and precious metals. The Tower pound, which was based upon an earlier Anglo-Saxon pound, was replaced by the Troy pound when a proclamation dated 1526 required the Troy pound to be used for mint purposes instead of the Tower pound. No standards of the Tower pound are known to have survived.\n\nIn terms of nominal currency units, a pound was 20 shillings of 12 pennies each (i.e. 240) from the late 8th century (Charlemagne/Offa of Mercia) to 1971 in the United Kingdom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Recorded between November 2001 and February 2002 at studios in Hawaii, Pennsylvania and California, it was produced by the band's lead guitarist and backing vocalist Chad I Ginsburg with lead vocalist and guitarist Deron Miller and released on September 24, 2002 by Island Records. The album was the band's first to chart, reaching number 99 on the US \"Billboard\" 200.\n\nIn contrast to CKY's 1999 debut album \"Volume 1\", the songwriting for which was originally credited solely to the band's frontman Miller, \"Infiltrate•Destroy•Rebuild\" featured equal songwriting credits for all three members of the band, including lead guitarist Ginsburg and drummer Jess Margera. Once again, bass on the album was performed by Miller (as well as some by Ginsburg), with live bassist Vernon Zaborowski (who replaced Ryan Bruni in 2000) left off the record completely.\n\nMuch like its predecessor, \"Infiltrate•Destroy•Rebuild\" was praised by a number of music critics for its wide range of musical styles, as well as specific elements such as its guitar riffs. Music videos were produced by Bam Margera and Joe Frantz for all ten tracks on the album, which were released on the video album \"\" in 2003. \"Flesh Into Gear\" was released as a single in 2002, reaching number 38 on the \"Billboard\" Mainstream Rock chart.\n\nRecording for \"Infiltrate•Destroy•Rebuild\" took place at Audio Resource in Honolulu, Hawaii, Studio 4 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and 4th St. Recording and Westlake Audio in Santa Monica, California; mixing was completed at Westlake Audio. Production was led by guitarist Chad I Ginsburg, with vocalist Deron Miller credited as a co-producer. Ginsburg also mixed the album, which was mastered by Howie Weinberg. Recording began in November 2001 and was completed by February 2002.\n\nMany of the songs featured on the album were written and recorded in the form of demos years previously: early recordings of \"Flesh Into Gear\" (originally titled \"Sinking Fast\"), \"Sink Into the Underground\", \"Attached at the Hip\", \"Plastic Plan\" (originally titled \"No Such Thing\"), \"Inhuman Creation Station\" and \"Sporadic Movement\" were featured on the videos \"CKY2K\" and \"CKY 3\", and an early version of \"Close Yet Far\" (under the title \"Fairman's Song\") was included on the original pressing of \"Volume 2\".\n\nUnlike on \"Volume 1\", where songwriting was credited to Miller alone, writing for \"Infiltrate•Destroy•Rebuild\" was credited to all three band members: Miller, Ginsburg and drummer Jess Margera. The album is also the band's first to feature synthesizers, which were performed by Miller and Ginsburg. At least one song was intended for inclusion on the album, but later removed – \"Dropped and Doublecrossed\", an early version of which was released under the name \"Dropped\" on \"Volume 2\", which was later reworked and released on the band's 2009 fourth studio album \"Carver City\" under the name \"Plagued by Images\".\n\nCKY continued its affiliation with the video series of the same name, as several early recordings of songs from \"Infiltrate•Destroy•Rebuild\" were featured on the videos \"CKY2K\" and \"CKY3\" prior to the release of the album. The album was released on September 24, 2002 as an enhanced CD featuring music videos for \"Flesh Into Gear\" and \"Attached at the Hip\", although the original pressing had a glitch which prevented the videos from playing. \"Flesh Into Gear\" was also released as a single, reaching number 38 on the US \"Billboard\" Mainstream Rock chart.\n\nThe group began touring the US in promotion of the album, but in November was invited by Guns N' Roses frontman Axl Rose to perform in Vancouver, British Columbia as the opening warm-up act for the Chinese Democracy Tour, just three days before it was due to begin. However, due to a delayed flight blamed on \"mechanical troubles\", Rose failed to arrive to Vancouver in time and the show had to be cancelled, inciting riots started by audience members. It was later announced that CKY would return to perform on the remainder of the United States leg of the tour, which was ultimately cancelled almost a month early. CKY toured extensively in promotion of the album, with high-profile slots supporting bands such as Metallica.\n\nIn November 2003 the band released \"\", featuring music videos for all ten tracks on the album, as well \"96 Quite Bitter Beings\" and \"Disengage the Simulator\", behind the scenes footage, a photo gallery, and a documentary titled \"CKY: Chopped & Sliced\".\n\nSpeaking about the lyrics on \"Infiltrate•Destroy•Rebuild\", PopMatters writer Nikki Tranter proposed that many of the songs on the album are written about \"the decaying state of humanity\", in contrast to the possibly more common themes of \"odes to ex-girlfriends or a corrupt governmental structure\". The reviewer also noted that many songs \"deal with [a] need for some kind of freedom\", noting \"Close Yet Far\", \"Attached at the Hip\", \"Frenetic Amnesic\" and \"Sink Into the Underground\" as examples of this description.\n\n\"Escape from Hellview\" is the third song in the band's \"Hellview\" song series, which started with previous band Oil's \"Thanks for the Ride\" and \"Volume 1\" opening track \"96 Quite Bitter Beings\". The track is described by Bradley Torreano of music website AllMusic as an \"infectious tale of friends hanging from trees and the deafening silence of loneliness\".\n\nMany reviews of the album noted the variety of musical styles present on \"Infiltrate•Destroy•Rebuild\", which was described in a positive manner. AllMusic's Torreano dubbed \"Escape from Hellview\" a \"metal anthem\", suggested that \"Plastic Plan\" showcased a \"disco beat and lifting melodies\", and described \"Sporadic Movement\" as \"gothic metal\". Tranter of PopMatters offered many of the same descriptions in her review, also describing \"Close Yet Far\" as a \"sultry pop-rock ballad\" and including \"Flesh into Gear\" and \"Frenetic Amnesic\" alongside \"Escape from Hellview\" in the bracket of \"neat heavy rock tunes\". She concluded that the album is \"impossible to label\".\n\nA review on Punknews.org suggested that many bands mix musical genres and \"end up sounding pieced together and unnatural\", contrasting that CKY's attempt gave them \"a sound distinctly their own\", highlighting the guitar riffs, electronic elements, and distortion effects as contributing factors. Sputnikmusic identified stylistic similarities with stoner rock, punk rock and groove metal acts, while \"Billboard\" magazine described its sound as \"sometimes reminiscent of classic metal ... [with] a jagged punk edge\", describing the material as \"aggressive, yet melodic\".\n\n\"Infiltrate•Destroy•Rebuild\" was the first album released by CKY to register on a music chart, reaching number 99 on the US \"Billboard\" 200. Outside of the US, it also reached number 108 on the UK Albums Chart and number 10 on the UK Rock & Metal Albums Chart. According to Miller, as of August 2015 the album had sold over 315,000 copies, making it the best-selling CKY album.\n\nMedia response to \"Infiltrate•Destroy•Rebuild\" was generally positive. AllMusic's Torreano awarded the album four out of five stars, describing it as \"an irony-free exploration of heavy music that goes straight for the gut and keeps on punching\". He praised the band's variety of styles on the release, highlighting tracks such as \"Escape from Hellview\" and \"Sporadic Movement\". PopMatters writer Tranter was similarly positive, describing \"IDR\" as \"an album of expert modern rock tunes, bursting with intelligent ... lyrics and first-rate, progressive musical experimentation\".\n\nPunknews.org's review praised the album's writing and production, noting that it is \"a definite progression from their previous work\" but claiming that it \"has some brief moments that become almost too poppy for its own good\", namely on \"Plastic Plan\". Sputnikmusic's review also named \"Plastic Plan\" as a particularly weak point of the album, criticising the \"crowbarred into place\" chorus and claiming that it lets the album down.\n\n"}
{"id": "2224291", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2224291", "title": "Maitrī", "text": "Maitrī\n\nMaitrī (Sanskrit; Pali: mettā) means benevolence, loving-kindness, friendliness, amity, good will, and active interest in others. It is the first of the four sublime states (\"Brahmaviharas\") and one of the ten pāramīs of the Theravāda school of Buddhism.\n\nThe cultivation of benevolence (\"mettā bhāvanā\") is a popular form of Buddhist meditation. It is a part of the four immeasurables in Brahmavihara (divine abidings) meditation. \"Metta\" as 'compassion meditation' is often practiced in Asia by broadcast chanting, wherein monks chant for the laity.\n\nThe compassion and universal loving-kindness concept of \"Metta\" is discussed in the \"Metta Sutta\" of Buddhism, and is also found in the ancient and medieval texts of Hinduism and Jainism as \"Metta\" or \"Maitri\".\n\nSmall sample studies on the potential of loving-kindness meditation approach on patients suggest potential benefits. However, peer reviews question the quality and sample size of these studies, then suggest caution.\n\n\"Mettā\" is a Pali word, from \"maitrī\" itself derived from \"mitra\" which, states Monier-Williams, means \"friendly, amicable, benevolent, affectionate, kind, good-will\", as well as a form of \"love, amity, sympathy\". The term is found in this sense in the Vedic literature, such as the Shatapatha Brahmana and various early Upanishads, and Vedanga literature such as Pāṇini's \"Aṣṭādhyāyī\" 5.4.36. The term appears in Buddhist texts as an important concept and practice.\n\nBuswell and Lopez, as well as Harvey, translate \"metta\" as \"loving-kindness\". In Buddhist belief, this is a \"Brahma-vihara\" (divine abode) or an immeasurable that leads to a meditative state by being a counter to ill-will. It removes clinging to negative state of mind, by cultivating kindness unto all beings.\n\nThe \"far enemy\" of Metta is hate or ill-will, a mind-state in obvious opposition. The \"near enemy\" (quality which superficially resembles Metta but is in fact more subtly in opposition to it), is (attached) greed: here too one likes seeing a virtue, but for the wrong reason.\n\nMettā meditation, or often loving-kindness meditation, is the practice concerned with the cultivation of Mettā, i.e. benevolence, kindness, and amity. The practice generally consists of silent repetitions of phrases such as \"may you be happy\" or \"may you be free from suffering\", for example directed at a person who, depending on tradition, may or may not be internally visualized.\n\nTwo different methodological approaches have been discerned in recent review papers, practices that focus on compassion and practices focussing on loving-kindness. Focussing on compassion means that meditation consists of the wish to relieve a being from suffering, whereas focussing on loving-kindness means wishing a being happiness.\n\nThe practice gradually increases in difficulty with respect to the targets that receive the practitioner’s compassion or loving-kindness. At first the practitioner is targeting \"oneself, then loved ones, neutral ones, difficult ones and finally all beings, with variations across traditions\".\n\nDifficult may include rude, annoying, busy bodied, arrogant, self-righteous, vice-respect, neglectful, war-profiteers, fence sitters, nay-saying, charlatans, unkind, accusers, rebukes, provocation, liars, sacrilegious and unhappy.\n\nA 2015 meta-analysis synthesising various high quality experiments on loving-kindness meditation, found a medium-sized improvement to daily positive emotion, with meditation on the loving-kindness aspect of metta having a greater effect than practices with a focus on compassion. The length of time meditating did not affect the magnitude of positive impact of the practice.\n\nKindness is the actions to alleviate suffering. Taking actions to improve the subjective experience of someone suffering, having experienced the instinct to help someone suffering (compassion). Imagine the pain, hatred, evil, terrible, annoying, stressful person, and consider how he/she feels all the time. Empathy may be feeling the entirety of his/her subjective experience, and understanding their thoughts or feelings.\n\nPrior to the advent of the Buddha, according to Martin Wiltshire, there existed the traditions of \"Brahma-loka\" and meditation with the four virtues of loving-kindness, compassion, empathetic joy and equanimity. The early Buddhist texts assert that pre-Buddha ancient Indian sages who taught these virtues were earlier incarnations of the Buddha. Post-Buddha, these same virtues are found in the Hindu texts such as verse 1.33 of the \"Yoga Sutras of Patañjali\", wherein the word \"Maitri\" is synonymous with \"Metta\".\n\nLoving-kindness (maitri), along with compassion and equanimity, are found in the early Upanishads of Hinduism, while loving-kindness (metta) is found in early Sutras of Jainism along with compassion, empathetic joy and equanimity. The ancient Indian \"Paccekabuddhas\" mentioned in the early Buddhist Suttas, those who lived before the Buddha, mention all \"four immeasurables\" and Brahmavihara, and they are claimed in the Suttas to be previous incarnations of the Buddha.\n\nAccording to Peter Harvey, the Buddhist scriptures acknowledge that the \"Metta\"-concept containing four \"Brahmavihara\" meditation practices \"did not originate within the Buddhist tradition\". The Buddha never claimed that the \"four immeasurables\" and related \"Metta\"-meditation were his unique ideas, states Harvey Aronson, in a manner similar to \"cessation, quieting, nirvana\".\n\nThe pre-Buddha Chandogya Upanishad, states Jayatilleke, in section 8.15 teaches metta and ahimsa (doctrine of non-harm, esp. non-violence) to all creatures claiming that this practice leads to \"Brahmaloka\". The shift in Vedic ideas, from rituals to virtues, is particularly discernible in the early Upanishadic thought, and it is unclear as to what extent and how early Upanishadic traditions of Hinduism and Sramanic traditions such as Buddhism and Jainism influenced each other, on ideas such as \"four immeasurables\", meditation and Brahmavihara.\n\nIn the Jain text, the Tattvartha Sutra (Chapter 7, sutra 11), which is accepted by all Jainism sub-traditions as authoritative, there is a mention of four right sentiments: Maitri, pramoda, karunya, madhyastha:\n\nIn the Pāli Canon, the term metta appears in many texts such as the \"Kakacupama Sutta\" and \"Karaniya Metta Sutta\". Other canonical materials, such as in the \"Paṭisambhidāmagga\", elaborate on it as a practice. And yet other canonical sources, such as the \"Abhidhamma\", underline the key role of benevolence in the development of wholesome karma for better rebirths.\n\nThis basic statement of intention and verse can also be found in several other canonical discourses.\n\n\"Metta\" or lovingkindness here, states Harvey, is a heartfelt aspiration for the happiness of all beings. It is different than \"lack of ill-will\", and more an antidote to it, fear and hatred. It is the precept to conquer anger by kindness, conquer the liar by truth, conquer stingy by giving, conquer evil by good, states Harvey.\n\nIn over a dozen discourses, the following description (in English and Pāli) is provided for radiating loving-kindness in six directions:\n\nIn the canon, this basic formula is expanded upon in a variety of ways. For instance, a couple of discourses provide the following description to gain rebirth in the heavenly realm of Brahmā (\" sahavyatāya maggo\") :\n\nIn the \"Khuddaka Nikāya's\" \"\", traditionally ascribed to Sariputta, is a section entitled \"Mettākathā\" (Ps. 2.4, \"Story on Loving-Kindness\"). In this instruction, a general formula (below, in English and Pāli), essentially identical to the aforementioned \"Cunda Kammaraputta Sutta\" verse (especially evident in the Pāli), is provided for radiating benevolence:\n\nIn addition, this instruction categorizes twenty-two ways in which \"the mind-deliverance of benevolence\" (\"mettācetovimutti\") can be radiated with\n\nMoreover, the directional pervasions can then be applied to each of the unspecific and specific pervasions. For instance, after radiating benevolence to all beings in the east (\"Sabbe puratthimāya disāya sattā ...\"), one radiates it to all beings in the west and then north and then south, etc.; then, one radiates it to all breathing things in this fashion (\"Sabbe puratthimāya disāya ...\"), then all creatures, persons, and so forth until such is extended for all those born in the lower realms.\n\nThe Pali Canon says that there are a number of benefits from the practicing of metta meditation, including:\n\nThe Canon also upholds fully ripened metta development as a foremost antidote to ill will:\n\n\"Monks, whatever grounds there are for making merit productive of a future birth, all these do not equal a sixteenth part of the liberation of mind by benevolence. The liberation of mind by benevolence surpasses them and shines forth, bright and brilliant.\"\n\nMettā meditation is regularly recommended to the Buddha's followers in the Pali canon. The canon generally advises radiating metta in each of the six directions, to whatever beings there may be. A different set of practical instructions, still widely used today, is found in the 5th CE Visuddhimagga; this is also the main source for the 'near and far enemies' given above. In addition, variations on this traditional practice have been popularized by modern teachers and applied in modern research settings.\n\nMetta is found in pre-Buddhist Vedic Sanskrit texts as \"Maitrī\", \"Maitra\" and \"Mitra\", which are derived from the ancient root \"Mid\" (love), and these Vedic words appear in the Samhita, Aranyaka, Brahmana and Upanishad layers of texts in the Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda.\n\nSimilarly, the term appears in hymn 55 of Book 19 of the Atharvaveda, and various Upanishads. A major early Upanishad of Hinduism, named Maitri Upanishad, discusses universal kindness and amity. The Maitri Upanishad, states Martin Wiltshire, provides the philosophical underpinning, by asserting, \"what a man thinks, that he becomes, this is the eternal mystery\". This idea, adds Wiltshire, reflects the assumption in the ancient thought that man influences his own environment and situation, causality is equitable, and \"good volitional acts conduce pleasant situations, while bad volitional acts conduce unpleasant situations\". The Maitri Upanishad teaches, states Juan Mascaró, that peace begins in one's own mind, in one's longing for truth, in looking within, and that \"a quietness of mind overcomes good and evil works, and in quietness the soul is one: then one feels the joy of eternity.\"\n\nThe Isha Upanishad similarly discusses universal amity and loving-kindness, but without the term \"metta\". These teachings of universal \"Maitri\" influenced Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nIn Jainism, \"Yogabindu\" – the 6th-century yoga text by Haribhadra – uses the Sanskrit word \"Maitri\" in verses 402-404, in the sense of loving-kindness towards all living beings.\n\nSome pilot research studies on the effect of Mettā meditation indicate an increase in positive emotions for practitioners. In particular, an immediate impact on positive emotions after practice as well as a long term effect could be shown, though these effects might not hold true for everybody. In one proof-of-concept study, uncontrolled in sample selection and benchmarking, the researchers report therapeutic potential for psychological problems like depression or social anxiety, when combined with other reliable treatments.\n\nThe application of Mettā meditation for the treatment of psychological and other healthcare-related problems is the topic of current research. Hofmann et al. discuss in their paper the potential use for therapy and report insufficient data, with some promising studies so far. Those studies could show a positive impact on problems such as schizophrenia, depression and anxiety. According to Hofmann et al., there needs to be more rigorous research, especially with the application of Buddhist approaches to loving-kindness and compassion meditation.\n\nIn an 8-week pilot study in 2005, loving-kindness meditation showed reduced pain and anger in people with chronic lower back pain. Compassion meditation, a Science Daily article states, may benefit by reductions in inflammatory and behavioral responses to stress that have been linked to depression and a number of medical illnesses.\n\nBishop in a 2002 review suggests caution on claims of benefits, and states, \"what has been published has been rife with methodological problems. At present, we know very little about the effectiveness of this [mindfulness-lovingkindness-compassion meditation] approach; however, there is some evidence that suggests that it may hold some promise.\"\n\nIn a 2014 review of multiple studies, Galante et al. reach a similar conclusion, stating \"results were inconclusive for some outcomes, in particular against active controls; the methodological quality of the reports was low to moderate; results suffered from imprecision due to wide CIs (confidence intervals) deriving from small studies\" and that \"the kindness meditation methods show evidence of individual and community benefits through its effects on their well-being and social interaction\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2224300", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2224300", "title": "Franz Reizenstein", "text": "Franz Reizenstein\n\nFranz Theodor Reizenstein (7 June 191115 October 1968) was a German-born British composer and concert pianist. He left Germany for sanctuary in Britain in 1934 and went on to have his teaching and performing career there. As a composer, he successfully blended the equally strong but very different influences of his primary teachers, Hindemith and Vaughan Williams. \n\nFranz Reizenstein's parents were Dr. Albert Reizenstein (1871–1925) and Lina Kohn (b. 1880), both of Nuremberg, Germany. The family was Jewish and counted many professionals, scientists, bankers, and musically inclined people among its members. Through his mother's Kohn family, Reizenstein was related to the writer Catherine Yronwode.\n\nReizenstein grew up in Nuremberg and was considered a child prodigy. He composed his first pieces when he was 5, and by the age of 17 he had written a string quartet. His well-to-do and artistic family encouraged him to play chamber music at home. Eventually he was sent to study composition under Paul Hindemith and piano under Leonid Kreutzer at the Berliner Hochschule für Musik.\n\nIn 1934 he emigrated to England at the age of 23 to escape the Nazis, one of the first of nearly 70 émigré musicians from Nazi Europe to do so between 1933 and 1945. Once in England, he furthered his studies under Ralph Vaughan Williams at the Royal College of Music, and began to incorporate English musical influences into his works. He also studied the piano for eleven years with Solomon Cutner. Reizenstein published his first piece, the Suite for Piano, Op. 6, in 1936. He gained more attention with the \"virtuosic and flamboyant\" \"Prologue, Variations and Finale\", Op. 12, composed two years later for the violinist Max Rostal. Its South American rhythms (in the finale) were inspired by an extended tour which he took to Chile and Argentina in 1937, undertaken with another legendary violinist, Roman Totenberg. During the 1930s Reizenstein performed as a pianist and played with the violinist Carl Flesch, as well as working as a composer. He was the first to perform Hindemith's three piano sonatas of 1936 in the UK, on Wednesday 1 June 1938 at the Wigmore Hall.\n\nAt the start of World War II, Reizenstein, as a German, was interned in Central Camp in Douglas, Isle of Man. He continued to compose while within the camp although he was soon released, along with the other internees who did not pose a threat to the British. He married his wife Marguerite in 1942, and they had a son, John Reizenstein. They lived at 34, Hollycroft Avenue, London NW3.\n\nIn 1958 he became a professor (of piano, not composition) at the Royal Academy of Music and (in 1964) the Royal Manchester College of Music. Amongst his pupils at the Academy was Philip Martin whom he taught piano and also composition. His academic credentials in composition were finally officially recognised when in 1966 he was appointed Visiting Professor of Composition at Boston University for six months, where there were also special concerts given of his works.\n\nLike fellow émigré composer Hans Gál, Reizenstein rejected the serial procedures followed by many of his contemporaries and adopted a tonal, expressive style influenced by Vaughan Williams and the English lyrical tradition, tempered with the objectivity and contrapuntal complexity of Hindemith. Hugo Cole divided his work into three periods: the first (1936-1945) emphasising motivic development, rhythmic energy and fugal counterpoint; the second (1947-1959) introducing more elegiac and expressive material; and the third (1960-1968) a late style more genial and relaxed, with freer thematic development and transformation. In the first period are the early Piano Concerto and Piano Sonata No 1. In the second are the Scherzo, Op. 21, the Piano Quintet, the 12 Preludes and Fugues and the Second Piano Concerto. The late period includes the three solo string sonatas, the \"Elizabeth Browning Sonnets\" and his final work, the Concerto for String Orchestra, which received its premiere a year after his death.\n\nHe composed a number of orchestral works including overtures (such as \"Cyrano de Bergerac\", performed at the BBC Proms on 30 August 1957) and concertos (such as the two Piano Concertos, the late Concerto for String Orchestra, a Violin Concerto and a Cello Concerto). A symphony remained unfinished at his death. The chamber and piano works are particularly highly regarded, the best known of these is the Piano Quintet in D major, Op. 23 (1949) of which the critic Lionel Salter wrote in \"Gramophone\" in July 1975: It \"stands alongside Shostakovitch's as the most noteworthy of this century's piano quintets.\" The Violin Sonata (1945) was dedicated to Maria Lidka, who performed it at the premiere in January 1946. That was followed by the Viola Sonata (1946), written for Watson Forbes, who performed it the same year in Cambridge. The 12 Preludes and Fugues, heavily influenced by Hindemith's \"Ludus Tonalis\", display Reizenstein's personal harmonic idiom (heavy with 4ths and semitones) and feature pairs of preludes and fugues that are closely related thematically. \n\nThe cantata \"Voices of Night\" (1950-51) represented, according to John Weissmann, \"the complete maturity of [his] recently assimilated musical idiom...this cantata places him at a single stroke in the English choral tradition\". He also wrote two operas, \"Men Against the Sea\" (1949) and \"Anna Kraus\" (1952), and composed lavish orchestral scores for the Hammer horror film \"The Mummy\" (1959) and the cult British horror film \"Circus of Horrors\" (1960).\n\nCommercially available recordings include the piano music played by Martin Jones (Lyrita SRCD.2342, 2014), the Piano Concerto No 2 and Serenade in F with Oliver Triendl and the Nürnberger Symphoniker (CPO 555245-2, 2019), and the Violin Sonata, op 20, played by Louisa Stonehill and Nicholas Burns (Lyrita SRCD.360, 2017).\n\nReizenstein contributed the \"Concerto Popolare\" (\"A piano concerto to end all piano concertos\") to Gerard Hoffnung's first music festival in 1956. Hoffnung's festivals were comedy events, trading on the musical knowledge of the audience. The premise of the \"Concerto Popolare\" is that the orchestra believes it is playing Tchaikovsky's First Piano Concerto, but the pianist believes he or she is playing the Grieg Piano Concerto. A pitched musical battle ensues, dragging in other themes (notably from \"Rhapsody in Blue\", the \"Warsaw Concerto\" and the song \"Roll Out the Barrel\"). The soloist at the premiere was Yvonne Arnaud (otherwise a renowned actress), who had been chosen after Hoffnung's first choice, Eileen Joyce, declined.\n\nAt the 1958 Hoffnung Festival he contributed (with William Mann) \"Let's Fake an Opera or The Tales of Hoffnung\" Mann's libretto consisted of \"ridiculously juxtaposed excerpts from more than forty operas, which delighted both Reizenstein and the audience\". Daniel Snowman called it \"an insane collage of opera plots and themes\". Also popular was his set of \"Variations on The Lambeth Walk\" (a popular song of the 1930s), for solo piano, each variation being a parody of the style of a major classical composer. The composers parodied are Chopin, Verdi, Beethoven, Mozart, Schubert, Wagner and Liszt.\n\n"}

The game's plot concerns an apprentice Shaper and an Agent (whose name is Shanti), both members of a secretive sect of wizards who can create life by using their own life energy. They are sent on a mission to investigate a failing Shaper colony called Drypeak. When they arrive not all is well, the player becomes drawn into a four-way war which has been hidden from the outside world.\n\nThe game's development was made more simple by the use of the same game engine to that of its predecessor, though extra dialogue was involved due to the presence of four factions rather than the three in \"Geneforge\". Video game journalists awarded both positive and average review scores, they were impressed by \"Geneforge 2\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s plot and replayability but criticized the game's graphics and ambient sound effects.\n\n\"Geneforge 2\" is a role-playing game where the player's choice of answers during conversations with non-player characters affects how the player is regarded amongst the game's four factions. The player character is an apprentice Shaper, a feared and secretive group who can create life. Players create a character from one of three character classes and explore the area surrounding Drypeak, a failing Shaper colony, solving quests and gaining experience. Each of the three character classes has a particular playing style and can approach tasks in different ways. Guardians are fighters who excel in standard combat skills, especially hand-to-hand fighting. They are capable of shaping creations, but have little affinity for magic. Agents are the game's version of rogues, and excel in spell casting and are capable of hand-to-hand combat. The Shaper is a summoner, capable of creating living creatures by using their own life essence. Shapers rely on their creations for protection. Players can also convince certain non-player characters to join them.\n\nThe game is played in 45° axonometric perspective, movement through the game's environs is real-time, combat is turn-based. The game world is divided into 84 areas accessible through a world map. Clearing areas by defeating leaders or successfully traversing the terrain allows players to bypass those areas via the world map, reducing travelling time. The game uses an auto-map, each area is completely darkened and is revealed as the player explores, similar to the fog of war used in real-time strategy games. As the player completes tasks and defeats enemies they receive experience, leading to increased levels and additional skill points. The player character's skill points can be used to increase their statistics. Canisters which increase skills or add new abilities are scattered throughout the game. \"Geneforge 2\" offers a number of changes and additions over its predecessor. Three new creations are available to players: massive Drakons; telepathic Gazers; and acidic, decaying Rotghroths. Several new spells are available, such as Kill and Aura of Flames. The skill \"Anatomy\", which allowed the player to cause extra damage in melee combat, is replaced with \"Parry\", which has a chance of blocking incoming attacks. Also the spell \"Dominate\" which allows the player to take control of one of the enemies is replaced with \"Wrack\". The game engine itself, however, is essentially unchanged from the original \"Geneforge\".\n\nAn apprentice Shaper is sent on a training mission with a Shaper Agent named Shanti by the Shaper Council. The pair are tasked with assessing the failed Shaper colony Drypeak and making contact with the pair of Shapers, Barzahl and Zakary, who were dispatched years ago to revitalize the colony. The gates of Drypeak are found unmanned, much to Shanti's disgust, the Agent and her charge are also attacked by rogue Shaper creations. When the pair gain access to the colony, they find a dishevelled Zakary who informs them that both he and Barzahl were unsuccessful in revitalizing the colony, which remains a barren desert. He also states that Barzahl has died. Zakary and the population of Drypeak behave suspiciously. Shanti is shadowed by an armed guard against her will. She instructs the apprentice, who is not guarded, to explore Drypeak and beyond in order to discover the truth behind the colony and Barzahl's disappearance.\n\nAfter exploring a number of the game's locations, the apprentice gains access to a guarded tunnel and is astonished to discover what lies on the other side. Whereas the valley where Drypeak is located is a dustbowl devoid of vegetation, the lands on the other side of the tunnel are lush and green, meaning highly illegal shaping is taking place in secret. Serviles, the Shapers' slaves created from life essence, show abnormal intelligence and self-awareness. While still reeling from the revelation of what lies beyond Drypeak, the Shaper apprentice discovers that Shanti has disappeared during one of her escapes from her armed escorts, her necklace lay broken on the grass outside the tunnel. At this point, approximately a quarter of the way through the game, the player's choices expand considerably.\n\nWhen confronted with the apprentice's findings, Zakary confesses to being part of a plot to conceal illegal experiments from the Shaper Council. Both he and Barzahl were sent to Sucia Island, the location where the original \"Geneforge\" game is set, where Barred Shaper technology had allowed Shapers to manipulate life in countless ways. Instead of destroying the Geneforge, the pair agreed to spirit away the technology and experiment in private. Several of the intelligent serviles who lived on Sucia were brought along; a number of Shapers also followed Barzahl. Zakary remained in Drypeak to provide a front for the experimentation and rogue serviles which lay beyond the tunnel. Barzahl moved further into the valleys to build settlements and run experiments. Repeated use of the canisters can render the user cold, detached and possibly mad. When Zakary saw this happening to Barzahl the pair argued, Zakary regretted his part in the deceit. This occurred a year before the arrival of Shanti and the apprentice, Zakary had lost contact with Barzahl since the argument. Zakary pledges his loyalty to the Shaper Council once more and asks for help from the apprentice in dealing with what lies beyond the guarded cave.\n\nUsing the Geneforge to empower himself and his followers, the Barzites, Barzahl intends to bestow god-like abilities on himself and his followers within the city of Rising. Barzahl cut off contact with Drypeak, preparing to repel the inevitable assault of the Shaper Council, who they wish to remain independent from. The Takers, a faction of intelligent serviles who had originated on Sucia Island, were given powers by Barzahl because they worked for him. In turn the Takers created powerful dragon-like beasts called drakons, taught the drakons how to create life themselves, and betrayed Barzahl. The Takers stand for the total destruction of the Shaper Council. The Awakened, the other servile faction in \"Geneforge 2\", believe that Shapers should treat them as equals. They had been working with the Barzites, but the Awakened's leader Learned Pinner rejected the Barzites' view that serviles need to be controlled. Trade and communications between Zakary's now Shaper Council loyalist Drypeak and the other three factions have ceased, replaced with spies and subterfuge. The player is free to decide which faction they wish to join, if any, and to explore the game world, reacting to the characters and situations they encounter.\n\n\"Geneforge 2\" was developed in tandem with another Spiderweb Software title, \"Blades of Avernum\". Developer Jeff Vogel described the game's production as \"very relaxing\", since the game engine was already completed from the previous game he was familiar with it and therefore could devote his time to creating the game itself. Due to the different reactions the player receives from the factions, depending on their actions and conversation choices, it required days to complete a single town. This was further increased from the original game, due to there being four factions instead of three. In an interview held during the development of \"Geneforge 2\" Vogel stated \"I'm really excited about the Geneforge series. And we're already thinking about Geneforge 3.\" A 20 area demo version was released, allowing players access to towns, mines and woodlands.\n\n\"Geneforge 2\" received both positive and average review scores. Video game magazine \"PC Gamer\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s reviewer stated that \"graphics aside, Geneforge 2 is a terrific game\" for players new to the RPG genre. The reviewer of \"Computer Games Magazine\" praised the Spiderweb Software's titles and said that \"Geneforge 2\" \"is probably the best twenty-five bucks an RPG fiend can spend.\" CNET's staff member was more critical, describing the game as \"complex enough to keep you interested, but not quite good enough to enjoy.\" Indie gaming website Game Tunnel's Gianfranco Berardi praised \"Geneforge 2\" as \"an RPG of amazing quality.\" Inside Mac Games' Ken Newquist stated the game is \"a real find\" for players who have been disappointed by lack of gameplay in expensive mainstream titles.\n\nThe game's graphics and sound effects received a largely negative response, Matt Peckham of GameSpy described them as \"yesteryear\" and \"minimalist\" respectively. Ken Newquist called the graphics \"far from spectacular\" and stated they were worse than older titles such as \"Baldur's Gate\". He also highlighted that enchanted items look identical to their mundane counterparts and that highly evolved creatures are identical to their standard brethren. Newquist also disliked the ambient sounds, which make up the game's soundtrack, calling them \"numerous, but repetitive\". Gianfranco Berardi was more positive. He stated that \"the graphics aren't exactly top-notch\", but noted variation between different areas. He also said \"the sound effects and ambience simply added to the involving storyline.\" CNET's editor described the sound effects as \"merely adequate\" and the graphics \"less so\".\n\nGianfranco Berardi praised the plot, stating that it \"isn't just good background noise like in most games.\" He added that he found the plot involving, and that it can cause the player to stop and think about their actions. Matt Peckham described the plot as \"fantastic and original\", and praised the game's replayability. Ken Newquist compared the game's setting to the pen and paper role-playing game \"Gamma World\", and stated \"players get a huge world to explore and—thanks to the intricacies of the game's plot—re-explore.\"\n\n"}

The lands are split up into small areas, which can be traveled through using a world map. During combat, each warrior gets a certain amount of action points, which are spent moving, attacking, casting spells, and using items. At the beginning of the game, the player chooses a type of Shaper to be. The three types are Shapers, Guardians, and Agents. When the player gains a level, he or she gains an amount of skill points, which can be spent on improving one or more of the character's abilities.\n\nThe \"Geneforge\" game engine has been revamped in this sequel, debatably improving gameplay in some instances and making others more cumbersome to deal with. No new creations or spells are available to players in \"Geneforge 3\", however a number of different features have been added. For instance, there are two NPCs who will join the party, interject comments upon situations, and possibly leave if the player does something they disagree with. Their names are Alwan and Greta. There has also been a new forging system added, allowing players to create powerful artifacts or enhance existing items.\n\nUnlike the previous two games, \"Geneforge 3\" offers only two sides to choose from in the ensuing conflict. Players cannot get very far before being forced to choose a side, although they can change sides with some success fairly late in the game if they so desire, whereas the previous games were possible to complete without ever actually taking sides.\n\nThe player begins as an apprentice learning the arts of Shaping. While attending school on Greenwood Isle the player character is awoken when the school is attacked. Luckily, two Shapers are ready to join the shaper and assist to survive in the world outside.\n\nAlwan is a loyal Shaper Guardian who has only one skill, that of using his iron sword. He is trained as a Guardian, to obey without questioning. Due to there not being anyone he is able to obey, at first he is disoriented by the attack and does not know what to do. The player can get him to join only after obtaining permission from the servant mind in the school.\n\nGreta is a castout from the school because she started to sympathise with the Shapers' creations. She was an Agent, skilled in magic (starts with Firebolt but the player can get teachers to teach her other spells later in the game) and battle arts (also a sword). \nShe is living in the village, outside the school, that is aptly named South End. She consents to joining the player's group without any conditions.\n\nIt is discovered that a traitor Shaper named Litalia had orchestrated the attack on the school and other strikes against Shaper communities. She and others, including a former teacher at your school, believe that the Shapers are tyrannical rulers who make the lives of their creations miserable and should be stopped by extreme measures. The rebellion has been creating rogue spawners throughout the Ashen Isles, summoning creations that are causing chaos and attacking the Shapers and those who serve them. The player can choose between fighting for Litalia and her comrades, or allying with Lord Rahul and the Shapers and stifling the insurgency.\n\nIt is found that either Alwan or Greta will leave the player's group depending on which faction the player joins. Greta will leave if the player joins the Shapers due to her thinking that the player is inhumane and Alwan will leave if the player join the rebellion because he will think the player is disloyal.\n\n"}

Once upon a time the place was full of Champa and Chandan trees, which fragranced the whole forest. Due to such a beautiful place on earth, Lord Indra and Indrani went down from Heaven to stay here for a while. They deeply enjoyed the beauty of nature; while wandering in the jungle Indra went to a small village Sunabeda (Nuapada district), where he met with a beautiful girl Udanti.

All three members sang and composed. \n\nTheir sound was a complex filter of their favorite music, including early Pink Floyd, the Krautrock movement and early SST Records artists like Meat Puppets and The Minutemen.\n\nTheir first release was on the Nur Scheiss record label (Austria) and was titled \"He Went There So Why Don’t We Go?\" They were later signed to Shimmy Disc and released \"Across the Room and Into Your Lap\" in 1991, with Shimmy guru Mark Kramer creating the final mix from the band's master tapes.\n\nDuring their tour of Europe in 1991, an equipment driver coined the bizarre phrase “There Was an Elk!”.

The album was the band's shortest yet, focusing on social, political, and emotional issues that had appeared in prior works, especially \"Internationalist\".\n\nThe album produced four singles. The most successful, \"My Happiness\", reached #4 on the ARIA Singles Chart, won the 2001 ARIA Music Award for \"Single of the Year\", and topped Triple J's Hottest 100 in 2000. The album also featured \"These Days\", which topped Triple J's Hottest 100 in 1999.

The focus of the album was on restraint, with more simplistic lyrics than previously, and with a plain and simple message intended. Fanning said of his songwriting ethic: \"You try and make it something that’s got some substance, but also, you can never do that at the cost of it having relevance to what you’re singing.\" Powderfinger manager Paul Piticco commented that \"their ethos is to be pushing the limits of their songwriting ability\".\n\nLike Powderfinger's previous album \"Internationalist\", \"Odyssey Number Five\" commented on social and political issues heavily, with the primary point of focus being Aboriginal affairs. The lyrics of \"Like a Dog\" attacked former Prime Minister of Australia John Howard's Liberal government for its treatment of Indigenous Australians, and for breaking the \"relaxed and comfortable\" promise he made in the 1996 Australian federal election. Lead singer Bernard Fanning related this to the band's other ethical stances—refusing to appear on \"Hey Hey it's Saturday\", for its anti-gay commentary, or not allowing Powderfinger songs to be used in jingles, amongst others—stating, \"We're not here to set an example. We just want to be happy with ourselves and not end up with a guilty conscience.\" Fanning said that despite \"Like a Dog\" being about a political issue, it was not a political song, rather just Powderfinger \"voicing our opinions\". The band worked with boxer Anthony Mundine on the song's music video, whom Fanning praised as \"the perfect lead, in terms of what the song is about and the fact that he’s prepared to speak up for what he believes in.\"\n\nAs well as providing social commentary, \"Odyssey Number Five\" also discussed love, a recurring motif in Fanning's songwriting. Fanning noted that one of the causes of this was his passion for soul and gospel music, stating that he \"listen[s] to a lot of soul music that's unashamedly about love and how good it makes you feel\". Lead guitarist Ian Haug agreed, and also noted that the band as a whole were fully committed to Fanning's lyrics, stating \"It's really important for us to agree with what Bernard is singing.\"\n\n\"Odyssey Number Five\" marked Powderfinger's first successful attempt to enter the United States market. Fanning told \"Billboard\" in a 2001 interview that the band were not taking anything for granted, however, stating, \"In America, we haven't really done any work yet to deserve any major popularity\", with the \"vibes\" on previous albums failing to reach the American mainstream. Powderfinger toured extensively around the country, performing in 22 cities. As a result of these efforts, \"My Happiness\" was briefly placed on rotation on KROQ-FM and several other radio stations. The song ultimately peaked at #23 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. This success was assisted by the band appearing on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\", and by supporting Coldplay on tour. Guitarist Darren Middleton summarised their work in the United States by stating \"This year has been a bit of a blur.\"\n\n\"Odyssey Number Five\" was released on 4 September 2000, on the Grudge/Universal record labels. The album was released in the United Kingdom on Polydor, with 15 minutes of video and an additional track \"Nature Boy\", at a later date. A sampler version was released in the United States in 2001, containing five tracks.\n\nFour singles were released from the album. \"My Kind of Scene\" was the first; released as a promotional single in June 2000. The track was written for the 2000 film \"\", and appeared on its . Collins and Middleton recalled that the song was written and produced with photos of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman on the wall of the band's studio \"as inspiration\". They noted that the band made three songs in response to the \"Mission: Impossible 2\" request, and that \"My Kind of Scene\" was chosen over \"Up & Down & Back Again\" and \"Whatever Makes You Happy\".\n\nThe second single from the album was \"My Happiness\", released on 14 August 2000 in Australia. \"My Happiness\" entered the ARIA Singles Chart at #4, and spent 24 weeks on the chart, making it Powderfinger's highest charting single in Australia. It peaked at #7 on the New Zealand singles chart, and spent 23 weeks in the top 50. Furthermore, \"My Happiness\" was Powderfinger's first single to chart in the US, reaching #23 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart.\n\n\"Like a Dog\" was released as the third single on 15 January 2001. The song was heavy in political sentiment, akin to \"The Day You Come\" on \"Internationalist\". The riff for the song was written by Ian Haug, and the song's music video featured Australian Aboriginal boxer Anthony Mundine, and was based on the 1980 Martin Scorsese film \"Raging Bull\". Drummer Jon Coghill said the song revolved around the question of \"why the hell won’t John Howard say sorry to the Aboriginal people!\" \"Like a Dog\" spent one week on the ARIA Singles Chart, at #40.\n\nTwo songs from the album, \"The Metre\" and \"Waiting for the Sun\", were released as a double A-side to form the final single. The single was released on 21 August 2001, and included a cover of Iron Maiden's \"Number of the Beast\". \"Waiting for the Sun\" was written by Fanning as a devotional, gospel style song. He said of the song; \"It’s about being in a relationship and being really heavily happy with it.\" \"The Metre\" spent one week on the ARIA Singles Chart, at #31.\n\n\"Odyssey Number Five\" mostly gained positive reviews, and was more successful than its predecessor, \"Internationalist\". \"Entertainment Weekly\" reviewer Marc Weingarten gave the album a B+. He stated that album entered new \"terrain\" in guitar rock, complimenting the \"scratching and clawing guitars\", drawing comparisons to Travis (\"prim\") and Oasis (\"mock-grandiose\").\n\nAllmusic reviewer Dean Carlson disliked the album, giving it a rating of one and a half stars. He described it as \"little more than a slightly off-base perspective into the world of mid-90s American grunge\", and described it as highly similar to Neil Young. Despite this, Carlson's did praise the songs \"Odyssey #5\" and \"My Happiness\", stating that \"[t]oo often, Powderfinger is too earnest, a bit too careful in their career\". Carlson noted that despite his critique, the album achieved some success in the American market.\n\nDevon Powers of \"PopMatters\" complimented Fanning's vocals, and said the focus of the album was \"meaty, rolling ballads\". Powers said that many of the songs on the album were \"the kind of songs you put on repeat for hours, or days\". The main critique was for the \"faster numbers\", stating that \"Like a Dog\" \"sounds mostly a little bored\". The review concluded by noting that the best songs on \"Odyssey\" were those not available as \"fleeting radio singles and background music\".\n\n\"Odyssey Number Five\" won the 2001 ARIA Awards for \"Album of the Year\", \"Highest Selling Album\", \"Best Rock Album\", \"Best Cover Art\", and \"Best Group\". \"My Happiness\" won the award for \"Single of the Year\", while \"Like a Dog\" was nominated for \"Highest Selling Single\" and \"Best Video\". At the 2002 ARIA Awards, \"The Metre\" was nominated for \"Best Group\". The album was named \"Album of the Year\" by \"Rolling Stone Australia\" readers, with \"My Happiness\" taking out \"Song of the Year\" and Powderfinger receiving \"Band of the Year\".\n\nAll songs written by Powderfinger:\n\n\nPowderfinger\n\nProduction\nAdditional musicians\n"}

It features a solid iron or aluminum open deck cast iron sleeved block and aluminum/magnesium cylinder head.\n\n\nThis engine was also used in the Rover 618i, assembled in Swindon at the Honda facility.\n\nThis engine was used for the Honda Accord 1.8 VTS/VTE in Japan. Also found in the European Honda Accord VTEC S.\n\nThe F18B2 won the 1.8L category of the International Engine of the Year competition for 2000.\n\n\nThis engine series was used in the Accord, Ascot Innova and Prelude in Japan and Europe. The DOHC F20A was also derived from this engine \"(see below)\".\n\n\nThis engine also spawned many variants, according to market, but the specs remain largely similar.\n\nThe F20A5 is used in the CB3 and CB4 Chassis.\n\nThe F20A7 is only used in the USDM 1992-1993 Accord Coupé (CC1).\n\nUsed in the Honda Accord Coupe (CD9) (1994-1997) \nand the Honda Accord Aerodeck (CE2) (Wagon) (1994-1997)\nProduced for the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany, Switzerland and Luxembourg \n\nAll the models that came with the F20B3 had a 5 speed manual gearbox.\n\n\nThis engine series is similar to the F20A above, used in the Honda Accord CC7 (1993-1996) and CE8 (1996-1998) in Europe. Also the Rover 620i (1993-1999)\n\n\nThis engine is the low compression brother of F20Z1. This engine was used in the same models like F20Z1.\n\n\nThis engine series was used in the Honda Accord and Honda Prelude S. Aside from differences in tuning, these engines are substantially similar.\n\n\nThis engine was used in the 1994-1997 Honda Accord EX (1993 in JDM Accord models 2.2VTE, VTL & VTS) and the 1997 Acura CL. It was the first F-series engine to feature VTEC.\n\n\nThis engine was used in the European Accord known as the Honda Aerodeck.\n\n\nThe F22B2, F22B3, F22B6 and F22B8 are similar, though their exhaust headers vary between each.\n\n\nThis engine was used in the 1998-2002 Honda Accord LX, EX, and SE, LEV models, and in the Acura 2.3CL in North America.\n\nAcceleration 0- for the 4-cylinder models is improved (around the mid-9-second mark), with comparable fuel efficiency to its predecessor: /city and /hwy for LX and EX models with automatic transmissions. Emissions of Non-Methane Organic Gases (NMOG), also known as unburned hydrocarbons, produced during engine warm-up are considerably lower. The LX and EX engines produce less than 0.075 grams per mile, qualifying them for California LEV (Low-Emission Vehicle) status. In California, the Accord EX with the available automatic transmission will produce less than 0.03 grams per mile of NMOG, qualifying it as the first gasoline-powered vehicle to reach ULEV (Ultra-Low Emission Vehicle) status. The five-main bearing block is high-pressure die-cast from aluminum alloy. The walls of the block extend below the centerline of the crankshaft, which helps stiffen the bottom end. FEM (Finite Element Method) computer analysis was used to arrive at optimum thicknesses for the block ribs and walls in order to minimize engine vibration. Additional bottom-end rigidity comes from a larger, stronger bearing-cap beam that ties directly into the cylinder-block skirt. An aluminum-alloy stiffener has been added between the transmission case and the block, just behind the bearing carrier. The stiffener serves to tie the block and transmission together into a single, reinforced unit. FEM was also used to design this stiffener so that it would not only stiffen the area, but also help minimize high-frequency engine vibration. Finite-element analysis of the Accord's piston design by Honda engineers yielded a new ultra-short, lightweight skirt design, which is very rigid and resistant to vibration and piston slap. Like the V-6 engine the pistons are gravity-cast aluminum alloy and utilize full-floating wrist pins in order to minimize noise. The engine's drop-forged single-plane steel crankshaft and connecting rods have been designed to be stronger and operate with less friction, much like the V-6 components. The I-section, drop-forged steel connecting rods have a completely new design and are considerably lighter than their predecessors (475 g vs. 578 g), which helps to minimize vibration. Big end-bearing journal diameter has been reduced from . Rod thickness is down from and the bolt size is smaller. Like the V-6 rod bolts, those of the 4-cylinder engine are torqued to the plastic region of the bolt material in order to ensure a solid union between the bearing cap and the connecting rod. The engine block incorporates the Honda-designed second-order balance system that cancels the inertial forces common to large-displacement 4-cylinder engines. The system consists of two parallel shafts on either side of the crank-shaft, above its centerline. Driven by a toothed belt, the balance shafts rotate in same directions at twice engine speed. Eccentric weights built into the shafts generate inertial forces that counteract the second-order forces created by the motion of the pistons and connecting rods. This Honda system minimizes vibration in the entire rpm range.\nCylinder Head\n\nThe 16-valve, single-overhead-camshaft cylinder head features four valves per cylinder and pentroof combustion chambers. Individual valves are smaller and lighter in 4-valve heads, which allows the engine to be revolved to a higher rpm, helping to extend the engine's power range. Valve actuation is via rocker arms and a hollow, belt-driven single overhead camshaft. The single-over-head-camshaft design requires less under-hood space than the more conventional dual overhead camshafts normally used with 16-valve, 4-cylinder engines. The adoption of a sophisticated knock control system optimizes ignition timing and allows for a higher compression ratio (9.3:1 from 8.8:1). Unleaded regular fuel is specified.\nRevised Intake System\n\nThe intake system was simplified in shape to reduce induction resistance and noise. A larger twin-chambered air box designed to dampen resonant intake tract noise replaces the previous Accord's smaller, single-chamber damper. The new box is 10.7 liters in capacity, compared to the older unit's 8.2 liters. The larger box also eliminates the need for a second resonant-frequency damper and an additional side branch. The 2.3-liter Accord 4-cylinder engine intake manifold has been redesigned to add more power and lower emissions. The individual cast-aluminum runners have revised dimensions to better take advantage of the different air-flow characteristics of the 2.3-liter engine. A larger plenum chamber reduces induction noise and the incorporation of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) ports into the plenum, upstream of the throttle plates, eliminates the need for a separate fitting and port in each intake runner.\nLow Speed Operation\n\nDuring low-rpm operation, only one intake valve opens, allowing air and fuel into the combustion chamber. The other intake valve has only a slight amount of lift and its timing is staggered. As a result, the air-fuel charge drawn through the open intake valve undergoes a swirl effect. The swirl creates a stratified charge with a rich mixture near the spark plug for good light-off, and a progressively leaner mixture toward its periphery. This stratified charge, combined with improved EGR control, results in lower emissions especially during the critical warm-up period, and better fuel economy. Low-friction, roller-bearing rocker arms are used to help reduce friction and improve engine efficiency.\nEmissions\n\nNVH\n\nTransmission\n\n\nThis engine was used in the 1998-2002 Honda Accord ULEV models. It is substantially similar to the F23A1, but features ULEV certification with a slight reduction of power: with a maximum torque of . This engine has a different exhaust manifold, a more restrictive intake manifold, and a 32-bit ECU that uses an AFR (Air Fuel Ratio) oxygen sensor when compared to the F23A1.\n\nThis engine was used in the 1998-2002 Honda Accord DX, the 1998-2002 Honda Accord LXi in New Zealand and the 2002 Honda Accord LX VP (value package) in North America.\n\n\nThis engine was substantially similar to the F23A1. It was used in the 1998 Honda Odyssey, the 1998-1999 Isuzu Oasis, and EUDM Honda Shuttle.\n\nBore . Compression ratio: 9.3:1\n\nThis engine was used in the Honda Accord Type V (2001-2003). This was only made available for Europe.\n\nBore . Compression ratio: 9.3:1\n\nThis engine was used in the 1990–1993 CB3 and CB4 Honda Accord 2.0Si, Honda Prelude Si - SR JDM-EDM and Honda Ascot Innova.\n\nThis engine series was used in the 1997-2001 CF4, CF5, CF9, CL3 Honda Accord and Honda Torneo from Japan. It uses a DOHC VTEC cylinder head similar to the H22A found in the Prelude but was designed to comply with many countries' sub-2.0 liter tax. The automatic transmission versions received the lower hp version , as it was tuned for more mid-range torque than its manual transmission counterpart. The F20B manual version also utilized bigger cams, intake and throttle body from the H22 type S.\n\n\nThis engine was a radical departure from previous F engines, and only shared basic dimensions such as bore spacing. It was designed specifically for the Honda S2000 and shares some engineering with the Honda K engine. A long-stroke F22C1 variant was also produced.\n\n\nThis engine was a reworked version of the F20C, a new rod stroke ratio the redline was dropped to 8,000 rpm to produce better low end torque. The camshafts were also revised along with valve spring and retainers. All these changes increased the peak torque by 6% however the power output stayed the same.\n\n\nThis engine was used in the mk4 1992–1996 Honda Prelude Si in Japan. It is similar to the H23A.\nThe mk5 1997 Honda Prelude also used this engine in first years of manufacture sold as Si only in Japan.\n\n"}

{"id": "2224394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2224394", "title": "Gin Drinkers Line", "text": "Gin Drinkers Line\n\nThe Gin Drinkers Line, or Gin Drinkers' Line, was a British military defensive line against the Japanese invasion of Hong Kong during the Battle of Hong Kong in December 1941, part of the Pacific War.\n\nThe concept came from France's Maginot Line, built after World War I. The British believed the line could protect the colony from Japanese invasion for at least six months and even called it the \"Oriental Maginot Line\" (). The Japanese generals also believed the line would stop their advance until the scouts found out the line was very weak. For example, only 30 soldiers defended Shing Mun Redoubt in the Battle of Hong Kong. It had a capacity of 120 men.\n\nThe Line's name originated from Gin Drinkers Bay, a former bay in nearby Kwai Chung, New Territories (now reclaimed and part of Kwai Fong). It passed through Kam Shan, the Shing Mun Reservoir, Beacon Hill, Lion Rock, and Tate's Cairn, ending at Port Shelter in Sai Kung District. Its total length was 18 kilometers. Its key points were the stretch between Beacon Hill and Sha Tin Pass, and the Shing Mun Redoubt, the latter of which also housed command HQ for the Line.\n\nThe Line made use of the mountains north of the Kowloon Peninsula and was strategically important in preventing any southward invasion from the New Territories.\n\nConstruction lasted from 1936 to 1938. The Line was not a solid defensive line, but rather a series of defensive positions linked together by paths. Bunkers, concrete fortified machine gun posts, trenches, and artillery batteries were built along the line; however, this artillery support may have been insufficient.\n\nDefensive headquarters were located at Shing Mun Redoubt ( or ), which had an observation post (acting as headquarters of the redoubt) that could call artillery support from Mount Davis battery and Stonecutters Island Fort, and four pillboxes (PB400-403) fitted with Vickers machine guns and Bren LMGs. There were 1.5 meter deep defensive channels or trenches, named after the roads of London such as Charing Cross, to aid the English soldiers of the Middlesex Regiment.\n\nOn the morning of 8 December 1941, Japanese forces bombed Kai Tak Airport, wresting control of the skies from the British and initiating the Battle of Hong Kong. At noon, the Japanese advance guard crossed the Shenzhen River to invade the New Territories. The northern garrison fell back to the Gin Drinkers Line, destroying roads and bridges on the way to make it more difficult for the invaders. By dusk, the Japanese had taken Tai Po.\n\nThere were only three British Army battalions manning the Gin Drinkers Line: the 2nd Battalion, Royal Scots in the west, the 2/14th Battalion, Punjab Regiment in the centre and the 5/7th Battalion, Rajput Regiment in the east. It was hoped that they could hold for at least three weeks and inflict casualties on the Japanese.\n\nOn 9 December, Japanese advance scouts of the 228th Regiment headed towards Tai Mo Shan, and discovered that British defences were weak at \"225 High Ground\" near Shing Mun Redoubt and Shing Mun Reservoir. The high ground dominated all positions of the western portion of the Line. Therefore, the Japanese advanced a sneak attack.\n\nAt 21:00 that evening, the lieutenant in charge and ten elite soldiers began the sneak attack. Combat engineers successfully breached the barbed wire and destroyed bunkers. By 07:00 on 10 December, they had taken the high ground and 27 POWs, opening a breach in the Line. The success surprised Japanese commanders who had thought at least a month was required to break the British defences, and thereby diverted more forces from mainland China to boost manpower. They also thought that a premature breakthrough would lead to rear forces and artillery troops falling behind, but ultimately agreed to launch a general assault.\n\nJapanese forces then opened a two-pronged assault on the Gin Drinkers Line. By the next day, they had already claimed Kam Shan and Tate's Cairn. Major General Christopher Maltby knew that the position was untenable and at noon decided to withdraw the garrison to Hong Kong Island to preserve its strength, signalling the defeat of the Line. Defenders to the west of the Line began retreating towards the island at 20:00. The Rajput Battalion stayed behind as a rear guard, only retreating on the morning of 13 December towards Devil's Peak and Lei Yue Mun towards Hong Kong Island. This was also the final retreat of British forces from the Kowloon Peninsula.\n\nThe Gin Drinkers Line was and still is considered to be a complete failure. The line and the whole of Kowloon were abandoned by the British troops in just two days. There can be said to be three main reasons:\n\n\nMost of the Line's remains cannot be found. There are still some defensive structures left at Shing Mun Redoubt, and bunkers at Lion Rock, Tate's Cairn, and Port Shelter.\n\n"}
{"id": "2224397", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2224397", "title": "Muva", "text": "Muva\n\nThe Muva is a term coined by E.H. Ackermann (1950) for a folded supracrustal shallow water succession of quartzites and pelites in the Irumide Belt of Zambia. The \"Muva\" was first described by A. Gray (1930). \n\nThe sequence is interpreted as a 1.8 billion year old shallow marine to coastal sequence which includes dunal deposits (aeolian), beach sands, offshore sand deposits and deeper water pelitic sediments. The alternation of quartzite-pelite successions was interpreted to record transgressive and regressive phases of a coastline along the southern margin of the Bangweulu Block. The presence of these type of rocks is also seen in areas that have undergone marine transgression. \n\nIn the western coastline of the Indian peninsula the Jurassic strata show this character of undergoing a submergence owing to crustal disturbance on the surface of the ocean floor and lead to the presence of marl with limestone in shallow water areas. Such effects are widely observed along the western coastline of India in parts of Saurashtra (Gujarat) and the Salt Range of Rajasthan.\n\n \n"}

The son of Amway co-founder Richard DeVos, he served as CEO of the multi-level marketing company from 1993 to 2002. In 2006, DeVos ran for Governor of Michigan, but lost to the then-incumbent Democrat Jennifer Granholm. In 2012, \"Forbes\" magazine listed his father as the #351 richest person in the world, with a net worth of approximately $5.4 billion.\n\nDeVos is the husband of Betsy DeVos, the 11th and current United States Secretary of Education.\n\nDeVos was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the son of Helen June (Van Wesep) and Richard Marvin DeVos. DeVos is a graduate of the Forest Hills public school system.\n\nHe was involved in the family business, Amway, even as a child. \"I still remember when it was in the basement of our home when I was growing up,\" he later said. \"I remember the offices being down there and people working down there.\" As boys, he and his brother Doug were \"tapped as mini-hosts\", assigned to greet attendees at Amway's annual conventions, and they \"helped out with everything from clearing plates during gatherings to ferrying guests to play tennis or waterski. That evolved to speaking in front of groups and even giving product demonstrations.\" DeVos later said that \"It was kind of like a Junior Achievement atmosphere contained inside of Amway. ... We just hung around the company. It was your social activity.\"\n\nDeVos received a bachelor's degree in business administration from Northwood University. He later paid to attend, but did not complete, the Harvard Business School and the Wharton School's Executive Study Programs. DeVos has received honorary doctorates from Grove City College, Central Michigan University and Northwood University, as well as distinguished alumni recognition from Northwood University.\n\nHis wife, Betsy DeVos, is the former chairperson of the Michigan Republican Party and the Secretary of Education.\n\nDeVos began working with Amway Corporation in 1974, holding positions in various divisions, including research and development, manufacturing, marketing, sales, and finance. In 1984, he became one of Amway's vice presidents, with overall responsibility for the company's operations in 18 countries. Under his leadership, the company opened numerous new markets and tripled foreign sales to exceed domestic sales for the first time in company history.\n\nAccording to one source, \"When Dick DeVos became vice president of Amway's foreign operation in 1986, sales outside of the U.S. accounted for about 5 percent of overall sales. When he left the position six years later, they had grown to 50 percent of annual sales.\"\n\nWhen the DeVos family acquired the National Basketball Association's Orlando Magic basketball franchise in 1991, DeVos's father, Richard DeVos became President and CEO of the team. On October 21, 2005, it was announced that DeVos would become part owner as his father split ownership evenly between his children.\n\nLarry Guest of the Orlando Sentinel wrote in a September 1991 column that \"civic and business leaders in Grand Rapids\" considered DeVos \"admirable, amicable, compassionate, honorable, community-conscious, intelligent\", but that they wondered whether DeVos, who was about to begin running the Orlando Magic, was \"strong enough...to make the tough decisions necessary as the chief operating officer overseeing... an NBA franchise?\" Guest answered yes, calling DeVos \"a business and political specialist experienced far beyond his 35 years on this globe\" and noting that he had \"recently attracted more than a million votes, more than any other Republican on a statewide basis, to win a seat on Michigan's Board of Education.\" Guest quoted DeVos as saying that in making business decisions, he hopes \"to be seen as tough, but also fair... I'm not a control-oriented individual, but I expect results and I expect meticulous, detailed management.\"\n\nDeVos left his positions as President and CEO of the Orlando Magic in January 1993 to rejoin Amway as its President, succeeding his father, Amway co-founder Rich DeVos. Under Dick Devos, the firm expanded operations to more than 50 countries and territories on six continents.\n\nIn 2000, DeVos oversaw a significant corporate restructuring that created Alticor, the new parent company of predecessor Amway, as well as other subsidiary companies. In a 20-month span, Alticor cut over 1,300 jobs (primarily in Michigan) during this restructuring, with 400 of them being buyouts and early retirement.\nJob cuts were one of several cut backs made during the corporate restructuring of Amway in order to expedite the return to profitability and prevent further downsizing or the possible loss of the company.\n\nDeVos and his brother, Doug DeVos, are \"credited with taking the company global, and setting industry standards as they moved into those markets.\"\n\nDeVos retired as president of Alticor in August 2002. In that fiscal year, Alticor reported sales of $4.5 billion, primarily through its more than 3.5 million part-time sales force and its complementary e-commerce channel. After retiring from Alticor, DeVos returned to become president of The Windquest Group.\n\nThe Windquest Group is a privately held investment management firm with holdings in technology, manufacturing, and other sectors.\n\nA 2010 article reported on a Windquest venture called The Green Machine, which \"converts waste heat that's the byproduct of a manufacturing process – in liquid or gaseous form – into electricity.\"\n\nDeVos explained that \"Some time ago Windquest brought on a specialist in alternative energy. ... We knew this was going to be an important part of our future, but also an opportunity.\" He explained that sustainability is \"not just an environmental concept, it's also an economic one. If a particular business approach is not economically viable it will not be sustainable.\" Windquest was not interested in \"glitzy and glamorous\" ideas, he said, but in \"technologies that were environmentally sound and economically sustainable\" and thus more likely to be widely adopted. He expressed concern \"that some of the new products in the marketplace are either too dependent on tax incentives or subsidies\" and not genuinely \"viable and ...competitive\".\n\nThe Green Machine is produced by the ElectraTherm Company and distributed by Windquest in collaboration with Pro Services. \"It's a three-legged stool\", DeVos explained. \"ElectraTherm provides the core technology, Pro Services provides the installation ability and the knowledge of the customers' needs and Windquest then provides both financing and high-level business acumen.\"\n\nIn 1990, DeVos won election to the Michigan State Board of Education, and resigned two years into his eight-year term, citing his return to Amway as CEO as the reason. In 1996, DeVos was appointed by Governor John Engler to the Grand Valley State University Board of Control.\n\nDeVos and his wife became co-chairs of the Education Freedom Fund in 1993. The Fund provides private scholarships to low-income families in Michigan with wishes to attend schools of their choice. When the Children's Scholarship Fund provided $7.5 million to the Education Freedom Fund, the DeVos matched the grant, and their foundation covers all of the administrative costs of the organization.\n\nIn 2000, DeVos was the co-chairman of the \"Kids First! Yes!\" campaign committee, which sponsored a ballot-initiative that would have amended the Michigan constitution to allow vouchers and tuition tax credits for private K-12 education. The initiative lost, with 69% of voters opposing the measure.\n\nThe Dick and Betsy DeVos Foundation has also given money to groups like the American Education Reform Council, Choices for Children, and Children First America, in addition to funding Christian schools in the West Michigan area.\n\nOn June 2, 2005, at Mackinac Island, DeVos announced his candidacy for governor of Michigan. He is still considered to be the wealthiest man to run for statewide office in Michigan's history. As of October 27, 2006, the DeVos campaign had spent $39 million, of which nearly $35 million was DeVos's own money.\n\nAn article published on August 3, 2005, quoted DeVos as saying that the main issue for Michigan voters was the state's economy. \"We're fighting with Mississippi for the highest unemployment rate in the country. We have the lowest personal income growth, the lowest business start-ups in the country. We are the only state that has not moved to positive ground when it comes to actual numbers of jobs in the marketplace,\" he said. He also suggested that tourism \"is one of the businesses and industries that has a bright future for Michigan, and is exciting.\" Criticizing Granholm's economic policies, he said that in her place \"I would have sent a very different signal to the entire regulatory infrastructure of the state, and would have taken steps to make this state more business friendly.\" Granholm, he said, \"has talked about wanting business, but all of her actions and the actions of all the regulatory agencies and government agencies in this state have continued to create difficulties for business. I hear it from business people everywhere I go in this state.\"\n\nIn an interview given during the campaign, DeVos said: \"It's all about jobs. Jobs are the number one issue in Michigan right now. Our state does not have a climate for job creation. Job-killing taxes like the SBT (Single Business Tax) punish job makers for creating jobs, providing their employees with benefits, and investing in new technology. Taxes like the SBT and Michigan's personal property tax hurt manufacturers more than any other tax. They've got to go if we want to help manufacturing and bring jobs back to Michigan.\" He also spoke of the need to \"work on trade issues to make sure that Detroit's automakers can compete fairly both here in the United States and around the world.\"\n\nThomas Bray of RealClearPolitics reported on June 21, 2006, that incumbent Jennifer Granholm was \"in deep trouble,\" with DeVos surging \"to a 48–40 lead...in a Detroit News/WXYZ-TV poll.\" In other polls, the two candidates were \"in a dead heat,\" and, to some observers' surprise, DeVos was leading \"48–40 among union households.\" Bray's conclusion was that \"the DeVos ads are striking home with their message: that the Michigan economy is in a shambles, that Granholm has failed to develop a strategy to resurrect the state and that a hard-nosed businessman who owes nothing to anybody is just the guy to sort things out.\"\n\nAn October 2006 article in Human Events argued that the Michigan governor's race was \"shaping up as a classic style vs. substance confrontation,\" with Granholm, \"a charismatic and attractive former aspiring actress who can deliver a speech and charm a crowd with the best of them,\" representing style, and DeVos representing substance. While lacking Granholm's \"flashier qualities,\" DeVos's \"business background...ideally suits him to address the state's most vexing economic issues.\" The article noted that DeVos was interested in job creation in what was \"perhaps the least business-friendly state in the country.\" While Granholm argued that jobs had been moved to China and India, DeVos pointed out that \"Michigan jobs have...gone to Ohio, Indiana, and other states with less punitive tax policies, and this governor fails to recognize that.\"\n\nA November 3, 2006, article noted that DeVos's plan for turning around Michigan's \"economic stagnancy and increasing unemployment\" was called the TurnAround Plan. It called for action on four fronts: \"creating an attractive job climate, overhauling state government, diversifying the economy, and conquering the international marketplace.\" DeVos planned to create \"a pro-jobs tax structure while supporting small business growth to increase jobs,\" and described his credentials as follows: \"I've made tough decisions, I've turned around a struggling business, and I've helped an entire city turn around.\"\n\nHe also called for an increase in \"funding for secondary and higher education,\" for a streamlined health-care system \"that utilizes technology to reduce hospital errors by making medical records more efficient,\" and for \" strong anti-crime measures, specifically against child predators.\" The article noted that debates between DeVos and Granholm had \"done little to help either's cause, though they did have an effect on the polls,\" with support for both candidates dropping and the number of undecided voters increasing. \"Whether it has been Granholm's campaign morphing images of DeVos into President Bush, or DeVos's ads including compromising footage of the governor's speeches, neither candidate has found a way to gain an advantage.\"\n\nThe article also pointed out that \"newspapers have divided their support along party lines, with the Detroit Free Press endorsing Granholm and The Grand Rapids Press siding with DeVos.\" Among DeVos's supporters was Lee Iacocca, who had been actively campaigning for him. He had also received endorsements from the Michigan Chamber of Commerce and the Michigan Farm Bureau.\n\nOn November 7, 2006, DeVos was defeated by Democratic incumbent Jennifer Granholm by a 14-point margin. He congratulated the re-elected Granholm via phone after the results were in. Granholm was quoted as saying she \"admired his tenacity and his passion for Michigan\".\n\nAccording to a CBS reporter, DeVos's loss was widely attributed to his performance in his first televised debate with Granholm. \"Granholm went for the jugular talking about an investment he had in a nursing home,\" and \"DeVos's lackluster response opened the door that led to his eventual loss.\" Years later, DeVos said: \"I learned I needed to be better at expressing my opinions more directly and forcefully...My mother taught me to be respectful and polite, but sometimes I took that advice too far.\"\n\nIn October 2008, DeVos donated $200,000 to the PAC opposing Michigan State Proposal – 08-2 (2008). He is a major backer of the America First Action PAC.\n\nIn October 2012, DeVos engaged in a series of public debates with Teamsters president James Hoffa, son of that union's legendary leader Jimmy Hoffa. They argued about the role of unions, with DeVos taking the position that \"Workers and job creators, through hard work, ingenuity, sweat and risk-taking, literally made the strongest economy in the world and the greatest standard of living in history...The greatest generation...did not just win a World War, they labored shoulder-to-shoulder with fellow workers to create and sustain value-added enterprises.\" By contrast, \"big union bosses have engaged in cozy deals and political backroom dealings in order to advance their personal agendas, not those of their members,\" They focused especially on Michigan's Proposition 2, which would protect collective bargaining. \"The unintended consequences of Proposal 2 will result in a $1.6-billion annual tax hike,\" said DeVos. \"Since collective bargaining is a federally protected right, Proposal 2 is really about special interests.\"\n\nIn a \"New York Times\" article published in December 2012, Nicholas Confessore and Monica Davey reported that after President Obama's re-election, DeVos \"began dialing up state lawmakers in Lansing,\" telling them that it was time to pass a right-to-work law. \"If the lawmakers later found themselves facing recalls or tough re-election fights, Mr. DeVos told them, he would be there to help.\"\n\nThe legislators and Republican governor Rick Snyder \"rapidly approved the legislation and delivered a body blow to the labor movement.\" The \"Times\" article noted that the Devos family had given over $1 million to the Michigan GOP in 2012 and at least $2 million to a successful effort to defeat a proposal for a pro-union constitutional amendment. After that defeat, the DeVos family helped form the Michigan Freedom Fund to promote a right-to-work law.\n\nA Reuters article published in December 2012 noted that the Michigan right-to-work campaign had \"gathered momentum\" thanks to the involvement of DeVos and \"Ronald Weiser, former chairman of the Michigan Republican Party and ambassador to Slovakia under President George W. Bush...The wealthy businessman and the political guru both worked to persuade wavering Republican lawmakers by assuring them they would have financial support if they faced recall elections over right-to-work, as happened in Wisconsin.\"\n\nIn a talk given in Washington, D.C., in January 2013, under the auspices of the Heritage Foundation, DeVos discussed the passage of so-called \"Right to Work\" legislation in Michigan. \"Freedom to Work was simply the right thing to do,\" he said. \"By casting off the practice of forced unionization; Michigan now publicly declares to other states and in fact the world, that we embrace freedom for our workers, true equality in the workplace and that we are ready to compete with anyone, anywhere to create economic opportunity for our Michigan families.\" In his talk, he explained how the legislation was passed, praising Michigan's business community, certain legislators, and Mackinac Center for Public Policy for their role in its passage, and noting that it was important to propose the legislation at the right time, to give it the right name, to be prepared for backlash, and to bring it to a vote quickly.\n\nMSNBC reported in December 2012 that the Mackinac Public Policy Center, which had played a major role in the passage of right-to-work in Michigan, was funded mainly by the Charles G. Koch Foundation and the Dick and Betsy DeVos Foundation. Despite the national fame of the Koch brothers,\nnoted MSNBC, \"among Michigan power brokers, DeVos might well be the bigger name.\" Since losing his 2006 run for governor, he had \"worked to exert influence from the outside.\"\n\nDick DeVos is President of the Dick and Betsy DeVos Foundation, a Grand Rapids-area foundation that has donated millions of dollars to civic, artistic, religious, educational, community and free-market economic organizations since 1990. Among its grantees are Kids Hope USA; the Helen DeVos Children's Hospital; the West Michigan Aviation Academy; the Regional Air Alliance of West Michigan; Mars Hill Bible Church; Potter's House; Grand Rapids Christian Schools; the Thunderbird School of Global Management; Willow Creek Association; ArtPrize Grand Rapids; the Education Freedom Fund; the Hugh Michael Beahan Foundation; Children First America; Florida P.R.I.D.E; New Urban Living; Rehoboth Christian School; Calvin College; Princeton University; Davenport University; Grove City College; Hope College; Little Star Inc.; the American Education Reform Council; and Choices for Children.\n\nIn the fall of 2010, DeVos opened the West Michigan Aviation Academy, the nation's first aviation public charter high school.\n\nA March 2010 article reported that the idea for the school had been Betsy DeVos's. \"DeVos said she was thinking about the couple's interest in education and her husband Dick's love of flying. 'I said, \"Why don't you combine both of these passions—a passion for education, for kids and a passion for flying—in a school.\"'\" The academy is located on the grounds of the Gerald R. Ford International Airport. \"There are aviators all over this community,\" Dick DeVos told a reporter. \"It's fascinating how many aviators there are who have already expressed a desire to be involved with this program and to bring the aviation component to it. That is going to be a big job to weave aviation throughout the entire basic curriculum. We've made a commitment to do that.\"\n\nIn answer to the question of why it was a charter school, DeVos explained that \"Charter schools are available to everyone... A charter school is a public school and therefore there's no tuition. So every student would have the possibility of going to this school at no cost and we think that's very, very important—to reach across the entire West Michigan community to be sure that every child has an opportunity to attend this school.\" He added that \"This is the kind of school that I would have loved to have had if I was a kid.\" He told a reporter for the Grand Rapids Press: \"If you're the kind of person who can't help but look up when you hear a plane overhead, then you're exactly the kind of person who will love this school...I have just a joy of flying...The world is such a different place when you can see it from 5,000 feet. I want young people to experience something that might broaden their world.\"\n\nThe Dick and Betsy DeVos Foundation has supported ArtPrize, an art competition in Grand Rapids, since 2009.\n\nIn 2010 Betsy and Dick DeVos committed $22.5 million to the Kennedy Center Institute of Arts Management, which was thereupon renamed the DeVos Institute of Arts Management at the Kennedy Center. It offers \"practical training to arts managers and board members on stages of professional development in the United States and around the world\"; its centerpiece is the \"Capacity Building programs, which offer technical assistance to arts managers and their boards through seminars, web chats, and on-site consultations.\" The gift was the largest private donation in the Kennedy Center's history and part was to be spent on arts groups in Michigan hit hard by the recession.\n\nThe foundation has also given money to organizations that promote free-market economics, such as the Grand Rapids-based Acton Institute; the Heritage Foundation; and the Hudson Institute. Also the DeVos family has contributed much to Northwood University in Midland, Michigan. This includes various donations of scholarships, buildings and uncountable financial donations.\n\nThe Dick & Betsy DeVos Scholarship was established in 2008 by DeVos and his wife to\nsupport entering MA, MS, or MBA students at the Thunderbird School of Global Management, particularly those from developing nations.\n\nThe DeVoses have also established an annual scholarship, called the Betsy and Dick DeVos Scholars for Free Enterprise and Entrepreneurship Scholarship, which is awarded to students who wish to earn a BBA or combined BBA/MBA at Northwood University.\n\nAn account of the Grand Action project explains that while authorities in Detroit kept initiating \"one master project after another\" that was supposed to solve that city's problems, and that never did, Grand Rapids was different, because its \"business leaders painstakingly set goals, aligned with government officials, generated support, and empowered key players.\" DeVos was at the center of this effort. In 1991, he \"convened a group of more than 50 community and civic leaders to begin the process of revitalizing downtown\" under the name of Grand Vision, later Grand Action.\n\nPlans were made \"for an entertainment and sports arena and the expansion of local convention facilities.\" After conducting \"a feasibility and economic-impact analysis,\" DeVos worked with two local bankers to set the plan in motion. Among the fruits of this effort were a new sports arena, a new convention center, a new J.W. Marriott Hotel, the renovation of the Civic Theater (renamed the Meijer Majestic Theater), a new art museum, and a new civic gardens and sculpture park, two new satellite campuses for Grand Valley State University, and a new institute for biomedical research. \"It's this kind of planning, a continual reinvention with clear goals,\" wrote a CNN journalist, \"that has been lacking in Detroit.\"\n\nDeVos and his wife contributed money to help fund a $500,000, 18-month private study of Lake Macatawa pollution sources, according to a June 2011 article. The study would \"use DNA fingerprinting technology pioneered recently at Michigan State University to identify specific sources of E. coli in different areas of the lake. A second part of the study will look at sources of sediment and the contaminants it carries.\" \"We are fortunate to have skilled scientists, committed conservationists and highly qualified academicians in West Michigan addressing this problem,\" DeVos told the \"Sentinel\". \"Threats to water quality are threats to public health and safety, and the people of Holland cannot afford to wait until 2017 for action.\"\n\nDeVos is the author of the 1998 book \"Rediscovering American Values\". Published by E.P. Dutton, it contains a foreword by former President Gerald R. Ford. Publishers Weekly described it as follows: \"Drawing on inspirational anecdotes taken from a cross section of the population, he describes how people have bettered themselves both morally and in their careers by practicing such values as honesty, compassion, self-discipline, initiative, hard work, charity and forgiveness. An unrelenting optimist, DeVos is convinced that people can solve most of their problems by taking personal responsibility.\" The book was a \"New York Times\" best seller.\n\nIn September 2010, the Spectrum Health Foundation presented DeVos with its Art of Giving Award at its annual celebration of philanthropy.\n\n\nDeVos and his wife have four children: Richard Marvin (Rick) III, Elisabeth (Elissa), Andrea, and Ryan, and eight grandchildren. Their son, Rick, is the founder and chairman of ArtPrize, a world-renowned art competition in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\n\nDeVos and his wife have homes in Grand Rapids and Ada, Michigan. They also own three houses in Windsor, Florida, a development at the northern end of Vero Beach, 80 miles north of Palm Beach. They bought a lot there in 1997 and bought another one later. They now have a compound consisting of two houses, plus another house elsewhere in Windsor, where they spend several weeks a year. In addition, they have a vacation home in Holland, Michigan, on the shore of Lake Macatawa. DeVos bought the property from his father in 2009.\n\n"}

The year 1469 marks the birth of Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism. He was succeeded by nine other gurus until, in 1708, the \"Guruship\" was finally passed on by the tenth guru to the holy Sikh scripture, Guru Granth Sahib, which is now considered the living Guru by the followers of the Sikh faith.\n\nGuru (, ; , Punjabi: ਗੁਰੂ, IAST: \"guru\") is a Sanskrit term for a \"teacher, guide, expert, or master\" of certain knowledge or field. Bhai Vir Singh, in his dictionary of Guru Granth Sahib describes the term Guru as a combination of two separate units: \"Gu;(ਗੁ)\" meaning darkness and \"Rū;(ਰੂ)\" which means light. Hence, Guru is who brings light into darkness or in other words, the one who enlightens.\n\nBhai Vir Singh's definition provides further insight about Sikhism itself and explains why Guru Granth Sahib is considered the living Guru. The word Sikh is derived from the Sanskrit term \"shishya\"(Punjabi: ਸਿੱਖ) which means a disciple or a student. Thus, Sikhs have a student-teacher relationship with their Gurus since their teachings, written in Guru Granth Sahib, serve as a guide for them.\n\n"}
{"id": "2224425", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2224425", "title": "Battle of Aquae Sextiae", "text": "Battle of Aquae Sextiae\n\nThe Battle of Aquae Sextiae (Aix-en-Provence) took place in 102 BC. After a string of Roman defeats (see: the Battle of Noreia, the Battle of Burdigala, and the Battle of Arausio), the Romans under Gaius Marius finally defeated the Teutones and Ambrones. The Teutones and the Ambrones were virtually wiped out, with the Romans claiming to have killed 200,000 and captured 90,000, including large numbers of women and children who were later sold into slavery. Some of the surviving captives are reported to have been among the rebelling gladiators in the Third Servile War. Local lore associates the name of the mountain, Mont St. Victoire, with the Roman victory at the battle of Aquae Sextiae, but Mistral and other scholars have debunked this theory.\n\nAccording to ancient sources, sometime around 120–115 BC, the Germanic tribe of the Cimbri left their homeland around the North Sea due to climate changes. They supposedly journeyed to the south-east and were soon joined by their neighbours the Teutones. On their way south they defeated several other Germanic tribes, but also Celtic and Germano-Celtic tribes. A number of these defeated tribes joined their migration. In 113 BC the Cimbri-Teutones confederation, led by Boiorix the Cimbric king and Teutobod of the Teutones, defeated the Scordisci. The invaders then moved on to the Danube, arriving in Noricum, home to the Roman-allied Taurisci people. Unable to hold back these new, powerful invaders on their own, the Taurisci appealed to Rome for help.\n\nThe Senate commissioned Gnaeus Papirius Carbo, one of the consuls, to lead a substantial Roman army to Noricum to force the barbarians out. An engagement, later called the battle of Noreia, took place, in which the invaders, to everyone's surprise, completely overwhelmed the Legions and inflicted a devastating loss on Carbo and his men.\n\nAfter the Noreia victory, the Cimbri and Teutones moved westward towards Gaul. A few years later, in 109 BC, they moved along the Rhodanus River towards the Roman province in Transalpine Gaul. Another consul, Marcus Junius Silanus, was sent to take care of the renewed Germanic threat. Silanus marched his army north along the Rhodanus River in order to confront the migrating Germanic tribes. He met the Cimbri approximately 100 miles north of Arausio, a battle was fought and the Romans suffered another humiliating defeat. The Germanic tribes then moved to the lands north and east of Tolosa in south-western Gaul.\n\nTo the Romans, the presence of the Germanic tribes in Gaul posed a serious threat to the stability in the area and to their prestige. Lucius Cassius Longinus, one of the consuls of 107, was sent to Gaul at the head of another large army. He first fought the Cimbri and their Gallic allies the Volcae Tectosages just outside Tolosa, and despite the huge number of tribesmen, the Romans routed them. Unfortunately for the Romans, a few days later they were ambushed while marching on Burdigala. The battle of Burdigala destroyed the Romans hope of finishing off the Cimbri and the Germanic threat continued to exist.\n\nIn 106 the Romans sent their largest army yet; the senior consul of 106, Quintus Servilius Caepio, was authorized to use eight legions in an effort to end the Germanic threat once and for all. While the Romans were busy getting their army together the Volcae Tectosages had quarrelled with their Germanic guests, and had asked them to leave the area. When Caepio arrived he only found the local tribes and they sensibly decided not to fight the newly arrived legions. In 105 Caepio's command was prorogued and a further six legions were raised in Rome by Gnaeus Mallius Maximus, one of the consuls of 105, he led them to reinforce Caepio who was near Arausio. Unfortunately for the Romans, Caepio who was a patrician and Mallius Maximus who was a 'new man' did not get along. Caepio refused to take orders from Mallius Maximus who as consul outranked him. All this led to a divided Roman force with the two armies so far apart they could not support each other when the fighting started. Meanwhile, the Germanic tribes had combined their forces. First, they attacked and defeated Caepio's army and then, with great confidence, took on Mallius Maximus's army and defeated it too. The battle of Arausio was considered the greatest Roman defeat since the slaughter suffered at the battle of Cannae during the Punic Wars.\n\nIn 104 BC the Cimbri and the Teutones seemed to be heading for Italy. The Romans sent the senior consul of 104, Gaius Marius, a proven and capable general, at the head of another large army. The Germanic tribes never materialized so Marius subdued the Volcae Tectosages capturing their king Copillus. In 103, Sulla, one of Marius's lieutenants, succeeded in persuading the Germanic Marsi tribe to become friends and allies of Rome; they detached themselves from the Germanic confederation and went back to Germania. In 102 BC the Teutones and Ambrones moved into Gallia Transalpina (the Roman province in the south of Gaul) while the Cimbri moved into Italy. Marius, as senior consul, ordered his junior partner Quintus Lutatius Catulus to keep the Cimbri out of Italy while he marched against the Teutones and Ambrones.\n\nA quarter of a million Germanic and Gallic tribesmen, led by King Teutobod of the Teutones, had crossed the Durance river, east of where it entered the Rhône. They spread out for miles: there were about 130,000 warriors, as well as wagons, cattle, horses, and their women and children. With the Teutones, who made up the bulk of the invaders, were the Ambrones, who had around 30,000 warriors, making them second most numerous tribe in the coalition under Teutobod. Gaius Marius and his army had arrived some time earlier, Marius had used his time wisely; he had constructed a heavily fortified camp on a hill close to the river and stocked it with enough supplies to withstand a lengthy siege. The tribesmen tried to get the Romans to come out of their fort and fight them on even ground; they shouted insults and challenges, which Marius ignored. He was unwilling to give up a strongly defended position for a battle with an uncertain outcome. Marius let it be known throughout his camp that he intended to fight the barbarians, but on his terms, not theirs. The catcalls and challenges continued. \n\nA Teuton warrior even issued a challenge directly to Marius. The barbarian invited the general to join him in single combat. Marius mocked him by advising him that if the warrior desired death he should find a rope, fashion a noose and hang himself. The Teuton did not give up so Marius produced a veteran gladiator and explained to the barbarian that if he still lusted for blood he could try and slay the trained fighter for it was beneath Marius's station as a consul to reduce himself to a common brawler.\n\nAfter they failed to lure the Romans out they tried to wait them out, but Marius had anticipated this and his fortress was well stocked. Frustrated the tribesmen attacked the fort for three days. Assault after assault was launched at the Roman defense works, but the fortifications held and from these the Romans released a barrage of missiles, killing many barbarians and repulsing the rest. Still, the Romans did not come out and the tribal coalition decided to move on south toward Massilia, which they intended to plunder. It took several days for their entire wagon train to clear the area but, once they were out of sight, Gaius Marius followed, dogging them and waiting for an opportune moment to strike.\n\nMarius now started trailing the tribal coalition and camped alongside them, when ending each day's march he ordered his men to build a fortified camp with impressive defense works. After all the losses they took trying to take Marius's fortress on the Rhone the Teutones and Ambrones never tried to storm Marius's camp again. Marius was biding his time waiting for the barbarians to make a mistake. Fortunately for Marius, he was presented with a chance to take on part of the tribal horde when they entered the area of Aquae Sextiae.\n\nSeveral days after the Rhone, Marius's army camped near the Ambrones, who for some reason had decided to camp separately from their Teutonic allies, when a couple of army servants, fetching water from the river, ran into an unknown number of Ambrones bathing in the river. The bathing Ambrones, caught by surprise, called for their fellow tribesmen who were eating dinner and drinking in their camp on their side of the river. The Romans, working on their camp, heard the commotion and quickly grasped the situation. Marius's Ligurian auxiliaries, without orders from Marius, dropped their tools, took up their weapons and sprinted to their servants' aid. The Ambrones now formed a battle line and awaited the Ligurians. Many tribesmen were weighed down by food, half-naked from bathing or intoxicated.\n\nAfter forming their battle lines, the Ambrones started beating their swords and spears against their shields and chanting their battle cry: 'Ambrones!'. The Ligurians who were charging towards them had once been called Ambrones as well and also started to shout 'Ambrones!'. After reaching the Ambrones, the Ligurians also formed battle lines. They continued their shouting match for a while and then the battle finally ensued. While these events were taking place, Marius had formed up his legions and marched to reinforce his Ligurian auxiliaries. When the legionaries arrived at the battle, they cast their pila (the Roman throwing spear) into the Ambrones, killing several warriors or rendering their shields useless, unsheathed their gladius (the Roman short sword) and waded in. After the legions' arrival, the battle quickly turned into a rout. Marius's heavily armed, expertly trained soldiers easily overpowered the Ambrones and pushed them toward the river. The Ambrones suffered terrible losses while on the Roman side losses were very low.\n\nMarius did not allow a victory celebration for he knew the Teutones were still out there and feared a counter-attack. By the time the fighting ended, it was too late in the day to finish their fortified camp, leaving the Romans vulnerable. Marius sent a detachment of troops into the woods to create a great noise to disorientate the barbarians and keep them from sleeping. This would also cause his enemies to be sluggish because of lack of sleep the next day. However, the night and the succeeding few days passed without incident, much to Marius' relief.\n\nWhile waiting, Marius sent one of his legates, Claudius Marcellus, with 3,000 troops some distance away and ordered him to remain undetected until a determined time when he would appear at the enemy rear.\n\nSince the Teutones were waiting for him on the plain near Aquae Sextiae, Marius had the opportunity to reconnoiter the area and select a suitable site for the upcoming battle. Four days after slaughtering the Ambrones, Marius marched his army onto the plain and took position on the high ground. He instructed his legionaries to stand their ground on the hill, launch javelins, draw their swords, guard themselves with their shields and thrust the enemy back. He assured his men that, since the barbarians would be charging uphill, their footing would be unsure and they would be vulnerable.\n\nMarius ordered his camp servants and all other non-combatants to march with the army. He also ordered his beasts of burden to be fashioned as cavalry horses. All of this was to create the illusion his forces were larger than they really were. He wanted the barbarians to hold back more of their warriors in reserve so his real forces would not be overwhelmed by the tribesmen's numbers.\n\nThe surviving Ambrones and the Teutones, bent on revenge, eagerly awaited the upcoming confrontation and, when the Romans finally showed themselves on the Aquae Sextiae plain, charged uphill. The Romans unleashed a barrage of javelins, killing or maiming many tribesmen, then stood in close order, drew their swords and awaited the enemy at the top of the hill. Roman strategy, discipline and training asserted itself and the tribesmen were unable to dislodge the legions from their superior position. The battle continued for much of the morning, with neither side gaining the upper hand. However, the well-conditioned and disciplined legionaries slowly and systematically forced the tribal horde down the hill until both the Romans and barbarians were on level ground. This is when Claudius Marcellus and his 3,000 men loudly and viciously attacked the enemy rear. The Ambrones and Teutones were now being attacked on two fronts and confusion set in, they broke ranks and started to flee, but there was no haven to be found for most of them. The Romans relentlessly pursued them. By the end of the afternoon, most of the barbarian warriors were dead or captured. Estimates vary from 100,000 to 200,000 being slain or captured. Teutobod, the Teutonic king, and 3,000 warriors escaped the battle only to be caught by the Sequani who handed them over to Marius.\n\nMarius sent a Manius Aquillius with a report to Rome. It said that 37,000 superbly trained Romans had succeeded in defeating over 100,000 Germans in two engagements.\n\nThere were around 17,000 surviving warriors and many thousands of women and children who were to be sold into slavery. Roman historians recorded that 300 of the captured women committed mass suicide, which passed into Roman legends of Germanic heroism (cf Jerome, letter to Ageruchia cxxiii.8, 409 AD ):\n\nThe proceeds from the sale of slaves usually went to the commanding General, but in this case, Marius decided to donate the profits from the sale to his soldiers and officers. This, of course, made him even more popular than he already was with his men.\n\nUpon hearing the news, Rome went wild with relief. Finally one of their generals had defeated the Germans. Gaius Marius, as an act of gratitude, was again voted Senior Consul \"in absentia\", with his legate Manius Aquillius as his Junior Consul. The Senate also voted for a three-day Thanksgiving; the people voted him two days more.\n\nThe following year (101) Marius and the proconsul Catullus Caesar defeated the Cimbri at the battle of Vercellae, ending the German threat.\n\nThe inhabitants of Massalia, some 23 Roman miles, 30 kilometres, distant, used the bones of the fallen tribesmen to erect fences to protect their crops. The decaying corpses left the soil enriched, and for years to the region experienced extraordinary harvests largely thanks to thousands of rotting bodies fertilizing the farmers' lands.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Bisciotti (born April 10, 1960) is an American business executive and the current majority owner of the Baltimore Ravens of the NFL. He founded Aerotek, the largest privately owned staffing and recruiting company in the U.S. based in Hanover, Maryland, and cofounded Allegis Group, an international talent management firm headquartered in Hanover, Maryland that owns Aerotek; TEKsystems; MarketSource; Major, Lindsey & Africa; Aston Carter; and Allegis Global Solutions.\n\nBisciotti was born on April 10, 1960 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the youngest of three children in a middle class Italian-American family. In 1961, his parents, Bernard and Patricia Bisciotti, moved the family to Severna Park, Maryland, a suburb of Baltimore, for his father's job as a construction sales executive.\n\nAs a child, Bisciotti often went with his family to Baltimore Orioles and Colts games. When he was 8 years old, his father died of leukemia. After his father's death, his maternal grandfather, C. Gordon Johnston, a retired regional district salesman for Ford Motor Co., supported the family.\n\nBisciotti attended the Severn School but left after two years and transferred to Severna Park High School. In his senior year, he played on the football team, though he has said \"I wasn’t much of a high school athlete, but played football, baseball, and basketball all the time when I was growing up\".\n\nIn 1982, Bisciotti graduated from Salisbury State University in Maryland with a degree in liberal arts. A year later, at 23, he and his cousin Jim Davis started Aerotek, a staffing company in the aerospace and technology sectors. Running the company out of a basement office with secondhand equipment, Bisciotti and Davis produced $1.5 million in sales in the first year. Aerotek grew into the Allegis Group, which is now the largest privately held staffing firm in the world. Bisciotti's involvement in the sports business has brought more attention to his once low-profile company.\n\nOn March 27, 2000, NFL owners approved the sale of 49% of the Ravens to Bisciotti. In the deal, he had an option to purchase the remaining 51% for $325 million in 2004 from Art Modell. On April 9, 2004 the NFL approved his purchase of the majority stake in the club.\n\nOne of the first projects Bisciotti directed as owner of the Ravens was to build the team's state-of-the-art training and practice facility, dubbed \"The Castle,\" which opened in October 2004.\n\nBisciotti fired Brian Billick after the 2007 season, although Billick's eight years as the Ravens' head coach included the team's win in Super Bowl XXXV. He then surprised many observers by selecting John Harbaugh as his new coach, despite Harbaugh's peak of previous experience being a single year as a defensive backs coach after several successful years as the special teams coach for the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nIn 2012, the Baltimore Ravens capitalized off a 10-6 season to go on to win Super Bowl XLVII against the San Francisco 49ers on February 3, 2013.\n\nIn 2005, Bisciotti ranked 378 among the Forbes 400, a list of the richest Americans.\n\nIn 2009, Aerotek, the company Bisciotti co-founded, reached a $1.2 million settlement in a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of more than 1,000 Aerotek workers who worked at a Verizon Internet Services call center in Martinsburg, West Virginia, which was closed in December 2006. The company then was sued to settle claims that the workers were not paid in a timely fashion for accrued personal time and were not paid all of the wages that were due in accordance with the West Virginia Wage Payment and Collection Act and Fair Labor Standards Act, according to Berkeley County Circuit Court records.\n\nBisciotti is Roman Catholic and on a board member for the Associated Catholic Charities and Mother Seton Academy. He and his wife Renee (Foote) Bisciotti have two sons. The family lives on the Point Field Landing of the Severn River in Maryland.\n\nIn addition to owning the Ravens, valued at $2.7 billion in 2019; Bisciotti also owns a $20 million yacht named “Winning Drive” and 2 Dassault Falcon private jets.\n"}
