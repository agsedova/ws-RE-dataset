{"id": "1895791", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1895791", "title": "Washington Street (Boston)", "text": "Washington Street (Boston)\n\nWashington Street is a street originating in downtown Boston, Massachusetts that extends southwestward to the Massachusetts–Rhode Island state line. The majority of it was built as the Norfolk and Bristol Turnpike in the early 19th century. It is the longest street in Boston, and it remains one of the longest streets in the state of Massachusetts.\n\nWashington Street serves as a divide where a number of cross streets in Boston change name.\n\nWashington Street, as it eventually became named, was the first road to connect the small peninsular town of Boston to the mainland, carrying the Boston Post Road to New York City. The name was first given to a section of this road in Boston from the border with Roxbury (which was then a separate town) to the fortification (near present-day East Berkeley Street), in honor of George Washington who rode through it during his tour of New England in October 1789.\n\nWashington Street was extended on July 6, 1824 to include the northward continuation of this road to Dock Square. This replaced other names that had been in use along this part of the road since 1706:\n\nThen in Roxbury, the name Washington Street was given on May 9, 1825 to the southward continuation of this road (laid out in 1662) from the town line with Boston to the present-day Roxbury Street in Dudley Square.\n\nFor a period of time afterwards, Washington Street extended westward from Dudley Square to the border with Brookline. Part of this extension (from present-day Columbus Avenue to the Brookline border) was renamed Tremont Street on July 2, 1860. Then the remaining part from Dudley Square was renamed Roxbury Street on June 16, 1874—and at the same time, Washington Street was extended southwestward from Dudley Square along the Norfolk and Bristol Turnpike to Rhode Island. The only location where Washington Street deviated from the path of the turnpike was south of downtown Dedham, bypassing what is now School Street and Court Street.\n\nIn Boston, Washington Street was extended northward along a new road to Haymarket Square on November 6, 1872. (This extension would later be overtaken by the redevelopment of Haymarket Square and Scollay Square, which became Government Center.)\n\nCharlestown Street, which began in Haymarket Square (where Washington Street ended) and continued northward to the Charlestown Bridge, was renamed North Washington Street on March 1, 1901. The name of the bridge itself was changed to North Washington Street on February 10, 1910.\n\nThe first state highway in Boston was the part of Washington Street from Dedham to West Roxbury Parkway (at Lagrange Street). It was taken over by the Massachusetts Department of Public Works in 1908. The short piece in West Roxbury Parkway, to just north of the road through the parkway, was taken over in 1921; the next state highway in Boston was the Southern Artery in 1926.\n\nThe turnpike was established in 1803 as a straighter alternative to two roads between Boston and Providence: the Lower Boston Post Road (via Norwood and Foxborough), and the road via Walpole and Wrentham. It ran from Dudley Square to the border of Rhode Island and beyond to downtown Pawtucket. The turnpike was constructed as an entirely new road, except for a part through North Attleborough (which is the only part bypassed today by US 1). The southern half of the turnpike, which had some steep grades and bypassed towns where travelers wanted to stop, saw little use and remained a dirt road until the construction of US 1. The part of the turnpike within the Roxbury limits was laid out as a public road in June 1857 and named Shawmut Avenue, as an extension of the existing Shawmut Avenue from Boston. The adjacent part of the turnpike within West Roxbury was named Shawmut Avenue as well on February 3, 1858.\n\nWashington Street begins at State and Court Streets as a one-way thoroughfare (for northbound traffic only). Through Downtown Crossing, from Milk Street south to Temple Place, Washington Street is closed to most vehicular traffic (and continues to be one-way northbound for authorized traffic only). South of Temple Place, Washington is, once again, one-way northbound, becoming two-way at Stuart Street and Kneeland Street. From Marginal Street, south to East Berkeley Street, including the bridge over the Massachusetts Turnpike and the adjacent Amtrak/Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority (MBTA) commuter rail tracks, the road is also one-way northbound, with a southbound contra-flowing bus lane for the Silver-Line bus.\n\nAt Dudley Square in Roxbury, Washington Street is southbound-only for several blocks, between Warren Street and Dudley Street. Northbound traffic bypasses this section to the east using those two streets. Just after passing under the Arborway in Jamaica Plain, Washington Street becomes Hyde Park Avenue, and traffic staying on Washington Street must turn west on Ukraine Way to cross over the Amtrak/MBTA Commuter Rail tracks, and then south at South Street, which becomes Washington Street again.\n\nSouthbound traffic must use short sections of South Street and Poplar Street at Roslindale Square. South of there, near the border between Roslindale and West Roxbury, Washington Street crosses West Roxbury Parkway and acquires a median strip. This median lasts until just before the Dedham city line, where the road continues as an undivided road.\n\nWashington Street continues southwestward, through the center of Dedham, the outskirts of Westwood, the centers of Norwood, and East Walpole and South Walpole. At the Walpole–Foxborough line, it no longer crosses the railroad tracks (the old Mansfield and Framingham Railroad), and traffic must detour via Water Street and North Street. North Street connects to the Boston-Providence Turnpike, which carries US Route 1 (and was never actually a turnpike, a toll road). This road merges into the old path of Washington Street south of the railroad. From there to Rhode Island, except through North Attleborough center (which it bypasses using East Washington Street as opposed to North and South Washington Streets), US Route 1 stays with Washington, as it passes through the outskirts of Foxborough (past Gillette Stadium), Wrentham and Plainville, and then through South Attleboro.\n\nWashington Street currently has the following route numbers:\n\nWhen the first numbered highways in Massachusetts, the New England Interstate Highways, were assigned in 1922, NE 1 used Washington Street through North Attleborough center and from Norwood center to Arborway in Boston. By 1927, US 1 (as the road was now known) split in Dedham center onto Court Street, using Ames Street and Bridge Street into Boston, where it used Spring Street and Centre Street to reach Arborway.\n\nSoon after 1933, the new road (Boston-Providence Turnpike and Brook Farm Parkway) from Roslindale to Foxborough was finished, and it was around this time that the rest of the current alignment to Rhode Island was finished — using Washington Street from Foxborough to the state line, except through North Attleborough center. The old road became Route 1A north from North Attleborough center and through South Attleboro, ending at the rotary just north of Dedham center. For several years in between, the new road was only built south of Dedham, and US 1 once again used Washington Street from Dedham into West Roxbury, where it cut north to Centre Street via West Roxbury Parkway.\n\nBetween 1949 and 1961, 1A was truncated to end at US 1 via Elm Street south of Dedham center, probably to keep traffic out of Dedham center. US 1 was removed from that alignment in 1989, but 1A still ends at the old route.\n\nAs a main road, Washington Street has had its share of streetcar and later bus routes. It also had the Washington Street Elevated from south of downtown to Dudley and later Forest Hills. An shows horsecar tracks from Boylston Street south to Dudley Street. An 1874 map extends them south from Dudley to just north of Forest Hills, and north to Dock Square. By 1888, tracks also used Washington north to Haymarket Square, and by 1897 all the way to and over the Charlestown Bridge. \n\nAs the West End Street Railway electrified its lines in the late 19th century, Tremont Street was the first north-south arterial in downtown Boston to run electric streetcars. As the lines on Warren Street (December 28, 1889), Blue Hill Avenue (January 18, 1890), and Hampden Street (May 10, 1890) were electrified, they initially used Shawmut Avenue to reach Tremont Street. On September 2, 1890, the line on Washington Street to began electric operation, again using Shawmut Avenue north of Dudley Square. On November 28, 1891, the downtown Washington Street tracks were electrified, with the five Warren Street, Hampden Street, and Blue Hill Avenue routes rerouted to Washington Street. This relieved congestion on the Tremont Street tracks and allowed increases in service.\n\nA later, , shows that tracks owned by the West Roxbury and Roslindale Street Railway continued southwest from Forest Hills via Dedham to Norwood. The Norfolk Southern Street Railway left Norfolk on the road to Walpole center, but used Washington Street from Common Street in Walpole to South Walpole. Except for the older section through North Attleborough center, used by the Interstate Consolidated Street Railway, none of the rest had streetcar tracks, due to its avoidance of populated areas. In still shows streetcar tracks on Washington Street within Boston, ending downtown at Essex Street. By 1953 they were only in use from Forest Hills to Egleston (by the 40 route, bus substituted December 18, 1955) and from Dudley to Northampton Street (by the 47 route, bustituted September 13, 1953, and the 10 route, bus substituted December 5, 1953).\n\nThe Washington Street Elevated, later part of the Orange Line, opened from south of downtown Boston to Dudley on June 10, 1901, and south to Forest Hills November 22, 1909. The Washington Street Tunnel downtown opened November 30, 1908. The Elevated closed on April 30, 1987, with the opening of the Southwest Corridor several days later.\n\nThere are two significant and two minor streets in Boston with the same name. Addresses at these streets need to be distinguished by neighborhood names or ZIP codes.\n\nFormer tenants\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1895800", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1895800", "title": "Riemann series theorem", "text": "Riemann series theorem\n\nIn mathematics, the Riemann series theorem (also called the Riemann rearrangement theorem), named after 19th-century German mathematician Bernhard Riemann, says that if an infinite series of real numbers is conditionally convergent, then its terms can be arranged in a permutation so that the new series converges to an arbitrary real number, or diverges.\n\nAs an example, the series 1 – 1 + 1/2 – 1/2 + 1/3 – 1/3 + ... converges to 0 (for a sufficiently large number of terms, the partial sum gets arbitrarily near to 0); but replacing all terms with their absolute values gives 1 + 1 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/3 + ... , which sums to infinity. Thus the original series is conditionally convergent, and can be rearranged (by taking the first two positive terms followed by the first negative term, followed by the next two positive terms and then the next negative term, etc.) to give a series that converges to a different sum: 1 + 1/2 – 1 + 1/3 + 1/4 – 1/2 + ... = ln 2. More generally, using this procedure with \"p\" positives followed by \"q\" negatives gives the sum ln(\"p\"/\"q\"). Other rearrangements give other finite sums or do not converge to any sum.\n\nA series formula_1 converges if there exists a value formula_2 such that the sequence of the partial sums\n\nconverges to formula_2. That is, for any \"ε\" > 0, there exists an integer \"N\" such that if \"n\" ≥ \"N\", then\n\nA series converges conditionally if the series formula_1 converges but the series formula_7 diverges.\n\nA permutation is simply a bijection from the set of positive integers to itself. This means that if formula_8 is a permutation, then for any positive integer formula_9 there exists exactly one positive integer formula_10 such that formula_11 In particular, if formula_12, then formula_13.\n\nSuppose that formula_14 is a sequence of real numbers, and that formula_15 is conditionally convergent. Let formula_16 be a real number. Then there exists a permutation formula_8 such that\n\nThere also exists a permutation formula_8 such that\n\nThe sum can also be rearranged to diverge to formula_21 or to fail to approach any limit, finite or infinite.\n\nThe alternating harmonic series is a classic example of a conditionally convergent series:\n\nis convergent, while\n\nis the ordinary harmonic series, which diverges. Although in standard presentation the alternating harmonic series converges to ln(2), its terms can be arranged to converge to any number, or even to diverge. One instance of this is as follows. Begin with the series written in the usual order,\n\nand rearrange the terms:\n\nwhere the pattern is: the first two terms are 1 and −1/2, whose sum is 1/2. The next term is −1/4.\nThe next two terms are 1/3 and −1/6, whose sum is 1/6. The next term is −1/8.\nThe next two terms are 1/5 and −1/10, whose sum is 1/10.\nIn general, the sum is composed of blocks of three:\n\nThis is indeed a rearrangement of the alternating harmonic series: every odd integer occurs once positively, and the even integers occur once each, negatively (half of them as multiples of 4, the other half as twice odd integers). Since\n\nthis series can in fact be written:\n\nwhich is half the usual sum.\n\nAn efficient way to recover and generalize the result of the previous section is to use the fact that\n\nwhere \"γ\" is the Euler–Mascheroni constant, and where the notation o(1) denotes a quantity that depends upon the current variable (here, the variable is \"n\") in such a way that this quantity goes to 0 when the variable tends to infinity.\n\nIt follows that the sum of \"q\" even terms satisfies\n\nand by taking the difference, one sees that the sum of \"p\" odd terms satisfies\n\nSuppose that two positive integers \"a\" and \"b\" are given, and that a rearrangement of the alternating harmonic series is formed by taking, in order, \"a\" positive terms from the alternating harmonic series, followed by \"b\" negative terms, and repeating this pattern at infinity (the alternating series itself corresponds to , the example in the preceding section corresponds to \"a\" = 1, \"b\" = 2):\n\nThen the partial sum of order (\"a\"+\"b\")\"n\" of this rearranged series contains positive odd terms and negative even terms, hence\n\nIt follows that the sum of this rearranged series is\n\nSuppose now that, more generally, a rearranged series of the alternating harmonic series is organized in such a way that the ratio between the number of positive and negative terms in the partial sum of order \"n\" tends to a positive limit \"r\". Then, the sum of such a rearrangement will be\n\nand this explains that any real number \"x\" can be obtained as sum of a rearranged series of the alternating harmonic series: it suffices to form a rearrangement for which the limit \"r\" is equal .\n\nFor simplicity, this proof assumes first that \"a\" ≠ 0 for every \"n\". The general case requires a simple modification, given below. Recall that a conditionally convergent series of real terms has both infinitely many negative terms and infinitely many positive terms. First, define two quantities, formula_37 and formula_38 by:\n\nThat is, the series formula_40 includes all \"a\" positive, with all negative terms replaced by zeroes, and the series formula_41 includes all \"a\" negative, with all positive terms replaced by zeroes. Since formula_1 is conditionally convergent, both the positive and the negative series diverge. Let \"M\" be a positive real number. Take, in order, just enough positive terms formula_43 so that their sum exceeds \"M\". Suppose we require \"p\" terms – then the following statement is true:\n\nThis is possible for any \"M\" > 0 because the partial sums of formula_43 tend to formula_46. Discarding the zero terms one may write\n\nNow we add just enough negative terms formula_48, say \"q\" of them, so that the resulting sum is less than \"M\". This is always possible because the partial sums of formula_48 tend to formula_21. Now we have:\n\nAgain, one may write\n\nwith\n\nThe map \"σ\" is injective, and 1 belongs to the range of \"σ\", either as image of 1 (if \"a\" > 0), or as image of (if \"a\" < 0). Now repeat the process of adding just enough positive terms to exceed \"M\", starting with , and then adding just enough negative terms to be less than \"M\", starting with . Extend \"σ\" in an injective manner, in order to cover all terms selected so far, and observe that must have been selected now or before, thus 2 belongs to the range of this extension. The process will have infinitely many such \"\"changes of direction\"\". One eventually obtains a rearrangement  . After the first change of direction, each partial sum of  differs from \"M\" by at most the absolute value formula_54 or formula_55 of the term that appeared at the latest change of direction. But converges, so as \"n\" tends to infinity, each of \"a\", formula_54 and formula_57 go to 0. Thus, the partial sums of  tend to \"M\", so the following is true:\n\nThe same method can be used to show convergence to \"M\" negative or zero.\n\nOne can now give a formal inductive definition of the rearrangement \"σ\", that works in general. For every integer \"k\" ≥ 0, a finite set \"A\" of integers and a real number \"S\" are defined. For every \"k\" > 0, the induction defines the value \"σ\"(\"k\"), the set \"A\" consists of the values \"σ\"(\"j\") for \"j\" ≤ \"k\" and \"S\" is the partial sum of the rearranged series. The definition is as follows:\n\n\nIt can be proved, using the reasonings above, that \"σ\" is a permutation of the integers and that the permuted series converges to the given real number \"M\".\n\nLet formula_60 be a conditionally convergent series. The following is a proof that there exists a rearrangement of this series that tends to formula_61 (a similar argument can be used to show that formula_21 can also be attained).\n\nLet formula_63 be the sequence of indexes such that each formula_64 is positive, and define formula_65 to be the indexes such that each formula_66 is negative (again assuming that formula_67 is never 0). Each natural number will appear in exactly one of the sequences formula_68 and formula_69\n\nLet formula_70 be the smallest natural number such that\n\nSuch a value must exist since formula_72 the subsequence of positive terms of formula_73 diverges. Similarly, let formula_74 be the smallest natural number such that:\n\nand so on. This leads to the permutation\n\nAnd the rearranged series, formula_77 then diverges to formula_61.\n\nFrom the way the formula_79 were chosen, it follows that the sum of the first formula_80 terms of the rearranged series is at least 1 and that no partial sum in this group is less than 0. Likewise, the sum of the next formula_81 terms is also at least 1, and no partial sum in this group is less than 0 either. Continuing, this suffices to prove that this rearranged sum does indeed tend to formula_82\n\nIn fact, if formula_83 is conditionally convergent, then there is a rearrangement of it such that the partial sums of the rearranged series form a dense subset of formula_84.\n\nIn Riemann's theorem, the permutation used for rearranging a conditionally convergent series to obtain a given value in formula_85 may have arbitrarily many non-fixed points, i.e. all the indexes of the terms of the series may be rearranged. \nOne may ask if it is possible to rearrange only the indexes in a smaller set so that a conditionally convergent series converges to an arbitrarily chosen real number or diverges to (positive or negative) infinity. The answer of this question is positive: Sierpiński proved that is sufficient to rearrange only some strictly positive terms or only some strictly negative terms.\n\nThis question has also been explored using the notion of ideals: for instance, Wilczyński proved that is sufficient to rearrange only the indexes in the ideal of sets of asymptotic density zero. Filipów and Szuca proved that other ideals also have this property.\n\nGiven a converging series of complex numbers, several cases can occur when considering the set of possible sums for all series obtained by rearranging (permuting) the terms of that series:\n\n\nMore generally, given a converging series of vectors in a finite-dimensional real vector space \"E\", the set of sums of converging rearranged series is an affine subspace of \"E\".\n\n\n"}

Only two were made.\n\nAlthough preceded by Enzo Ferrari's Auto Avio Costruzioni 815 of 1940, the 125 S was the first vehicle to bear the Ferrari name when it debuted on May 11, 1947 at the Piacenza racing circuit. Like the 815, but unlike its inline-8 predecessor, partly developed from Fiat engine components, the 125 S featured the a Ferrari designed and built \"Colombo\" V12 (the \"125\"), a trait it shared with most Ferrari cars of the following decades. The 125 S was replaced by the 159 S later in 1947.\n\nThe 125 S used a steel tube-frame chassis and had a double wishbone suspension with transverse leaf springs in front with a live axle in the rear. Hydraulic power drum brakes were specified front and rear.\n\nThe 125 S was powered by Gioacchino Colombo's 1.5 L (1497 cc/91 in³) 60° V12 with a bore/stroke of 55 x 52.5 mm . This engine produced 118 bhp (87 kW) at 6,800 rpm with a compression ratio of 9.5:1. It was a single overhead camshaft design with 2 valves per cylinder and three double-choke Weber 30DCF carburettors.\n\nA five-speed transmission was used in the 125 S as it was better able to exploit the power curves of the high revving V-12 better than a traditional four-speed gearbox.\n\nBoth of the two 125 S cars built in 1947 were dismantled, and their parts are thought to have been re-used in production of the 159 or 166 models.\n\nRecently, the chassis with serial number 010I was used in the restoration of a 125 S. It is rumored that 010I is actually s/n 01C. The story goes that 01C was re-stamped as 010I, and sold to a customer as a new car. Upon taking receipt of the car, the new owner immediately exclaimed, \"muletto!\", which means \"Test mule\" in Italian, as he could clearly see that his supposedly new car was in fact a used, well-raced car. Ferrari made a new invoice for the car, including a considerable rebate given the car's second-hand nature.\n\nStill in 166 Spyder Corsa configuration, the car was recently sold to Symbolic Motors. Close inspection of the chassis and its serial number led to the discovery of an old stamping that could possibly read 01C. It had been covered by an aluminum plate which bore the serial number 010I. Subsequently, the car was sold to its current owner, who refitted the chassis with a body similar to the factory's 125 S replica, which was built by Michelotto in 1987. The alleged 01C made its public debut at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance, and was entered as a \"Ferrari 125 S\". The car continues to be the subject of much debate among Ferrari historians and enthusiasts; recent developments indicate that the restamped serial number was in fact a correction and not an alteration.\n\nThe 125 S debuted at the Circuito di Piacenza, driven by Franco Cortese, but was unable to finish the race, despite a favorable showing against the strong Maserati 6CS 1500s.\n\nTwo weeks later, the 125 S claimed Ferrari's first victory at the Grand Prix of Rome on the Terme di Caracalla Circuit, where it was also driven by Cortese. The car had spun a bearing in practice, and was repaired in the shop of Tino Martinoli, who later came to America with the Ferrari Indy car team.\n\nThe 125 S won six of its fourteen races in 1947, though drivers Clemente Biondetti and Giuseppe Navone were unable to win the 1947 Mille Miglia in it.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1895804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1895804", "title": "The Scions of Shannara", "text": "The Scions of Shannara\n\nThe Scions of Shannara is a fantasy novel by American writer Terry Brooks. It is the first book in the \"Heritage of Shannara\" series, which takes place three hundred years after the end of the previous \"Shannara\" trilogy. The first version was published in 1990. The book follows the lives of the \"Scions of Shannara\", Par Ohmsford, Walker Boh, and Wren (Ohmsford).\n\nThe Scions of Shannara is set in a land ruled by the cruel military order called the Federation. The Elves have vanished, while the dwarves are imprisoned for having fought the Federation in the past. The Dwarves are sent to dig in mines, and will soon be extinct because of the Federation's wickedness. Magic is forbidden.\n\nPar Ohmsford and his brother Coll start the story in Varfleet, telling legends and important histories of the past about the adventures of the Ohmsfords and the druids in a tavern through the use of Par's magic, the wishsong. The wishsong is but an illusion seen when Par sings what he wants to create. However, what Par and Coll are doing is illegal under the law of the Federation because magic is supposedly the cause for various problems that are occurring in the Four Lands. On one night, Rimmer Dall, first Seeker for the Federation, bursts into the tavern, having found out about Par and Coll, and tries to arrest them. Par and Coll are rescued by a mysterious man, who claims to be a leader of the rebel group (or the Movement). The man does not give them his name, though he does hand Par a ring with a hawk insignia. He tells them that when they need help they can go to a certain forge, show the ring, and they will be led to the Movement's base. Thus, the two brothers escape and after much debate decide to travel to Leah to meet up with their friend, Morgan Leah. Upon their way, they are attacked by a frightening woods hag who is a Shadowen, a beast of legend and of great power. Yet they are saved by an old man, Cogline, who was once a Druid, and is now a messenger for the Shade of Allanon. He informs them that they must travel to the Hadeshorn in order to meet with the ancient Druid, Allanon. The fate of the Four Lands lies upon them and the other scions of Shannara: Wren in the Westland and Walker Boh who lives somewhere in the Eastland, and to whom Cogline is to deliver the message also. The Shadowen threaten to overcome all the Races.\n\nThe two brothers, and later Walker Boh and Wren, travel to the Hadeshorn through much peril. All the scions meet at the Valley of Shale and receive tasks from the shade of Allanon. Wren is charged to return the missing Elves, Walker is charged with returning Paranor and the Druids, and Par is charged with finding the lost Sword of Shannara. Both Wren and Walker see their charges as impossible (Walker even goes as far to say that he would rather lose his hand than recover lost Paranor and restore the druid order) and leave, but Par is determined to fulfill his task.\n\nPar heads to the forge, hoping that the Movement will know more of the Four Land in order to find the Sword. He comes to the city of Varfleet with his companions, Morgan Leah, Coll Ohmsford, Steff, and Teel to request for help from an outlaw ally. Upon reaching their meeting point, however, they are pursued by Federation. Hirehone, one of the outlaws, hides them in an underground basement before taking them to the Parma Key, base of the Movement. The company meets the mysterious leader who then tells them that he is Padishar Creel. He says he knows where the Sword is, leaving the Dwarves behind, Creel, Morgan, Coll, a group of outlaws, and Par set out for Tyrsis, the last known place of the Sword of Shannara. Once in Tyrsis, Creel leads them to a hiding place. Padishar Creel goes out to show Par about the truth. They meet with a girl, Damson Rhee. The three of them go for a walk and Creel explains that the Bridge of Sendric and People's Park in Tyrsis where the Sword was said to be placed many years before were destroyed. The ancient Bridge and Park were covered up in the Pit, a place guarded and unseen, and that fake ones were built in their place. They devise a plan so that Morgan, Par, Coll, Padishar, and some of the other outlaws venture into the Pit, where the Sword of Shannara was last seen.\nThen at night, the group go into out to the pit. They lower a ladder into the Pit, but unfortunately the Federation guards see them. The rebels and Par, Coll, and Morgan are captured and are told that one of the outlaws had betrayed them. Par uses the Wishsong to distract the guards so he could escape. He meets with Damson, and together they make a plan to free their companions. They do just that, and after hiding in another place, they make a plan to go into the Pit again. The second time the company, excluding Damson, makes it to the bottom of the Pit safely. There Par finds out that he can use another kind of magic that can find things that he wants, and he sees through this that the Sword is indeed there. However, they are confronted by Shadowen. Creel and Morgan make a stand in order for Par and Coll to escape. Par and Coll flee and are hidden by Damson, thinking that their friends are dead. Par insists on them to venture into the Pit a last time, and Damson knows a creature that might know another way into it. She leads them to the Mole, who agrees to help them, and escorts them through a series of tunnels and into the Pit. Damson and the Mole stay outside, while Par and Coll go in. This time Par does find the Vault, where the Sword is placed, and goes in, leaving Coll to stand guard outside (Coll wanted to). Par finds the Sword, and meets Rimmer Dall there, who shows him that he is a Shadowen and asks Par to join him. Par does not agree, and Rimmer Dall leaves, saying that once Par comes out of the Vault something precious will be lost. Par takes the Sword and runs out of the Vault to find that while he was gone Coll was possessed by Shadowen and that his brother has become one himself. Par kills him to escape and runs away from the Pit. He finds Damson and they hide in the tunnels that The Mole live in. Par, depressed and confused, becomes sick and Damson slowly but surely nurtures him back to health before vowing to get revenge for what happened to his brother.\n\nMeanwhile, Padishar and Morgan are actually not dead, and have fled from the city of Tyrsis, having survived using Morgan's magical Sword of Leah. But the Sword of Leah is broken in the act of breaking free from the Pit and Morgan turns ill because of this. The two of them run to Parma Key, and are closely pursued by an army of the Federation who want to put an end to the Movement once and for all, having found out the base of the rebels from a traitor. The companions come to Parma Key and prepare to battle away the Federation with the Movement. A long battle takes place, in which Morgan finds out who the traitor is - it being Teel the Dwarf, who is now a Shadowen, who is on her way to opening a passageway into Parma Key for the Federation to breach. Creel and Morgan fight her, and both are wounded in the act, while Steff, her lover, is killed by Teel. However, the passageway was opened, since they were too late, and so Morgan and Creel head back. The Movement then escapes using another secret tunnel and are free for the time. The battle ends thus, with the escape of the Movement.\n\nWalker Boh believes it is impossible for him to recover lost Paranor and the Druids, until Cogline brings him an old Druid History. Then Walker learns that he must first find the Black Elfstone from the Hall of Kings and with it accomplish his task. He goes to the Hall of Kings, which is an ancient place of great evil. There he goes and upon coming there goes to the location of the Black Elfstone. Using the magic he had mastered, he senses where the black elfstone is. He goes to where he feels something and there he encounters an Asphinx, a snake that turns everything it poisons to stone before becoming rock itself, instead of the black elfstone. The Asphinx bites him and Walker finds that his hand has turned to stone, effectively trapping him. Walker also knows that he is doomed because the poison of the Asphinx will spread until he has been completely turned to stone.\n\n\nDr. Michael Burry named his hedge fund company Scion Capital after the book.\n\n"}
{"id": "1895805", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1895805", "title": "Lenalidomide", "text": "Lenalidomide\n\nLenalidomide, sold under the trade name Revlimid among others, is a medication used to treat multiple myeloma (MM) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). For MM it is used after at least one other treatment and generally together with dexamethasone. It is taken by mouth.\nCommon side effects include diarrhea, itchiness, join pain, fever, headache, and trouble sleeping. Severe side effects may include low blood platelets, low white blood cells, and blood clots. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. The dose may need to be adjusted in people with kidney problems. It has a chemical structure similar to thalidomide but has a different mechanism of action. How it works is not entirely clear as of 2019.\nLenalidomide was approved for medical use in the United States in 2005. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. In the United States it costs about US$16,000 to US$21,000 per month as of 2019. In the United Kingdom this amount costs the NHS about £3,400 to 4,400.\n\nLenalidomide is used to treat multiple myeloma. It is a more potent molecular analog of thalidomide, which inhibits tumor angiogenesis, tumor-secreted cytokines, and tumor proliferation through induction of apoptosis.\n\nLenalidomide is effective at inducing a complete or \"very good partial\" response and improves progression-free survival. Adverse events more common in people receiving lenalidomide for myeloma include neutropenia, deep vein thrombosis, infections, and an increased risk of other hematological malignancies. The risk of second primary hematological malignancies does not outweigh the benefit of using lenalidomide in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. It may be more difficult to mobilize stem cells for autograft in people who have received lenalidomide.\n\nIn 2006, lenalidomide received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance for use in combination with dexamethasone in people with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. In 2017, the FDA approved lenalidomide as standalone maintenance therapy (without dexamethasone) for people with multiple myeloma following autologous stem cell transplant.\n\nIn 2009, The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence issued a final appraisal determination approving lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone as an option to treat people with multiple myeloma who have received two or more prior therapies in England and Wales.\n\nLenalidomide was approved by the FDA on 27 December 2005 for patients with low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes who have chromosome 5q deletion syndrome (5q- syndrome) with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities. It was approved on 17 June 2013 by the European Medicines Agency for use in patients with low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes who have 5q- deletion syndrome but no other cytogenetic abnormalities and are dependent on red blood cell transfusions, for whom other treatment options have been found to be insufficient or inadequate.\n\nLenalidomide is approved by FDA as a specialty drug requiring a specialty pharmacy distribution for mantle cell lymphoma in patients whose disease has relapsed or progressed after at least two prior therapies, one of which must have included bortezomib.\n\nIn addition to embryo-fetal toxicity, lenalidomide carries black box warnings for hematologic toxicity (including neutropenia and thrombocytopenia) and thromboembolism. Serious potential side effects include thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, hepatotoxicity, and bone marrow toxicity resulting in neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Myelosuppression is the major dose-limiting toxicity, which is not the case with thalidomide. \n\nLenalidomide may be associated with such adverse effects as second primary malignancy, severe cutaneous reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, tumor lysis syndrome, tumor flare reaction, hypothyroidism, and hyperthyroidism.\n\nLenalidomide is related to thalidomide, which is known to be teratogenic. Tests in monkeys suggest that lenalidomide is likewise teratogenic. It falls under pregnancy category X and cannot be prescribed for women who are pregnant or who may become pregnant during therapy. For this reason, the drug is only available in the United States through a restricted distribution system in conjunction with a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy. Females who may become pregnant must use at least two forms of reliable contraception during treatment and for at least four weeks after discontinuing treatment with lenalidomide.\n\nLenalidomide, like its parent compound thalidomide, may cause venous thromboembolism (VTE), a potentially serious complication with their use. High rates of VTE have been found in patients with multiple myeloma who received thalidomide or lenalidomide in conjunction with dexamethasone, melphalan, or doxorubicin. \n\nIn March 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) included lenalidomide on a list of twenty prescription drugs under investigation for potential safety problems. The drug was investigated for possibly increasing the risk of developing Stevens–Johnson syndrome, a life-threatening skin condition.\n\nIn 2011, the FDA initiated an ongoing review of clinical trials that found an increased risk of developing cancers such as acute myelogenous leukemia and B-cell lymphoma, though it did not advise patients to discontinue treatment with lenalidomide.\n\nLenalidomide has been used to successfully treat both inflammatory disorders and cancers in the past ten years. There are multiple mechanisms of action, and they can be simplified by organizing them as mechanisms of action \"in vitro\" and \"in vivo\". \"In vitro\", lenalidomide has three main activities: direct anti-tumor effect, inhibition of angiogenesis, and immunomodulation. \"In vivo\", lenalidomide induces tumor cell apoptosis directly and indirectly by inhibition of bone marrow stromal cell support, by anti-angiogenic and anti-osteoclastogenic effects, and by immunomodulatory activity. Lenalidomide has a broad range of activities that can be exploited to treat many hematologic and solid cancers.\n\nOn a molecular level, lenalidomide has been shown to interact with the ubiquitin E3 ligase cereblon and target this enzyme to degrade the Ikaros transcription factors IKZF1 and IKZF3. This mechanism was unexpected as it suggests that the major action of lenalidomide is to re-target the activity of an enzyme rather than block the activity of an enzyme or signaling process, and thereby represents a novel mode of drug action. A more specific implication of this mechanism is that the teratogenic and anti-neoplastic properties of lenalidomide, and perhaps other thalidomide derivatives, could be disassociated.\n\nLenalidomide was approved for medical use in the United States in 2005.\n\nLenalidomide costs $163,381 per year for the average person in the United States. Lenalidomide made almost $9.7bn for Celgene in 2018.\n\nIn 2013, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) rejected lenalidomide for \"use in the treatment of people with a specific type of the bone marrow disorder myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)\" in England and Scotland, arguing that Celgene \"did not provide enough evidence to justify the £3,780 per month (US$5746.73) price-tag of lenalidomide for use in the treatment of people with a specific type of the bone marrow disorder myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)\".\n\nLenalidomide is undergoing clinical trial as a treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma, as well as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and solid tumor cancers, such as carcinoma of the pancreas. One Phase 3 clinical trial being conducted by Celgene in elderly patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia was halted in July 2013, when a disproportionate number of cancer deaths were observed during treatment with lenalidomide versus patients treated with chlorambucil.\n"}

He served as a shepherd alongside his father in his childhood and adolescence, but desired to enter the religious life. He was refused once but later was admitted as a Franciscan lay brother and became noted for his strict austerities, as well as his love for and compassion towards the sick.\nHe was sent to counter the arguments of the Calvinists in France but was chased out and nearly killed by a mob. He was best known for his strong and deep devotion to the Eucharist.\n\nHis piety drew people from all over seeking his counsel, and at his death caused miracles that were reported at his tomb. The process for his canonization opened and in 1618 he was beatified; Pope Alexander VIII canonized him a saint on 16 October 1690.\n\nPaschal Baylón was born on 16 May 1540 at Torrehermosa, in the Kingdom of Aragon, on the feast of the Pentecost to the poor but pious peasants Martin and Elizabeth Jubera Baylón. The fact that he was born on the feast of Pentecost led to his parents naming him \"Pascual\" (Paschal). He had at least two older siblings.\n\nHe spent his childhood and adolescence as a shepherd, and as he toiled in the fields remained attentive to the sound of the church bell which rang during the Elevation during the Mass. Paschal was very honest, and once offered to reimburse the owners of crops damaged due to his animals getting loose.\n\nHe carried a book with him into the fields where he watched the sheep, and ask those that he met to teach him the letters; and so, in a short time, being still quite young, he learned to read. Paschal in his poverty joined alms with his continual prayer; and not having any other means to relieve the poor, always gave them a good part of his own dinner which was sent him into the fields. Some of his companions were much inclined to cursing, quarrelling, and fighting; but learnt to hold their tongue in his presence since they respected his pious nature and his virtue.\n\nThose to whom he first mentioned his inclination to a religious life, recommended several richly endowed monasteries, but he answered,\"I was born poor and am resolved to die in poverty and penance\".\n\nIn 1564 he joined the Reformed Franciscans as a religious brother and commenced his period of novitiate on 2 February before making his profession on 2 February 1565 in Orito at the Saint Joseph convent. He was urged to become an ordained priest but he felt that was not the path for him. But he was once denied the chance to join on the account of his age prompting him to return to his duties as a shepherd before the order had a change of heart and admitted him into their ranks.\n\nHe had never more than one habit, and that always threadbare. He walked without sandals in the snows, and in the roughest roads. He accommodated himself to all places and seasons, and was always content, cheerful, mild, affable, and full of respect for all.\nHis jobs included serving as a cook and porter as well as the gardener and the official beggar who went around asking for alms. He lived this life in contemplation and silent meditation and often did this as he worked. He was a contemplative and had frequent ecstatic visions. He would spend the night before the altar in silence during some nights to commune with God and to meditate on the faith. But he also shrugged off those notions of him gaining a reputation coming from that pious nature. His superior sent him to France in 1576 to have him defend the Real Presence against the opinions of a Calvinist preacher. But he was despised there and was almost killed after a Huguenot mob chased him out. Those chasing him hurled stones and dirt at him causing him to break his shoulder and become bruised.\n\nThe humble friar never wasted food. The end of each week saw him eat a few boiled vegetables which had been soaked in water with the terrible smelling weed known as wormwood. He often ate scraps from the kitchen. Other austerities included wearing a coat with steel spikes or a patched habit including one tunic lined with rough pig hair designed to cause discomfort. Sometimes he slept out in the cold.\n\nHe died on 17 May after being taken ill; this day is also his feast day.\n\nHis tomb in Villarreal became an immediate place of pilgrimage and there were soon miracles that were reported at his tomb. Pope Paul V beatified him on 29 October 1618 while Pope Alexander VIII canonized him later on 16 October 1690. In 1730 an indigenous Guatemalan claimed to have had a vision of a sainted Paschal appearing as a robed skeleton. This event became the basis of the heterodox tradition of San Pascualito.\n\nHe was enlisted in the church's struggle against Modernism part of which was through increasing devotion towards the Eucharist; Pope Leo XIII proclaimed the saint as the \"seraph of the Eucharist\" as well as the patron of Eucharistic congresses and affiliated associations. Art often depicts him wearing the Franciscan habit and bearing a monstrance which signifies his devotion to the Holy Eucharist. Pope John XXIII named the saint as the patron for the Segorbe diocese on 12 May 1961.\n\nDuring the Red Terror at the time of the Spanish Civil War his grave was desecrated and anticlerical leftists had his relics burned though some remained. Those that did were later transferred in the presence of King Juan Carlos I on 12 May 1992.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1895840", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1895840", "title": "Ewha Womans University", "text": "Ewha Womans University\n\nEwha Womans University () is a private women's university in Seoul founded in 1886 by Mary F. Scranton under Emperor Gojong. It is the first founded university in South Korea. It is currently the world's largest female educational institute and one of the most prestigious universities in South Korea.\n\nEwha Womans University traces its roots back to Mary F. Scranton's Ewha Haktang () mission school for girls, which opened with one student on May 31, 1886. The name Ewha, which means “Pear Blossoms”, was bestowed by the Emperor Gojong the following year. The image of the pear blossom is incorporated in the school's logo.\n\nThe school began providing college courses in 1910, and professional courses for women in 1925. The high school section, now known as Ewha Girls' High School (not to be confused with the coeducational Ewha Womans University High School, the university's demonstration school, founded in 1958), separated from the college section and is currently located in Jung-gu, Seoul. Both institutions share the same motto and the \"pear blossoms\" image in their logos.\n\nImmediately following liberation of Korea on August 15, 1945, the college received government permission to become a university. It was the first South Korean university to be officially organized.\n\nAccording to figures provided by the university in April 2018, there are 21,596 enrolled students at the university.\n\nWhile figures on the student body's gender breakdown are not available, Korea JoongAng Daily reported in 2003 there were 10 male students enrolled at the time. In 2009, Asian Correspondent reported that male students make up 30% of all foreign international students at the university.\n\nThe university collaborates with around 830 partners in 64 countries including Australian National University, Cornell University, Freie University of Berlin, Ghent University, Harvard University, Indiana University, King’s College London, Nanyang Technological University, Peking University, University of Kuala Lumpur, University of California, Irvine, University of British Columbia, University of Edinburgh, University of Hong Kong, University of South Carolina, Uppsala University, Waseda University, and a direct exchange program with Mills College in Oakland, California.\n\nThe university now explains its peculiar name by saying that while the lack of an apostrophe in \"Womans University\" is unconventional, the use of \"Woman\" rather than \"Women\" was normal in the past.\n\nIt claims the use of \"Womans\" carries special meaning in that the early founders of the college thought that every woman is to be respected; to promote this idea, they chose the word \"woman\" to avoid lumping students together under the word \"women\". The claim has not been substantiated.\n\nEwha Womans University Museum opened in April 1935. It has a wide range of artifacts, ranging from paintings, ceramics, crafts, doubles and folk items, and its main collection is the Korean National Treasure No. 107 white porcelain, iron and grape jars. The museum consists of a permanent exhibition hall, a planning exhibition hall, a donation exhibition hall and a Damin Goksik art museum.\n\n\n\n\n\nHelen Kim, the seventh principal and first Korean principal of Ewha, is considered to be pro-Japanese. She is known to have encouraged young men to enlist in the Japanese army. The statue of Helen Kim and the building named after her on campus has been criticized. Students have protested many times to take down the statue.\nWhile Ewha Womans University has been the center of women's rights movements that had positive impacts on Korean society, this feminist feature created controversies in Korea, where misogyny is deep-seated. One example of controversies was men's benefit from military service. Originally, getting extra points on employment and being paid for higher step in the salary class were available to males who had done their mandatory military service. Yet, in 1999, Ewha Womans University students and one male student, who was a disabled student at Yonsei University, protested that this was sexist and discriminatory toward disabled people. This case eventually went to court, and the court ruled that this was, indeed, sexism and discrimination toward the disabled.\n\nEwha Womans University became embroiled in the 2016 South Korean political scandal, because a former student, Chung Yoo-ra, was admitted under a special rule change by virtue of her mother's close connections to South Korean President Park Geun-hye despite not meeting requirements. Students had already been protesting against some of the university's unilateral changes to the degree system and departments before the political scandal blew up. As a result, the university's president, Choi Kyunghee, was ousted and convicted and Chung Yoo-ra's degree was rescinded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is the singer, guitarist, and primary songwriter of the Berkeley, California punk rock band The Mr. T Experience, and has remained the only consistent member of the band since its formation in 1985, performing on ten studio albums and five EPs. He has also recorded and performed as a solo artist, releasing the album \"Show Business is My Life\" in 1999 and the EP \"Eight Little Songs\" in 2003. In recent years he has pursued a writing career in young adult literature, authoring the novels \"King Dork\" (2006), \"Andromeda Klein\" (2009), and \"King Dork Approximately\" (2014).\n\nPortman attended Mills High School in Millbrae, California in the San Francisco Bay Area. He then moved to nearby Berkeley and attended the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nPortman's musical career began during his high school years in 1979, when he played in a band called the Bent Nails alongside future Mr. T Experience bass player Byron Stamatatos. The group was short-lived but released a song entitled \"No More Riots\" on the northern California punk compilation \"Not So Quiet on the Western Front\" released by \"Maximum Rocknroll\" in 1982. After high school Portman left Millbrae for UC Berkeley but kept in touch with Stamatatos. While a student there he hosted a program on campus radio station KALX which prominently featured local punk rock music, and met fellow DJ Jon Von Zelowitz. While working at the station Portman recorded a rap version of the Dr. Seuss children's poem \"Green Eggs and Ham\". He also met Alex Laipeneiks, who had been a high school friend of Portman's younger brother John Portman. In the Summer of 1985 Portman, Zelowitz, Stamatatos, and Laipeneiks formed The Mr. T Experience. It was at this time that Portman began using the stage name \"Dr. Frank,\" which he continues to use in his musical endeavors to this day.\n\nThe Mr. T Experience recorded their first album \"Everybody's Entitled to Their Own Opinion\" in July 1986. They began to build a local following through tours and airplay on college radio stations and quickly became part of the thriving late-1980s Bay Area punk rock movement centered around the 924 Gilman Street venue and the Lookout! Records label. At this time Portman briefly also played drums with the band Sweet Baby, but quickly returned to his main focus The Mr. T Experience, who released their second album \"Night Shift at the Thrill Factory\" in 1988. Included on the album was the song \"The History of the Concept of the Soul,\" which was essentially Portman's college thesis condensed into an 80-second punk song. In 1990 the band signed to Lookout! Records, a label they remain on to this day and through which Portman has also released all of his other musical output.\n\nPortman continues to be the guitarist and vocalist for The Mr. T Experience, also acting as the band's primary songwriter. Zelowitz also contributed significantly to the band's songwriting and served as a second guitarist and occasional singer until his departure from the group in 1992, after which the band essentially became Portman's project. Despite multiple lineup changes over the years, he remains the band's sole songwriter and only remaining original member. The band has released ten full-length albums, several EPs, and numerous singles over the course of their career, with nearly all material written and sung by Portman. After some solo acoustic performances he recorded a solo album entitled \"Show Business is My Life\" in 1999 and an EP, \"Eight Little Songs\", in 2003. Many of the songs from this EP were re-recorded with The Mr. T Experience for the 2004 album \"Yesterday Rules\", their most recent and stylistically diverse release. Portman continues to perform occasionally as a solo artist. He also occasionally plays in The Bomb Bassets with his longtime friend Dallas Denery.\n\nPortman's musical style is generally characterized as pop punk, heavily influenced by the Ramones and other melodic rock groups. This is the style most generally associated with The Mr. T Experience. His compositions cover a variety of topics but are concerned primarily with personal relationships; he is known to introduce much of his material with the throwaway line \"This is a song about a girl.\" Over the years his other musical tastes and interests have pushed the band to explore many styles, branching out from the Bay Area pop punk sound which he helped define. This change is evidenced on a number of solo acoustic songs interspersed between the pop punk standards on most of the band's late-1990s albums. Portman's solo recordings have further explored these other styles and influences, including country, bossa nova, Rock & Roll, and 1960s beat music.\n\nIn recent years Portman has published a blog entitled \"Dr. Frank's What's-It.\" His young adult novel \"King Dork\" was published in April 2006. The film rights to the book were optioned by Gary Sanchez Productions that November. In May 2009 Portman reported that a new deal had been reached with Sony Pictures and that a director had been attached to the film. The Internet Movie Database lists the film as \"in development\".\n\nPortman's second novel, \"Andromeda Klein\", was published on August 25, 2009. A \"King Dork\" sequel entitled \"King Dork Approximately\" was published in 2014.\n\n\n\"Albums and EPs listed only, for a complete listing of releases see The Mr. T Experience.\"\n\n\n\n\nPortman appeared on Ken Reid's \"TV Guidance Counselor\" podcast on February 9, 2017 in an episode recorded live at SF Sketchfest.\n\n"}

These were the first elections to be held after the expiration of a full 4-year term of the previous Chamber of Representatives.\n\nThe ruling Croatian Democratic Union entered the elections weakened by the Zagreb Crisis, street protests and the series of corruption scandals that came to light in the previous parliamentary term. However, the most important factor was the deteriorating health of the party leader and Croatian president Franjo Tuđman, which sparked a succession struggle between various factions within the party.\n\nOn the other side, two major Croatian opposition parties - the Social Democratic Party of Croatia and Croatian Social Liberal Party - had their coalition formally agreed in 1998 and spent more than a year preparing for the elections. At first, they were to run together with the Croatian Peasant Party, Croatian People's Party, Istrian Democratic Assembly and Liberal Party, but as Tuđman's condition worsened leaders of the SDP and HSLS concluded that they could win elections even without those four other parties which later formed a separate bloc.\n\nLike before all previous elections since the breakup of Yugoslavia, the electoral laws were altered in an attempt to improve the chances for the ruling party; this included a new voting system and redistricting. The First Past the Post constituencies introduced in the previous election were completely abandoned and Proportional Representation was implemented (with the exception of single representative ethnic minority seats). Croatia was divided into ten electoral districts, all drawn in order to maximise the support for HDZ. Each district had to elect 14 members, with candidates' lists having to win more than 5% of the votes in order to be represented in the Sabor.\n\nDue to Tuđman's illness and death, the actual date of elections had been repeatedly postponed for constitutional reasons. There were speculations about elections being held during the Christmas holidays in order to have as many Croatian expatriates (traditional HDZ supporters) in the country, but the date of 3 January was chosen as the most suitable. As the day of the elections approached, its outcome became more certain. The campaign was brief and relatively uneventful with the HDZ being visibly weakened and demoralised by the death of its long-term leader. On the actual day of elections the turnout - the biggest since 1990 - indicated the Croatian people's desire to have their government changed.\n\nRačan was appointed Prime Minister on 27 January 2000, by a decree of the Acting President of Croatia and Speaker of the outgoing assembly of Parliament, Vlatko Pavletić, and this decision was later confirmed by a parliamentary vote on 2 February 2000 in which 122 of 151 MPs voted in favor and 1 against the cabinet, while 1 MP abstained. Račan led a coalition of SDP and HSLS, which together with a bloc of four other parties held two-thirds majority in Parliament, allowing them to amend the Constitution and transform Croatia from a semi-presidential system into an incomplete parliamentary system in November 2000 and abolish the upper chamber of Parliament, the Chamber of Counties, in March 2001. The constitutional changes of 2000 greatly limited the power of the president, but retained the direct election of that office.\n\n \"'Summary of the 3 January 2000 Croatian Parliament \"(Hrvatski Sabor)\" election results\n!colspan=2 style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\" align=left|Parties and coalitions\n!style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\" align=right|Votes\n!style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\" align=right|%\n!style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\" align=right|Seats\n!style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\" align=right|%\n!style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\" align=right|Seat trend\n!style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\" align=right|Seat change (%)\n\nNational minorities elected 5 representatives through a separate election system: Milan Đukić (47,7% of votes) for the Serb national minority, Tibor Santo (42,8%) for the Hungarian minority, Furio Radin (78,9%) for the Italian minority, Zdenka Čuhnil (40,6%) for the Czech and Slovak minorities and Borislav Graljuk (34,1%) for the Austrian, German, Jewish, Rusyn and Ukrainian minorities.\n"}
{"id": "1895862", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1895862", "title": "François Gautier", "text": "François Gautier\n\nFrançois Gautier (born 1950) is a journalist based in India who served as the \"South Asian\" correspondent for multiple reputed French-language dailies. He makes allegations of a 'Hindu Holocaust' in medieval times and advocates Indigenous Aryan theories. \n\nHe is also the founder of a private museum which seeks to portray Indian history in a nationalist manner. Gautier has written books on the history and indology; he has established NGO namely \"Foundation for Advancement of Cultural Ties\".\n\nFrancois Gautier was born in 1950 in Paris and received an upper-class Catholic education, which he did not like. He was subsequently sent to reputed boarding schools across Europe, from where he was expelled several times. He attended the IDRAC business school in Paris before dropping out to work in a small newspaper.\n\nGautier came to India at the age of 19 in 1969, as part of a trans-world journey, along with the first wave of Auroville-migrants. He was accompanied by the son of Charles François Marie Baron, Pondicherry's last French governor. Deeply impressed with Sri Aurobindo's writings, he chose to reside over Sri Aurobindo Ashram where his encounters with Mirra Alfassa influenced him to further prolong his stay. Gautier went on to stay over there for about seven years.\n\nFrançois Gautier is married to Namrita Bindra Gautier, whose mother was a Hindu and father a Sikh. Gautier primarily resides in Auroville in India, and visits his family in France annually.\n\nAfter arriving in India, Gautier stopped writing for many years and focused on other activities. In 1982, he found an article in a French newspaper, that supposedly contained clichés about the Indian socio-polity. He wrote a letter to the editor suggesting corrections, wherein he was offered to write an article. He wrote several more articles for the newspaper and went on to work as a writer and photographer for other publications.\n\nHe served as the South-Asia correspondent of \"Journal de Geneve\", a Geneva-based newspaper before switching to the same post at \"Le Figaro\" in 1993. He stayed over there for about 8 years before shifting to Ouest-France and then, La Chaîne Info.\n\nGautier used to write a regular column for \"Rediff.com\". Gautier has also written columns for \"The New Indian Express\", \"DNA India\", \"Outlook India\", and others. He is also the editor of \"La Revue de l'Inde\".\n\nGautier became interested in Indology when he began to travel outside Auroville. Sita Ram Goel contacted Gautier after reading some of his articles in a magazine called \"Blitz and\" asked for permission to reprint the articles in his book. Gautier instead wrote the book \"The Wonder That Is India\". Later, the website \"Hinduism Today\" republished it online. Following this, Gautier wrote several other books. Gautier has worked on a book about the martial art Kalaripayattu of South India with photographer Raghu Rai.\n\nIn 2010, an anonymously authored novel titled \"Hindutva, Sex and Adventure\" was published that featured a foreign radio journalist who came to India and became a Hindutva supporter—it was considered to be a satire of BBC reporter Mark Tully. It was speculated that Gautier may have been the author, but he denied the allegation.\n\nGautier has established the \"Foundation for Advancement of Cultural Ties (FACT)\", a NGO dedicated to portraying Indian history in a correct manner. It has organised multiple painting exhibitions across the country to depict and highlight how a range of events from the insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir to the cruelties of Mughal emperors has affected the life of Hindus.He eventually planned to establish a museum similar to those for the Jew cause. Gautier also planned to tour the world with his museums and aware the foreign community about the systemic extermination of Hindus. The exhibitions have received mixed response and the underlying motives have been questioned.\n\nIn 2012, the Shivaji Maharaj Museum of Indian History was established by FACT. In 2013, during the visit of the 14th Dalai Lama, Gautier and his wife, organised an exhibition on the origin of Buddhism in India and its spread to Tibet with the help of materials from the Tibet Museum of Dharamsala, to educate the local people about Tibetan culture.\n\nGautier contends that India, through the exercise and spread of Sanatan dharma shall strive to be a global superpower \"but\" prior to that shall decentralize the economy and Indianize its social, political and educational systems, even at the cost of democratic principles and the constitution. In abidance with a Hinducentric scholarship, he has criticized the narrative of Indian historiography to be leftist, which have apparently glorified foreign invaders at the cost of the Hindu empires, and thus urges for a complete revisionism. \n\nA front-line Hindutva activist, Gautier also deems Hinduism to be under threat from Islam, Christian missionaries, Marxism and westernisation, HE (thus) calls for \"use-of-force\" by the oppressed Hindus and opines of the Buddhist-Jain philosophies of \"Ahimsa\" to have actually enabled exploitation of India by foreign invaders. One of his most prominent views is about the existence of a Hindu Holocaust, perpetrated by Islamic invaders which (supposedly) exceeded the extents of the Jew Holocaust and all other genocides. Gautier has also rejected the western-oriental scholarship of Max Müller, Arthur Llewellyn Basham as ill-portrayals of the history of the nation which birthed the theory of Hindu imperialism. \n\nGautier accepts the Indigenous Aryan hypothesis in favor of the Indo-Aryan migration theory and supports the idea of Jesus Christ having come to India, to be inspired by Hindu and Buddhist esoterism. He also considers Koenraad Elst as one of the most knowledgeable scholars on India and regretted of his' being unable to publish except from Hindu-oriented publishing houses. A staunch opponent of Nehruvian ideologies, he has critiqued Gandhi's policy towards Muslim separatists during the partition of India as Muslim-appeasement. Gautier have also attacked the existence and manifestation of caste privilege in the Indian society and derivatives thereof, instead arguing for a hypothesis wherein the socially and economically privileged and dis-privileged populaces are in a constant flux and which primarily manifests in reverse discrimination in the long run.  \n\nHe has criticized the United Progressive Alliance government (2009-2014) and claimed that terrorism continued unabated whilst Muslim mullahs were allowed to preach freely and Hindu gurus were being targeted by the media and police. He has earlier criticized the usage of the term \"Godman\" by Indian media to describe self-proclaimed Hindu gurus proposing that Indian journalists often were not proud of their culture and had called for imparting a more fairer treatment.\n\nManisha Basu, writing in \"The Rhetoric of Hindu India\", deems him to be part of a \"suave\" derivative of Hindutva and notes of his consistent attacks upon left-liberal commentators -- people who have supposedly leveraged their social privilege to dominate the socio-political consciousness of the \"Anglophone national bourgeoisie\" for long enough -- in the process of becoming one of the few self-appointed interpreters of the Indian Right. Malini Parthasarathy too notes him to be a prominent voice of Hindutva, others have noted him as an ideologue as well. Basu remarks of his attacks against the constructs of Brahmanic privilege (and other intersectionalities) along with the radical perspectivising of \"proper\" historiography to be mere statistical extensions of first-hand-experiences have a high degree of similarity to Jay Dubashi's writings and his broader views about the journalistic model of history. Scholars have rejected his theories of a Hindu-Holocaust and have deemed him to be Islamophobic. \n\nHe was subject to severe criticism after having objected to the proposed induction of Aamir Khan, a Muslim Bollywood actor over a planned dramatization of Mahabharata, a Hindu epic. He had earlier asked for the boycott of PK, a Bollywood film starring the same actor, due to its depiction of a Hindu-Muslim love affair and accused Ashoka University of teaching an anti-Hindu anti-Brahmin book.\n\nIn 2017, Gautier claimed over a blog at The Times of India to have come across a hitherto-hidden manuscript of Nostradamus in a trunk, that (successfully) prophesied the statesmanship of Narendra Modi. The claims were reported across multiple news-outlets. Earlier he had asserted of Nostradamus to have established the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, an Indian Hindu nationalist organisation. Other claims included that Nostradamus had successfully prophesied the chances of a possible nuclear war between India and Pakistan, the construction of Ram Mandir and the Hindu domination of world affairs after 2014. He later said in an interview that this had been a \"spoof\", but it was taken in earnest by some commentators who accused him of having tampered with the original passages for fulfilling his political agenda. At one case, he used the same passage over his blogs across the course of a few years but changed the name of the subjects to keep up with the political currents. Gautier has been documented to have propagated fake news over other occasions.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1895863", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1895863", "title": "Arthur Vierendeel", "text": "Arthur Vierendeel\n\nArthur Vierendeel (10 April 1852 – 8 November 1940) was a civil engineer born in Leuven, Belgium. He had a career as a university professor, and civil engineer. The structure known as the Vierendeel truss is named after him.\n\nHe obtained an MSc in construction and mining engineering in 1874 at the \"Université catholique de Louvain\", after which he worked as an engineer for the company \"Nicaise et Delcuve\" in La Louvière, Belgium. In 1885 he became Director for the Ministry of Public Works in West Flanders, and four years afterward also achieved the post of Professor of Construction, Material Strength, and Structural Engineering at the \"Université catholique de Louvain\".\n\nThe idea of a bridge without trusses came to him in 1895; the design later became known as a Vierendeel bridge. For the 1897 World Fair at Brussels he built a 31.5m span bridge at his own expense and loaded to show the correlation between measurement and his numerical analysis.\n\nHis work, \"Cours de stabilité des constructions\" (1889) was an important reference during more than half a century. His first bridge was built in Avelgem in 1902, crossing the Scheldt river. The construction of this bridge became famous through the Stijn Streuvels book \"De Teloorgang van de Waterhoek\".\n\nHe retired as director of public works in West Flanders in 1927, and as Professor at Leuven Catholic University in 1936. He died in 1940.\n\nThe Vierendeel truss was used in Belgium, particularly on the Belgian railways. Discussions in the journal \"Der Eisenbau\" concerning the pros and cons of the Vierendeel truss led to the development of deformational modelling of structures - necessary for mathematical analysis of Vierendeel trusses.\n\nHe emphasised an importance of aesthetics over pure engineering:\n\nAs of 2011 the 'castellated beam' and 'cellular beam' are in common use in construction for roof and floor support - both are open web structures without diagonal trusses; vierendeel truss type analysis is used to understand and predict failure modes, which include vierendeel truss type failures.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1895867", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1895867", "title": "The Rock 'n' Roll Express", "text": "The Rock 'n' Roll Express\n\nThe Rock 'n' Roll Express is a professional wrestling tag team consisting of professional wrestlers Robert Gibson and Ricky Morton. The duo began teaming together in Memphis in the early 1980s, followed by Universal Wrestling Federation (known as Mid-South wrestling at the time), followed by a stint with Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP). They held the NWA World Tag Team Championship nine times, with the first four times in JCP. They also feuded with the Four Horsemen. In the late 1980s, they were contenders for the American Wrestling Association's AWA World Tag Team Championship. By 1991, the team was losing momentum, and Morton turned heel on his partner to join The York Foundation in World Championship Wrestling (WCW). In 1992, the team reformed in Smoky Mountain Wrestling, where they held the SMW Tag Team Championship ten times. The duo also worked in the World Wrestling Federation. On March 31, 2017, the duo was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by Jim Cornette.\n\nThe Rock 'n' Roll Express was formed with Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson in 1983 in Memphis by head booker Jerry Lawler. They were originally paired together as an alternative to the popular team of The Fabulous Ones (Steve Keirn and Stan Lane) when they could not wrestle in certain towns. The gimmick of The Rock 'n' Roll Express was a couple of high flying wrestlers who loved glam metal music, as it was a popular genre of music at the time. In 1983 and 1984, the team participated in a series of matches against The Galaxians, the Bruise Brothers (Porkchop Cash and Troy Graham), and the team of Lanny Poffo and Randy Savage.\n\nThey soon made their way to Mid-South Wrestling where they started a feud with the Midnight Express (Bobby Eaton, Dennis Condrey, and manager Jim Cornette). The feud began when Cornette threw a celebration for the Midnight Express after they won the Mid-South Tag Team Championship. During the celebration, The Rock 'n' Roll Express shoved Cornette's face into the celebratory cake. The rivalry between the two teams carried on into the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA).\n\nThe Rock N' Roll Express went to the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA)'s Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) in 1985 and won four NWA World Tag Team Championships over the next couple of years. On July 9, 1985, the team debuted in JCP against the team of Ivan Koloff and Krusher Khrushchev, whom they defeated to begin their first reign as champions. The reign lasted until October 13 of that same year. At Starrcade in 1985, they recaptured the title, only to lose them on a prime time WTBS special to the Midnight Express, \"Superstars on the Superstation\", on February 7, 1986. This title change is significant because televised matches between major contenders were rarely shown in those days. They won the title back in Philadelphia on August 16, 1986, and held them until a Saturday night prime time match on WTBS' \"World Championship Wrestling\" against Rick Rude and the Raging Bull Manny Fernandez. The Rock 'n' Roll Express won the belts back when Rude, still a champion, simply left the NWA to go work for Vince McMahon in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). Needing to save face, promoter Jim Crockett had Ivan Koloff substitute for an 'injured' Rude, and the Express won the belts for what proved to be the final time.\n\nDuring their time in JCP, the Rock 'n' Roll Express achieved enormous popularity. At times the company would run two shows in one night, with the Rock N Roll often headlining the \"B\" team cards they would usually outdraw the concurrent \"A\" team shows with bigger named talent. On one occasion this led them to a jealous reprimand from booker Dusty Rhodes after they sold out Charlotte, while the A team card with Rhodes did less than half the gate in Baltimore. Morton and Gibson were so popular during this time period that they were actually asked to leave Carowinds Amusement Park because they were creating a mob and it was shutting down the park. It was a common occurrence for the fans to swarm them as they did their ring entrance which drew a huge crowd reaction when their music (ELO's Rock N' Roll Is King and later Ricky Morton's Boogie Woogie Dance Hall) began. Fans would also hang out at their houses, and at the height of their popularity the Charlotte police would station an officer at their homes to keep the fans away. Robert Gibson says that they went nine months without a day off during this period and when they requested time off, Jim Crockett told them that it would cost them too much money in lost ticket sales. They eventually would fake injuries to get days off.\n\nIn November 1986 at Starrcade, The Rock 'n' Roll Express defeated Ole Anderson and Arn Anderson in a Steel Cage match to retain the NWA World Tag Team Championship. After a series of matches running from late August through early October, they lost their title for a fourth and final time (They would win four more in later years, but only the first four were also recognized by World Championship Wrestling later) in the fall of 1987 to Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard thanks to a pre-match attack by their longtime rivals The Midnight Express. Morton suffered an injured arm in the attack which led to Gibson beginning the match alone. Eventually Morton would join the match in a sling, but the match ended when Gibson told the referee to stop the match due to Morton's injury. They feuded heavily with The Four Horsemen members Ric Flair, Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard, who constantly mocked them and attacked them outside of the ring.\n\nDuring late 1987 the Rock 'n' Roll Express feud with the Midnight Express heated up again which led to an historic scaffold match on November 26, 1987 at Starrcade 87 in Chicago. Morton and Gibson defeated Bobby Eaton and Stan Lane eight minutes into the match. As 1988 began they entered into a brief feud with the Sheepherders. On January 23, 1988 in Cincinnati, Ivan Koloff & the Warlord defeated The Rock 'n' Roll Express in twelve seconds, with Morton and Gibson leaving the company after the match. After a several month absence Ricky and Robert did an interview with Bob Caudle at Clash of the Champions II where they discussed returning to the NWA. On June 26 at the start of The Great American Bash Tour, Ricky and Robert defeated the Sheepherders in their return match. Rock 'n' Roll Express won several more matches with the Sheepherders as well as a few others until a pay dispute led to Robert Gibson departing JCP again in late July. Ricky Morton stayed on and wrestled singles matches, as well as tag team and six man matches with a variety of partners such as Nikita Koloff, Brad Armstrong, and Steve Williams. Morton had his last match on September 23, 1988 before leaving JCP again.\n\nIn 1988, The Rock 'n' Roll Express went to Memphis and AWA. They had a brief feud with The Midnight Rockers in the Continental Wrestling Association (CWA), over the AWA World Tag Team Championship. Their first match on February 15, 1988, ended in controversy, causing the AWA World Tag Team title to be held up. A week later, on February 22, a rematch for the held-up titles was held and The Midnight Rockers won them back. In all, the Rock N Roll Express spent April to May, and October to December 1988 in the AWA having short runs with Verne Gagne. Robert Gibson stated that they went to AWA out of respect to Wahoo McDaniel who was wrestling there at the time. On February 2, 1988 in Kansas City they had a match with The British Bulldogs, and they also did a brief tour in Japan during 1988.\n\nOn January 3, 1990 Morton and Gibson made their return to the NWA. During the early part of the return they had TV matches with the Midnight Express, the Horsemen, and The Fabulous Freebirds. On July 7, 1990, they challenged Doom for the NWA World Tag Team Championship at The Great American Bash in the semi-main event, but lost. On September 22, 1990 in a match against Doom in Jacksonville Florida, Robert Gibson suffered a torn ACL when Ron Simmons came off the top rope on his extended knee while Butch Reed was holding it. Morton would state years later on a podcast with Ric Flair that the injury actually occurred the day before the match when Robert's wife hit him with a car. Ricky says that he told Robert to just get to the ring and go down right after the start of the match so that he could be paid while injured. Gibson was forced to miss a considerable amount of time throughout the rest of 1990 and the first half of 1991 while recovering from surgery which was performed by Dr. James Andrews. On June 12, 1991 at \"Clash of the Champions XV\" in Knoxville Tennessee, Morton turned on a returning Gibson to join the York Foundation which led to a match between Morton and Gibson at The Great American Bash on July 14, 1991. Richard Morton (w/ Alexandra York) pinned Robert Gibson at 17:23 after Morton came off the top and hit Gibson in the back with the computer as York distracted referee Bill Alfonso on the apron. The former partners had more matches over the next several weeks, mostly won by Morton. Morton and Gibson continued their singles careers until Robert was released by WCW in the early fall. Morton stayed on in WCW as a heel until the summer of 1992.\n\nIn late July 1992, Ricky Morton briefly feuded with Eddie Gilbert in the United States Wrestling Association (USWA), and before his brief USWA run ended, Gibson joined him for a few tag team matches. They reunited on August 8, 1992 in Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW) and feuded with The Heavenly Bodies, winning the tag team title ten times. The feud with the Heavenly Bodies, which had been ongoing for approximately a year, included a barbed wire cage match and a Texas death match. The rivalry carried over to both World Championship Wrestling and the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1993, splitting pay per view matches for the two promotions. The Rock 'n' Roll Express defeated the Heavenly Bodies (Stan Lane and Dr. Tom Prichard) at WCW's SuperBrawl III event and the Bodies (this time Prichard and Jimmy Del Ray) defeating the Express for the SMW Tag Team Championship at the Survivor Series. Defending the SMW tag title at the event was part of an agreement between the WWF's Vince McMahon and SMW's Jim Cornette.\n\nBack in SMW in May 1994, The Rock 'n' Roll Express lost their title to the team of Chris Candido and Brian Lee, who were managed by Tammy Fytch. The duo, however, won the title back in August. After that feud ended, they feuded with The Gangstas over the titles. During that feud, they had Jim Cornette as their manager. Soon after the Gangstas feuded, Cornette betrayed Morton and Gibson, as they feuded with The Dynamic Duo, whom they lost the titles to in April 1995.\n\nIn April 1995, they defeated Dick Murdoch and Randy Rhodes to win the vacant NWA World Tag Team Championship. In June 1995, they were stripped of the titles, as their USWA match with PG-13 ended in controversy. A week later, they defeated PG-13 to win back the NWA World Tag Team titles and win the USWA World Tag Team Championship, making them double champions, but it didn't last, as they lost the USWA titles back to PG-13 a week later. In July 1995, they scheduled to feud with The Thugs over the SMW Tag Team Championship, and set to turn heel, but in August 1995, Morton was suspended after an altercation between his girlfriend Andrea Callaway and Tracy Smothers' girlfriend Angela Lambert, leaving Gibson on his own. As a result of Morton's suspension, they vacated the NWA World Tag Team titles. When Morton returned to SMW, Gibson had turned heel and joined Jim Cornette's Militia, but the proposed feud between the two didn't materialize as the promotion folded shortly after his return.\n\nAfter SMW's closure, they reunited in the USWA and resumed their feud with PG-13.\n\nOn June 3, 1996, Morton and Gibson made their return to World Championship Wrestling on Monday Nitro, facing and losing to Ric Flair and Arn Anderson, and preliminarily reigniting an old WCW rivalry. They made their second appearance on Monday Nitro, August 5, 1996, losing to WCW World Tag-Team Champions Harlem Heat. Their third appearance came three weeks later, where they faced Ric Flair and Arn Anderson again on Nitro in Lakeland, FL. They lost to Flair and Anderson, but three days later in Orlando, FL at a WCW Worldwide taping, the Rock 'n' Roll Express gained their first victory in their comeback, defeating High Voltage. Their next appearance came on WCW Saturday Night on September 30, where they fell to The Faces of Fear (Meng and The Barbarian). Morton and Gibson appeared sparingly going forward on Saturday Night and \"WCW Pro\". They left in 1997 to participate in independent federations.\n\nA year later, they were in the WWE for a brief stint as part of the NWA angle (managed by former rival James E. Cornette). Their first appearance came on Monday Night RAW when they faced Skull and 8-Ball on January 12, 1998 in State College, PA and lost via disqualification. During their time in the company, they appeared at WrestleMania XIV in March 1998 in a tag team battle royal, which was won by the Legion of Doom 2000. They also had feuds with L.O.D. 2000 and The New Midnight Express having an NWA Tag Team Title match at the WWF Pay Per View Unforgiven against the New Midnight Express.\n\nIn early 2003, Morton and Gibson appeared in TNA as part of Vince Russo's Sports Entertainment Xtreme (SEX) faction. The duo feuded with America's Most Wanted, Chris Harris and James Storm. In late 2003 and early 2004, they worked for the All World Wrestling League, owned by Eddie and Thomas Farhat, the sons of the \"Original Sheik\" Ed Farhat. The duo returned to TNA for the special Total Nonstop Deletion, participating in the Tag Team Apocalypto open invitational for The Broken Hardys' TNA World Tag Team Championship.\n\nStarting in 2005, they would team up again, often wrestling against the Midnight Express in the Mid-Atlantic area. On June 7, 2008, they defeated The Midnight Express (Dennis Condrey and Bobby Eaton) at the NWA 60th Anniversary Show in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nThe Rock 'n' Roll Express have joined up with Booker T's Pro Wrestling Alliance in Houston, TX and have become the PWA Tag Team Champions.\n\nOver the years, when Morton and Gibson were not teaming with each other, they each had different tag team partners, calling themselves \"The New Rock 'n' Roll Express.\" Ricky Morton teamed with Ricky Fuji while in Japan for FMW, and with Brad Armstrong, Kid Kash, or his cousin Todd in the independent circuit in the U.S., while Robert Gibson teamed with Marty Jannetty in IWA Japan as \"The Rock 'n' Rockers,\" which played off both the Rock 'n' Roll Express and Jannetty's famous tag team with Shawn Michaels, The Rockers.\n\nBrawl in the Fall and The Pastor of Pain\n\nOn November 1, 2014, The Rock n Roll express were contracted for a match at \"The Brawl in the Fall\" at a church in rural North Carolina. Approximately 30 minutes before match time, Gibson approached the promoter (George South) to ask for $500 above the previously agreed compensation. South refused, sending Gibson into a fit of rage. Gibson then kicked a toilet in the church restroom, breaking the seat, and departed the venue. The Student Pastor at the church joined Morton's corner under the ring name \"The Pastor of Pain\"(PoP). This version of The New Rock n Roll express was victorious over \"The Dawsons\" with a roll up by Morton for the pinfall. The Dawsons immediately attacked Morton from behind. When The Pastor of Pain came to the aid of Morton, The Dawsons attempted a clothesline, but PoP ducked under and delivered a devastating double clothesline of his own.\n\nOn February 6, 2017, the WWE announced it would be honoring the Rock 'n' Roll Express by inducting the team into the WWE Hall of Fame at the 2017 WWE Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony on March 31, 2017. On March 20, WWE officially announced that the team will be inducted by Jim Cornette. They recently captured the Viral Pro Wrestling Tag Team Championships at VPW's Holiday Havoc on December 9, 2017. They will be DLC for WWE 2K18.\n\nOn April 5, 2019, the NWA announced that the Rock 'n' Roll Express would compete in the Crockett Cup (2019) on April 27, 2019 in Concord, North Carolina. They were defeated by The Briscoe Brothers (Jay Briscoe and Mark Briscoe) in the first round. On October 1, 2019, during the second day of NWA Power television tapings, The Rock 'n' Roll Express defeated The Wildcards (Thomas Latimer & Royce Isaacs) to win the NWA World Tag Team Championship for the fifth time.\n\nOn September 28, 2019, the Rock 'n' Roll Express made their New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) debut at Fighting Spirit Unleashed (2019) in New York City, New York. They teamed with Hiroshi Tanahashi and defeated \"Los Ingobernables de Japon\" (Bushi, Shingo Takagi, and Tetsuya Naito), it was also referee Tiger Hattori's final match in the United States. On September 29, at Fighting Spirit Unleashed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, they teamed with Tanahashi and Chaos (Hirooki Goto, Tomohiro Ishii, and Yoshi-Hashi) in a twelve-man tag team elimination match versus Bullet Club (Jay White, Kenta, Tama Tonga, Tanga Loa, Chase Owens, and Gedo).\n\nThe Rock 'n' Roll Express made their All Elite Wrestling (AEW) appearance on the October 30, 2019 episode of \"\" to crown the inaugural AEW World Tag Team Champions, but were ambushed by Proud n Powerful (Santana and Ortiz). At AEW Full Gear, the two participated in the aftermath of the opening tag team match between The Young Bucks and Proud n Powerful, where Morton executed a Canadian Destroyer on Santana followed up by a suicide dive onto Sammy Guevara and Ortiz.\n\n\n"}

Examples of this type include Britannia, Germania, Hibernia, Helvetia and Polonia. Examples of personifications of the Goddess of Liberty include Marianne, the Statue of Liberty (\"Liberty Enlightening the World\"), and many examples of United States coinage. Another ancient model was Roma, a female deity who personified the city of Rome and more broadly, the Roman state, and who was revived in the 20th Century as the personification of Mussolini's \"New Roman Empire\".

In this verse they tell him by quoting from the Book of Micah.\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 2:6\n\nThis verse is taken from . Unlike the previous time Matthew quoted the Old Testament in the wording does not seem to be taken from the Septuagint, rather it seems to be an original translation from the Hebrew. Matthew's version differs substantially from both the Septuagint and Masoretic.\n\nMatthew's translation has several important differences from that found in the Septuagint. The King James Version of Micah 5:2, based on the Septuagint, reads:\n\nEphratah was a town near the Bethlehem in Judea. Some disambiguation is needed as there was at least one other town named Bethlehem at the time. Both referencing a larger neighbour and the province were accepted methods of disambiguation at the time, but the question is why Matthew changes the form. Two other references to Bethlehem being in Judea in and show that Matthew felt that showing Jesus was born in Judea was important. In this verse he does not use the same spelling he did previously, thus also linking to the Old Testament figure Judah.\n\nThe second line is almost reversed in meaning by the author of Matthew. The original states that Bethlehem was a town of little importance that great thing would happen in. Matthew states that it is not a town of little because great things would happen there.\n\nBrown also reports that Matthew replaces the word \"ruler\" in the original, perhaps to emphasize that despite what most Jews were predicting the messiah would not be a political figure, only a spiritual one.\n\nThe portion of Micah where this quote is found is clearly discussing the messiah and states that like King David the messiah's origin would be in Bethlehem. At the time it was not widely accepted that the messiah would necessarily be born in Bethlehem, just that his ancestors would have been. It was thus not considered essential for a messiah to be someone born in that town, but it was considered a reasonable locale for a messiah to originate. Far more reasonable than the peripheral and little known town of Nazareth in Galilee where Jesus grew up.\n"}

(song)\n\n\"Hello, Dolly!\" is the title song of the popular 1964 musical of the same name. Louis Armstrong's version was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2001.\nThe music and lyrics were written by Jerry Herman, who also wrote the scores for many other popular musicals including \"Mame\" and \"La Cage aux Folles\".\n\n\"Hello, Dolly!\" was first sung by Carol Channing, who starred as Dolly Gallagher Levi in the original 1964 Broadway cast. In December 1963, at the behest of his manager, Louis Armstrong made a demonstration recording of \"Hello, Dolly!\" for the song's publisher to use to promote the show. \"Hello, Dolly!\" opened on January 16, 1964 at the St. James Theatre in New York City, and it quickly became a major success.\n\nThe same month, Kapp Records released Armstrong's publishing demo as a commercial single. His version reached number one on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100, ending the Beatles' streak of three number-one hits in a row over 14 consecutive weeks (in addition to holding the second and third chart positions) and becoming the most successful single of Armstrong's career, followed by a gold-selling album of the same name. The song also spent nine weeks atop the adult contemporary chart shortly after the opening of the musical. The song also made Armstrong the oldest artist ever to reach #1 on the Hot 100 since its introduction in 1958. \"Billboard\" ranked the record as the No. 3 song of 1964, behind the Beatles' \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" and \"She Loves You.\" In 1965, Armstrong performed the song on a German variety show with musician and bandleader Max Greger.\n\n\"Hello, Dolly!\" won the Grammy Award for Song of the Year in 1965, and Armstrong received a Grammy for Best Vocal Performance, Male. Louis Armstrong also performed the song (together with Barbra Streisand) in the popular 1969 film \"Hello, Dolly!\".\n\n\"Hello, Dolly!\" is a pop standard, and has been covered by many artists, including:\nFrank Sinatra's rendition of the song, recorded with the Count Basie Orchestra, features new lyrics, improvised by Sinatra, which pay tribute to Louis Armstrong.\n\nLyndon B. Johnson used the tune, rechristened \"Hello, Lyndon!\", as a campaign song for his run in the 1964 U.S. presidential election. This version of the song was performed by Carol Channing at that year's Democratic National Convention, and a recording was made by Ed Ames for distribution at the convention.\n\nIn 1984, Carol Channing had appeared on \"Sesame Street\" and sang a parody of the song called \"Hello, Sammy!\", a love song being sung by Carol to a character known as Sammy the Snake (as voiced by Jim Henson). Carol, in this parody segment, serenades Sammy telling him just how much she loves and adores him while Sammy coils himself around Carol's arms. They are soon joined by 4 giant swaying letter S's wearing top hats. Carol ends the song by telling Sammy just how much she'd miss him and the way he hisses if they ever parted. Carol's song includes lyrics such as: \"So..turn on your charm, Sammy/Coil yourself around my arm, Sammy/Sammy the Snake, I'll stake a claim on you\".\n\nAs successful as the stage show and title song itself turned out to be, however, the tune \"Hello, Dolly!\" became caught up in a lawsuit which could have endangered timely plans for bringing the musical to the silver screen. Mack David (1912–1993), an Academy Award-nominated composer also known for his compositions for television, sued for infringement of copyright, because the first four bars of Herman's show number, \"Hello, Dolly!\", were the same as those in the refrain of David's song \"Sunflower\" from 1948. As he recounts in his memoirs, Herman had never heard \"Sunflower\" before the lawsuit, and wanted a chance to defend himself in court, but, for the sake of those involved in the show and the potential film, he reluctantly agreed to pay a settlement before the case would have gone to trial.\n\n"}

The NHL dropped the Hamilton, Ontario team and added two new teams in the United States (US), the New York Americans and the Pittsburgh Pirates to bring the total number of teams to seven. The Ottawa Senators were the regular-season champion, but lost in the NHL playoff final to the Montreal Maroons. The Maroons then defeated the defending Stanley Cup champion Victoria Cougars of the newly renamed Western Hockey League three games to one in a best-of-five series to win their first Stanley Cup.\n\nA special meeting was held on September 22, 1925, to discuss expansion to New York City. The NHL approved the dropping of the Hamilton Tigers franchise and the adding of the New York Americans club, which would sign the Hamilton players. The New York franchise was granted to Colonel J. S. Hammond and T. J. Duggan, although the ownership was held secretly by \"Big Bill\" Dwyer, an infamous bootlegger from New York City, to play in New York's Madison Square Garden.\n\nAt the annual meeting on November 7, 1925, the league added another new expansion franchise, in Pittsburgh, the third United States-based team in the NHL. The Ottawa Senators objected to the adding of the team, but were outvoted. The Pittsburgh team, known as the Pirates was formed because former Toronto NHA owner Eddie Livingstone had been again threatening to form a rival league and mentioned Pittsburgh as one of the possible franchise locations. League president Frank Calder and the governors quickly agreed to grant the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets organization an NHL franchise, known as the Pittsburgh Pirates, like the baseball club. Odie Cleghorn left the Canadiens to sign on as playing-coach with Pittsburgh.\n\nTommy Gorman and Ted Dey sold their interests in the Ottawa Senators to T. Franklin Ahearn. Ahearn then hired a successful junior executive, Dave Gill, to be secretary-treasurer (general manager) of the team and Gill hired Alex Curry, a former Senators player in the old NHA, to coach the team. Gorman joined the Americans' organization.\n\nThe league imposed a salary cap of $35,000 per team in an effort to curb player's salaries. The Pittsburgh Pirates' Lionel Conacher was paid $7,500 for the season, the Montreal Maroons' Dunc Munro was also paid $7,500, the New York Americans' Billy Burch was paid $6,500, the Americans' Joe Simpson, and the Toronto Maple Leafs' Hap Day were paid $6,000.\n\nThe Hamilton Tigers had spent their first five seasons in the NHL in last place until last season where they went from worst to first. The success enjoyed by the Tigers players was not carried over to New York, though, as the Americans finished fifth overall with a record of 12–20–4.\n\nEddie Gerard improved the Montreal Maroons by signing Nels Stewart and Babe Siebert and signing former Olympian Dunc Munro for defence. The Maroons were on their way to glory. Nels Stewart not only set a record for goals by a first-year player, but became the first rookie to win the scoring title. Stewart also won the Hart Trophy as league MVP. Stewart's record of 34 goals remains an NHL record for rookies until 1970–71.\n\nFrom the 1910–11 season Georges Vezina had been the Montreal Canadiens goaltender, and had led them to the Cup in 1916 and 1924. In the first game of this season, he collapsed on the ice as the second period got underway. It was found he had tuberculosis, and he died in March 1926. The Canadiens would finish last in the standings and miss the playoffs.\n\nOttawa's coach Curry was quite successful, as he took a team that had gone from fourth overall to first with an impressive record of 24–8–4, and the expansion Pittsburgh Pirates, with a strong cast of ex-amateurs led by future Hall of Famers Roy Worters and Lionel Conacher, finished third. The Pirates introduced \"on-the-fly\" player substitution to the NHL, a practice already in use in the Western League.\n\n\nThe first regular-season game at Madison Square Garden between the Montreal Canadiens and the expansion New York Americans was a big event. Opening ceremonies included performances by the Governor-General's Bodyguard Band of Ottawa and the United States Military Band from West Point, displays of 'fancy skating', a miniature game between the team's mascots and the opening faceoff was made by New York Mayor John F. Hylan and Tex Rickard. The attendance was 19,000 and the ticket prices ranged from $1.50 to $11.50. Gate receipts were donated to the Neurological Society of New York. Montreal won the game, officiated by Cooper Smeaton 3–1, and were awarded the new Prince of Wales Trophy. (The Trophy would subsequently be given as an award to the NHL playoff champions.)\n\nThis is the last season that saw challengers from outside of the NHL compete for the Stanley Cup. At the beginning of the season, the Western Canada Hockey League renamed itself the Western Hockey League because one of its teams, the Regina Capitals, had moved to the States to play in Portland, Oregon. They were renamed the Portland Rosebuds.\n\nOnce again, the Victoria Cougars finished third in their league but once again won their league championship and the right to play for the Stanley Cup. The previous season, the Cougars beat the Montreal Canadiens for the Stanley Cup with that being the only time in NHL history in which a non-NHL team won the Cup. After the 1926 playoffs, the Western Hockey League would fold leaving the Stanley Cup entirely to the NHL. The Cup would never again be contested by a non-NHL team. This was also the only season in NHL history where the number of playoff berths was less than half of the number of teams in the league and is the most recent season in which none of the Original Six qualified for the playoffs (as of 2016).\n\nThe second seed Montreal Maroons beat the third seed Pittsburgh Pirates and then went on to beat first place Ottawa Senators two goals to one in a two-game \"total goals\" series, thus capturing the O'Brien Cup, Prince of Wales Trophy and the right to play the Victoria Cougars for the Stanley Cup.\n\nNels Stewart was \"Old Poison\" to the Victoria Cougars, as he scored six goals in the four games and goaltender Clint Benedict shut out the westerners three times.\n\nThe new Prince of Wales Trophy was introduced this season. It was first presented to the Montreal Canadiens as winners of the first game in the new Madison Square Garden. The Trophy was then intended to be used as a new trophy to be awarded to the champions of the National Hockey League. The existing O'Brien Cup, given also to the league champions, was not retired. Nels Stewart won the Hart for the first time in his career. Frank Nighbor won his second consecutive Lady Byng Trophy.\n\n\"Note: GP = Games played; G = Goals; A = Assists; Pts = Points\"\n\nSource: NHL.\n\n\"GP = Games played, GA = Goals against, SO = Shutouts, GAA = Goals against average\"\n\"Note: GP = Games played; G = Goals; A = Assists; Pts = Points\"\n\nThe following is a list of players of note who played their first NHL game in 1925–26 (listed with their first team, asterisk(*) marks debut in playoffs):\n\nThe following is a list of players of note that played their last game in the NHL in 1925–26 (listed with their last team):\n\n\n\n"}

He was one of the \"Navaratnas\" in Akbar's 'darbar' (court).\n\nTodar Mal was born in the city of Laharpur in present-day Uttar Pradesh in a Hindu family, considered by historians as either Agarwal, Khatri or Kayastha.\n\nTodar Mal's father died when he was very young leaving no means of livelihood for him. Todar Mal started his career from the humble position of a writer but slowly moved up the ranks when the Sher Shah Suri, committed him to the charge of building a new fort of Rohtas in Punjab with the objective of preventing Ghakkar raids and to also act as a barrier to the Mughals in the north-west.\n\nAfter the Sur dynasty was overthrown by the Mughals, Todar Mal continued in the service of the ruling power, which was now the Mughal Emperor Akbar. Under Akbar, he was placed in charge of Agra. Later, he was made governor of Gujarat. At various times, he also managed Akbar's Mint at Bengal and served in Punjab. Todar Mal's most significant contribution, which is appreciated even today, is that he overhauled the revenue system of Akbar's Mughal empire. Raja Todarmal built a fortress-palace at Laharpur in the Sitapur district of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nBeveridge records that Raja Todar Mal had got leave from Akbar and was on his way to Haridwar, but he received a letter from Akbar in which the latter is said to have written that \"it was better to go on working and doing good to the world than to go on a pilgrimage.\" Todar Mal also translated Bhagavata Purana into Persian.\n\nFollowing Todar Mal's death on 8 November 1589 in Lahore, his body was cremated according to the Hindu traditions. Raja Bhagwan Das, his colleague in the charge of Lahore, was present at the ceremony. Of his two sons, Dhari was killed in a battle in Sindh. Another son, Kalyan Das, was sent by Todar Mal to subdue the Raja of Kumaon in the Himalayas. He rose to become the Finance Minister in Akbar's Darbar.\n\nTodar Mal is recognized as an able warrior, who led in various battles.\n\nTodar Mal succeeded Khwaja Malik I'timad Khan in 1560. Raja Todar Mal introduced standard weights and measures, a land survey and settlement system, revenue districts and officers. This system of maintenance by Patwari is still used in Indian Subcontinent which was improved by British Raj and Government of India.\n\nRaja Todar Mal, as finance minister of Akbar, introduced a new system of revenue known as \"zabt\" and a system of taxation called \"dahshala\".\n\nHe took a careful survey of crop yields and prices cultivated for a 10-year period 1570–1580. On this basis, tax was fixed on each crop in cash. Each province was divided into revenue circles with their own rates of revenue and a schedule of individual crops. This system was prevalent where the Mughal administration could survey the land and keep careful accounts. For the revenue system, Akbar's territory was divided into 15 Subahs, which were further subdivided into a total of 187 Sarkars across 15 subahs, and those 197 sarkars (sirkar) were further subdivided into a total of 3367 Mahals or Pargana. Several Mahals were grouped into Dasturs, a unit between Mahal and Sirkar. Portion of larger Mahal or Pargana was called \"taraf\". Mahals was subdivided into standardised Bighas. A Bigha was made of 3600 Ilahi Gaj, which is roughly half of modern acre. Unit of measurement was standardised to \"Ilahi Gaj\", which was equivalent to 41 fingers (29-32 inches). Lead measuring rope, called Tenab, was also standardised by joining pieces of Bamboo with iron rings so that the length of Tenab did not vary with seasonal changes.\n\nThis system was not applicable in the provinces like Gujarat and Bengal.\n\nTodar Mal died in Lahore on 8 November 1589.\n\nThe Kashi Vishwanath Temple was rebuilt in 1585 by Todar Mal.\n\nIn the historical serial, Bharat Ek Khoj, Todar Mal was played by popular character actor, Harish Patel in the two episodes (Episodes 32 and 33) on the life and times of Emperor Akbar.\n\nTodar Mal is featured in the video games \"Sid Meier's Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword\", \"Sid Meier's Civilization V: Gods and Kings\", and most recently in Sid Meier's Civilization VI as a \"great merchant\".\n\nIn the Indian movie Jodhaa Akbar, Raja Todar Mal is portrayed by Pramod Moutho.\nIn the Indian historical fiction television series Jodha Akbar, Todar Mal is portrayed by Shaurya Singh.\n\n\n\n"}

The next year, he became a monk of the Benedictine community of Downside Abbey – a House of the English Benedictine Congregation – and was ordained priest there in 1933. In 1946 the community elected him as their Abbot, which he remained for twenty years until his consecration in 1966 as Titular Bishop of Nova Barbara and Auxiliary Bishop to Cardinal John Carmel Heenan in the Archdiocese of Westminster.\n\nButler's wide-reaching interests and competence included theology, spirituality, contemplative prayer, ecumenism, the Church Fathers and the dialogue with contemporaries such as Bernard Lonergan.\n\nDefending – like his predecessor Abbot John Chapman and his fellow-monks, Dom Bernard Orchard and Dom Gregory Murray – the traditionally maintained priority of the Gospel according to Matthew, Butler published a critique of the Two-document hypothesis and a study of the indebtedness of the Gospel according to Luke to the Gospel according to Matthew (cf.

The proposal was rejected with 60.9 percent voting against, vs. 39.1 percent in favour, in the 2009 vote.\n\nIn 2003, the Liberal government of Premier Gordon Campbell, with the agreement of the opposition New Democratic Party, established a Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform, mandating it to propose a new electoral system, which would subsequently be put to referendum. The assembly designed and recommended a system that it named BC-STV (British Columbia Single Transferable Vote), as described in the Assembly's Final Report. A referendum was held on that recommendation in conjunction with the 2005 BC election.\n\nThe law governing STV advertising changed after the 2005 referendum. Although it was included as a referendum on the May 12, 2009, ballot, STV promotion was banned from election advertising.\n\nThe \"BC Electoral Reform Referendum 2009 Act Regulation Section.29.4\" (STV gag law) reads:\nReferendum advertising must not, directly or indirectly, (a) promote or oppose a registered political party or the election of a candidate, or (b) form part of election advertising. Section.1 definition -- \"referendum campaign period\" means, in relation to the referendum, the period beginning on February 1, 2009 and ending at the close of general voting for the referendum.\n\nThe referendum was presented as a Yes/No question, with a Yes vote leading to adoption of BC-STV, and a No vote leading to retention of the existing single-member plurality system. However, the government also legislated that the referendum results would not be binding unless a supermajority of 60 percent of the voters voted the same way (and also formed a simple majority in at least 60 percent (48 of 79) of British Columbia's electoral districts).\n\nWhile a simple majority of voters in 97 percent of the electoral districts (77 of 79) voted to support the adoption of the BC-STV system, in the province-wide popular vote 57.69 percent of the population voted to support BC-STV, falling 2.3 percent short of the government-set requirement for the result to be binding.\nConsequently, the results of the referendum were not binding on the government, and the government did not take any steps to adopt the BC-STV system. However, a decision was taken to hold a second referendum, given how close the results were.\n\nA second referendum on electoral reform was held in conjunction with the provincial election on 12 May 2009. The BC-STV electoral system was again voted on by the British Columbia electorate. To be binding, similar to 2005, the referendum required 60 per cent overall approval and 50 per cent approval in at least 60 per cent of the province's electoral districts. Partially addressing concerns expressed during and after the first referendum campaign, voters were able to consult a map of proposed electoral boundaries under the BC-STV system, and advocacy groups were given some public funding to campaign for and against the new electoral system.\n\nThe province's voters defeated the change with only 39.09 percent voting in favour.\n\nSince Confederation with Canada in 1871, British Columbia had a system of primarily single-member electoral districts with some multi-member districts. The 17 multi-member ridings were eliminated in 1988.\n\nUnlike the fully single-member system in place since 1988, STV groups all legislative seats regionally into multiple-member electoral districts. This is done so that seats in the region can be allocated in a way that reflects the distribution of votes among the electorate. For example, Richmond and Delta's five existing constituencies would be combined into one electoral district which would produce five winners, proportional to the votes in the multi-member district. It is very unlikely that all would be from the same party, in contrast to the situation in the 1996 election, when all five of these seats were won by the same political party.\n\nPolitical parties may nominate as many candidates in an electoral district as there are available seats, although experience with STV elsewhere (and all elections in general) suggests that not all will do so. For instance, in Ireland where five or more parties run candidates, a five-seat district would typically have about 10 or 15 candidates. Major parties will typically nominate more candidates in a district than will minor parties, as they will be hopeful of electing a larger number of MLAs.\n\nThe most important feature of the system is that, although each voter has only one vote, their single vote may be apportioned and used to elect multiple candidates based on the voter's ranked preferences (if any). To this end, the voter is invited to rank-order candidates, although they are not required to do so. The candidates will be grouped by political party in separate columns on the ballot paper, as is the practice in the Australian state of Tasmania. However, voters would be allowed to express preferences for candidates of different parties if they chose to do so.\n\nA quota for the district is determined based on the number of valid ballots cast and the number of seats available in the district. All the votes are counted and sorted by the voters' first preferences. Those candidates with enough first-preference votes to meet or exceed the quota are elected. A multiple-step vote counting and transfer process is then used to determine the winners of the remaining seats in the district by taking voters' secondary preferences into account.\n\nAlthough the processing of secondary votes can be complicated, the Assembly expresses the general principle was explained in the following simplified way in the Assembly's Final Report as follows: \"If a voter's favourite candidate (#1) is not elected, or has more votes than are needed to be elected, then the voter's vote is \"moved\" to his or her next most favourite candidate (#2). The vote is transferred rather than wasted. The aim of this system is to make all votes count\" (Final Report, p. 6).\n\nUnder the current first past the post or FPTP system, British Columbians elected members from 79 one-member districts in 2005, but this has expanded to 85 for the 2009 election. Boundaries commissions, appointed after alternate elections, use census data to maintain a nominally uniform population level across districts (within court-mandated bounds) so that voters have approximately equal representation. Currently, districts have a mean population of about 50,000. However, there can be considerable discrepancies between electoral districts, because districts are permitted to be as small as 75 percent or as large as 125 percent of the provincial average, and even these bounds may be exceeded in special circumstances. Moreover, population migrations between redistrictings can lead to further drift away from uniformity. Vancouver-Burrard has the largest population at about 67,000 people and North Coast has the smallest population at about 27,000 people.\n\nOne of the criticisms of this method of is that in many populous communities, in order to create districts with a population of approximately 50,000, it may be necessary to draw arbitrary boundaries which do not necessarily reflect a community of interest.\n\nThe Electoral Boundaries Commission which reported in 2008 was charged with drawing up new boundaries for both the single-member system and the proposed new BC-STV system. Under BC-STV, much larger districts would be created that will elect multiple members. Proponents argue that this creates districts with a stronger sense of community and common interest, in which voters will have several MLAs and can get service or representation from any of them. For example, the 11 new single-member constituencies within the municipality of Vancouver would be combined under STV to form two electoral districts, one West, one East. The five electoral districts within Richmond and Delta will be combined to form one electoral district. Each STV district is formed by amalgamating a collection of single-member constituencies; therefore the total number of MLAs per region, and the population per MLA within each region, is independent of the choice of system.\n\nThe proposed BC-STV system was chosen by the members of the Citizens' Assembly to best suit B.C. However, it has specific similarities to and distinctions from STV electoral systems currently being used in other countries:\n\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1939 as a tool and die forging plant, the company now consists of Taurus Armas, its firearm division, as well as other divisions focusing on metals manufacturing, plastics, body armors, helmets and civil construction.\n\nTaurus produced its first revolver, the Model 38101SO, in 1941. Beginning in 1968, it exported revolvers to the U.S. market through a series of importers.\n\nIn 1971, the Bangor Punta Corporation, then the parent company of Smith & Wesson, purchased 54 percent of Forjas Taurus, allowing the two firearms manufacturers to easily share information regarding design and manufacturing. In 1977, Taurus was purchased from Bangor Punta by its current owners, and its ties to Smith & Wesson were severed.\n\nIn 1980, after Italian arms manufacturer Beretta had completed its contracts to produce firearms for Brazil's military, Taurus purchased Beretta's São Paulo manufacturing plant along with the tooling, technical drawings, and work force necessary to produce several different pistol designs.\n\nIn order to more effectively tap the U.S. market, the company created a subsidiary, Taurus International Manufacturing Incorporated, also known as Taurus USA, in 1984.\n\nIn 1997 Forjas Taurus purchased the rights & equipment to manufacture Rossi brand revolvers. They currently manufacture three .38 Special models and four .357 Magnum models under the Rossi name, manufactured in São Leopoldo, Brazil. In 2012, Heritage Manufacturing was also purchased and its production later moved to Taurus' Miami, Florida plant.\n\nThe current product line includes steel-frame pistols, polymer-frame pistols, revolvers, and law enforcement weapons (submachine guns and rifles), the latter intended for the domestic Brazilian market. The company manufactures and sells its firearms for generally less than other manufacturers due to low labor costs, as well as having the facilities available to build virtually every part themselves.\n\nOne writer said in 2010 that the \"[q]uality of Taurus handguns in the modern era is second to none\". In 2015, Taurus settled a lawsuit for $39 million and recalled nearly one million handguns produced between 1997 and 2013 due to \"safety defects\".\n\nTaurus was originally known for manufacturing revolvers similar in design to those offered by Smith & Wesson. The company moved away from this realm by offering larger framed models such as the Raging Bull (.454 Casull) and Raging Hornet (.22 Hornet) revolvers as well as the Judge 5-shot revolvers (.410 bore and .45 Colt).\n\nOne of Taurus' most successful semiautomatic handguns has been its PT92, a model similar to Beretta's model 92 line, but with the addition of an ambidextrous frame safety, rather than the Beretta's slide-mounted safety.\n\nThe most recent addition to the Taurus pistol lineup is a copy of the Colt 1911 .45 ACP pistol, the PT1911. This slightly redesigned and updated design offers many features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNine of their more popular models manufactured between 1997-2013 have been issued a voluntary recall in 2015. This is around one million pistols and includes the following models.\nA class action settlement has also been agreed to which amounts to almost 39 million dollars due to the defective models.\n\n\n"}

Generally, the lowest ranking members of the crew are required to hot rack. Hot racking is sometimes utilized in jails and prisons to deal with overcrowding.\n\nDepending upon the watch system, two, or even three people may end up sharing the same bunk. The term comes from the military slang use of the term \"rack\" for a bed or bunk. With more than one crew member assigned to a rack, it is possible that a crew member returning from a duty shift will lie down on a rack immediately after it is vacated by another crew member about to start a shift. The rack is therefore said to be \"hot\", that is, still warm from the vacating crew member's body heat.\n\n"}

United of Manchester\n\nFootball Club United of Manchester is a semi-professional football club in Moston, Manchester, England, that competes in , the seventh tier of the English football league system, and plays home matches at Broadhurst Park.\n\nFounded in 2005 by Manchester United supporters opposed to American businessman Malcolm Glazer's takeover, F.C. United entered Division Two of the North West Counties Football League, earned three consecutive promotions and were promoted for a fourth time to National League North for the 2015–16 season. In cup competitions, F.C. United reached the second round of the FA Cup in 2010–11 and the fourth round of the FA Trophy in 2014–15.\n\nAfter ground-sharing between 2005 and 2014 with Bury at Gigg Lane, F.C. United opened their own ground, Broadhurst Park in north-east Manchester, in May 2015. The team was managed by Karl Marginson from its formation in 2005 until October 2017. The current manager is Neil Reynolds, who took over as manager in October 2018 from David Chadwick who acted as temporary manager following Tom Greaves's resignation in August 2018. The club's regular kit colours are red shirts, white shorts and black socks. Their badge is based on the Manchester coat of arms and features a ship at sea and three stripes for the three rivers that flow through Manchester.\n\nF.C. United are the largest fan-owned football club in the United Kingdom by number of members and have one of the highest home attendances in English non-league football. The club is democratically run by its members who have equal voting rights and own one share in the club each.\n\nThe club was founded in 2005 by disaffected supporters of Manchester United. Although there were varying reasons for their dissatisfaction, the catalyst for F.C. United's formation was the 12 May 2005 takeover of Manchester United by American businessman Malcolm Glazer. Supporters first considered forming a breakaway club in 1998 during an attempted takeover of Manchester United by BSkyB. The creation of F.C. United in the event of a Glazer buyout was first proposed in February 2005 by Manchester United fanzine \"Red Issue\".\n\nPublic meetings for fans were held on 19 May 2005 at the Central Methodist Hall in Manchester's Northern Quarter and on 30 May at the Apollo Theatre. Subsequently, a steering group was created to set up the new club. After the name \"F.C. United\" was rejected by The Football Association for being too generic, those who had pledged money to the club were asked to vote on a name. On 14 June 2005, it was announced that \"F.C. United of Manchester\" had been chosen, beating \"A.F.C. Manchester 1878\", \"Manchester Central\", and \"Newton Heath United\", and F.C. United were officially registered with the Manchester County Football Association on the same day.\n\nKarl Marginson was appointed as the club's manager on 22 June, and the club held trials for players four days later. Around 900 players applied to take part in the trials, of whom 200 were chosen to take part and 17 selected to play for F.C. United. Jonathan Mitten, great-nephew of Manchester United forward Charlie Mitten, was the club's first signing.\n\nF.C. United's inaugural members' meeting was held on 5 July 2005 at the Methodist Central Hall. Members voted on the club's constitution, badge, and core principles and elected the 11-member board. By 6 July, over 4,000 people had pledged money to F.C. United and the club had over £100,000 in the bank. During F.C. United's formation, the owners of Leigh RMI offered to merge the two clubs, but the parties decided against the idea. F.C. United later arranged to play their first ever game against Leigh RMI on 16 July 2005; the match ended 0–0.\n\nFor the 2005–06 season, F.C. United played in the Second Division of the North West Counties Football League (NWCFL), which is level ten of the English football league system and nine levels below the Premier League. The club played its home matches at Bury's Gigg Lane. F.C. United were ineligible to play in the FA Vase for their first season because the club was formed after the deadline to enter the competition. They were, however, able to play in the North West Counties League Challenge Cup.\n\nF.C. United's first competitive match was a 5–2 away victory against Leek County School Old Boys on 13 August 2005. 2,590 people attended the game. In its home debut on 20 August, the club defeated Padiham 3–2 with two goals from Rory Patterson. During their first season, F.C. United consistently broke NWCFL attendance records. A crowd of 6,032 watched the team during their final home league match of the season against Great Harwood Town, which remains an NWCFL record . Despite losing that game 0–1, the team were promoted to Division One.\n\nF.C. United's successful 2006/07 season in Division One of the NWCFL earned the club a promotion to Division One North of the Northern Premier League. They secured their second successive league title with a 7–1 win over Atherton Laburnum Rovers on 18 April 2007. They then won their second cup of the season by beating Curzon Ashton 2–1 in the NWCFL's Challenge Cup final. In the third round of the FA Vase competition, the club was eliminated when it lost 2–3 in the last minute of extra-time to Quorn.\n\nIn 2007–08, F.C. United played in the inaugural season of the Northern Premier League (NPL) Division One North. They made their debut in the FA Cup that season, but lost 1–2 to Fleetwood Town in the first qualifying round. They advanced to the final of the 2007–08 NPL President's Cup, in which they beat Radcliffe Borough 2–0 to pick up their fourth trophy in the three years following the club's formation. The club finished the season second in the league, trailing champions Bradford Park Avenue by one point, and entered the play-offs for the other promotion place. After beating Bamber Bridge 3–2 in the semi-finals, F.C. United faced Skelmersdale United in the promotion play-off final, coming back from a goal down to win 4–1 and earn their third successive promotion to play in the Northern Premier League Premier Division.\n\nIn 2008–09, F.C. United made their debut in the FA Trophy, reaching the third qualifying round, and missed out on a play-off place on the last day of the regular season. In the 2009–10 season, they finished 13th in the league, their lowest league position in the first five seasons, before progressing to the play-offs in 2010–11. They beat Bradford Park Avenue 2–0 in the semi-finals but lost the final 0–1 to Colwyn Bay. Earlier that season, F.C. United reached the first round of the FA Cup for the first time, recording victories over Radcliffe Borough, Gainsborough Trinity, Norton & Stockton Ancients and Barrow to play League One side Rochdale. They defeated Rochdale 3–2 after a late winner from Mike Norton, and played eventual 2010–11 League One champions Brighton & Hove Albion in the second round. After a 1–1 away draw at Withdean Stadium, F.C. United lost the replay at Gigg Lane 0–4, in front of their highest home attendance of 6,731.\n\nIn the 2011–12 season, F.C. United reached the first round of the FA Trophy for the first time after knocking out Frickley Athletic, Durham City and Altrincham. In the league, they qualified for the end of season play-offs, despite finishing 6th, due to the demotion of Northwich Victoria for breaching of financial rules. They beat Chorley 2–0 in the play-off semi-final to qualify for consecutive play-off finals but lost 0–1 to Bradford Park Avenue in the penultimate minute of extra time.\n\nF.C. United finished third in the 2012–13 season to book a place in the play-offs. They won 3–1 against Witton Albion in the semi-final, but lost the final for the third consecutive time with a 1–2 defeat to Hednesford Town. The following season, the club finished second in the league but lost in the play-offs in the semi-finals. During the 2014–15 campaign, F.C. United reached the fourth round of the FA Trophy and recorded a streak of 21 league games without a loss from December to April, including 16 victories. They secured their promotion to the National League North following a 1–0 win against Stourbridge on 21 April 2015; after seven years of trying. The club's top scorer for this championship winning season was Tom Greaves, the same player who scored the winning goal for Bradford Park Avenue against F.C. United in the 2012 play-off final.\n\nF.C. United recorded their first victory in the National League North in a 3–2 home win over Brackley Town on 22 August 2015, which was the club's first competitive win at Broadhurst Park. In October, for the second time in the club's history, they secured a place in the first round of the FA Cup with a 3–1 away win over Sporting Khalsa, but were eliminated from the competition after a 1–4 home loss against Chesterfield. In November, the club ended their cup runs for the 2015–16 season after two successive home defeats to Stalybridge Celtic 3–4 in the Manchester Premier Cup and to A.F.C. Telford United 1–2 in the FA Trophy. Between September and November 2015, F.C. United lost seven consecutive league matches; their worst run ever . They eventually finished the season in 13th place.\n\nThe following 2016–17 season, the team again finished 13th and won the Manchester FA county cup for the first time in their history, beating Stalybridge Celtic 1–0 in the final. After a poor start to the 2017–18 season, Karl Marginson, the team's first and only manager, left the club by mutual consent in October 2017. He was replaced by forward Tom Greaves who took over on a temporary basis and was appointed permanent player-manager the next month. F.C. United finished the season in 16th place and retained the Manchester FA county cup with a penalty shoot-out victory against Trafford F.C. Greaves, who became the club's all-time record goal-scorer in December 2017, saw his contract extended until the end of the 2018–19 season.\n\nAfter a poor start to the 2018–19 season, Greaves left the club at the end of August 2018, with long-serving former player David Chadwick acting as interim manager. In late October, the club appointed Neil Reynolds as first team manager. On 22 April 2019, Easter Monday, FC United were relegated back to the Northern Premier League following a 1–2 home defeat to Blyth Spartans.\n\nF.C. United's club colours are red, white and black—the same colours worn by Manchester United. The shirt bears no sponsorship logo, as it was written into the club's constitution that the club should not have a shirt sponsor. The club's first kit was a plain red shirt, white shorts and plain black socks. The club introduced a new home shirt for the 2007–08 season with a striped collar and striped ends on the sleeves which lasted until 2009. This was changed for the 2009–11 seasons to a red shirt with a black and white stripe down the left side, manufactured by Admiral Sportswear. For seasons 2011–13 the club reverted to a plain red shirt, manufactured by O'Neills. At the start of the 2018–19 season, Errea replaced O'Neill's as kit supplier. The club's second kit, worn when playing away against a team with a predominantly red kit, is a white shirt, white shorts and socks. The club has an alternative plain blue kit with the clenched fist logo and the words \"Our Club Our Rules\" on the shirt front for playing against a team with a red and white kit. In past seasons white shirts with diagonal black or red stripes and a white shirt with a red trim, black shorts and white socks have all been used as the second kits.\n\nThe club's badge is red, white, black and yellow, and incorporates elements from the coat of arms of Manchester City Council; a ship representing Manchester's industry and three stripes representing the three rivers that flow through Manchester: the Irk, the Irwell and the Medlock.\n\nF.C. United play at the 4,400 capacity Broadhurst Park, which opened in May 2015. The ground was built at a cost of £6.3 million, using £2 million from a Community Share Scheme and the remainder from a variety of governmental and charity grants. The ground is surrounded on all sides by covered stands: the St. Mary's Road End (east), the North Stand, the Lightbowne Road End (west) and the Main Stand (south), the latter of which has seating sections. Within the Main Stand is a clubhouse with a bar and catering facilities, club offices, changing rooms, a medical suite and a classroom. The stadium is shared with a local junior team, Moston Juniors F.C.\n\nFrom their foundation in 2005 until 2014, F.C. United were based at Bury F.C.'s Gigg Lane stadium. F.C. United's first proposed stadium was announced in 2010 for Newton Heath, the original home of Manchester United. The development was planned to be located on the site of the Ten Acres Lane sports centre and would have cost £3.5 million, to be financed by public donations, a Community Shares issue and grant funding. However a year later, in March 2011, Manchester City Council backed out from funding the stadium. The Broadhurst Park site in Moston, north-east Manchester, was announced in April 2011. Detailed information about the new facility was released in June 2011 and Manchester City Council approved the planning permission for the site on 27 October 2011. F.C. United had to overcome some obstacles including funding agreements, contractor and lease negotiations and a legal challenge from local residents which caused a further two-year delay before building commenced in November 2013.\n\nDuring their time at Bury, fixture clashes meant that F.C. United used a further six stadia for home fixtures: Altrincham's Moss Lane; Radcliffe Borough's Stainton Park; Hyde United's Ewen Fields; Stalybridge Celtic's Bower Fold; Curzon Ashton's Tameside Stadium; and Flixton's Valley Road.\n\nFor the 2014–15 season, F.C. United ended their groundsharing agreement with Bury after nine seasons in preparation for their move to Broadhurst Park. As the ground was not ready at the start of the season, they used Bower Fold as a temporary home. Delays with Broadhurst Park meant that F.C. United were unable to move in until May 2015, and following fixture clashes with Stalybridge Celtic the club moved in December 2014 to the Tameside Stadium for the remainder of the season. F.C. United hosted a test event at Broadhurst Park on 16 May 2015, staging a short match between their first team and an Invitational XI made up of past players. The official opening game was a friendly against Benfica B on 29 May, the anniversary of Manchester United's victory over Benfica in the 1968 European Cup Final. Benfica won the opening game 1–0 in front of a crowd of 4,232.\n\nF.C. United are owned by 5,000 of their members and are the largest supporter-owned football club in the United Kingdom by number of members. Each member can vote on how the club is run, including voting for board members, kit designs and season ticket prices. Most F.C. United supporters still support Manchester United and many were previously season ticket holders at Old Trafford. F.C. United fans are known for the large range of songs that they sing at matches, and the atmosphere created by fans has been praised in the media.\n\nDuring their first season (2005–06), F.C. United had the second-highest average attendance in English non-League football with an average gate of 3,059 and were the 87th best supported club across all divisions. Attendances fell in the next two seasons and they were the 92nd best supported club in 2006–07 and 100th best supported club by 2007–08. Their average league attendance then levelled out at approximately 2,000 per game, before rising to an average of 2,155 in 2014–15, the then-seventh highest attendance in non-League football. After moving to Broadhurst Park in May 2015, the club averaged a gate of 3,394 in 2015–16, a season-on-season increase of over 57% and the fourth highest attendance in non-League football.\n\nF.C. United operate as a community benefit society. Membership is obtained by paying an annual fee of £15 to the club (£3 for children) but each member receives only one share in the club and is entitled to a single vote at meetings, regardless of the amount donated. The board consists of up to 11 members who are elected by the members of the club. Day-to-day operations of the club are overseen by a Chief Executive Officer; Andy Walsh, a founding member of F.C. United, was appointed to the position in 2005. He stepped down from the role at the end of June 2016. Damian Chadwick, another founding member of the club, took up the position in November 2016. Chadwick stood down in 2018 and was replaced by Paul Smith.\n\nThe club's manifesto includes the following core principles:\n\nThe club accepts sponsorship but does not allow sponsors' logos to be displayed on the team's shirts. The club's main sponsor in its inaugural 2005–06 season was the Bhopal Medical Appeal and in the 2006–07 season it was the Williams BMW Group. Between 2011–2016, F.C. United were sponsored by mxData, a Manchester-based mobile app development company. In October 2014, F.C. United became the first football club in the United Kingdom to be accredited as a living wage employer by the Living Wage Foundation.\n\nF.C. United and their founders have been criticised and supported by fans of Manchester United and the media; some fans view those who chose to leave to follow F.C. United as \"traitors\". Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson questioned the loyalty of fans who decided to form the club and the motivation behind the forming of F.C. United in a 2006 book:\n\nFormer Manchester United forward Eric Cantona has supported the club, describing them as \"having a great idea\" and expressing hope that F.C. United will \"become a great club and win the European Cup in 50 years' time\". In 2010, aged 43, he said that he would be prepared to play for the club. Steve Coppell, Manchester United winger between 1975 and 1983, joined the club as a co-owner in April 2016.\n\nF.C. United have been criticised by their own members for abandoning their principles, including agreeing to a photo op with a Conservative Party government minister in October 2015, despite a club policy not to be used for political promotion, and a day after some club members took part in a march against government cuts in Manchester. F.C. United defended the visit as \"an essential part\" of the development of financial vehicles for football fans, arguing that it will help government representatives to better understand the benefits and challenges of social investment.\n\nThe club's programme editor resigned from his position in June 2015 over a one-off price rise of the programme for Broadhurst Park's opening game against Benfica the previous month; a Board decision that was described as breaching the club's founding principle of avoiding outright commercialism. F.C. United were also criticised at the time for a deficit in democracy, transparency and accountability between their officials and the membership.\n\nIn 2016, protests by supporters led to several board members stepping down and an Emergency General Meeting (EGM) to elect a new board was subsequently called. The protests culminated in several fans invading the pitch during the last home game of the 2015–16 season, calling for the remaining board members deemed responsible for the lack of democracy and transparency at the club to resign. Three board members resigned within a week of the on-pitch protest, along with the club's Press and Communications Officer. On 5 June, the EGM took place and a new board of 11 members were elected, leading to \"a sense of progression and an air of optimism\" among the club's members.\n\nThe record for the most appearances for F.C. United is held by Jerome Wright, with 400 . Tom Greaves is the club's all-time record goal-scorer with 102 goals in all competitions, which includes 86 in the league and 16 in cup matches . Six other players, Rory Patterson, Mike Norton, Matthew Wolfenden, Jerome Wright, Simon Carden and Stuart Rudd have also scored more than 50 goals for the club. Rudd holds the record for most goals scored in a single season, having scored 45 goals in the 2006–07 season.\n\nThe largest number of points the team accrued is 112 in the 2006–07 season, and the highest number of goals scored in a season is 157, achieved in 42 matches in 2006–07. The club's best performance in the FA Cup was a second round appearance during the 2010–11 season. After a 3–2 first round win over Rochdale, F.C. United recorded a 1–1 away draw with Brighton & Hove Albion, forcing a home replay which they lost 0–4. The team advanced to the first round of the FA Cup again in 2015–16 but lost 1–4 at Broadhurst Park to Chesterfield.\n\nIn the 2006–07 season, F.C. United reached the third round of the FA Vase, beating Padiham and Salford City in the first two rounds but lost 2–3 at home to Quorn after extra time. In the 2014–15 season, they progressed to the fourth round of the FA Trophy, defeating Harrogate Town, Chorley and A.F.C. Fylde in the first three rounds before losing 0–1 away to Torquay United.\n\nThe club's record league victory was a 10–2 win over Castleton Gabriels on 10 December 2005 in the North West Counties Football League Division Two; Simon Carden scored five of the goals, which is the club record for the highest number of goals scored by a player in a single game. F.C. United achieved eight-goal victory margins on three further occasions, in 8–0 wins over Squires Gate, Glossop North End and Nelson, all during the 2006–07 season. The club's heaviest league defeat is 0–6 away to Harrogate Town on 10 March 2018 in the National League North.\n\nF.C. United's highest home attendances are 6,731 against Brighton in the second round of the 2010–11 FA Cup on 8 December 2010 and 6,023 against Great Harwood Town in the North West Counties Football League Division Two on 22 April 2006, both at Gigg Lane.\n\n \n\n\"See \" to see a list of notable F.C. United players, past and present.\n\nF.C. United have assisted in providing several players for the international football scene; the club's all-time record goal-scorer Rory Patterson went on to play and score for Northern Ireland at senior level and forward Matthew Walwyn debuted for Saint Kitts and Nevis in a friendly against Andorra in November 2015. F.C. United's youth team were represented in the England Schoolboys squad by Scott Cheetham in 2011 and in 2013, the club signed Pakistan international defender Amjad Iqbal from Bradford Park Avenue.\n\n\nUpon its formation, F.C. United appointed Karl Marginson as its manager. He led the team to four promotions, three league titles, two league cups and a county cup. He left the club by mutual consent in October 2017 after a poor start to the 2017–18 season. He was replaced by forward Tom Greaves who took on the role of a caretaker player-manager, a decision that was made permanent on 21 November 2017. He was subsequently replaced by Dave Chadwick as Caretaker Manager in August 2018 when he resigned.\n\nF.C. United have won three league titles, two league cups and two county cups in their history.\n\n\n\nF.C. United's women's team competed for the first time in the 2012–13 season. They finished second in the Greater Manchester Women's Football League behind Manchester City Ladies. They also reached the GMWFL League Cup final but lost 0–1 to Manchester City Ladies. After finishing runners-up again in 2013–14, the team won a league and cup double in 2015, gaining promotion to the North West Women's Regional Football League Division One South. They finished runners-up in the two following seasons, behind MSB Woolton Ladies in 2015–16 and Merseyrail Bootle in 2016–17, winning a league and county cup in the latter season. In 2017–18, the team won their first Treble, defending the league and county cups and securing a promotion to the North West Women's Regional Football League Premier Division after an unbeaten league campaign.\n\n"}

Cattermole was a member of the group S Club 7, but left the group in 2002. Between 2008 and 2015 he also was member of spin-off group S Club 3.\n\nCattermole was born in St Albans, Hertfordshire. He was a member of the National Youth Music Theatre and appeared in \"Pendragon\" (1994). He studied theatre. Simon Fuller picked him for S Club 7.\n\nCattermole became a member of S Club 7 after a series of auditions, along with members Tina Barrett, Jon Lee, Bradley McIntosh, Jo O'Meara, Hannah Spearritt and Rachel Stevens in 1999. During five years they released four number one singles and one number one album. They also had a series of TV shows, which were: Miami 7, L.A. 7, Hollywood 7 and Viva S Club. The group rose to fame by starring in their own BBC television series, \"Miami 7\", in 1999. Over the five years they were together, S Club 7 had four UK No.1 singles, one UK No.1 album, a string of hits throughout Europe, including a top-ten single in the United States, Asia, Latin America and Africa.\n\nThey recorded a total of four studio albums, released eleven singles and went on to sell over fourteen million albums worldwide. Their first album, \"S Club\", had a strong 1990s pop sound, similar to many artists of their time. However, through the course of their career, their musical approach changed to a more dance and R&B sound. The concept and brand of the group was created by Simon Fuller, also their manager through 19 Entertainment; they were signed to Polydor Records. Their television series went on to last four series, seeing the group travel across the United States and eventually ending up in Barcelona, Spain.\n\nIt became popular in 100 different countries where the show was watched by over 90 million viewers. As well as the popularity of their television series, S Club 7 won two Brit Awards—in 2000 for British breakthrough act and in 2002, for best British single. In 2001, the group earned the Record of the year. Cattermole stayed with the band until June 2002, featuring in four out of thirteen episodes of the group's final television series, \"Viva S Club\", and performing his final concert with the group for Party at the Palace, which was part of Queen Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee celebrations.\n\nIn October 2014, it was confirmed that the original lineup would reunite for the first time in over a decade for BBC Children in Need. S Club 7 announced their plans for an arena reunion tour, promptly entitled Bring It All Back 2015, which toured the UK in May 2015.\n\nIn June 2002 Cattermole reunited with his old school friends and formed the nu metal band Skua — described as having a \"Limp Bizkit vibe\" as well as comparing their style to Rage Against the Machine. The band split in 2003, after they failed to sign with a record label and the number of shows was low.\n\nIn January 2014 Skua reformed. On 14 July the band released their first single, \"Falling\". On 20 July, the released another two singles, \"Got Not Choice\" and \"Out Of Control\". Their debut album, \"Kneel\", was released on 14 October. Due to commitments with S Club 7's reunion, Skua found themselves lacking a frontman and the project halted having only released one album. The album was promoted only by the band themselves mainly via social media, no record labels were involved.\n\nAfter a five-year on hiatus, it was announced in October 2008 that O'Meara, Cattermole, and McIntosh were to perform as S Club 3. The group consisted of a series of university and nightclub gigs, where they performed a set list consisting of a selection of songs from their \"Greatest Hits\" album. This had been performing in various nightclubs, universities and Butlins holiday camps around the United Kingdom. Cattermole sang with his own band at a charity concert called 'The Sounds of Summer' at 'The Lord Taverners' club in London on 27 July 2011. Barrett joined the group for one performance in March 2014.\n\nAfter the S Club 7 full reunion tour, O'Meara, McIntosh and Barrett continued to perform together as S Club Party, but Cattermole decided to leave the group and took a new hiatus from his artistic career.\n\nCattermole and Hannah Spearritt first met as members of the National Youth Music Theatre in 1994. At the time Paul was 17 years old, and Hannah was 14. They appeared together in \"Pendragon\". In 1999, Cattermole and Spearritt both were selected as members of a seven-member pop group named S Club 7, where they became good friends. In May 2001, the friendship developed into romantic relationship. They kept their relationship a secret for the first six months, waiting until November 2001 to make a public announcement. Their S Club colleagues were supportive of the relationship. Cattermole departed from the band in 2002 but the couple continued to date until early 2006. In June 2015, Cattermole and Spearritt started a romantic relationship again, splitting in November the same year.\n\nIn January 2018 Cattermole auctioned Brit Award for Best British Breakthrough Act up on eBay, saying \"there are bills to pay.\" He had been declared bankrupt in 2014 and when selling his award admitted he had been unsuccessful in obtaining work in reality TV. The award eventually closed at £66,100, and Cattermole also listed his 2002 Brit for \"Don't Stop Movin'\" (Best British Single). The latter hit the same figures, but was ultimately relisted to eventually sell for a more modest £3,000. Cattermole said that half of the payments would go towards paying bills, but was still deciding what to do with the other half.\n\nIn February 2018 in an interview with \"Loose Women\", Cattermole revealed his desire to become a contestant on celebrity reality TV shows and stated the depth of his financial burden and thanked the TV producers for giving him a shirt to wear for the interview. Cattermole also stated during this interview that he is single and interested in finding love.\n\nIn September 2019, he appeared on the dating show \"First Dates Hotel\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1895960", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1895960", "title": "Winky Wright", "text": "Winky Wright\n\nRonald Lamont \"Winky\" Wright (born November 26, 1971) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 1990 to 2012. He is a two-time light middleweight world champion and remains the last to hold the undisputed title at that weight. In his later career he also challenged for a unified middleweight world title. He announced his retirement from boxing in 2012, following a loss to Peter Quillin.\n\nIn 2005, \"The Ring\" magazine ranked him as the world's second best active boxer, pound for pound. In 2017, it was announced that Wright had been elected as an International Boxing Hall of Fame member in the Modern Category, alongside Vitali Klitschko and Érik Morales, with the induction ceremony scheduled for June 2018.\n\nAfter his second-round knockout of Carlos Santana on July 30, 1992, in St. Petersburg, Florida, the ring announcer called him \"Winky\" Wright, the name given to him by his grandmother when he was 6 months old and that had unofficially stuck with him since he was 18 months old. The nickname stuck with him for the rest of his career following his win over Santana.\n\nBig time promoters like Don King and Lou Duva would not promote Wright in the early part of his career. His first big time promoters were the French-based Acaries brothers, who struck a deal for Wright to fight Darryl Lattimore in Luxembourg on January 1, 1993. Wright knocked Lattimore down three times, and the fight was stopped. Wright went on a tear during his tour of Europe, winning 8 straight in France, Germany, Monte Carlo, only fighting in the United States once over the next year.\n\nOn August 21, 1994, Wright received his first title match against WBA light-middleweight champion Julio César Vásquez in Saint-Jean-de-Luz, France. Although he was 25–0 at the time, Wright had not fought in a match that had gone more than 8 rounds. His inexperience showed as Winky lost a unanimous decision, with Vasquez knocking down Wright in the second, seventh and ninth rounds, as well as twice in the twelfth round (Wright also officially slipped 3 times during the fight and 4 times unofficially). However, the decision proved controversial, as Vasquez only won the fight on the knockdowns he scored (with Wright appearing to win every round (except the third round, which appeared to be even) that Vasquez didn't knock him down in) and that the knockdown (which was the first knockdown) in the second round was a controversial variation of a slip (the one unofficial slip in the fight), which would mean that if it wasn't controversially ruled a knockdown, Wright would've narrowly won the fight on the scorecards (on a one-point margin): 112–111. Vasquez however, won on the three official cards: 115–110, 114–110, and 113–110; meaning Vasquez would have won regardless of whether the second round knockdown was scored a slip or not. Wright would have had to have several of the knockdowns reversed to have gotten a legitimate decision victory.\n\nHowever though on February 4, 1995, Wright would bounce back in his typical fashion, defeating Tony Marshall by unanimous decision to win the vacant NABF light-middleweight title.\n\nWright continued fighting in Europe, only fighting in the United States once, until his unanimous decision victory against Andrew Council on March 5, 1996. His impressive win opened the door to fight WBO light-middleweight champion Bronco McKart, a fight Wright won by split decision. Wright successfully defend his title in England three times; twice in Manchester against local fighters Ensley Bingham and Steve Foster, and Adrian Dodson in London.\n\nWright then traveled to South Africa where he lost his world title in controversial circumstances to the undefeated Harry Simon. After a very close contest the fight was initially ruled a draw, then minutes later changed to a majority decision win for Simon due to an apparent scoring error.\n\nHe stopped working with the Acaries brothers in 1999, stating that he was tired of all the travelling. He went on to knock out Derrick Graham in the third round in Miami, Florida. Wright then challenged IBF light-middleweight champion Fernando Vargas. Although some ringside fans and members of the media felt that Wright had won the fight, Vargas ended up winning a controversial majority decision. Harold Lederman (a ringside boxing broadcaster for HBO whose job is to unofficially score fights) scored the bout 115–113, for Wright.\n\nWright continued to defend the NABF and won the USBA light-middleweight title in another decision over Bronco McKart.\n\nFélix Trinidad's jump to the middleweight division left the IBF light-middleweight title vacant. Wright scored a unanimous decision over Robert Frazier on October 12, 2001 to win the vacant title. In his first defense on February 2, 2002, Wright stopped Jason Papillion in the fifth round. He took a third fight against Bronco McKart, which ended in controversy as the referee disqualified McKart for repeated low blows in the 8th round.\n\nFor Wright's next fight, Oscar De La Hoya offered to fight him. However, because of the lack of money The Golden Boy was willing to give Wright for the fight, the deal fell through and Oscar fought Luis Ramon Campas for the WBA/WBC titles. Wright went on to debut on National Television Las Vegas against Juan Carlos Candelo on March 1, 2003 in a title defense, winning a unanimous decision. He followed that up with another blowout victory over Angel Hernandez 8 months later.\n\nTo the surprise of many, including Wright, Shane Mosley challenged Winky to a light-middleweight unification title fight on March 13, 2004. Mosley was a celebrated fighter coming off his second win against Oscar De La Hoya and was looking for a tune-up fight to prepare for a super fight with Félix Trinidad. Shane had stated that he wanted to fight the winner of the fight between Wright and Angel Hernandez. Wright, being the winner, earned a fight with Shane Mosley. Wright was a 4 to 1 underdog against Mosley. During the fight, Wright pressed his will early on and discouraged Mosley with his size, effective jabbing and defense. Winky won a lopsided unanimous decision, unifying his IBF title with Mosley's \"Lineal\"/\"The Ring\"/WBC/WBA titles, to become undisputed light middleweight champion.\n\nThe rematch took place on November 20, 2004. This fight was much closer because Winky deliberately gave away some of the rounds and even dropped his hands in one round, in order to show that Mosley couldn't hurt him. Two judges scored 115–113 for Wright and one judge scored the bout a draw. Wright was awarded the majority decision, which despite Wright blatantly giving away a few of the rounds, was still a decisive victory in his favour. Soon after, Wright would vacate his titles to move up to the middleweight division to challenge Félix Trinidad.\n\nOn May 14, 2005, with Wright once again playing the underdog role, he easily defeated Félix Trinidad by unanimous decision. Wright credits this fight as his greatest achievement in his career as he earned the respect and fan base of many that Félix Trinidad had behind him. Trinidad was a fan favorite and a feared power puncher and many figured he would be able to knock Wright out. But Wright's signature style defence and piston-like jab was too much for the Puerto Rican hero as Trinidad was having trouble landing punches throughout the fight (Two judges scored the fight 119–108 and one judge scored it 120–107). As a result of his dominant victory over such a highly regarded opponent, many placed Wright among the top pound-for-pound boxers in the world. His victory would send Trinidad into his second retirement for three years.\n\nTrinidad-Wright was also a WBC middleweight eliminator, giving Wright a shot at undisputed middleweight champion Jermain Taylor for his titles.\n\nAfter winning a unanimous decision over Sam Soliman in December 2005, Wright faced off against undisputed middleweight champion Jermain Taylor on June 17, 2006, at the FedEx Forum in Memphis, Tennessee for the \"Lineal\"/\"The Ring\"/WBC/WBO titles. In a very close fight, the match was ruled a draw. Two judges scored the bout 115–113 for each fighter, while the final judge scored it 114–114. Both camps attempted at negotiating a rematch, but talks failed after neither side could agree on how to split the money—a problem attributed to Wright's insistence on parity and Taylor's reluctance to give 50 percent to a challenger.\n\nWright returned to defeat Ike Quartey at middleweight by a unanimous twelve-round decision at St. Pete Times Forum, Tampa, Florida in December 2006. Two judges scored the fight 117–110, and one had the bout 117–109, all for Wright.\n\nWright's next fight came against Bernard Hopkins at a catch weight of 170 pounds on July 21, 2007. The bout aired on HBO pay-per-view. In the early rounds of the fight, there was no love lost as Hopkins outpointed Wright until a clash of heads (ruled unintentional) by Hopkins left a deep gash over Wright's eyebrow leading to Wright becoming the aggressor in the fight. Now fighting with a sense of urgency, Wright gave Hopkins problems due to his tight defense guarding the cut and landing combinations from the outside. Hopkins seemed to stick through the pressure and land flush combinations targeting the bloody eye. Hopkins won via unanimous decision on the judges' score cards (116–112, 117–111, 117–111).\n\nIt was Winky's first loss in eight years. In the post-fight interview, Wright was asked why he took the fight. He responded by saying, \"I wanted to show everybody that I'm the best fighter out there, regardless of weight. If I fight the best, then I'll be the best.\"\n\nWright ended a 21-month layoff when he faced former welterweight title holder Paul \"The Punisher\" Williams in a middleweight bout at Mandalay Bay, Las Vegas in April 2009. Wright lost via decision. Two judges scored the bout 119–109 for Williams while the 3rd judge scored the bout 120–108 for Williams. Wright won only the 5th round on two judges cards, while the 3rd judge scored all the rounds for Paul Williams.\n\nAfter several failed attempts to stay active after the one-sided sweep by Paul Williams, Wright decided to get surgery on his knee during his inactivity, in the summer of 2010. Wright's most recent attempts were to get fights with Middleweight Champion Sergio Martínez, who knocked out Williams, and also a 160 lb. fight with Kelly Pavlik. He, however, successfully landed a fight with contender Grady Brewer on December 11, 2009 in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Wright and Brewer were ready and set to do battle until weeks before the fight, the promoters shut the PPV matchup down due to poor ticket sales.\n\nOn November 16, 2010, it surfaced on the internet that Wright's grandmother, Mary Dorsey, had died on November 3. When asked to give his thoughts on what had happened, Winky credited his grandmother for everything he had accomplished during his boxing career, in which he primarily stated that he wouldn't have been world champion if it wasn't for her. After the new year of 2011, Wright came out and gave his side and strategies to the Super Fight between Shane Mosley and Manny Pacquiao. During the interview, he also stated that he'll be coming back to fight on April 9 on the undercard of Marques-Morales against Matthew Macklin. Although it was not a title fight, both fighters have hopes that with the win over each other, they would have a shot at the Middleweight Champion Sergio Martínez at 160 lbs. Once again, weeks before the PPV the fight had to be canceled due to an injury to Winky's right hand.\n\nShortly after the showdown between Bernard Hopkins and Chad Dawson was made, it was stated that Dawson would not be working with trainer Emanuel Steward and instead would work with his previous trainer John Scully. Wright, being a good friend of Dawson's, offered to help him on his upcoming fight while getting him into physical shape. He stated in a brief, short interview, \"No, I'm not a trainer and I'm not training Dawson. The fighting part of my career isn't even over, why would I want to start training? I'm just there to give advice and pointers to Dawson. Help him prepare for Hopkins and his dirty tactics. Hopkins is a dirty fighter.\" In an October interview, he stated that he will once again be coming back stating, \"The junior middleweight division is full of people that call themselves champions when they ain't fought nobody. I'm coming back to take what's rightfully mine.\" He also stated that he'd made a mistake with just coming back and taking on a fighter like Paul Williams. He confirmed that he's going to take a couple tune-up fights hoping to grab one by December. He also, in the interview, he expressed interest in fighting WBA Light Middleweight Champion Miguel Cotto, WBC Light Middleweight Champion Saul Alvarez and \"The Ring\" Middleweight Champion Sergio Martínez in the future.\n\nAfter a 3-year hiatus from boxing, Wright was expected to face Peter Quillin on May 26, 2012, but the date was changed to June 2, 2012 in order to satisfy the California State Athletic Commission. Quillin defeated Wright via a ten-round unanimous decision. Wright announced his retirement shortly after the fight.\n\nWright has appeared in music videos for Busta Rhymes' \"Touch It Remix\" (feat. Mary J. Blige, Missy, Rah Digga, Lloyd Banks, Papoose, DMX) 50 Cent's \"Outta Control Remix\" (feat. Mobb Deep) Jamie Foxx's \"DJ Play a Love Song\" (feat. Twista) and 2 Pistols's \"She Got It\" (feat. T-Pain). He also appeared briefly in the cult hit \"State Property 2\" along with Dame Dash and Beanie Sigel.\n\nWright has previously entered into ventures and endorsements with brands such as Reebok, Vitamin Water, Rocawear, State Property and 2(x)ist men's underwear among many others. Through these partnerships, Wright has appeared in television commercials and ad campaigns around New York City and in \"Men's Fitness\", \"Men's Health\", \"VIBE\" and \"VIBE VixeN\" magazines.\n\nHe currently owns an independent record label, Pound 4 Pound Records, also based in St. Petersburg. The label consists of a talent roster which covers genres of music from rock & roll to hip hop.\n\nWinky now has his own promotion company called Winky Promotions.\n\nWinky Wright married Sayquana Barney on August 1, 2009. Winky often participates in charity events, in which he also has his own charity event called Winky Wright Foundation which gives him the opportunity to give back to the community. He currently resides in St. Petersburg, Florida.\n\nWinky Wright linked up with marketing professionals DMC (https://yourdmc.com/) in mid-2016 to launch his career in the St Petersburg, Florida real estate market.\n\n\n"}

Piloting a spaceship, the player explores a realistic 1:1 scale open-world representation of the Milky Way galaxy, with the gameplay being open-ended. The game is the first in the series to attempt to feature massively multiplayer gameplay, with players' actions affecting the narrative story of the game's persistent universe, while also retaining single-player options. \"Elite Dangerous\" is the fourth game in the \"Elite\" video game series, one of the longest-running video game franchises. It is the sequel to \"\", released in 1995.\n\nHaving been unable to agree to a funding deal with a publisher for many years, the developer began its Kickstarter campaign in November 2012. Pre-release test versions of the game had been available to backers since December 2013, and the final game was released for Windows in December 2014, with the macOS version later released in May 2015. A \"preview\" version of the game for Xbox One was later released via the Xbox Game Preview Program in June 2015 during Microsoft's briefing at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2015, and was fully released in October 2015, while a PlayStation 4 version was released on 27 June 2017. \"Elite Dangerous\" additionally supports all PC virtual reality devices. By the end of April 2015, \"Elite Dangerous\" had sold over 500,000 copies, with Frontier Developments expected to generate £22 million from sales. As of 15 January 2019, cumulative sales of \"Elite Dangerous\" exceeded 4.3 million franchise units, composed of 3 million base game units and 1.3 million \"Horizons\" expansion units.\n\nUpon its release in 2014, \"Elite Dangerous\" began in year 3300 and has been in sync with UTC albeit 1286 years in the future. The game is set around 45 years after \"Frontier: First Encounters\". \"Elite Dangerous\" retains the basic premise of previous games – players start with a spaceship and a small amount of money in an open galaxy and role-play in various activities to acquire more money and merit. These activities include trading, mining, exploration, bounty-hunting, piracy and assassination.\n\nThe game is the first in the series to feature online multiplayer with access to a massively multiplayer persistent world called Open Play, as well as an online-only single player mode. Open Play gameplay is similar to \"Eve Online\" in that many actions that would be considered griefing in other multiplayer games are generally permitted, as long as there is a valid roleplaying reason (e.g. robbery, extortion and blocking off star systems). However, some actions, such as \"mob mentality\" persecution of players, exploiting mechanics of the game (such as quitting the game in the middle of a fight to avoid death), and swearing are not allowed, and could result in a ban from the main server.\n\nWithin the virtual galaxy, the player can explore some 400 billion star systems complete with planets and moons that rotate and orbit in real time, reflecting dynamic day-night cycles. Around 150,000 of the game's star systems are taken from real astronomical data, while a few partially fictional planetary systems, which were created in \"Frontier\" and \"First Encounters\" before a significant number of exoplanets were discovered, are carried over. For example, none of the gas giants of the Fomalhaut system correspond with the detected properties of Fomalhaut b. A handful of entirely fictional systems named in the original \"Elite\", and also featured in later games, are included (e.g. the original starting system Lave). The remainder are procedurally generated according to scientific models. Players can dock their ships at space stations and outposts located throughout the galaxy in star systems to trade goods, purchase new spacecrafts, re-arm their ship, effect repairs and do missions from Mission Boards. Players may also find lost cargo or encounter other ships while in flight by investigating Unidentified Signal Sources.\n\nThere are three major factions, the \"Empire of Achenar\", the \"Galactic Federation\", and the \"Alliance of Independent Systems\". Patch 1.3, which launched in June 2015, featured the \"Power Play\" addition which introduced competitive, galactical faction challenges. Players can ally themselves with an in-game faction and contribute to it by completing faction missions while also earning various rewards. The collective outcome of each faction's achievements determines faction powers, territorial control, and their proceeding objectives. Each faction has their own line of ships that are obtained by acquiring ranks within the respective faction, except Alliance ships which are not locked behind a ranking system. The Federation has four ships made by an in-game federal corporation called Core Dynamics. The Empire has four ships manufactured by Gutamaya, an Imperial corporation. The Alliance has three ships, none of which require rank, manufactured by Lakon Spaceways.\n\nThere are three archetypal player roles attached with individual rankings (also known as player status) separate from faction rankings: Combat, Exploration, and Trading. Players gain experience points and rank in these areas by completing activities that are divided among the three roles. For example, a bounty-hunter destroying pirates will gain Combat experience points and progress in Combat rank. On 15 March 2015, the first player who reached Triple Elite status (Elite rank in Combat, Elite rank in Exploration, and Elite rank in Trading), the highest status, won £10,000. A certain status or rank with a faction can grant access permits to a number of systems that require them. Benefits also include ship discount prices.\n\nStarting in 2012, \"Elite Dangerous\" was developed using Frontier Development's own in-house COBRA game development engine. Frontier had been working on the game as a skunk-works background activity for some time prior to its Kickstarter launch, with other projects being prioritised.\n\nOn 14 November 2014, one month before launch, David Braben announced the removal of the game's offline single player mode, the developers having decided that they could not deliver an acceptable offline-only experience based on the original design. The Windows version of the game was released on 16 December 2014.\n\nOn 4 March 2015, Microsoft announced at the Game Developers Conference that \"Elite Dangerous\" would be released on Xbox One and was later launched in early access as part of Microsoft's Game Preview program during E3 in 2015. On 2 April 2015, the game was made available on Steam with support for cross-buy between the Windows version and the Mac version, the latter being released in May 2015. Although there are no plans for a Linux version of the game, Braben stated in 2014 that \"There is no reason why COBRA cannot run on Linux, running through OpenGL.\" A version for PlayStation 4 was released on 27 June 2017. The support of the OS X Version ended with the update 3.3 on 12 December 2018\n\nBraben has said that Thargoids, the warlike, insectoid aliens from the original games, would make an appearance in some capacity. Mission objectives introduced in May 2015 about ancient specimens fueled speculation of the coming introduction of the Thargoid species. On 5 January 2017, the Thargoids were possibly encountered by a player. The ship encountered was alien in nature. Through an escalation of encounters, it was eventually revealed the encountered race was in fact Thargoids. While initially Thargoid encounters were non-violent, a number of space stations have since been attacked leading to missions based on investigating, researching, and gathering materials to increase weapon effectiveness against the Thargoids. \n\nOn 25 October 2016, an extinct alien race, the Guardians, were added, with players allowed to explore the ancient ruins they left behind in order to gather data and materials to unlock special Guardian modules and specialized Human–Guardian hybrid weapons with increased effectiveness against Thargoid ships. Thematically, the Guardians were discovered in the year 3302.\n\nAs of 4 April 2020, Fleet Carriers will be added to the game, allowing players to own essentially mobile space stations for private use, though they are limited to one per player, and are exorbitantly (though not too prohibitively) expensive. They will be released soon. \n\nAt the 2011 Game Developers Conference, following a presentation on the development of the original \"Elite\", Braben was asked in a Q&A session if \"Elite 4\" was still on the drawing board. He replied \"yes, it would be a tragedy for it not to be\". The project had difficulty in attracting sufficient funding, which Braben had attributed to the traditional publishing model, which he saw as being biased against games with no recent comparable predecessors.\n\nBraben had previously discussed crowdfunding as a possible solution in April 2012. Public fundraising commenced in November 2012 using the Kickstarter website, the campaign lasting 60 days, with the aim being to raise £1.25m and deliver a finished game by March 2014. Braben described the campaign as a way of \"test-marketing the concept to verify there is broader interest in such a game\", in addition to raising the funds.\n\nFollowing the end of the Kickstarter, further public funding was sought through the developer's UK website, via PayPal. By April 2014, £1.7m had been raised, and Braben had reacquired the legal rights to the \"Elite\" franchise. Although the game's original total development budget had been £8 million, by September 2014 this had, in Braben's words, \"grown by quite a lot\".\n\nA playable alpha version of the game was released to certain Kickstarter backers in December 2013. In May 2014, the game entered the first phase of its beta test, focusing primarily on testing the systems and servers with a greater number of players. A pre-release \"gamma\" build was released to backers three weeks before launch, to give them a head start on other players. On 2 April 2015, the beta Mac version went live, accessible to all backers.\n\nThe first \"season\" of expansions for \"Elite Dangerous\", named \"Horizons\", was announced on 5 August 2015 at Gamescom, entered beta on 30 November 2015 and was released on 15 December 2015 for PC, followed by a 3 June 2016 release for Xbox One. Frontier Developments currently has no plans to release the expansion for Mac OS X unless Apple provides support for compute shaders, which Frontier believes are required to render planet surfaces and other objects. \"Elite Dangerous: Horizons\" is a separately priced product. Original customers who also purchased \"Horizons\" received exclusive access to the Cobra Mk. IV ship.\n\n\"Horizons\" adds planetary landings, ground vehicles and bases, synthesis of consumables and temporary ship upgrades, ship-launched fighters, passenger missions, a character creator, and co-op multicrew support for larger ships. Planetary landings feature procedurally generated planets, initially supporting only worlds without an atmosphere. Players can choose to set down at planetary bases or at any point of their choosing and can deploy a new eight-wheeled ground vehicle called the SRV (\"Surface Reconnaissance Vehicle\"). This vehicle is equipped with weapons, a \"wave scanner\" for finding resources, shipwrecks etc., a datalink system for hacking into bases, and thrusters that can lift the vehicle up above the ground for short periods of time. Thrusters in the wheels can be used to affix it to the ground on low-gravity worlds. Materials found on planets can be combined to boost ship jump range, synthesize repair materials, or upgrade weapons.\n\n\"Horizons\" is billed as a season of five expansions, starting with planetary landings and then followed with a more comprehensive looting and crafting system released in May 2016, ship-launched fighters and passenger missions released in October 2016, and support for multiple players working cooperatively on the same ship planned for a future expansion within the first half of 2017 ahead of PlayStation 4 release and with a 5th expansion to follow after that. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th expansions were announced originally for spring, summer and autumn 2016 respectively. But the 5th expansion had no reference to \"winter\", was not time-scheduled and had no content description, only stating a cryptic \"soon\" reference. The ability to walk around and the types of worlds players can land on is expected to be expanded during upcoming seasons, with landing on planets with atmospheres or earthlike worlds not being part of the \"Horizons\" season, but due at a later stage.\nOn 24 February 2017, due to the new discovery in the Trappist-1 system, the 2.3 update would be delayed to put it in the game. The 2.3 update called The Commanders was released on 11 April 2017, five days earlier than originally said. It consists of a 'Commander Creator' (also known as the Holo-Me), Multicrew and various other features. The 2.4 update called \"The Return\", with an expanded storyline for the alien Thargoids, was released on 26 September 2017.\n\n\"Beyond\" is the official title for the series of updates (3.0 onwards) which followed \"Horizons\". It focused on improvements to the core gameplay along with improvements to the game's \"crime and punishment\" system, better trading data, new wing missions, new ships (including the Alliance Chieftain, Krait, and alien Thargoid scouts), more interaction with megaships and installations, a \"tech broker\" offering more advanced weapons, in-game Galnet audio, an overhaul of mining, new astronomical anomalies to discover, and improvements to planetary visuals and more detailed surface environments. An open beta for 3.0 was released on 25 January 2018, with official launch of \"Chapter One\" on 27 February 2018. Subsequent \"Chapters\" were released across each quarter of 2018 culminating in the release of \"Chapter Four\" on 11 December 2018 that brought night vision capabilities along with a completely redesigned exploration system, planetary probes, and a Full Spectrum Scanner (FSS) tool for scanning unexplored star systems.\n\nSimultaneously announced and launched on 16 February 2016, \"Elite Dangerous: Arena\" was a low-priced standalone version of the CQC (Closed Quarters Combat) arena mode from \"Elite Dangerous\" allowing newcomers and those who already have \"Elite Dangerous\" to compete against each other. The corresponding game mode in \"Elite Dangerous\" was also renamed from \"CQC\" to \"Arena\" on the same day.\n\nFrom 7 to 11 July 2016, the game was offered for free on Steam. On 10 February 2017 it was removed for sale on Steam but it remains available as a play mode from the main \"Elite Dangerous\" game.\n\n\"Elite Dangerous\" received an aggregated score of 80/100 on Metacritic based on 52 critics, indicating that the game received \"generally positive reviews\" from critics.\n\nChris Thursten of PC Gamer rated the game 86/100, considering it to be \"potentially a classic\", depending on Frontier's ability to build on the \"broad but somewhat shallow foundations\" of the released version. Thursten described the gameplay experience as \"exhilarating excitement, matched by nothing else this year, contrasted with moments of emptiness, frustration, and boredom\". Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer gave the game 8/10 and considered it to be \"probably the most immersive and compelling recreation of deep space ever seen in gaming\", while finding some of the gameplay repetitive. Andy Kelly of GamesRadar gave the game 4/5, calling it a \"compelling space sandbox\" and a \"welcome return\" of the \"Elite\" franchise, but felt that the game at launch was \"missing a lot of important features, especially when it comes to multiplayer\". Roger Hargreaves of the Metro gave it 7/10, describing the game as a \"solid start\" that had yet to fulfil its potential. Reviewing the game for IGN, Rob Zacny called it \"one of the most enthralling and evocative space combat and trade sim games I've ever played\" and \"also one of the most boring\", seeing the balance of \"brief, intense emotional peaks and long, shallow valleys of boredom\" as \"fundamental to Elite's identity\". Reviewing a later version of the game in April 2015, after playing the game since launch, Lee Hutchinson from Ars Technica described \"Dangerous\" as \"so damn good that it transcends its problems\". Joel Peterson of Destructoid gave the PlayStation 4 version of the game 9/10, calling it \"A hallmark of excellence. There may be flaws, but they are negligible and won't cause massive damage.\"\n\nThe announcement of the removal of the offline mode on 14 November 2014 was met by a number of complaints from customers, with some saying they had backed the game on the understanding that it would feature offline play and others that there had been no prior warning of removal during the whole of the preceding development period. Frontier offered refunds to customers who had pre-ordered the game without playing it, and said that those who had already played the game, in alpha or beta form, would not be eligible for refunds. Later, Braben, speaking for the company, announced that refunds would be judged on a \"case-by-case\" basis.\n\nThe game had sold around 1.7 million units by the end of May 2016. By the end of December 2016 over 2.1 million paid franchise units were sold of \"Elite Dangerous\". As of 15 January 2019, cumulative sales of \"Elite Dangerous\" exceeded 4.3 million franchise units, composed of 3 million base game units and 1.3 million \"Horizons\" expansion units.\n\n\"Elite Dangerous\" won \"Best of E3\" from \"The Escapist\" and games.cz in 2014. \"Elite Dangerous\" won the Game Developers Choice Award 2015 for best audience. It was ranked as the Best VR Game of 2016 from Game Revolution. It was nominated for Evolving Game by the British Academy Games Awards (BAFTA) in 2017. The game was also nominated for the \"Still Playing\" award at the 2019 Golden Joystick Awards. \"Elite Dangerous: Beyond\" was nominated for \"Evolving Game\" at the 2019 British Academy Games Awards.\n"}

When this did not happen the tank was deemed unnecessary and the project terminated. A development of the TOG I design, only a single prototype was built before the project was dropped.\n\nThe second design to come out of the Special Vehicle Development Committee (nicknamed \"The Old Gang\" as it was made up of people who had worked on the original British tanks of the First World War) the TOG 2 was similar to the TOG 1 and kept many of its features. Instead of the track path arrangement of the TOG 1 which - like that of the First World War British tanks - ran up over the top of the hull and back down, the track path was lower on the return run and the doors were above the tracks. Ordered in 1940, built by Foster's of Lincoln, the prototype ran for the first time in March 1941.\n\nThe design included a 6-pounder gun and side sponsons. For \"initial trials\" it was fitted with a mockup turret with a dummy gun and later with a simplified turret mounting a QF 3-inch 16 cwt anti-tank gun, in 1942 it was given a turret that was under development for the Cruiser Mk VIII Challenger tank design with the QF 17-pounder (76.2 mm) gun. The turret \"in modified form\" was used on the Challenger. The planned sponsons were never fitted.\n\nAlthough equipped with the same electro-mechanical drive as originally fitted to the TOG 1, the TOG 2 used twin generators and no problems were reported. It was modified to include, among other things, a change from the unsprung tracks to a torsion bar suspension and went through successful trials in May 1943. No further development occurred, although a revised version, the TOG 2 (R) was proposed. The 'R' would have been shorter, used torsion bar suspension and had no sponsons.\n\nThe single TOG 2 prototype can be seen at The Tank Museum.\n\nThe TOG2 has made appearances in the online game World of Tanks.\n\n\n\n"}

He is considered to be one of the film industry's most accomplished stunt drivers. In a lengthy career spanning 61 years, his body of work included classic films such as \"Thunder Road\", \"Bullitt\", \"Vanishing Point, Duel,\" and \"The French Connection\". He was inducted into the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 2001.\n\nLoftin was born in Blountstown, Florida and grew up in Alabama and Mississippi where, he learned to ride a motorcycle when he was 10 years-old. He attended high school in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, and began his stunt career at the age of 19 as a member of a traveling motorcycle stunt show in the early 1930s. Having to constantly repair and maintain motorcycles made him a proficient mechanic. After serving in the United States Marine Corps, Loftin moved to Los Angeles, California in the late 1930s where he worked as a mechanic.\n\nHe began his career as a stuntman in the 1930s, working in serials such as \"Dick Tracy Returns\" and \"The Green Hornet\". During the 1940s and 1950s, Loftin raced in many Southern California off-road motorcycle events such as the Catalina Grand Prix, the Big Bear Hare & Hound desert race, the Greenhorn Enduro and others. Loftin was soon being hired by film studios for his talent as a motorcycle stunt rider but, also became invaluable for his mechanical expertise on film sets. Although Loftin performed many different types of stunt work, it is his driving abilities for which he is most remembered. His stunt driving in the 1958 film \"Thunder Road\" was considered groundbreaking for its realism. He had an uncredited stunt driver role in the seminal 1966 auto racing film, \"Grand Prix\".\n\nLoftin served as the uncredited stunt coordinator for the 1968 film \"Bullitt\", which included one of the most influential car chase scenes in film history. He was also one of the stuntmen driving the green Ford Mustang during the chase scene filmed on the streets of San Francisco. While working on \"Bullitt\", one of his fellow stuntmen called him \"the greatest car man in the business\". Loftin was also involved in the filming of the car chase scene in the 1971 film \"The French Connection\", which is also considered one of the most impressive car chases in film history. Loftin mentioned that the hardest stunt to do during his whole career was during the final scene in \"White Line Fever\" (1975) driving the main character truck, for which he was the only hired stuntman. This later got him more iconic stuntman roles for the main characters trucks in \"The Great Smokey Roadblock\" (1977), \"Smokey and the Bandit\" (1977), \"Steel Cowboy\" (1978), \"High Ballin\"' (1978), \"Smokey and the Bandit II\" (1980) and in \"Over The Top\" (1987).\n\nAside from being a busy stuntman, Loftin also acted in bit parts of the many films and television shows in which he performed stunts. One of his most famous, yet discreet roles was as the murderous truck driver in Steven Spielberg's \"Duel\" (billed as Cary Loftin), in which only his arm and boots can be seen. He also acted as a truck driver in \"Stroker Ace\" (1983) in which his face is never seen as in \"Duel\", but not as a villain this time.\n\nHe did, however, act as a kind of villainous car driver in \"Christine\" (1983) and similarly, as a faceless truck driver in \"Maximum Overdrive\" (1986), both in which films the machinery comes to life as evil. He did a little acting, all the stunt work and some driving scenes in \"Christine\", where he drove the main character car and also as the guy driving the white Dodge truck with the red stripe that drops off one of the characters on a road. He also did much of the stunt work and driving scenes in \"Maximum Overdrive\", being sole driver of the red trash truck marked \"Zeke's Trash Removal\" and one of two stunt drivers, along with Tommy J. Huff, of the lead character Green Goblin truck. Loftin acted as another murderous faceless truck driver in \"Messenger of Death\" (1988) again with Tommy J. Huff and had a supporting role as Skinner in the Keenan Wynn and Bob Mathias series \"The Troubleshooters\", which aired on NBC in the 1959–1960 season.\n\nA notable demonstration of stunt driving that Loftin performed was the car chase/race in \"Against All Odds\" (1984). He was the driver of the black 1982 Ferrari 308 GTB. According to the movie's director, Taylor Hackford, Loftin was 68 when he did this stunt. At first Hackford was reluctant to hire the aging stuntman, but stunt coordinator Gary Davis convinced Hackford that, even at his age, Loftin was by far the best car man in the business at that time.\n\nLoftin eventually semi-retired in 1991 at age 77 after doing \"Pink Lightning\" (1991), although he still took minor stunt roles as a truck driver. He did stunt driving for the main characters' trucks in \"B.J. and the Bear\" (1978–81) and \"Movin' On\" (1974-76). His last major role was in \"Black Dog\" (1998) for the main characters truck he did the stunt driving for. Loftin died after the movie was filmed and before the movie premiered. \nLoftin died of natural causes on March 4, 1997 in Huntington Beach, California, aged 83. He is a member of the Stuntmen's Hall of Fame, and the Motorcycle Hall of Fame.\n\n"}

His father, Charles Daniélou, was an anticlerical Breton politician who held numerous national ministerial posts in the Third Republic. One of his brothers was Roman Catholic prelate and Académie française member, Jean Daniélou.\n\nHe received his education at the , Neuilly-sur-Seine, and at St. John's College, Annapolis. The young Daniélou studied singing under the famous Charles Panzéra, as well as classical dancing with Nicholas Legat (teacher of Vaslav Nijinsky), and composition with Max d'Ollone. Subsequently, he performed professionally on stage with dancers like and Marjorie Daw. Growing up he rebelled against his mother's deep devotion to her faith, but his father remained a positive influence, which helped in developing his musical talent and in coping with his homosexuality. He studied piano and singing, learning the songs of Duparc and Chausson and the Lieder of Schumann and Schubert. He started writing poems, as acquired proficiency in English and other European languages.\n\nHe and his partner, Swiss photographer , first went to India as part of an adventure trip, and they were fascinated with the art and culture of the nation. Daniélou and Burnier were among the first Westerners to visit India's famed erotic temples in the village of Khajuraho and Burnier's stunning photographs of the ancient temple complex launched the site internationally. The photographs were featured in an exhibition at the New York's Metropolitan Museum.\n\nIn 1932, during his first trip to India, he met one of the great influences poet Rabindranath Tagore. His close association with Rabindranath Tagore lead to him being the director of Tagore's school of music at Shantiniketan (Visva-Bharati University). Subsequently, in 1935, he joined the Banaras Hindu University, where he studied Hindu music, Sanskrit, Indian philosophy and Hindu religion for the next 15 years. In 1949, he was appointed as a research professor at the University, a post he held until 1953. he also remained the director of the College of Indian Music. In Banaras (now Varanasi), he lived a mansion on the banks of the Ganga, named Rewa Kothi. During these years, he studied Indian classical music in Varanasi with Shivendranath Basu and played the veena, which he started playing professionally. He also studied Hindi, Sanskrit languages as well as Indian philosophy. His interest in the symbolism of Hindu architecture and sculpture, lead to long trips with Burnier to Khajuraho, Bhubaneswar and Konarak, sites in central India and Rajasthan. He also translated some works of Swami Karpatri by whom he was initiated into Shaivism under the name Shiva Sharan (Protected by Shiva).\n\nIn 1953, he joined the Adyar Library and Research Centre at the Theosophical Society Adyar near Madras (now Chennai), where he was the director of a centre of research into Sanskrit literature until 1956. In 1959, he became a member of French Institute of Pondicherry, which works in the field of Indology.\n\nUpon his return to Europe in 1960, he was appointed an adviser to UNESCO's International Music Council, which led to a number of recordings of traditional music such as \"\", \"Musical Atlas\", \"Musical Sources\" and \"Anthology of Indian Classical Music - A Tribute to Alain Daniélou\". In 1966, he became the founder and director of the \"International Institute for Comparative Music Studies and Documentation\" in West Berlin, where he remained till 1977; he also remained the director of the \"Istituto Internazionale di Musica Comparata\" in Venice from 1969 to 82.\n\nHe worked on classical Indian music. But his more important contribution to Indology is his writings on the ancient wisdom of the Veda, Hindu philosophy, and Shaivism.\n\nHe is the author of over thirty books on Indian music and culture. He received several awards for his work on music. He was also a photographer and artist.\n\nHe was an Officer of the Légion d'Honneur, an Officer of the Ordre National du Mérite, and Commander of Arts and Letters.

He worked for Nick Gulas's Nashville territory, where he paired up with Eric Embry as the \"brother\" tag team of Bobby and Don Fulton.\n\nHe then moved on to Stu Hart's Calgary territory working with the likes of Bret Hart, The Dynamite Kid, The Cuban Assassin, Bobby Bass, Ross Hart, Bruce Hart, Giant Haystacks and Davey Boy Smith. Then it was on to the short-lived Knoxville territory forming a tag team with Terry Taylor called \"The Fantastic Ones\". After the territory closed, Hines and Taylor split up.\n\nHe then moved on to the Jerry Jarrett's Continental Wrestling Association territory where he worked preliminary matches. He then went to Southwest Championship Wrestling in San Antonio, Texas for Joe Blanchard, battling Adrian Street and Eric Embry in a series of scaffold matches. His new tag team partner Tommy Rogers started for Bill Watts' Mid-South Wrestling. There the Fantastics (Fulton and Rogers) formed and feuded with the Midnight Express.\n\nIn 1984, the team continued their feud with The Midnight Express in World Class Championship Wrestling that later extended into Jim Crockett Promotions.\n\nIn 1986, they had a feud with The Sheepherders (who would become the \"Bushwhackers\"), Butch Miller and Luke Williams in the Universal Wrestling Federation.\n\nIn 1987, back in WCCW, they feuded with the Rock 'n' Roll RPMs (Mike Davis and Tommy Lane). They won the feud by winning a scaffold match at the \"Parade of Champions\" on May 3, 1987. The Fantastics also made an appearance at the World Wrestling Council in Puerto Rico.\n\nThey next went to the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions to continue their feud with The Midnight Express and to win the NWA United States Tag Team Titles on two occasions. They also defeated The Sheepherders to win the vacant NWA Mid-America Tag Team Championship. In 1989, they left and have been wrestling, sometimes together, sometimes not, in the independent circuit around the United States, and in All Japan Pro Wrestling.\n\nIn 1990, he started his own territory in Ohio called James Hines presents Big Time Wrestling (which was a precursor to Smoky Mountain Wrestling). The federation was based primarily in Circleville, Ohio. Hines brought in talent like Hacksaw Jim Duggan, Ronnie Garvin, Abdullah the Butcher, Cactus Jack, Wahoo McDaniel, Jake Roberts, and many more to participate in regular cards held in Circleville at the Pickaway County Fairgrounds Coliseum. Hines was the Big Time Wrestling champion several times, and also often teamed with his brother, Jackie Fulton, as the Fantastics, on these cards. These cards inspired wrestlers like Shark Boy and many others to become pro wrestlers. Fulton and Ivan Koloff ran a wrestling school in North Carolina in the early 1990s. The Fantastics (Bobby and Jackie Fulton) then made regular appearances in All Japan and in Smoky Mountain Wrestling.\n\nThe Fantastics made a brief appearance in the WWF in June 1997 when Fulton wrestled Rogers in what was billed as a Light Heavyweight Match. According to Fulton, they were brought in at the request of Jim Cornette to convince Vince McMahon to start a light heavyweight division, which eventually started.\n\nIn October 2015, Fulton announced he will undergo a retirement tour called the \"Fantastic Finale\", which ended in 2017.\n\nOn June 10, 2017, Fulton teamed up with \"Big Time\" Josh Lewis to win the NWA Mid-America Tag Team Championships from The East and West Express in NWA Supreme. The East and West Express regained the championship on June 23, 2017.\n\nIn March 2016, Hines started promoting events again under the banner World Classic Professional Big Time Wrestling, in which he had an ongoing rivalry with ECW original Shane Douglas. Some of the stars who have appeared in WCPBTW include Sting, Tito Santana, Ricky Morton, Ronnie Garvin, Cowboy Bob Orton, Tony Atlas, Kevin Sullivan, J.J. Dillon, Jimmy Valiant, The Sandman, Sabu, The Barbarian, Buff Bagwell, Bobby Eaton, The Honky Tonk Man, Bushwhacker Luke, Bill Dundee, Tracy Smothers, and Tommy Rich.\n\nFulton wrestled his final match on May 26, 2018 for his WCPBTW promotion. What originally began as a singles match against Nick \"Kid\" Curry, the son of Fred Curry, turned into a tag team match that saw Fulton and Nick Curry team up to defeat Gary Wolfe and Robby Starr. Following the match, Hines took off his wrestling boots and left them in the ring, signifying his retirement as a professional wrestler. He is scheduled to reunite with his brother Jackie on April 12, 2019 at NCWA's Chair City Clash in Thomasville NC in tag team action against George South and Dangerous E.\n\nHines became a born-again Christian and also has been preaching the Christian gospel since October 2003. He has two sons, Dillon (The Good Doctor/War Eagle) and Jarron. He was diagnosed with throat cancer in December 2019, and began chemotherapy the next month.\n\n"}

Unveiled at the Brussels Motor Show that year, the 212 was an evolution of the 166 — a sports car for the road that could also win international races. In 1951, two 212 Inters, both Vignale coupés, driven by Taruffi/Chinetti and Ascari/Villoresi, scored 1–2 victory at Carrera Panamericana in Mexico.\n\nThe chassis was similar to the 125 with a suspension featuring double wishbones in front and live axle in back. Coachbuilders included Carrozzeria Touring, Ghia, Ghia-Aigle, Vignale, Stabilimenti Farina, and now Pinin Farina. The latter was an important move for the company, as Farina was already well-known and adding his styling skills would be a tremendous boost for Maranello. However, Pinin Farina was as prideful as Enzo Ferrari, and neither would go to the other to request business up to this point. A mutual meeting halfway between Maranello and Turin was the negotiated solution. First Ferrari to be bodied by Pinin Farina was 212 Inter Cabriolet, chassis no. 0177E.\n\nThe \"Inter's\" wheelbase was 4\" longer than the \"Export's\". The cars shared a larger, bored-out (68 mm) 2.6 L (2563 cc/156 in³) version of Ferrari's \"Colombo\" V12 engine. Output was for the single Weber 36DCF carburetor \"Inter\", for the triple Weber \"Export\". Improved cylinder heads raised power in 1952.\n\nThe British magazine Autocar got hold of what they described as the first production model Ferrari 212 in 1950, which outperformed any car that they had previously tested. It recorded a top speed of over and acceleration times of 0 to 60 mph (96 km/h) of 10.5 seconds and 100 mph (161 km/h) in 22.5 seconds; the magazine however noted they had limited the engine to 6,500 rpm out of respect for the newness and low mileage of the car they were using, which suggested that even better performance would be available from a fully \"run in\" model. The test appears also to have been the Autocar team's first encounter with a five speed gear box.\n\nA single 212 Inter, chassis no. 0223EU, was fitted with the available 225 S or 2.7 L Colombo V12 engine, combined with a long wheelbase \"Europa\" type chassis, creating a unique model that would be properly referred to as a 225 Inter or 225 Europa. This 1952 one-off model was given a Giovanni Michelotti-penned coupé body built by Vignale.\n\nAnother 212 Inter, chassis number 0253EU, also received the 2.7 liter three-carburetor V12, and was bodied as the last Barchetta by Carrozzeria Touring in their Superleggera construction method. It was acquired by Ford Motor Company for Henry Ford II for study in the research leading to the development of Ford's competitor to the Corvette, the Thunderbird. The car is currently in the collection of the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles, CA.\n"}

Bezzerides\n\nAlbert Isaac Bezzerides ( August 9, 1908 – January 1, 2007) was an American novelist and screenwriter, best known for writing films noir and action motion pictures, especially several of Warners' \"social conscience\" films of the 1940s.\n\nBezzerides was born in Samsun, Ottoman Turkey, to a Greek-Armenian family who emigrated to America before he was two years old.\n\nBezzerides had begun writing short stories as a student at the University of California, Berkeley, where he studied electrical engineering. He was first published in a 1935 issue of \"Story Magazine\", which printed his story, \"Passage Into Eternity.\"\n\nBezzerides wrote the novel \"The Long Haul\" (1938), which got him into the screenwriting business. He wrote such action feature movies as \"They Drive by Night\" (1940; based on \"The Long Haul\"), \"Desert Fury\" (1947), \"Thieves' Highway\" (1949), \"On Dangerous Ground\" (1952), \"Beneath the 12 Mile Reef\" (1953) and \"Track of the Cat\" (1954). He was one of the co-creators of the Western television series \"The Big Valley\".\n\nIn 1940, Warner Bros. offered Bezzerides $2,000 for movie rights to \"The Long Haul\". He learned later that the script based on his book had already been written. The resulting film, \"They Drive By Night\", starred Humphrey Bogart and George Raft. Bezzerides' third novel, \"Thieves' Market\" (1949), was adapted as a film titled \"Thieves' Highway\", directed by Jules Dassin.\n\nThe studio also offered Bezzerides a contract to be a screenwriter at a salary of $300 a week. At the time, he was working as a communications engineer for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. He later commented, \"I had no idea whether it was guilt or conscience, or greed to swindle more stories out of me, that motivated Warner Bros. to offer me a seven-year contract ... Whatever their reason, I grabbed their offer so I could quit my putrid career as a communications engineer by becoming a writer, writing scripts in an entirely new world.\"\n\nHis first film credit was 1942's \"Juke Girl\", which starred Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan.\n\nBezzerides' script for \"Kiss Me Deadly\" (1955) transformed the novel by Mickey Spillane into an apocalyptic, atomic-age paranoia film noir. When asked about his script, and his decision to make \"the great whatsit\" the Pandora's Box objective of a ruthless cast of characters, Bezzerides commented: \"People ask me about the hidden meanings in the script, about the A-bomb, about McCarthyism, what does the poetry mean, and so on. And I can only say that I didn't think about it when I wrote it . . . I was having fun with it. I wanted to make every scene, every character, interesting. A girl comes up to Ralph Meeker, I make her a nympho. She grabs him and kisses him the first time she sees him. She says, \"You don't taste like anybody I know.\" I'm a big car nut, so I put in all that stuff with the cars and the mechanic. I was an engineer, and I gave the detective the first phone answering machine in that picture. I was having fun.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1896034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896034", "title": "Hitopadesha", "text": "Hitopadesha\n\nHitopadesha (Sanskrit: हितोपदेशः, IAST: \"Hitopadeśa\", \"Beneficial Advice\") is an Indian text in the Sanskrit language consisting of fables with both animal and human characters. It incorporates maxims, worldly wisdom and advice on political affairs in simple, elegant language, and the work has been widely translated\n\nLittle is known about its origin. The surviving text is believed to be from the 12th-century, but was probably composed by Narayana between 800 and 950 CE. The oldest manuscript found in Nepal has been dated to the 14th century, and its content and style has been traced to the ancient Sanskrit treatises called the \"Panchatantra\" from much earlier.\n\nThe authorship of the \"Hitopadesa\" has been contested. 19th-century Indologists attributed the text to Vishnu Sharma, a narrator and character that often appears in its fables. Upon the discovery of the oldest known manuscript of the text in Nepal, dated to 1373, and the preparation of a critical edition, scholars generally accept the authority of its two concluding verses. These verses mention Narayana as the author and a king called Dhavala Chandra as the patron of the text. But as no other work by this author is known, and since the ruler mentioned has not been traced in other sources, we know almost nothing of either of them. Dating the work is therefore problematic. There are quotations within it from 8th century works and other internal evidence may point to an East Indian origin during the later Pala Empire (8th-12th century).\n\nNarayana says that the purpose of creating the work is to encourage proficiency in Sanskrit expression (\"samskrita-uktishu\") and knowledge of wise behaviour (\"niti-vidyam\"). This is done through the telling of moral stories in which birds, beasts and humans interact. Interest is maintained through the device of enclosed narratives in which a story is interrupted by an illustrative tale before resuming. The style is elaborate and there are frequent pithy verse interludes to illustrate the points made by the various speakers. On account of these, which provide by far the greater part of the text, the work has been described as an anthology of (sometimes contradictory) verses from widespread sources relating to statecraft.\n\nThe \"Hitopadesha\" is quite similar to the ancient Sanskrit classic, the \"Panchatantra\", another collection of fables with morals. Both have an identical frame story, although the \"Hitopadesha\" differs by having only four divisions to the ancient text's five. According to Ludwik Sternbach's critical edition of the text, the \"Panchatantra\" is the primary source of some 75% of the \"Hitopadesha\"'s content, while a third of its verses can be traced to the \"Panchatantra\". In his own introductory verses, Narayana acknowledges that he is indebted to the \"Panchatantra\" and 'another work'. The latter is unknown but may possibly be the Dharmasastras or some other.\n\nThe \"Hitopadesha\" is organized into four books, with a preface section called \"Prastavika\". The opening verse expresses reverence to the Hindu god Ganesha and goddess Saraswati. There are several versions of the text available, though the versions are quite similar unlike other ancient and medieval era Hindu texts wherein the versions vary significantly. The shortest version has 655 verses, while the longest has 749 verses. In the version translated by Wilkins, the first book of \"Hitopadesha\" has nine fables, the second and third each have ten, while the fourth has thirteen fables.\n\nThe Book 1 is introduced with the statement that wise and sincere friends may be poor or destitute, but it is they who may help one achieve successes in life. The book recommends that the good find good friends, they are like a vessel in which one deposits both joys and sorrows of life, and it is not words that define a friend but their behavior and actions.\n\nThe Book 2 is introduced with the statement that great friendships can be destroyed by the cruel and envious beings who envy such friendship. The book states that misinformation creates wedge between friends, as does a focus on disagreements, rash action without due investigation and a lack of communication.\nThe third book presents a series of fables wherein war is described as a consequence of greed, criticism of others, wicked people and their ideologies, cruel and ungrateful leader, lack of restraint, lack of preparation, poor fortifications, weak military, weak diplomacy, and poor counsel.\nThe fables in Book 4 state that it is always better to seek peace with seven types of people: the truthful, the virtuous, the just, the strong, the victorious, those with many brothers, and the self-destructing worthless. Peace can be achieved, states \"Hitopadesha\", if one examines one's own behavior and one's own seeking as much as that of the opponent, pays attention to the counsel of one's good friends, treats the opponent with respect and understanding that is in tune with the opponent's character, forms one or more of sixteen types of treaties, reciprocal assistance and cooperative ventures between the two sides thereby enabling the pursuit of truth.\n\nThe text ends with the following,\n\nBy the early 20th-century, translations of the \"Hitopadesha\" into the following Indian languages were known:\n\nThe text has also been widely translated under different titles into Asian languages such as Burmese, Khmer, Thai, Malay, Persian, Sinhala, as well as into Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Spanish and Russian.\n\nThe Emperor Akbar (1542–1605) commended the work of translating the \"Hitopadesha\" to his own minister, Abul Fazl, with the suggestion that the poems which often interrupt the narrative should be abridged. Fazl accordingly put the book into a familiar style and published it with explanations under the title of the \"Criterion of Wisdom\".\n\nThe \"Hitopadesha\" was also a favourite among the scholars of the British Raj. It was the first Sanskrit book to be printed in the Nagari script, when it was published by William Carey in Serampore in 1803–4, with an introduction by Henry Colebrooke. This was followed by several later editions during the 19th century, including Max Müller's of 1884, which contains an interlinear literal translation.\n\nMuch earlier, Sir William Jones encountered the work in 1786 and it was translated into English the following year by Charles Wilkins, who had also made the earliest English translation of the Bhagavad Gita. A later translation by Edwin Arnold, then Principal of Puna College, was published in London in 1861 under the title \"The Book of Good Counsels\".\n\n\n"}

Hardy III (born January 7, 1923) is an entrepreneur and the founder and CEO of 84 Lumber Company and Nemacolin Woodlands Resort.\n\nDuring the 1970s, 84 Lumber’s business grew and opened 229 stores. In 1984, the company undertook an expansion plan to open at least 30 new stores. Along with grand openings, stores were remodeled and renovated from no-frills lumber yards to new and improved building materials stores. In 1987, as the improvement plan generated success, the business opened their strict policy of cash-and-carry to options of using credit.\n\nJoseph Hardy's son, Joe Jr. worked his way up through the ranks and became Chief Operating Officer at 84 Lumber, however he was passed over as successor of the company when he attracted multiple sclerosis. He would get tired easily and have to go home at a reasonable time to sleep, Joseph Hardy viewed this as a flaw and fired his son.\n\nIn 1992, after 34 years of running the company, Joe Hardy handed the daily responsibility of 84 Lumber to his daughter, Maggie Hardy Magerko, who had served as Executive Vice President. The company continued to expand, opening its 400th store in 1997. \n\nWith Hardy Magerko as leader, 84 Lumber began targeting construction customers and thus added a professional sales force, consisting of 450 new sales representatives, to the team. While this proved to be successful, the company was still facing stiff competition from big-box retail stores and saw the need to expand into the growing do-it-yourselfers crowd.\n\nThe company opened its first retail store, 84 Plus, in 1999. In an effort to appease the retail and professional customers, 84 Plus stores featured two separate sections dividing 12,000 supplies; one section was designated for contractors while the other section was designated for do-it-yourselfers. Over a hundred 84 Plus stores opened in the United States. \n\nThe early 2000s proved to be successful for 84 Lumber. In 2002, the company hit record sales and in 2004, they opened 18 new stores.\n\nIn 2008, however, 84 Lumber’s profits plummeted when the housing market crashed and brought the building supplies market down with it. Vast spending and impulsive decisions contributed to a tough financial situation as well, placing 84 Lumber on the brink of bankruptcy in 2009.\n\nThe situation for the company improved some years after the crash, as the market started to bounce back. With a restructuring of the workforce and the selling of company real estate, Hardy Magerko was able to turn the company around and increase sales 27 percent from 2012 to 2013.\n\nBecause of his successful management of the company and his guidance to his daughter, Maggie, 84 Lumber is now the leading privately held building materials supplier to professional contractors and build-it-yourselfers in the United States.\n\nHardy announced on Sunday, September 9, 2007 at a tailgate party at Nemacolin Woodlands Resort that he was backing out of the 2007 general election for Fayette County commissioner, and thus ended his political career. Hardy finished first in vote getting in the 2007 primary for Fayette County commissioner.\n\nHardy and his first wife (for 50 years), Dorothy, had five children, the youngest of whom, Maggie, is now president of 84 Lumber. With his second wife, Debra, he has two daughters, Taylor, and Paige. Eighty-four-year-old Hardy married Kristin Georgi, a 22-year-old salon employee at Nemacoln Woodlands Resort. Having agreed to a pre-nuptial and wedding contract, the wedding took place on Saturday, May 5, 2007 in Las Vegas, Nevada. On Monday, Aug. 20, 2007, Hardy filed for divorce, with the petition citing irreconcilable differences.\nHardys fourth wife was 51-year old Rebecca Davis, whom he married in December 2009.\nOn November 21, 2014, Hardy married Jodi Santella Williams. They have one son together, named JJ Alexander Hardy.\nHardy has served on the Washington & Jefferson College Board of Trustees.\n\nHardy has recently been quoted saying, \"I want to die broke. For the remainder of my life, I want to enjoy and participate in the giving of money to help improve people's lives.\"\n\n"}

The primary features of these translations are the use of the language of ordinary people and the inclusion of extensive commentaries aimed at helping its readers to understand the meaning of the biblical texts. \n\nThe Christian Community Bible began to be produced in 1986 when Rev. Alberto Rossa, a Claretian missionary in the Philippines, saw the need for an English version. With the help of the French priest Bernard Hurault, the translation was finished in 18 months. The work was published in 1988. The editors of the Christian Community Bible consider it to be a very accurate translation from the Hebrew and Greek biblical texts. New editions are currently coordinated by the Pastoral Bible Foundation and are currently published by Claretian Publications (also known as Claretian Communications).\n\nThe editors of the Christian Community Bible have slightly reorganized the books of the bible with respect to the usual Catholic canon. While the New Testament books are found in the same order as they are found in other bibles, this is not the case for the Old Testament (the Hebrew Bible and the deuterocanonical books). According to the introduction to the seventeenth edition: \"Here we kept, in broad outlines, the distribution of the books according to the three categories present in the Jewish or Hebrew bible\". The result is that the Christian Community Bible's order is a blend of the Jewish and Catholic order (here represented by the Douay-Rheims Bible). The King James Version is also listed for comparison purposes:\n\nThere are versions of the Christian Community Bible in 10 languages: Indonesian, Chinese (\"mùlíng shèngjīng\"), Cebuano (\"Biblia sa Kristohanong Katilingban\"), chavacano, French (\"Bible des Peuples\"), Ilonggo (\"Biblia Sang Katilingban Sang Mga Kristiano\"), Korean, Quechuan, Spanish (\"Biblia Latinoamericana\") and Tagalog (\"Biblia ng Sambayanang Pilipino\").\n\nThe \"Pastoral Bible\" was published in 1999 in traditional Chinese (subsequently also available in simplified Chinese). Since its publication, this translation has been in the centre of a controversy regarding the translation process and the content of its commentaries. Because of the criticisms, some regard this translation as being a poor translation unsuitable for lay people without extensive prior theological training; at the same time, despite these criticisms, there are also people who recommend this translation to lay people.\n\nThe \"Bible des Peuples\" (literally \"Bible of the \") is a version translated by Bernard and Louis Hurault and published in 1998. The version is still considered controversial by some in the Jewish community because of replacement theology overtones in its notes.\n\nA previous version in French language, called \"Bible des Communautés chrétiennes\" (literally \"Bible of the Christian Communities\"), was translated by Bernard and Louis Hurault and published in 1994. Its imprimatur was rescinded in 1995 amid accusations of having anti-semitic overtones in its commentaries.\nThe \"Biblia Latinoamérica\" (literally \"Latin America Bible\") was begun in 1960 by Rev. Bernard Hurault in Chile and published in 1972. Hurault decided that a Bible that can be understood by ordinary poor people is needed, and that this Bible should include commentaries to help its readers understand it. He began translating from Hebrew and Greek to Spanish, incorporating his own homilies and questions from his own congregation as commentaries. The version received mixed reviews because its notes and introductions support teachings of the Liberation theology.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1896057", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896057", "title": "Long May You Run", "text": "Long May You Run\n\nLong May You Run is a studio album credited to the Stills-Young Band, a collaboration between Stephen Stills and Neil Young, released in 1976 on Reprise Records, catalogue MS 2253. It peaked at #26 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and certified gold in the U.S. by the RIAA. The album is the sole studio release by Stills and Young in tandem. Musically, it follows mostly in a similar vein to the duo's other joint work with Buffalo Springfield and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, traversing various facets of Americana and folk music, while songs such as \"Make Love to You\" have something of a jazz feel, and the extensive use of synthesised strings on the second side give the songs an art rock sound.\n\nFollowing the Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young stadium tour of 1974, an attempt by the quartet to finalize a new album ended amidst acrimony without result. David Crosby and Graham Nash resumed their partnership as Crosby & Nash, while Stills and Young continued their independent careers. Songs from the aborted CSNY album appeared on various albums by group members, and Stills covered two Young songs on his contemporary studio albums: \"New Mama\" on \"Stills\" and \"The Loner\" on \"Illegal Stills\".\n\nIn early 1976, Stills and Young reached a rapprochement, and began to work on a joint album project from a desire by both to pick up where they left off with their Buffalo Springfield-era guitar explorations, a decade after the inception of the band. Crosby and Nash signed on as well, and briefly \"Long May You Run\" looked to be the awaited CSNY reunion album. However, on a deadline Nash and Crosby left Miami to finish the sessions for what would become their 1976 album \"Whistling Down the Wire\", and Young and Stills reacted by removing the duo's vocals and other contributions from the master tapes. Crosby and Nash vowed never to work with either again, although less than a year later they would regroup with Stills for a new CSN album in 1977.\n\nThe Stills-Young Band, comprising Stills' then-current touring band behind the pair, began a tour in 1976 prior to the album's release. The tour commenced in Clarkston, Michigan on June 23, but after nineteen dates Young dropped out after July 20 via a telegram to Stills, forcing Stills to complete the concert tour solo through October. The telegram read: \"Dear Stephen, funny how some things that start spontaneously end that way. Eat a peach. Neil.\" Young would later cite cryptic personal reasons for his departure, namely that he had \"voice issues\" but he has since stated the tour \"wasn't working\" and that the \"balance was off in some way\" as it progressed. As the tour progressed it was progressively getting better with Young even stating that it was \"the resurgence of Stephen Stills\" and telling Stephen after one of the best shows, to not think of it as a peak but as the new level to play every night at. However, during the tour the critics were writing harsh reviews of Stills while praising Young, titled \"Young Hot, Stills Not\", Stills drinking heavily started to take it out on the tour personnel thinking they were purposefully making him bad. However, even after Young told Stills not to read the reviews, he wouldn't accept the help so Young left.\nThe album's advance single, \"Long May You Run\", peaked at #71 on the UK singles chart. The song was an elegy for Neil Young's first car (which he nicknamed \"Mort\"), a 1948 Buick Roadmaster hearse that died in 1962 when its transmission blew in Blind River, Ontario. Mort was a different vehicle from the 1953 Pontiac hearse, nicknamed Mort 2, that Richie Furay, traveling with Stills, saw Young driving in a Hollywood traffic jam in 1966 that led to the formation of Buffalo Springfield. On January 22, 2010, Young performed it on the final episode of \"The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien\". A few weeks later, Young performed the song during the closing ceremony of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, accompanying the extinguishment of the Olympic cauldron.\n\n\nAdditional musicians\n\nTechnical personnel\n\nThank you: Guillermo Giachetto, Jenny Cadley, Idapei,The Evening Coconut, and Brad Richardson who fixed everything in the middle of the night\n\nThe Stills-Young Band tour lasted until July 20 1976, when Neil Young pulled out. Stephen Stills carried on for three more dates through July 23–25, when the rest of the tour was cancelled.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1896068", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896068", "title": "Frontier: First Encounters", "text": "Frontier: First Encounters\n\nFrontier: First Encounters is a space trading and combat simulator video game developed by Frontier Developments and published by GameTek in 1995 for DOS. The player pilots a spaceship through a universe pursuing trading, combat and other missions. \n\n\"First Encounters\" was the first game to use procedural texturing to generate the vegetation, snow and other features on the planet surfaces. Mountain ranges, cliffs and alien landscapes and visual effects all contributed to the atmosphere of the game.\n\nThis third game in the \"Elite\" series is the direct sequel to \"\", and was followed by \"\" in 2014.\n\n\"First Encounters\" carried over the gameplay features from its immediate predecessor \"\", in that the game is a combination of trading, fighting, espionage, bombing and a variety of other military activities; the combat ratings were also carried over from the previous games. Like \"Elite II\", \"First Encounters\" features realistic Newtonian physics, the ability to seamlessly land on 1:1 scale planets in authentic 1:1 scale star systems, and rival factions for which the player can perform missions, gaining or losing standing accordingly. The game's graphics were an improvement on the previous game, introducing Gouraud shading and more extensive use of texture mapping. As well as employing the same open-ended gameplay of its predecessors, \"First Encounters\" also features a storyline which takes the player through a series of events starting with the \"Wiccan Ware Race\" and missions concerning an alien race called the Thargoids. Some of these missions can only be completed under specific circumstances, or with specific combat ratings. The missions take place between 3250 (the start-date of the game) and approximately 3255.\n\nComparing \"First Encounters\" to earlier games in the series, creator David Braben said that where the original \"Elite\" was \"basically just trading\" and \"Elite II\" positioned the trading as \"something to do while doing missions\", the developers had done \"almost no work\" expanding the trading for \"First Encounters\", as it was not seen as the focus of the game. The player's objective is instead to explore, have fun and \"find out what's happening with the aliens\", although how they achieve this would depend on how they played the game.\n\nIn addition to these now-established tenets of the \"Elite\" series, \"First Encounters\" added full motion video BBS character faces in the CD-ROM version and journals which report on happenings within the game's known universe, occasionally mentioning the player's exploits. The game also allows the player to earn special ships that are not available to buy. These ships are given as rewards for completing missions; the ships are the Turner-class \"Argent's Quest\", the Stowmaster-class fighter (which comes with the \"Argent's Quest\", equipped as the escape pod) and the Thargoid Warship, given to the player by the Thargoids at the completion of the Thargoid missions.\n\n\"First Encounters\" was the sequel to \"\". It was released by the financially struggling publisher, GameTek in Easter 1995. Due apparently to being published in an incomplete state, the game was significantly flawed in a number of respects on release. As FFE was originally riddled with many bugs, the game was extensively patched, later reissued as shareware (like \"Elite II\") but finally withdrawn from sale. This was followed by a lawsuit brought by David Braben against GameTek, accusing the publisher of forcing the studio to release the game too early. The lawsuit was settled out-of-court in 1999. \n\nAs the official support has ended and the game being a DOS game, \"First Encounters\" has difficulty running with post-DOS operating systems such as Windows 95, Windows 2000 and Windows XP. Only with DOS-emulators like DOSBox the game was playable.\n\nIn 2000 Frontier Developments announced that FFE would be open-sourced under a GPL-similar license allowing ports, but this never happened. In response the community took up the support of the game, which was successfully reverse engineered by John Jordan and ported for modern operating systems in October 2005. JJFFE was updated until December 2009 and was later, due to the source code availability, taken up by other community developers with improved ports like FFED3D or GLFFE.\n\n\"First Encounters\" was well reviewed, despite being released before the development team thought it was ready. While the game employed an advanced and realistic Newtonian mechanics flight model, rather than the original arcade-style engine, many players found it frustratingly difficult, particularly in combat. According to Frontier Developments the game shipped around 100,000 units. \n\n"}
{"id": "1896071", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896071", "title": "Bumblebee (Transformers)", "text": "Bumblebee (Transformers)\n\nBumblebee is a fictional robot superhero in the many continuities in the Transformers franchise. The character is a member of the Autobots, a group of sentient self-configuring modular extraterrestrial robotic lifeforms.\n\nIn most versions, Bumblebee is a small yellow Volkswagen Beetle, although since the live action movies, he has appeared as vehicles inspired by several generations of the Chevrolet American muscle cars – with the live-action film versions being a yellow Camaro with black racing stripes. The original vehicle-mode design was based on a classic European Type 1 Volkswagen Beetle. The character is named after the bumblebee, a black-and-yellow striped bee which inspired his paint scheme. Bumblebee appears in most of the series and later becomes the main protagonist in \"\", \"Bumblebee\", and \"\".\n\nBumblebee (known as Abejorro in Mexico, Bumble in Japan, Moscardo in Portugal, Űrdongó in Hungary, Maggiolino in Italy, Bourdon in France) is the \"little brother\" of the heroic or protagonistic Autobot faction and a mascot, constantly striving to prove himself in the eyes of the other robots—especially his leader, Optimus Prime. This often causes him to take risks that put him in danger. Although a bit of a smart aleck, he is a capable and reliable messenger and spy, his small size allowing him to go places that his larger commanders cannot. He is highly fuel-efficient, has great visual acuity, is particularly adaptable to undersea environments and transforms into a Saturn yellow Volkswagen Beetle. He was later reconstructed into a stronger, more mature form as Goldbug.\n\nAt BotCon 2010, Hasbro named Bumblebee as one of the first five robot inductees in the Transformers Hall of Fame.\n\nBumblebee was the second character to appear on-screen in the original \"Transformers\" animated series, while on a mission to recover a small clutch of energy conductors with Wheeljack. Bumblebee is subsequently among the Transformers aboard the \"Ark\", which crash landed on Earth, causing the Transformers within to be trapped in stasis for four million years. Awakening in 1984, Bumblebee helps Ironhide quell a raging river and uses his small size to help the human Autobot ally Sparkplug Witwicky plant explosives in the midst of a Decepticon mining operation.\n\nHe later befriends Sparkplug's son Spike, but on their first adventure together they are both kidnapped by the Decepticons, and Bumblebee's memory chip was altered as he unintentionally lured the other Autobots into a trap. Bumblebee recovered in time to help his fellow Autobots stop the Decepticons from sending Spike to Cybertron. After their first adventure, Bumblebee and Spike became best friends for life as they both realized that they make a good team.\n\nOn one of their missions, Bumblebee got injured with Spike inside from a battle with the Decepticons at a rocket base. Bumblebee was being repaired by Ratchet while his best friend was being fixed at the hospital but his mind ended up being transferred into the robot body of Autobot X, created by Sparkplug, so the doctors at the hospital can operate on his real one. When Spike left base as there was a side effect of the mind transfer, Bumblebee left afterwards to go look for his best friend but his radio transmitters weren't fixed yet. After finding Spike, Bumblebee tries to get his pal to come to his senses but failed when his best friend believed that he was tricking him. Bumblebee sees the Decepticons arriving at their location but they didn't see him so he was able to hear Megatron tell lies to his best friend, then leaving to go get Optimus Prime and the rest of his Autobot friends for help, who were helping with repairs at the rocket base they were battling at before. After arriving at the rocket base, Bumblebee tells Optimus that Megatron is manipulating Spike and that he was believing him. Bumblebee was asked to lead the way of their location by Optimus, who feared that the Decepticons would find out about Spike's messed up mind and would take advantage of the situation, so they can help their friend. Arriving where Spike was, Bumblebee and Prime tried talking some sense into him but it didn't work as they hoped it would, but they were both relieved when he did when Sparkplug was endangered. After the Decepticons left, Bumblebee gave his best friend a high five when he returned to his real body when it got all fixed up.\n\nBumblebee's next adventure would occur when he accompanied Spike and Sparkplug with Jazz to test out his new speakers but decided to head to headquarters so they wouldn't have to deal with his loud music. When Bumblebee returned to the headquarters he saw nobody but Bluestreak there and that Teletraan One was damaged. He then was dragged to the recharging chamber by Bluestreak, due to Megatron putting a personality destabilizer in their recharging chamber to turn all the Autobots evil. However, Bumblebee was saved when Jazz, Spike and Sparkplug arrived back just in time as Jazz knocked Bluestreak out for a while. After Sparkplug fixed Teletraan One, he, Bumblebee, Jazz and Spike became shocked when Teletraan One tells them that Megatron turned their friends from good to evil. With Bumblebee and Jazz being the only ones who were not affected from the personality destabilizer, Bumblebee decided to stop his comrades when he hears about Optimus Prime, Brawn and Prowl attacking an Air Force jet base with Spike accompanying him. Once they arrived, Bumblebee tried a few times to get through to Optimus but to no success. Bumblebee was relieved that his friends were free from the Decepticons control, after Sparkplug invented Attitude exchanger to counteract the personality destabilizer effects, except for Prime. Bumblebee took the last one, as there was no other ones left, as he wanted to make one final attempted to get Optimus back to his senses. Bumblebee tells his friend/leader that he's not evil and he believes in him, then encourages him to fight off Megatron's control also to not give in. Bumblebee quickly put the Attitude exchanger on Optimus, who heard his voice, leg which freed him from the Decepticons control. Bumblebee was given a hug by Prime as a thank you for not giving up on him and for saving him. After stopping the Decepticons, Bumblebee was thanked again by Optimus Prime, who also thanked everyone for their help, for what he did for him. Bumblebee with Spike gave Ratchet and Sparkplug tools as they needed to fix the Air Force jets the Autobots destroyed while under Megatron's control.\n\nBumblebee later befriended a girl named Carly, who admired the Autobots. While testing out one of Wheeljack's inventions, Bumblebee fought the Decepticons as they wanted to steal it which they succeed in doing. After the battle, Bumblebee and Spike went looking for Carly, who left base to help them as she believed it was her fault that the Decepticons got the invention because of her due to being there when they were testing it. Bumblebee and Spike found Carly with Ironhide, who was the one who rescued her from the Decepticons, then left but they didn't get very far when they saw that their friend wasn't behind them. Transforming back into robot mode, Bumblebee wondering what was going on then saw that Ironhide was immobilized. After the rest of the Autobots showed up, Bumblebee, along with Spike and Carly hid, and all agreed that they had to do something. Bumblebee signaled Jazz to do his sound and light show which distracted the Decepticons so Carly can reverse the process of Wheeljack invention. After the battle was won, Bumblebee encourage Spike to ask Carly out knowing that they have feelings for each other.\n\nWhen the body of the deceased Optimus Prime is recovered from space by a pair of Transformer-hating human scientists who intend to use it to lure the Autobots into a trap, Bumblebee is part of the rescue team led by Rodimus Prime to recover it. Entering the lab, some of the Transformers are exposed to rage-inducing alien spores that could infect them with the Hate Plague, which causes them to run wild, and although Bumblebee avoids infection, he is seriously damaged by the infected rampaging Superion. A member of the alien race called the Quintessons subsequently repair and restore Optimus Prime to life, so he can stop the Hate Plague and repair Bumblebee. The little Autobot was so severely damaged that he required an entire reconstruction and is rebuilt as a Throttlebot. In his new, shiny body, he comments that he has gone beyond just being plain old Bumblebee, and is now a \"gold bug\", prompting Optimus Prime to redub him Goldbug. Goldbug travels with Optimus Prime to the Decepticon planet of Chaar in order to secure a heat-resistant alloy that can protect him from the plague, only to be infected on the mission and later cured when Prime uses the power of the Matrix of Leadership to purge the plague. Because of an animation error, Bumblebee appears in a wide shot in a celebration alongside with Goldbug during the series' final episode. Bumblebee reappears in Generation 2: Redux, a Botcon magazine which is set after the events of the final episode as Goldbug battling the Decepticons in Switzerland along with Jazz, Sideswipe, Beachcomber and Seaspray and became Bumblebee once again in his G2 color by the power of Forestonite.\n\nIn \"\", Goldbug and the other Throttlebots were on Cybertron when Vector Sigma began to destabilize as a consequence of Optimus Prime releasing the Matrix's energy to cure the Hate Plague the previous year. The Decepticons soon invaded the planet in an attempt to take control of the computer, and Goldbug and the Throttlebots joined Dinobots Grimlock and Slag in holding the line against them. Unfortunately, they were knocked unconscious by the hypnotic power of the new Decepticon Headmaster Mindwipe, but they had managed to delay the Decepticons long enough for the Autobot Headmasters to arrive and take up the fight.\n\nThe Throttlebots disappeared after this encounter, suggesting they might have been destroyed, but they eventually resurfaced months later as the Decepticons were carrying out their final plan to destroy the Earth. Goldbug and the Throttlebots teamed up with Fastlane and Cloudraker to investigate the emergence of a \"Death Tower\" in Santiago, Chile, only to find Predaking there waiting for them. Naturally, the small 'bots were no match for the powerful combiner, but they fought bravely, clinging onto his limbs before being hurled aside. Luckily, the Autobot Targetmasters arrived in time to bail them out and take Predaking down. This is also because of the budget cut that happened in the middle of the movie.\n\nBumblebee was featured in the 1985 Find Your Fate Junior books \"Dinobots Strike Back\" by Casey Todd and \"Battle Drive\" by Barbara Siegel and Scott Siegel.\n\nBumblebee was featured in the 1985 audio and book adventure \"Satellite of Doom\" publishing by Kid Stuff Records & Tapes.\n\nBumblebee was featured in the 1993 \"Transformers: Generation 2\" coloring book \"Decepticon Madness\" by Bud Simpson.\n\nBumblebee has appeared in numerous comic books and related media printed by various publishers.\n\nBumblebee appeared in the voice actor play performed at BotCon 2004, in which a device built by Rhinox to stop Unicron from pulling victims from other dimensions inadvertently transports an Autobot shuttle under Bumblebee's command into the middle of a battle between Rattrap, Silverbolt, and Waspinator and a team of Unicron's agents. Bumblebee's shuttle is able to scoop up Rattrap and company when their ship is destroyed. After saving more of Unicron's victims from the Decepticons, Bumblebee's team returns to their own time.\n\nIn a story called \"By their Blasters you shall know them ...!\" from \"Transformers Comic-Magazin\" issue #12 by German comic publisher Condor Verlag Optimus Prime instructs Backstreet, Bumblebee and Ruckus on how to identify Autobots from Decepticons in battle using the Ark's computer. Pretender Bumblebee is one of those he displays to the Autobots.\n\nIn Devil's Due's first \"G.I. Joe vs. The Transformers\" crossover, the evil terrorist organization Cobra are the first to uncover the \"Ark\" and the Transformers slumbering within it, capturing and reformatting a large number of them to use them as war machines. Bumblebee and Wheeljack are able to avoid this fate, contact the team created to respond to the threat of Cobra, G.I. Joe, and help to free their fellow Autobots. Unlike most Autobots, who had new alternate modes, Bumblebee and Wheeljack had their original Generation 1 alternate modes in this series.\n\nIn the second crossover, Bumblebee is among the Autobots sent back in time due to an accident with the spacebridge computer Teletran-3. As part of a small group transported to the 1970s, Bumblebee is reformatted as a small economy car (this time, resembling an AMC Pacer) before the teamed-up Joes and Cobras return all the Transformers to present-day Cybertron.\n\nBumblebee takes center stage in the third crossover series, as he, Grimlock, Arcee, and Perceptor are sent to Earth to aid G.I. Joe in removing the influence of Cybertronian technology on the planet. Sporting his original alternate mode again, he is shown to have something of a crush on Arcee. When Cobra attacks the base, the Autobots help repel the Cobra Battle Android Trooper armies. Journeying to Cybertron to stop Serpentor, the mismatched group is ambushed first by Cannibalizers, then by Serpentor, Piranacon, Predaking and the Stunticons, with Bumblebee being badly injured as he runs right into Predaking's leg. He is then executed by Serpentor, who would later comment that Bumblebee's death is the only thing that ever really made him feel emotion. Despite the character being notoriously difficult to kill, it seems his death is permanent, as Serpentor comments that he felt something leave him, most likely his spark. A statue to his memory was seen in the final issue. His death would continue to have repercussions, as seen in the fourth series, in which Prime insists on journeying to Earth personally rather than expose any of his troops to the same fate.\n\nWhen Dreamwave Productions introduced their re-imagined version of Generation 1 continuity for the 21st Century, Bumblebee was present for the Autobots' new adventures once again. \"The War Within\", set in Cybertron's past, chronicled Bumblebee's early adventures in the Battle of Altihex and the defense of Iacon in the face of an attack by Shockwave.\n\nWhen Optimus Prime and Megatron vanish in an early spacebridge experiment, causing the Autobots and Decepticons to splinter into smaller factions, Bumblebee remains with the Autobots under Prowl's command.\n\nAs usual, Bumblebee is among the Transformers trapped in stasis aboard the crashed \"Ark\" who are reactivated on Earth in 1984. Although not depicted in fiction, the general events of the television series pilot seemed to take place in the Dreamwave continuity - with Bumblebee meeting and befriending Spike Witwicky.\n\nClassic Bumblebee was featured on the cover of \"Transformers Club Magazine\" #14.\n\nIn a possible future chronicled in the exclusive comic book available at BotCon 2005, Bumblebee featured as the espionage director of the Autobots. Having been on the trail of the Decepticon agent Flamewar for a long time, Bumblebee interrupts a communication between Flamewar and the Tripredacus Council and reveals that his agent, Ricochet, has installed a degenerative virus into Deathsaurus's clone army. With Flamewar now exposed, Bumblebee points out that she was nothing more than a liability to the Council, who blow her ship up.\n\nBased on the Transformers Classics toy line, the Timelines 2007 story is set 15 years after the end of the Marvel Comics story (ignoring all events of the Marvel UK and \"Generation 2\" comics). Megatron has survived the crash of the \"Ark\" on Earth, reformatted himself into a new form, and now leads Ramjet, Skywarp, Soundwave, Starscream, and the Constructicons. Optimus Prime has also returned to Earth commanding Bumblebee, Cliffjumper, Grimlock, Jetfire, Mirage, and Rodimus (formerly Hot Rod).\n\nIn \"Crossing Over\", when the Cybertronians Skyfall and Landquake arrive on Earth unexpectedly Megatron attempts to destroy them, but Optimus Prime and his Autobots are able to drive Megatron away.\n\nBumblebee appears in the story \"Generation 2: Redux\" in which he is among the reinforcements from Autobot City to respond to the Decepticon attack at the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland. Once there, the Autobots are able to defeat the Decepticons, but during the fight the Autobots are exposed to refined Forestonite, which enhances and mutates Cybertronian systems. He gets enhanced to his \"Generation 2\" form.\n\nFall of 2005 was the third re-launch for the \"Transformers\" comic series, this time under the management of IDW Publishing.\n\nIDW's core universe was introduced with the six-issue mini-series, \"\", making it clear that the company's take on the Generation 1 universe was radically different. Bumblebee appears as a member of a small team of Autobots under the command of Prowl, operating in secret on Earth out of \"Ark-19\". Still a Volkswagen Beetle, he (like the other Autobots) possesses the added ability to generate a \"holo-matter\" avatar of a young female to masquerade as a driver and to otherwise interact with humans. Working with Ratchet and a trio of young humans to search an abandoned Decepticon base, Bumblebee is able to take down Skywarp during a Decepticon attack, out-thinking the Decepticon and shooting him out of the sky despite his teleportation system. After Blitzwing and Skywarp bring the base down, Bumblebee helps save the humans, despite commenting previously that they would be acceptable losses. As Megatron then engages the traitorous Starscream in battle, Bumblebee does what he does best by spying on the fight; almost shot by the Battlechargers, he is saved by Prowl and Jazz. In the follow-up, \"\", he is left to run the \"Ark-19\" on his own.\n\nBumblebee was among the Autobots who opposed the Decepticons serving the elder gods in the IDW Publishing \"Infestation 2: Transformers\" comic.\n\nBumblebee, voiced by Dan Gilvezan, appeared in the TFcon 2009 voice actor play \"Bee for, Bee now\".\n\nBumblebee appears among the characters in \"Re-Unification\", the 2010 TFCon voice actor play prelude comic.\n\nBumblebee was one of eight playable characters in the 1986 Commodore 64 video game \"\".\n\nThe \"Classic\" toy line appeared in a simple Flash-based video game on the Hasbro web site called \"Transformers Battle Circuit\". In this one-on-one fighting game, players press the right and left arrow keys to try to overpower their opponent. Playable characters include Rodimus, Bumblebee, Grimlock, Jetfire, Starscream, Astrotrain, Trypticon, and Menasor. Optimus Prime and Megatron each appear as the boss the player must defeat to win the game.\n\nBumblebee appears in the 2003 video game \"Transformers\", voiced by Jack Merluzzi.\n\nBumblebee is one of the light-blue robots in the 2010 card game \"Monopoly Deal Transformers\".\n\nPopular Bumblebee-specific merchandise includes shirts and costumes based on the character.\nA parody of the \"Generation 1\" Transformers was aired in the December 23, 2008, episode of \"Frank TV\", called \"Frank the Halls\". In the story, Optimus Prime and his Autobots (Bumblebee, Jazz, and Wheeljack) battle Megatron and his Decepticons (Soundwave and Starscream) when Optimus runs out of gas. Optimus becomes enraged at the price of gas, steals the fuel from the annoying hybrid Autobot Prius Maximus, then joins the Decepticons in destroying the city.\n\nBumblebee appears in the \"Robot Chicken\" episode \"Junk in the Trunk\". In the segment he is in, he is whipped by a towel used by Grimlock in the locker room and later appears at Optimus's bedside before he dies of prostate cancer.\n\nMaggie Simpson appeared as Bumblebee in one episode's opening sequence to \"The Simpsons\" alongside the rest of the Simpson family rendered as Autobots.\n\nBumblebee is a clone of the original Bumblebee.\n\nIn \"Flash Forward, Part 3\", Jhiaxus, seeking to create a new unified faction of Transformers, \"borrowed\" personality components, forestonite, Hi-Q, and blueprints from Quantum Laboratories. One of these Transformers was a clone of Bumblebee. Bumblebee, along with the other clones, were introduced to Pyro as a second generation of Transformers. In \"Flash Forward, Part 5\", Bumblebee and Mirage greeted a clone of Sideswipe, unaware the clone was actually the original Sideswipe. In \"A Flash Forward, Part 6\", Bumblebee, Mirage, and Ironhide confronted the escaping Autobots, but Pyro convinced them to return to Earth with him.\n\n\nA redeco of Go-Bot High Beam, transforming into a yellow sports car. He features through-axle construction for incredibly fast zipping on flat, smooth surfaces, and is compatible with many tracks and playsets from Hot Wheels and Matchbox. This figure was later repurposed as the second-generation Bumblebee. This mold was also used to make \"Robots in Disguise\" (2001) Crosswise and Nightracer.\n\nBumblebee is the Japanese name of Perceptor in \"\". The Mini-Con Sparkplug was also based on the original Bumblebee, while Hot Shot was in fact going to be named Bumblebee but had his name changed due to trademark reasons.\n\nA PVC figurine was made for Perceptor/Bumble, part of the tenth act of Super Collection Figures made by Takara. There are two versions: one in cartoon colors and one in a silver color scheme.\n\nBumblebee is a member of Rodimus's crew from \"\". He appears only in a flashback and looks exactly like his Generation 1 counterpart. Bumblebee was originally supposed to be one of the main characters of the “Unicron Trilogy” but was replaced by Hot Shot.\n\nLed by Rodimus, the crew left Cybertron 8,000 years ago and created a new home world on the planet Omnitron.\n\nBumblebee appears as one of the main Autobot characters in the live-action \"Transformers\" film series and the protagonist of his own film \"Bumblebee\". He retains some elements from his Generation 1 design, such as the iconic horn-like pieces in his head, which are articulated in the films. The cautious but brave Bumblebee was given a different alternate mode from his original G1 incarnation; instead of a Volkswagen Beetle, he transforms into a rally yellow Chevrolet Camaro (the model year of which is upgraded in the first film). Director Michael Bay states in the special features of disc two of the first film's DVD release, that the change of Bumblebee's alternate mode was due to the fact that a Volkswagen Beetle reminded him of Herbie. Due to a battle injury, he is rendered effectively mute, and communicates through use of selected playback of radio and television signals. Though his original voice is restored at the end of the first \"Transformers\" film, he communicates solely through his radio in \"Revenge of the Fallen\", \"Dark of the Moon\" and \"Age of Extinction\". The biography for the Decepticon Hardtop figure states that he and Bumblebee are old rivals and it was not Megatron who damaged Bumblebee's vocal processor, but a shot from Hardtop's gun. This is in almost direct opposition of the film's prequel.\n\nBay stated in an early interview that Bumblebee stands about , but the official guide to the \"Transformers\" video game says he is .\n\nThe vehicles used for Bumblebee, Ironhide, Jazz and Ratchet were put on display by General Motors at the 2007 Detroit River Walk Festival a little over a week before the U.S. release of the film.\n\nIn \"Hot Rod\" magazine's Nov. 2006 issue, Bumblebee was a feature article. Originally a worn-out 1969 Camaro, producers settled on a 1977 model. It is painted yellow with black stripes, primer and rust patches, riveted hood scoop, Cragar SS wheels up front, Eric Vaughn Real Wheels in the back, marine-grade vinyl seats, and even an eight-track player. The Camaro Concept model was built using a 2005 Holden Monaro by Saleen, with the body built from the same GM R&D molds that were used in the original 2006 Camaro Concept (the Monaro and Camaro share the same Zeta platform). Bumblebee is armed with a plasma cannon that is capable of selective fire. The 1977 Camaro movie vehicle was sold on eBay with a winning bid of U.S. $40,100.01.\n\nAs a tribute to the original form of Bumblebee, a yellow Volkswagen Beetle appears next to him at the car dealership. Bumblebee damages the Beetle in order to ensure that Sam purchases him. He also has a bee-shaped air freshener attached to his rear-view mirror with the words \"Bee-otch\". The air freshener was the subject of a lawsuit for $850,000 due to its alleged resemblance to another design.\n\nSince his conversion from 1977 Camaro to 2006 Camaro Concept, Bumblebee's alternate mode continues to evolve throughout the film series.\n\nIn \"Revenge of the Fallen\", he sports a different set of alloy wheels (apparently, in the first two films are actually hubcaps made from composite to look like a set of wheel-disc brake) a custom front bumper. It also comes a unique Chevrolet logo design with red outlines in it, and redesigned foglights.\n\nFor \"\" (now a Camaro SS), his color changes from yellow to amber with thicker black stripes that run across his hood, roof and trunk. In addition, he will have dark-colored rims and side mirrors, as well as a rear spoiler. Also, in Transformers Dark of the Moon, he has a stealth force battle mode in which he can use his weapons in car mode without fully transforming and still being able to seat a driver and passengers.\n\nIn Transformers: Age of Extinction, he transformers into a modified 1967 Chevrolet Camaro to avoid from being hunted down by Cemetery Wind. This design sports just a yellow front bumper and a rear spoiler, this vehicle is looking similar to the Dodge Hellcat.\n\nDuring the Autobots come to Storm KSI however, he scans a 2014 Chevrolet Camaro Concept with an all-new look, with some major changes. Now including a new front look with some advanced lamps including a dove black front bumper, black-long sideskirts, and new black rims. This time, there is only one stripes in the hood and a back license plate that says \"900 STRA\". People say that it is the most common license plate, it is specified that this means Mighty Stra.\n\nSometimes he is also known as N.B.E.-02 and B-127.\n\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" named Bumblebee as their seventh-favorite computer-generated character.\n\nIn \"Transformers: Defiance\" #1, back on ancient Cybertron, Bumblebee, and Cliffjumper are tasked to watch over the AllSpark at the temple at Simfur. In issue #3, Megatron learns that Optimus has broken into his room and sends Bumblebee, Camshaft, Cliffjumper, Jazz, Prowl, and Smokescreen to arrest Optimus Prime for treason. Optimus demands to speak directly to Megatron, but while en route to Megatron's location, they are ambushed by Barricade, Brawl, Crankcase, Frenzy, Starscream, Skywarp, and Thundercracker, under orders to kill them all. Smokescreen is able to cover Optimus and his group's retreat in the confusion of an explosion. In issue #4, Arcee, Bumblebee, Cliffjumper, Jazz, and Smokescreen ambush Ironhide, who they believed works for Megatron, but Ironhide instead joins Optimus Prime's Autobots. Arcee and Bumblebee later spy on the building of the Decepticon starship \"Nemesis\".\n\nThe \"\" reveals that in the battle of Tyger Pax, Megatron's forces attack, searching for the All Spark. Bumblebee's squad (which includes Arcee) attempts to hold off the Decepticons, but are eventually overwhelmed. They are captured and tortured by Swindle, with Megatron intervening personally to torture Bumblebee for information. However, they refuse to speak long enough for Prime's secret plan to take effect—launching the AllSpark into outer space. Megatron attempts to pursue it, but Bumblebee stops him. An enraged Megatron rips Bumblebee's arms off and crushes his voice capacitor, promising to seize the AllSpark for himself eventually. Bumblebee recovers and is repaired, although his voice is damaged beyond repair. Bumblebee then volunteers to head into space to stop Megatron from acquiring the All Spark.\n\nEventually arriving on Mars in his protoform mode, Bumblebee then proceeds to Earth in 2003, his arrival tracked by the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nUpon landing in New York City, Bumblebee assumes the form of a beat-up Chevrolet Camaro, all the while avoiding the agents of the government organization known as Sector 7, who refer to him as NBE-2 (or Non-Biological Extraterrestrial 2). Bumblebee then downloads information on Captain Archibald Witwicky. Arriving at the asylum where he had once been incarcerated, he finds it now a dilapidated ruin. Damaged by a pursuing Barricade, he then finds AllSpark-like emissions somewhere in New Mexico—unaware it is a trap set by Sector 7. However, their plan to capture him is thwarted when Starscream, Barricade and Blackout arrive. As the Decepticons shoot Sector 7's trap to pieces, Bumblebee escapes—unaware the Decepticons had let him go so that they could follow him and see what he knew about the All Spark. He is last seen in the series heading for Tranquility, Nevada—home of Captain Witwicky's descendant Sam.\n\nIn the comic adaptation of the film, Bumblebee downloads information on the internet about the Concept Camaro car and took on its form instead of driving past in a tunnel, as seen in the film.\n\nHe also appears in the official movie sequel comic called \"The Reign of Starscream\".\n\nIn \"\", the Autobots aid the human soldiers after the battle in Mission City, destroying the All Spark-powered machines that were created. After Ratchet finishes repairing Bumblebee's legs, a trailer is obtained for Optimus Prime to carry the remains of Jazz. The Autobots then leave Mission City before the Sector 7 personnel arrive to claim the remains of the Decepticons. About a month later, Epps and Lennox contact Optimus Prime, Ratchet and Ironhide about aiding them in escorting the remains of the Decepticons to the naval yard. Unknowingly they are spied on by Barricade, who transmits the information to Starscream.\n\nBumblebee appears in \"Transformers: Tales of the Fallen\" #1, where Barricade kidnaps Sam in order to flush out Bumblebee and learn where the AllSpark fragment is. Bumblebee saves Sam and fights Barricade, who escapes in the process.\n\nBumblebee appears in \"Transformers: Nefarious\" #1, set months after the events of the 2009 film. Bumblebee, Breakaway, , Knock Out and Dune Runner are sent to investigate spark fragments detected at Kingdom Petrochemicals. Arriving first, Breakaway is warned by to leave, but unwilling to give in, the Autobot is swiftly defeated. Bumblebee and his team fire on Soundwave, who escapes.\n\nThe drone calling itself Brains runs into Bumblebee and Sam Witwicky in Philadelphia.\n\nNote: Events occurring in the alternate universe where Megatron won the battle of Mission City are in \"italics\".\n\n\"In \"Twilight's Last Gleaming Part 3\", Bumblebee attempts to take on Megatron in the Sector 7 base. Meanwhile, Mikaela attempts to free Optimus Prime, but she is attacked by Frenzy.\"\n\n\"Bumblebee appears in issue #17 of the Titan Transformers Magazine, in a story called \"Return to Cybertron Part 1\". In this story, he is among the Autobots that go to Cybertron.\"\n\n\"Bumblebee returns in issue #22 of the Titan Transformers Magazine series in a story called \"The Decepticon who Haunted Himself.\"\"\n\nBumblebee also appears in the prequel novel \"\". Here, it is revealed he could still communicate with the other Autobots via digital link. Bumblebee is part of Prime's Autobot team searching for the All Spark, and is described as one of the Autobots' best scouts. He is sent after the human vessel \"Ghost-1\" (reverse-engineered from studies of Megatron) to make contact, but is ambushed and forced underground by Starscream. Encountering giant rock-chewing worms, he is saved by Optimus Prime. Heading into the atmosphere once again, he and Ratchet took on Barricade, but are unable to stop Starscream from destroying the human vessel.\n\nAccording to his extended biography from the Target store-exclusive Robo-Vision web site, Hardtop came to Earth and discovered the Witwicky home before any of the other Decepticons, but was unable to attack the Witwickys because Bumblebee found him first and buried him under a hundred tons of rubble in the Rocky Mountains.\n\nBumblebee appears in the 2007 live-action \"Transformers\" movie, returning to his role as the friend of the Autobots' human ally – in this case, Sam Witwicky. Sam possesses the glasses of his great-great-grandfather Captain Archibald Witwicky, a famous explorer. Unknown to Sam, the glasses are engraved with the coordinates showing the location of the life-giving All Spark. Bumblebee is assigned to guard Sam from the Decepticons, and poses as a dilapidated 1977 Chevrolet Camaro as Sam and his father are buying a car for him. They eventually purchase Bumblebee, due in no small part to Bumblebee damaging every other car at the dealership to ensure his purchase. Later, Bumblebee drives away from Sam's home to summon the Autobots. Sam thinks Bumblebee is being stolen, and chases the car on his bike. Sam then witnesses Bumblebee transforming into robot mode and reports it to the police, who believe he is on drugs. Bumblebee returns to Sam house to come get him but he ran away from him which resulted a chase through town. After Sam gets attack by Barricade, Bumblebee came to his and his crush Mikaela Banes, who followed Sam, rescue as was able to get them away. Bumblebee battles Barricade while Sam and Mikaela battle Frenzy with Bumblebee, Sam and Mikaela ending up victorious. Bumblebee was able to earn Sam's trust when he understood that he's doesn't want to hurt them. When Mikaela criticizes the poor condition of Bumblebee's vehicle mode, he scans a passing Camaro Concept and transforms into the same model. Bumblebee then drives Sam and Mikaela to an alley where they meet the other Autobots as they properly introduced Bumblebee, due to his voice being damage in battle, to Sam and tells him that he is his guardian also they explain why he talks through the radio. They return to Sam's house and retrieve the glasses, but a secret government organization, Sector 7, arrests Sam and Mikaela. The Autobots attempt to rescue them but Bumblebee is captured and taken by Sector 7. There he is tested and tortured by the Sector 7 scientists using electric shocks that appear to hurt him. Sam eventually negotiates his release. Bumblebee survives the massive battle at the film's climax, although he loses the use of his legs after helping Ironhide deflect missiles from Starscream. With Mikaela's aid, he is able to rejoin the battle supported by a tow truck (later confirmed to be the Autobot Longarm), and destroys Brawl. After the battle, Bumblebee is fully repaired and asks to stay with Sam and is granted permission from both Sam and Optimus Prime. He is later seen alongside Ironhide, Ratchet, and Optimus watching the sunset while Sam and Mikaela recline on his hood at the end of the movie.\n\nBumblebee is voiced by Mark Ryan in the films, but he mostly speaks with his radio, having had his voice processor damaged (though his actual voice squeaks and whines laboriously through much of the movie). He also speaks with quotes from television shows and movies, in a way similar to Wreck-Gar from the 1986 film and season three of the G1 cartoon series. Screenwriter Roberto Orci explained Bumblebee regained his voice through the regenerative laser Ratchet fires at his neck as they meet, and it eventually works its magic by the end of the film. He agreed this was not made clear. Frenzy is regenerated upon coming into contact with the All Spark, and so it is entirely plausible that Bumblebee's voice, along with his legs, is also healed by the AllSpark, though no mention of this is made in the film. It was said that making Bumblebee mute was to show that his bond with Sam went beyond words.\n\nBumblebee also appears in the film's sequel, \"\". When a fragment of the AllSpark inadvertently turns the kitchen appliances in Sam's home into feral robots, Bumblebee intervenes to save him and his family. In doing so, he nearly destroys their house. He still uses his radio to speak, despite his vocal processors being repaired in the first film. However, he does respond half-way when Sam tells him to get in the garage by saying \"whatever.\" Bumblebee shows excitement at the thought of going with Sam to college, only to be disappointed later when Sam tells him that he can not come. Because of the incident at the Witwickys' he is also forced to leave their garage. Soon after Sam begins his semester at college, Bumblebee follows him and tries to alert him to the Decepticon Pretender (named Alice) that is following Sam. As both Sam and Alice are riding inside Bumblebee, the Autobot attempts to warn Sam through his radio. Having failed at this, Bumblebee intentionally brakes hard multiple times and throws Alice around the interior in an attempt to damage the Pretender. Bumblebee then proceeds to spray lubricant over Alice, thereby embarrassing Sam and forcing Alice to flee.\n\nSoon after Megatron and begin to torture Sam, Bumblebee arrives alongside Optimus Prime to fight Megatron, Starscream and Grindor. After Optimus dies, Bumblebee arrives with , Ironhide and Ratchet to cover Sam's escape. As they mourn for Optimus, Sam tells Bumblebee that he has failed the Autobots, but Bumblebee tells Sam through his radio, ... \"You are the person I care for most in my life, and if there is anything you need I won't be far away...\" After taking Sam, Mikaela, Leo and Simmons to the Smithsonian museum to reawaken , Bumblebee then travels with the humans through a Space Bridge to Egypt (caused by Jetfire) along with Jetfire, the Twins and Mudflap, and Wheelie to find the Matrix of Leadership. While the twins have a sibling argument (resulting in a fist fight) inside the ruins of Petra (which supposedly houses the Matrix when everyone thinks it is a dead end), Bumblebee breaks them up and tosses them out before seeing their fight. But once seeing the Tomb's entrance after the Twins' brawl reveals it, Bumblebee helps the humans enter it by blasting the rest of the wall off.\n\nDuring the final confrontational battle, Sam and Mikaela inadvertently spring a trap set by (who uses Sam's parents as the bait). Bumblebee stays hidden from Rampage's sight, allowing Sam to put Rampage in a spot where Bumblebee can initiate a surprise attack. During the subsequent fight Ravage attacks him from behind and jumps on his back. After a brief struggle, Bumblebee gets a hold of Ravage and literally tears him apart with his hands, allowing him to finish off and kill Rampage. With Sam's parents free, Sam tells Bumblebee to take care of them, thus removing him from most of the final fight. After Sam is killed by Megatron, Bumblebee arrives with Sam's parents and sees Sam's body on the ground, he is heartbroken, overcome with sadness and stricken with sorrow, believing that he has failed in his duty to protect Sam, but is overjoyed to see him return. Bumblebee is among the remaining Autobots at the end of the film.\n\nIn \"\", Bumblebee no longer lives with Sam and goes on other missions with the Autobots such as dismantling an illegal nuclear facility in the Middle East. This is the first time the stealth force upgrade is shown in the movie. When Sam arrives with Carly, Wheelie and Brains, Bumblebee saves them from the soldiers taking them captive. Bumblebee is reassigned to protect Sam and moves back in with him. Bumblebee later teams up with Sideswipe and Dino/Mirage to take out Hatchet. While Dino/Mirage clings on to hatchet with his grapplers, Bumblebee and Sideswipe shoot their stealth force weapons. While trying to protect Sentinel Prime, Bumblebee and the other Autobots are betrayed and attacked by him. Sentinel brutally kills Ironhide, but Bumblebee manages to escape. After Sentinel forces the Autobots' exile from Earth, Bumblebee sadly says goodbye to Sam, but reunites with him in Chicago where he helps him rescue Carly and kill Laserbeak. After Sam kills Starscream, Bumblebee saves him and Lennox from a great fall. Bumblebee is captured by Soundwave and is nearly executed in front of Sam (telling Sam \"We gave them a hell of a run\") after Barricade executes Que before Wheelie and Brains save him at the cost of their own lives, allowing him to break free and attack Soundwave. Bumblebee battles Soundwave while the other Autobots fight the other Decepticons and proves more than a match for the Decepticon spy-master, even managing to kill another Decepticon during the fight. Finally Bumblebee knocks Soundwave off-balance with a shot to the leg, knocks his sonic cannon from his hand and uppercuts his plasma cannon into his chest, firing at the same time, destroying Soundwave's head and killing him. Bumblebee fights Sentinel alongside the other Autobots and humans; he is no match for him, but avoids injury. After Sam kills Dylan Gould, Bumblebee destroys the Control Pillar by crashing through it, shutting off the Space Bridge and destroying Cybertron and the remaining Decepticons. Bumblebee survives the battle and gives Sam a bunch of gaskets to use as rings while playing wedding music after Sam and Carly admit they love each other. Though Sam says to Bumblebee that he's thinking too fast. He replies by 'saying', \"I'm just trying to help out.\" Ratchet compliments Bumblebee for his bravery.\n\nBumblebee returns in \"\". He has a new vehicle mode, a modified 1967 Chevrolet Camaro, before he scans a yellow 2014 Camaro and turns into a 2014 Chevrolet Camaro concept, because of this his robot mode has been changed as well and resembles one design of Bumblebee from the Generation 1 IDW comics. In the end of \"Age of Extinction\", Bumblebee assumed the Autobot leadership and protecting the Yeager family as Optimus blasts off to space along with the Seed, finding the mysterious Creators. Though Bumblebee mostly can't speak in the film and still relies on radio communication, he is shown to be able to express limited speech but in a more high-pitched voice, possibly meaning his voice box is healing.\n\nBumblebee returns in \"\", as the last appearance of this incarnation. In the former, he now displays the ability to separate and reassemble himself during combat, as shown when he battles the TRF soldiers in order to protect Cade. He is also revealed to have helped the United States Army Air Force to fight the Nazi Party during World War II, and transformed into a Mercedes-Benz 770. He also regained his voice during his battle with Optimus Prime. After Optimus Prime regains control of himself, Bumblebee and the rest of the newly allied Knights meet up with the rest of the Autobots. During the final battle, Bumblebee is shown with Hot Rod flying in a ship and is attacking Megatron and his forces. At one point, Bumblebee shoots at Infernocus, a Decepticon combiner, and is shot down. Bumblebee then leads Hound and Optimus against Megatron and Nitro Zeus. After they go weightless, Bumblebee shoots Nitro Zeus in the back of the head. Finally, Bumblebee sneaks up behind Quintessa and shoots her, supposedly killing her. Bumblebee is last seen getting ready to leave Earth to restore Cybertron with the Autobots.\n\nBumblebee is a primary focus in the spin-off and reboot movie \"Bumblebee\", where he is the main protagonist (albeit he is designated as B-127 for the first part of the film). He first appears on Cybertron along with other Autobots, including Optimus Prime. As the Decepticon battalion overwhelms them, Optimus Prime forces a retreat and tasks B-127 with traveling to Earth and establish a base for them. Upon crash-landing on Earth in a forest, he is intercepted by Sector Seven forces, led by US Army Ranger Jack Burns, scanning a Military jeep in an attempt to escape. As he attempts to flee from them, he is ambushed by the Decepticon Seeker Blitzwing. When B-127 is subdued, Blitzwing demands the location of his comrades, but he pledges to \"never talk\", prompting the Seeker to rip out his voice synthesizer. Despite this, before Blitzwing can execute him, the Scout jams one of the Decepticon's own missiles into his chest before blasting it, killing Blitzwing in the detonation. With his memory cells severely damaged, B-127 scans a nearby Volkswagen Beetle before entering stasis.\n\nBrought back in vehicle mode to a junkyard, he is eventually found in a boatyard by a teenage girl named Charlie Watson, who unwittingly activates a homing signal that reaches 3 Transformers on a moon of Saturn: Decepticons Shatter and Dropkick as well as the Autobot Cliffjumper. The 2 Decepticons decide to come to Earth to hunt for B-127 instead before killing Cliffjumper. Charlie is able to get the Beetle working after some time and she drives the car home after her uncle gives it to her as a birthday gift. Back in her garage, she is attempting to fix the Beetle when a part falls out from its undercarriage, B-127 abruptly transforms after Charlie shines her light on his mechanical face. After discovering he is as afraid of the girl as she is of him, she compassionately converses with the Autobot, naming him \"Bumblebee\" after hearing the warbled buzzes and beeping noises he makes. The following day, Bumblebee is taught by Charlie to maintain his cover in a secluded beach, who tells him he should always assume vehicle mode unless they're alone. Bumblebee is also later discovered by Memo, a boy who has a crush on Charlie and is sworn to secrecy by her.\n\nAfter going on a few humorous adventures with the humans, Bumblebee is eventually discovered and captured by Sector Seven, along with Shatter and Dropkick. He is later brought to an air base where he is tortured by Shatter and Dropkick about the Autobots. They activate a holographic message in the scout of Optimus Prime intending to retreat to Earth with the other Autobots. Shatter and Dropkick resolve to in turn send a message to the Decepticons on Cybertron to invade Earth before they leave a critically injured Bumblebee for dead. He is then revived by Charlie who uses Sector Seven's high voltage guns to do so, restoring his memories. After escaping Jack Burns and his unit's attempts to hold him back, Bumblebee resolves to set out to stop the Decepticons. Upon reaching the tower where Shatter and Dropkick are, he makes Charlie hide before engaging in a fierce battle with Dropkick in a dry dam area. After a rather lengthy battle, Bumblebee uses a chain entangle Dropkick before yanking it to shred him apart, destroying him, while Charlie makes her way to the tower by climbing a nearby crane. When Jack Burns and his men arrive to try and stop Shatter as well, she shoots down their helicopter, but Bumblebee is able to catch it in time before it can crash, saving Burns' life. Charlie manages to deactivate the Cybertronian homing beacon on the tower, causing an enraged Shatter to pursue her. However, Bumblebee stops her from doing so, but is himself pinned down by the Decepticon. He blasts a nearby dam wall, causing it to give way and flood the dam. Bumblebee sinks into the waves while Shatter is crushed against a ship, destroying her as well. Charlie dives in to save Bumblebee and the pair eventually reach the surface. Afterwards, Charlie and Bumblebee head to the Golden Gate Bridge where she tearfully bids goodbye to him as she knows the scout has a greater purpose on Earth. Before driving off, Bumblebee scans and transforms into a 1977 Camaro that resembles the Camaro seen in the 2007 film. He then rendezvouses with a Red Freightliner truck on the bridge, revealed to be Optimus Prime in disguise. Meeting properly in a forest, Prime congratulates Bumblebee, assuring him that the Autobots have a future thanks to his efforts. The scout asserts his new name while witnessing more Autobots arriving on Earth.\n\nIn 1, Bumblebee and Ironhide are protecting NEST Command when two Decepticons, Soundwave and Bludgeon invade the area. Ironhide goes outside to deal with Bludgeon, while Soundwave ambushes Bumblebee from inside. Bumblebee is easily thrown down by Soundwave. Bumblebee tries to fire a shot from his shoulder gun, but Soundwave redirects the acoustic energy back at him. Bumblebee deduces that he cannot deflect several rounds at once, and begins rapidly firing at Soundwave. The Decepticon is not able to take in so much, and finally falls. Later, Bumblebee traps Soundwave in a magnetically sealed bubble in \"Cyber Missions 2\".\n\nBumblebee is a playable character, and is the most-used character in the Autobot campaign, where the character uses Bumblebee in nine missions in the Autobot campaign, out of the total 18. He is playable in both the old and new Camaro cars. Bumblebee also appears as a boss in the Decepticon campaign, with a radial blast attack.\n\nBumblebee is among the playable characters in the 2009 \"Revenge of the Fallen\" video game by Activision.\n\nThe film version of Bumblebee is playable in Hasbro's Net Jet \"Transformers\" fighting game \"Transformers Battle Universe\". Although other playable Transformers in the game have several incarnations featured, no other versions of Bumblebee are playable.\n\nBumblebee is among the characters who appear in the \"TRANSFORMERS CYBERVERSE Battle Builder Game\".\n\nBumblebee is one of the Autobots featured in at Universal Studios theme parks. In the ride, Bumblebee disembodies Ravage while Evac escapes from the Decepticon attack on N.E.S.T. headquarters. Towards the end of the ride, Bumblebee saves Evac from falling off a building after Evac kills Megatron with the AllSpark shard.\n\nBumblebee appears in the episode of \"Robot Chicken\" called \"Tell My Mom\", voiced by Seth Green. Sam Witwicky finds Bumblebee in Bobby Bolivia's used car lot and they go on an adventure, while Scooter is the only thing cheap in the lot. Bumblebee is portrayed as a fifth-generation Camaro.\n\nDuring the final battle of the 2017 \"Power Rangers\" film, the Red Ranger, while piloting his T-Rex Zord, accidentally steps on a yellow Camaro of a similar model as the live-action Bumblebee. He throws the car at an army of Putties and shouts, \"Sorry, Bumblebee!\" as the car makes impact.\n\nBumblebee appears in the \"Transformers Animated\" series in 2008 as a yellow hot hatch undercover police car (scanned from a vehicle driven by Detroit Police Captain Fanzone). The character of Bumblebee in \"Animated\" is described as a hot headed racing young Autobot who likes video games, making him more akin to \"Armada\" than the original Bumblebee. He does however retain the traditional warm-heartedness and human-friendly attitude of the original due to his friendship with and Bulkhead. Although considered childish and self-centered by many of his fellow Autobots, Bumblebee shows a loyal and caring side for his friends, and can be considered protective of Sari Sumdac, to the extent of blocking shots, blasts, and missiles from harming her. This was first shown in \"Transform and Roll Out! Part 3\" when he deflected a shot from Starscream that was aimed at Sari. The blast rendered him unconscious until Sari healed him with her Key. He is the kid-friendly character of the show.\n\nBumblebee has a retractable face plate he uses when he goes into combat and a retractable weapon (called \"energy stingers\") in both hands. He can use the wheels on his feet in robot mode as motorized roller blades.\n\nIn the episode \"Autoboot Camp\", Bumblebee has flashbacks to his days as an Autobot trainee. During training, he met Bulkhead, Longarm, Ironhide, and Wasp. The group was under the command of Drill Sergeant Sentinel Minor, who gave Bumblebee his name (after calling him a \"bumbler\"). Bumblebee would often say or do the wrong thing, resulting in the entire platoon receiving Transformation push-ups as a result, which made him unpopular with Wasp and Ironhide. One day, Bumblebee heard someone communicating with Megatron. Believing the traitor to be Wasp, Bumblebee (with help from Longarm) discovered evidence in Wasp's locker. For discovering the traitor, Sentinel was prepared to give Bumblebee Elite Guard membership. However, Bumblebee gave up that chance by taking the rap for Bulkhead, who had previously knocked a building onto Sentinel, and was about to be removed from training, joining his new friend as a Space Bridge technician. Bulkhead and Bumblebee were assigned to a Space Bridge repair ship under the command of Optimus Prime, along with Ratchet. Both he and Bulkhead were the first to encounter Prowl before he joins their group.\n\nIn the series finale, during a rescue mission to save Arcee, who was on the moon, Bumblebee manages to settle the score with Shockwave before he and Bulkhead put him under arrest. After the Autobots learn of Prowl's ultimate sacrifice, they take the sparkless body of Prowl and the captured Megatron, Lugnut, and Shockwave to Cybertron. On their arrival home, they are greeted and cheered on by the other Autobots for their victory over the evil and malevolent leader of the Decepticons.\n\nBumblebee appeared in the 2008 BotCon voice actor play \"Bee in the City\", voiced by Bumper Robinson. In this story Professor Sumdac attempted to create a teleportation system to get the Autobots to Cybertron, but an interaction with Sari's key ended up transporting Optimus Prime, Bumblebee and Sari to Transtech Cybertron, where they met Flareup and his friends were detained by Shockwave while he was deemed not a threat. Bumblebee teamed up with transformer named \"Joe\" to help him and Flareup get their friends. But after Joe exposed himself as a Megatron and uses Sari's key to create an army to begin a reign of terror, Bumblebee pointed out the world's bureaucratic nature that resulted in a mutiny. Afterwards the Autobots and Sari returned to their own dimension.\n\nSet shortly after the events of \"Total Meltdown\" is the \"Transformers: Animated\" comic issue #2 by IDW Publishing. In it, Bumblebee and Prowl apprehend the Angry Archer as the villain attempts to steal money from a used car salesman. In doing so, they reveal the holographic trickery of the Detroit superhero known as The Wraith. With the secret of his power revealed, The Wraith loses much of the respect he used to command in Detroit. The Wraith attempts to stop Cyrus \"The Colossus\" Rhodes from escaping prison, but is unable to fool the villain now that the secret is public, forcing the Autobots to stop Rhodes and making The Wraith look foolish. The Wraith then attempts to discredit Bumblebee at a college football game by trapping the Autobot with a car boot and using his holograms to make a fake Bumblebee attack the stadium. Bumblebee eventually escapes and the other Autobots help capture The Wraith before having him placed in a mental institution.\n\nBumblebee is one of the five playable characters in the 2008 \"Transformers Animated\" video game for the Nintendo DS.\n\nIn the \"Transformers: Timelines\" series, Goldbug is an evil alternate reality version of Bumblebee.\n\nAccording to his official biography, Goldbug was once a young drifter known as Bumblebee. He survived on the streets of Polyhex with no real purpose. He became skilled at sneaking around, stealing, eavesdropping and blackmailing. He eagerly joined the Autobots in hopes of finding a place to belong and where his unsavory activities would be tolerated. When the war began, Bumblebee showed extreme bravery in battle and often sought ways to be noticed by command. In time, he worked his way up the ranks of the Autobots and when the Autobot Seeker Drench was destroyed, Bumblebee was offered an upgraded form and a new identity as Goldbug, to take his place.\n\nGoldbug is paranoid that one of his fellow Autobots will betray him and try to take his place, as he did to his former superiors.\n\nThe Botcon 2008 set was chosen as the \"Action Figure Digest Hot Pick.\"\n\nGoldbug appears in the 2008 April Fool's comic \"Shattered Expectations\" by Fun Publications.\n\nGoldbug appears as a member of Optimus Prime's forces in the \"Transformers: Timelines\" story \"Shattered Glass.\" Goldbug and Blurr report to Optimus Prime the rumors that Megatron is planning an attack. When the Decepticons attack the Ark launch site Blurr, Goldbug and Rodimus compete for who could destroy the most Decepticons, but thanks to Cliffjumper the Decepticon attack is successful.\n\nGoldbug appears in the fiction \"Dungeons & Dinobots\", a text-based story. He is among the Autobots who attack the Decepticons at the Arch-Ayr fuel dump. He is later sent to capture rogue Dinobots for the Autobots. He is part of the group that captures Swoop.\n\nIn \"Do Over\" Goldbug conspires with Rodimus to take over the Autobots. Together they steal the Ark, evicting any crew members who are loyal to Optimus Prime before blasting off to Earth. The Ark then crashes on Earth.\n\nGoldbug is among the Autobots brought back online. He initially commands a small group of Autobots who find Rodimus. After losing a fight with Rodimus for leadership Goldbug participates in the attack on Burpleson Air Force Base.\n\nBumblebee is one of the main group of Autobots in the 2010 computer-animated series \"\". Bumblebee is younger than most of the Autobots, and lost his voice box thanks to Megatron during the Great War. Bumblebee remains more playful than the other Autobots despite his lack of voice, and has come to rely on his speed as his most valuable asset in battle. Bumblebee is extremely similar to his movie counterpart, sharing the similar vehicle and robot forms, the same lack of voice, and his close relationship to a human boy. It is also revealed in the series finale episode \"Deadlock\" that Bumblebee's mouth was covered by a face plate vaguely resembling that of Optimus Prime's that helped him to create the alternative beeping noises he uses as his main form of communication throughout the series. Later in the series he changes his color scheme by reversing the colors, resembling Bumblebee's original 1976 paint scheme in the 2014 \"Age of Extinction\" film.\n\nBumblebee returns as the central protagonist of the sequel series \"\", with Will Friedle reprising his role. Set five years after the events of \"Prime\", Bumblebee becomes the leader of a group of Autobots that end up on Earth to fight a generation of Decepticons who have re-emerge on the planet after a prison ship crash, being previously put in stasis before the war was over. In later seasons this expands to battling old enemies from Prime, Stunticons, and the corruption of Cybertron itself. \nA constant running gag throughout the first season is Bumblebee's inability to come up with a decent command for his team to mobilize, in the vein of Optimus Prime's famous order to \"roll out\". Bumblebee retains a similar vehicle mode as he did in \"Prime\", now a 1992 Chevrolet Camaro. However, his robot mode has gone through a serious redesign. Notably retaking his original primarily yellow color scheme rather than the dominantly black one he took at the end of \"Prime\".\n\nBumblebee appears in the novels \"Transformers: Exodus\" and \"\".\n\nBumblebee losing his voice was the focus of the short story \"Bumblebee at Tyger Pax\" By Alex Irvine.\n\nBumblebee appears as a playable character in the 2010 video game \"\". In the Autobot campaign, he is first seen racing across the war-torn streets of Iacon in search of . Upon rendezvousing with Optimus, he relays the message of Zeta Prime's death at the hands of ; after which, he joins Optimus and Ratchet in their resistance against the Decepticons on the planet. He later appears in the final level of the game, where Bumblebee teams up with Optimus and Ironhide to prevent the Decepticon Titan, Trypticon from destroying Iacon.\n\nIn \"\", the sequel to \"War for Cybertron\", players start as Bumblebee in the first level. He appears throughout the game as well.\n\nWith the exception of Optimus Prime, Bumblebee is the only character to appear in all three TV shows set within the Aligned Continuity, including \"\" and \"\". Frank Welker recorded actual words written for Bumblebee which were later replaced with sound effects. When Bumblebee regains his voice, it's provided by actor Will Friedle.\n\nBumblebee appears in the pilot episode of the series responding too late to a call for help from Cliffjumper, who is captured by the Decepticons and killed. Bumblebee soon is assigned to be Raf Esquivel's guardian, having grown close to the boy as he understands his language of beeps. In the \"Operation: Bumblebee\" two-parter, Bumblebee lost his transformation cog and its ability to have him transform before eventually retrieving the cog from human terrorist group M.E.C.H. and Starscream.\n\nBumblebee's goal in the series is to be promoted to warrior class, as he first states in \"Masters & Students\". Optimus does not believe him to be worthy of promotion at such a young age. Nevertheless, Bumblebee shows he is still a capable warrior, since he is able to fight the likes of Breakdown and Shockwave. When questioned by Smokescreen in \"Project Predacon\", Bumblebee admits he is holding back so that he can one day be promoted to warrior class on Cybertron.\n\nIn \"Deadlock\", during the final battle aboard the \"Nemesis\", Bumblebee tries to give Optimus Prime the Star Saber for him to fight Megatron, but is killed by the Decepticon. However, Bumblebee fell into the ship's Omega Lock and exposure to the Synthetic Energon powering it both revived him and restored his voice. As Megatron prepared to finish Optimus, Bumblebee used the Star Saber to stab him in his spark, killing him. Afterwards, once the Omega Lock restored Cybertron, Bumblebee gives Raf a goodbye before leaving for his home world where he is finally promoted to warrior class during the series finale \"Predacons Rising\". However, things quickly turn for the worse when Unicron appears on Cybertron in Megatron's body, and two new Predacons are cloned by Shockwave. With Optimus on a mission to retrieve the AllSpark, and Ultra Magnus having been severely wounded by the new Predacons, Bumblebee becomes Autobot leader at Ratchet's encouragement as he leads them, the newly defected Knock Out and the three Predacons in making a stand against Unicron's undead Predacon army at the Well of All Sparks, buying enough time for Optimus to return to defeat Unicron. Optimus reveals that he must sacrifice himself to restore the AllSpark to Cybertron's core, and does not pass on leadership to any one person present, stating that leadership will now be earned through actions. Bumblebee promises to keep the peace on Cybertron to Optimus, implying Bumblebee to be the new leader of the Autobots, and by extension, Cybertron's new age.\n\nBumblebee appears as the main protagonist of the sequel series \"\", with Will Friedle reprising his role. In the series, Bumblebee is called to Earth when a new generation of Decepticons re-emerges on the planet. After receiving a vision from Optimus Prime, Bumblebee travels to Earth via a spacebridge and discovers that a ship full of Decepticon criminals has crashed on Earth and its inmates have escaped. Initially believing that Optimus' mission is intended for him alone, Bumblebee ends up with a team of ragtag Autobots, including a rebel bad boy bot named Sideswipe, a hyper active Mini-Con named Fixit, the bombastic ex-Decepticon and Dinobot Grimlock, and a female Elite Guard cadet named Strongarm, in order to combat the Decepticons. After befriending humans Denny Clay and his son Russell and fighting the Chompazoid Underbite, the group is greeted by the inexplicably corporeal Optimus. Unable to explain his return, Optimus expresses his confidence in Bumblebee and his new team before departing.\n\nWhile leading the team, to recapture the escaped Decipticons, they come across Steeljaw, an escaped convict who has his own plan to lead the other escaped convicts. The Autobots would later receive a visit from Bumblebee's old comrade Jazz, who informed Bumblebee that his actions in departing Cybertron had angered the high council. After helping apprehend a fugitive named Ped, Jazz volunteered to return to Cybertron and inform the council of what had taken place. The team then received another group of Cybertronian visitors, in the form of Autobot bounty hunter Drift, Decepticon bounty hunter Fracture, and their Mini-Con teammates. Both Cybertronians arrived to collect a bounty placed on Bumblebee by the High Council for his actions, but Drift was convinced of Bumblebee's nobility after Bee saved his life. The team managed to defeat Fracture, and though his ship was lost they gained the use of his ground bridge.\n\nAfter all of them but Grimlock and Fixit were given Decepticon Hunters, Bee and his team would then be forced to deal with Steeljaw's gang again—now including Thunderhoof, Underbite, and Fracture and his Mini-Cons—as both pursued the Decepticon fugitive Clampdown. Bee's team managed to capture all the Decepticons, but were forced to let them escape when Steeljaw broke free and set an unmanned garbage barge loose in the path of a riverboat.\n\nDrift and his Mini-Cons would later return to Earth and subsequently join the team. The team continued to capture escaped convicts. Bumblebee was once again contacted by Optimus with further warnings, shortly before Steeljaw and his pack managed to briefly seize the scrapyard; however, the Autobots managed to recover their base. The team soon gained another new ally in the form of the Primus-chosen female Autobot warrior Windblade, who aided the team in securing the fugitives Razorpaw and Zizza before departing.\n\nUnfortunately for Bumblebee and his team, the threat that Optimus had warned them of soon revealed itself as Megatronus, a disgraced member of the Thirteen. Having struck a deal with Steeljaw's pack, Megatronus instructed them to construct several devices he needed, which they did after capturing Strongarm, Sideswipe, and the returning Windblade. Bumblebee led the remainder of his team against them, only for Optimus arrive shortly before Megatronus made his appearance. Deferring to his former commander, Bumblebee became more concerned with Optimus' well-being and leadership than trusting in his own previous experiences. Fortunately, his team rallied behind him and gave him the courage to stand firm, which enabled them to capture Steeljaw's Pack after the would-be Decepticon tyrant was ejected from the battle by Megatronus. The Autobots then fought to prevent Megatronus from destroying both Earth and Cybertron, and managed it after discovering the latent powers of Bumblebee, Sideswipe, and Strongarm's Decepticon Hunters used in tandem and copying the sword form of Optimus' Prime Decepticon Hunter. With Megatronus defeated and possibly eliminated, the Autobots departed for home, with Bumblebee at last finding his rallying cry: \"Rev up and roll out!\"\n\nWith Megatronus defeated and most of the Pack apprehended, Bumblebee questioned whether his fellow Autobots wished to remain with him on Earth. To a one they agreed, with Windblade and Optimus formally joining the team, though Optimus did so as Bumblebee's equal rather than his superior. Turning their attention to Decepticon fugitives still scattered around the globe, Bumblebee decided to split his team by dispatching Drift, his Mini-Cons, and Windblade to seek out Decepticons in other locations while the rest of the team remained at the scrapyard. At their own insistence Optimus and Sideswipe joined the team, which ended up stranded in the Arctic after Optimus' altered state damaged their Groundbridge. Unfortunately, the remainder of the team soon had to deal with another problem: Overload, a Decepticon who had previously infiltrated the Autobot ranks and caused Bumblebee to suffer serious injuries, greatly embittering the former scout.\n\nBumblebee became consumed with bringing Overload in, even after the Mini-Con fugitives Backtrack and Ransack were freed during their initial battle; the two Mini-Cons subsequently joined forces with Overload. Bee would continue to carry out his missions, though once he gained the ability to combine with his teammates, He became edgier on ethics during the Stunticon battles. He eventually realized that he tweaked a perfect formula for the worst, and resumed his usual command style for the rest of the show.\n\nBumblebee appears in the episode \"Bumblebee to the Rescue\", where he helps the Rescue Bots and their human partners investigate a fallen meteor. Optimus Prime briefly assigns Bumblebee to observe how the Rescue Bots and the Burns family work together. Cody and the rest of the Burns family are unable to understand Bumblebee and requires one of the Rescue Bots to translate. The Rescue Bot Blades also happens to be a big fan of Bumblebee (who is said to be a legendary scout and war hero by the Rescue Bots). When Heatwave, Boulder, and Chase are infected by a substance contained in the meteor, Bumblebee, Blades, and the Burns family work together to destroy the meteor and obtain a sample in a hope to find a cure. Bumblebee and Blades successfully destroy the meteor and retrieve the sample, but at the cost of being infected as well, but thankfully the Burnses use an analysis of the meteor sample Bumblebee found, They are able to find a cure in the Autobots database, curing Bumblebee and the Rescue Bots. At the end of the episode, Cody is revealed to have learned how to understand Bumblebee. Before leaving, Bumblebee asks the Burnses (with Cody acting as interpreter) if they can take a picture of him and Blades.\n\nBumblebee returns with Optimus Prime in \"It's a Bot Time\" and \"Bots to the Future\", where they go back in time to save the Rescue Bots from Dr. Morocco. They return to an alternate present with Dr. Morocco ruling Griffin Rock. They fight Morbots, while the Rescue Bots go into the city. They find out they left Dilther behind, which is how the Morbot army exists. They go back in time to take him back to the present, which is then changed back to the regular timeline. Bumblebee later returned in \"Odd Bot Out\", where he was sent to search for a missing Cybertronian artifact on Griffin Rock while Optimus searched the nearby seafloor. To the dismay of his biggest fan Blades, Bumblebee teamed up with Dani, who was temporarily unable to pilot Blades due to her pilot's license expiring.\n\nHe returned in the season 4 episode \"Uninvited Guest\", making a crash landing at the training center and helping contain a stowaway Energon Eater. Will Friedle reprised his role for the final time here, co-starring with his best friend Jason Marsden.\n\n\"Rescue Bots Academy\" saw Bumblebee receive multiple mentions and pictorial cameos, until he was brought as a guest teacher in the episode \"Bee Prepared\", to the excitement of all the recruits, especially Wedge. Friedle had been dropped as Bumblebee's voice actor for the series, having been replaced by Jeremy Levy, who uses an identical voice used for \"Cyberverse\" Bumblebee.\n\nBumblebee is an Autobot warrior, and is based on the \"Generation 1\" version of the character.\n\nKreon Bumblebee appeared in the animated shorts \"Last Bot Standing\", \"Bot Stars\", \"My Ride is Better Than Your Ride\", \"The Big Race\", \"A Gift for Megatron\", \"Megatron's Revenge\", and \"Quest for Energon, Part 1\".\n\nKre-O Bumblebee appears in the flash video game \"Kre-O Transformers Konquest\". In this game Kreon Optimus Prime attempts to avoid bombs and collect parts to rebuild Kre-O Ratchet, Mirage, Prowl, and Bumblebee.\n\nIn the 10th installment of the Angry Birds series, Angry Birds Transformers Bumblebee appears. Here he is portrayed by Chuck (Better known as \"Yellow Bird\"). Bumblebee/Chuck will have two variations, one which is yellow with black stripes based on his pre-Age of Extinction look. And one that is based on his Age of Extinction appearance. Both resemble a Dodge Challenger in vehicle mode.\n\nBumblebee is one of the main characters of \"\" as well as the initial protagonist for seasons 1 and 2 before sharing the role with Optimus Prime, Cheetor for season 2 and Hot Rod for season 3's take on the Quintesson story arc.\n"}

The majority of services to/from the railway station use Class 333 electrified trains operated by Northern Trains, on the Airedale Line to Skipton, the Wharfedale Line to Ilkley and the Leeds-Bradford Line to Leeds.\n\nThe other main railway station in the city is Bradford Interchange, about 10 minutes on foot from Forster Square, from where services operate along the Caldervale Line to Leeds, Halifax, Huddersfield, Manchester Victoria, Blackpool and London King's Cross. Bradford Interchange is situated at a higher level, across the city centre, than Forster Square. The Bradford Crossrail proposal to link the two stations is currently viewed as unlikely to proceed.\n\nThe first rail service into Bradford was opened by the Leeds and Bradford Railway on 1 July 1846. The line approached the town from the north, up Bradford Dale from Shipley, and terminated at a railway station on Kirkgate, opposite the end of Market Street. There were hourly services to Leeds Wellington Station, and through trains to London Euston via Derby and Rugby.\n\nThe first railway station building was an imposing neoclassical building designed by William Andrews. By 1853, the Midland Railway had acquired the Leeds and Bradford, and rebuilt the station. The new building was larger, but less interesting architecturally.\n\nIn 1890, the railway station was again replaced. The Midland Railway's architect Charles Trubshaw designed a large complex containing the passenger station, goods station and the Midland Hotel. The station had six platforms and an overall glazed roof of the ridge and furrow pattern. The [train shed] roof was dismantled in the 1960s and replaced with utilitarian 'butterfly' awnings. The station was also used by the North Eastern Railway. The station began to be called \"Market Street Station\" at this time, but local maps and directories do not confirm this (see Station name below).\n\nBy 1906, Forster Square had been built just south-east of the railway station, but the name \"Forster Square Station\" was not used until 1924.\n\nIn March 1963, the Beeching Report recommended the closure of all railways serving Wharfedale, and the removal of several services out of Forster Square. As a consequence, many railway stations closed in 1965, and local services to Leeds ceased. However, the decision to close was deferred for some of the lines. In 1972, Bradford Corporation (now City of Bradford Metropolitan District Council), together with several other local authorities in the area, determined to subsidise the Wharfedale and Airedale lines. The lines have remained open, and in the ensuing years, a number of stations have been reopened. From April 1974, the new West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive (now known as Metro) took responsibility for those services.\n\nForster Square Station was truncated in 1990, when a new station was built on the western side of the former station. The new station has three platforms, two of which (platforms 1 & 2) are able to accommodate intercity trains. The old station was later demolished and a shopping centre called 'Broadgate' was scheduled to be constructed on the site. That development was cancelled because of the early 1990s recession, and the area was used as a car park, but a new tax office was later built there. Part of the screen arcade that fronted the 1890 station, as well as the Midland Hotel, remains. In 2005, these became much more visible, when the city centre redevelopment began and Forster House was demolished.\n\nThe line into Forster Square was electrified in 1994, as part of the electrification of the Airedale Line and Wharfedale Line, which allowed through electric trains to London via the newly-electrified East Coast Main Line. More recently, the pedestrian approach from Cheapside has been redeveloped, and ticket barriers installed.\n\nHistorically, services have been as follows:\n\nThere is some disagreement about what names were used and when. Most modern references state that at least one of them was called 'Market Street', but there is disagreement as to exactly when this name was in use:\n\n\nHowever, contemporary sources do not seem to use the name. The \"Bradford Post Office Directory\" says that the Midland terminal is at \"Station, bottom of Kirkgate\" (1856, 1863, 1898) or \"Station, Forster Square\" (1916, 1927); only in 1928 did a directory use the name \"Forster Square Station\". (In contrast, from 1879/80 onward the directories show the other terminal as \"Exchange Station, Drake St\"). Neither the map by Dixon & Hindle nor the 1906 OS map gives a name for the station other than 'Midland Station', but the latter names 'Exchange Station'.\n\nIt seems likely that the original station was called simply 'Bradford', at least until the Lancashire & Yorkshire station opened, at Drake Street in 1850. After then, it would have been the Midland Station. Later, it apparently came to be called 'Bradford Market Street', but that does not appear to have been official. Bradshaw's July 1922 Railway Guide, in a timetable footnote, refers to Market Street and gives the distance to Exchange Station.\n\nTrains from Bradford Forster Square are operated by Northern Trains and London North Eastern Railway. Most trains are run by Northern; these are towards Leeds (on the Leeds-Bradford Line), (on the Airedale Line) and (on the Wharfedale Line). During Monday to Saturday daytimes, trains operate every 30 minutes on each route. On weekday and Saturday evenings there are trains every hour to each of Skipton and Ilkley, but no trains run through to Leeds; instead a shuttle service runs between Bradford and Shipley, connecting there with Skipton – Leeds trains. Connections are also available at Shipley for longer distance trains to and , although direct services to both destinations sometimes operate if the Leeds route is closed for engineering work.\n\nOn Sundays, trains run hourly between Bradford and Leeds all day (until the end of service) and to both Skipton and Ilkley. The latter two routes were upgraded from two-hourly frequencies at the December 2017 timetable change.\n\nDuring off-peak hours most trains use platforms 1 (for Skipton) and 2 (Leeds and Ilkley) – platform 3 is mainly used during weekday peak periods and in the evening, though a spare set is usually stabled here between 09.00 and 16.00 each weekday.\n\nLondon North Eastern Railway operate one service each way per day via Leeds and the East Coast Main Line to London King's Cross.\n\n"}
{"id": "1896117", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896117", "title": "DSCAM", "text": "DSCAM\n\nDSCAM and Dscam are both abbreviations for Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule. In humans, DSCAM refers to a gene that encodes one of several protein isoforms.\n\nDown syndrome (DS), caused by trisomy 21, is the most common birth defect associated with intellectual disability. DSCAM plays a crucial role in the development of DS: it is expressed in the developing nervous system, with the highest level of expression occurring in the fetal brain. When over-expressed in the developing fetal central nervous system, it leads to Down syndrome.\n\nA homologue of the \"Dscam\" protein in \"Drosophila melanogaster\" has 38,016 isoforms arising from four variable exon clusters (12, 48, 33 and 2 alternatives, respectively). By comparison, the entire \"Drosophila melanogaster\" genome only has 15,016 genes. The diversity of isoforms from alternative splicing of the Dscam1 gene in \"D. melanogaster\" allows every neuron in the fly to display a unique set of \"Dscam\" proteins on its cell surface. \"Dscam\" interaction stimulates self-avoidance mechanisms that are essential for normal neural circuit development.\n\nThe DSCAM protein structure is conserved, with roughly more than 20% amino acid identity across the deuterostomes and protostomes, and assuming an ancestral homologous gene, places the origin of the DSCAM gene at >600 million years ago. Since then, the DSCAM gene has been duplicated at least once in vertebrates and insects.\n\nDSCAM was first identified in an effort to characterize proteins located within human chromosome band 21q22, a region known to play a critical role in Down syndrome. The name Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule was chosen for a combination of reasons including: 1) chromosomal location, 2) its appropriate (normal) expression in developing neural tissue, and 3) its structure as an Ig receptor related to other cell adhesion molecules (CAMs).\n\nThe DSCAM gene has been identified in the DS critical region. \"Dscam\" is predicted to be a transmembrane protein and a member of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily of cell adhesion molecules. It is expressed in the developing nervous system with the highest level of expression occurring in the fetal brain. When this gene is over-expressed in the developing fetal central nervous system, it leads to Down syndrome. Diverse glycoproteins of cell surfaces and extracellular matrices, operationally termed as 'adhesion molecules' are important in the specification of cell interactions during development as well as maintenance and regeneration of the nervous system.\n\nAnother DSCAM-like gene, DSCAML1, is located on chromosome band 11q23, a locus associated with Gilles de la Tourette and Jacobsen syndromes.\n\nSome intriguing changes in the gene structure of DSCAM have occurred in arthropods where several duplications of exons generated three large tandem arrays that are alternatively spliced. This alternative splicing of individual exon sequences within an array occurs in a mutually exclusive and combinatorial manner allowing for expression of tens of thousands of Dscam isoforms. In the arthropods' genomes these three large exon arrays encode the N-terminal halves of the second and third Ig domains and the full Ig7 domain. The different structures of these isoforms lead to differences in binding interactions. Crystal structures of two \"D. melanogaster\" isoforms (with the first four Ig domains only), D9.9 and D1.34 () shows large variations in their binding epitopes and dimerization interface and conformations. Much of the difference is found the Ig3 domain loop.\n\nComparing the homology between genes and their products, is fundamental in understanding the phylogenetic relationship across the evolutionary pathway. In addition to the thousands of isoforms that can be populated from a single DSCAM of one species, DSCAM also demonstrates a diverse array of homology across species. Below are the genes, mRNA transcripts, and proteins identified as homologs of Down syndrome adhesion molecule.\nLike many neuronal receptors, Dscam proteins have multiple functions, with repulsive and attractive roles that are dependent on the type of ligand that they interact with.\n\nInvertebrates do not have antibody-based immune systems. Instead, invertebrates rely on their innate immune system to eliminate infectious entities. The task of detecting and responding to a diverse pool of infectious agents are accomplished by germline encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which detect different patterns associated with the molecular markers to initiate an immune response. The role of Dscam in the fly immune response was demonstrated by an RNAi mediated depletion experiment of DSCAM in which it was found to be associated with the cells that play a role in the fly's immune system.\n\nDscam is found to have a role in phagocytosis in insects. The splicing pattern of the gene accompanying the phagocytic activity is specific to the type of infectious pathogen. In mosquitoes, the silencing of the Anopheles gambiae Dscam (AgDscam) disables its capacity to fight Plasmodium. The specificity of the Dscam recognition mechanism allows the mosquitoes of this species to differentiate the infection between bacteria and Plasmodium, and between Plasmodium berghei and Plasmodium falciparum.\n\nSelf-avoidance is a mechanism where the neuronal processes from the cell repel each other during arborization and axon branching to avoid fasciculation and clumping. Self-avoidance is necessary to prevent extensive overlapping in the arborization pattern and to facilitate the coverage of the neuronal processes across different regions of the nervous system during development.\n\nDSCAM is recognized to be involved in this process in both vertebrates and invertebrates during neural development. Cell aggregation assays show that cell adhesion molecules, such as DSCAM, belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily bind homophilically and specifically. These molecules also appear to have a role in chemoattraction and repulsion.\n\nDscam1, of \"drosophila\", may be one of the molecules involved in counteracting the netrin-dependent chemoattraction between neuronal processes during the neural development stage. As previously mentioned, the Dscam1 gene in \"drosophila\" can encode 19008 extracellular domains, which bind homophilically and with isoform specificity. The isoform-specific binding properties of Dscam, during homophilic repulsion, are the basis of self-avoidance, which is a crucial developmental mechanism for uniform distribution of axonal and dendritic processes in the formation of synaptic fields. The neurons express a stochastic array of Dscam1 isoforms on their cell surface. Cells that have the same isoform patterns displaced on their surface, recognize the other as 'self', which leads to self-avoidance with the processes of neurons of the same subtype homophilically repelling from each other.\n\nIn addition to homophilic repulsion, Dscam1 mediates repulsion between neurites of different subtypes based on the specific isoform patterns displayed on the cell surface. This is called cell-type specific avoidance. The photoreceptor terminals of Drosophila form synapses with the postsynaptic invariant (tetrad) synapses that connect a pair of postsynaptic elements. Dscam is thought to aid this process by regulating the synaptic specificity through exclusion of inappropriate synaptic combination at the contact site.\n\nFurthermore, DSCAM is thought to have a role in 'tiling' during the drosophila's neuronal development. Tiling is a mechanism in which the processes from cells that share the same function work to create nerve bundles in a defined territory to create a pattern of non-overlapping dendritic or axonal fields. Dscam1 and Dscam2 appear to be involved in axonal branching and tiling in Drosophila. Tiling occurs when homophilic repulsion mediated by Dscam2 prevents the processes of the same class of cells from overlapping. While both Dscam1 and Dscam2 mediate homophilic repulsion, the Dscam2 gene (unlike Dscam1) only encodes two alternative isoforms and thus lacks possible molecular diversity. Consequently, the role of Dscam2, in either self-avoidance or cell-type-specific avoidance, occurs depending on which isoform or ratio of isoforms that the neuron expresses.\n\nMany Ig superfamily molecules bind homophilically and heterophilically, and Dscam/DSCAM proteins are no exception. Vertebrate DSCAMs and DSCAML1s have not only been shown to bind homophilically (i.e., DSCAM–DSCAM or DSCAML1–DSCAML1, and not DSCAM–DSCAML1), but also have cell-type specific, mutually exclusive, expression patterns. Due to the combinatorial use of alternative exons, the homophilic binding specificity of Drosophila Dscam is amplified to tens of thousands of potential homodimers., Biochemical assays (cell-to-cell and bead-to-cell binding assays) were used to demonstrate that isoform-specific homodimerization occurs with remarkable binding specificity. This reveals that Dscam diversity can give rise to >18,000 distinct homodimers.\n\nThe role of Ig-CAMs in human development and disease is only beginning to be elucidated. This may be of particular interest with respect to the DSCAMs, as DSCAM maps to chromosome 21 in a region critical for the neurocognitive and other defects of Down syndrome and DSCAML1 maps to chromosome 11 in a region whose deletion is associated with 11q deletion syndrome. This gives rise to neurocognitive defects and a subset of other defects which are similar to those seen in DS, including psychomotor retardation, Strabismus, Epicanthus, Telecanthus, carp-shaped upper lip, low-set dysmorphic ears, and cardiac defects. The level of DSCAM expression is increased by more than 20% in the DS brain. Given its identity as a potential neural morphogen and its expression in the cerebral and cerebellar cortices from the earliest stages in their development, it is not unreasonable to suggest that this level of DSCAM over-expression may contribute to the pre- and post-natal defects of DS, particularly, the cerebral and cerebellar hypoplasia and the abnormalities of the dendritic tree. Further, a role for DSCAM over-expression in contributing to the defects of cortical lamination seen in DS is supported by the fact that disruptions in other genes expressed by Cajal–Retzius cells, such as Reelin and LIS1, cause severe defects in neuroblast migration and cortical lamination.\n\nA study of congenital heart defect (CHD) investigated the polygenic effect of DSCAM with other genes. Under normal physiological conditions, DSCAM and COL6A2 work jointly in the drosophila to mediate cell matrix adhesion. However, over-expressing DSCAM and COL6A2 in the drosophila and mouse heart, resulted in a high mortality rate in addition to several serious heart defects, including atrial septal defects and cardiac hypertrophy. The interaction between DSCAM and COL6A2 and their combined effects were also observed in the H9c2 cardiac cell line with incidence of cardiac hypertrophy. While other gene combinations were screened to test the polygenic effect on the cardiac disorder, the DSCAM – COL6A2 pair was found to cause the most severe adverse effect in drosophila. Translating the result to human cases of heart defects in DS patients require more study due to species-specific variance in the gene expression level. Nonetheless, the finding that DSCAM exerts a synergistic effect on the cardiac disease progression, upon disrupted expression level, allows future research on its role in some other major diseases.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1896127", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896127", "title": "Popobawa", "text": "Popobawa\n\nPopobawa, also Popo Bawa, is the name of an evil spirit or shetani, which is believed by residents of Zanzibar to have first appeared on the Tanzanian island of Pemba. In 1995, it was the focus of a major outbreak of mass hysteria or panic which spread from Pemba to Unguja, the main island of the Zanzibar archipelago, and across to Dar es Salaam and other urban centres on the East African coast.\n\nPopobawa is a Swahili name which translates literally as \"bat-wing\" (from Swahili \"popo\", \"bat\", and \"bawa\", \"wing\"). This name is said to have originated as a description of the dark shadow cast by the spirit when it attacks at night: it does not refer to the actual form of the spirit, which is liable to change. Swahili speakers also use a plural form of the name - \"mapopobawa\" - to refer to multiple manifestations of the feared spirit. This plural is anglicized as \"Popobawas\".\n\nPopobawa is a shapeshifter and described as taking different forms, not just that of a bat as its name implies. It can take either human or animal form, and metamorphose from one into the other. Popobawa typically visits homesteads at night, but can also be seen in the daytime. It is sometimes associated with the presence of a sulfurous odor, but this is not always the case. Popobawa attacks men, women and children, and may attack all of the members of a household, before passing on to another house in the neighbourhood. Its nocturnal attacks can comprise simple physical assault and/or poltergeist-like phenomena; but most feared is sexual assault and the anal sodomising of men and women.\n\nVictims are often urged to tell others that they have been assaulted, and are threatened with repeat visits by Popobawa if they do not. During Popobawa panics many people try to guard against attack by spending the night awake outside of their houses, often huddled around an open fire with other family members and neighbours. Panics occur most often in Zanzibar, throughout the island of Pemba and in the north and west of Unguja island, including Zanzibar City. Episodes have also been reported in Dar es Salaam and other towns on the mainland coast of Tanzania.\n\nAs legendary creatures go, Popobawa is of fairly recent origin.\nSightings of the popobawa only go back about forty years; Parkin states that the first reports date back to 1965 on the island of Pemba, appearing shortly after that island's political revolution. Better-known sightings followed in 1970, and the creature resurfaced periodically in the 1980s, reaching a peak in 1995. Five years passed without a sighting, but the popobawa appeared briefly in 2000 and again in 2007.\n\nA popular origin story of Popobawa proposes that in the 1970s an angry sheikh released a Jinn to take vengeance on his neighbors. The sheikh lost control of the jinn, who took to demonic ways. It has been argued that because of Zanzibar's past as an Arab-run slave market, the story of Popobawa is an articulated social memory of the horrors of slavery (Parkin 2004). Many of the legends on Zanzibar came from the colonizers and traders of the past, including Arabs, Portuguese, Indians, Chinese, Britons, Persians and Africans.\n\nReports of Popobawa attacks rise and fall with the election cycle in Zanzibar, although victims argue Popobawa is apolitical. Popobawa reports rose dramatically relatively recently, in 1995. A further spate of attacks was reported in Dar es Salaam in 2007. One explanation put forth for the election cycle connection is the claim that the Popobawa is the vengeful ghost of the assassinated President Abeid Karume, or was summoned by the Chama Cha Mapinduzi political party.\n\nVillagers maintain that Popobawa becomes enraged if his existence is denied. Popobawa allegedly spoke to a group of villagers on Pemba in 1971 through a girl possessed by the monster. The girl, called Fatuma, spoke in a man's deep voice and then villagers say they heard the sound of a car revving and rustling on a nearby roof. Many of those on the islands believe in exorcisms, and place charms at the base of fig trees, or sacrifice goats.\n\nBenjamin Radford interviewed doctors at Zanzibar Medical Group (Zanzibar's main hospital) and none reported ever treating popobawa victims.\n\nAfter the incidents involving Popobawa in 1995 were reported an article was published in the \"Skeptical Inquirer\" by Joe Nickell regarding the phenomenon. In the article Nickell compared the experiences described of a visit from Popobawa with the symptoms of a waking dream, also known as sleep paralysis or a hypnopompic or hypnogogic hallucination. Nickell went on to describe some of the symptoms of a waking dream as including \"a feeling of being weighted down or even paralyzed. Alternately, one may \"float\" or have an out-of-body experience. Other characteristics include extreme vividness of the dream and bizarre and/or terrifying content\". Nickell also compared these symptoms with those experienced by people who claim to have been attacked by incubi, succubi or Hags from western folklore, and in more modern cases, with alien abductions. A book released in 2017 entitled \"Popobawa: Tanzanian Talk, Global Misreadings\" by Katrina Daly Thompson was critical of Nickell, claiming that he was \"associating Zanzibaris with fear and Westerners with skepticism\". Nickell responded that he agrees \"Westerners should be wary of imposing simplistic patterns on another culture, but they also should not shy away from making scientific observations where appropriate\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1896135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896135", "title": "Yearly Meeting", "text": "Yearly Meeting\n\nYearly Meeting is a term used by members of the Religious Society of Friends, or Quakers, to refer to an organization composed of constituent meetings or churches within a geographical area. The constituent meetings are called Monthly Meetings in most of the world; in England, local congregations are now called Area Meetings, in Australia Monthly Meetings are called Local Meetings. \"Monthly\" and \"Yearly\" refer to how often the body meets to make decisions. Monthly Meetings are local congregations which hold worship on Sunday. Depending on the Yearly Meeting organization, there may also be Quarterly Meetings, Half-Yearly Meetings, or Regional Meetings, where a number of local Monthly Meetings come together within a Yearly Meeting.\n\nThere are also parallel Yearly Meetings for young Quakers, Junior Yearly Meetings.\n\nYearly Meeting gatherings are times for Friends from a wide geographical area to come together to worship and to seek God's guidance on decisions and on issues facing Friends in that region. Yearly Meetings publish guiding principles, organizational processes, and collected expressions of faith of the constituent Friends. These publications are called \"Faith and Practice\", and/or Books of Discipline.\n\nLike many aspects of Quakerism, the organization into Yearly Meetings arose gradually. English Friends began to meet shortly after their beginning in a large group starting in the 1650s. The oldest Yearly Meeting in Britain, Britain Yearly Meeting (originally London Yearly Meeting), considers the year 1668 its official founding. New England Yearly Meeting dates its founding from 1661. In the early days the business of the meeting was to receive answers to the Yearly Meeting's queries to the Quarterly Meetings, to read epistles from traveling Friends, and to seek God's guidance on actions. They also proposed and planned the establishment of Quaker institutions, such as schools.\n\nAs the Religious Society of Friends grew and spread around the world, new Yearly Meetings were established. While often influenced by the activities of other Yearly Meetings, each of the Yearly Meetings is autonomous.\n\nA session of a Yearly Meeting, as with all Quaker business sessions, is considered a time of worship in dealing with matters of business. When a matter has been presented and explained, the Friends who are gathered wait in silence, listening to the leading of God's spirit within them. Those who feel led to do so share their insights, while the others listen. Eventually a \"sense of the meeting\" begins to emerge. The clerk of the meeting (a type of facilitator) or the Recording Clerk (a person who writes the minutes) tries to formulate a minute that reflects the sense of the meeting. More input may follow. When it is clear that there is agreement, the sense of the meeting is recorded in the minute. Some Friends at the meeting may have reservations about the matter but choose to defer to the others. Friends believe and hope that the minute is God's will on the matter. However, nothing is considered a permanent and inviolable law among Friends and every matter is open to future change.\n\nBefore the close of a yearly meeting, Friends write an epistle to communicate to other Friends world-wide. It is the custom to read out selections from epistles the Yearly Meeting has received from other Quaker bodies during yearly meeting sessions.\n\nAll Friends who are members of a constituent Meeting are members of the corresponding Yearly Meeting and may attend and participate on an equal basis—there is no hierarchy within the Religious Society of Friends. Many specific issues of concern to Quakers are dealt with by committees appointed by Yearly Meetings.\n\nYearly Meetings are named for where they meet: a nation (e.g., Canadian Yearly Meeting), a region within a nation (e.g., New England Yearly Meeting), a state (e.g. Indiana Yearly Meeting), or a large city that serves as a hub (e.g., Philadelphia Yearly Meeting). The entire name of a Yearly Meeting usually includes the words \"of the Religious Society of Friends\" (e.g., New York Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends) although some do not (e.g., Northern Yearly Meeting).\n\nMany Yearly Meetings are members of larger groups. In the United States and a few other countries the three main groups of Friends are Friends General Conference, Friends United Meeting, and Evangelical Friends International. A broader group that crosses theological, organizational, and national lines and encourages communication and cooperation of the different groups is Friends World Committee for Consultation.\n\nSee also Quakers in Kenya\n\nSee also Quakers in Latin America\n\n\n\n\nSee also Quakers in Europe\n\n"}
{"id": "1896138", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896138", "title": "History of rail transport in Denmark", "text": "History of rail transport in Denmark\n\nThe history of rail transport in Denmark began in 1847 with the opening of a railway line between Copenhagen and Roskilde. The Kiel-Altona line in Holstein was completed three years earlier, but the region was later lost to the German Confederation in the Second War of Schleswig.\n\nThe Danish national railway operator, DSB, was established in 1885. Until recently, DSB administered most aspects of rail operations in Denmark proper, but the politically decided privatization efforts during the 1990s, has resulted in several local lines and tasks being outsourced to a number of privately owned companies. The multinational company of Arriva, is currently among the largest of these, operating c. 17% of the Danish rail network.\n\nIn the 1830s, England and North Germany planned to construct a railway line between the cities of Hamburg and Lübeck to ease transport between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. The Copenhagen government frowned on this, as they wanted to retain waterway traffic through Øresund, but to preempt these efforts, the Danish government set up the first Danish railway commission in 1835 to establish the layout of a railway line through the Duchy of Holstein. Consequently, the railway between Altona and Kiel was opened by King Christian VIII on 18 September 1844. However, the Duchy of Holstein was only in personal union with Denmark, with the King of Denmark being Duke of Holstein, and as a result of the Second War of Schleswig, Holstein was ceded to the German Confederation in 1864. The railway line was not the first in what constituted Denmark at the time (as Holstein was part of the German Confederation), but it was nonetheless the first to be built under the Danish monarchy.\n\nIn 1840, technician Søren Hjorth and accountant Johan Christian Gustav Schram published the paper \"Jærnbane mellem Kjøbenhavn og Roeskilde\", in which they argued that a railway between Copenhagen and Roskilde would be profitable. However, there was no further interest in this project until 1841, when cooperation with Industriforeningen had been established. In 1843, after substantial financial recalculations, they applied for a concession to construct a railway from Copenhagen via Roskilde to a coastal town on West Zealand. This was granted about a year later, albeit not with the same level of governmental economic support as the Kiel-Altona line.\n\nOn 2 July 1844 \"Det Sjællandske Jernbaneselskab\" (The Railway Company of Zealand) was established with Hjorth and Schram among the board of directors. Amidst considerable resistance from landowners, trouble with unstable labour and excessive expenditures, the economic resources necessary to complete the line were provided, and the Copenhagen-Roskilde line was opened, as the first in Denmark, on 26 June 1847. English engineer William Radford led construction. Sharp Brothers and Company, in Manchester, England built the initial batch of locomotives, the first of which was named 'Odin'.\n\nFollowing ratification of the Danish Constitution in 1849, there was political will to improve trade routes to England and provide better connections between Copenhagen and the rest of the country. The primary means for this was to extend the Copenhagen-Roskilde line to Korsør, on the west coast of Zealand. During the 1850s, sufficient funding to extend the line to Korsør was secured, and the new segment was opened on 26 April 1856.\n\nBefore the First War of Schleswig, plans had been made in Schleswig to construct a railway from Flensburg, via Husum, to Tönning to limit German influence on trade. However, these plans were hampered by the war and the new political system. In 1852, the construction company Peto, Brassey and Betts (represented in Scandinavia by Samuel Morton Peto) was granted concession to build the line, which opened on 6 October 1854. The railway was very successful, carrying English transit goods until 1857, when the Øresund toll was abolished.\n\nThe first railway lines on Zealand was constructed by the privately owned company of \"Det Sjællandske Jernbaneselskab\" DSJ (lit.: \"The Zealandic Railway Company\"), until it was taken over by the state in 1880. This ownership change was not without issues, and in several cases DSJ refused to build additional lines or make necessary upgrades, without financial guaranties. The last lines to be built by DSJ was “Nordvestbanen” (lit.: \"The Northwest Line\") connecting Roskilde, Holbæk and Kalundborg, and “Sydbanen” (lit.: \"The South Line\") connecting Roskilde, Køge, Næstved, Vordingborg and Nykøbing Falster. The last parts of the line on the island of Falster, was sold almost as soon as it opened for traffic.\n\nIn Jutland and on Funen, the state decided on a somewhat different approach to build the railways. Here the state financed and owned the lines and infrastructure right from the start, whilst trusting the daily administration of lines and trains to the private company of “Det danske Jernbanedriftsselskab” (lit.: \"The Danish Railway Operations Company\"). In 1862, the first line in Jutland was inaugurated, connecting the towns of Aarhus and Randers. Other lines criss-crossing Jutland north-south and east-west - including the island of Funen -, soon followed. The last railways to be laid, before major changes were made, connected the north–south mainline on the east coast known as “Den Østjydske Længdebane” (lit.: \"The East Jutlandic Longitude Line\") and the north-south mainline on the west coast known as \"Den Vestjydske Længdebane\" (lit.: \"The West Jutlandic Longitude Line\"). The line connected the towns of Lunderskov and the new port of Esbjerg specifically.\n\nBy 1880, all major railway lines and companies in Denmark proper, had been bought up by the company of “De Jydsk-Fynske Statsbaner” (lit.: \"the Jutlandic – Fuenic State Railways\") owned by the state and the company of “De Sjællandske Statsbaner” on private hands. In 1885 these two companies merged to form the state owned company of “De Danske Statsbaner” (it.: \"the Danish State Railways\") also known as DSB.\n\n\n\n"}

The styling remained almost unchanged: on both body styles differences were limited to vents moved from behind the front wheels to the bonnet.\n\nLike all 365s, the GTC and GTS were powered by a 4,390 cc \"Colombo\" V12 engine, specifically its \"Tipo 245/C\" variant. Fed by three twin-choke Weber 40 DFI carburettors, it produced at 6,600 rpm.\nIntegrating the gearbox with the final drive gave these cars a balanced 50:50 weight distribution.

South and west of this roundabout is an area of green belt land, crossed by Pymmes Brook and leading down to New Southgate Cemetery; an adjacent road, Whitehouse Way, provided the backdrop to scenes from Mike Leigh’s film \"Secrets and Lies\".\n\nThe name is Anglo-Saxon, possibly meaning 'hedge belonging to someone named Osa' or deriving from 'hawe's ege' referring to the Old English 'hawe' and the boundary of the Southaw wood. It was first recorded in 1176, in a charter from Henry II to the Abbot of St Albans referring to the abbot's woodland property there. The area was variously named as Huzeog, Hossegge, Huzeseg, Hwzeseg, Ousage, Ouzage, Owsage and Ussage. The land was sold after the Dissolution of the Monasteries and a large house was built and parkland laid out. A condition of tenure was that the woods should supply faggots for the burning of heretics. In 1614 the estate passed by marriage to Robert Berkeley, and in 1652 the house became the residence of four generations of the Hadley family. Following the death of John Hadley in 1744 the house was demolished and the estate sold. A new Osidge House was built by 1808 and later occupied by the Lambert and Bosanquet families, being purchased by David Bevan for his eldest child Louisa Bosanquet. After her death the estate was rented and later purchased by Thomas Lipton.\n\nThe 1868-1883 ordnance survey map of Middlesex shows Osidge as a small rural estate centred around the manor house, adjacent to Chase Side and Blind Lane (now Osidge Lane). Across the county line within the parish of East Barnet, in the Hundred of St Albans/Hertfordshire, Osidge fell under East Barnet Valley Urban District in 1863, renamed East Barnet Urban District in 1935. The area remained rural well into the twentieth century with only a small number of dwellings on its borders until suburbanisation in the early 1930s. Osidge was given formal status as an electoral ward covering an expanded area bounded by Pymmes Brook, Oakhill and the Southgate border, and in 1965 the district was transferred from Hertfordshire to the London Borough of Barnet. Osidge was one of several Barnet wards abolished for the 1968 local election, becoming part of the expanded Brunswick Park ward.\n\n\nOsidge is served by Hampden Way Nursery, Osidge Primary and Ashmole Academy - as well as the nearby East Barnet Day Nursery and Monkfrith and Brunswick Park primary schools. Osidge Primary School made the news in 2005 when chef François Nouaillat, horrified by the quality of the school meals given to his sons, took over the school kitchen.\nOsidge also has a library, situated on the border with Brunswick Park.\nThe 5th East Barnet Scout Group are based on Osidge Lane. Adjacent to the scouts hut is the Veterans Hall, which was home to the Monkfrith Boys Club, operational between 1964 and 2003. The Club hosted live music in the 1980s-1990s, including the debut performance of Barnet band Omega Tribe in 1981.\n\nOsidge is served by three C of E parish churches just outside the district: the northern part by St Mary the Virgin, East Barnet, Diocese of St Albans, and the central and southern parts by St Andrew's Southgate and Christ Church, Southgate Green, both Diocese of London.\nThe Christian Communion International has a church on Osidge Lane, in the former Veterans Hall.\n\nOsidge is not seen as a separate locality by most local residents but is regarded as part of Southgate; addresses are occasionally given as Osidge, Southgate. This is technically incorrect, as the area lies outside the pre-1965 Borough of Southgate and the current parliamentary constituency of Enfield Southgate. There are several probable reasons for this confusion. Firstly, they are largely in the same postal district, N14 (although so too is Oakwood, and the northern part of Osidge is in the EN4 district). Secondly, Osidge is close to Southgate tube station and to Southgate's main commercial hub on Chase Side. In addition, Osidge House - for centuries the most prominent dwelling in the district - has main access from Chase Side, a road forming the border of Edmonton Hundred, Middlesex, with Southgate its nearest village. St Andrew's Southgate is the closest parish church to Osidge House, and its origins are as a chapel-of-ease to Christ Church, Southgate; in 1902, The London Gazette reported on the granting of a Baronetcy to Thomas Lipton, the first and only 'Baronet of Osidge' giving his address as \"Osidge, in the parish of Southgate.\" The history of Osidge has therefore been covered by local historians of the Southgate area, while being recorded officially in histories of East Barnet.\n\nDespite this association, a 1992 Boundary Commission Report rejected proposals to incorporate most of the Osidge area into Enfield borough, partly on grounds of objections from Barnet council, local schools and residents that \"the Osidge community identified itself with Barnet\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1896179", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896179", "title": "Stan Lane", "text": "Stan Lane\n\nWallace Stanfield \"Stan\" Lane (born August 5, 1953) is an American retired professional wrestler and color commentator. He is best known for his appearances with the Continental Wrestling Association (CWA), Jim Crockett Promotions and World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in the 1980s. Primarily a tag team wrestler, Lane held championships including the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship, NWA United States Tag Team Championship, NWA World Tag Team Championship, and SMW Tag Team Championship as part of The Fabulous Ones, The Midnight Express, and The Heavenly Bodies.\n\nLane was trained by Ric Flair, debuting in 1978. He initially wrestled primarily for Championship Wrestling from Florida.\n\nIn 1982, Stan Lane went to Mid-South Wrestling and formed a team called The Fabulous Ones with Steve Keirn. The team feuded with The Midnight Express, Jerry Lawler & Bill Dundee, The Sheepherders (Butch Miller & Luke Williams), Randy Savage & Leapin' Lanny Poffo and The Moondogs with whom they had a series of exceptionally bloody matches. They were also pioneers in the \"MTV style\" of promotion, creating promotional videos and spectacular entrances with their popular theme song \"Everybody Wants You\" by Billy Squier. The Fabulous Ones was actually started in Memphis by Jerry Jarrett & Jackie Fargo.\n\nIn December 1990, to fans' excitement, he reformed the Fabulous Ones with Keirn briefly in the United States Wrestling Association (USWA), with Cornette as their manager. On January 7, 1991, they won the USWA Tag Team titles, defeating Tony Anthony and Doug Gilbert. Three weeks later, on January 28, after a controversial match with Jeff Jarrett and Jerry Lawler, the titles were held up; a week later, on February 4, the rematch for the held-up titles was held and they lost the match and the titles to Lawler and Jarrett.\n\nIn early 1987, Dennis Condrey left Jim Crockett Promotions abruptly, leaving former partner Bobby Eaton & manager Jim Cornette as a tag-team with only one member. Enter a man that Eaton was very familiar with and who was no stranger to tag-team wrestling, Stan Lane formerly of \"the Fabulous Ones\"'. Lane and Eaton knew each other well from working against each other in the past and this showed as the new version of the Midnight Express jelled from the beginning. Early on, \"Sweet\" Stan added a deep radio \"DJ voice\" for manager Jim Cornette that would enrage the crowd.\n\nIn May 1987 the combination of Eaton and Lane proved to be a golden one as they won the NWA US Tag-Team titles (a title they would win three times during their time together). A year later the team was cheered on to victory as the Midnight Express won the NWA World Tag-Team Titles from Four Horsemen members Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard \"(See also: Brain Busters)\" on September 10, 1988. This feat meant that they were the first tag-team to ever hold both the NWA World tag-team and NWA United States tag-team titles, a feat only the Steiner Brothers would go on to duplicate in 1991. The Express' run with the belts was a short one; they were defeated by The Road Warriors in a match that marked Hawk and Animal's first title reign.\n\nFrustrated by their inability to win the tag belts in previous years, the Warriors and manager Paul Ellering had decided to return to their roots as violent thugs who would do anything to win. This new attitude soon paid off with a title victory over Lane and Eaton. On October 29, 1988, the Midnights' reign came to a quick and violent end in New Orleans. At the beginning of the match, Ellering brutally attacked Express manager Jim Cornette outside the ring. When Lane jumped in, the Warriors battered and bloodied Eaton, leaving Lane to fight both Hawk and Animal essentially on his own. Eaton was eventually able to tag in, but was quickly overwhelmed by Animal and pinned after a vicious clothesline.\n\nNow the fan favorites the Midnight Express soon had to contend with a blast from the past, The Original Midnight Express as it consisted of Dennis Condrey and Randy Rose, who had teamed up before Condrey and Eaton became a team. During the November 5 episode of \"WCW Saturday Night\", Jim Cornette (kayfabe) received an anonymous phone call, as the caller ridiculed Cornette over Eaton and Lane's loss of the NWA World Tag Team Championship to The Road Warriors on October 29. Cornette recognized the caller and basically asked him to come say it to his face. At that point, Dangerously and the Original Midnight Express hit the ring and proceeded to pummel Cornette and Stan Lane, who was wrestling in a singles match. By the time Bobby Eaton showed up, it was three on one. Cornette showed up the next week on TBS carrying his blood stained suit jacket and the feud was on.\n\nThe teams wrestled at Starrcade '88, but nothing was solved. The Midnights vs. Midnights would be the hottest feud in WCW for months, building up to a six-man tag match involving the managers on pay-per-view in February 1989. The one who got pinned would have to leave the promotion. However, WCW (the former Jim Crockett Promotions) was under new ownership and in transition at the time and many wrestlers were coming and going. At the last minute, Condrey decided to leave WCW. Jack Victory was brought in as his replacement and the match went forward, but at this point no one really cared.\n\nDue to various booking issues, Jim Cornette and the Midnight Express left the promotion for a short while, around the time that Ted Turner brought out Jim Crockett and began promoting the federation as the National Wrestling Alliance / World Championship Wrestling. When the booking issues started to clear up, Cornette and the Midnight Express returned to the federation and a very strong tag-team division. One of those teams was The Dynamic Dudes (Shane Douglas and Johnny Ace), who admitted that the Midnight Express was one of their favorite teams and asked if Cornette would be their manager as well. Cornette agreed but the Midnight Express were not happy about it at all. After arguing, Jim Cornette stopped accompanying the Express to the ring, choosing to only manage the Dudes. At the Clash of Champions IX the two teams met with Jim Cornette in a neutral corner, forced to choose between the teams. The Express started out very aggressively, especially for a team that was supposed to be fan favorites and when the night was over the Midnight Express had once again established themselves as heels with Jim Cornette in their corner; Cornette had never stopped siding with the Express.\n\nAfter their heel turn, the Midnight Express started feuding with Flyin' Brian and \"Z-Man\" Tom Zenk over the recently re-activated US Tag-Team titles, winning the gold from the young team in early 1990. The Midnight Express would lose the titles to The Steiner Brothers three months later.\n\nAfter appearing at Halloween Havoc 1990, the Midnight Express split up when Cornette and Lane left the federation, due to conflicts with Jim Herd and booker Ole Anderson. For the first time in seven years there was no Midnight Express; it was the end of an era in tag-team wrestling.\n\nDuring 1991-1992, Lane competed in multiple independent wrestling organizations, including the Tri State Wrestling Alliance, the Global Wrestling Federation (GWF), the WWA, South Atlantic Pro Wrestling (SAPW), the AWF, the VWA, and the IWA. During his stay in the GWF he wrestled and lost to The Patriot in matches for the TV and North American heavyweight titles. During his stay in the AWF, Stan Lane competed against Paul Orndorff in the heavyweight title tournament, but lost in the final match, but Lane later won the title. Lane also held the tag team title with Jeff Collette in the VWA, and was managed by The Big Cheese during his time in the IWA.\n\nIn 1992, Lane and Cornette went to Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW), to form a new team called \"The Heavenly Bodies\" with Tom Prichard. They feuded with The Rock 'n' Roll Express and won the tag team titles 5 times, until he retired from the ring after losing a loser leaves town match and was replaced in the team by Jimmy Del Ray.\n\nLane retired in 1993 and went to work for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), as a member of the WWF's broadcast team. He began as a color commentator alongside Vince McMahon on \"WWF Superstars\". He then went on to become the host of \"WWF Wrestling Challenge\" in 1994, where he worked with Ted DiBiase and Gorilla Monsoon. Lane also did voiceover work of matches that were taped exclusively for Coliseum Video. He worked with DiBiase and Monsoon for those also. He also worked as a commentator in Ted DiBiase's promotion, WXO.\n\nLane left the WWF in late 1995 and retired. Lane returned in the late-1990s and again reformed \"The Fabulous Ones\" for a few cards in Bert Prentice's NWA Wildside promotion to wild fan reception. In 2004, Lane wrestled on several shows with Condrey and Eaton in the independent promotions in the Mid-Atlantic area. He retired from all wrestling in 2005.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1896197", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896197", "title": "The Blue Aeroplanes", "text": "The Blue Aeroplanes\n\nThe Blue Aeroplanes are an English rock band from Bristol, the mainstays of which have been Gerard Langley, brother John Langley, and dancer Wojtek Dmochowski. All three had previously been members of the new wave \"art band\" Art Objects from 1978 to 1981.\n\nThe Blue Aeroplanes first performed under that name at the King Street Art Gallery in Bristol in 1981. They consisted mainly of former members of Art Objects, with the addition of Nick Jacobs, former guitarist and vocalist of Southampton band the Exploding Seagulls. The same line-up played three or four concerts over the next couple of years, either at the gallery or for benefits, including a Karl Marx centenary performance at the Victoria Rooms, with the addition of trumpet and didgeridoo. The Blue Aeroplanes' first album \"Bop Art\" was released on their own Party Records in 1984, and was rapidly picked up by the Abstract (US) and Fire (UK) labels. It contained material that had been considered as a follow-up to Art Objects' only album, \"Bagpipe Music\". Gerard Langley's largely spoken poetic lyrics were combined with a heavily guitar-centric band that went on to release \"Tolerance\" (1985) and \"Spitting Out Miracles\" (1987) and several singles and EPs whose B-sides were brought together in the compilation \"FriendLoverPlane\" (1988), all on the Fire label.\n\nOn 24 February 1990, the band released their most critically acclaimed album, \"Swagger\", this time on a major label Chrysalis/Ensign. This was followed by \"Beatsongs\", which was recorded in the United States and released in 1991. It was produced by Elvis Costello and Larry Hirsch. This second album on the major label was their highest charting, reaching no. 33 in the UK Albums Chart. A second compilation of rare B-sides and out-takes, \"FriendLoverPlane2 (Up in a Down World)\", was released in 1992.\n\nThe follow-up to \"Beatsongs\" was delayed until 1994, when the album \"Life Model\" was released on the Beggars Banquet label; it was followed by \"Rough Music\" in 1995. \"Broken & Mended\" from \"Life Model\" was the band's last single to chart and is a favourite at gigs. A long break and another label change to ArtStar preceded the release of \"Cavaliers\" in 2000. Following negotiations with EMI who now owned the rights to \"Swagger\" and \"Beatsongs\", The Blue Aeroplanes made a surprise return to this major label. EMI re-released \"Swagger Deluxe\" as a 2-CD version in January 2006. This was followed by an album of new material called \"Altitude\" later that year, released on EMI's Harvest imprint. The group then recorded an album of cover versions of classic tracks that were originally recorded by artists signed to the Harvest label. The album, called \"Harvester\", was released by EMI/Harvest in 2007.\n\nAs well as the two FriendLoverPlane compilations, several other compilations have been released in recent years. \"Huh! The Best of The Blue Aeroplanes (1987–1992)\" was released by EMI/Chrysalis in 1997 and featured many of the songs from \"Swagger\" and \"Beatsongs\". Also in 1997, \"Warhol's 15 The Best of the Blue Aeroplanes (1985–1988)\" was released and covered the preceding period when the band was signed to Fire Records. In 1996 \"Fruit (live 1985–1995)\" was released on Fire Records and covered 10 years of live performances recorded at various venues. Then in 2001, ArtStar released \"Weird Sh*t\" which featured both rare tracks and alternative versions of some of the band's best-known songs from \"Swagger\" through to 'Cavaliers\".\n\nIn 2008 and 2009, limited-edition live albums were released and sold at the annual Christmas gig at Fiddlers in Bristol. \"Live in Cheltenham\" (2008) and \"Skyscrapers\" (2009) were limited to just 100 copies each and each featured songs not included on the other live CD. Their Christmas gig moved to The Fleece a few years later and is a staple in their touring calendar.\n\nThe band released a new album \"Welcome, Stranger!\" in January 2017 through Pledgemusic.\n\nThey have played headlining gigs in small indie venues as well as supporting big acts such as REM and Siouxsie & the Banshees on major international tours, frontman Gerard Langley always wearing his trademark shades even at night in dark venues. Performances include the band's 1992 appearance at Glastonbury which was broadcast on BBC Radio 1, the finale at the Hammersmith Apollo when 12 guitarists were seen on stage performing \"Breaking in My Heart\" and their annual appearance at Fiddlers in Bristol which has now been relocated to the band's own venue, The Fleece.\n\nIn February 2016 the band played at the 6music festival at Colston Hall's Lantern venue, being introduced by Gideon Coe and in April 2016 they were personally chosen by curator Stewart Lee to play the ATP festival at Pontins Prestatyn.\n\nIn 2019 the band performed at the Glastonbury Festival on the Avalon Stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1896219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896219", "title": "Russell Sage", "text": "Russell Sage\n\nRussell Sage (April 4, 1816 – July 22, 1906) was an American financier, railroad executive and Whig politician from New York. As a frequent partner of Jay Gould in various transactions, he amassed a fortune. Olivia Slocum Sage, his second wife, inherited his fortune, which was unrestricted for her use. In his name she used the money for philanthropic purposes, endowing a number of buildings and institutions to benefit women's education: she established the Russell Sage Foundation in 1907 and founded the Russell Sage College for women in 1916.\n\nSage was born at Verona in Oneida County, New York. He received a public school education and worked as a farm hand until he was 15. He started as an errand boy in his brother Henry's grocery in Troy, New York. He had a part interest in 1837–1839 in a retail grocery in Troy, and in a wholesale store there in 1839–1857.\n\nOn January 23, 1840, Sage married Marie-Henrie Winne, who was also known as \"Maria Winne\". They had no children. She died on May 7, 1867, of stomach cancer. In 1869 at the age of 53, Sage remarried, to Olivia Slocum (1828–1918), who was ten years younger.\n\nIn 1841 Sage was elected as alderman in Troy. He was re-elected to this office until 1848, while also serving for seven years as treasurer of Rensselaer County. He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives as a Whig, and served, with re-election as an Oppositionist, from March 4, 1853 until March 3, 1857. He served on the Ways and Means Committee. Sage was the first person to advocate in Congress for the purchase of George Washington's plantation, Mount Vernon, by the government.\n\nSubsequently, Sage settled in New York City, and engaged in the business of selling puts and calls and privileges on Wall Street.\n\nIn 1869, Sage was involved in a legal case concerning the usury laws in New York state, in which he was accused of being the leader of a usury group. He was convicted and fined $500, but his jail sentence was suspended. That year he remarried, to Olivia Slocum of Syracuse, New York.\n\nSage bought a seat on the New York Stock Exchange in 1874, and became known as a financier. At the same time he saw the future of railroads, and secured stocks in western roads, notably the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway. He was president and vice-president for twelve years. By selling such investments, as the smaller roads were bought by major trunk-lines, he became wealthy.\n\nIn his later years Sage was closely associated with Jay Gould in the management of the Wabash Railway, St. Louis and Pacific, Missouri Pacific Railroad, Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad, Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad and the St. Louis - San Francisco Railway, for which he was director of the corporations. He also served as director for the American cable company, the Western Union telegraph company, and the Manhattan consolidated system of elevated railroads in New York City.\n\nSage was also a director of the Union Pacific Railroad, which was part of constructing the transcontinental railroad. Together with other major investors (and railroad robber barons of the nineteenth century), he made a fortune. He was a director and vice-president in the Importers and Traders' National Bank for twenty years, and also a director in the Merchants' Trust Company and in the Fifth Avenue Bank of New York City.\n\nIn 1891, Henry L. Norcross entered Sage's office in a six-story 1859 brownstone office building at 71 Broadway in Manhattan, claiming he needed to discuss railroad bonds. Norcross gave Sage a letter demanding $1,200,000, which Sage declined to pay. Norcross was carrying a bag of dynamite, which exploded, killing Norcross, wounding Sage, and severely wounding William R. Laidlaw, Jr., a clerk for John Bloodgood and Co. who happened to be in the office. Afterward Laidlaw sued Sage, alleging that he had used him as a shield against Norcross. Disabled for life, Laidlaw aggressively pursued the lawsuits, winning $43,000 in damages after four trials, but a Court of Appeals reversed the award. Sage never paid any settlement and was publicly criticized as a miser because of his great fortune.\n\nSage was known to have affairs outside marriage both before and after the death of his first wife. The writer Paul Sarnoff suggested in his biography of Sage that he may have remarried for appearance's sake, and may never have consummated his second marriage. Sage was reported to have had a child by a young chambermaid.\n\nSage was a member of East Presbyterian Church on West 42nd Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenue, which later merged with Park Presbyterian to form West-Park Presbyterian.\n\nIn 1906 Sage died and left his entire fortune of about $70 million to his wife, Olivia Slocum Sage (1828–1918). He was buried in a mausoleum in Oakwood Cemetery in Troy, New York. The mausoleum is of a Greek style and is intentionally unnamed. To the left of the memorial is a bench which contains a relief of Medusa on the center of the back, complete with snakes as hair.\n\nOlivia Sage devoted a major portion of the money she inherited from her husband to philanthropy, including buildings and other memorials to him. She commissioned Ralph Adams Cram, a leading architect, to design Russell Sage Memorial Church, and for Louis Tiffany to create a large stained glass window as a memorial. Built in 1908, the church was located in Far Rockaway, Queens, where the family had a summer home.\n\nIn 1907 she established the Russell Sage Foundation, and in 1916 founded Russell Sage College in Troy. In addition she gave extensively to the Emma Willard School and to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy, her husband's home town.\n\nDuring World War II the Liberty ship was built in Panama City, Florida, and named in his honor.\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n\n\n"}

The absence of a paternal figures will be a constant in Amelio's future works.\n\nDuring his university studies of philosophy in Messina, Amelio got interested in cinema, writing as film critic for a local magazine. In 1965 he moved to Rome, where he worked as operator and assistant director for figures such as Liliana Cavani and Vittorio De Seta. He also worked for television, directing documentaries and advertisements.\n\nAmelio's first important work is the TV film \"La città del sole\", directed in 1973 for RAI TV and inspired to Tommaso Campanella's work. This was followed by \"Bertolucci secondo il cinema\" (1976) a documentary about \"1900\" shooting, and the thriller \"Effetti speciali\". Two years later he directed the mystery \"La morte al lavoro\", which won prizes at Locarno and Hyères festivals. \"The Little Archimedes\" (\"Il piccolo Archimede\") of 1979 was also critically acclaimed.\n\nIn 1982 he debuted for cinema proper with \"Blow to the Heart\" (\"Colpire al cuore\"), about Italian terrorism, presented at the Venice Film Festival. In 1987 Amelio released \"I ragazzi di via Panisperna\", about the lives of 1930 Italian physicists such as Enrico Fermi and Edoardo Amaldi, which won the award for best screenplay at the Bari Film Festival. 1989's \"Open Doors\" (\"Porte aperte\"), featuring Gian Maria Volonté, confirmed Amelio's status as one of Italy's best film directors and won a nomination as Best Foreign Film at 1991 Academy Awards. The film received also four Felix, two Silver Ribbon, four David di Donatello and three Golden Globes awards.\n\nAlso successful was \"The Stolen Children\" (\"Il ladro di bambini\") in 1992, which won the Special Prize of Jury at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival plus two Silver Ribbon and 5 David di Donatello. In 1994 \"Lamerica\", about Albanian immigration in Italy, repeated the fate and the success, with 2 Silver Ribbons and 3 Davids. Four years later, \"The Way We Laughed\" (\"Così ridevano\") won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. Amelio gained another Silver Ribbon as best director for \"The Keys to the House\" (\"Le chiavi di casa\"), inspired to a novel by Giuseppe Pontiggia, of 2004.\n\nAmelio was a member of jury at the Cannes Film Festival in 1995. In 2006 he released his eighth feature film, \"The Missing Star\" (\"La stella che non c'è\"), featuring Sergio Castellitto. From 2009 to 2012 he has been director of Torino Film Festival, Turin.\n\nAmelio came out as gay late in life, shortly before the release of his 2014 documentary \"Happy to be Different\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is accessible by boat or a 20-minute ferry ride from Steilacoom. Anderson Island lies just south of McNeil Island. To the northwest, Key Peninsula lies across Drayton Passage. The south basin of Puget Sound separates the island from the mainland to the southeast, while to the southwest the Nisqually Reach of Puget Sound separates the island from the mainland.\n\nAnderson Island has a land area of , and reported a population of 1,037 persons as of the 2010 census. The island has been a retirement destination since the late 1960s, with a median age of 54 years (for comparison, the median age of Washington state as a whole is 37 years). The population booms every summer to approximately 4,000. The Island is also home to a sizable population of deer.\n\nThe island was named in 1841 by Charles Wilkes of the United States Exploring Expedition. Given a warm reception at Fort Nisqually by Mr. Anderson and Captain McNeill, and assistance to aid his operations, Wilkes repaid their kindness by naming the two nearby islands after these two men.\nIn 1870, Andrew N. Christensen, a Dane, and his brother, Christian F. Christensen, were the first European settlers to stay at the island. Andrew's wife had a strong hand in the development of the island community. Christian was the only Christensen brother to reside permanently on Anderson Island. The primary industry was the sale of wood to the wood-burning steamers that came into Amsterdam Bay. Other early industries included brick making, farming and fishing.\n\nThe only General Store on the island is run by Dr. and Mrs. Lake of Steilacoom.\n\nIn 2004, National Recreational Properties, Inc. of Irvine, California purchased more than 400 vacant lots on the island, paying roughly $4,000 to $7,000 per lot. They created an infomercial and sold to out-of-state investors, mostly from California. Residents speculated that the lots would be sold for about $25,000. Eventually more than 300 lots were sold, most selling for over $40,000.\n\nAccessible only by ferry or private boat, Anderson Island is served by the Steilacoom / Anderson Island / Ketron Island run, the only ferry run belonging to Pierce County. The ferry \"Steilacoom II\" was put into service in January 2007 to work with the aging ferry \"Christine Anderson\". The ferry runs many times per day, starting at 5:45 in the morning, and going to 10:30 pm on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays (8:00 pm other nights).\n\nThe Anderson Island Citizens Advisory Board (AICAB) is a governing advisory board reporting to the Pierce County Council, established by the Pierce County Council in 2004. Examples of its past actions include banning of boats with internal combustion engines from Lake Josephine, road repair and speed recommendations, as well as other matters common to governing Anderson Island.\n\nFire District #27 and the Anderson Island Parks District are taxing districts that serve only Anderson Island.\n\nThe Steilacoom Historical School District serves Anderson Island. Children in grades K–5 attend school on the island, while children in grades 6–12 commute to the mainland each day. The Anderson Island School is designated a \"remote and necessary\" school by the State of Washington, and is one of the few remaining such schools in the state.\n\nTanner Electric Co-op provides electrical power to Anderson Island via a submarine cable. It extends across Nisqually Reach on the south end of the island and was replaced in 2010.\n\nLaw enforcement is provided by the Pierce County Sheriff's office.\n\n\"The Island Sounder\", published by the Anderson Island Association, is the island's monthly newsletter. \"The News Tribune\" from Tacoma is available to subscribers.\n\nIn the movie \"WarGames\", Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy take a ferry to Anderson Island, named \"Goose Island, Oregon\" in the film. They go to a log cabin owned by a person called \"Stephen Falken.\"\nHeckman, Hazel, \"Island in the Sound\", University of Washington Press (1967) Drawings by Helen Hiatt\n\nHeckman, Hazel, \"Island Year\", University of Washington Press (1972) Drawings by Laurie Olin\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1896237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896237", "title": "DartMUD", "text": "DartMUD\n\nDartMUD is a MUD, a text-based online role-playing game, started in 1991 at Dartmouth College. It pioneered several interface and game play innovations which were later used to greater popular success by games such as \"Ultima Online\".\n\nThe actual dates of the first implementation of these ideas in MUDs or MMORPGs are not well documented and competing claims exist, but \"DartMUD\" was first, among the first, or an early adopter of the following:\n\nGame designer and industry author Raph Koster has mentioned \"DartMUD\" as an influential game in general and regarding many specific topics, such as hex mapping, simulationism, player-run economy, and crafting. Other mud developers have occasionally mentioned \"DartMUD\" on MUD-DEV, the MUD Developers' mailing list. Koster and others often cite \"DartMUD\" as an innovative MUD that failed or fell short in execution.\n\n\"DartMUD\" was one of twelve MUDs selected, by virtue of its Google search ranking, to receive player surveys by authors Anthony Faiola and Alexander E. Voiskounsky while researching their paper \"Flow Experience of MUD Players: Investigating Multi-User Dimension Gamers from the USA\".\n\nThe primary limitation on character actions is a 'concentration' system. The exercise of player skills reduces the chance that a subsequent skill check (of any skill, not just the same skill) will be successful. This penalty goes away fairly quickly, but it serves to prevent abuse based on the speed of prepared (e.g. client-side macro) input.\n\nThe founders of \"DartMUD\" decided to try to capture the unpredictability of the Rolemaster RPG's open-ended die rolling system using a custom implemented Cauchy distribution function. The unpredictable extremes of the Cauchy function have occasionally resulted in very memorably improbable results.\n\n\"DartMUD\" also uses a seeded random number generator, which allows for certain similar \"random\" events to produce identical results, simulating the pointlessness of attempting certain actions twice: if an action failed once, it will fail again unless something has changed in a subsequent attempt.\n\nCreatures in \"DartMUD\" possess \"shapes\" — a creature's shape file determines how many limbs it has, how many objects it can hold, natural armor, relative size and durability, and effects when one or more limbs are disabled. Players may choose races which have from four to eight limbs, including one to four hands.\n\n\"DartMUD\" is a classless system, which means any skill may be learned by anyone. However, only some skills can be self-taught; others must be learned from a non-player character (NPC) or player teacher. Many skills aren't taught by NPCs, forcing a greater level of player interaction. Skills are improved by practicing relevant tasks of increasing difficulty, not by spending experience points. While DartMUD doesn't have classes, requirements to practice skills to improve them and positive feedback for learning similar skills provide incentive for characters to specialize, encouraging player interdependence.\n\nDue to the player-run economy, crafting skills provide greater game rewards than thief skills. In fact, since thieves mainly prey on other characters in \"DartMUD\", they are generally hunted and killed if discovered. Since combat is not required to advance, some players thrive despite avoiding violence altogether.\n\nIn \"DartMUD\", roleplaying (RP) is not enforced by the staff. Rather, a confluence of factors — prominent among them permadeath, player interdependence, and the desire for wealth — create an unsimulated political system. \"An armed society is a polite society\" (Robert A. Heinlein) is a good summation: characters behave themselves in public and do their scheming behind closed doors. Using out-of-character communications to influence game play is against the rules, and the creators reserve the right to delete and even ban problematic abusers.\n\nPlayers new to \"DartMUD\" have been advised to use a \"disposable\" character for their initial learning process, anticipating that they will make mistakes in their early socialization; a fresh start once the initial learning curve is past allows for community engagement with a clean reputation.\n\nIn \"DartMUD\", magic items are rare and characters rarely gain special abilities; consequently, more mundane objects gain greater significance. As characters accumulate wealth, they require a place to keep it. Like other LPMuds of its era, \"DartMUD\" initially had no facility for equipment storage. As available disk space and processing power increased, storage facilities were added to the game in the form of collective resources for which players could strive: Castles, Guild halls, and Inns.\n\n\nCastles and Guilds form factions; tensions arise from wars and shifting alliances.\n\n\n\"DartMUD\" is maintained by donations from staff and players alike — since 2004, more than half of operating expenses have been covered by player contributions using PayPal. Unlike many other MUDs which encourage player donations, \"DartMUD\" never has conveyed any in-game reward or recognition to players who donate.\n"}

A traveller with a ticket for either G1 or G2 is also able to travel within the shaded city centre area, but travel into an outer Glasgow zone (G3 to G8) requies a minimum of three zones. Tickets with three Glasgow zones are valid for travel in all Glasgow zones (G1 to G8). The city centre is served by both inner Glasgow zones, and purchasing one of these entitles the user to use the subway system in both areas.\n\nA child's zonecard with 6 zones or an adult zonecard with 13 zones, entitles the user to travel throughout all zones.\n\nA ZoneCard consists of a photocard and a paper counterpart which displays the validity period and is used for operating the barriers on Glasgow's Subway. Previously, passengers who have validated their tickets for the Subway needed to have their tickets manually checked at the ticket barriers at Glasgow Queen Street station because the barriers accept only standard-sized Subway tickets. In 2004, the Glasgow Queen Street barriers were updated so that ZoneCards did not need validation to operate them. The card can be purchased in durations of 1 week, 4 weeks, 10 weeks, and 1 year.\n\nThe ZoneCard can be used with any participating transport provider within the zones that the holder has purchased. With a total of approximately 70 transport providers—across bus, rail, and ferry services—in the scheme, there are very few companies who do not accept ZoneCards. The only TOC which doesn't accept ZoneCards is TransPennine Express.\n\nOperators criticise the complexity of the zone system, which consists of 77 zones. By comparison, Transport for London's scheme consists of 9 zones despite containing 90 more underground stations than the SPT does rail stations. However, the TfL system only covers , an area slightly smaller than South Lanarkshire. In addition, the SPT bus network is far larger due to the greater size of its zone system.\n\nThe revenue from the scheme is split between the participating operators (the administration costs are absorbed by SPT) based on a number of factors, such as the number of routes operated by a provider, an annual user survey, and passenger counts by SPT officials. Some operators (notably Abellio ScotRail) are guaranteed a certain percentage of the revenue regardless of these factors but more recently Avanti West Coast, LNER and CrossCountry also receive revenue from ZoneCards as their trains provide services between Glasgow and Motherwell and vice versa. Aside from the previously mentioned administration costs, the scheme is designed to be self-supporting, unlike some other tickets which are subsidised with public money to help the significant percentage of households in the region that do not have access to a car.\n\n\n"}

It stars Urmila Matondkar. The film was premiered in the Marché du Film section of the 2005 Cannes Film Festival. The film is a remake of the 2002 Hong Kong-Singaporean horror film \"The Eye\" directed by the Pang brothers.\n\nIts release caused controversy in India because its depiction of the protagonist seeing ghosts after receiving a corneal transplant was similar to existing fears in India surrounding corneal transplants and it was feared the film would discourage people from donating corneas or seeking corneal transplants.\n\nDuring a solar eclipse in 1986, young Naina Shah, while traveling in the backseat of her England-based dad's car, is struck by glass from the shattered windshield during an accident, and loses her eyesight. Her parents do not survive, and she is brought up by her paternal grandmother. Years later, Naina gets a successful corneal transplant, and is able to see. She complains of vision problems, seeing hooded persons, and people dying, which a psychiatrist, Samir Patel, diagnoses as hallucinations. But when Naina reports seeing someone else in her mirror reflection, Sameer decides to investigate who the original cornea actually belonged to. This investigation will lead them to an impoverished village in New Bhuj, Gujarat, where she will find her life endangered by hostile villagers who believe that the donor of her cornea was cursed.\n\n\n\"Naina\" received mostly positive reviews from the critics. Taran Adarsh from Bollywood Hungama said, \"NAINA is one of the most imaginative and pulse-pounding horror films to come along in recent times. It leaves the viewer frightened, terrified and petrified. As a horror movie, it packs one genuine scare after another, right till its finale\". Urmila Matondkar was especially praised for her performance.\n\nThe film got a 50% opening in the first week, but its collections increased heavily. At last it was given a 'hit' tag.\n"}

He has been the voice of the Eagles since 1977.\n\nReese is a graduate of Temple University earning a bachelor's degree in Communications and Broadcasting. While in college, he learned his craft by doing play-by-play over the college's radio station, WRTI FM. At WRTI, Reese also had a music show every Wednesday afternoon where he spun 45-rpm records from his own personal collection.\n\nAfter college and a stint in the United States Navy, Reese set out to obtain his first paid broadcasting gig auditioning at WCOJ in Coatesville, Pennsylvania and WPAZ in Pottstown, Pennsylvania.\n\nReese eventually landed a job in Philadelphia as a newscaster and sportscaster at WHAT and its FM companion, WWDB-FM. After a few years he moved on to WIP as a backup for that station's Sports Director, Charlie Swift, who did drive-time sportscasts and Philadelphia Eagles play-by-play. While Swift was vacationing, Reese began doing the pre-game and post-game shows for the Eagles on WIP and later was assigned to do color commentary during the games. Hours after Swift committed suicide on December 7, 1977, Reese was immediately promoted to Eagles play-by-play voice. His debut in that capacity was a 17–14 home victory over the New York Giants four days later on December 11. Herb Adderley took over the color commentary for the remainder of the season.\n\nHe is the longest-serving current play-by-play announcer in the NFL. Reese's current broadcast partner is former Eagles wide receiver Mike Quick, who joined Reese in the booth in 1998. Aside from Swift and Adderley, Reese has previously been joined in the booth by Jim Barniak (1978–82), Bill Bergey (1982–83, and who also filled in when Quick had knee surgery during the 2004 preseason), and Stan Walters (1984–97).\n\nIn addition to his play-by-play radio coverage of the Eagles, Reese hosts The WIP Coach's Show the day after Eagles games with the Eagles head coach, Eagles players and other guests.\n\nOn Sunday, February 4, 2018, Reese called Super Bowl LII, as the Eagles defeated the New England Patriots 41-33 for their first Super Bowl title. With 38 seconds remaining in the 2nd quarter, he called the Eagles' 4th and Goal play which would later be known as the \"Philly Special\" thus:\n\n\"“Foles in the gun. Clement to his right. Now lines up behind Foles. Foles moves to the right and it goes directly to Clement and Clement reverses it and it goes into the end zone...AND IT'S A TOUCHDOWN BY NICK FOLES!\"\"\n\nThen, in the 4th quarter, Reese called the game's final play:\n\n\"\"Batted around...and incomplete! And the game is over! The game is over! The Philadelphia Eagles are Super Bowl champions. Eagles fans everywhere, this is for you. Let the celebration begin!”\"\n\nReese was inducted to the Philadelphia Eagles Hall of Fame in 2016.\n\nReese is co-owner of 1490 WBCB (AM) in Levittown, Pennsylvania, a Bucks County suburb north of Philadelphia.\n\nReese's autobiography, \"It's Gooooood!\", was published in 1998.

{"id": "1896258", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896258", "title": "Ghat", "text": "Ghat\n\nGhat, a term used in the Indian subcontinent, depending on the context could refer either to a range of stepped-hills with valleys (ghati in Hindi), such as the Eastern Ghats and Western Ghats; or the series of steps leading down to a body of water or wharf, such as a bathing or cremation place along the banks of a river or pond, the Ghats in Varanasi, Dhobi Ghat or the Aapravasi Ghat. Roads passing through ghats are called Ghat Roads.\n\nThe word 'Ghat' has been derived from Dravidian etymons such as Tamil/Kannada words \"Kaatu\"/\"Kaadu\"(காடு/ಕಾಡು) (Forest, Side of a mountain, ridge)or Telugu \"katta\" and \"gattu\" (dam and embankment)\n\nThe word \"ghati\" (Hindi: घाटी) means valley. In Marathi, Hindi, Gujarati and Kannada, \"ghat\" is a term used to identify a difficult passage over a mountain. One such passage is the Bhor Ghat that connects the towns Khopoli and Khandala, on NH 4 about north of Mumbai. Charmadi Ghat of Karnataka is also notable. In many cases, the term is used to refer to a mountain range itself, as in the \"Western Ghats\" and \"Eastern Ghats\". 'Ghattam' in Malayalam also refers to mountain ranges when used with the name of the ranges being addressed (e.g., paschima ghattam for Western Ghats), while the passage road would be called a 'churam'. Eastern Ghats on the east coast of India and Western Ghats on the west coast of India are the largest ghats in pensular India.\n\nWestern Ghats, also known as \"Sahyadri\" (Benevolent Mountains), is a mountain range covers an area of 140,000 km² in a stretch of 1,600 km parallel to the western coast of the Indian peninsula, traverse the States of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Goa, Maharashtra and Gujarat. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is one of the eight \"hottest hot-spots\" of biological diversity in the world. It is sometimes called the Great Escarpment of India.. It is a biodiversity hotspot that contains a large proportion of the country's flora and fauna; many of which are only found here and nowhere else in the world. According to UNESCO, Western Ghats are older than Himalayan mountains. It also influences Indian monsoon weather patterns by \nintercepting the rain-laden monsoon winds that sweep in from the south-west during late summer. The range runs north to south along the western edge of the Deccan Plateau, and separates the plateau from a narrow coastal plain, called Konkan, along the Arabian Sea. A total of thirty-nine properties including national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and reserve forests were designated as world heritage sites - twenty in Kerala, ten in Karnataka, five in Tamil Nadu and four in Maharashtra. Ghati people, literally means the \"people of hills or ghats (valleys)\", is an exonym used for the marathi people specially those from the villages in Western Ghats, often in pejorative terms.\n\nThe Eastern Ghats are a discontinuous range of mountains along India's eastern coast. The Eastern Ghats run from the northern Odisha through Andhra Pradesh to Tamil Nadu in the south passing some parts of Karnataka and in the Wayanad region of Kerala. They are eroded and cut through by four major rivers of peninsular India, viz. Godavari, Mahanadi, Krishna, and Kaveri. The mountain ranges run parallel to the Bay of Bengal. The Deccan Plateau lies to the west of the range, between the Eastern Ghats and the Western Ghats. The coastal plains, including the Coromandel Coast region, lie between the Eastern Ghats and the Bay of Bengal. The Eastern Ghats are not as high as the Western Ghats. The Eastern Ghats are older than the Western Ghats, and have a complex geologic history related to the assembly and breakup of the ancient supercontinent of Rodinia and the assembly of the Gondwana supercontinent. The Eastern Ghats are made up of charnockites, granite gneiss, khondalites, metamorphic gneisses and quartzite rock formations. The structure of the Eastern Ghats includes thrusts and strike-slip faults all along its range. Limestone, bauxite and iron ore are found in the Eastern Ghats hill ranges.\n\nThe numerous significant ghats along the Ganges are the Varanasi ghats (the city of Varanasi has 88 ghats) and generically the \"ghats of the Ganges\". Most of these were constructed under the patronage of various Maratha rulers such as Ahilyabai Holkar (Queen of the Malwa Kingdom from 1767 to 1795) in the 18th century.\n\nIn Madhya Pradesh in central India there are further significant ghats along the Narmada River. People who live on the steps are also called ghats.\n\nGhats such as these are useful for both mundane purposes (such as cleaning) and religious rites (i.e. ritual bathing or ablutions); there are also specific \"shmashana\" or \"cremation\" ghats where bodies are cremated waterside, allowing ashes to be washed away by rivers; notable ones are Nigambodh Ghat and Raj Ghat in Delhi on the Yamuna, the latter of which was the cremation area for Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and numerous political leaders after him, and the Manikarnika Ghat at Varanasi on the Ganges.\n\n\"Ghat\" and \"Ghata\" is also a suffix used in several place names across the subcontinent. This is an incomplete list:\n\nThe word is also used in some places outside the Indian subcontinent where there are Indian communities. For example, in George Town, Penang in Malaysia, the label \"Ghaut\" is used to identify the extensions of those streets which formerly ended in ghats before reclamation of the quayside (e.g., Church St Ghaut - in Malay \"Gat Lebuh Gereja\" - is the name of the extension of Church St beyond where the street used to descend to the water via a ghat). In both Penang and Singapore, there are areas named Dhoby Ghaut (dhobi meaning \"launderer\" or \"laundry\", depending on whether it refers to a person or a business). \n\nAapravasi Ghat or \"The Immigration Depot\" is a building complex located in Port Louis on the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius, the first British colony to receive indentured, or contracted, labour workforce from India. From 1849 to 1923, half a million Indian indentured labourers passed through the Immigration Depot, to be transported to plantations throughout the British Empire. The large-scale migration of the laborers left an indelible mark on the societies of many former British colonies, with Indians constituting a substantial proportion of their national populations. In Mauritius alone, 68 percent of the current total population is of Indian ancestry. The Immigration Depot has thus become an important reference point in the history and cultural identity of Mauritius.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1896263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896263", "title": "Emperor Lizong", "text": "Emperor Lizong\n\nEmperor Lizong of Song (26 January 1205 – 16 November 1264), personal name Zhao Yun, was the 14th emperor of the Song dynasty in China and the fifth emperor of the Southern Song dynasty. He reigned from 1224 to 1264.\n\nHis original name was Zhao Yuju but later changed his name to Zhao Guicheng and then finally changed his name to Zhao Yun being elevated to a imperial son. Although he was a descendant of the Song dynasty's founder Zhao Kuangyin (Emperor Taizu) through his son Zhao Dezhao and hence a member of the imperial clan, Zhao Yun was not in line to succeed to the throne as his family had no political status. Shi Miyuan (), who was the chancellor for many years, collaborated with Empress Dowager Yang and when Emperor Ningzong eventually died in 1224, Shi, along with Empress Dowager Yang, supplanted the reigning crown prince Zhao Hong and replaced him with Zhao Yun as emperor, reigning with the era name Baoqing and the temple name Lizong. The 40-year-reign of Emperor Lizong did little to nothing to improve the Dynasty and instead sought pleasure even as the Mongols were terrorizing the borders. He died at age 59 in 1264 and was succeeded by his nephew Emperor Duzong.\n\nAlthough related to the Song imperial family, Emperor Lizong was only distantly related as he was the 10th generation descendant of the founding Song Emperor, Emperor Taizu more than 250 years before. Emperor Lizong spent his childhood in obscurity living away from the imperial court in Shaoxing, Zhejiang as a minor official. One rainy day in his early teens, along with his younger brother Zhao Yurui, Lizong stood huddling under a bridge along with an official, Yu Tianxi, who was sent by Chancellor Shi Miyuan tasked to locate a suitable successor to the Song throne as the incumbent crown prince Zhao Xun has recently passed away at the age of 29. After discovering the true identity of this teenager, Yu quickly informed Shi Miyuan who agreed to groom Lizong to be replaced as the crown prince. It is said that Lizong was serious, studious, mostly silent, and wise before assuming the throne. When Ningzong died in 1224, Shi Miyuan told Lizong to enter the throne room and then ordered Zhao Hong, then the current crown prince into the room. Shi Miyuan subsequently declared Lizong emperor and according to history, he was wearing a white robe and the lights reflected his shadow on the throne. The result of Lizong becoming Emperor angered Zhao Hong who refused to bow until he was forced to by the palace commander. He was then sent away. \n\nLizong's long reign of 40 years did little to improve the predicament of the Song Empire in his time. The court of Emperor Lizong was dominated by consort clans, Yan and Jia, the eunuchs Dong Songchen and Lu Yunsheng, and his Co-Regent Empress Dowager Yang. The Emperor was uninterested in governmental affairs, and for the first decade of his rule he delegated matters into the hands of his ministers, notably Shi Miyuan, who was the \"de facto\" ruler in his absence. Many critics blamed Lizong's leadership for the eventual fall of the Song dynasty.\n\nA year after Emperor Lizong took the throne, he honored Zhu Xi with the posthumous name Duke of Hui (徽國公). Lizong faced a minor rebellion led by the former crown prince Zhao Hong which was put down after two weeks; Zhao Hong himself was executed.\n\nFrom the winter of 1230 to the autumn of 1231, the Mongols forcibly passed through the Song Dynasty. In the region centered on the three passes of Shukou, they entered into a series of battles with the Song army. This was the second and largest armed conflict between them before the Mongol conquest of Song officially began. This forced Lizong to ally with the Mongols as they might conquer the Song.\n\nWuzhun Shifan, a monk was summoned by Emperor Lizong in 1233. Emperor Lizong discussed with Wuzhun about Zen Buddhism, and Dharma.\n\nAfter Shi Miyuan's death in 1233, Emperor Lizong assumed full authority briefly but again quickly abandoned the responsibility of ruling and delegated matters to his chancellor Ding Daquan in order to pursue personal enjoyment. It was said that the emperor often drank wine a lot, frequented brothels and invited prostitutes into the palace in his late years, which was vehemently opposed by his ministers.\n\nNotable events during Emperor Lizong's reign included the demise of the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty in 1234, which was obliterated by the joint forces of the Mongol Empire and the Song Dynasty. The Jurchens had fought multiple wars with the Song Empire decades before it was conquered by the Mongols and although their ruler Emperor Aizong tried to make peace with the Song Dynasty to warn them that if the Mongols conquered the Jin Dynasty and they would attack the Song next, Emperor Lizong ignored the warning.\n\nOnce the Jin dynasty has fallen, the Song dynasty attempted to take back its northern territories originally occupied by the Jin and took back Luoyang and Kaifeng in July 1234. However, in September 1234, the Mongols counterattacked with the siege of Luoyang. The Song army holding Luoyang was short of food supplies. Additionally, the Mongols diverted the water of Yellow River into the city causing great casualties among the Song army.\nThe fall of Luoyang was simply a prologue of a series of upcoming battles which lasted decades. The fall of Luoyang also began the official start of the Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty. The Mongols blamed the Song for \"breaking the alliance\". However, it was more of an excuse for further Mongol expeditions.\n\nOther notable events include the Song's ally Dali falling to the Mongols.\n\nEmperor Lizong met Zhao Yifu (1189–1256), who was a minister and a defender of Jiangnan. Lizong started to Yifu, \"You have had two years of great toil, minister.\" Yifu said \"My memorials have all reflected Your Majesty's virtue. I have not had a hair of merit.\" Emperor Lizong replied \"You discussed urgent matters like preventing rebellions, imperial succession, and the drought that hit Jiangnan and Hunan.\" Yifu then said \"King Tang reproached himself over the six affairs. Your Majesty should determine whether in the present circumstances there is a ‘six affairs’ [situation].\" Yifu was named imperial reader-in-waiting the next day.\n\nIn 1241, Töregene Khatun had sent an envoy to make peace proposals and discuss with Emperor Lizong. However, the Song court arrested the envoy and imprisoned him in a fortress with his suite of seventy people. The envoy died, but his suite were detained until 1254. That year the Mongol army attacked to take Hejiu but failed. The Chinese freed the suite of the late envoy to show their desire for peace.\n\nThe New Khan Möngke concentrated all his attention on the conquest of the Song dynasty. Taking personal command late in the decade, he captured many of the fortified cities along the northern front. In October 1257 Möngke set out for South China, leaving his administration to his brother, Ariq Böke.\n\nWen Tianxiang and Lu Xiufu passed the imperial examination where Emperor Lizong personally gave Wen first rank.\n\nIn 1259, the Song government was forced to capitulate and cede all territories north of the Yangtze River to the Mongols. Despite this, Möngke Khan was killed earlier in the year in a siege with no designated heir setting the stage for the Division of the Mongol Empire. The invasions frightened Lizong to the extent that he attempted to move the Song capital but was stopped by his Empress Xie Daoqing; she thought that if they moved, it would create chaos among the people.\n\nIn 1260, Jia Sidao became chancellor who would eventually soon take control over the new emperor Zhao Qi after Lizong's death and expel his opponents like Wen Tianxiang and Li Fu.\n\nIn December 1261, Lizong arranged a marriage between his adopted son Zhao Qi and the 33-year-old Quan Jiu. Quan Jiu was a grandniece of Lizong's mother (who had by then died by now) making Quan a cousin of Zhao Qi. An account in Quan's official biography stated that Lizong ordered her to enter the palace where he greeted her, \"Your father Zhaosun died in the service of his majesty in the Baoyou reign, the very thought of which makes me grieve.\" Quan replied \"My father can be remembered, but even more should the plight of the masses of the Huai and Hu regions be remembered!\" greatly impressing Lizong who said to his high-ranking officials \"The words of this daughter of the Quan family are particularly \"grandiloquent\". A betrothal should be arranged with the heir-apparent to permit continuation of the ritual line.\"\n\nInternal-combustion rocket propulsion is mentioned in a reference to 1264, recording that the \"ground-rat\", a type of firework, had frightened the Empress-Mother Gongsheng at a feast held in her honor by her son Emperor Lizong.\n\nAlso in 1264, Emperor Lizong died sonless (his sons died prematurely) from a illness and was succeeded by his adopted son and biological nephew, Zhao Qi, known as Emperor Duzong after his death.\n\nOne of his daughters married a descendant of Zhu Xi.\n\nEmperor Lizong was a skilled poet and calligrapher. The Metropolitan Museum reports, \"Lizong was the finest calligrapher among the Song emperors who came after Gaozong (r. 1127–62).\" Lizong developed his own unique calligraphic style which was easily recognizable as it showed sharp and rapid brush strokes. The Metropolitan Museum says, \"Lizong developed his own unique manner, which was distinguished by angular brushstrokes with straight rapid brush movements—in contrast to the slower, more rounded brushstrokes of Gaozong—and by his preference for Tang, rather than Jin, dynasty models.\" Emperor Lizong also expresses his feelings in his poems as shown in his poem 'Quatrain on Late Spring' which reads: \nIn this poem, it is clearly established that Emperor Lizong laments old age.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1896269", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896269", "title": "Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa", "text": "Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa\n\nThe Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa, or 250 TR, is a racing sports car built by Ferrari from 1957 to 1961. It was introduced at the end of the 1957 racing season in response to rule changes that enforced a maximum engine displacement of 3 liters for the 24 Hours of Le Mans and World Sports Car Championship races. The 250 TR was closely related to earlier Ferrari sports cars, sharing many key components with other 250 models and the 500 TR. \n\nThe 250 TR achieved many racing successes, with variations winning 10 World Sports Car Championship races including the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1958, 1960, and 1961, the 12 Hours of Sebring in 1958, 1959 and 1961, the Targa Florio in 1958, the 1000 Km Buenos Aires in 1958 and 1960 and the Pescara 4 Hours in 1961. These results led to World Sports Car Championship constructor's titles for Ferrari in 1958, 1960 and 1961. \n\nThe 250 Testa Rossa was initially developed to compete in the 1957 World Sports Car Championship racing season, in response to rule changes planned for the upcoming 1958 season that would enforce a maximum engine displacement of 3 liters. The objective was to improve on the existing 4-cylinder 2.0L 500 TR/500 TRC Testa Rossa by integrating the more powerful Colombo-designed 3.0L V12 as used in 250 GT series. Along with the new engine, Ferrari improved the existing Testa Rossa chassis and bodywork. As with other Ferrari racing cars, Enzo Ferrari demanded absolute reliability from all components, resulting in a somewhat conservative design approach that aimed for endurance racing success through durability rather than overall speed. Carlo Chiti was the chief designer during 250 TR development and his continual experimentation counterbalanced Mr. Ferrari's conservatism and led to the many revisions that kept the car competitive through 1962. Other Ferrari engineers had major contributions to the 250 TR, notably Giotto Bizzarrini, who helped with aerodynamic improvements for the 1961 season, and Andrea Fraschetti, who helped developed the first 250 TR prototype before his 1957 death during a test drive.\n\nThe 250 TR was raced and continually developed by Scuderia Ferrari from 1957 through 1962. In total, 33 250 TRs of all types were built between 1957 and 1962. Included in this total are 19 \"customer versions\" of the 250 TR sold to independent racing teams, replacing the 500 TRC for this market. All customer cars had left hand drive Scaglietti \"pontoon fender\" bodies and live rear axles. They did not benefit from the continual improvements to Scuderia Ferrari cars, although many independent teams modified their 250 TRs or purchased ex-Scuderia Ferrari cars in order to stay competitive. \n\nThe 250 Testa Rossa engine was based on Colombo-designed 3.0L V12 used in 250 GT road and racing cars. Carlo Chiti and other Ferrari engineers made several modifications to increase the performance of this already proven engine. The starting point was a 1953-style cylinder block with an overall capacity of 2953 cc, a 73mm bore and 58.8 mm stroke. Six two-barrel Weber 38 DCN carburetors fed the engine, increased from the 3 carburetors typical for 250 GT engines. The cylinder heads used single overhead cams, 2 valves per cylinder and helical double-coil valve springs (a first for Ferrari). The helical valve springs were much smaller than previously used torsion springs, allowing the cylinder heads to be strengthened and secured with 24 studs rather than 18 in previous 250 engines. This increased the overall reliability of the engine by improving head gasket sealing. One spark plug was used per cylinder and the position was changed from earlier 250 designs, now located outside the engine vee between exhaust ports. This allowed for a better spark position and more efficient combustion. Piston connecting rods were now machined from steel billet, rather than forged, which resulted in more stress-resistance at higher RPMs. The cam covers were painted bright red, the source of the name \"Testa Rossa\" (literally, \"Red Head\"). This tradition and name originated with the 500 TR.\n\nThe resulting engine was designated Tipo 128 and generated at 7000 rpm. The power/displacement ratio of 100 hp/liter was a particular point of pride for Ferrari, as it demonstrated how Ferrari's engineering prowess could create a competitive engine even under rules restricting displacement. The engineering team improved a well understood, proven design by incorporating new technology and strengthening known weak points. They created an exceptionally durable engine, a massive benefit in endurance racing. Other Ferrari racing cars (250 GTO, 250 P) achieved racing success with the same basic engine well into the 1960s, years after the 250 TR chassis was obsolete. \n\n1957-1958 250 TRs used a 4-speed transmission, followed by a 5-speed transmission in 1959. Customer cars were equipped with a 250 GT-style transmission positioned directly behind the engine, while Scuderia Ferrari team cars sometimes used rear-mounted transaxles for better weight distribution.\n\nThe 250 Testa Rossa used a tubular steel spaceframe chassis, similar to that used in the 500 TR. Compared to the 500 TR, the wheelbase was extended by 10 cm to 2.35 meters. The chassis gained a reputation for durability, as it was designed according to Enzo Ferrari's desire for absolute reliability even at the expense of excess weight. \n\nAll 250 TRs used independent front suspension with coil springs. All customer cars had live rear axles. Pre-1960 factory team cars used either live or de Dion rear axles while the 1960 250 TRI60 and 1961 250 TRI61 used independent rear suspension. \n\n1957 and 1958 250 TRs were equipped with drum brakes on all four wheels. Enzo Ferrari insisted on the use of drum brakes in the early 250 TRs as he believed they were more reliable and predictable in how they faded compared to more powerful but relatively new disc brakes. Drum brakes were unpopular with drivers as they required tremendous physical exertion to operate, due to lack of servo assist and the extremely hard, long-lasting pads used for endurance races. Despite the extensive air cooling used in the 1958 \"pontoon fender\"-bodied cars, drum brakes were still subject to heat-induced fade. They were finally replaced with Dunlop disc brakes in all Scuderia Ferrari cars for the 1959 race season. \n\nAll 250 TRs had 2-seater spider bodies, as did the earlier 4-cylinder Testa Rossas. At the time, this was considered the lightest and most aerodynamic configuration for a racing sports car.\n\nThe first 250 Testa Rossa prototype (chassis number 0666TR) debuted at the 1957 Nürburgring 1000km. This hastily prepared prototype was based on a 290 MM chassis and had conventional bodywork by Scaglietti very similar to that of the 4-cylinder 500 TR, except for a large hood bulge. \nFor the 1958 250 TR, new bodywork was developed in collaboration between Scaglietti and Chiti with several innovations on the previous 4-cylinder Testa Rossa body. Instead of the conventional fully enclosed front end, the new body had a distinctive cut-away nose reminiscent of a Formula 1 car. The protuberant central air intake was now flanked by deep channels and the headlights were set into nacelle- or pontoon-like fenders that enveloped each front wheel. The purpose of this design was to funnel cooling air inwards towards the brake drums, mitigating the persistent problem of heat-related fade. The lower body was recessed inwards behind the front wheels in order to vent heat from the brakes and exhaust. The front hood was topped with a large bulge and air intake (forward facing on some cars, reverse facing on others) to provide clearance for the vertically oriented carburetors. The rear bodywork was more conventional, including a tapered fairing behind the driver's head and two small brake lights set into vertical fins. \n\nThe distinctive cutaway-nose bodywork of the 1958 cars became the most iconic 250 TR style and was used on all cars sold new to private customers. This resulted in the colloquial name for early Scaglietti-bodied 250 TRs: \"pontoon fender.\" Despite their radical appearance, racing and test runs soon showed that this design generated a significant amount of aerodynamic drag and high speed instability. This was especially noticeable when competing on high speed courses such as the Circuit de la Sarthe against more aerodynamic cars such as the Maserati Tipo 61 and Jaguar D-Type. As a result, the Scaglietti bodywork was soon revised and a wide variety of alternative styles were created from 1958 through 1961. Even during 1958, some Scuderia Ferrari cars were equipped with more conventional bodies in the style of the 1957 prototype. \n\nThe 250 TR's open interior was simple and utilitarian, lacking the luxury trimmings found in Ferrari GT cars. The instrumentation and controls were completely focused around the driver. Like other 1950s and 1960s Ferrari sports cars, 250 TRs were equipped with an open gated shifter and a Nardi wooden steering wheel. \n\nThe 250 TR was subject to continual iteration and refinement from 1957 to 1961, resulting in numerous differences between individual cars that may or may not coincide with different chassis production dates. As was common with Ferrari racing cars of the 1950s and 1960s, 250 TRs were frequently modified and updated by the Ferrari factory and/or private owners. Bodywork was often changed to improve performance or to repair crash damage. Ferrari historians track these changes with a numbering suffix based on year of production (such as 250 TR61 for a 1961-style car) as well as descriptors such as \"Spider Fantuzzi\" to denote cars with bodies fabricated by Fantuzzi. Despite this historiographical systematization, the low-production, hand-built nature of these cars and their use and modification in period mean that differences are most thoroughly explained in the context of an individual chassis' history.\n\nFor the 1959 season, the 250 TR body design was lightly revised by Pinin Farina, with fabrication of the bodies handled by Fantuzzi. The cutaway nose with pontoon fenders was gone, replaced by a more aerodynamic design that still incorporated many ventilation grilles and air inlets. \n\nThe 1959 250 TR was the first Ferrari sports car to use disc brakes (manufactured by Dunlop). Disc brakes are much less susceptible to heat build-up and fade than drum brakes, so the extra air cooling provided by the 1958 Scaglietti body was no longer necessary. \n\nA 5-speed transmission mounted directly behind the engine was also introduced in 1959. \n\nDry sump lubrication systems became standard equipment for all 250 TRs in 1960. This allowed the engine to sit lower in the chassis, lowering the car's center of mass for improved handling and enabling a lower, more aerodynamic front profile. \n\nRear independent suspension was introduced to the 250 TR in 1960. The car equipped with independent suspension was designated the 250 TRI60 (chassis 0780TR) and throughout the season raced alongside the 250 TR60 equipped with a conventional de Dion rear axle.\n\nThe body of the 250 TR again changed for the 1960 season, primarily due to new regulations requiring a windshield with a vertical height of 25 cm. The new, larger windshield was immediately disliked by drivers, as it was difficult to see over, the plexiglass material could not be effectively cleared by windshield wipers, and the much larger surface area increased drag. The excess drag resulted in a top speed of down the Mulsanne Straight at Le Mans. In comparison, during the same race Masten Gregory's Maserati Tipo 61 reached approximately .\n\n1959 cars that were updated to 1960 specification (minus independent rear suspension) are often designated as 250 TR59/60.\n\nAll 1961 250 Testa Rossas were designated 250 TRI61 as independent rear suspension was now standard.\n\nDue to high drag and visibility problems with the TR60 body style, Ferrari engineers including Giotto Bizzarini and Carlo Chiti were tasked with completely re-designing the 250 TR bodywork for the 1961 racing season. As a result, the new Fantuzzi-built TRI61 body incorporated a number of dramatic changes, informed by new aerodynamic theories and wind-tunnel testing. The windshield now had a more gradual slope and wrapped around both sides of the cockpit to meet the rear bodywork. Instead of the rounded tail with fairing for the driver's head, the TRI61 had a very high rear body that met the trailing edge of the side windows and tapered to a truncated, slightly concave Kamm tail. This bodystyle was called an \"open coupe\" and was very similar to bodies used on mid-engined Ferrari sports racers such as the 1961 246 SP. \n\nThe front air inlet was now split into two openings, introducing the distinctive \"sharknose\" or \"nostril\" style that was also used on other Ferrari sports racing cars such as the 246 SP and the 156 Formula 1 car. This front end styling had first appeared on a trio of Maserati 250Fs that Fantuzzi re-bodied in 1958 for racer Ross Jensen and team owner Temple Buell (son of the architect with the same name). Fantuzzi's suggestion that the twin intakes would improve air penetration was confirmed by Chiti's wind tunnel testing, leading to the adoption of this style throughout Ferrari's 1961 racing cars.\n\nDuring testing of the 250 TRI61, a full-width angled \"deflector\" panel was installed along the top edge of the rear bodywork. This was initially installed to prevent exhaust fumes from entering the cockpit under deceleration. After testing the prototype with the deflector, driver Richie Ginther commented that high-speed stability seemed to improve with only a slight reduction in top speed, leading to the inclusion of this feature on all 1961 bodies. The Ferrari engineers had in effect created a rear spoiler, well before engineers understood the aerodynamic theory behind them and integrated them into many car designs. \n\nFor the 1962 season, Ferrari developed the final iteration of the front-engined Testa Rossa, the 330 TRI/LM (LM standing for Le Mans). The biggest change from the 250 TR was a Tipo 163 4.0 Liter Colombo V12 developed from the engine of the 400 Superamerica, further improved with Testa Rossa cylinder heads and other modifications seen on 250 TR engines. This engine produced at 7500 rpm, significantly more power than the 250-series 3.0L unit. This engine design would be used again in the 1964 330 P.\n\nThe single 330 TRI/LM (chassis number 0808) was built from a damaged 250 TRI60 (chassis 0780TR). The original chassis was lengthened and a TRI61-style spider body by Fantuzzi was fitted. At the 1962 24 Hours of Le Mans, this car was driven by Olivier Gendebien and Phil Hill and became the last front-engine car to win an overall victory at Le Mans.\n\nThe 250 Testa Rossa was raced successfully throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s. Independent teams raced the 250 TR alongside Scuderia Ferrari cars from 1958 on, although the most developed versions of the car were restricted to factory-sanctioned teams only. \n\n250 TRs were extremely competitive during this time, winning 10 World Sportscar Championship races including the 1958, 1960, and 1961 24 Hours of Le Mans, the 1958, 1959 and 1961 12 Hours of Sebring, the 1958 Targa Florio, the 1958 and 1960 1000 km Buenos Aires and the 1961 4 hours of Pescara. Notable drivers included Phil Hill, Olivier Gendebien, Luigi Musso, Peter Collins, Dan Gurney, Wolfgang von Trips and Mike Hawthorne, among others.\n\nThe excellent results of 250 TRs and Scuderia Ferrari's skilled drivers earned Ferrari the 1958, 1960 and 1961 Constructor's World Sportscar Championship titles.\n\nThe Aston Martin DBR1 and the Porsche 718 were the 250 TR's closest competitors during this time. Stirling Moss drove a DBR1 to win first place against strong Ferrari opposition at the 1958 1000km Nürburgring, and DBR1s would go on to win over 250 TRs at the 1959 Le Mans, Nürburgring, and Tourist Trophy races, depriving Ferrari of the Constructor's World Championship in 1959.\n\nThe Tipo 128 Colombo-designed 3.0L V12 developed for the 250 Testa Rossa would continue to be used in Ferrari sports racing cars through the early 1960s. The 250 GTO, 250 P and 250 LM achieved racing success with this engine.\n\nExperimentation on 250 TR body styles from 1957 through 1962 provided Ferrari engineers with valuable experience in developing both low-drag and stability-promoting aerodynamic bodywork. The 250 GTO, SP sports racers, and 250/275/330 P were the immediate beneficiaries of this knowledge. \n\nFerrari named the 1984-1991 Testarossa road car as a homage to the 500 TR and 250 TR. In contrast to the front-engine V12-powered 250 TR, the Testarossa is a mid-engine design using a flat-12 engine and was designed as a road-going sports car, rather than a racer.\n\nThe 250 Testa Rossa is one of the most valuable vintage Ferraris (and therefore one of the most valuable cars of any type), due to their low production (33 total including all 250 TR variants), racing success and historical influence. The 250 GTO is generally considered to have a greater monetary value, although true market values are difficult to determine due to how seldom either model is sold at auction. 250 TRs are often seen at prestigious auto shows such as the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance and the Goodwood Festival of Speed.\n\nA 1957 250 TR (chassis 0714TR) sold for €9,020,000 at RM Sotheby's 2009 Maranello auction. The 1957 250 TR prototype (chassis 0666TR) sold for $16.39 million at the 2011 Gooding & Co Pebble Beach auction. 250 TR chassis 0704 reportedly sold privately in 2014 for $39.8 million. \n\nFashion designer Ralph Lauren's extensive auto collection contains two 250 TRs, a 1958 Scaglietti-bodied car (chassis 0734TR) and a 1961 250 TR/61 Spider Fantuzzi (chassis 0792TR).\n\nThe value, performance and historical significance ascribed to the 250 TR have motivated many individuals and companies to create reproduction automobiles. Sold as a \"replica\", \"recreation\" or \"reproduction\", these can vary widely in historical accuracy and sophistication, sometimes using Ferrari engines and chassis or simply attempting to replicate the body style of the original with unrelated mechanical underpinnings. Some of these reproductions have been unscrupulously represented as original, factory-built 250 TRs. \n\nAs 250 TR values rose, some extremely damaged or destroyed 250 TRs were reconstructed using varying amounts of newly fabricated or non-original components. In at least one instance, this has resulted in a case of disputed identity, whereby multiple reconstructed or reproduced cars lay claim to a particular factory chassis number.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1896271", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896271", "title": "Holonomic brain theory", "text": "Holonomic brain theory\n\nHolonomic brain theory is a branch of neuroscience investigating the idea that human consciousness is formed by quantum effects in or between brain cells. This is opposed by traditional neuroscience, which investigates the brain's behavior by looking at patterns of neurons and the surrounding chemistry, and which assumes that any quantum effects will not be significant at this scale. The entire field of quantum consciousness is often criticized as pseudoscience, as detailed on the main article thereof.\n\nThis specific theory of quantum consciousness was developed by neuroscientist Karl Pribram initially in collaboration with physicist David Bohm. It describes human cognition by modeling the brain as a holographic storage network. Pribram suggests these processes involve electric oscillations in the brain's fine-fibered dendritic webs, which are different from the more commonly known action potentials involving axons and synapses. These oscillations are waves and create wave interference patterns in which memory is encoded naturally, and the waves may be analyzed by a Fourier transform. Gabor, Pribram and others noted the similarities between these brain processes and the storage of information in a hologram, which can also be analyzed with a Fourier transform. In a hologram, any part of the hologram with sufficient size contains the whole of the stored information. In this theory, a piece of a long-term memory is similarly distributed over a dendritic arbor so that each part of the dendritic network contains all the information stored over the entire network. This model allows for important aspects of human consciousness, including the fast associative memory that allows for connections between different pieces of stored information and the non-locality of memory storage (a specific memory is not stored in a specific location, i.e. a certain cluster of neurons).\n\nIn 1946 Dennis Gabor invented the hologram mathematically, describing a system where an image can be reconstructed through information that is stored throughout the hologram. He demonstrated that the information pattern of a three-dimensional object can be encoded in a beam of light, which is more-or-less two-dimensional. Gabor also developed a mathematical model for demonstrating a holographic associative memory. One of Gabor's colleagues, Pieter Jacobus Van Heerden, also developed a related holographic mathematical memory model in 1963. This model contained the key aspect of non-locality, which became important years later when, in 1967, experiments by both Braitenberg and Kirschfield showed that exact localization of memory in the brain was false.\n\nKarl Pribram had worked with psychologist Karl Lashley on Lashley's engram experiments, which used lesions to determine the exact location of specific memories in primate brains. Lashley made small lesions in the brains and found that these had little effect on memory. On the other hand, Pribram removed large areas of cortex, leading to multiple serious deficits in memory and cognitive function. Memories were not stored in a single neuron or exact location, but were spread over the entirety of a neural network. Lashley suggested that brain interference patterns could play a role in perception, but was unsure how such patterns might be generated in the brain or how they would lead to brain function.\n\nSeveral years later an article by neurophysiologist John Eccles described how a wave could be generated at the branching ends of pre-synaptic axons. Multiple of these waves could create interference patterns. Soon after, Emmett Leith was successful in storing visual images through the interference patterns of laser beams, inspired by Gabor's previous use of Fourier transformations to store information within a hologram. After studying the work of Eccles and that of Leith, Pribram put forward the hypothesis that memory might take the form of interference patterns that resemble laser-produced holograms. Physicist David Bohm presented his ideas of holomovement and implicate and explicate order. Pribram became aware of Bohm's work in 1975 and realized that, since a hologram could store information within patterns of interference and then recreate that information when activated, it could serve as a strong metaphor for brain function. Pribram was further encouraged in this line of speculation by the fact that DeValois and DeValois established \"the spatial frequency encoding displayed by cells of the visual cortex was best described as a Fourier transform of the input pattern.\"\n\nA main characteristic of a hologram is that every part of the stored information is distributed over the entire hologram. Both processes of storage and retrieval are carried out in a way described by Fourier transformation equations. As long as a part of the hologram is large enough to contain the interference pattern, that part can recreate the entirety of the stored image, except with more unwanted changes, called noise.\n\nAn analogy to this is the broadcasting region of a radio antenna. In each smaller individual location within the entire area it is possible to access every channel, similar to how the entirety of the information of a hologram is contained within a part. Another analogy of a hologram is the way sunlight illuminates objects in the visual field of an observer. It doesn't matter how narrow the beam of sunlight is. The beam always contains all the information of the object, and when conjugated by a lens of a camera or the eyeball, produces the same full three-dimensional image. The Fourier transform formula converts spatial forms to spatial wave frequencies and vice versa, as all objects are in essence vibratory structures. Different types of lenses, acting similarly to optic lenses, can alter the frequency nature of information that is transferred.\n\nThis non-locality of information storage within the hologram is crucial, because even if most parts are damaged, the entirety will be contained within even a single remaining part of sufficient size. Pribram and others noted the similarities between an optical hologram and memory storage in the human brain. According to the holonomic brain theory, memories are stored within certain general regions, but stored non-locally within those regions. This allows the brain to maintain function and memory even when it is damaged. It is only when there exist no parts big enough to contain the whole that the memory is lost. This can also explain why some children retain normal intelligence when large portions of their brain—in some cases, half—are removed. It can also explain why memory is not lost when the brain is sliced in different cross-sections.\n\nPribram proposed that neural holograms were formed by the diffraction patterns of oscillating electric waves within the cortex. It is important to note the difference between the idea of a holonomic brain and a holographic one. Pribram does not suggest that the brain functions as a single hologram. Rather, the waves within smaller neural networks create localized holograms within the larger workings of the brain. This patch holography is called holonomy or windowed Fourier transformations.\n\nA holographic model can also account for other features of memory that more traditional models cannot. The Hopfield memory model has an early memory saturation point before which memory retrieval drastically slows and becomes unreliable. On the other hand, holographic memory models have much larger theoretical storage capacities. Holographic models can also demonstrate associative memory, store complex connections between different concepts, and resemble forgetting through \"lossy storage.\"\n\nIn classic brain theory the summation of electrical inputs to the dendrites and soma (cell body) of a neuron either inhibit the neuron or excite it and set off an action potential down the axon to where it synapses with the next neuron. However, this fails to account for different varieties of synapses beyond the traditional axodendritic (axon to dendrite). There is evidence for the existence of other kinds of synapses, including serial synapses and those between dendrites and soma and between different dendrites. Many synaptic locations are functionally bipolar, meaning they can both send and receive impulses from each neuron, distributing input and output over the entire group of dendrites.\n\nProcesses in this dendritic arbor, the network of teledendrons and dendrites, occur due to the oscillations of polarizations in the membrane of the fine-fibered dendrites, not due to the propagated nerve impulses associated with action potentials. Pribram posits that the length of the delay of an input signal in the dendritic arbor before it travels down the axon is related to mental awareness. The shorter the delay the more unconscious the action, while a longer delay indicates a longer period of awareness. A study by David Alkon showed that after unconscious Pavlovian conditioning there was a proportionally greater reduction in the volume of the dendritic arbor, akin to synaptic elimination when experience increases the automaticity of an action. Pribram and others theorize that, while unconscious behavior is mediated by impulses through nerve circuits, conscious behavior arises from microprocesses in the dendritic arbor.\n\nAt the same time, the dendritic network is extremely complex, able to receive 100,000 to 200,000 inputs in a single tree, due to the large amount of branching and the many dendritic spines protruding from the branches. Furthermore, synaptic hyperpolarization and depolarization remains somewhat isolated due to the resistance from the narrow dendritic spine stalk, allowing a polarization to spread without much interruption to the other spines. This spread is further aided intracellularly by the microtubules and extracellularly by glial cells. These polarizations act as waves in the synaptodendritic network, and the existence of multiple waves at once gives rise to interference patterns.\n\nPribram suggests that there are two layers of cortical processing: a surface structure of separated and localized neural circuits and a deep structure of the dendritic arborization that binds the surface structure together. The deep structure contains distributed memory, while the surface structure acts as the retrieval mechanism. Binding occurs through the temporal synchronization of the oscillating polarizations in the synaptodendritic web. It had been thought that binding only occurred when there was no phase lead or lag present, but a study by Saul and Humphrey found that cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus do in fact produce these. Here phase lead and lag act to enhance sensory discrimination, acting as a frame to capture important features. These filters are also similar to the lenses necessary for holographic functioning.\n\nWhile Pribram originally developed the holonomic brain theory as an analogy for certain brain processes, several papers (including some more recent ones by Pribram himself) have proposed that the similarity between hologram and certain brain functions is more than just metaphorical, but actually structural. Others still maintain that the relationship is only analogical. Several studies have shown that the same series of operations used in holographic memory models are performed in certain processes concerning temporal memory and optomotor responses. This indicates at least the possibility of the existence of neurological structures with certain holonomic properties. Other studies have demonstrated the possibility that biophoton emission (biological electrical signals that are converted to weak electromagnetic waves in the visible range) may be a necessary condition for the electric activity in the brain to store holographic images. These may play a role in cell communication and certain brain processes including sleep, but further studies are needed to strengthen current ones. Other studies have shown the correlation between more advanced cognitive function and homeothermy. Taking holographic brain models into account, this temperature regulation would reduce distortion of the signal waves, an important condition for holographic systems.\n\nPribram's holonomic model of brain function did not receive widespread attention at the time, but other quantum models developed since, including brain dynamics by Jibu & Yasue and Vitiello's dissipative quantum brain dynamics. Though not directly related to the holonomic model, they continue to move beyond approaches based solely in classic brain theory.\n\nIn 1969 scientists D. Wilshaw, O. P. Buneman and H. Longuet-Higgins proposed an alternative, non-holographic model that fulfilled many of the same requirements as Gabor's original holographic model. The Gabor model did not explain how the brain could use Fourier analysis on incoming signals or how it would deal with the low signal-noise ratio in reconstructed memories. Longuet-Higgin's correlograph model built on the idea that any system could perform the same functions as a Fourier holograph if it could correlate pairs of patterns. It uses minute pinholes that do not produce diffraction patterns to create a similar reconstruction as that in Fourier holography. Like a hologram, a discrete correlograph can recognize displaced patterns and store information in a parallel and non-local way so it usually will not be destroyed by localized damage. They then expanded the model beyond the correlograph to an associative net where the points become parallel lines arranged in a grid. Horizontal lines represent axons of input neurons while vertical lines represent output neurons. Each intersection represents a modifiable synapse. Though this cannot recognize displaced patterns, it has a greater potential storage capacity. This was not necessarily meant to show how the brain is organized, but instead to show the possibility of improving on Gabor's original model. P. Van Heerden countered this model by demonstrating mathematically that the signal-noise ratio of a hologram could reach 50% of ideal. He also used a model with a 2D neural hologram network for fast searching imposed upon a 3D network for large storage capacity. A key quality of this model was its flexibility to change the orientation and fix distortions of stored information, which is important for our ability to recognize an object as the same entity from different angles and positions, something the correlograph and association network models lack.\n\nHolographic models of memory and consciousness may be related to several brain disorders involving disunity of sensory input within a unified consciousness, including Charles Bonnet Syndrome, Disjunctive Agnosia, and Schizophrenia. Charles Bonnet Syndrome patients experience two vastly different worlds within one consciousness. They see the world that psychologically normal people perceive, but also a simplified world riddled with Pseudohallucination. These patients can differentiate these two worlds easily. Since dynamic core and global workspace theories insist that a distinct area of the brain is responsible for consciousness, the only way a patient would perceive two worlds was if this dynamic core and global workspace were split. But such does not explain how different content can be perceived within one single consciousness since these theories assume that each dynamic core or global workspace creates a single coherent reality. The primary symptom of Disjunctive Agnosia is an inconsistency of sensory information within a unified consciousness. They may see one thing, but hear something entirely incompatible with that image. Schizophrenics often report experiencing thoughts that do not seem to originate from themselves, as if the idea was inserted exogenously. The individual feels no control over certain thoughts existing within their consciousness.\n\n\n\n"}

It is a collection of six texts recounting a mix of her experiences of the Nazi Occupation of France, with fictional details. She said she had \"forgotten\" ever writing the diary in which she recorded her wartime experiences, but most critics believe that to be a deliberate attempt to confuse autobiography and fiction. Duras' work is often cited as part of the Nouveau Roman movement which tried to redefine traditional ideas about set categories of books, fiction, non-fiction, biography, autobiography, etc. \n\nIn the six texts that confuse time and location, she attempts to convey the idea of the destructive effect of war on individual identity. She suggests that to overcome the effects of war, all must \"share the crime\" of the Holocaust. She confuses the identities of the characters, including her own to show the similarities between heroes and villains, and suggests that such distinctions as well as those between collaborators and resistors during the Second World War are pointless. She underlines the fact that as humans, all share similar traits, emotions, vulnerability, violence, vindictiveness, solidarity, love and hate.\n"}
{"id": "1896284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896284", "title": "Daniel Pratt (eccentric)", "text": "Daniel Pratt (eccentric)\n\n\"General\" Daniel Pratt, Jr. (born April 11, 1809 in Prattville, Chelsea, Massachusetts; died June 21, 1887 in Boston) was an American itinerant speaker, author, performance artist, eccentric, and poet.\n\nPratt trained as a carpenter but abandoned this craft and wandered about the country doing freelance lecturing. He claimed to have walked over 200,000 miles, from Maine to the Dakotas, visiting 27 states and 16 Indian tribes. He was widely known as the \"Great American Traveler,\" which was how he referred to himself with his characteristic disdain for modesty. His visits to American colleges came to be regarded by the students almost as a regular feature of campus life.\n\nHe was often an appreciated and honored guest and speaker, though usually met with tongue-in-cheek praise. At times, though, his welcome came pre-worn-out, as when he rushed in on Leonard Bacon as he was entertaining guests at home, shook his hand and announced expectantly, \"I, Sir, am no less a man than Daniel Pratt – Daniel Pratt, Sir, the great American traveler!\" Dr. Bacon, unimpressed, replied, \"All right – Travel!\"\n\nPratt was a prolific and generous generator of ideas, but in spite of this was heard to complain that \"it was utterly impossible for him to talk fast enough to get out his ideas, so rapidly did they grow in his fertile brain.\"\n\nPratt lectured widely, not only on university campuses, but in town halls, churches, and wherever he could find an audience. He would attend meetings of many varieties, from religious ceremonies to city government meetings to women's suffrage conventions, with the hopes of being able to address the assembly.\n\nOne newspaper announcement from 1853 invited readers to \"a LECTURE on \"The Laws of Mind and Matter\", at the lecture-room of Hope Chapel… The Universe is a globe of laws, and the whole animate creation exists and is governed by them. There is an infinite power above them all, and manifested in different bodies, subject to the will of the Law giver of Nature. Ladies, free; gentlemen, 25 cents.\" Another, from 1864, advertised \"the Hon. DANIEL PRATT, the Great American Traveler and editor of the famous \"Gridiron\", and author of a work entitled the 'Beacon Light,' and candidate for the Presidency, on the power of Master Leading Mind and the War Equilibrium, interspersed with poetry and anecdotes, at the Apollo Rooms… Tickets admitting a gentleman and ladies, fifty cents. Single tickets twenty-five cents, to be had at the door on the evening of the oration.\"\n\nPratt would appear in \"threadbare coat,\" \"battered tall hat, seedy attire, and imperturbable solemnity of countenance\" and deliver his talk, \"characterized by a dazzling faculty for word-creation, a complete mastery of the non-sequitur, and a lambent humor.\" Afterwards, if there had been no admission price, he'd pass the hat.\n\nOne author remembers seeing Pratt on campus:\n\nThe students then nominated Pratt for the US presidency, and passed the hat to buy him a new pair of shoes and a meal.\n\nOne journalist recalled an occasion on which Pratt lost his notes but did not lose his composure:\n\nHis remarks were written in two-inch-caliber chirography on the reverse of a roll of wall-paper, which the orator unwrapped as he proceeded until he was almost lost to view in the billows of white. Once an unprincipled sophomore crept up behind him and touched a lighted match to the manuscript. For a moment the perpetual candidate resembled a plate in Fox's \"Book of Martyrs\"; but without the slightest change of expression he trampled out the flaming Vocabulary Laboratory and went on calmly…\n\nOnly partial transcripts of Pratt's lectures have been found, but many times they were referred to by title or subject in the popular press of the time. The \"Brooklyn Eagle\" considered \"Equilibrium\" to be Pratt's signature lecture topic. George H. Genzmer noted topics like \"The Four Kingdoms,\" \"The Harmony of the Human Mind,\" \"The Solar System,\" and \"The Vocabulaboratory of the World's History.\"\n\nA journalist paraphrased one of Pratt's lectures thus:\n\nGentlemen, I have come up through great tribulation. I am in possession of a vast profundity of knowledge on the sciences of the universe, that when written out and published will be worth thousands of millions of dollars to our nation. God has favored me physically and mentally from my birth. The time has come for the industrial and educational sciences to be represented at the head of the American Government. And I have been speaking over twenty-five years on different subjects, almost without pay. I have spoken thousands of times without one cent or a crumb of bread or a place to lay my head. I have also spoken over a hundred times since last June from New York City to Toledo, Ohio, and all the presidents of the railroads have paid me was one dollar and a half. Man is the architect of his own weal. My circular entitled 'The Pratt Intellectual Zenith' is progressing.\n\nBecause of his high self-regard and his eccentric subject matter and delivery, Pratt was often subjected to mockery, sometimes of a cruel nature. On one occasion during the U.S. Civil War, he was lecturing to a regiment of Union army troops, who slipped forged correspondence from Confederate president Jefferson Davis in his pockets. Pratt was arrested on charge of being a spy, sentenced to death in a mock trial, blindfolded, and \n\"shot\" by a dozen riflemen using blank cartridges.\n\nPratt periodically challenged the intellects of his day to debates. He once challenged William Lloyd Garrison and Wendell Phillips to a debate on \"the virtues of the Abolition Party and Political Platform.\" On another occasion he challenged Henry Ward Beecher, Edwin H. Chapin and Andrew Jackson Davis to a debate on \"which is the smartest man in all points of view.\" In April 1854, he shared the stage with an all-star cast of eccentrics, including Father Lamson and John S. Orr (\"The Angel Gabriel\") before an audience of thousands in Boston.\n\nPratt wrote a periodical, the \"Gridiron\", as a tribune for his considered opinions, and also published broadsides and a book or two. In 1852, he announced the publication of \"a work… on the glories and wonders of the universe, in map form.\" In 1882 \"The Tech\" — MIT's student newspaper – gave this description of Pratt's work:\n\nPratt witnessed the inauguration of five presidents, and is said to have believed that he himself had been elected president but defrauded of the office. He was a frequent presidential candidate. One of his abbreviated campaign platforms was printed as a letter-to-the-editor in 1855:\n\nFellow Citizens, As I am a Member of the Press, Editor, Author and Publisher and Candidate for the next President of the United States of America in 56, It is due the People, that I give them some idea, of my Political Platform, I am for the Constitution right or wrong, I know no East, west, north or South, but my country, the People, the whole, People. If it had not been for Emigration, America would be people by the Indians and the wild beasts, Emigrants has built up and inriched America, I am in favor of holding up our identity as an Nation, to all Nations in the world, to Nationalize all Nations who come under the stars and stripes of the American Flag. It will take eight years to right up, and set the broken limbs of the People who compose our Nation. I want a Lady, of talent, and a little money, who never was Married to address me, by Letter at the New York Post office, in good faith, all confidential. I challenge in good faith the Hon. George Law, to meet me in some good Hall in this City, to give the People an opportunity of Judging who is the most available man for the President of the U.S.A.\n\nPratt occasionally came into conflict with another Boston eccentric with presidential aspirations, George Washington Mellen. At one point, Mellen accused Pratt of accepting £250,000 from the Pope in preparations for raising a large army of insurgents to take on the United States government. Pratt responded to this slander by accusing Mellen with high treason.\n\nPratt spoke at the 22nd Anniversary of the founding of the American Anti-Slavery Society in 1856, as the \"New York Times\" reported:\n\nDaniel Pratt, Esq.… Let him that is sent of God preach. Listen, for I am not going to make a speech. In this great country the Government was founded by the people; it was founded by the people for the people; and I am for the laboring classes. I don't think it is right for man to enslave his fellow-man. It is to God and this great and glorious country's institutions that I owe my present high, exalted position. [Applause.] It is to it that I owe my many hair-breadth escapes, during my great travels and perils by land and sea and mountain. [Great applause.]\n\nA Gentleman on the Platform — I submit, Mr. President, \"Is\" the gentleman in order?\n\nThe President — I trust the audience will bear with this particular case. I think it will not last long. (Turning to Mr. Pratt) Please, Sir, to be as short as possible.\n\nMr. Daniel Pratt, (continuing) — I'll wind up with a poem. [Enthusiastic applause] But, perhaps, as my name has not been announced, some of you may not know who I am, and so I'd better tell you, so that you may know. I am Daniel Pratt, Esq., the great American traveler and independent candidate for the Presidency – and I won't flinch a hair, [Enthusiastic applause and a few hisses.] Now I'll read the poem, It is\n\nIn 1864, Pratt went to see President Lincoln at the White House, and \"left a roll of printed and written paper\" for the president to peruse. The president, busy with the duties of his office, did not understand what he had received and returned the papers to Pratt via a White House staffer, with instructions to receive no further papers. Pratt felt this insult sorely, as he, in spite of his regular campaigning to himself fill Lincoln's office, considered himself one of the president's most hard-working supporters. The newspapers from Washington reported the encounter in the most unflattering terms, saying that \"a crazy man had got into the White House, had harrangued the President, and had endeavored to convince that functionary that he (the crazy man) had been elected President in 1856.… [Guards] seized the intruder and bore him from the sight of the offended Executive.\"\n\nIn 1867, the students of Trinity College in Connecticut, in response to one of Pratt's speeches (which the papers described as \"a highly polished, scholarly affair, abounding in flowers of rhetoric and striking similes\"), unanimously nominated Pratt to run for the United States presidency. They nominated a favorite African-American janitor, \"Professor\" James Williams, as his running mate.\n\n\"Persistency finds its practical incarnation in the person of Pratt,\" the \"Brooklyn Eagle\" wrote, in an editorial endorsement of sorts of Pratt's 1867 campaign. \"[H]e has been nominated by over twenty colleges, and if he can only get the Electoral College, of which there is little doubt, he will be all right.\" Pratt eventually abandoned this campaign so as not to hurt the candidacy of Ulysses S. Grant.\n\nThe June 1870 \"Hamilton Literary Magazine\" reported:\n\nAmong the many trophies in the State Police Headquarters, in Boston, is a pewter pitcher, seized at a saloon on Causeway street, which is inscribed: \"Presented to Daniel Pratt, Jr., Chelsea, the Great American Traveller, Orator and Patriot; the Friend of Humanity, the Ladies, and a Free Country generally; the Defender of the Rich and Juicy, wherever found, and however bound. Testimonials from Citizens and Admirers, at Grove Hall, Dorchester, August 15, 1845.\n\nGeorge H. Genzmer wrote that Pratt was \"the most widely known and affectionately remembered man of his class, the subject of innumerable anecdotes, reminiscences, rhymes, and allusions. This fame he owed in large measure to his devotion to the New England colleges, where … by the students he was received with an enthusiasm that quickly permeated the community and mounted to a height of ebullient demonstration scarcely distinguishable from a riot.… An impressive but quite unofficial convocation at Dartmouth College conferred on him the degree of C.O.D.\"\n\nA poem in Pratt's honor has been preserved, though its context does not indicate who composed it and hints that it may have been Pratt himself:\n\n<poem>\nOh, where is the man so lean and fat\nWho has not heard of Daniel Pratt,\nWho gathers his wings and flies away\nTo parts of earth were the light of day\nShines but a little or not at all\nIn the course of the awful waterfall?\nI ask you, friends, what muddy minds\nHave never conceived, unfurled to the winds\nThat glorious banner that springs like a cat\nInto the air for Daniel Pratt.\nThere never was nor ever will be\nSuch a mighty man to stand like thee,\nI say, most magnificent Daniel Pratt,\nAbove the throne where Plato sat!\n</poem>\n\n\n"}

Being detected, he fled in order to escape punishment, but returned when Athenion (or Aristion), a bitter opponent of the Romans, had made himself tyrant of the city with the aid of Mithradates. Athenion sent him with some troops to Delos, to plunder the treasures of the temple, but he showed little military capacity. He was surprised by the Romans under the command of Orobius (or Orbius), and only saved his life by flight. He died a little later, probably in 84 BC.\n\nApellicon's chief pursuit was the collection of rare and important books. He purchased from the family of Neleus of Scepsis in the Troad manuscripts of the works of Aristotle and Theophrastus (including their libraries), which had been given to Neleus by Theophrastus himself, whose pupil Neleus had been. They had been concealed in a cellar to prevent their falling into the hands of the book-collecting princes of Pergamon, and were in a very dilapidated condition. Apellicon was a lover of books rather than a philosopher; trying to restore the damaged copies he made new ones, filling up the lacunae incorrectly, and published them full of mistakes. In 84 Sulla removed Apellicon's library to Rome. Here the manuscripts were handed over to the grammarian Tyrannion of Amisus, who took copies of them, on the basis of which the peripatetic philosopher Andronicus of Rhodes prepared an edition of Aristotle's works.\n\nApellicon of Teos was a very rich individual who had bought up the library of Aristotle amongst many other books when he was a Peripatetic philosopher — other sources inform us that he was a mint magistrate under Athenion, tyrant of Athens. Apellicon, furthermore, secretly acquired — that is, stole — the original documents from the Athenian Metroon, the building that housed the city’s public documents. Particularly significant in this passage is the precedence given to Aristotle’s books, one that eclipses other writing and documents acquired by the Peripatetic. Considering that Apellicon appears to have been something of a rogue from sources, there is reason to believe that he may have fabricated the account of how he acquired the library in order to enhance its reputation.\n\nApellicon's library contained a remarkable old copy of the \"Iliad\". He is said to have published a biography of Aristotle, in which the calumnies of other biographers were refuted.\n\n"}
{"id": "1896302", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896302", "title": "Battle of Lena", "text": "Battle of Lena\n\nThe Battle of Lena occurred on January 31, 1208, and probably took place near Kungslena, which is located in the Tidaholm Municipality in Västergötland, Sweden. It was an important battle between the Danish-backed King Sverker II of Sweden and Prince Eric. Eric's forces imposed a crushing victory; however in July 1210, Sverker returned with a second army and was killed in the Battle of Gestilren.\n\nThe period 1150–1250 saw a strong rivalry between the House of Sverker and House of Eric who alternated on the Swedish throne. The main representative of the House of Eric, Eric Knutsson, returned from exile in Norway in 1207–08. There were marital connections between his family and the Norwegian ruling elite, but the sparse sources do not tell if he was backed by Norwegian troops. Sverker II was forced to flee to Denmark where he had been raised before becoming king. All this suggests that a large part of the Swedish nobility rejected Sverker's rule.\n\nSverker's kinsman, King Valdemar the Victorious of Denmark provided Sverker with auxiliaries, including a Czech contingent from Valdemar's father-in-law, the King Ottokar I of Bohemia. The bulk of the troops, however, were gathered by Sverker's in-laws, the powerful Sunesen brothers. The army was led by Ebbe Sunesen, brother of Archbishop Andreas Sunesen. Medieval traditions estimate the size of the force at 12,000 or 18,000, although these numbers might be vastly exaggerated.\n\nThe defending Swedish force was, again according to later tradition, half of that of Sverker's forces, numbering between 7,000 and 10,000. It is often assumed that Erik's army was made up in part by Norwegian auxiliaries. This has been questioned by Norwegian historian P.A. Munch, who considered it unlikely that Eric's ally, Jarl Håkon Galen, would have had any troops to spare during the ongoing Norwegian civil wars.\n\nThe invading army entered Västergötland in the middle of the winter. Frozen lakes and rivers may in fact have facilitated transportation of the troops. They met their adversary at Lena on January 31, 1208. No contemporary sources describe the battle in detail. We only know that the Danish troops suffered a crushing defeat, and that Ebbe Sunesen and his brother Laurentius were killed. The Icelandic Flateyarbók states that \"Junker Eric slew Ebbe Sunesen\", possibly implying a personal meeting on the battlefield. Knut Jarl of the House of Bjälbo was killed as well, probably on the Swedish side. Also killed in the melée was a Magnus, possibly Knut Jarl's uncle Magnus Minniskiöld, father of Birger Jarl. Perhaps the Swedes used the winter weather to their advantage, as the Danish knights were slow and vulnerable in heavy snow.\n\nLater Swedish and Danish tradition, while not reliable, bears witness of the impression that the cataclysmic battle made on posterity. A Swedish verse depicted the event as a plain battle between Sweden and Denmark: \"It happened in Lena / Two Danes ran for one (Swede) / And from the Swedish men / Received a bad spanking on their backs\". A Danish folksong emphasizes the sorry internal Swedish conditions, as kinsmen fought each other: \"It was ill to stand in the fighting / As the son let his father down\". A song alleges that no more than 55 men escaped the bloodbath and made it back to Denmark:\n\nThe Swedes won, according to legend, aided by Odin. The Norwegian \"Saga of Inge Bårdsson\" relates that a horseman arrived to the farmstead of a smith at Nesje on 26 January, and stayed over night. The next morning the stranger baffled the smith through a display of supernatural powers, then said: \"I have been to the north, and stayed in Norway for a long time, but I will now move over to Sweden.\" He then disclosed to the smith that he was Odin, spurred his horse, and jumped over a high fence out in the blue. Four days after this event, the Battle of Lena took place.\n\nAmong the few survivors was Sverker II who fled to Denmark. The Pope took interest in the cause of the fallen king and ordered Eric Knutsson to settle the matter and return kingship to Sverker. When Eric declined to meet these demands, Sverker returned from his Danish refuge with a new army. This second invasion ended with the Battle of Gestilren in July 1210. This time Sverker himself was killed, an event that secured the throne for King Eric.\n"}

The group was originally known as the New York chapter of the Prairie Fire Organizing Committee (PFOC), an organization devoted to legally promoting the causes of the Weather Underground. This was part of the Prairie Fire Manifesto's change in Weather Underground Organization strategy, which demanded both aboveground mass movements and clandestine organizations. The role of the clandestine organization would be to build the \"consciousness of action\" and prepare the way for the development of a people's militia. Concurrently, the role of the mass movement (i.e., above ground Prairie Fire Collective) would include support for, and encouragement of, armed action. Such an alliance would, according to Weather, \"help create the 'sea' for the guerrillas to swim in.\" The M19CO name was derived from the birthdays of Ho Chi Minh and Malcolm X. The May 19 Communist Organization was active from 1978 to 1985. M19CO was a combination of the Black Liberation Army and the Weather Underground. It also included members of the Black Panthers and the Republic of New Africa (RNA).\nIn addition to the May 19th Communist Organization being made up of the Black Liberation Army, the group was formed because of infighting in the Weather Underground Organization. Following the split of the Weather Underground Organization into factions, the faction that favored more extreme actions to achieve its objectives joined the Black Liberation Army, forming the May 19th Communist Organization. One of the founders, Laura Whitehorn, was also part of the Weather Underground Organization's predecessor, the Students for a Democratic Society. In addition to being known as the May 19th Communist Organization and the New York chapter of the Prairie Fire Organizing Committee, the group was also known as the Armed Resistance Movement, the Red Guerilla Resistance, Resistance Conspiracy, and Revolutionary Fighting Group. Despite these other monikers, the group was most popularly known as the May 19th Communist Organization, predicated on the Communist Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh's birthday.\n\nMembers of the May 19th Communist Organization, even when showing support for the group's goals of ridding the United States of racism, police brutality, and insufficient public housing, were often accused of not being fervent enough about the causes that the group pursued.\n\nThis alliance between the Weather Underground and the Black Liberation Army had three objectives:\n\nFrom 1982 to 1985 M19CO committed a series of bombings, including bombings of the National War College, the Washington Navy Yard Computing Center, the Israeli Aircraft Industries Building, New York City's South African consulate, the Washington Navy Yard Officers' Club, New York City's Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, and the United States Capitol Building. Three officers were killed during the Brinks Robbery, but no one was injured or killed in their bombings.\nAlmost all the M19CO members were convicted in a US Court of Law for these offenses, but Elizabeth Ann Duke remains at large.\n\n\nBy May 23, 1985, all members of the group had been arrested, with the exception of Elizabeth Duke, who remains a fugitive. Alleged rioter Donna Joan Borup was arrested but failed to appear at trial and is currently on the FBI Most Wanted Terrorist list. Donna Borup \"is thought to have a photographic memory and is highly intelligent,\" according to the FBI.\n\nMarilyn Jean Buck was arrested in 1985 and was, prior to joining the May 19th Communist Organization, the only white member of the Black Liberation Army, one of the two groups that formed the May 19thCommunist Organization. While the May 19th Communist Organization was made up of individuals of several racial heritages, the Black Liberation Army was previously entirely made up of black Americans, save for Marilyn Jean Buck.\n\nOn October 20th, 1981, Judith Clark was arrested in connection to the attack on the armored Brinks truck. Clark was the spokesperson of the May 19th Communist Organization as of 1978, and was previously a member of one of the May 19th Communist Organization's predecessor groups, the Prairie Fire Organizing Committee. Judith Clark is eligible for parole and is scheduled to be released from jail on May 15th, 2019, 37 years after she was arrested on the same day as the robbery of the armored Brinks truck.\n\nThe May 19th Communist Organization, along with other domestic terrorist organizations like the United Freedom Front and the Aryan Nations, are noted as having advanced the FBI's strategy and capacity to investigate domestic terrorism in the United States.\n\nFollowing Congressional hearings in the mid-1970s, the FBI's capacity for surveillance of domestic terrorist groups was curtailed due to alleged overreach.< This rollback on the FBI's ability to gather intelligence allowed the May 19th Communist Organization and the United Freedom Front to conduct terror attack in the late 1970s, which garnered a renewed support for the FBI's ability to gather intelligence about domestic terrorist organizations in order to prevent future attacks.\n\nIn 1982, FBI director William H. Webster reported to the Senate Subcommittee on Security and Terrorism that the Justice Department was relaxing rules that allowed the FBI to keep surveillance on domestic terrorist groups, inspired by the actions of the May 19th Communist Organization, as well as the Socialist Workers Party, the Progressive Labor Party, and the May 19th Communist Organization's predecessor group, the Weather Underground Organization. These new guidelines were aimed at repressing domestic terrorist organizations while not curtailing legitimate political protest and dissent.\n\nFrancis McNamara, former executive secretary of the House Committee on Un-American Activities, allegedly sought a return to McCarthy-era politics, surveilling Americans who were involved in communist or left-wing organizations, and allowing these political views to deem the May 19th Communist Organization a terrorist group following the 1981 robbery of an armored Brinks truck perpetrated by members of the May 19th Communist Organization.\n\n"}

Expansion continued in the 1980s and in 1989 the final house of the original plan was completed, 23 years after building had begun and 15 years after its planned completion. The population was at that time over 5000.\n\nIts name originated from the fact that it was built along an old Roman Road that had a Toll Bar/gate (the \"Bar\" part) which was used in the local area as the farm's name, Bar Farm. The farm house still remains next to the village school. The toll gate was also located roughly near this building. The village was built on or around one of the many hills in the area, hence the name \"Bar Hill\". It is accessible on the B1050 road, off A14 exit 29.\n\nOn 8 August 2014 the village came to national prominence when over 100mm of rain fell in a period of approximately 30 minutes causing many parts of the village to become flooded.\n\nThe village has a shopping mall (with a large Tesco Extra supermarket as anchor store), library (in which, unusually, a post office is also located), primary school, multi-denominational church (rebuilt in 1991) and a pub called The Fox. A skate park was built in the village but has largely been demolished. There is also a championship 18 hole golf course and hotel. The village also has two fields (one large field known to locals mostly as \"The village green\" and the smaller school playing field located near the farmhouse) which are used to host sporting events and council events such as the annual village féte.\n\nIt has a cycle path to Dry Drayton, known as The Drift. There is also a footpath that leads to the small village of Lolworth.\n\nBar Hill was originally contained within a ring road when it was first developed, but with the expansion and development of the area, it began to spill out. For example the \"Gleneagles\" development overlooking the golf course.\n\nIn 2017, Bar Hill was one of many areas that started to be affected by the A14 road (England) Cambridge to Huntingdon Improvement Scheme which is set for completion at the end of 2020.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1896329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896329", "title": "Desanka Maksimović", "text": "Desanka Maksimović\n\nDesanka Maksimović (, ; 16 May 1898 – 11 February 1993) was a Serbian poet, writer and translator. Her first works were published in the literary journal \"Misao\" in 1920, while she was studying at the University of Belgrade. Within a few years, her poems appeared in the \"Srpski knjizevni glasnik\" (Serbian Literary Herald), Belgrade's most influential literary publication. In 1925, Maksimović earned a French Government scholarship for a year's study at the University of Paris. Upon her return, she was appointed a professor at Belgrade's elite First High School for Girls, a position she would hold continuously until World War II.\n\nIn 1933, Maksimović married Sergej Slastikov, a Russian émigré writer. After being dismissed from her post at the high school by the Germans in 1941, she was reduced to a state of poverty and forced to work odd jobs to survive the three-year occupation. She was only permitted to publish children's literature during this period, but secretly compiled a collection of patriotic poems, which were not published until after the war. Among these was \"Krvava bajka\" (A Bloody Fairy Tale), which is about the Wehrmacht's killing of schoolchildren in the Kragujevac massacre. It was recited extensively in post-war commemorative ceremonies and became one of the best known Serbian-language poems.\n\nTo mark her 60th birthday, Maksimović was named the recipient of a string of honours and awards in 1958. In 1964, she published one of her most acclaimed works, a volume of reflective poetry entitled \"Tražim pomilovanje\" (I Seek Clemency). The work's veiled critique of the Tito government made it especially popular. The following year, she became a full-fledged member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts. Following her husband's death in 1970, Maksimović's poetry increasingly began to revolve around the subject of human mortality. Maksimović travelled extensively in the 1970s and 1980s, and some of her visits abroad inspired several of her works. She became involved in efforts to combat government censorship in the early 1980s and was active until her death in 1993.\n\nMaksimović was the first female Serbian poet to gain widespread acceptance within Yugoslav literary circles and among the general public. One literary scholar notes that she served as an example for other Serbian women wishing to take up the craft. Maksimović's reputation, which was such that most of her contemporaries referred to her simply by her first name, has led one author to describe her as \"the most beloved Serbian poet of the twentieth century\".\n\nDesanka Maksimović was born in the village of Rabrovica, near Valjevo, on 16 May 1898. She was the oldest of her parent's seven children. Her father Mihailo was a schoolteacher and her mother Draginja (\"née\" Petrović) was a housewife. Maksimović's ancestors had migrated to Serbia from Herzegovina in the late 18th century. Her maternal grandfather was an Eastern Orthodox priest. Within two months of her birth, her father was reassigned to the nearby village of Brankovina, and the family had to relocate. Maksimović spent much of her early childhood in Brankovina. She took an interest in reading at an early age, spending hours in her father's library. When she was 10, the family moved to Valjevo. Maksimović's family was devastated by World War I. In 1915, she lost her father to typhus while he was serving in the Royal Serbian Army. Her father's death thrust the family into difficult financial straights. In order to be able to take care of her mother and her siblings, Maksimović was forced to drop out of high school. In her free time, she learned French. She re-enrolled after the war and completed her secondary education in 1919.\n\nUpon completing high school, Maksimović moved to Belgrade, the capital of the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. She enrolled in the University of Belgrade, and took courses in art history and comparative literature. By this time, Maksimović had been writing verse for a number of years. She gave some of her poems to one of her former professors, who in turn gave them to Velimir Masuka, the editor-in-chief of \"Misao\" (Thought), one of Serbia's leading artistic and literary publications.\n\nMaksimović's poetry first appeared in \"Misao\" between 1920 and 1921. She received what was to be the first of many literary awards when one of her poems was voted to be the journal's best by its readers. Within a few years, the \"Srpski književni glasnik\" (Serbian Literary Herald), then Belgrade's most influential and respected literary journal, began printing her poems, and several of her works appeared in an anthology of Yugoslav lyric poetry. In 1924, Maksimović published her first poetry collection, simply entitled \"Pesme\" (Poems). The collection was met with positive reviews. Maksimović graduated from the University of Belgrade around this time and received a fellowship from the Government of France for a year's study at the University of Paris. She returned to Belgrade in 1925, and upon her return, received a Saint Sava medal from the government for her literary achievements and became a professor at the city's elite First High School for Girls.\n\nBy the late 1920s, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was mired by ethnic tensions. In 1929, King Alexander decreed that it be renamed Yugoslavia to mitigate growing nationalist resentment. Before long, the country's political disputes spilled over into literary discourse. Yugoslav writers could not agree on the political and artistic direction Yugoslav literature should take. Older writers favoured abiding by existing literary norms while younger ones promoted modernism as a means of explaining the contradictions of modern life and exploring the human subconscious. Maksimović's steadfast refusal to deviate from traditional literary forms and traditions prompted scathing critiques from many of her colleagues in the Yugoslav literary establishment. She would later note: \"I would not have had as many friends as I have now if I had not been able to forget the biting jokes or critical remarks about my poetry or myself.\" Yugoslavia had to endure difficult economic conditions during the Great Depression and the country's political landscape deteriorated further. During this time, Maksimović made poetry the main focus of her writing. Many of her poems were first recited before her fellow writers in the home of Smilja Đaković, the publisher of \"Misao\". In 1933, Maksimović married a Russian-born writer named Sergej Slastikov.\n\nFollowing the German-led Axis invasion and subsequent occupation of Yugoslavia, Maksimović was forcibly retired from her teaching position at the First High School for Girls at the behest of the occupational authorities. Impoverished, she resorted to giving private lessons, sowing children's clothes and selling dolls in the marketplace. In order to heat her apartment, Maksimović had to walk from downtown Belgrade to Mount Avala to collect firewood. She wrote patriotic poems in secret during this time but was only allowed to publish children's books.\n\nAfter the war, Yugoslavia became a socialist state under the leadership of Josip Broz Tito. Maksimović was reinstated as a professor at the First High School for Girls. In 1946, she published a collection of war poems titled \"Pesnik i zavičaj\" (The Poet and His Native Land). The collection contained one of her best known poems, \"Krvava bajka\" (A Bloody Fairy Tale), a requiem for the children killed in the Kragujevac massacre of October 1941. Although she was not a communist, her works received the approval of the Yugoslav government. Maksimović was a fervent Russophile, and at times, her Russophilia was mistaken for covert Cominformism, a serious charge in the years following the Tito–Stalin Split, that if proven, could have landed a person in prison. Maksimović retired from teaching in 1953. In 1958, to mark her 60th birthday, Maksimović received a number of awards from the Yugoslav government and literary establishment. The following year, she received partial membership in the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU).\n\nIn 1964, Maksimović published a volume of reflective poetry entitled \"Tražim pomilovanje\" (I Seek Clemency), which dealt with the 14th-century reign of Dušan the Mighty, the founder of the Serbian Empire. The collection was well received and quickly became a bestseller. Its veiled critique of Tito made it especially popular, especially among those frustrated with the Yugoslav government's increasing arbitrariness and corruption. Maksimović was the recipient of further honours over the next several years. In 1965, her colleagues voted to make her a full member of the SANU. By this time, Maksimović was not only well known and respected within Yugoslavia, but also abroad, with her works having been translated into dozens of languages. Among the translators of her works was the Russian poet Anna Akhmatova. In 1967, Maksimović was awarded a medal by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.\n\nMaksimović's husband died in 1970. Following his death, her poems increasingly began to deal with the topic of human mortality. In 1975, she received a Vuk Karadžić Award for Lifetime Achievement from the SANU, becoming only the second writer to receive the honour, after Nobel laureate Ivo Andrić. The following year, Maksimović published \"Letopis Perunovih potomaka\" (A Chronicle of Perun's Descendants), a poetry collection dealing with medieval Balkan history. She travelled widely in the 1970s and 1980s, visiting many European nations, including the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, but also Australia, Canada, the United States, and China. Her visits to Norway and Switzerland inspired the poetry collection \"Pesme iz Norveške\" (Poems from Norway; 1976) and a travel book titled \"Snimci iz Švajcarske\" (Snapshots from Switzerland; 1978). In 1982, Maksimović became one of the founding members of the Committee for the Protection of Artistic Freedom, which sought an end to government censorship. In 1988, she published a poetry collection titled \"Pamtiću sve\" (I Shall Remember Everything). She died in Belgrade on 11 February 1993, aged 94.\n\n\"Maksimović ... marked a whole era with her lyrical poetry,\" the literary scholar Aida Vidan writes. She was the first female Serbian poet to gain widespread acceptance from her predominantly male colleagues within the Yugoslav literary milieu, as well as the first Serbian female poet to attract a significant following among the general public. She was Yugoslavia's leading female literary figure for seven decades, first acquiring this distinction during the interwar period and retaining it until her death. The scholar Dubravka Juraga describes her as \"the beloved doyenne of Yugoslav \"belles lettres\"\". Maksimović \"offered women writers a model of achievement in the field of lyric poetry,\" the literary scholar Celia Hawkesworth writes. Hawkesworth compares Maksimović's contributions to Serbian literature to that of Elisaveta Bagriana in Bulgaria, Wisława Szymborska in Poland, and Nina Cassian in Romania. The author Christopher Deliso describes Maksimović as \"the most beloved Serbian poet of the twentieth century\". During her lifetime, her reputation was such that many of her contemporaries referred to her simply by her first name. Her poem \"Krvava bajka\" is widely considered one of the best known pieces of Serbian-language verse. She is also credited with popularizing love locks in the former Yugoslavia through one of her poems. By the early 2000s, the phenomenon had spread to other parts of the globe.\n\nA statue of Maksimović was unveiled in Valjevo on 27 October 1990, while she was still alive. In the 1990s, as part of the renaming of communist-era street names following the breakup of Yugoslavia, Đuro Salaj Street in Belgrade was renamed Desanka Maksimović Street. In May 1996, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia issued a commemorative postage stamp in her honour. A bronze statue of Maksimović was erected in Belgrade's Tašmajdan Park on 23 August 2007.\n\nSource: \n\n"}

Edwards came to Edmonton about a year and a half ago from Peterboro, Ont., where he was born and spent his\nearly life. He is a graduate of Toronto University with the degrees of M.A. and LL.B. He was admitted to the bar of\nOntario and practiced law with W.E. Scott brothers of Mr. Justice Scott, of Alberta. For twenty years he was city solicitor\nof Peterboro, a city which is now sixth in the Dominion for manufacturing output, and has thus a close insight into the\nmanagement of municipal affairs. Colonel Edwards is now brigadier of the 7th Infantry with headquarters at Kingston. This\nbattalion comprised the 14th, 46th 47th, 49th and 57th regiments. He is a past president of the Ontario Curling Association, one of the largest sporting organizations in the world. He was chairman of the special committee which received the touring\nScotch curlers in Ontario two years ago. He has also occupied the office of commodore of the American Canoe Association.\n\nMilitary Matters 24 Apr 1909N04P0767\nEdmonton Bulletin\n24 Apr 1909\nN04P0767\n\nMILITARY MATTERS\n\nDuring the past year there has been a marked increase in the interest taken in military matters in Edmonton and the next few months should see even greater activity in military circles, not only in this city, but throughout the whole of western Canada. The Dominion government has been hampered by lack of funds in their efforts to raise military units in the west. They have done good work in this respect in the past and are every year making many, much-needed improvements. This is a new country, however, and a pretty extensive one and it takes time to introduce all the modern conveniences and equipment so necessary to the maintenance of an ideal volunteer military system in the west. Officers and men who have been connected with military organizations in eastern Canada and in the old country realize to the fullest extant the difficulties under which they are laboring in the west and it speaks volumes for their patriotism and deep interest in the work of establishing a creditable volunteer system that they almost invariably take hold in a whole-hearted manner and endeavor to surmount the obstacles. There are dozens of examples of this right here in Edmonton, and it is due largely to the efforts of such men that Edmonton is now the centre for two first class military units.\n\nThe outstanding feature in the military world of Edmonton during the past year has been the organization of a new infantry regiment known as the 101st Edmonton Fusiliers. Lt. Colonel Edwards is in command of this new regiment and is very enthusiastic over the way the organization work has been carried forward. He has associated with him an excellent staff of officers with considerable knowledge of military affairs. They are all very enthusiastic and are energetically carrying forward the work.\n\nShortly after the organization of the 101st had been authorized classes were opened in the city for officers and non-commissioned officers. These were continued for six weeks and were well attended. Thirty three officers and twenty-six non-coms. qualified and obtained certificates. They were assigned to the eight companies of the regiment as follows:—A Co.—Captain Osborne, Lieutenants Flint, Meneeley and Brown, Sergeants Gillespie, Ritchie, LeBlanc and Mohr.\nB Co.—Captain Weeks, Lieutenants Mulvey and Morris, Sergeants Gregory, Brunlees, Sherwood and Dredge.\nC Co.—Captain Harwood, Lieutenants Keefer, Delevault and Powley, Sergeants McRae, Hodson and Berry.\nD Co.—Captain Anderson, Lieutenants Crumb and McDonald, Sergeant Adams.\nE Co.—Captain Fisher, Lieutenants Bradburn, Stewart and Rix, Sergeants Balfour, Davies and Wilson.\nF Co.—Captain Carpenter, Lieutenants Stark, Higman, Spratt and Chadwick, Sergeants Weaver, Campbell and McDonald.\nG Co.—Captain Strong, Lieutenants McKenzie, Bellamy and Gorman, Sergeants Howland, Hawkins and Claassen.\nH Co.—Captain McLeod, Lieutenants Gillespie, Whittaker and Kelly, Sergeants Baty, E. J. Hazard, Porter and B. Hassard.\n\nNo attempt was made until very recently to enroll the rank and file of the regiment. Recruiting has been carried forward during the past month however and fully one half of the total strength of the regiment has been enrolled.\n\nThe total strength of the regiment will be 405, of whom 33 are officers and 372 non-commissioned officers and men. The formation of a regimental band with a total strength of 25 has been authorized. It is probable that arrangements will be made for the Citizens' band to become the regimental band. A signal corps will be formed consisting of two men from each company. A supernumerary lieutenant of each company has been appointed to fill any vacancies which might occur.\n\nIn the first 150 enrolled in the 101st, over one-third have been members of military organizations in eastern Canada or the old country, and a number have seen active service in South Africa.\n\nA splendid class of men are being enrolled. A large number of these still retain the accent of bonny Scotland. There are a number from Ireland, several having been members of the famous Royal Irish Constabulary. England and Eastern Canada furnish a large number. There are a few Americans and French and two or three Ruthenians. The minimum height of the men enrolled in the 101st has been fixed at 5 feet, 7 inches. The standard minimum height for militiamen in England and elsewhere is 5 feet, 4 inches. In Canada the minimum height of the Governor General's Foot Guards has also been placed at 5 feet, 7 inches. The number of men enrolled in the 101st who are 5 feet, 10 and 11 inches, and even 6 feet high, is surprisingly large.\n\nD Company is being recruited in Strathcona, and drill is held there. Regular drill is being held in the city twice a week, on Tuesday and Friday evenings. A number of the companies are also holding extra drills. Drill is being held at the Separate school hall at the present time, but as soon as the evenings lengthen open air drill will be commenced possibly on the exhibition grounds or Hudson Bay flats.\nA bugle band is being organized in connection with the regiment. Allowance in age and height is being made for buglers. A number of young fellows who have a taste for this are required to complete the bugle band.\n\nAlthough there are now two strong military organizations in the city there is still no armory. The militia department planned to erect a large armory here this summer, but up to the present the appropriation required for this purpose has not been authorized.\nThe 101st Fusiliers are endeavoring to secure temporary quarters in the curling rink and the waiting room is being used at the present time for the quartermaster's stores. If the rink is secured, as is expected, it will mean that a number of rooms will be built along the west side of the building on the space occupied in the past by the No. 4 loe. Eight rooms for the companies in the regiment will be built and also a band room, quarter master's store room, buglers' room and a sergeants' room. The officers will use the present waiting room and the room above it.\n\nA large quantity of equipment for the new regiment has been received. Sixteen large cases of clothing have arrived and are being issued. Three hundred and seventy-two Ross rifles have also arrived, which with the 75 used in the training school will be used for drill. The clothing received included serge jacket and trousers, a set of blue linen for fatigue dress, a full dress tunic, peak caps of a naval pattern, helmets for ceremonial drill and warm weather work, and chevrons and badges for the staff sergeants, sergeants, corporals, bandsmen and buglers.\n\nRifle practice at the ranges is going to prove a very attractive part of the drill this summer. The ranges are located on the south bank of the river and some little distance east. They will be put in proper condition at the earliest possible moment. A ferry will be installed on the river opposite the ranges as soon as the ice on the river goes out and rifle shooting should become very popular this year. In the 101st there are already a large number of expert shots, and they will not only be able to make a good showing for themselves, but will be able to instruct new men.\n\nThe 101st is the first Canadian regiment to be armed throughout with the mark 2 Ross rifle. These rifles have been declared by experts to be far superior to the old rifles used. One of the great advantages is the low trajectory of the rifle. With the old Snyder-Enfield rifle a man on a load of hay could drive midway between the marksman and a 500-yard target, provided his head was not more than 26 feet from the ground, and be uninjured. With the Ross rifle, however, a man 5 feet 6 inches in height, crossing between the marksman and target at the 500 yard range would be in danger of being shot through the neck. The muzzle velocity of the mark 2 Ross rifle is 200 feet per second greater than any other rifle. The variations in elevation are not so great and the bullet as a consequence, is less affected by the wind.\n\nThere was a large attendance at drill last night, some of the companies taking their first out-of-door drill. The following regimental orders by Lieut. Col. E. B. Edwards, commanding the 101st regiment, with headquarters at Edmonton, were read:\n1—To be orderly officer for the week ending, April 24, Captain F. A. Osborne; next for duty, Captain W. S. Weeks.\n2—To be battalion orderly sergeant for the week ending April 24, Color Sergeant Howland; next for duty, Color Sergeant Weaver.\n3—To be orderly bugler, E. Baty.\nThe names of the men enrolled up to the present were read.\n\nThe coming summer promises to be an active one also for the 19th Alberta Mounted Rifles with headquarters at Edmonton. This regiment will be stronger than ever this year. In Edmonton, which is the headquarters for A squadron, many new men are being enrolled. They are a better class than formerly and are picking up the drill very rapidly.\n\nA few months ago arrangements were made whereby A squadron would commence drill. All Saints school room was secured for this purpose and every Tuesday evening rifle and bayonet drill was held. A large number of new men joined the squadron and entered enthusiastically into the work of reorganization. Interesting lectures were delivered on military topics throughout the winter and it is the intention to hold a number of smokers and social functions in order to keep the men together. New uniforms have been ordered for the men and are expected to arrive at an early date.\n\nThe 19th is laboring under the same difficulties as the 101st through lack of a suitable armory or proper equipment. A squadron armory is located on Eighth street, but the officers and men will all gladly welcome the erection of a new and up-to-date armory in the city.\n\nThe mounted regiments in the west go into camp every year for two weeks during the summer. This year camp opens on June 29, two weeks later than in former years. In this way it is hoped to escape much of the wet weather. The place of the camp has not yet been definitely decided. It is possible that brigade camp for military district No. 13 will be held in Calgary again this year. The 19th A. M. R., however, may hold regimental camp at Edmonton. An effort is being made to hold brigade camp here in the future. It is now three years since a training camp was held in Edmonton. Six weeks training school will be held at Edmonton prior to camp.\n\nArmy signalling will likely be pushed forward briskly in the city this year as both the 101st and the 19th are planning to raise signal corps. Sergeant Major Hopkins, of A squadron, 19th A. M. R., has been appointed supernumerary lieutenant and will have charge of the signal corps. Recruits for the 19th signal corps are now being called for and active drill will start shortly. The 101st are also planning to form a signal corps, although their signal officer has not yet been appointed. Sergeant Major Baty is a qualified signaller and will doubtless assist in the instruction of the corps.\n\nThe Fusiliers have organized a strong athletic club in connection with the regiment and sports of all kinds will flourish this year. It is the intention to organize amateur baseball, football and cricket teams this year and to enter men from this organization in almost every line of athletics. The following are the officers of the 101st Athletic club:—Hon. president—Col. E. B. Edwards.\nHon. vice-president—Major Carstairs.\nHon. chaplain—Rev. Dr. McQueen.\nPresident—Capt. Dr. Strong.\nVice-president—Capt. Geo. B. McLeod.\nSecretary-treasurer—Lieut. A. C. Gillespie.\nExecutive committee—Sergt. Major Baty, Color Sergt. Howland, Color Sergt. Adams, Sergt. Hodson and Pte Mahoney.\n\nThe unit continues to carry out individual and small unit training. The unit celebrated its 100th anniversary in April 2008.\nIn September 2011 the Eddies sent a number of soldiers on a decentralised basic parachute course with 3 PPCLI.\n\nThe regiment expanded to Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, with the establishment of C Company, The Loyal Edmonton Regiment, in August 2009.\n\n\nThe Loyal Edmonton Regiment Military Museum is located in Edmonton in the Prince of Wales Armouries\nHeritage Centre, the building where the regiment was based from 1920 to 1965. The building also houses the City of Edmonton Archives and the Telephone Historical Centre. The museum features two galleries and several smaller exhibits, and displays include historic firearms, uniforms, souvenirs, memorabilia, military accoutrements, and photos. The museum features an exhibit on the role of the 49th Battalion, CEF in Canada's Hundred Days Offensive.\n\n\n"}

His wife Lona was also an agent. They became spies because of their communist beliefs.\n\nMorris Cohen was born in Harlem, New York City, on July 2, 1910 to a Jewish immigrant family. His father had immigrated from an area near Kiev in present-day Ukraine. His mother was from Vilnius in present-day Lithuania, and they had met and married in New York. Cohen was a football standout at James Monroe High School in the Bronx. After briefly attending New York University he was awarded an athletic scholarship to Mississippi A&M College (now Mississippi State University). He was injured in a freshman game and was not able to play football after that, but was kept on scholarship as athletic manager. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in business, and after a year of graduate work transferred to the University of Illinois. There he was active in agitprop work for the National Student League, a communist front. He was declared \"persona non grata\" after one semester and returned to the Bronx, where he became a full member and organizer for the Communist Party USA. After World War II he received a master's degree in education from Columbia University. \n\n In 1937, Cohen joined the Mackenzie–Papineau Battalion and fought as a foreign national volunteer in the Spanish Civil War, as did many young Americans who were sympathetic to the anti-Franco movement. He met Amadeo Sabatini, a veteran and career Soviet spy who recruited him. After being injured, in November 1938 Cohen returned to the United States. He began serving Soviet foreign intelligence.\n\nIn mid-1942, Cohen was drafted into the U.S. Army and served in Europe. He was discharged from the Army in November 1945 and returned to the United States where he resumed his espionage work for the Soviet Union.\n\nAs Soviet spy networks were compromised in this period, connection with Soviet intelligence was temporarily ended, but resumed in 1948, when the Rezidentura ascertained that Cohen could be approached. Together with Lona Cohen, they ensured the continued secret connection with a number of the most valuable sources of the Rezidentura. They began working with Col. Rudolph Abel up to 1950, when they secretly left the United States and moved to Lublin, Poland. While in Poland, Morris and Lona engaged in numerous foreign missions for the Soviet Union, traveling to Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, Austria, Belgium, and the Netherlands.\n\nIn 1954, the Cohens moved to 45 Cranley Drive in Ruislip, where they had numerous pieces of disguised spy equipment, and an antenna looping around their attic, used for their transmissions to Moscow. Their cover was as antiquarian book dealers under the names of Peter and Helen Kroger, and they worked with Gordon Lonsdale of Soviet intelligence. Morris became the British illegal resident.\n\nBritish security officials arrested the Cohens on January 7, 1961, for their part in a Soviet espionage network known as the Portland Spy Ring that had penetrated the Royal Navy. They were convicted of espionage for the Soviet Union and sentenced to prison. Morris and Lona served eight years in prison, less than half of their sentences, because they were subjects of a prisoner exchange.\n\nIn 1967, the Soviet Union admitted that the Cohens were spies. In July 1969, Britain exchanged them for Gerald Brooke, a British subject held in the Soviet Union. Both the United States and the UK had conducted such exchanges before, such as Soviet spy Rudolf Abel for U2 pilot Gary Powers, and Gordon Lonsdale for Greville Wynne in 1962. But In this case, the opposition criticised Harold Wilson's Labour Government for agreeing to release dangerous Soviet agents, such as the Krogers (i.e., the Cohens), in exchange for Brooke, described as a propagandist. Opponents claimed that it set a dangerous precedent and was an example of blackmail rather than a fair exchange.\n\nThe Cohens went to Moscow, where Morris trained spies for the Soviets. He and Lona were later given pensions by the KGB, and lived in Moscow for the remainder of their lives.\n\n In 1941, Cohen married Lona, a Communist Party USA activist. She later became a spy and courier for Manhattan Project physicist Theodore Hall. They were part of a ring of atomic spies who were later revealed to have been far more damaging t US interests than the well-known Rosenberg ring).\n\nDuring some period, Cohen was an employee of Amtorg.\n\nAfter training Soviet agents in Moscow for decades, Cohen retired on a pension, as did his wife. He died in Moscow on June 23, 1995. (His wife Lona had died in 1992)\n\nThe Cohens were awarded the Order of the Red Banner and the Order of Friendship of Nations by the Soviet Union for their espionage work. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, they also were given the title of Hero of the Russian Federation by the Yeltsin government. \n\nThe Cohens are referenced in Venona decrypts 1239 KGB New York to Moscow, August 30, 1944; 50 KGB New York to Moscow, January 11, 1945, regarding an erroneous report that Morris Cohen had been killed in Europe. The Cohens helped pass Manhattan Project secrets to the Soviet Union. His code name in Soviet intelligence and the Venona files is \"Volunteer\".\n\nBritish playwright Hugh Whitemore dramatized the case as \"Pack of Lies,\" which was performed in London's West End, starring Judi Dench and Michael Williams. The play was produced on Broadway for 3½ months in 1985, with Rosemary Harris starring; she won the best actress Tony award for her portrayal of a British neighbor of the Cohens/Krogers. \n\nThe play was adapted as a TV movie starring Ellen Burstyn, Alan Bates, Teri Garr and Daniel Benzali (as \"Peter Schaefer,\" i.e., \"Peter Kroger\"/ Morris Cohen) which aired in the U.S. on CBS in 1987. The plot centered on the neighbors (and seeming friends), whose house was used as a base from which the British security services could spy on the Cohens. It explored the way that paranoia, suspicion and betrayal gradually destroyed their lives during that time.\n\nHelene Hanff in her book, \"The Duchess of Bloomsbury Street\" (1973), notes the Cohens’ cover as antiquarian book dealers Peter and Helen Kroger. Under those identities, they were friends of London book dealer Frank Doel. Based on her long-term friendship with Doel, mostly via letters, she had earlier written and published \"84 Charing Cross Road\" (1970), which was a bestseller.\n\n\n"}

It falls under the Papworth Everard and Caxton ward and lies within the diocese of Ely. The village covers an area of 1,053 ha. (2,602 a.) Boxworth is a relatively small village, with around 100 houses.\n\nThe place-name 'Boxworth' is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as \"Bochesuuorde\". It appears as \"Bukeswrth\" in 1228 in the Feet of Fines. The name means 'Bucc's enclosure or homestead'.\n\nIn the 1664 Hearth Tax, a large house belonging to a gentleman, Mr Killingworth, accounted for eight hearths at Boxworth.\n\nBoxworth's population, once considerable, shrank severely after the Middle Ages before recovering to reach a peak of c350 in the mid-19th century.\n\nIn 1870–72, John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales described Boxworth like this:\n\"BOXWORTH, a parish in the district of St. Ives and county of Cambridge; 3 miles WSW of Long-Stanton r. station, and 5 SSE of St. Ives. Post Town, Long-Stanton, under Cambridge. Acres, 2,521. Real property, £2,946 Pop., 347. Houses, 64. The property is divided among a few. The living is a rectory in the diocese of Ely. Value, £459.* Patron, G. Thornhill, Esq. The church has a monument of Sanderson, the blind professor of mathematics; and is good.\"\n\nBoxworth today has one public house, the Golden Ball. The pub dates from at least the 1760s, but took its current name in 1820.\n\nRecorded from the mid-12th century, when relics of St. 'Inicius' were said to be deposited there, the church of St Peter is an ancient edifice of flint and stone in the Decorated style, consisting of a chancel, a nave of four bays, a south aisle, north and south porches and a lofty, embattled tower containing a clock and one bell: in the church is a monument to Nicholas Saunderson LLD, FRS, the celebrated blind professor of mathematics at the University of Cambridge, who died on 19 April 1739. The church was thoroughly restored in 1868–9, and provides seating for 150 worshippers. There are some pictures and a description of the church at the Cambridgeshire Churches website. There is a more comprehensive history at www.british-history.ac.uk.\nThe Road is designed to be a small access road to the rural outlying villages of Cambridge surrounding it, including Elsworth, Conington and Knapwell, and is usually quiet. However, as the village lies between two major roads – the A428 and the notorious A14 (previously A604) – it is occasionally used more heavily, especially when one of the major roads is blocked. In 2004–05, traffic calming measures in the form of chicanes were introduced at both ends of the village. This is considerably less traffic-calming than is found in surrounding villages, which make heavy use of road humps and speed-reduction signs. The traffic-calming measures are often a controversial issue.\n\nBetween 2003 and 2005, plans were drawn up to build a wind farm on arable land in the north of Boxworth. A total of 16 turbines were planned, and a number of residents of the village started a campaign called \"Stop Cambridge Wind Farm\", with the aim of blocking the windfarm's construction. In early 2005 the application was rejected by Cambridgeshire County Council, and a subsequent appeal was also rejected.\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Boxworth was 35.2 °C, on 1 August 1995.\n\n"}

At Wimbledon, Berdych made it to the semifinals for the first time since his run to the finals in 2010, beating Jiri Vesely in five sets in the round of 16 and Lucas Pouille in straight sets in the quarterfinals before losing in straight sets to eventual champion Andy Murray.\n\nAfter a quarterfinal loss in Canada and a third round loss in Cincinnati, Berdych was forced to withdraw from the US Open due to appendicitis. This was the first Grand Slam Berdych had missed since his first slam appearance in 2003, ending a streak of 52 consecutive Grand Slam appearances. Berdych returned to action on the Asian swing, reaching the semifinals in St. Petersburg and winning the title in Shenzhen over Richard Gasquet before suffering early losses in Tokyo and Shanghai. His year concluded with a quarterfinal finish in Paris. Ending the year ranked 10th, Berdych did not qualify for the ATP World Tour Finals for the first time since 2010, ending a streak of six straight year-end championship appearances.\n\nBerdych started 2017 ranked No. 10 and had a mixed year of highs and lows. He again reached the semifinals at Doha, losing again in straight sets, this time to Andy Murray. At the Australian Open his first opponent retired after the first set and Berdych went on to reach the round of 32, ultimately losing in straight sets to Roger Federer. Berdych reached the semifinals of the at ABN Amro World Tennis Tournament in Rotterdam where he was defeated by Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in straight sets. At the Miami Open, Berdych reached the quarterfinals, taking Roger Federer to three sets but ultimately losing a tie-break. He reached the round of 16 at his next three tournaments in Monte Carlo, Madrid and Rome. Berdych played excellently at the first Lyon Open to be held since 2009, beating Gilles Simon and Milos Raonic on his way to the final, only to be beaten by Tsonga, all matches being straight sets. Conversely, Berdych was able to reach only the round of 64 at the 2017 French Open, where he lost to Russian Karen Khachanov.\n\nOn the up again, he reached the quarterfinals at both Stuttgart and London's Queen's Club, losing in each case to Feliciano Lopez. Having seen off the likes of Dominic Thiem and Novak Djokovic in earlier rounds at Wimbledon, Berdych succumbed in the semifinal to a superb Roger Federer, who went on to win the Championship. At the US Open, he was able to reach only the round of 64, taking Alexandr Dolgopolov to four sets but no further. After playing for Team Europe in the inaugural Laver Cup, hosted in Berdych's home capital Prague, the Czech shut down his season early with a back injury after losing in the round of 16 at Beijing. Berdych finished the year ranked 19th, his first year-end ranking outside the top ten since 2009.\n\nBerdych began his Australian swing playing at the Tie Break Tens exhibition tournament in Melbourne on the Wednesday before the Australian Open. Berdych beat Nick Kyrgios and Milos Raonic en route to the final where he defeated No. 1 Rafael Nadal 10–5. In winning, Berdych won $250,000 (Australian).\n\nAt the Australian Open 2018 he played in the first round beating rising Australian player Alex de Minaur in four sets to set up a match against Guillermo García López which Berdych won. In the third and fourth rounds Berdych beat Juan Martín del Potro and Fabio Fognini both in straight sets before losing in the quarterfinals to Roger Federer.\n\nBerdych beat Maximilian Marterer in the second round at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, but was defeated in straight sets by Hyeon Chung in the third round. The Czech had a terrible clay court season, losing his opening matches in Monte-Carlo, Madrid and Rome. At the French Open, he lost in the first round to Jérémy Chardy in five sets. He then withdrew from Wimbledon due to a back injury and missed the rest of the season, finishing the year ranked 71.\n\nBerdych returned from his injury hiatus with terrific results, reaching the final in Doha (losing to Roberto Bautista Agut in three sets) and the round of 16 at the Australian Open (losing to Rafael Nadal in straight sets). After losing in the first round in Indian Wells, Berdych again missed time with injury. He lost in the first round of Wimbledon to Taylor Fritz and again at the US Open to Jenson Brooksby; 1–6, 6–2, 4–6, 4–6.\n\nBerdych announced his retirement from tennis at the ATP finals\n\nBerdych is sponsored by Head for his rackets and he is currently endorsing the Head Graphene Touch Instinct MP paintjob with a TGK260.2 Radical MP 16x19 underneath. He used both the Graphene XT Instinct MP and the Graphene Instinct MP paintjob from the 2013 season on. For the 2012 season, Berdych used the Head YouTek IG Instinct MP paintjob. From the start of 2010 through the end of the 2011 season, he used the Pro Stock Head YouTek Radical MP with a 16/19 string pattern. Before the 2010 season, he was sponsored by Dunlop Sport and used the Dunlop Aerogel 4D 200.\n\nIn January 2013, it was announced Berdych had signed a partnership with Swedish fashion house H&M, after his contract with Nike ended earlier in the month. He acted as a spokesperson and co-designer for tennis wear for the brand. Berdych debuted his new clothing on 2013 Miami Masters. In 2016, Berdych moved to Adidas and launched his first watch from Felio Siby.\n\nIn 2018, Berdych was announced as brand ambassador for the Italian clothing company Hydrogen.\n\n"}

She is notable for her role in smuggling atomic bomb diagrams out of Los Alamos. She was a communist activist before marrying Morris Cohen. They became spies because of their communist beliefs. \n\nThey were both arrested in Britain in 1961, and convicted of espionage the following year for the Soviet Union. After serving part of a prison sentence, Lona Cohen and her husband were exchanged by the British in 1969. They lived the remainder of their lives in Moscow, teaching spy skills. \n\nLona Cohen was born Leontine Theresa Petka in Adams, Massachusetts, the daughter of Polish Catholic immigrants. At the age of 15, Lona left her parents' home in Taftsville, Connecticut and moved to New York City. By 1928 she had joined the Socialist Party. While in Greenwich Village, Lona had left her parents' Catholic faith and had become an atheist. She also separated from the Socialist Party at this time, becoming a member of the Communist Party. George Blake, a British mole for the Soviet Union, claimed in an interview that Lona was a \"very, very resolute woman, very determined\". \n\nAt the time of her marriage to Morris Cohen in 1941, she did not know that her husband was a spy for the Soviet Union. That year he recruited her into Soviet espionage out of the New York \"rezidentura\". She and Morris first worked for Soviet control officer Semyon Semyonov until Semyonov was identified to the FBI in an anonymous letter, after which he was recalled back to Moscow. After four months Lona and Morris were assigned to a new control officer, Anatoli Yatskov.\n\nThe Cohens were first tasked with stealing newly developed American weapons for the Soviet Union. Lona met a young man, identified in her report as Allen, working at an aircraft plant in Hartford, Connecticut. She then asked Allen to smuggle a working model of a new machine gun out of his plant. He agreed, in exchange for $2,000. By carrying it on his shoulders beneath his coat, Allen was able to sneak it out of the plant. Morris then hid the weapon inside a bass fiddle case and transported it into the Soviet consulate while avoiding detection.\n\nAfter Morris was drafted in 1942, Lona took over the expanding Volunteer Network that Morris had been maintaining and managed seven agents. Their work was titled Line X. As part of Line X, Lona conducted \"technical, scientific, and industrial espionage\", delivering and receiving documents along the East Coast. She frequently received documents from seamen from South America and Europe, using her charm to persuade dock-workers to permit her access to the ships. Later, Semyonov wrote an appraisal of Cohen, commending her love of the Soviet Union and her work with agent Link, eventually identified as Bill Weisband.\n\nWhile conducting her Line X work, she worked at two defense plants. First, in 1942, at Publix Metals as a machine operator, and then in 1943 at Aircraft Screw Products. While working at Aircraft Screw Products, Lona was in an accident and had part of her hair ripped from her head. A supervisor she worked under accused her of preaching Communism.\n\nAs word leaked to the Soviets of the developing Manhattan Project, Lona Cohen was chosen by her new control officer, Anatoli Yatskov, to work as a courier. Lona's job was to transport classified information from Theodore Hall, and a source cover named \"FOGEL\" and \"PERS\" from the American secret atomic weapons project at Los Alamos, New Mexico and carry them to the Soviet consulate in New York. There, a KGB sub-residency under a young engineer, Leonid R. Kvasnikov, coordinated operations and dispatched intelligence to Moscow.\n\nLona met with Hall for the first time in late August 1945, outside a church in Albuquerque, New Mexico. She had been to this church the previous four Sundays, but Hall had been confused about the date of their meet and did not show up until nearly a month after originally scheduled. Hall gave her the report that she had traveled for, and she was sent back to New York. To avoid detection she concealed the report inside a Kleenex box, a move which became somewhat famous within Soviet spy circles for its cleverness. After making it back to New York, it was discovered that the report she had helped deliver contained a complete diagram of the first atomic bomb.\n\nAfter the defections of Elizabeth Bentley and Igor Gouzenko, the Cohens ended contact with Soviet intelligence until 1949, at which time they began working with Col. Rudolph Abel, a U.S.-based illegal resident. After Klaus Fuchs was arrested in the United Kingdom in 1950, Cohen and her husband had no choice but to flee to Moscow. They left their home in New York and never returned to America, passing the southern border and travelling through Mexico. They were placed in Lublin, Poland, until 1954. There, Morris worked as an English teacher. The Cohens went on many foreign missions for the Soviets during this time, traveling to Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, Austria, Belgium, and the Netherlands. They received New Zealand passports in Paris from the New Zealand embassy, and also made trips to Canada. In Moscow, Lona had received additional training as a radio operator and cipher clerk.\n\nIn 1954, the pair resurfaced in Ruislip, west London, under the names Helen and Peter Kroger. They used the New Zealand passports they had received in Paris and claimed to be native Canadians. They set up an antiquarian book business which was cover for their activities of running the London Illegal Rezidentura. Gordon Lonsdale worked with them as part of the Portland Spy Ring.\n\nWhile in London, the Cohens were friends with Frank and Nora Doel. Frank Doel is the bookseller whose correspondence with the author Helene Hanff became the bestseller, \"84 Charing Cross Road\". In her follow-up book, \"The Duchess of Bloomsbury Street\", Hanff reported an anecdote told her by Nora Doel. One New Year's Eve, the Doels gave a party at which Lona Cohen (aka Helen Kroger):arrived looking very exotic in a long black evening dress. 'Helen, you look like a Russian spy!' said Nora. And Helen laughed and Peter laughed and a few months later Nora picked up the morning paper and discovered that Helen and Peter Kruger \"were\" Russian spies.\n\nIn the basement of their house, at 45 Cranley Drive, Ruislip, situated not far from the military airfield of RAF Northolt, they set up a high-speed radio transmitter and began sending Moscow \"information of special importance\". \n\nIn January 1961 they were arrested for espionage; in March she was convicted and received a sentence of 20 years. Her husband Morris Cohen was sentenced to 25 years. \n\nBefore being taken into custody, Cohen/Kroger had asked permission to stoke up the boiler. Before she could do so, Detective Superintendent Smith, a veteran \"spy catcher\" who was in charge of the arrest, insisted on checking her handbag. It was found to contain microdots, the photographic reduction of documents, in order to make them small enough to be smuggled out of the country more easily.\n\nIn 1969 the British arranged a prisoner exchange, trading the Cohens with the Soviet Union for a British subject, Gerald Brooke. Once in Moscow, the Cohens continued training colleagues for illegal intelligence operations. Later the Cohens were provided with pensions by the KGB. \n\nLona Cohen died in Moscow on December 23, 1992. She was 79 years of age. Her husband, Morris, lived for three years following her death. They were both buried in the KGB's Novokuntsevo Cemetery.\n\nBoth Lona and Morris Cohen received the Order of the Red Banner from the Soviet Union. Both were also given the title of Heroes of the Russian Federation.\n\nIn 1983, the British playwright Hugh Whitemore dramatized the case as \"Pack of Lies\", which was performed in London's West End theatre district starring Judi Dench and Michael Williams. It played on Broadway for 3½ months in 1985, for which Rosemary Harris won the best actress Tony award for her portrayal of the British neighbor of the Cohens/Krogers. It was made into a TV movie starring Ellen Burstyn, Alan Bates, Teri Garr and Daniel Benzali (as \"Peter Schaefer\", i.e., \"Peter Kroger\", i.e., Morris Cohen) which aired in the U.S. on CBS in 1987. The plot centered on the neighbors (and seeming friends) whose house was used as a base from which the security services could spy on the Cohens, and the way paranoia, suspicion and betrayal gradually destroyed their lives during that time.\n\nThe Cohens' cover as antiquarian book dealers Peter and Helen Kroger is mentioned in Helene Hanff's \"The Duchess of Bloomsbury Street\" because they were friends of London book dealer Frank Doel, recipient of the letters and book orders that inspired the bestseller \"84 Charing Cross Road\".\n\n"}

{"id": "1896389", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896389", "title": "Canntaireachd", "text": "Canntaireachd\n\nCanntaireachd (; ) is the ancient Scottish Highland method of notating \"Piobaireachd\", also spelt \"Pibroch\", referred to more generally as \"Ceòl Mòr\" (literally the \"big music\"), an art music genre primarily played on the Great Highland Bagpipes. These long and complex theme and variation tunes were traditionally transmitted orally by a combination of definite vocable syllables. In general, the vowels represent the notes, and consonants the grace notes, but this is not always the case, as the system has inconsistencies and was not fully standardized.\n\nPipers have used musical staff notation to read and write pibroch tunes since the early nineteenth century. Many of the early staff notated scores for modern pibroch published by Angus MacKay and authorised by the Piobaireachd Society are now considered by scholars to have been oversimplified, with standardisations of time signatures and editing out of ornamental complexities, when tunes are compared with versions in earlier manuscripts such as the \"Campbell Canntaireachd\". The practice of canntaireachd singing remains the preferred means for many pipers to convey the musicality and pacing of pibroch performance when teaching or rehearsing a tune.\n\nCanntaireachd was first written down at the end of the 18th century in the \"Campbell Canntaireachd\" by Colin Campbell of Nether Lorn, Argyll. While his vocable system had its origins in chanted notation, the \"Campbell Canntaireachd\" is now considered to have been intended as a written documentation of the music, to be read rather than sung. Nevertheless, Cambell's Nether Lorn Canntaireachd was adopted by the Piobaireachd Society in their publications and has become the most commonly used vocable system. Another related system of Canntaireachd was published by Niel McLeod of Gesto, reputedly taken down from the chanted singing of John MacCrimmon, one of the last practicing members of that esteemed piping family. The MacArthur family of pipers are reported to have had their own oral form of Canntaireachd system that was not documented. A further variety of Canntaireachd and distinct collection of pibroch tunes was sourced from Simon Fraser, whose family emigrated to Melbourne in the 19th century. It is assumed that different lineages of pipers developed distinct forms of Canntaireachd that were variations on a broadly similar system of sung vocable notation. This informal oral variation continues today in the practices of experienced piping musicians and teachers.\n\nWilliam Donaldson, in \"The Highland Pipe and Scottish Society 1750-1950\" states:\n\nThe table given is based on the advice of Charles Bannatyne of Salsburgh, Holyhead. Some of the notes resemble each other very closely, but the changes used are indicated, and the pronunciations are given approximately in brackets.\n\nThe key note \"Low A\" is always represented in this notation by \"in\", probably a contraction of \"An Dàra Aon\", the second one, to distinguish the key note from the first note on the chanter—\"low G\". \"High A\" is always \"i\", but in a \"canntaireachd\", it is often denoted by a preceding \"l\", thus \"liu\", and so confusion is avoided. \"Low A\" is either \"in\", \"en\", \"em\", or simply \"n\" after some notes. The alternatives seem to have been used for the sake of euphony.\n\n\"D\" note is \"a\" and \"B\" note is \"a\", but the qualifying effect of the grace notes — \"high G\" represented by \"h\", and \"D\" represented by \"d\" or \"h\" (the latter a contraction of \"\"a’ chorrag\"\", the Gaelic name for the finger playing \"D\") prevents any confusion.\n\nThe note \"E\" is represented by \"i\". At the beginning of most of the MacCrimmon tunes and variations is \"l\", which gives the keynote. It stands for \"E\" (soh), the dominant of the \"low A\" (doh). Where it does not occur, the tune will be found to start with a word like \"hien\", which denotes \"E\" with \"High G\" grace note, and then \"low A\".\n\nThe vowel for \"F\" note is \"ie\", and it is always made certain by the grace note \"d\" or \"h\".\n\n\"High G\" is \"u\", often distinguished by a preceding \"h\".\n\n\"High A\" is often \"vi\" to distinguish it from the \"E\" note. When \"F\" succeeds \"high A\" in a tune, the word is often \"vie\".\n\nRegarding grace notes, \"h\" the aspirate, qualifies all notes down to \"low A\", but often where \"ha\" obviously means \"B\" note, it must be concluded that it should be written \"cha\" (xa). Similarly \"ho ho\" should be \"ho cho\" (ho xo). The letter \"d\" is used, as is \"t\" to denote both \"High G\" and \"D\" grace notes, but an examination of the notation word, makes a mistake unlikely, thus \"dieliu\" means \"F\" with \"high G\" grace note, and then \"high A\" and \"G\". \"Tihi\" means two \"E\"s played with two \"G\" grace notes. \"T\" and \"d\" resemble each other very closely in Gaelic, but the context in \"canntaireachd\" makes it always easy to see whether \"high G\" grace note or \"D\" is meant. It is necessary to explain the compound grace note systems. \"Dr\" is doubling of \"low G\" by a touch of \"D\" grace note, and open \"low A\", and so on, over the whole scale. The letters \"dr\" are obviously a contraction of \"dà uair\", two times, or twice. \"Trì\" means doubling of \"low G\" by \"D\" grace note, and as \"A\" is opened, double \"E\" by \"F\" and \"E\" and open \"E\". This is a \"\"Crunluath\"\" form. \"Tro\" is the same, at first, but the doubling of \"E\" is done with the grips from \"o\" or the \"C\" note. This is \"\"Crunluath-a-mach\"\" (outer \"\"crunnluath\"\"). These examples will make the rest easy. In many tunes where the \"tr\" type appears, it obviously when translated should only have been a \"dr\" type, this confusion being only to the similarity of \"d\" and \"t\" in Gaelic.\n\nThe shake on \"high A\" is \"vivi\". The other shakes are represented by \"rr\", according to from where the beats and shakes are taken. This seems to be a contraction of \"\"gearradh\"\" meaning a \"shake\". A simple touch of a note before opening is always represented by a single \"r\". For instance, such a word as \"radin\" signifies that \"B\" is to be touched with \"Low G\" (\"lùdag\") before opening; \"-din\" is \"low A\" with \"D\" grace note. \"Ho radin\" is the \"C\" note \"o\" with \"high G\" grace note keeping the \"ra-\" below \"D\" note, also an \"A\" note.\n\n1 – All grace notes and grace note types are forestrokes, that is they occur before the notes they embellish. They are \"appoggiaturas\" or \"semiquaver\" notes, or \"Caciaturas\" or demi-semi-quaver notes, which predominate.\n\n2 – All grace notes in canntaireachd are represented by consonants.\n\n3 – All compound forms are made by combining single forms.\n\n4 – All leading or scale notes are represented by vowels.\n\n5 – All note forms with \"m\" or \"n\" in them contain \"low A\".\n\n6 – Grace notes \"h\" and \"d\" are qualifying or modulating grace notes.\n\n7 – Doublings are represented by \"dr\", triplings by \"tr\", compound types by combinations of these.\n\n8 – Open doublings above \"D\" are represented by \"dir\", such as \"dirie\", where the note is doubled by itself, and the note above it. \"Dr\" represents closed doublings, and \"dir\" open doublings.\n\nGrace note forms consist of single, double, and compound:\n\n\"Hiodratatiriri\" is a pure \"\"cliabh-lugh\"\"—the chest or creel of fingers, because every finger on the chanter is engaged in some way, either acting or acted on. In bagpipe music, the variations are all named from the acting fingers, and the old pipers counted their time from the number of fingers engaged in the several parts of the tune. \"Chin-drine\" may be taken as an example of the \"\"leum-lugh\"\", the jump of the fingers. This is \"low A\", played by \"D\" grace note, then \"G\" doubled by \"D\", \"low A\" then opened, and \"F\" rapidly opened from it. \"Hiriri\" is an example of a beat form. The playing of two \"low A\"s by touching \"low G\" twice with the little finger is \"ririn\", or \"rurin\". The prosodic quality of the syllables, together with the spacing and punctuation, give the time and rhythm of the tunes.\n\n\n\n"}

In the context of the oracle bones of ancient China, which chiefly utilized both scapulae and the plastrons of turtle, \"scapulimancy\" is sometimes used in a very broad sense to jointly refer to both scapulimancy and plastromancy (similar divination using plastrons). However, the term \"osteomancy\" might be more appropriate, referring to divination using bones. Many archaeological sites along the south coast and offlying islands of the Korean peninsula show that deer and pig scapulae were used in divination during the Korean Protohistoric Period, c. 300 BC - AD 300/400.\n\nHistorically, scapulimancy has taken two major forms. In the first, \"apyromantic\", the scapula of an animal was simply examined after its slaughter. This form was widespread in Europe, Northern Africa and the Near East. However, the second form, \"pyromantic\" scapulimancy, involving the heating or burning of the bone and interpretation of the results, was practiced in East Asia and North America.\n\nScapulimancy was also mentioned in Chapter 5 of the Kojiki, the Japanese Record of Ancient Matters, in which the heavenly deities used this process of divination during a consultation by lesser gods.\n\nIt is also a method of divination among Greek and Serb farmers, even today. It is probably of extremely ancient origin. More recently, references are found in the memoirs of several warriors who fought during the Greek War of Independence. Whenever they had a feast, they used to roast lambs or kids, and after the meal, anyone who knew how to \"read\" the scapula would clean it of any remaining flesh and, lifting it up to the light, would interpret the various shadowy bits showing on the transparent part of the bone. A clear scapula was a good omen. Shadowy bits had their interpretation and by this they used to predict the outcome of a battle on the morrow, death or survival.\n\nIn Renaissance magic, scapulimancy (known as \"spatulamancy\") was classified as one of the seven \"forbidden arts,\" along with necromancy, geomancy, aeromancy, pyromancy, chiromancy (palmistry), and hydromancy.\n\n\n"}

When they first brought him to a piano, he reportedly played music from various genres (ranging from classical music by Tchaikovsky to pop music by the Beatles) non-stop for four hours, and then was taken away by the hospital staff.\n\nFor several months, Grassl was interned in a secure mental health unit in north Kent while he was being treated and evaluated. Interpreters were unable to discover his origin. Orchestras around Europe were contacted in a bid to trace his identity.\n\nThe West Kent NHS and Social Care Trust, and the local police received what they described as an \"overwhelming\" public response, receiving over 800 calls on a dedicated helpline.\n\nThe story was broken when a social worker contacted the \"Daily Mail\" for help. A local photographer named Mike Gunnill was commissioned to take photographs. This proved difficult at first but Gunnill in the end managed to photograph Grassl when he left the hospital for his usual daily walk around the grounds. All this was arranged by the social worker. While waiting, the social worker gave the photographer the \"mystery man's\" sketch book. The only sketch worth copying was a large image of a grand piano. The rest of the book were just lines and doodles, despite comments later there was no flag image in the book.\n\nFrom the sketch of the grand piano, the \"Daily Mail\" started calling him \"piano man\". Despite having the story first, the \"Daily Mail\" didn't use it until later. Executives at Associated Newspapers thought he was an \"asylum seeker\" who had arrived in Kent. Two weeks later, the photographer was told the story would not be used by the \"Daily Mail\" and he was free to use the images as he wished. The \"Mail on Sunday\" used a small image on the front page, but this was removed after the first three editions. This was enough to start a media storm over \"Piano Man\".\n\nGrassl's picture was posted on the UK charity Missing People's website (formerly the National Missing Persons Helpline). On 18 May 2005, a Polish man working as a mime artist in Rome approached Italian police officers, believing the Piano Man to be a French busker called Steven Villa Masson. However, the British newspaper \"The Independent\" tracked down Masson to his home in France, thus ruling out this lead.\n\nItalian television stations showed footage of a concert pianist with a resemblance to the Piano Man—the pictures were filmed at an instrument fair in Rimini five years earlier. Observers found his hair different, but his nose and facial structure very similar. He also stayed silent. British tabloids also suggested a link to a man last seen in Canada two years previously, Sywald Skeid (then known as Philip Staufen), who had wandered into a Toronto emergency department apparently suffering from amnesia. His true identity was revealed in a \"GQ magazine\" article as in fact Sywald Skeid.\n\nBBC News reported on 29 May 2005 that a Czech musician called Klaudius Kryšpín, the drummer of a Czech rock band \"Pražský výběr\" (\"Prague Selection\"), had rung the helpline, offering information that Piano Man might be a pianist called Tomáš Strnad, who along with Kryšpín was a member of the tribute band \"Ropotamo\" in the 1980s. Also, Klaudius Kryšpín's twin brother Richard who lives in Columbus, Ohio, United States confirmed that Piano Man had a striking resemblance to Strnad.\n\nAnother person who argued that Strnad might have been Piano Man was Michael Kocáb, the singer of \"Pražský výběr\" and a former adviser of Václav Havel. A problem with this theory was that Kocáb argued that he met Strnad on 10 April 2005 near Prague (three days after the Piano Man was found in England). Even though the West Kent NHS Trust described this as a \"promising lead\" and reportedly planned to bring in a Czech interpreter, this theory (like the theory that it was Steven Villa Masson, above) was dashed when Tomáš Strnad was found and interviewed on Czech TV.\n\nOn 3 June 2005, Dateline NBC, the American NBC network's investigative news magazine, featured the story of the Piano Man as its top story.\n\nOn 24 June 2005, Susanne Schlippe-Steffensen (Dansk Folkeparti), a local council member of the Danish municipality of Karlebo, near Copenhagen, made a claim on Danish TV 2/Lorry, that the Piano Man was in fact her Algerian-born husband. Steffensen had not seen her husband since February, when he had travelled to Algeria to visit his sick mother. \"He has lost 20 kilos and bleached his hair, but I can see in his eyes that it is him. I will never be wrong when I see those eyes\", she said to TV 2/Lorry.\n\nSteffensen's theory was that her husband had travelled to England due to a conflict with his family. According to Steffensen the family was unhappy with the fact that he was married to a western woman. \"I think he has fled for his life. He has previously received death threats,\" said Steffensen. She went to England to meet her claimed husband, but according to Steffensen the hospital did not allow her to meet him.\n\nOn 2 July 2005, BBC News reported that the Piano Man, when shown a map, pointed to Oslo, the capital of Norway. A Norwegian-speaking person was brought in to open communications. According to the report the Piano Man seemed more responsive when Norwegian was spoken even though he remained unable or unwilling to speak. The theory was further strengthened by claims that a Norwegian vessel was in the area at the time the man was discovered.\n\nAccording to media reports, the Piano Man also made a drawing of the Swedish flag after coming to the hospital. This led to speculation that he had lived in one of the Scandinavian countries.\n\nBetween 4 July and 6 July, students from Norway said they knew the man in question as an exchange student from Ireland. These beliefs and possible leads were dashed when Norwegian papers were able to contact the man who the Piano Man was thought to be.\n\nDiagnoses of his condition initially focused on post-traumatic stress disorder but it was at the time thought he might be an autistic savant. Autistic savants can display extraordinary but highly specific talents, while at the same time remaining withdrawn or uncommunicative to the point of constant silence. The trust refused to officially comment on the young man's treatment beyond saying that his physical health remained good, but it was understood he was showing increasing signs of a rapport with a small number of trusted caregivers.\n\nOn 22 August, the British tabloid newspaper \"The Mirror\" reported that the Piano Man had finally broken his silence after more than four months, and that he had been exposed as a hoax. Additionally, the \"Mirror\"'s source claimed that he did not play the piano properly, but \"just kept tapping one key continuously\". Hospital staff have maintained that his abilities were not exaggerated.\n\nThe \"Mirror\" article claimed that the Piano Man had told the medical staff that he was a gay German man, who had come to Britain on a Eurostar train after losing his job in Paris. According to the newspaper's source, the man claimed that he had been planning to commit suicide when he was discovered on the beach in Sheerness, that he did not talk to the police due to his distressed state, and that he then continued to act mute. The unnamed source also suggested that the Piano Man used to work with the mentally ill, and thus was able to mimic their behaviour, thereby fooling the hospital staff. According to the tabloids, he has been flown back to Germany where his father (a farmer) and his two sisters live.\n\nLater the same day the BBC reported that the German foreign ministry had confirmed that the man was a 20-year-old Bavarian who had flown home on 20 August. The German embassy in London confirmed that they had been contacted by the Little Brook Hospital, confirmed the man's identity and provided him with replacement travel documents.\n\nFollowing the media reports, the West Kent NHS and Social Care Trust issued a statement stating that the man was no longer in the care of the trust, that he had been \"discharged from [their] care following a marked improvement in his condition,\" and that their \"involvement with this man has now ceased and will not be resuming at any stage\". The statement also expressed that no further information was to be released.\n\nIn a follow-up to the story on 24 August, \"The Mirror\" named the man as Andreas Grassl and published an interview with his parents, farmers in Prosdorf, a village belonging to Waldmünchen in the Cham district of the Upper Palatinate in eastern Bavaria. According to the interview, their son had upon his return told them that he had \"no idea what happened to me. I just suddenly woke up and realised who I was.\" Grassl's father expressed anger with some allegations made in the original \"Mirror\" article, in particular the suggestions that his son's behaviour during treatment was not genuine. \"I know he would never make something like this up,\" the father said. He denied that his son was gay, and told the newspaper that his son in fact was an accomplished piano player, albeit not to a professional standard. Grassl's lawyer said he might have experienced a psychotic episode.\n\nAfter working with disabled people in Saarbrücken, Grassl apparently told his parents that he intended to leave to study in France. After that, his parents had not been able to reach him. They had reported him missing, but they did not see nor recognize the pictures of their son that were distributed around the world.\n\nFriends of Andreas Grassl told \"The Times\" that he'd spent hours in internet chat rooms, where he was known as \"Scatman\", and that he was a columnist for a local newspaper, writing about pop music.\n\nIn October 2014, AllthePigs Theatre Company announced that they were writing a play based on the theories and events that led to the 'Piano Man' at the New Diorama in London.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1896403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896403", "title": "Theme restaurant", "text": "Theme restaurant\n\nA theme restaurant is a type of restaurant that uses theming to attract diners by creating a memorable experience. Theme restaurants have a unifying or dominant subject or concept, and utilize architecture, decor, special effects, and other techniques, often to create exotic environments that are not normally associated with dining because they are inaccessible, no longer exist, are fictional or supernatural, or taboo. The theme may be further extended through the naming and choices of food, though food is usually secondary to entertaining guests.\n\nMost restaurants have an inherent “theme” based on the origin or type of cuisine served. Many restaurants have a distinct style of decor, and create a specific ambiance for the comfort of their clientele. Some have a unique location or are housed in a unique building. But not all restaurants are considered theme restaurants. Diners choose restaurants first and foremost based on type of food. Conversely, theme restaurants attract customers primarily by promising unique experiences.\n\nPopular chain restaurants in the United States such as Applebee's and Bennigan's, despite having distinct and consistent styles, are not usually considered theme restaurants, since they attract patrons primarily with the food they serve.\n\nWhile food is usually less important than experience, some theme restaurants use food to reinforce their themes. For example, restaurants themed to 1950s America frequently have jukeboxes from that era, but some also limit their menus to hamburgers and french fries, as would have been common at the time. The food at theme restaurants is often common in order to have broad appeal, but may be given colorful names to further the theme. For example, the Planet Hollywood in London offers specialty cocktails named after movies.\n\nIn some cases, customers may visit a theme restaurant only to shop or be entertained, without intending to eat. Theme restaurants have the potential for high profits in a relatively short period of time, in part by selling merchandise. Though arguably a type of theme restaurant, dinner theater restaurants are usually classified separately, despite consumers choosing them primarily for entertainment.\n\nIrish pubs and other similar ethnic restaurants that originated in a particular country but are now found around the world are considered theme restaurants by some, as they use theming to re-create an \"authentic\" experience.\n\nModern restaurants date to back to Eighteenth Century France. By the early Nineteenth Century, they had been introduced in America. In the late 1800s, restaurants began using theming to differentiate themselves from increasing competition. In the 1890s, at least three different elaborately themed nightclubs were operating in Paris, using themes of death, hell, and heaven. Similar restaurants soon opened in New York City.\n\nIn the early Twentieth Century, so-called “programmatic” or “mimetic” style structures became popular for restaurants, including buildings shaped like vehicles, animals, and even the food they served. This theming was largely a response to the growing popularity of the automobile, as the buildings themselves became advertisements aimed at passing motorists. Beginning in the 1920s, a number of novelty architecture buildings were constructed in and around Hollywood, including the famous Brown Derby restaurants and Bulldog Cafe.\n\nRestaurants such as Clifton's Cafeteria also started playing with grand decorations based on non-traditional \"kitschy\" themes, and movies helped fuel the desire by the average American to travel the Pacific. Ernest Raymond Beaumont Gantt opened Don the Beachcomber, generally recognized as the first tiki bar, in Los Angeles in the 1930s. Along with a neighbor, he collected old fishing nets, driftwood, and other ephemera from local beaches, and added bamboo and masks to theme his restaurant and evoke the South Pacific and Polynesian culture. Around the same time, another archetypal bar, Trader Vic's, was created by Victor Bergeron in Oakland, California. Tiki culture became very popular in 1950s America, and Polynesian themed restaurants had spread to London by the early 1960s, and further into Europe and Asia by the 1970s.\n\nThough arguably not the first theme park, the opening of Disneyland in 1955 popularized the idea of an amusement park combining multiple named areas (“lands”) with different themes. The term \"theme park\" came into use circa 1960, likely to describe the many parks built across the United States and around the world following Disneyland's success. As theming became more popular, the word was applied to other types of attractions, including \"theme restaurant\" and \"themed hotels.\"\n\nDavid Tallichet took inspiration from Disneyland when he opened his first theme restaurant The Reef in Long Beach, California. His company went on to open dozens of restaurants, with themes ranging from New England fishing villages and French farmhouses to aviation and World War II. Another fan of Disneyland, Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell, integrated food, entertainment, and an arcade into the first Chuck E. Cheese's, opened in San Jose, California in 1977. The restaurant featured animatronic animals that Bushnell claims were inspired by the Enchanted Tiki Room at Disneyland.\n\nThe North American theme restaurant chain Medieval Times was actually started on the small island of Mallorca, Spain in the 1970s. Jose Montaner put on his dinner show for years before attracting enough investors to open a location outside Walt Disney World in Florida in 1983.Now their \"castles\" are found across the United States and Canada.\n\nThe original Hard Rock Cafe was founded in 1971 in London. In 1979, following the donation of guitars by Eric Clapton and Pete Townshend, the cafe began covering its walls with rock and roll memorabilia. Today, this pioneering theme restaurant chain has some 185 locations in 74 countries. Following Hard Rock Cafe's successful theme of exhibiting music memorabilia, Planet Hollywood extended the concept to movies in the 1990s, while adding celebrity endorsements and appearances at the restaurants.\n\nSteven Schussler came up with the idea for Rainforest Cafe, and actually turned his house into a model jungle to attract investors, before opening the first location in the Mall of America in 1994. Dozens of locations around the world quickly followed, and many new theme restaurant chains opened in hopes of copying Rainforest Cafe's success. But by the late 1990s, dozens of theme restaurants closed, including entire chains, as the market became saturated and the novelty wore off.\n\nToday, though smaller than at its peak, the industry has rebounded, in part as Millennials turn to themed restaurants for dining entertainment. The popularity of social media platforms like Instagram has pushed restaurants to theme their physical spaces to inspire photographers. Temporary pop-up restaurants and bars are capitalizing on the popularity of nostalgia by using theming to immerse guests in their favorite programs and movies.\n\nMany theme restaurants create environments that are considered exotic because they are largely inaccessible to much of the public (such as rainforests and remote tropical islands), or no longer exist (because they are set in a past time period). However, some use subjects that are supernatural or taboo, and thus controversial. From the very beginning, restaurants in Paris, New York and San Francisco attracted bohemian artists and writers with themes including assassination, imprisonment, death, and hell.\n\nMore recently, the Modern Toilet Restaurant chain in Asia, and the similar but short-lived Magic Restroom Café in California offered diners the opportunity not only to sit on toilets while dining, but to also be served dishes in miniature toilet bowls.\n\nThe Alcatraz E.R. restaurant in Japan used a \"prison hospital\" or \"medical prison\" (mental institution) theme, where guests were handcuffed and led to \"cells\" to eat. Various \"shows\" were put on by costumed staff to scare guests. It closed on May 31, 2018.\n\nPerhaps the most infamous modern theme restaurant is Cross Cafe, originally named Hitler's Cross, outside Mumbai, India. Opened in 2006, it included a swastika on its sign, which it was quickly forced to remove. The owner was seemingly unaware of The Holocaust, and claimed only to have wanted a \"catchy name.\" Still, the original restaurant had very little theming beyond the name and logo, apparently limited to a large portrait of Adolf Hitler, and in its current form it would not be considered a theme restaurant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In HMS \"Terpsichore\" he also conveyed Charles Emmanuel, who had just abdicated as Prince of Piedmont, to exile in Sardinia in February 1799 and captured the Spanish ship \"San Antonio\" in June 1799. In July 1800 he was involved in an incident in which his squadron stopped and searched a Danish convoy heading for France: the incident led to the formation of the Second League of Armed Neutrality, an alliance between Denmark–Norway, Prussia, Sweden and Russia.\n\nGage became commanding officer of the fifth-rate HMS \"Uranie\" in the Channel Squadron in March 1801 and took part in the capture of the French ship \"Chevrette\" in July 1801.

In addition to cameo appearances in the last six of these titles, he has had prominent acting roles in films including \"The Great White Hype\" (1996), \"Cop Land\" (1997), \"Corky Romano\" (2001), \"Collateral\" (2004), \"Smokin' Aces\" (2006), and \"Lions for Lambs\" (2007).\n\nIn television, Berg developed \"Friday Night Lights\" (2006–2011), adapted from his film, earning two Primetime Emmy Award nominations. As an actor, he is best known for his role as Dr. Billy Kronk on the CBS medical drama \"Chicago Hope\" (1995–1999).\n\nBerg was born in 1964 in New York City, the son of Laurence \"Larry\", a US Marine, and Sally (Winkler) Berg. Berg's father was Jewish, as was his maternal grandfather. His mother was Christian.\n\nThrough his mother, Berg is a second cousin of writer H. G. Bissinger, whose book \"Friday Night Lights\" provided the basis for Berg's film and TV series of the same name. His mother co-founded a youth group named Catalog for Giving and worked at a psychiatric hospital when Berg was growing up. He has a younger sister, Mary.\n\nPeter was a student in the Chappaqua School System. After graduating from The Taft School in 1980, Berg attended Macalester College in Saint Paul, Minnesota, where he majored in theater arts and theater history. He graduated in 1984, and in 1985 moved to Los Angeles to pursue his film career.\n\nBerg put his acting aspirations on hold when he first arrived in Los Angeles, choosing instead to learn about the film business as a production assistant. He acted in \"21 Jump Street\" and \"Quiet Victory: The Charlie Wedemeyer Story\" (both in 1988). He acted in \"Never on Tuesday\", \"Miracle Mile\", \"Race For Glory\", \"Shocker\", \"Heart of Dixie\", \"Tale of Two Sisters\" and \"Going Overboard\" in 1989. He acted in \"Genuine Risk\" and \"Forradalom után\" in 1990. He appeared in \"Late for Dinner\" and \"Crooked Hearts\" in 1991. In the early 1990s, he appeared in \"A Midnight Clear\", \"A Case for Murder\", \"Fire in the Sky\", \"Aspen Extreme\", \"Across the Moon\", \"Uneviled\" and \"F.T.W.\"\n\nIn 1992, Berg gained recognition for playing a World War II soldier in the film \"A Midnight Clear\". In 1998, Berg made his feature directorial debut with \"Very Bad Things\", a black comedy starring Jon Favreau, Christian Slater, Jeremy Piven, Daniel Stern, and Leland Orser. The film, which was shown at the Toronto and San Sebastian Film Festivals, received mixed critical reception. In 2000, he created \"Wonderland\", an edgy dramatic television series set in an asylum. While the ABC show received rave reviews and garnered a cult following, it failed to deliver ratings and was quickly canceled.\n\nIn 2003, Berg directed the action comedy \"The Rundown\". Starring Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson and Seann William Scott, the film received positive reviews from critics but disappointed at the box office, only grossing 80 million of its reported 85 million budget. In 2004, Berg began work on his third directorial effort, \"Friday Night Lights\", a football film based on the New York Times bestseller written by Buzz Bissinger.\n\nIn 2006, Berg developed and became executive producer of NBC’s Peabody and Emmy Award-winning drama \"Friday Night Lights\", based on the novel and film of the same name.\n\nHe appeared in the war film \"Lions for Lambs\" (2007) as Lt. Colonel Falco. Berg followed up in 2007 with \"The Kingdom\", a Michael Mann-produced action-political thriller set in Saudi Arabia, starring Academy Award winners Jamie Foxx and Chris Cooper, also with Jennifer Garner whom Berg met when he appeared in a two-part episode of \"Alias\" where he played Garner's ex-boyfriend. Berg’s film \"Hancock\", starring Will Smith, Charlize Theron and Jason Bateman, was one of the highest grossing films of 2008.\n\nBerg directed the Hulu.com commercial featuring Alec Baldwin, which both The New York Times and Time magazine named best spot of Super Bowl XLIII. In 2009, Berg directed a two-hour pilot movie for a Fox television series \"Virtuality\". Even though the show was not picked up for a full season, the pilot was released on DVD exclusively through Best Buy. Berg also directed the ESPN documentary \"Kings Ransom\" in 2009. Berg also wrote the film \"The Losers\" (2010).\n\nBerg also directed the science-fiction/action film \"Battleship\" (2012) and the war film \"Lone Survivor\" (2013), an adaptation of Marcus Lutrell's book of the same name. \"Variety\" writer Justin Chang said Berg delivered \"his most serious-minded work to date with \"Lone Survivor\".\" Berg is developing a sequel to \"Hancock\" and producing a live-action version of the graphic novel \"\".\n\nIn 2013, Berg created the opening animation sequence for ESPN's \"Monday Night Football\". The 80-second graphic featured Darth Vader (from \"Star Wars\"), Pac-Man, President Ronald Reagan and some highlights of \"MNF\" games from 1970-2012. In 2014, he directed the first two episodes of HBO's \"The Leftovers\".\n\nIn 2016, Berg directed the film \"Deepwater Horizon\", based on the Deepwater Horizon explosion. Berg replaced director J. C. Chandor, who had exited the film due to creative differences. That same year, he directed CBS Films' \"Patriots Day\", about the Boston Marathon bombing. Mark Wahlberg starred in both films.\n\nIn 2017, Berg was asked to direct an ambitious commercial for \"Hyundai\", recorded after the kickoff of Super Bowl LI and aired right after the game.\n\nIn 1993, Berg was married to Elizabeth Rogers, an agent for Calvin Klein; they divorced in 1998. He had one child with her.\n\nOn July 15, 2015, Berg criticized ESPN's decision to honor Caitlyn Jenner with the Arthur Ashe Courage Award with an Instagram post in which he shared a Facebook photo of Army veteran Gregory D. Gadson (a double amputee who played a role in Berg’s \"Battleship\" film) alongside one of Jenner. It said: “One Man traded 2 legs for the freedom of the other to trade 2 balls for 2 boobs. Guess which Man made the cover of \"Vanity Fair\", was praised for his courage by President Obama and is to be honored with the ‘Arthur Ashe Courage Award’ by ESPN?” Along with the shared post, Berg commented, \"Yup.\"\n\nAfter Berg received significant criticism for the post, he later clarified his remarks, saying he had the utmost respect for Jenner and transgender individuals; however, he released another photo with statistics on veteran suicide, stating, “I also believe that we don’t give enough attention to our courageous returning war veterans, many of whom have sacrificed their bodies and mental health for our country and our principals [\"sic\"] – principals that include the freedom to live the life you want to live without persecution or abuse.”\n\nProducer only\n\n"}
{"id": "1896435", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896435", "title": "Faravid", "text": "Faravid\n\nFaravid was a legendary King of Kvenland who is mentioned in the Icelandic Egils saga from the early 13th century. According to the saga, Faravid made an alliance with the Norwegian Thorolf Kveldulfsson to fight against Karelian invaders.\n\nThe surviving version of the saga was written only in 1240, with possible later influences. The saga mentions Faravid in a 9th-century context, but this is thought to be by Kyösti Julku and Mikko Häme too early to be credible as far as the Karelian attack is concerned. It is more likely that such encounter with Kvens and Karelians would have taken place in the 12th century. Karelians only became active in Lapland in the 11th century onwards. However, prof. Unto Salo states that it is possible to time the description to the beginning of the 11th century. Furthermore, on the same raid Thorolf hears that the Kylfings, who might be Novgorodians, are harassing the Sami. Thorolf proceeds to look for the kylfings slays 30 Kylfings that he finds. Unto Salo notes that the Novgorodian annals mention that Novgorod made a raid to Tavastia in 1042. This could have been a revenge for the attacks on the Kylfings and the Karelians.\n\nIn the saga Thorolf goes to Finnmark in the winter with hundred men and meets \"in the far east\" with some Kvens that state they have been sent by their king Faravid. They tell Thorolf that the Karelians (Kiriales) are harassing their land. The king's message to Thorolf was that this should bear him help. Thorolf would have a share of the booty equal to the king's share, and each of his men as much as two Kvens.\n\"With the Kvens the law was that the king should have one-third as compared with his men when the booty was shared, and beyond that, as reserved for him, all bearskins and sables. Thorolf put this proposal before his men, giving them the choice to go or not; and the more part chose to venture it, as the prize was so great. Thus it was decided that they should go eastwards with the messengers.\"\n\nThorolf makes a pact with Faravid and they attack Karelia together with three hundred of the king's men and hundred Norsemen (or, if a hundare is 120 men, 360 and 120, respectively). According to the saga they went by the \"upper way\" over Finnmark, and found the Karelians . These were the same ones who had before harried the Kvens. The Karelians formed for battle and faced to meet the Kvens and the Norsemen, expecting a victory as before. But when the battle started, the Norsemen charged, having stronger bearing shields than those of the Kvens (and Karelians?). Many Karelians fell, and the rest fled. King Faravid and Thorolf gained a great victory and won lots of spoil, and returned to Kvenland. Afterwards Thorolf and his men came to Finmark, parting in friendship from Faravid and Kvens.\n\nNext winter Thorolf passed over the Keel mountains again with hundred men, went eastwards to Kvenland and met king Faravid. They took counsel together, and decided to go as in the winter before. With four hundred men they descended on Karelia (Kirialaland), and attacked those districts. Karelians matched the Kvens and the Norsemen in numbers. They took much booty, returning up to Finmark as the winter wore on.\n\nEgil's saga does not offer any details on Faravid. Only that he is the king of Kvenland and that he commands a troop of three hundare, perhaps 360 men, if the Kvens followed the tradition of Eastern Sweden. The saga naturally emphasises the role of the Norsemen in the raid and the battle but it is clear that the expedition was common. That Faravid was a \"king\" does not mean that he was necessarily a king of some realm but it does indicate that he was a chief comparable to a petty king, commanding his own troops.\n\nThe name Faravid is a Norse name, not Finnic, even though Kvens are generally thought to be Finnic. However, Faravid does not appear as a name in Scandinavia and it has been seen as a translation of Finnish \"Kaukomieli\" or \"Kaukamoinen\". Kaukomieli is also one of the names for the character of Lemminkäinen in the Kalevala, and Lemminkäinen himself is an amalgam of three folk poem heroes, Lemminkäinen, Kaukomieli and Ahti Saarelainen. The name Kaukomieli has been interpreted to mean \"far traveler\" or \"far longing\".\n\nSatakunta region in Finland, where Kvenland has commonly been situated by research, along with Southern Ostrobothnia, has many village names starting with Kauko-. These can be dated to be either late Iron Age or early middle age villages and thus would fit the timing of the saga's description of Faravid. Furthermore, the municipality of Köyliö has an example of \"Kaukamely\" used as a surname from a document dated 1422. Köyliö has rich Iron Age cemeteries and clearly was one of the centres of pre-historic Finland. For example, a burial dated to 1025-1150 in Köyliö's C-burial ground (also known as \"Lalli cemetery\"), on the island in Köyliönjärvi, includes a sword with silver plated hilt, silver decorated axe, two spear heads and a silver ring, among other items. Next to the island where the burial ground is situated, there is a smaller island of Kaukoluoto, which is thought to derive its name from the personal name of Kauko. The burials in Köyliö's C-burial ground are among the richest known in Finland.\n\nThus, it is possible that Faravid (even though this might have not been his real name) was a real chief in the region today known as Finland although there is no other mention of him.\n"}
{"id": "1896440", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896440", "title": "Battle of Gestilren", "text": "Battle of Gestilren\n\nThe Battle of Gestilren took place on July 17, 1210. The battle was fought between the exiled King of Sweden Sverker and the ruling King Eric X. Sverker had been beaten in the previous Battle of Lena, but returned with new forces. Sverker was however killed in the battle. The exact strength of the armies is unknown.\n\nSverker II had grown up in exile in Denmark and was accepted as king in 1195/96, to the detriment of the four sons of the previous King Canute I. He pursued a policy of strengthening the clerical estate, but ran into difficulties after twelve years of reign. The sole surviving son of Canute, Eric, was backed by the Birkebeiner party of Norway and ousted Sverker in 1207-08. Sverker sought assistance from King Valdemar the Victorious of Denmark and his powerful Danish in-laws. With a strong army he entered Västergötland in early 1208 but suffered a crushing defeat in the Battle of Lena. A very large part of the Danish army fell on the battlefield. Among the few survivors was Sverker himself who returned to Denmark. A later folksong emphasizes his determination and fatalism in the face of the disaster:\n\nPope Innocent III, impressed by Sverker's pro-papal policy, ordered Eric to settle the conflict with Sverker, or else take serious consequences. However, his admonitions did not have the desired effect. A new expedition was therefore equipped in Denmark in order to recapture the Swedish throne.\n\nIn the summer of 1210, Sverker once again invaded the Swedish kingdom where Eric had meanwhile adopted royal titles. The army came to a place called Gestilren where it was confronted by Eric's troops on 17 July (alternatively, 16 August). The available details about the battle are utterly meagre. The short chronicle of the Westrogothic law says that \"the Folkungs took his life; his own brother-in-law did it to him in Gestilren\". An annal entry informs us of \"warfare in Gestilren, on the 16th of August; there fell King Sverker and Folke Jarl, and many Folkungs.\" Thus the Swedish troops scored a victory in spite of great losses where one of their commanders, Folke Jarl, was slain. With the dramatic fall of Sverker, the war that had plagued Sweden for two and a half years came to an end, and peace was quickly concluded with Denmark. The banner that King Eric used in the battle was later bequeathed to Folke Jarl's nephew Eskil Magnusson, the lawspeaker of Västergötland, and bestowed on the Icelandic historian Snorri Sturluson in 1219.\n\nThe battle was a victory for the Folkung party of local autonomies, who acted against the centralising forces of Catholic monarchy. Sverker's nemesis Folke Jarl was probably a son of the powerful Jarl Birger Brosa (d. 1202) and the uncle of Birger Jarl, whose descendants ruled Sweden after 1250. If so, he was indeed a brother-in-law of Sverker. In early-modern historiography the royal branch of the clan was also called \"Folkungs\" which seems to be incorrect. The name may originally have alluded to the supporters of Folke Jarl at Gestilren, but then became the denomination for a party or faction. The party frequently opposed royal rule until they were defeated at the Battle of Sparrsätra in 1247, finally disappearing in c. 1280.\n\nThe location where this battle took place is the subject of a very long and very heated discussion between Swedish historians. Traditionally, the location was believed to be in Västergötland, where a monument () was erected in 1910 to commemorate the seven centuries since the battle. The main reason for the localization is a note in a 15th-century codex of the Westrogothic law, which says that the battle took place \"in Gaestilsreen between Dala and Lena\". The information implies that the field of slaughter was close to the scene of the 1208 battle. Historian Erik Lönnroth has argued that fighting took place \"in or close to the gorge between the Gerum Hill and the Varv Hill, since the only way to confront heavy, superior, feudal cavalry, was when it was impossible to surround you on the flanks, instead forming a stable spear formation against them\".\n\nOthers have argued that the battle took place in Östergötland, or that Gestilren should not be interpreted as a place name at all. Recently, archivist and historian Lars-Otto Berg has claimed that it was located at Gästre () in Uppland, Sweden, since he found the farm name \"Gestilren\" fifteen times in the local church records during the years 1580-1630. This is also close to the strongholds of the Folkung party. An annotation from the early 17th century records a local tradition suggesting a connection: \"King Sverker's three farms - in Tillinge Hiersten, in Försth. Gestilren, in Biskull Landzberg - he was buried in Gestilren in the Sverker Hill\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1896443", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896443", "title": "Overtaking", "text": "Overtaking\n\nOvertaking or passing is the act of one vehicle going past another slower moving vehicle, travelling in the same direction, on a road. The lane used for overtaking another vehicle is almost always a passing lane further from the road shoulder which is to the left in places that drive on the right and to the right in places that drive on the left.\n\nOn a single-carriageway/undivided-carriageway road, the lane used for overtaking is often the same lane that is used by oncoming traffic. An overtaking vehicle must be able to see clearly ahead of them for the entire overtaking manoeuvre plus a margin of error. For example, in New Zealand it's instructed in the Road Code that an overtaking driver must be able to see at least 100 metres of clear road in front of them as they finish the passing manoeuvre). In the UK, guidance for passing and overtaking is given in rules 162-169 of the Highway Code.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, the \"overtaking zone\" is indicated by a single broken centerline (yellow or white in most countries) if overtaking is allowed in either direction, or paired with a single solid line beside it to indicate there is no overtaking from the solid side. In the UK and New Zealand, the format of the centerline is not used to regulate overtaking, only to indicate whether crossing of the line is prohibited or permitted. In Australia, drivers can cross a solid centreline to overtake a cyclist.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, many national primary roads were upgraded in the 1990s and 2000s to \"wide two-lane\" road (two-lane road with space for three lanes, in addition to hard shoulders) to allow more space for overtaking (a very common manoeuvre in a country that had little dual carriageway until the early 2000s). However, due to the deceptive perception of safety given by such roads, future upgrade projects are likely to be 2+1 road where traffic volume suits (a successful pilot installation was used on the N20 near Mallow, County Cork). This form of road is of similar profile to wide two-lane, but includes a central crash barrier, and has three lanes, with an overtaking lane on one side or the other, alternating every 2 km. It has been used in Denmark and Sweden since the 1990s.\n\nOn a dual-carriageway/divided-carriageway highway/motorway or arterial road, any lane can be an overtaking lane though in many places (including Germany) undertaking (overtaking on the side furthest from the road centre line) is prohibited. Lanes are normally separated by broken lines (usually white) but may be a single solid white to indicate lane-changing is allowed but discouraged. Double lines indicate that lane-changing (for example to overtake) is prohibited, such as in tunnels or sometimes for HOV lanes and HOT lanes.\n\nOvertaking in an HOV or HOT lane is usually illegal for cars that do not meet the HOV/HOT criteria, except when directed by the police.\n\nA few places also use the one-broken/one-solid marking at slip roads/entrance ramps, to indicate to highway drivers that the new lane merges and does not continue, so they do not attempt to overtake in a lane that ends shortly. This is also used at other points where lanes merge.\n\nThe no-overtaking-sign looks a lot the same in most European countries, but its legal description differs between countries. Depending on the text of law, in some countries in Europe the no-overtaking-sign bans overtaking only for vehicles that have three or more wheels, effectively granting motorcycle drivers the freedom to overtake cars even past the no-overtaking-sign, where the same sign rules out overtaking for all types of vehicles in neighboring countries. In other jurisdictions, like the Netherlands, overtaking vehicles that have only 2 wheels is not forbidden, despite the no-overtaking sign. The law text 'overtaking vehicles on more than two wheels' allows for overtaking bicycles, of which there are many on Dutch roads.\n\nThe Netherlands has ruled out overtaking on 95% of their single carriageway primary road network. Statistics from before 1990 showed that many fatal accidents in the Netherlands were due to unsafe overtaking actions, where the speed of oncoming traffic was underestimated. During the 1990s a new road design was introduced, called 'Duurzaam Veilig' (Sustainable Safety). The philosophy behind the new road design was that the road had to protect its users against death or injury, by creating a design that has to eliminate common mistakes that often lead to accidents. This vision moves the responsibility for road safety away from the road users towards road designers. The 'Duurzaam Veilig'-road design created 3 categories of roads: roads meant for local access, regional distributor roads (called 'gebiedsontsluitingswegen', or GOW) and national through roads, each with their own type of lines on the edge of the road, so road users would be able to recognize what type of road they were on and behave accordingly. By strictly separating slow moving local traffic from faster moving through traffic, the 'Duurzaam Veilig'-project aimed at making roads safer through their design.\n\nOne of the new features on regional distributor roads (GOW) was a wide double centre line, often without interruption, designed to create more lateral space between two opposite directions of traffic and to stop people from overtaking. Designers of the wide double centre line wanted to create some room for human error, so that vehicles swerving towards the centre of the road would no longer immediately lead to fatal accidents. The idea behind the solid centre line was the thought that overtaking cars have to move into lanes with oncoming traffic, which was considered unsafe even on perfectly flat and straight stretches of road with proper visibility. People in favour of the 'Duurzaam Veilig'-project point out that it has succeeded in creating more safety, as the number of fatal accidents has gone down quite dramatically as 'Duurzaam Veilig' road design was rolled out across the Netherlands.\n\nCritics of the Dutch Sustainable Safety project complain that an overly safe road design has robbed Dutch drivers of their ability to think independently and correctly estimate when it is safe to overtake. Other critics point out that the idea behind the 'Duurzaam Veilig'-project, that all traffic on Dutch distributor roads (GOW) would move at the same speed of 80 km/h is barely a theory. In everyday life on Dutch regional GOW-roads there are quite a few (elderly or insecure) people moving at 60 or 70 km/h, thereby annoying drivers who want to drive the legal speed limit of 80 km/h or slightly over it. Some critics even go as far as saying that the 'Duurzaam Veilig'-project has raised aggression amongst frustrated drivers on Dutch roads, as it has robbed drivers from their freedom to legally overtake slower moving traffic. Haters of the 'Duurzaam Veilig'-project also point out that, as the double solid centre line gets largely ignored by faster drivers who overtake anyway, it is actually dangerous that drivers nowadays are taking an uninterrupted centre line on a Dutch regional GOW-road less serious than they would back in the days when solid lines would only be applied on dangerous spots. Opinions of critics of the 'Duurzaam Veilig'-project are mostly discussed at truck stops and on internet forums, in Dutch language, far away from decision-makers who proudly promote the Dutch Sustainable Safety project in English, to the rest of the world.\n\nIn countries bounded by Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, article 11 states that:\n\n\nLocal governments may introduce variations to the Convention.\n\nOvertaking on the inside or undertaking refers to the practice of overtaking a slower vehicle on a road using the lane that is curb side of the vehicle being passed; that is to say, a lane to the left of the vehicle in countries where driving is on the left, or a lane to the right of the vehicle in countries where driving is on the right. The practice of passing on the inside, therefore, usually only occurs on a motorway or other road where there is more than one lane in the same direction or when the width of the roads makes this possible (although there may be exceptions in the cases of contraflow bus lanes).\n\nMany countries consider overtaking on the inside dangerous and therefore designate it a driving offence, however, most countries make the distinction between involuntary undertaking (passing centre side vehicles in heavy traffic) as opposed to the deliberate attempt to pass a slower moving vehicle for one's own benefit.\n\n\nIn racing, the rules allow overtaking from either side. Generally, the sides are classified as inside and outside overtaking, depending on the position of the overtaking car at the next curve since start of overtaking. The defending car usually blocks inside overtaking, because outside overtaking is riskier than inside overtaking.\n\n\n\n"}

After research in secret Soviet archives (both before and after the dissolution of the union), he published biographies of Joseph Stalin and Vladimir Lenin, among others. Despite being a committed Stalinist and Marxist–Leninist ideologue for most of his career, Volkogonov came to repudiate communism and the Soviet system within the last decade of his life before his death from cancer in 1995.\n\nThrough his research in the restricted archives of the Soviet Central Committee, Volkogonov discovered facts that contradicted the official Soviet version of events, and the cult of personality that had been built up around Lenin and Stalin. Volkogonov published books that contributed to the strain of liberal Russian thought that emerged during Glasnost in the late 1980s and the post-Soviet era of the early 1990s.\n\nDmitry Volkogonov was born March 22, 1928 in Chita, Eastern Siberia. Dmitry was the son of a collective farm manager and a schoolteacher. In 1937 when Dmitry was eight, his father was arrested and shot during Stalin's purges for being found in possession of a pamphlet by Bukharin. This was something Dmitry only found out years later while doing his own research in the restricted archives in Moscow. His mother was sent to a labor camp, where she died during World War II. The family was \"exiled to Krasnoyarsk in Western Siberia: Volkogonov joked that as they were already in the Far East, and Stalin was not in the habit of sending his political prisoners to Hawaii, they had to be sent west.\"\n\nVolkogonov entered the military at the age of seventeen in 1945, which was common for many orphans. He studied at the Lenin Military-Political Academy in Moscow in 1961, transferring to the Soviet Army's propaganda department in 1970. There he wrote propaganda pamphlets and manuals on psychological warfare and gained a reputation as a hardliner.\n\nIt was as early as the 1950s, while a young Army officer, that Volkogonov first discovered information that created cognitive dissonance within himself. While reading early journals of Party members from the 1920s, Volkogonov realized \"how stifled and sterile political debate in the Soviet Union had become in comparison to the early days.\" Khrushchev's 1956 secret speech further solidified this thought within him, but he kept these thoughts to himself at that time.\n\nDuring the decades that Volkogonov headed the Department of Special Propaganda, he visited Angola, Ethiopia, the Middle East and Afghanistan. He \"enjoyed a rapid rise in the Soviet Army as a specialist in charge of psychological and ideological warfare. Only a fully committed Communist could qualify for these posts, and he earned his credentials by grinding out propagandistic and agitational screeds.\" \"But even as he was indoctrinating troops in Communist orthodoxy, General Volkogonov was struggling with private doubts based on the horrors he discovered hidden in the archives\". Volkogonov also had the opportunity to view the conditions of various client states during the Cold War. While these countries received military aid, Volkogonov later recalled, \"...they all became poorer; their economies were collapsing everywhere. And I came to the conclusion that the Marxist model was a real historic blind alley, and that we, too, were caught in a historic trap.\"\n\nVolkogonov was a fervent ideologue until the end of the 1970s, and devoted his energy to spreading Marxism–Leninism within the military. Only with the most impeccable communist credentials did Volkogonov access the most secret Soviet archives. While reading in the archives during the Brezhnev years, Volkogonov \"found documents that astounded him — papers that revealed top Communists as cruel, dishonest and inept\". Thus, while Volkogonov was actively writing and editing Soviet propaganda materials for troops, \"[he] was engaged in a lengthy, tortured but very private process of re-evaluating Soviet history.\"\n\nVolkogonov began writing the biography of Stalin in 1978. He completed it by 1983, but it was banned by the Central Committee. It was published under Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of Glasnost before the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The publication of the book on Stalin within Russia made Volkogonov \"a pariah among his fellow senior officers\".\n\nAlthough Volkogonov approached Lenin in the Stalin biography in a rather conventional way, he was passionate in his indictment of the Stalinist system. As he later remarked, \"It immediately made me many enemies.\"\n\n\"Volkogonov admitted publicly that, like many senior Soviet officials, he had lived two mental lives, rising higher and higher in his career while burrowing deeper in the archives, as if symbolically undermining the system that had nurtured him.\"\n\nHe had been director of the Institute of Military History since 1985, where he was heavily involved in research and writing. While there, Volkogonov compiled a two-volume collection of data on 45,000 Red Army officers who were arrested during the purges of the 1930s, in which 15,000 were shot.\n\nWhile the Stalin biography caused friction, everything really came to a head in June 1991, when he was forced to resign. Volkogonov had shown the other senior officers at the Institute a draft of the first volume of a 10-volume official Soviet history of World War II. In it, Volkogonov criticized Stalin's management of the war and his liquidation of Soviet officers.\n\nOne British historian, summarizing Volkogonov's criticisms of Stalin's military role in World War II, then notes that \"a number of officers at the Institute of Military History who had fought on the Eastern Front were critical of Volkogonov's writings on the war because he had never set foot on a battlefield. He was, they said, an 'armchair-general'.\"\n\n\"Accused of blackening the name of the army, as well as that of the Communist Party and the Soviet state, and personally attacked by Minister of Defense Yazov,\" and under pressure from Gorbachev, Volkogonov resigned.\n\nAfter the failed 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt by communist hardliners in August 1991, followed by the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991, Volkogonov became the special adviser for defence issues to the Russian President Boris Yeltsin.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Volkogonov was \"the chairman of the commission investigating the hitherto unknown fates of allied prisoners of war in Soviet camps, chairman of the parliamentary committee for KGB and Communist Party archives.\" The second parliamentary committee released 78 million files to public access. As part of this process, Volkogonov was able to personally review \"many documents of the Communist Party Central Committee and the Politburo.\" This declassification of state and Party papers allowed historians access which had never been allowed going back to the early formation of the Soviet Union seventy years before.\n\nWhen notice of Volkogonov's research became known in the West, inquiries came to him from Alger Hiss and his lawyer in the United States. In 1948, Hiss had been accused of being a spy for the Soviet Union. When Hiss's lawyer contacted Volkogonov to check the KGB archives for record of Hiss as a spy, \"The New York Times\" reported: \"Not a single document, and a great amount of materials has been studied, substantiates the allegation that Mr. A. Hiss collaborated with the intelligence services of the Soviet Union,\" the official, Gen. Dmitry A. Volkogonov, chairman of the Russian Government's military intelligence archives, declared. He called the espionage accusations against Mr. Hiss \"completely groundless.\"\n\nLater Volgokonov took issue with what amounted to exoneration of Hiss. In a \"New York Times\" article entitled \"Russian General Retreats on Hiss,\" Volkogonov clarified: I was not properly understood... The Ministry of Defense also has an intelligence service, which is totally different, and many documents have been destroyed. I only looked through what the K.G.B. had. All I said was that I saw no evidence.\"\n\nResponding to Volkogonov's last remarks, Hiss himself stated: \"If he and his associates haven't examined all the files, I hope they will examine the others, and they will show the same thing.\"\n\nVolkogonov co-chaired a U.S.-Russia Joint Commission on Prisoners of War, \"and continued, always, to write.\" Volkogonov fell out of favor with Yeltsin in 1994, after opposing the use of force to solve ethnic disputes within areas of the former Soviet Union. Specifically, Volkogonov felt that Yeltsin was taking \"the advice of wrong-headed counselors\" in deciding to invade Chechnya.\n\nAlthough Volkogonov began intensive research into Lenin beginning in 1990, by the late 1980s he was actually already arriving at his own conclusion regarding Lenin's role.\n\nLenin's archives were housed in the former Central Committee building on Moscow's Staraya Square. Deep in the basement of the huge grey building were shelves holding metal boxes that contained all the written records associated with Lenin. Volkogonov explained, \"As I saw more and more closed Soviet archives, as well as the large Western collections at Harvard University and the Hoover Institution in California, Lenin's profile altered in my estimation\".\n\nVolkogonov always used to say \"that in his own mind, Lenin was the last bastion to fall.\" He said that the turning point was when he discovered one of Lenin's orders calling for the public hanging of Kulak peasants in 1918:\nWhen Volkogonov's editor for the English editions of his books, Harold Shukman, first met him in Oxford, England in 1989, he found Volkogonov to be \"utterly unlike [his] idea of a Soviet general.\" Shukman explained: \"He did not strut or swagger, or drink or smoke, and in the many different situations in which I was to see him — in other countries, in Russia, with academics, etc., he was invariably easy-going and relaxed, and plainly popular.\"\n\nBy the end of his life, Volkogonov had \"firmly committed himself to the view that Russia's only hope in 1917 lay in the liberal and social democratic coalition that emerged in the February Revolution.\" Volkogonov told his editor that the \"spiritual strength\" that he displayed in his last years was derived from undergoing a Christian baptism.\nAs one \"Los Angeles Times\" writer described Volkogonov: \"For exposing truths and exploding myths, Volkogonov was often accused of treason and treachery. But he never retreated.\" Volkogonov was under tremendous pressures at the time. For instance he related that when he would enter the Russian Parliament (where he had held a seat as a liberal since the Gorbachev era), he would be met by Communist legislators who would \"line up at the door and shout insults.\" Of this Volkogonov commented at the time, \"I take these shouts as sounds of historical praise.\"\n\n\"Despite his undergoing extensive surgery for colon and liver cancer\" in 1991, the pace of both his political activity and the publication of his writings increased sharply.\n\nDuring the August 1991 coup attempt in which a hardliners attempted to wrest control from Gorbachev in an attempt to reassert the Communist Party's power in the Soviet Union, Volkogonov was in a hospital in London. When Volkogonov saw the news of the coup on television, he said to his editor, \"So, they've done it.\" Defense Minister Dmitry Yazov, who had fired Volkogonov from the Institute three months earlier, had told him, \"something will happen to get rid of the likes of you.\" From his hospital bed Volkogonov broadcast an appeal on the BBC to the Soviet army to not obey the orders of the coup leaders.\n\nVolkogonov was the co-chairman of Task Force Russia, an American Russian organization tasked with finding American POWs in Russia. He told a US Senate committee that 730 American airmen had been captured on Cold War spy flights.\nVolkogonov died from cancer in December 1995 at the age of 67. His family donated his papers to the United States Library of Congress.\n\nVolkogonov is most famous for his trilogy \"Leaders\" (Вожди, or Vozhdi), which consists of the three books about: Vladimir Lenin (\"Lenin: A New Biography\", 1994); Leon Trotsky (\"Trotsky: The Eternal Revolutionary\", 1992); and Joseph Stalin (\"Stalin: Triumph and Tragedy\").\n\nHe also finished just before his death \"Autopsy for an Empire: the Seven Leaders Who Built the Soviet Regime\" (Russian title: \"Sem Vozhdei\"). The book presents chapters on \"the seven leaders of the Soviet Union: Lenin, Stalin, Khrushchev, Brezhnev, Andropov, Chernenko and Gorbachev.\" Volkogonov was in the Soviet Army during the reign of six of the seven leaders, and he had \"direct working contact\" with four of those leaders in his role as a colonel-general. The English editions were essentially condensed versions of the much longer Russian originals, as acknowledged by their translator and editor Harold Shukman.\n\n\n"}

A Forest Service campground in the Poudre Canyon in the Roosevelt National Forest northwest of Fort Collins is named for him.\n\nAnsel was born November 1, 1835, in Conquinbroom County, New York, the eldest of six children of Oron and Jane Watrous. Oron was a brother of William Watrous, who would settle in Fort Collins in 1871, where Ansel, his nephew, would join him years later. The Watrous family came from England in colonial times. They and their descendants were prominent in the affairs of war and peace in Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and New York, during the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812 and the Indian Wars.\n\nAnsel was named for his paternal grandfather, a country squire of Susquehanna, Pennsylvania. \n\nHis father moved his family to Brotherton, Wisconsin, but in two years he died of cholera and the family moved to New York State. At seventeen Ansel, having had some education at a private academy, was apprenticed to a carpenter. At 20 he returned to Wisconsin, and on Christmas Day 1856 married Floral Thompson of Stockbridge, Wisconsin. He followed his trade of contracting and building and also taught school. He had an interest in politics, being elected to the position of Sheriff in 1860 and in 1864 as a county clerk. \n\nIn December 1877 he took the first step toward moving to Fort Collins, making a four-day trip on the Colorado Central Railroad. He was met by his uncle Willian F. Watrous and taken to the Watrous home on Myrtle Street. He had arrived on December 30 and on the first of January went to work for W.C. Stover at his store. He was forty-two and had left a settled community where he was known and respected to move to a frontier town with few houses or trees and with only boardwalks alongside muddy streets. He sensed, however, the excitement of a frontier town. The sound of sawing and hammering and the site of wagons loaded with building materials and streets crowded with all sorts of people told him the town was on the move. \n\nIt isn't clear when his wife, Floral Thompsen Watrous, left her close-knit family in Wisconsin for what became a lonely life on the frontier. She found it difficult to adjust and wrote of her loneliness to her family but stayed to make her husband a home writing, \"I can never be happy away from him.\" \n\nWatrous lost no time in establishing himself. By June 1877 he was the co-founder of a newspaper the \"Fort Collins Courier\". His partner, Elmer Felton, had some newspaper experience and Watrous had some knowledge of printing, as it had once been his father's trade. The \"Fort Collins Courier\" had a difficult founding. The men worked with an old Washington Hand Press, which was in poor condition, nor did they have enough type. The press was good for only a seven - column format. That problem was solved by having two pages of the paper printed in Chicago and shipped by rail to Fort Collins where it was joined with two pages of local news. This despite the paper's motto of \"home first, the world afterwards.\" In early 1879 they finally had enough type to print the whole paper locally. \n\nA columnist for a later paper, the \"Express Courier\", called the paper \"a fiery, Democratic newspaper in a hostile and smugly vindictive community noted for its conservative posture.\" In November 1880 the paper was expanded to eight columns and two years later, with a new power press, a daily edition was started. Watrous bought Felton out at this time and was the sole proprietor and editor until 1886, when he sold the paper to the Courier Printing and Publishing Company. He stayed on as president and editor, even when the paper was again sold, this time to a Republican. \n\nIn 1881 Watrous was appointed to the town board of trustees. He tried politics in 1882 and 1884 as the Democratic candidate for state auditor but was defeated both times. He was appointed Postmaster from 1885–1889, during the Cleveland administration. In 1889 Watrous served on the board of directors for the new Public Library Association. \n\nIn November 1878 Watrous got his first full view of the Rocky Mountains. He'd gone with his uncle in a spring wagon to get firewood to a place west of the Batterson Ranch. \"Nothing exciting about the ride,\" he wrote, \"but I was delighted with the view of snow-capped peaks in the distance with the panorama of rock rested and timbered covered hills which unrolled itself to our gaze. It was my first view of the Rocky Mountains. A view I had longed for, and I shall never forget that day's ride.\" \n\nHis love of the region would inspire him to write the \"History of Larimer County, Colorado\", which he completed in 1910.\n\nWatrous was buried in Grandview Cemetery, Fort Collins.\n"}

{"id": "1896480", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896480", "title": "Machine de Marly", "text": "Machine de Marly\n\nThe Machine de Marly, also known as the Marly Machine or the Machine of Marly, was a large hydraulic system in Yvelines, France, built in 1684 to pump water from the river Seine and deliver it to the Palace of Versailles.\n\nKing Louis XIV needed a large water supply for his fountains at Versailles. Before the Marly Machine was built, the amount of water delivered to Versailles already exceeded that used by the city of Paris, but this was insufficient, and fountain-rationing was necessary. Ironically most of the water pumped by the Marly Machine ended up being used to develop a new garden at the Château de Marly. However, even if all the water pumped at Marly (an average of 3,200 cubic metres per day, or 845,351 gallons per day) had been supplied to Versailles, it still would not have been enough: the fountains running \"à l'ordinaire\" (that is, at half pressure) required at least four times as much.\n\nThe Machine de Marly, based on a prototype at the Château de Modave, consisted of fourteen gigantic water wheels, each roughly 11.5 meters or 38 feet in diameter, that powered more than 250 pumps to bring water up a hillside from the Seine River to the Louveciennes Aqueduct. Louis XIV had countless schemes and inventions that were supposed to bring water to his fountains. The Machine de Marly was by far his most extensive and costly plan. After three years of construction and a cost of approximately 5,500,000 livres, the massive contraption, considered the most complex of the 17th century, was completed. \"The chief engineer for the project was Arnold de Ville and the 'contractor' was Rennequin Sualem (after whom the quai by the machine is now named).\" Both men had experience in pumping water from coal mines in the region of Liège (in modern Belgium).\n\nThe machine suffered from frequent breakdowns, required a permanent staff of sixty to maintain and often required costly repairs — but functioned for 133 years. Destroyed in 1817, it was replaced by a \"machine temporaire\" during 10 years and then a steam engine entered in service from 1827 to 1859. From 1859 to 1963, the pumping at Marly was assumed by another hydraulic machine conceived by the engineer Xavier Dufrayer. Dufrayer's machine was scrapped in 1968 and replaced by electromechanical pumps.\n\nFrom the beginning, the construction of the château and the park of Versailles water supply had posed a problem. The site chosen by Louis XIV, a former hunting lodge of Louis XIII, was far removed from any river and high in elevation. The sovereign's will to have a park with more and more basins, water jets and fountains became a hallmark of his reign by the extension and improvement of a permanent water supply system with the construction of new pumps, aqueducts and reservoirs to collect ever more water, from a greater and greater distance.\n\nThe idea to bring water from the Seine to Versailles had always been under consideration. But more than just the distance - the river is located nearly 10 km from the château - there was the problem of the elevation to ascend, nearly 150 meters (490 feet). Since 1670, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Louis XIV's Superintendent of the King's Buildings, had opposed several projects, including one proposed by , both for reasons of feasibility and that of cost.\n\nBut Arnold de Ville (1653-1722), a young and ambitious bourgeois of Huy in the Province of Liège, who had already built a pump in Saint-Maur, succeeded in submitting to the king his project for pumping the waters of the River Seine to the Château of Val in the forest of Saint-Germain, demonstrating that the same could be done to supply Versailles. This machine, a sort of small scale model of what the Machine of Marly could be, impressed the king, who then entrusted him with the development of a machine on the Seine to supply not only the gardens of Versailles, but also those of the Chateau of Marly then under construction.\n\nThe Machine de Marly site is located 7 km (4.4 mi) north of the Château de Versailles and 16.3 km (10.2 mi) west of the center of Paris, on the Seine in the Yvelines department. The river pumps and administration buildings are located in what is now the town of Bougival; relay pumps, machinery, the aqueduct and reservoirs are located in Louveciennes. One reservoir is in the town of Marly-le-Roi.\n\nBetween Port-Marly and Bezons, the Seine, along its length, was divided into two arms by a series of islands and earth berms linked together by timber/rock dikes to form two disconnected, parallel river beds over ten kilometers in length. The hydraulic pumping machinery, propelling the river water to the top of the hill that borders the Seine, was constructed across from the left arm of the river, a little below the small village of La Chaussée, downstream of Bougival.\n\nTo design and build this machine, Arnold de Ville, who did not have the technical skills, appealed to two men from Liège, the master carpenter and mechanic Rennequin Sualem (1645-1708) and his brother Paulus. He had already worked with them on a pump at the Château de Modave and Rennequin Sualem was the designer of the pump at the Château de Val. The entire project – channeling and dikes on the Seine, construction of the machine and the network of aqueducts and basins – would last for 6 years. The chosen site on the Seine would later become the town of Bougival (at the location of the current locks of Bougival).\n\nAbout 7 kilometers upstream, Colbert channeled a portion of the Seine by linking several islands with dikes from the island of Bezons and separating the river into two arms, a western arm for navigation and an eastern arm destined to supply the machine by creating a constriction and a drop of about three meters to power the 14 paddle wheels of the machine. The construction mobilized 1800 workers and required more than 100,000 tons of wood, 17,000 tons of iron and 800 tons of lead and as much cast iron. The wood used in the construction of the platform and the wheels of the machine, and for the dikes between the islands and for the buildings came from the surrounding forests. The iron for rods came from the Nivernais and Champagne and most of the cast iron pipe was produced in Normandy.\n\nA large number of Walloons came to work on the project. They possessed a know-how acquired from their work on water evacuation from mines. Many defected as well because of the economic difficulties encountered then in Wallonia, which had been ravaged by wars. Illiterate, the Sualem brothers were from a family of master carpenters from the mines of Liège. They were the only ones to have mastered the mechanism for remote power transmission, the flatrod system necessary for the proper functioning of the machine of Marly. The Walloon craftsmen went on to become the primary maintenance men essential for the enormous task of keeping the machine in working order.\n\nThe work began in June 1681 with the canalization of the Seine. The construction of the machine began at the end of 1681. On June 14, 1682, a successful demonstration was held in the presence of Louis XIV. The water could be elevated to the top of the hillside. The machine was inaugurated June 13, 1684 by the king and his court. The aqueduc de Louveciennes was completed in 1685 and the entire project, three years later, in 1688.\n\nThe total cost of the project was 5.5 million livres tournois (over 100 million dollars 2015 ). It included the construction of the machine itself (3,859,583 livres), buildings, aqueducts and water basins, the supply of materials, and the wages of the workers and artisans. (Rennequin Sualem was the best paid with 1800 pounds per year.). After the end of the work and the successful demonstration, Rennequin Sualem was appointed First Engineer of the King by Louis XIV and knighted. To the king, who asked him how he had had the idea of this machine, Rennequin answered in Walloon: \"Tot tuzant, Sire\" (\"By thinking hard, Sire\"). Arnold de Ville earned a great deal of money from the success of the machine and was able to rise into the aristocracy.\n\nThe engraving illustrated here describes the functioning of the machine as follows:\n\nTHE MACHINE OF MARLY is built on an arm of the Seine river. It consists of 14 wheels of 30 feet [11.9 m; 39 English feet] in diameter, the axles of which have two cranks, one which moves the pistons which push the water into the pipes and raise it up to the first reservoir; the other moves a system of crossarm levers which run the length of the mountain up to the highest reservoir. These crossarms power the pumps which are in the reservoirs and pump the water from the lower reservoir to the upper and from there to the top of the tower which is at the summit of the mountain, from where it runs over a large aqueduct which feeds different pipes to furnish all the waters of Versailles and Marly.\"\n\nPumping technology of the era of Louis XIV did not allow the delivery of water from the Seine to the top of the aqueduct of Louveciennes, an elevation differential of more than 150 meters (490 feet) in just one stage, so two intermediate pump relay stations were built, one at 48 meters (156 feet) and another at 99 meters (322 feet) above the river. Pumps in the relay locations were powered by two sets of oscillating timber and metal tie-rod linkages, driven by the river paddle wheels. A reservoir at each station buffered the water supply for each level of pumps.\n\nSome remnants of Dufrayer's machine are still visible today, but little remains of the original 17th-century masterpiece built by the Sualem brothers, de Ville and Louis XIV.\n\nThe overgrown walls of the mid-slope reservoir are visible on the hillside, just adjacent to the cobblestone path that runs straight up the incline. The paving stones on this 17th century service road are set with their top edges slightly exposed to allow better traction for the horses which hauled loads uphill.\n\nTwo administration buildings from the original Machine complex of 1684 still exist next to the Seine.\n\nThe building which housed the steam-driven pumping machine from 1825 can still be seen next to the river as well.\n\nAn engraving of the Paris Observatory from the beginning of the eighteenth century shows the wooden \"Marly tower\" on the right, a dismantled part of the Machine de Marly (the temporary tower replaced by La tour du Levant at the beginning of the Aqueduc de Louveciennes), moved to the Paris Observatory by astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini for mounting long telescopes.\n\n\n"}

Roughly a million people - about ten times the town's population - visit the event, making the Bergkirchweih together with Oktoberfest in Munich, Gäubodenvolksfest in Straubing, Michaeliskirchweih in Fürth and Volksfest in Nuremberg one of the great five in Bavaria.\n\nA common tradition during Berg is the so-called \"Kastenlauf\" (crate walk). In this one buys a crate of beer (20 bottles each 1/2 litre) and walks to the Berg carrying it. At the end of the walk the crate must be empty. This is related to the tradition of pre-gaming.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1896500", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896500", "title": "Lúcio", "text": "Lúcio\n\nLucimar Ferreira da Silva (born 8 May 1978), commonly known as Lúcio, is a Brazilian former footballer who played as a central defender. A tall and physically strong defender who excelled in the air, Lucio was known for his long, surging, galloping runs on the ball, which earned him the nickname \"O Cavalo\" (\"The Horse\", in Portuguese).\n\nLúcio began his professional career in 1998 with Sport Club Internacional. After three years in the club, he moved to Bayer Leverkusen, where he reached the 2002 Champions League final against Real Madrid of Spain. He scored a header in the final, which Real Madrid won with the score of 2–1. In 2004, he arrived at Bayern Munich, where he won three Cups and three Bundesliga titles. Since coach Louis van Gaal did not have a place for him at Bayern, he decided to search for a new team. He moved to Inter Milan in the summer of 2009. He won the treble with Inter in 2010, helped them win the 2010 Champions League against his former club Bayern Munich.\n\nWith Brazil, Lúcio has accumulated a number of significant accomplishments, winning the 2002 World Cup, 2005 Confederations Cup and 2009 Confederations Cup. After the retirement of Kaká, he was the last active player of the 2002 winning team.\n\nLúcio started playing football for his hometown club Planaltina as a forward. In 1997, now playing as a defender, he was loaned to Guará, then current Campeonato Brasiliense champions, for their match against Internacional for 1997 Copa do Brasil. Despite a 0–7 home loss, he impressed the Porto Alegre club and was purchased.\n\nAt Internacional, Lúcio later became a starting centre-back and had his best year in 2000, receiving his first call-up to the Brazil national football team and being awarded the Bola de Prata as one of the two best centre-backs of the 2000 Campeonato Brasileiro.\n\nIn January 2001, he moved to Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen. The following season was bittersweet for Leverkusen, as the club surrendered a five-point lead atop the Bundesliga by losing two of its last three matches while Borussia Dortmund swept ahead with three consecutive victories in the final matches to finish a point ahead of Leverkusen. They also experienced defeat in the DFB-Pokal Final, losing 4–2 to Schalke 04, and in the 2002 UEFA Champions League Final against Real Madrid, in which Lúcio cancelled out Raúl's eighth-minute goal just five minutes later with a header, only for Zinedine Zidane to give Real a 2–1 win with a sublime volley just before half-time. Despite the disappointing end to the season, Lúcio's impressive individual displays drew the attention of several of Europe's top clubs. In July 2003, Roma made an official bid, but the deal fell through.\n\nIn 2004, Lúcio joined Bayern Munich on a six-year contract, where he became a vital part of the team. Following Oliver Kahn's retirement in 2008, Dutchman Mark van Bommel was named club captain with Lúcio as vice-captain. When Bayern were playing against Real Madrid in the Round of 16 in the 2006–07 Champions League, Lúcio scored. The goal was in the 66th minute, while the score was 1–0 in favour of Bayern. The goal took Bayern through to the quarter-finals, where they lost to eventual champions Milan. In the 2008–09 DFB-Pokal, he scored in the quarter-finals against his former club, Bayer Leverkusen. Bayern were already down 3–0 when he scored, and even though Miroslav Klose scored again, Lúcio's goal did not matter as Stefan Kießling scored again to win it for Leverkusen 4–2.\n\nOn 16 July 2009, Lúcio moved to Italian club Inter Milan, signing a three-year contract with the Serie A champions. He was given the number 6 shirt. He scored his first goal with Inter on 23 September 2009 against Napoli with a header from a corner kick. Lúcio also scored an own goal in the UEFA Champions League in the group stages against Dynamo Kyiv, resulting in a draw. Throughout the season, both Lúcio and his defensive partner Walter Samuel drew praise for their performances, and on 22 May, Lúcio was in the Inter team that won the Champions League by defeating his former club Bayern Munich 2–0, to seal a historic treble and end a 45-year wait to be crowned European Champions. On 24 September 2011, Lúcio made his 100th appearance in an Inter shirt, scoring the third of a 3–1 win at Bologna in Serie A matchday 5. On 29 June 2012, it was announced that Lúcio would be leaving Inter following a mutual agreement to terminate the final two years of his contract.\n\nOn 4 July 2012, Lúcio signed a two-year contract with Serie A titleholders Juventus, adding him to the list of players to play for both Inter and Juventus. Although he was initially used as a starter in the club's three-man defence, featuring in Juventus's 4–2 victory over Napoli in the 2012 Supercoppa Italiana on 11 August, after struggling with injuries and producing some inconsistent performances, he was soon left out of the first-team in favour of the defensive trio of Giorgio Chiellini, Leonardo Bonucci and Andrea Barzagli. In total, he made only four appearances in all competitions during his next sixth months with the club: one in Serie A, two in the Champions League, and one in the Supercoppa Italiana. Due to this lack of playing time, Lúcio left Juventus on 17 December 2012, after his contract was terminated by mutual consent.\n\nOn 18 December 2012, one day after leaving Juventus, Lúcio signed for a two-year contract with Brazilian side São Paulo. After 12 years in Europe, he said that he needed to familiarize himself again with Brazil. He scored his first goal for São Paulo against Botafogo on 7 April 2013.\n\nIn July 2013, after a change of coaches in club – Ney Franco was replaced for Paulo Autuori – Lúcio was removed from team. The episode gained force after the 1–0 loss against Internacional, in a Brazilian League match. Lúcio did not accept Paulo Autuori's criticism, that the \"Colorado\" goal, scored by Leandro Damião, would have been scored after a fail from former captain of Seleção Brasileira. This way, reporting an insubordination, Autuori preferred to take off Lúcio from his staff.\n\nAfter his removal, Lúcio did not travel with the club to Germany to contest the 2013 Audi Cup. His presence at the friendly tournament was requested by his former club Bayern Munich, and without him São Paulo earned €40,000 less than initially accorded. The German side understood the explanations of the directors of the Brazilian club about the insubordination issues, but insisted on São Paulo's performance of contract.\n\nTraining apart from the main staff, Lúcio has become a \"problem\" to the club. He did not accept playing offers from clubs of Middle East and Japan, preferring to stay in Brazil, and did not receive proposals from other Brazilian teams. The directors of \"Tricolor\" did not want to sign his rescission, claiming about the high value to do this, however Lúcio was still earning a lucrative salary despite not playing. With defenders Antônio Carlos and Roger Carvalho arriving at the club, Lúcio effectively lost his chance at playing again, prompting efforts from São Paulo to transfer him to a European club before the transfer window closes; they were unsuccessful. In December 2013, after almost six months, Lúcio broke the silence and spoke about his poor relationship with the club: \"I felt humiliated. I thought \"Oh, my god, what did I do to deserve this?\"\n\nOn 1 January 2014, Lúcio broke his contract with São Paulo (originally to last until December 2014) and signed with \"Tricolor\"'s rivals Palmeiras. Following the departure of former team captain and centre-back Henrique, an idol for the club, Lúcio will now play a major leadership role on the team's defensive group, alongside goalkeeper and current team captain Fernando Prass. Upon signing his contract, Lúcio agreed to only earn a third of the salary he had in at São Paulo, being further compensated through prizes based on his performance on the field.\n\nOn 7 June 2015, it was confirmed that Lúcio had signed for FC Goa of the Indian Super League as their marquee player. He made 14 appearances in his first season, as FC Goa finished as runners-up of the league. The following season was a lot less successful, with just five appearances from Lúcio and FC Goa finishing at the bottom of the table.\n\nOn 7 December 2017, Lúcio returned to his home district in Brazil and signed for Gama, captaining the club during the 2018 Campeonato Brasiliense. On 16 April 2018, Lúcio joined rivals Brasiliense.\n\nLúcio announced his retirement as a professional footballer on 29 January 2020.\n\nAt junior level, he played for Brazil in the football tournament in the 2000 Olympics.\n\nIn the 2002 FIFA World Cup quarter-final match against England, Lúcio made a mistake that allowed Michael Owen to score the opening goal. Luiz Felipe Scolari defended him, stating that he had made no other mistakes. In the final against Germany, Lúcio bore the full brunt of a free-kick, but managed to stay on his feet to complete playing all 630 minutes of the tournament. He was one of three players to do so along with goalkeeper Marcos and right-back captain Cafu.\n\nIn the 2006 World Cup, Lúcio set a FIFA-record by playing 386 consecutive minutes without committing a foul, a streak which was finally broken in Brazil's 1–0 quarter-final loss to France.\n\nIn August 2006, Lúcio was appointed as captain by Brazil manager Dunga.\n\nLúcio's next international tournament was 2009 Confederations Cup. On 28 June 2009, the Brazilian captain scored the game-winning goal in the 84th minute for Brazil in the final of the Confederations Cup against the United States. Lúcio converted on a header from an Elano corner-kick, which beat American goalkeeper Tim Howard.\n\nThe 2010 World Cup was Lúcio's third World Cup. He played in the \"Seleção\"'s first match against North Korea on 15 June 2010, leading his team to a narrow 2–1 win. In the tournament, he partnered Juan in defence. In Group E, Brazil won against the Ivory Coast and played a 0–0 draw against Portugal, which was enough to lead Brazil to the knockout stage. Chile was beaten by Brazil, 3–0, and the \"Seleção\" made it to the quarter-finals. There Brazil faced the Netherlands, where Wesley Sneijder scored twice for Netherlands to eliminate Brazil after a 2–1 scoreline.\n\nAfter head coach Dunga was sacked, the Brazil Football Confederation hired Mano Menezes as the side's new head coach. Menezes also had faith in the experienced Lúcio, who kept his starting centre-back role in the team. Even though Lúcio kept his place, his centreback partner Juan was dropped from the Brazilian squad, and Thiago Silva was Lúcio's new partner.\n\nOn 4 June 2011, Lúcio played his 100th game for Brazil, which consists of 98 official caps and two unofficial caps in friendly matches against Spanish club Sevilla in 2005 and against Swiss club Luzern in 2006.\n\nLúcio was also named in Brazil's squad for 2011 Copa América. Brazil barely survived the group stage and in the quarter-finals the team faced Paraguay, which eliminated Brazil after penalty shootout.\n\nTowards the end of 2011, Menezes dropped Lúcio from the Brazil's squad, and Robinho became the new team captain. Lúcio made his last appearance for Brazil in September 2011.\n\nRegarded as one of the best defenders of his generation, Lúcio is a tall, large, tenacious, and physically strong defender, who excels in the air, and is known for his heavy marking of opponents, as well as his hard-tackling style of play and leadership; he is also highly regarded for his positioning, ability to read the game and his adeptness at winning back possession in one on one situations. Gifted with good technical skills, and excellent distribution, although he is usually deployed as a centre-back, he has also been used as a defensive midfielder, where he has demonstrated his confidence in possession, and ability to play the ball out of defence. Although he is primarily known for his defensive skill and consistency, his pace, stamina and dribbling ability frequently enable him to get forward into good attacking positions, with his trademark long, surging, galloping runs on the ball, which have earned him the nickname \"O Cavalo\" (\"The Horse\", in Portuguese); these attributes, along with his powerful striking ability from distance and on set-pieces with his right foot, make him an additional offensive threat.\n\nLúcio is married to Dione, with whom he has three children: Victoria, João Vítor, and Valentinna. He is an Evangelical Christian, and frequently talks about the way his faith sustains his life in professional football.\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He currently serves as the head coach for Virtus Bologna of the Italian Serie A. During his playing career, he was listed as a 1.88 m (6'2\") 90 kg (198 lb.) point guard. \n\nDuring his pro club playing career, Đorđević, along with his teammate Sasha Danilović, helped to lead Partizan Belgrade to its first EuroLeague title in 1992, while he earned an All-Final Four Team selection in the process. He was twice named the Mister Europa Player of the Year, in both 1994 and 1995. He also played in a total of 108 games, while representing the senior national teams of SFR Yugoslavia, and later FR Yugoslavia. \n\nAs a player, he won gold medals at the 1991 EuroBasket, the 1995 EuroBasket, the 1997 EuroBasket, where he was named the Most Valuable Player, and the 1998 FIBA World Championship. In 1995, Đorđević received the Golden Badge award for the Best Athlete of FR Yugoslavia, and the Yugoslav Olympic Committee declared him the Sportsman of the Year. In 2008, Đorđević was named one of the 50 Greatest EuroLeague Contributors. \n\nĐorđević is most well-known for two famous game-winning shots that he hit during his playing career. He hit the game-winning shot of the 1992 EuroLeague Final, and the game-winning shot of the 1997 EuroBasket game between FR Yugoslavia and Croatia. He is the only person that has won medals at the Summer Olympic Games, the FIBA World Cup, and the FIBA EuroBasket, as both a player and as a head coach.\n\nĐorđević joined Partizan Belgrade during the summer of 1983, at the age of 16. The youngster's arrival at the club coincided with a front office shakeup, that saw Yugoslav and club legend Dragan Kićanović, who had just retired from playing, assume the club's vice-president role. The club also appointed Moka Slavnić, another freshly retired Yugoslav legend, to be the new head coach.\n\nIn summer 1990, after being away from competitive basketball for a year, due to his mandatory Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) service, the then twenty-three-year-old Đorđević spent four months with the Boston Celtics, at their free agent training camp, competing for a spot on the 1990–91 Celtics roster against some thirty other point guards. Đorđević joined the camp on a recommendation from the Celtics' scout Nedjeljko \"Mišo\" Ostarčević, and he made it to the very end of the selection process, before getting cut shortly before the season began, due to Brian Shaw's return to the club from Virtus Roma.\n\nĐorđević's pro club career is most remembered for his game-winning, buzzer-beating three-pointer, in the 1991–92 FIBA European League (EuroLeague)'s 1992 Final, which he hit in the game against the Spanish club Montigalà Joventut. He was named to the 1992 EuroLeague All-Final Four Team. In addition to winning Europe's most prestigious club title, the EuroLeague championship, with Partizan Belgrade in 1992, Đorđević also won Europe's third most important competition at that time, the FIBA Korać Cup title, in the 1988–89 season. He also won two Yugoslav First Federal League championships (1986–87 and 1991–92), and two Yugoslav Cups (1989 and 1992) while with the club.\n\nĐorđević moved from Partizan Belgrade to Olimpia Milano, which competed in the top level Italian League, in 1992. He stayed at the club for two seasons, from 1992–93 to 1993–94. With Olimpia Milano, he won the FIBA Korać Cup championship, which was Europe's third most significant competition at that time, in the 1992–93 season. He was the top scorer of the finals.\n\nĐorđević moved to the Italian League club Fortitudo Bologna, in 1994. He played with the club during the 1994–95 and 1995–96 seasons.\n\nAfter the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Đorđević had a stint with the Portland Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association (NBA), during the 1996–97 season. Đorđević made his NBA debut on November 29, 1996, recording 2 points and a rebound, in a 119–93 win over the Golden State Warriors. His last NBA game was on December 15. Over 8 season games, he averaged 3.1 points per game, in games played in November and December 1996.\n\nAfter his NBA stint with the Portland Trail Blazers in 1996, Đorđević signed with FC Barcelona of Spain's premier competition, the Liga ACB. He stayed with the club for three seasons (1996–97, 1997–98, and 1998–99). With Barcelona, he won the European-wide third-tier level FIBA Korać Cup championship of the 1998–99 season, and he was the final's top scorer. He also won two Spanish ACB League championships with the club, in the 1996–97 and 1998–99 seasons.\n\nIn 1999, Đorđević joined the Spanish ACB League club Real Madrid. With Real Madrid, he won the championship of the 1999–00 Spanish League season. He also spent the 2000–01 and 2001–02 seasons with the club.\n\nAfter a season off, Đorđević returned to Italy and he signed with Scavolini Pesaro for the 2003–04 season. With Scavolini, Djordjevic reached the finals of the 2004 Italian Cup, where his team lost to Benetton Treviso. He also played with Pesaro in the beginning of the 2004–05 season.\n\nOn 25 February 2005, Đorđević signed with Olimpia Milano again. The club made it to the 2004–05 Italian League's Finals, where they lost to Fortitudo Bologna, 3 games to 1. The 2004–05 season was the last season of Đorđević's pro club career.\n\nĐorđević officially retired from playing professional club basketball on 3 July 2005, after an exhibition game, which was held in his honor. The game was held in front of the Serbian fans in Belgrade. Many of his former teammates and toughest opponents played in that game.\n\nĐorđević was a member of SFR Yugoslavia's junior national teams. With the SFR Yugoslav Under-18 national team, he won the gold medal at the 1986 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship. As a member of the SFR Yugoslav Under-19 national team, he won the gold medal at the 1987 FIBA Under-19 World Cup.\n\nĐorđević was also a member of the senior SFR Yugoslav national team. With SFR Yugoslavia, he won a bronze medal at the 1987 EuroBasket. He also won a gold medal at the 1991 EuroBasket.\n\nĐorđević was also a member of the senior FR Yugoslav national team. With FR Yugoslavia, he won the gold medal at the 1995 EuroBasket, where he had one of the best individual performances ever in a EuroBasket Finals game. In that 1995 EuroBasket Finals game against Lithuania, he scored 41 points and made 9 out of his 12 three-point shot attempts. He also won the silver medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics. \n\nĐorđević won another gold medal at the 1997 EuroBasket. During that tournament, he hit a game-winning shot against Croatia. Finally, Đorđević won another gold medal at the 1998 FIBA World Cup.\n\nĐorđević retired from playing pro basketball in 2005. On 25 January 2006, he began a new career, working as a basketball coach, when he was named the head coach of the last team that he played with, Armani Jeans Milano, of Italy's Lega Basket Serie A and Europe's premier competition, the EuroLeague. He left that position at the end of the 2006–07 Italian League season. \n\nĐorđević's next head coaching job was with the Italian Serie A club Benetton Treviso. He coached the club during the 2011–12 season. During that season, the club competed in both the 2011–12 Italian League and also in Europe's secondary competition, the 2011–12 EuroCup. \n\nOn 20 June 2015, Đorđević signed a two-year contract to be the head coach of Panathinaikos, a club competing in the Greek Basket League and the EuroLeague. With Panathinaikos, he won the 2016 edition of the Greek Cup. On 20 April 2016, Panathinaikos announced the termination of Đorđević's contract.\n\nOn 1 August 2016, Đorđević signed a two-year contract with the German Bundesliga team Bayern Munich, to be their head coach. In European-wide competitions, Bayern Munich participated in one of Europe's two secondary competitions, the 2016–17 EuroCup, where it was defeated in the quarterfinals by Unicaja. Bayern Munich finished the 2016–17 Basketball Bundesliga regular season in 3rd place, with 28–4 record, and was eliminated by Brose Bamberg in their semifinal playoff series, with a 3–0 series score. Bayern also finished as the runner-up of the 2017 German Cup for the second season in a row, after losing in the Cup's Final to Brose Bamberg, by a score of 74–71.\n\nOver the summer of 2017, Maik Zirbes, a prominent center, joined the team. Bayern Munich started the 2017–18 German League season in a dominant fashion, leading the league's standings table. In February 2018, Bayern Munich won the 2018 German Cup, after an 80–75 win over Alba Berlin, and the club thus won the German Cup trophy for the first time in 50 years.\n\nOn 29 March 2018, Đorđević was sacked by Bayern, after the club's elimination in the semifinals of the 2017–18 EuroCup. During that season, Bayern Munich held the first position in the 2017–18 Basketball Bundesliga regular season standings, with a record of 23–2, before he was sacked. A few days after his dismissal, Đorđević stated that his firing was an \"insult for common sense\", especially since the 2017–18 season was one of the most successful in the team's history. He also added that there was an apparent disagreement between the team's management (in particular general manager Marko Pešić), and his coaching staff, as he had not allowed the team's management to have a bigger role in coaching decisions.\n\nOn 11 March 2019, Đorđević signed to be the head coach of Virtus Bologna of the Lega Basket Serie A. In his Virtus Bologna debut on 13 March, Đorđević led the team to an 81–58 victory over Le Mans Sarthe. Virtus Bologna advanced to the 2019 Basketball Champions League Final Four in Antwerp, where the club won the championship on the 5th of May, after defeating Iberostar Tenerife, by a score of 73–61, in part thanks to an outstanding game by Kevin Punter, who was named the BCL Final Four MVP. The 2019 BCL championship was the fifth European-wide title in the team's history, and the first one it had won in ten years.\n\nOn 13 July, Virtus signed a three-year deal with Miloš Teodosić, 2016 EuroLeague champion and former NBA player, who was widely considered one of the best European point guard of all time. Among others, the team signed also Vince Hunter, Frank Gaines, Kyle Weems, Julian Gamble, Stefan Marković and Giampaolo Ricci. On 7 April 2020, after more than a month of suspension, the Italian Basketball Federation officially ended the 2019–20 season, due to the coronavirus pandemic that severely hit Italy. Virtus ended the season first, with 18 wins and only 2 defeats, but the title was not assigned.\n\nIn November 2013, Đorđević was named the head coach of the Serbian national basketball team.

He served as SS and Police Leader of the Warsaw area in German-occupied Poland from 1941 until 1943 during World War II. \n\nSammern-Frankenegg was in charge of the Großaktion Warschau, the single most deadly operation against the Jews in the course of the Holocaust in occupied Poland, which entailed sending between 254,000 and 265,000 men, women and children aboard overcrowded Holocaust trains to the extermination camp in Treblinka. The \"liquidation\" of the Warsaw Ghetto between July 23 and September 21, 1942 was disguised as a \"resettlement action\" in order to trick the victims into cooperating. It was a major part of the murderous campaign codenamed Operation Reinhard in the Final Solution. Von Sammern-Frankenegg remained in Warsaw until his first offensive operation in the suppression of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising on April 19, 1943, which was unsuccessful.\n\nAfter the failed offensive, von Sammern-Frankenegg was replaced by Jürgen Stroop, and court-martialed by SS leader Heinrich Himmler on April 24, 1943 for his alleged ineptitude; which, for the SS, meant only one thing: guilty of \"defending Jews\".

Its Middle Persian equivalent, as attested in the Pahlavi script texts of Zoroastrian tradition, is 𐭥𐭤𐭥𐭬𐭭 \"Wahman\", which is a borrowing of the Avestan language expression and has the same meaning, and which continues in New Persian as \"Bahman\" and variants. Manah is cognate with the Sanskrit word Manas suggesting some commonality between the ideas of the Gathas and those of the Rigveda. The opposite of Vohu Manah is Aka Manah, \"evil purpose\" or \"evil mind\".\n\nThe term is a compound of the words \"vohu\" \"good\" and \"manah\" \"mind, thought, purpose\", cognate with the Vedic words \"vásu\" and \"mánas\", both with the same meaning. Both of these derive from Proto-Indo-Iranian \"*Hwásuš\" and \"*mánas\", in turn from Proto-Indo-European \"*h₁wésus\" and \"*ménos\".\n\nIn the Gathas, the oldest texts of the Avesta and considered to be composed by Zoroaster, the term 'Vohu Manah' is not unambiguously used as a proper name and frequently occurs without the \"Good\" (\"Vohu-\") prefix.\n\nIn the post-Gathic texts that expound the principles of Zoroastrian cosmogony, Vohu Manah is an Amesha Spenta, one of seven emanations of Ahura Mazda that each represent one facet of creation. In the case of Vohu Manah, this is all animal creation, with a particular stress on cattle. Vohu Manah is of neutral gender in Avestan grammar but in Zoroastrian tradition is considered masculine.\n\nIn the Zoroastrian calendar, the second day of each month as well as the eleventh month of each year are dedicated to Vohu Manah. In the Iranian civil calendar, which inherits the names of the months from the Zoroastrian calendar, the 11th month is likewise named Bahman.\n\nThe Achaemenid emperor Artaxerxes II (as it is rendered in Greek) had \"Vohu Manah\" as the second part of his throne name, which when \"translated\" into Greek appeared as \"Mnemon\". New Persian \"Bahman\" remains a theophoric in present-day Iranian and Zoroastrian tradition.\n\n\n"}

He led the Buffalo Bandits to 3 of their 4 championships in the Major Indoor Lacrosse League (MILL), and won 4 more championships with the Toronto Rock in the renamed National Lacrosse League (NLL).\n\nBartley became the assistant coach of the Bandits in 1992. When the team started off the 1992 season 0-3, Bandits head coach Buff McCready was fired, and Bartley was given the job of head coach. He then led the team on a 22-game winning streak and MILL championships in 1992 and 1993. The streak included the entire 1993 season, during which the Bandits were 8-0, the only undefeated season in NLL/MILL history. The streak came to an end on February 19, 1994.\n\nBartley's only losing season as a professional lacrosse coach came in the 1995 season after going 3-5. In 1996, he coached the Bandits to their third championship in the MILL. After the 1997 season, Les left the Bandits after leading them to a 36-13 record in six seasons.\n\nWhen the MILL became the NLL in 1998, the league added its first Canadian franchise: the Ontario Raiders, who played in Copps Coliseum in Hamilton, Ontario. Bartley, a native of nearby St. Catharines, Ontario, helped get the new franchise off the ground. In 1999, the Ontario Raiders moved to Toronto and became the Toronto Rock. Les coached the Rock to four championships in five years.\n\nIn November 2003, Les gave up his role of Coach and General Manager of the Rock to fight colon cancer, though he maintained the title of Vice-President of the Rock. Prior to the 2005 season, Bartley, who worked as a General Motors union representative until retiring in 2004, lent his labour negotiation expertise to the league, helping to reach a collective bargaining agreement with the NLL players' association. On May 9, 2005, Bartley was named by the NLL as its Executive of the Year.\n\nLess than a week later, on May 15, 2005, Les Bartley died at his home in St. Catharines after his 18-month battle with cancer. Bartley was 51. He died 18 hours after the Toronto Rock won their 5th NLL Championship.\n\nBartley led the Rock to a 51-19 record in five seasons in the NLL, and 9-1 in the post-season. His overall record of 93-38 (.709) in the regular season is second all-time. Only current Buffalo Bandits coach Darris Kilgour has more. His 18-4 (.818) record in the playoffs is the most wins of any coach in NLL history.\n\nIn recognition of Bartley's contribution to the NLL and his success as a coach, the NLL renamed the annual Coach of the Year award as the \"Les Bartley Award\". Fittingly, two of the first recipients of the renamed award were Derek Keenan of the Portland Lumberjax in 2006 and Ed Comeau of the Rochester Knighthawks in 2007, both former assistants of Bartley in Toronto.\n\nIn June 2005, the National Lacrosse League announced that Bartley would be a Charter member of the National Lacrosse League Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame at the 2006 NLL All-Star Game in Toronto.\n\nIn March 2007, the Toronto Rock announced a new award in honour of Bartley. The Les Bartley Award (not to be confused with the \"Les Bartley Award\" given by the league) will be \"given annually to the Rock player that best exemplifies Les' emphasis on the importance of character and commitment to the team\".\n\n"}

The concept is feudal in origin, and common in countries which rely on the English legal system (including many former British colonies). The word is derived from the root word demesne.\n\nMesne profits commonly occur where a landlord has obtained an order from a court to evict a tenant, or where an individual sues to eject a \"bona fide\" landowner to whom title to land was improperly conveyed. The mesne profit represents the value (living rent-free, profits earned from the land, etc.) the ejected tenant received from the property between the time the court ordered the eviction and the time when the tenant actually left the property. Mesne profits must be drawn from the land itself, rather than improvements on it. For example, mesne profits may accrue from growing crops on land but would not generally accrue from a factory built on the land (unless there were damage to the land or improvements to the land itself such as the removal of stone from a field).\n\nA statute of limitations (usually six years) often limits the tenant-in-error's liability.\n\nCalculating mesne profits is often regulated by legislatures, but may be litigated in a court of equity. Mesne profits may be calculated, even though there may be no point in doing so (as in the case where land was flooded by a dam, and the dam is not going to be removed). In the United States, laws regulating mesne profits have been the subject of Supreme Court decisions, such as \"Green v. Biddle\", 21 U.S. 1 (1823).\n\n"}

In 1848 Pfäffikon lost its independent status and was subsequently merged into Freienbach. With important administrative and educational centers as well as one of the two fire departments of the canton in town, Pfäffikon became the second, northern center of the canton, especially since the canton's capital, Schwyz, across in the foothills of the Alps is relatively difficult to reach (via Biberbrugg-Rothenthurm). This resulted in Pfäffikon orienting itself more towards Zürich than Schwyz, causing political tensions.

It opened in the beginning of the 2005-06 school year for incoming freshmen and sophomores only. As the years went on and classes progressed into the upper classes of juniors and seniors, additional classes were added in their place with the school becoming a full-fledged four year high school in the 2007-2008 academic year.

Estes was a non-tenured teacher who passed all background checks when he was hired. He later resigned from his teaching post.\n\nOn November 19, 2016 Plainfield North was awarded a controversial victory over Fenwick High School in the 7A state semifinal in overtime. “On the final play of the fourth quarter in today’s IHSA Class 7A Semifinal Football game between Fenwick High School and Plainfield North High School, an error was made by the officiating crew, which resulted in an untimed down being awarded to Plainfield North. On the untimed down, Plainfield North tied the contest with a field goal and then went on to win the game in overtime. Per Rule 3-3-4 in the 2016 NFHS Football Rules Book, the game should have concluded on the final play of regulation and the untimed down should not have been awarded. The IHSA issued an apology to Fenwick, as the rules clearly state that Plainfield should not have received an untimed down, but it could not overturn the game. Fenwick sued the IHSA seeking immediate injunctive relief for the right to go to the State Championship game. Judge Kathleen Kennedy listened to the arguments of both Fenwick and the IHSA and after deliberating ruled in favor of the IHSA.\n\n"}
{"id": "1896579", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896579", "title": "Winter's Tale (novel)", "text": "Winter's Tale (novel)\n\nWinter's Tale is a 1983 fantasy novel by Mark Helprin. It takes place in a mythic New York City, markedly different from reality, and in an industrial Edwardian era near the turn of the 20th century. The novel was adapted into a feature film by Akiva Goldsman.\n\nPeter Lake is the central character of \"Winter's Tale\". A child of an immigrant couple denied admission at Ellis Island, Peter Lake is set adrift in New York Harbor in a miniature model ship called \"City of Justice\". He is found in the reeds and adopted by the Baymen of the Bayonne Marsh, who send him off to Manhattan when he comes of age. There he first becomes a mechanic and then is forced to become a burglar in a gang called the Short Tails. He soon makes a mortal enemy of their leader, Pearly Soames, and is constantly on the run from the gang. Early one winter morning Peter is on the brink of being captured and killed by the gang when he is rescued by a mysterious white horse, who becomes his guardian.\n\nWhile attempting to rob a house, Peter Lake meets and falls in love with Beverly Penn. The daughter of millionaire Isaac Penn, owner and publisher of \"The Sun,\" one of New York's greatest newspapers, Beverly is eccentric, free-spirited, and enigmatic. This captivates Peter initially, but deeper nature is revealed with her impending fatal illness from consumption. Beverly never disappears from Peter's life, protecting him until the very end. His love for the dying Beverly causes him to become obsessed with justice.\n\nIn yet another escape from Pearly's men, both Peter Lake and the white horse crash into a mysterious, recurring cloud wall, disappearing in it for decades. When Peter Lake emerges, he no longer remembers who he is and is visibly no longer of this world, seeing and hearing things that nobody else can see or hear. One night, in a dream or a vision, he is carried on a tour of all the graves of the world, observing and remembering all the dead. In the apocalyptic chaos of burning New York, he acquires astonishing powers.\n\nPeter Lake refers to himself, earlier in his life, as \"Grand Central Pete\". In reality, there was a well-known confidence man in the late 19th century known by this name.\n\nAthansor, the white horse, acts as a guardian angel of Peter Lake. Able to fly and possessing extraordinary endurance, the white horse appears to be an angelic being. Before the end, Peter Lake releases him to finally let him go to heaven, as Athansor had not been able to do before because of Peter Lake.\n\nThe white horse appears on the first pages of the book, saving Peter Lake who is being pursued by the Short Tails. The name of the horse is unknown to Peter Lake, but when Peter Lake visits Bayonne Marsh, the Baymen recognise the horse as Athansor, part of their oral lore. The Baymen arrive from everywhere to view the horse, but never explain what they know about him besides the name and the fact that he comes from the left.\n\nAthansor is separated from Peter Lake when they both crash into the cloud wall but gets reunited with him towards the end of the story. Peter Lake releases him, and Athansor heads towards the heavenly pastures. As he gallops across Manhattan, trying to lift off, the whole island shakes under his hoofbeats.\n\nBeverly Penn is a young woman dying from consumption who meets Peter Lake when he breaks into her house. Beverly is a visionary who can feel the universe. She writes down equations that explain the universe and mean for her that the universe shouts and growls. Beverly's father, newspaper publisher Isaac Penn, says about her that she had seen the Golden Age.\n\nEven after her death, Beverly protects Peter Lake. Pearly Soames says that he tried but could not get to Peter Lake through Beverly's protection.\n\nA master bridge builder and an enigmatic figure, Jackson Mead constructed many fine bridges all around the country. He is a brilliant engineer and appears to have unlimited material resources for the job. He is eventually revealed to be an exile from heaven, whose purpose is to build one last bridge that will bring forth the end of the world as it is, letting him return to heaven. As Jackson Mead puts it, his purpose is \"to tag this world with wider and wider rainbows, until the last is so perfect and eternal that it will catch the eye of the One who has abandoned us, and bring Him to right all the broken symmetries and make life once again a still and timeless dream. My purpose, Mr. Marratta, is to stop time, to bring back the dead. My purpose, in one word, is justice.\" Jackson Mead's rainbow bridge does not take, but he is not upset by the failure and disappears to bide time until his next attempt.\n\nIt is interesting that Jackson Mead's stated goal \"to stop time and bring back the dead\", in precisely these words, is widely associated with Peter Lake and in particular attributed to him on the back of the paperback edition.\n\nJackson Mead's character is partially based on Joseph Strauss, the engineer of the Golden Gate Bridge. Hardesty Marratta recognizes Jackson Mead's face in the face of the monument to Joseph Strauss at the Golden Gate. The inscription on the monument refers to the bridge as the \"eternal rainbow\", a simile used by Jackson Mead.\n\nHowever, despite being a main character in the novel, he does not make an appearance in the movie.\n\nLake of the Coheeries is a semi-mythical lake and village, playing the role of Faerie, Elfland, or Alfheim. Lake of the Coheeries is fictional, supposedly located in upstate New York across a mountain range from the Hudson River Valley. Virginia Gamely is a resident there, living with her mother, Mrs. Gamely. Both women ultimately play roles in New York City at the end of the tale. Virginia's daughter is resurrected by Peter Lake.\n\n\"Winter's Tale\" was published in 1983. It was praised on the front cover of the \"New York Times Book Review\" (NYTBR) as \"funny, thoughtful, passionate...large-souled.\" \nReviewing the novel in \"Interzone\" magazine, Mary Gentle described \"Winter's Tale\" as\n\"a faerie family saga\" and \"the first specifically \"capitalist\" fantasy\".\nDavid Pringle, in the book \"\", praised \"Winter's Tale\" as \"a haunting piece of North American\nmagic realism\".\nIn May 2006, the \"New York Times Book Review\" published a list of American novels, compiled from the responses to \"a short letter [from the review] to a couple of hundred prominent writers, critics, editors and other literary sages, asking them to identify 'the single best work of American fiction published in the last 25 years.'\" Among the 22 books to have received multiple votes was Helprin's \"Winter's Tale\".\n\nThe film adaptation was released on Valentine's Day, 2014 and starred Colin Farrell as Peter Lake, Russell Crowe as Pearly Soames, Jessica Brown Findlay as Beverly Penn, Jennifer Connelly as Virginia Gamely, and Will Smith as Lucifer though originally credited as \"Judge\".\n\nThe movie began filming in New York in October 2012 with a slight delay due to Hurricane Sandy. Shooting on the film ran through early 2013 and operated on a $60 million budget, down from the original $75 million budget. It is unknown when Helprin sold the movie rights, with one report of Martin Scorsese originally purchasing the rights.\n\nAkiva Goldsman wrote the screenplay adaptation for the movie and is also making this his directing debut. Warner Bros. Pictures approved the picture in February 2011. The cinematographer is Caleb Deschanel; composer Hans Zimmer wrote the score.\n\nCharacters not appearing in the film include Jackson Mead, Virginia's son Martin, and both Vittorio and Hardesty Marratta.\n"}

The association was dissolved with \"immediate effect\", according to Minister of Sport, Isaac Kwame Asiamah, on 7 June 2018, after the uncovering of a corruption scandal. In October 2019, a new president Kurt Okraku was elected and the association reconvened upon the completion of the work of the FIFA Normalization Committee.Mr Mark Addo was elected vice president in November 2019.\n\nThe Ghana Football Association (GFA) is the successor to the Gold Coast Football Association, which used to be the governing body for football in Ghana and was one of the oldest football associations in Africa, having been founded in 1920. Records indicate that Cape Coast and Accra were the first colonial cities in sub-Saharan Africa to host formal leagues in the Gold Coast. After a weak start in 1915, the league kicked off in 1922 with the Accra Hearts of Oak Sporting Club emerging as winners, taking the coveted Guggisberg shield – named after the progressive British governor of that period and the man who started the Accra Football League, Sir Gordon Guggisberg.\n\nFootball was brought to the Gold Coast near the end of the 19th century by merchants from Europe, who had by then conquered the coastal areas and built forts and castles to facilitate trade. In their leisure time, the sailors would play football among themselves and with the indigenous people.\n\nThe popularity of the game spread quickly along the coast, culminating in the formation of the first football club, Excelsior, in 1903 by Mr. Briton, a Jamaican-born British citizen who was the then Head Teacher of Philip Quaque Government Boys School in Cape Coast. As the popularity of the game grew, other amateur clubs were formed along the coast, including: Accra Hearts of Oak, Accra Standfast, Cape Coast Venomous Vipers, Cape Coast Mysterious Dwarfs, Sekondi Hasaacas, and Sekondi Eleven Wise.\n\nIn 1952, the Government of the Gold Coast enacted Ordinance 14, which established the Gold Coast Amateur Sports Council, and granted the Government of the Gold Coast the legal authority to control all amateur Associations, including Football.\n\nAs the popularity of the game spread throughout the country, the existing clubs met towards the end of 1930 and elected Richard Maabuo Akwei as their Chairman.\n\nTowards the middle of 1950, the clubs, spearheaded by Ohene Djan, accused Akwei of maladministration and questioned his ability to help grow Ghanaian Football. They therefore addressed petitions to the Governor of the Gold Coast, Sir Charles Arden-Clarke, and the Pioneer Sports Organizer, Joseph Ranadurai, on the maladministration of the Amateur Football Association by Akwei. While the petition was being addressed, Ohene Djan led a “Football Revolution\" and succeeded in toppling the Akwei Administration in 1957.\n\nIn 1957, Ohene Djan was elected General Secretary of the Football Association by the clubs and the Ghana Amateur Football Association was officially founded. He strategically affiliated the Association with FIFA in 1958 and the CAF in 1960.\n\nDjan was instrumental in securing sponsorship for the first Ghanaian FA cup competition from a pharmaceutical firm, Merrs R.R. Harding and Company. In the same year he succeeded in securing the services of an expatriate Coach, George Ainsley, for the National Team. Then in 1959, he succeeded again in organizing the first national league, before Ghana became a republic on 1 July 1960.\n\nThrough the 1993 Winneba Declaration, Ghanaian football was able to shrug off its amateur status. The formation of professional teams allowed clubs to be incorporated under the companies code (Act 179, 1963) as Limited Liability Companies.\n\nThe Association was dissolved 'with immediate effect' on 7 June 2018, after undercover journalist Anas Aremeyaw Anas revealed the amount of corruption in the association and Ghanaian football in general. Referees and officials of the association were filmed taking bribes. \nThe Sports Minister Isaac Kwame Asiamah referred to Kwesi Nyantakyi on Accra-based JoyFM as \"former president\" because all arms and affiliates of the GFA stand dissolved. The GFA is set to reopen in August 2019.\n\nElections were held in October 2019 and out of the six candidates who contested, Kurt Okraku emerged the winner. In November 2019, the Women's Leaugue Committee was put together. The team was made up of Hilary Boateng (Chairperson), Rosalind Amoh (Vice chairperson), Nana Aba Anamoah, Cleopatra Nsia, Jerry Dogbatse, Nana Poku Fosu Geabour II and Christian Isaac Mensah. In January 2020, Prosper Harrison Addo was appointed the General Secretary. It was announced in early January that the technical crew of all the national teams had been disbanded. This was done with the intention of giving the sport a fresh start and enhancing the performance of the teams. Pursuant to the disbanding, Mercy Efua Tagoe-Quarcoo and Charles Kwabla Akonnor were appointed head coaches of the Black Queens and Black Stars respectively. Mercy Tagoe-Quarcoo was assisted by Charles Anokye Frimpong and Charles Akonnor by David Duncan. The National Teams Department was added to the outfit of GFA and Mr Alex Asante who is a Deputy General Secretary was appointed as its acting head. \n\nThe Ghana Amateur Football Association was affiliated with CAF in 1960, and in 1963 won the bid to host the 5th Africa Cup of Nations, to coincide with the Meeting of the (OAU) Heads of States and Government in Accra. Ghana won the trophy and went ahead again to successfully defend it in Tunisia in 1965.\n\nAfter the 1965 triumph, Ghana hosted and won the 13th Africa Cup of Nations in 1978, and four years later, won it again in Tripoli, Libya. The team have won the Africa Cup of Nations four times (in 1963, 1965, 1978, and 1982), making Ghana the second most successful team in the contest's history, along with Cameroon.\n\nAlthough the team did not qualify for the senior FIFA World Cup until 2006, Ghana has enjoyed tremendous success at the youth level, winning the FIFA World Under-17 title twice and finishing runner-up twice. Ghana has also finished second at the FIFA World Youth Championship twice.\n\nGhana became the first African country to win a medal in Football at the 1992 Summer Olympics.\n\nIn 2009, Ghana became the first African country to win the U-20 FIFA World cup by defeating Brazil.\n\nWith regard to women's football, the Ghana Black Queens have participated in two World Cup tournaments and the Olympic Games. They have also been runners-up to the Falcons of Nigeria in the Africa Cup of Nations series.\n\nGhana last hosted the African Cup of Nations Tournament in January 2008.\n\nGhana qualified for the African Cup of Nations Tournament in January 2017 after finishing top of Group H in the qualifying stages.\n\n\nAn undercover investigation led by \"The Telegraph\" and Channel 4 accused Kwesi Nyantaky and other officials of the Ghana Federation of match-fixing. According to this information, the accusations involve just the international friendlies – thus, the World Cup matches wouldn't be affected by the suspicions. Kwesi Nyantakyi denied the match fixing allegations, saying: \"the report of the newspaper or the media house is entirely not accurate.\" and \"There is really no cause for alarm as far as I am concerned, because nothing untoward has happened involving me or the Federation\".\n\n"}

An attempt by the Union Army to capture Fort Wagner was repulsed. The more famous Second Battle of Fort Wagner, which involved an assault by the 54th Massachusetts, would be fought on July 18.\n\nIn early June 1863, Union Brig. Gen. Quincy A. Gillmore replaced Maj. Gen. David Hunter as commander of the Department of the South. Gillmore, an Army engineer, had successfully captured Fort Pulaski in April 1862. He began preparations for capturing Morris Island and parts of James Island, which dominated the southern approaches to Charleston Harbor. If Union artillery could be placed in those locations, they could assist in the bombardment of Fort Sumter, whose guns prevented the U.S. Navy from entering the harbor.\n\nOn July 10, Union artillery on Folly Island (which had been occupied in April 1863) and naval gunfire from Rear Admiral John A. Dahlgren's four ironclad warships bombarded the Confederate defenses protecting the southern end of Morris Island. This provided cover for the landing of Brig. Gen. George C. Strong's brigade, which crossed Lighthouse Inlet and landed at the southern tip of the island. Strong's troops advanced, capturing several batteries, moving about three miles to within range of Fort Wagner. Also known as Battery Wagner, it was a heavily gunned redoubt that covered nearly the entire width of the northern end of Morris Island, facing Sumter. Strong's report described the advance:\n\nOn July 11, Strong's brigade attacked at dawn, advancing through a thick fog, attempting to seize Fort Wagner. Although the men of the 7th Connecticut Infantry overran a line of rifle pits, they were repulsed by the 1,770-man force under Confederate Col. Robert F. Graham. Heavy artillery fire from Fort Wagner prevented other units from joining the attack.\n\nUnion casualties were 339 (49 killed, 123 wounded, 167 missing), Confederate 12. The First Battle of Fort Wagner was followed on July 16 by assaults on James Island and on July 18 by the famous, but also unsuccessful, charge of the 54th Massachusetts Infantry on July 18 in the Second Battle of Fort Wagner.\n\nIn May 2008, TPL and partners, including the South Carolina Conservation Bank, the South Carolina State Ports Authority, the Civil War Trust, (a division of the American Battlefield Trust) and many private donors, purchased the island on behalf of the City of Charleston from Ginn Resorts for $3 million. Previously, in 2003, when a builder announced his plans to build houses on the tract, for which he had an option to buy, the Trust, local preservationist Blake Hallman and others formed the Morris Island Coalition, generated media attention and support for preservation and defeated the effort. Ginn Resorts was interested in developing the property, too, but ultimately decided to purchase it and then immediately sell it to the preservationists. According to TPL, the city and county are working \"to complete a management plan to protect the island's nationally significant historical and natural resources.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1896591", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896591", "title": "Second Battle of Fort Wagner", "text": "Second Battle of Fort Wagner\n\nThe Second Battle of Fort Wagner, also known as the Second Assault on Morris Island or the Battle of Fort Wagner, Morris Island, was fought on July 18, 1863, during the American Civil War. Union Army troops commanded by Brig. Gen. Quincy Gillmore, launched an unsuccessful assault on the Confederate fortress of Fort Wagner, which protected Morris Island, south of Charleston Harbor. The battle came one week after the First Battle of Fort Wagner.\n\nFort Wagner, or Battery Wagner as it was known to the Confederates, controlled the southern approaches to Charleston Harbor. It was commanded by Brigadier General William B. Taliaferro. An attempt was made on July 11 to assault the fort, the First Battle of Fort Wagner, but it was repulsed with heavy losses to the attackers because of artillery and musket fire. Brig. Gen. Quincy Gillmore intended to repeat his assault, but first executed feints to distract the Confederates' attention, the Battle of Grimball's Landing on July 18, 1863. Gillmore also ordered an artillery bombardment of the fort. The fort was on a very narrow island so the Union could only assault the fort with one regiment at a time.\n\nThe approach to the fort was constricted to a strip of beach 60 yards (55 m) wide with the ocean to the east and the marsh from Vincent's (now Bass) Creek to the west. Upon rounding this defile, the Union Army was presented with the 250-yard south face of Fort Wagner, which stretched from Vincent's creek to the sea. Surrounding the fort was a shallow moat riveted with sharpened palmetto logs, as abatis, and the moat on the seaward side had planks with spikes positioned beneath the water. The armament of Fort Wagner on the night of July 18 consisted of one 10-inch seacoast mortar, two 32 lb. carronades, two 8-inch shell guns, two 32 lb. howitzers, a 42 lb. carronade, and an 8-inch seacoast mortar on the land face. Company A of the 1st South Carolina Artillery also had two guns positioned outside of Wagner's southern face by Vincent's creek to provide enfilading fire. The sea face of Wagner was armed with one 32 lb. carronade, one 10-inch Columbiad, and two 12 lb. howitzers. The garrison of Battery Wagner consisted of the 1st South Carolina Artillery, the Charleston Battalion, the 31st North Carolina, and the 51st North Carolina.\n\nGilmore ordered his siege guns and mortars to begin a bombardment of the fort on July 18 and they were joined by the naval gunfire from six monitors that pulled to within 300 yards of the fort. The bombardment lasted eight hours, but caused little damage against the sandy walls of the fort, and in all, killed only about 8 men and wounded an additional 20, as the defenders had taken cover in the bombproof shelter.\n\nThe 54th Massachusetts, an infantry regiment composed of African-American soldiers led by Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, led the Union attack at dusk. They were backed by two brigades composed of nine regiments. The first brigade was commanded by Gen. George Crockett Strong and was composed of the 54th Massachusetts, 6th Connecticut, 48th New York, 3rd New Hampshire, 76th Pennsylvania, and the 9th Maine regiments. The second brigade was commanded by Col. Haldimand S. Putnam of the 7th New Hampshire as acting brigade commander. His brigade consisted of the 7th New Hampshire, 62nd Ohio, 67th Ohio, and the 100th New York regiments. A third brigade under Gen. Stevenson was in reserve, with General Truman Seymour commanding on the field, but did not enter action.\n\nThe assault began at 7:45 p.m. and was conducted in three movements. The 54th Massachusetts attacked to the west upon the curtain of Wagner, with the remainder of Gen. Strong's brigade and Col. Putnam's brigade attacking the seaward salient on the south face. As the assault commenced and bombardment subsided, the men of the 1st South Carolina Artillery, Charleston Battalion, and 51st North Carolina Infantry took their positions. The 31st North Carolina, which had been completely captured during the battle of Roanoke Island and later exchanged, remained in the bombproof shelter and did not take its position in the southeast bastion. When the 54th Massachusetts reached about 150 yards from the fort, the defenders opened up with cannon and small arms, tearing through their ranks. The 51st North Carolina delivered a direct fire into them, as the Charleston Battalion fired into their left. The 54th managed to reach the parapet, but after a fierce struggle, including hand-to-hand combat, they were forced back. The 6th Connecticut continued the assault at the weakest point, the southeast, where the 31st had failed to take its position. General Taliaferro quickly rounded up some soldiers to take the position, while the 51st North Carolina and Charleston Battalion fired obliquely into the assailants. Behind the 6th Connecticut, the 48th New York also successfully reached the slopes of the bastion. The remainder of Strong's brigade did not reach that far, as three of the defending howitzers were now in action and firing canister into their flanks, bringing them to a halt. Colonel Putnam quickly brought up his brigade, but only about 100 or 200 men from the 62nd and 67th Ohio reached the bastion. The Confederates attempted to counter-attack twice, but were beaten back after having the officers leading the charge shot down. As the Union assault continued to crumble, due to lack of reinforcements from General Stevenson, Taliaferro was reinforced by the 32nd Georgia Infantry, which had been transported to the island by Brigadier General Johnson Hagood. The fresh troops swept over the bastion, killing and capturing the rest of the Union troops that remained.\n\nBy 10 p.m. the bloody struggle had concluded with heavy losses. Gen. George Crockett Strong was mortally wounded in the thigh by grape shot while trying to rally his men. Col. Haldimand S. Putnam was shot in the head and killed in the salient while giving the order to withdraw. Col. John Lyman Chatfield of the 6th Connecticut was mortally wounded. The 54th Massachusetts's colonel, Robert Gould Shaw, was killed upon the parapet early in the action. Some Confederate reports claim his body was pierced seven times, with the fatal wound a rifle bullet to his chest. Also, another of the 54th’s casualties was Lewis Douglass, son of the famous orator Frederick Douglass.\n\nIn all, about 1,515 Union soldiers were killed, captured, or wounded in the assault of July 18, although this number has never been accurately ascertained. Gen. Hagood, the commander of Fort Wagner on the morning of July 19, stated in his report to Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard that he buried 800 bodies in mass graves in front of Wagner. Only 315 men were left from the 54th after the battle. Thirty were killed in action, including Col. Shaw and Captains Russel and Simpkins, and buried together in a single grave. Twenty-four later died of wounds, fifteen were captured, and fifty-two were reported missing after the battle and never seen again. The men of the 54th Massachusetts were hailed for their valor. William Carney, an African-American sergeant with the 54th, is considered the first black recipient of the Medal of Honor for his actions that day in recovering and returning the unit's U.S. Flag to Union lines. Their conduct improved the reputation of African Americans as soldiers, leading to greater Union recruitment of African-Americans, which strengthened the Northern states' numerical advantage. In addition, the South recognized for the first time that captured African American soldiers were to be treated as enemy combatants and not criminals. Confederate casualties numbered 174.\n\nThe fort was reinforced by Brig. Gen. Johnson Hagood's brigade shortly after the assault had ended. The garrison of Fort Wagner was then changed during the night, and Gen. Hagood assumed command. He was relieved by Col. Laurence M. Keitt, who commanded the fort until it was abandoned on September 7. Gen Hagood wrote a book titled Memoirs of the War of Secession, in which he states that the constant bombardment from the Union guns had unearthed such large numbers of the Union dead buried after the assault of July 18, and the air was so sickening with the smell of death, that one could no longer stand to be in the fort. The constant bombardment caused Confederate soldiers who were killed during the siege to be buried in the walls of Wagner, and they were also constantly being unearthed. Following the Union repulse, engineers besieged the fort. The Confederates abandoned the fort on September 7, 1863, after resisting 60 days of shelling, it having been deemed untenable because of the damage from constant bombardment, lack of provisions, and the close proximity of the Union siege trenches to Wagner.\n\n\nIn May 2008, the Trust for Public Land (TPL) and partners, including the South Carolina Conservation Bank, the South Carolina State Ports Authority, the Civil War Trust, (a division of the American Battlefield Trust) and many private donors, purchased the island on behalf of the City of Charleston from Ginn Resorts for $3 million. Previously, in 2003, when a builder announced his plans to build houses on the tract, for which he had an option to buy, the Trust, local preservationist Blake Hallman and others formed the Morris Island Coalition, generated media attention and support for preservation and defeated the effort.

According to TPL, the city and county are working \"to complete a management plan to protect the island's nationally significant historical and natural resources\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1896611", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896611", "title": "Cool Britannia", "text": "Cool Britannia\n\nCool Britannia was a period of increased pride in the culture of the United Kingdom throughout most of the 1990s, inspired by 1960s pop culture. The success of Britpop and musical acts such as the Spice Girls, Blur and Oasis led to a renewed feeling of optimism in the United Kingdom following the tumultuous years of the 1970s and 1980s. The name is a pun on the title of the British patriotic song \"Rule, Britannia!\"\n\nThe phrase \"Cool Britannia\" was first used in 1967 as a song title by the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band (specifically, the first song in the debut album \"Gorilla\" and contained the lyric, “Cool Britannia, Britannia you are cool/Take a trip!/Britons ever, ever, ever shall be hip.” The song thereby directly references the lyrics of \"Rule Britannia\". The phrase \"Cool Britannia\" reappeared in early 1996 as a registered trade mark for one of Ben & Jerry's ice-creams – which mixed vanilla, strawberries and “fudge-covered shortbread”, and as used by the media and in advertising, it seemed to capture the cultural renaissance of London at the time (as celebrated in a 1996 \"Newsweek\" magazine cover headlined \"London Rules\"). The election of Tony Blair's Labour government in 1997, seen by some as young, cool and very appealing, was a main driving force in giving Britain a feeling of euphoria and optimism.\n\nThe use of this term was similar to that of \"Swinging London\" for the boom in art, fashion and popular music during the early years of Harold Wilson's Labour government. Such a parallel was apt as, like Blair, Wilson was considered a relatively young Prime Minister, his administration ended an extended period of Conservative governments (tarnished in the latter period by scandal), and his early tenure coincided with a period of economic prosperity. Many of the creative industries labelled as Cool Britannia were avowedly inspired by the music, fashion and art of the 1960s.\n\n\"Time\" described \"Cool Britannia\" as the mid-1990s celebration of youth culture in the UK. To the extent that it had any real meaning, \"Cool Britannia\" referred to the transient fashionable London house scene: clubs included the Ministry of Sound and the underground Megatripolis at Heaven, 1990s bands such as Blur and Oasis, fashion designers, the Young British Artists and magazines. Cool Britannia also summed up the mood in Britain during the mid-1990s Britpop movement, when there was a resurgence of distinctive British rock and pop music from groups such as Oasis, Blur, Pulp, Suede, Supergrass, and Elastica, as well as the Spice Girls. .\n\nThe renewal in British pride (reinforced by the strong and uninterrupted growth of the British economy from 1993), was symbolised in imagery such as Noel Gallagher's Union Jack guitar and Geri Halliwell's skimpy Union Jack dress, worn at the 1997 Brit Awards. The Euro 96 football tournament, hosted in England, is also considered an event that encouraged a resurgence of patriotism, particularly in England. John Major, who was prime minister at the time, famously took credit (November 1996), accompanied with a press release issued by the Department of National Heritage: “Our fashion, music and culture are the envy of our European neighbours. This abundance of talent, together with our rich heritage, makes ‘Cool Britannia’ an obvious choice for visitors from all over the world.” With his high profile bouts world featherweight champion boxer ”Prince” Naseem Hamed is also associated with the era, as are alcopops and Lads' Magazines.\n\nReleased in 1994, \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\" (1994), featuring one of the era's biggest stars, Hugh Grant, had been an early portent of the new wave of British cinema. Devised by screenwriter Richard Curtis, it set a pattern for British-set romantic comedies, including \"Sliding Doors\" (1998) and \"Notting Hill\" (1999), the latter also starring Grant. The first Austin Powers film, \"\", co-starring Elizabeth Hurley (who was in a high profile relationship with Grant), was released in 1997, and with its Cool Britannia influenced take on the Swinging London era it instantly included itself in the same 1990s cultural moment. Danny Boyle’s 1996 film \"Trainspotting\" featured a Britpop-heavy soundtrack.\n\nIn March 1997 \"Vanity Fair\" published a special edition on Cool Britannia with Liam Gallagher and Patsy Kensit on the cover; the title read 'London Swings! Again!'. Figures in the issues included Alexander McQueen, Damien Hirst, Graham Coxon and the editorial staff of \"Loaded\". Tony Blair’s speech at the 1996 Labour party conference drew on the optimism of the Euro 96 football championships – accompanied with the summer’s chart-topping anthem “Three Lions”. Alluding to the “thirty years of hurt” lyric in the song (since England last won the World Cup), Blair stated, “Seventeen years of hurt never stopped us dreaming. Labour’s coming home.” After the Labour party won its landslide in 1997, there was even more enthusiasm. By 1998 \"The Economist\" was commenting that \"many people are already sick of the phrase\", and senior Labour politicians, such as Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, seemed embarrassed by its usage. By 2000 (after the decline of Britpop as a tangible genre) it was being used mainly in a mocking or ironic way. \n\nTwo highlight DVDs, \"Later... With Jools Holland: Cool Britannia\" 1 & 2, have appeared since 2004. Similar terms have been used regionally for similar phenomena; in Wales and Scotland, \"Cool Cymru\" and \"Cool Caledonia\", respectively, have been used.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1896624", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896624", "title": "Peebles High School, Peeblesshire", "text": "Peebles High School, Peeblesshire\n\nPeebles High School is a state run comprehensive school for girls and boys aged 12–18, located in Peebles in the Scottish Borders. It was originally named Bonnington Park Academy in 1858. Since then, it has expanded and is now attended by 1,500 pupils from all over the Tweeddale area.\n\nThe school was expanded In 2000 when The Millennium Wing was added. This expansion meant a great increase in size and capacity including a Learning Resource Centre and entire business suite. A new sports centre was completed in 2014.\n\nIn 2013, the school was ranked 28th in Scotland for Higher exam passes.\n\nThe school was damaged severely by a serious fire on the 28th of November 2019, which forced its closure for several weeks.\n\nThe school follows the standard Scottish curriculum with subjects ranging from Mathematics and English to newer subjects such as Business Management and Child Care.\n\nRugby and Hockey are popular sports at the school. However, students are encouraged to participate in a wide range of other sports including football, netball, mountain biking, swimming and athletics.\n\nThe very first origins of Peebles High School date as far back as 1464 when a “scule and sculmaster” were appointed. Two centuries later there is evidence of “the establishment of the English School and the Grammar School of Peebles on Tweed Green”. More recent history suggests the most immediate origins of Peebles High School was in 1858 when a private school, known then as Bonnington Park Academy for boys, was established. A private school for girls called St Leonards existed around that time and was hosted within the Parish Church Manse.\n\nBy 1873 the roll of children in the local community totalled 538 between the ages of 5-13, 85% of whom were at school. To accommodate this increasing roll, an application was made to make the existing school a “Higher Class School” i.e. to teach beyond elementary level. In 1876 it was only one of 20 in Scotland to achieve this. Also in this year “young ladies” were finally allowed to enrol. This led to a change of name to” Peebles High School-Bonnington Park.” Students came from all over the county. It was, however, a private school that consisted of a preparatory and upper school, the latter requiring an examination to permit a pupil to access.\n\nIn 1901 there were about 100 students in the “upper part of the school” now known as “Peebles and County High school”. The Education Act of 1908 finally allowed grants to children allowing them to remain in school. By 1910 the school was a single story building consisting of a number of rooms off of a single corridor, where the science labs now exist.\n\nBy 1927 there were approximately 200 pupils in the school and 12 staff, however by 1935 the Preparation department was closed and pupils transferred to Kingsland and Halyrude. Lack of accommodation beyond the age of 14 at these schools meant that a decision was made to expand the Burgh and County School in 1936. The new addition to the school known as the “36 block” was completed in 1938, This now meant all pupils over the age of 12 were expected to attend. There were extensive sports fields around the school, allowing a wide access to sport.\n\nThe beginning of World War Two saw a large influx of evacuees to “safe” Peebles, adding six air raid shelters to the school playground and a necessity to turn playing fields into vegetable allotments. The Education Act of 1947 saw the roll increase to 400, as students were now to remain at school until age 15. At this time there was also an increase of students remaining into the 6th year.\n\nThe next significant structural change, due to the pressure on accommodation and the leaving age increasing to age 16, was the “Tower, dining room and technical block”. These were added at a cost of £443,000 in 1970. Even then Modern studies and History resided in Huts which remained until 1999. There were as many as 13 huts at Peebles High School at this time.\n\nDue to the aforesaid pressure for space, the Millennium Wing was born, built behind the 36 block. This modern building consisted of an innovative two level development with an open and bright congregational space known as the “Atrium”. By 2000 the school had over 80 teachers and in excess of 1000 pupils.\nBy 2014, in an effort to increase access to sport, the school led an extensive campaign by the Head teacher and its community to generate a new, state of the art sports facility, funded in partnership with SBC and Sports Scotland, costing £4.8m. This extended the sports curriculum and resulted in a Gold Level Award in recognition of what was now on offer not just to students but the whole community. \n\nOn 28 November 2019, the art and the P.E. department was destroyed in a fire, reportedly caused by a kiln becoming overheated and exploding. All staff and students were evacuated safely. Later the same day, the fire was brought under control.\nExtensive reconstruction of the damaged parts of the school will be required. The affected buildings date back to the 1930s and therefore offered little resistance to an such an intense blaze.\n\n"}

One of the four major parties, it has had eight seats in the Løgting since the 2011 election, making it the joint-largest party, but it has neither of the Faroes' seats in the Folketing.\n\nFounded in 1939 as a split from the Self-Government Party and by former members of the Business Party (Vinnuflokkurin), the party has traditionally supported greater autonomy for the Faroe Islands. Party leader Hákun Djurhuus served as Prime Minister from 1963 to 1967, as did Jógvan Sundstein from 1989 to 1991. In 1998, it adopted a policy of full independence from Denmark as part of a coalition deal in which leader Anfinn Kallsberg became PM. From 2004 until 2011, except for a short period in 2008, the party has been in coalition with the Union Party and Social Democratic Party, who want to maintain the political status quo. Since November 2011 the party has been in a coalition with the Union Party (Sambandsflokkurin), the Centre Party (Miðflokkurin) and until September 2013 also with the Self-Government Party (Sjálvstýrisflokkurin), who left the coalition after their minister had been sacked.\n\nThe party is a member of the Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe. The party is affiliated to the International Democrat Union.\n\nThe party was founded in 1939 as \"Vinnuflokkurin\". The party split from the Self-Government Party over land reform, and maintained a policy of economic liberalisation and social conservatism, with the party's support based in the fishing industry and private business. The party's economic programme was one of exploitation of local resources to reduce dependence on Denmark, and success of the Sjóvinnubankin was utilised by the party to demonstrate that the Faroes could be economically self-sustaining. The party was given its current name in 1940. In the 1943 Faroese election, the party won 12 out of 25 seats: one short of an overall majority.\n\nThe People's Party entered a coalition government with the Social Democratic Party in 1990, breaking the cycle of centre-right and centre-left coalitions. The party withdrew in 1993, being replaced by left-wing parties. In the 1994 Faroese election, the party lost over a quarter of its vote, remaining outside government. However, it did return in 1996, this time with the Union Party, the Self-Government Party, and the Labour Front.\n\nIn the election in 1998, the party bounced back to its pre-1994 position, and entered into a cross-spectrum coalition with the Republican Party and the Self-Government Party, under which the People's Party adopted a policy of seeking independence. The independence plan failed in 2001, after Denmark threatened to cut economic assistance earlier than anticipated. In the following year's election, the party remained on 21% of the vote, and stayed in a renewed coalition that also included the Centre Party.\n\nWhen chairman Anfinn Kallsberg decided not to run for re-election, a new election was slated. There were two candidates, former minister of Fishery, Jørgen Niclasen, and current minister of Industry, Bjarni Djurholm. The election on 2 August 2007 gave Jørgen Niclasen the majority of the votes, making him the new party chairman. In the Danish parliamentary elections of 2007 the party received 20.5% of the Faroese vote (down from the 24.1% it had won in 2005) and lost the seat it had previously held in the Danish national Folketing. At the 2008 Faroese election, the party won 20.1% of the popular vote and seven out of 33 seats.\n\nIn early elections in 2011, the party won eight seats. In 2013 Janus Rein, who was elected for Progress, joined the Peoples Party after being a member of the Løgting without any political membership for eleven months. After this event, the Peoples Party has 9 of the 33 members of the Løgting.\n\nAt the general election 2015, the party lost two seats, they got 18.9% of the votes and 6 members. Eight days after the election, Annika Olsen who had received 961 personal votes, left the People's Party, which means that the party lost one member and now has 5 parliament members. On 4 February 2016 she became a member of the People's Party again.\n\nGenerally, the party is liberal conservative. In economics, the party is supportive of the economic liberalism.\n\nThe party supports Faroese independence from Denmark. It is one of two major parties (along with Republic) whose primary concern was historically the constitutional issue, rather than economics.\n\n\n"}

In addition to his singles success, Williams achieved notoriety in Japan in tag team competition, winning the World Tag Team Championship eight times with notable tag team partners Terry Gordy, and Vader. He also achieved great tag team success in North America, winning tag team titles in the Mid-South(UWF), World Championship Wrestling, and NWA United States Tag Team Championship as well as winning the World's Strongest Tag Determination League twice with Gordy and Mike Rotunda.\n\nWilliams attended Lakewood High School in Colorado, graduating in 1978. He was the youngest of four children born to Gerald (died 1985) and Dottie Williams (died 2016). He grew up in Lakewood where he also was living at time of his death with his mother. He was on the track & field team, played football, and wrestled all four years. Williams graduated from the University of Oklahoma in 1981 after a football career that saw him named an All-American. He also competed as an amateur wrestler, where he was a four time All American, finishing 6th as a freshman, 5th as a sophomore, 3rd as a junior and 2nd as a senior. His senior year, he lost in the finals of an NCAA tournament to future Olympic medalist Bruce Baumgartner. Already interested in professional wrestling, Williams had a ready-made nickname that dated back to an incident in junior high wherein he had to wrestle in a hockey goalie's mask due to shattering his nose and was jokingly labeled \"Dr. Death\" by one of his school's coaches and his sister.\n\nWilliams started every game in 1982 for the Oklahoma Sooners at right guard. He was named to the UPI All-Big Eight first team and played in the 1983 Fiesta Bowl. He was also a member of the Sooners 1980 Orange Bowl and 1981 Sun Bowl squads. Williams played both guard positions while at OU.\n\nWilliams was selected by the New Jersey Generals in the 1983 USFL Territorial Draft on January 3, 1983. He signed with the Generals on January 31, just prior to the opening of training camp. Williams was converted to a defensive tackle in training camp and was a teammate of RB Herschel Walker. During camp, Williams suffered a bruised knee and was placed on injured reserve for the first six games of the Generals 1983 season.\n\nAfter being activated for week #10 vs. the Birmingham Stallions on May 9, Williams was the starting nose tackle for the Generals in a 22–7 loss at Giants Stadium in the Meadowlands. The game was telecast live on ESPN. Williams started at nose tackle the following week on May 16, in a 31–24 loss to the Michigan Panthers at the Silverdome in Pontiac, MI – a game also shown on ESPN.\n\nWilliams, trained for professional wrestling by Bill Watts and Buddy Landel, started wrestling in 1982 in Watts' Mid-South Wrestling. In 1985, he formed a team with Ted DiBiase and feuded with Eddie Gilbert and The Nightmare. In 1986, Mid-South was renamed the Universal Wrestling Federation and Williams went on to win the UWF Heavyweight Championship from Big Bubba Rogers. When Jim Crockett Promotions bought the UWF in late 1987, he was one of the few UWF wrestlers to receive an initial push in the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). During this time he also worked for Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling, World Class Championship Wrestling and New Japan Pro Wrestling.\n\nWilliams became involved with Jimmy Garvin's war with Kevin Sullivan's Varsity Club in 1988, often teaming with Jimmy and Ron Garvin or Ron Simmons in various matches, including a Triple Cage \"Tower of Doom\" match at The Great American Bash in 1988. Williams, however, turned heel and joined the Varsity Club in late 1988. He and Sullivan won the NWA United States Tag Team Championship at Starrcade. They feuded with The Road Warriors and he and Mike Rotunda won the NWA World Tag Team Championship in the process.\n\nIn May 1989, Williams and Rotunda were stripped of the title, and the Varsity Club disbanded. Not long after, Williams turned face again and had a short feud with Rotunda over who was responsible for the Varsity Club's breakup, before entering a feud with Lex Luger for the NWA United States Championship. Williams was scheduled to face Luger for the title at WrestleWar '90 on February 25, 1990. When Sting, who was scheduled to face Ric Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, suffered a legitimate knee injury, Luger turned face and was moved from the US title match to the World Title match in Sting's place. Williams went to All Japan Pro Wrestling where he formed a tag team with Terry Gordy called The Miracle Violence Connection. They went on to win the WCW World Tag Team Championship from The Steiner Brothers. One week after winning the WCW World Tag Team Title, Williams and Gordy won the vacant NWA World Tag Team Title, defeating Dustin Rhodes and Barry Windham in the tournament final. Their NWA title win, however, went unrecognized by the NWA. They held onto both titles until September 1992, when they lost them to Rhodes and Windham. At Starrcade, Williams substituted for the injured Rick Rude to challenge Ron Simmons for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, but lost by disqualification. He left WCW shortly thereafter.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Williams continued to work for All Japan Pro Wrestling and became a main eventer for the company, making him one of the most successful foreign athletes in Japanese wrestling history. On July 28, 1994, he defeated Mitsuharu Misawa for the AJPW Triple Crown Championship, holding it for three months before dropping it to Toshiaki Kawada. He also sporadically wrestled in the U.S. on the independent circuit. That run was brought to an end during one of his appearances in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW). After defeating Axl Rotten in approximately 2 minutes, Williams had an impromptu ECW World Heavyweight Championship match, but lost after being pinned by then-champion Raven. The loss happened in February 1997 at \"Crossing the Line Again\", thus ending his unpinned streak in North America, which lasted since March 26, 1987.\n\nIn May 1998, Williams was signed by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) prior to the \"Brawl for All\" competition, which was set up in legitimate fights. WWF management took interest in signing him due to his success in All-Japan. Before entering the Brawl for All and signing a contract, he had only one in-ring match with the WWF, which was against 2 Cold Scorpio on a WWF Shotgun taping dark match (April 28, 1998). In his autobiography, \"How Dr. Death Became Dr. Life\", Williams stated that this was his tryout. Photos of this match were used on WWF trading cards and on the WWF's website. According to house show cards and recaps, Vince McMahon introduced him to the ring for this dark match (http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/98.htm).\n\nOn the July 20, 1998 edition of Raw is War, Williams entered the Brawl for All tournament, making his first WWF television appearance. He was expected to win it due to his reputation as one of the toughest men in the wrestling business. Williams was the contestant that the WWF management wanted to win, as he was being groomed by Vince McMahon as a possible contender for the WWF Championship that was in the possession of \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin during the Brawl for All tournament. However, after beating Pierre Carl Ouellet in the first round, he faced Bart Gunn in the second round and suffered a torn hamstring. Gunn then knocked out Williams, who missed several months following the injury. Upon healing in January 1999, Williams would work dark matches on Heat/Shotgun/Raw is War tapings, mainly against Bob Holly to open up the tapings.\n\nWilliams was involved in a brief angle where he was managed by Jim Ross in early 1999 before Williams was released. During his time with Ross, he would attack people with suplexes, debuting on the February 22, 1999 edition of Raw is War as the masked man who threw Bart Gunn off a stage during a match of his. This story was played-off on WWF television as Williams getting revenge against Gunn for his Brawl for All loss. After, Williams was involved in two midcard storylines, one where he was pursuing the WWF Hardcore Champion from Hardcore Holly, and another where he sought revenge on Tiger Ali Singh for making fun of Ross on live television. According to Williams' autobiography, as well as in his RF Video shoot interview in 2001, these midcard storylines were meant as a way to build his character up on television before entering a main-event feud with \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin. Williams was released in mid-April for needing further time to rehab his injury and for refusing to work for FMW, a Japanese promotion with which the WWF had talent exchanges. He was scheduled to compete against Snow and Holly at for the WWF Hardcore Championship, but he did not appear due to his release.\n\nAccording to an interview from November 1999 (timestamp 1:11:30), Williams was originally planned to be in Triple H's spot before his release, as much of what was previously booked for Williams was eventually given to Triple H. Most notably, the segment on the October 4, 1999 episode of Raw is War when Triple H attacked Jim Ross was the moment when Williams was going to start his feud with Austin. Because this segment was planned for Williams, this was supposed to be the moment he would become a heel, as Ross was going to manage him as a face until that point. It is unknown which month in 1999 that Williams was going to have this angle, but Williams stated in his book that his main-event push was going to start after the debut of WWF Smackdown! on UPN. Considering that Williams was released in April (also the same time Triple H began being booked as an upper mid-carder), this occurrence of events could be a possible reason as to why D-Generation X abruptly ended that month, as the WWF needed to build-up another main-eventer to feud with the likes of Austin and The Rock.\n\nIn November 1999, Williams appeared briefly in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) again, with Oklahoma as his manager in a feud with Vampiro, as a result of this feud, he wrestled against Jerry Only from the Misfits on the November 29, 1999, edition of \"WCW Monday Nitro\" in a steel cage match. He went back to All Japan Pro Wrestling and had a second stint from 2000 to 2003 and wrestled a couple of matches for WWE in 2003 against Lance Storm. In late 2003, he was involved with the independent promotion Major League Wrestling (MLW) and also wrestled for the new NWA Mid-Atlantic, where he won their title in one of the first professional wrestling events in China.\n\nOn March 14, 2004, Williams faced Belarusian kickboxer Alexey Ignashov in a mixed martial arts bout in the K-1 promotion and was knocked out 22 seconds into the fight. This was his first and only professional fight.\n\nIn 2004, Williams underwent surgery for throat cancer and was declared cancer-free the next year. His return match was against King Kaluha, who he defeated on August 27, 2005 at WrestleReunion 2. According to promoter Sal Corrente, Williams was initially hesitant to work with King Kaluha but was ultimately appreciative about the choice of opponent.\n\nWilliams made an appearance at a SmackDown! brand house show on March 11, 2006, in Alexandria, Louisiana, after which he was signed to help train up-and-coming WWE wrestlers in its Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) developmental territory. While acting in that capacity, he made a few appearances on OVW television, where he helped fellow Oklahoma wrestler Jake Hager and briefly working as his tag team partner. He also made an appearance at an August 30 Raw house show, during which he addressed the crowd and announced how happy he was to be cancer free for four years.\n\nLater, he made appearances for Oklahoma-based independent federation Sooner World Class Wrestling (SWCW). He also worked for Southwest Airlines in Colorado.\n\nAfter the death of longtime rival and friend Mitsuharu Misawa in June 2009, Williams made the decision to retire from wrestling after 27 years. Williams's final match took place August 15 in Colorado Springs, Colorado, for Asylum Championship Wrestling. He defeated Franco D'Angelo for the ACW Heavyweight Championship, which he vacated after the match.\n\nThe throat cancer eventually returned and Williams's health gradually worsened. His last public appearance was at the K&S Wrestlefest Wrestling Convention on December 12, 2009, in Carteret, New Jersey. On December 29, 2009, Williams died at St. Anthony Central Hospital in Denver from throat cancer. He was 49 years old.\n\n\n\n"}

Although the series is distributed commercially by BBC Studios, and has been sold to more than 30 countries internationally, the entirety of their net profits from the series go to Comic Relief. The first two specials were animated in stop motion by the BBC Bristol animation unit, while the third was a CGI animation by Absolute Digital Pictures. Robbie the Reindeer was created by Richard Curtis, who also was executive producer of the first two specials and co-wrote \"Hooves of Fire\".\n\nThe programmes follow Robbie, a reindeer who travels to the North Pole to join Santa's sleigh team, his encounters with the vengeful Blitzen and his relationship with love interest Donner.\n\n\nThe programme was first shown in the United States on Fox Family with the original British voices until 2001. In 2002, CBS acquired the rights to the first two specials and recorded new dialog with American actors. The American cast included: Ben Stiller (\"Robbie\"), Britney Spears (\"Donner\"), James Woods (\"Narrator\", \"Viking 1\"), Brad Garrett (\"Prancer\"), Hugh Grant (\"Blitzen\", largely imitating Coogan's original characterization), Leah Remini (\"Vixen\", \"Koala\"), Jerry Stiller (\"Old Jingle\"), Dick Enberg (\"Des Yeti\"), Dan Dierdorf (\"Allan Snowman\"), Grey DeLisle (\"Mrs. Santa\", \"Arctic Fox\", \"Female Viking\"), Rob Paulsen (\"Head Elf\", \"Viking 2/4\"), and Jim Belushi (\"Santa\", \"Little Magnus\"). CBS stopped showing the program after the 2005 holiday season, after which Nicktoons Network aired the original British version for two years. In 2016, CBS began airing the first two specials again using the American dub.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Hooves of Fire\" was released on DVD in November 2000. A \"Collector's Edition\" release adding \"Legend of the Lost Tribe\" followed in November 2003 and a collection of all three specials, subtitled \"The Whole Herd\", was released in November 2009. The 2009 release contained the special features from previous releases, including a 5.1 sound mix on \"Hooves of Fire\", directors commentary on the first two specials, the complete \"Hooves\" storyboard, behind the scenes footage and an interview with Peter Peake. In the United States, \"Hooves of Fire\" was originally released on DVD in September 2001, containing the British voice cast and the same extras as the UK release. A DVD adding \"Legend of the Lost Tribe\" was released in October 2003, this time containing both the British and American dialog tracks; This release also contained the extras from the UK edition, with the exception of the 5.1 mix and storyboards for \"Hooves of Fire\".\n\n"}

The society had 9 founding members including William Mackenzie, Maurice Nicoll and David Eder. Almost immediately, the society was caught up in the international controversy between Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud. Many of the society's membership were followers of Jung's theories, although Jones himself enjoyed a close relationship with Freud and wished for the society to be unambiguously Freudian.\n\nThe outbreak of World War One in 1914 meant that the nascent society, which depended on correspondence with psychoanalysts in Vienna, then part of Austria-Hungary, had to be suspended. There were a few informal meetings during the war, but these became less and less frequent as the war went on.\n\nIn 1919, Ernest Jones refounded the society as the British Psychoanalytical Society. He took the opportunity to define the society as Freudian in nature, removing most of the Jungian members. With the help of John Rickman, the society established a clinic and a training arm, known as the Institute of Psychoanalysis.\n\nIn the 1920s, Ernest Jones and the society grew increasingly under the influence of Melanie Klein. Jones was inspired by her writings to develop several psychoanalytical concepts. In 1925, Klein delivered a series of talks at the society, and Jones invited her to move to London, which she did shortly after. Klein's work was well received in London, but it attracted increasing controversy on the continent, where most psychoanalysts were based.\n\nThe rise of the Nazi Party in Germany and later in Austria, led to increasing numbers of German and Austrian Psychoanalysts fleeing to London, where they joined the burgeoning society. By 1937, 13 out of 71 members were refugees from Europe. Ernest Jones personally intervened to bring Sigmund Freud and his daughter, Anna Freud, to London. In 1938, Sigmund Freud wrote to Jones:\"\"The events of recent years have made London the principal site and center of the psychoanalytical movement. May the society carry out the functions thus falling to it in the most brilliant manner.\"\"By the start of the second world war, 34 out of 90 members were emigres from the continent. Among them were:\nHowever, the assimilation of so many prominent Psychoanalysts from continental Europe created tensions. The huge difference in the approaches of Anna Freud and Melanie Klein led to the development of several factions. Increasingly, presentations of papers at the society became thinly veiled attacks on opposing factions theories. For example, in March 1937 Melitta Schmideberg (Klein's daughter) presented her paper: \"After the Analysis – Some Phantasies of Patients\", which viciously attacked almost all of Klein's ideas, though it did not mention her by name.\n\nBy 1942, relations between the factions within the society had become so heated that a committee had to be convened to facilitate monthly discussions on the scientific nature of the society. The committee was chaired by three members of the society, each representing one of the major factions:\n\n\nAfter heated debate, the committee resolved to a \"gentleman's agreement\" – which ensured that each faction would have equal representation within all committees within the society. It was also agreed that training of future psychoanalysts at the institute would be organised into two pathways: one Kleinian, and one Freudian.\n\nWith the resolution of the controversial discussions, the society became dominated by independent psychoanalysts such as Donald Winnicott, Michael Balint or Wilfred Bion.\n\n\nThrough its related bodies, the Institute of Psychoanalysis and the London Clinic of Psychoanalysis, it is involved in the teaching, development, and practice of psychoanalysis at its headquarters at Byron House, west London. It is a constituent organization of the International Psychoanalytical Association and a member institution of the British Psychoanalytic Council.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1896677", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896677", "title": "Rule of Three (Wicca)", "text": "Rule of Three (Wicca)\n\nThe Rule of Three (also Three-fold Law or Law of Return) is a religious tenet held by some Wiccans/Pagans and occultists. It states that whatever energy a person puts out into the world, be it positive or negative, will be returned to that person three times. Some subscribe to a variant of this law in which return is not necessarily threefold.\n\nThe Rule of Three is sometimes described as karma by Wiccans; however, this is not strictly accurate. Both concepts describe the process of cause and effect and often encourage the individual to act in an upright way. In Hindu Vedanta literature, there is a comparable idea of threefold Karma referred to as Sanchita (accumulated works), Kriyamana, Agami, or Vartamana (current works), and Prarabdha (fructifying works), which are associated with past, present and future respectively. According to some traditions, the rule of three is not literal but symbolizes that our energy returns our way as many times as needed for us to learn the lesson associated with it.\n\nAccording to occult author/researcher John Coughlin, the Law posits \"a literal reward or punishment tied to one's actions, particularly when it comes to working magic\". The law is not a universal article of faith among Wiccans, and \"there are many Wiccans, experienced and new alike, who view the Law of Return as an over-elaboration on the Wiccan Rede.\" Some Wiccans believe that it is a modern innovation based on Christian morality.\n\nThe Rule of Three has been compared by Karl Lembke to other ethics of reciprocity, such as the concept of karma in Dharmic religions and the Golden Rule\n\nThe Rule of Three has a possible prototype in a piece of Wiccan liturgy which first appeared in print in Gerald Gardner's 1949 novel \"High Magic's Aid\":\n\nHowever, The Threefold Law as an actual \"law\", was an interpretation of Wiccan ideas and ritual, made by noted witch Monique Wilson (1923-1982) and further popularized by Raymond Buckland, in his books on Wicca. Prior to this innovation by Wilson and its subsequent inclusion in publications, Wiccan ideas of reciprocal ethics were far less defined and more often interpreted as a kind of general karma.\n\nRaymond Buckland made a reference to an ethical threefold law in a 1968 article for \"Beyond\" magazine. The Rule of Three later features within a poem of 26 couplets titled \"Rede of the Wiccae\", published by Lady Gwen Thompson in 1975 in \"Green Egg\" vol. 8, no. 69 and attributed to her grandmother Adriana Porter. The threefold rule is referenced often by the Wiccans of the Clan Mackenzie in the S.M. Stirling Emberverse novels.\n\nThis rule was described by the Dutch metal band Nemesea, in the song \"Threefold Law\", from the album \"Mana\".\n\nThough much closer to Rosicrucianism than Wicca, Rudolf Steiner's \"spiritual science\" or \"anthroposophy\" includes a type of threefold law. This is not, however, a theory of power. In Anthroposophy, the focus is on gaining the supersensible insight to bring spiritual power to any natural area of human endeavor like art, education, business, or politics - and also less obviously practical human pursuits like religion or philosophy.\n\nSteiner lays out this theory in a fairly comprehensive way in his 1904 book, \"Knowledge of Higher Worlds and its Attainment.\" In chapter two, \"The Stages of Initiation,\" he states the threefold law as follows.\n\n\"...Once the student has found the beginnings of spiritual vision by means of such exercises, he may proceed to the contemplation of man himself. Simple phenomena of human life must first be chosen. But before making any attempt in this direction it is imperative for the student to strive for the absolute purity of his moral character. He must banish all thought of ever using knowledge gained in this way for his own personal benefit. He must be convinced that he would never, under any circumstances, avail himself in an evil sense of any power he may gain over his fellow-creatures. For this reason, all who seek to discover through personal vision the secrets in human nature must follow the golden rule of true spiritual science. This golden rule is as follows: For every one step that you take in the pursuit of higher knowledge, take three steps in the perfection of your own character.\" (Knowledge of Higher Worlds and its Attainment, 1904) (\n\nThe focus of the law is not on any obvious consequences to the practitioner; it's more of a natural law. Without having taken the requisite steps, one will not \"be able to\" make an advance into true knowledge. One may get some results, but those results are likely to be delusions, into which one can fall at any time.\n\n"}

Her father Samuel Coplon was a toymaker and mother Rebecca Moroh a milliner. She went to public school Joseph F. Lamb (PS 206) in Brooklyn, New York. In high school she won an award for a good-citizenship award and a full scholarship to Barnard College. At Barnard, she majored in history and joined the Young Communist League. In 1943, she graduated cum laude. \n\nShe was recruited for Soviet espionage at Columbia University by Flora Wovschin along with Marion Davis Berdecio\n\nIn 1944, Coplon obtained a job in the US Department of Justice.. She transferred to the Foreign Agents Registration section, where she had access to counter-intelligence information, and was allegedly recruited as a spy by the NKGB at the end of 1944.\n\nEvidence later emerged that Coplon was recruited as a Soviet spy during the early months of 1945. Coplon had a meeting with Vladimir Pravdin, the NKVD station chief in New York City on 4 January 1945. Pravdin was impressed by Coplon who was described as \"very serious, shy, profound girl, ideologically close to us.\" He went on to argue: We have no doubts about the sincerity of her desire to work with us. In the course of the conversation (Coplon) underlined how much she appreciated the credit we gave to her and that, now knowing for whom she was working, she would redouble her efforts. At the very first stage of her work (Coplon) thought she was helping the local compatriots (the CPUSA)... She thought the stuff acquired by her couldn't represent an interest to the compatriots but could for an organization like the Comintern or another institution bearing a relationship to us. She added that she hoped she was working specifically for us, since she considered it the highest honor to have an opportunity to provide us with modest help.\" Soon she was recruited as a Soviet spy (codenamed Sima).\n\nCoplon became one of the NKVD's most valued sources. Her main attention was focused on the main Justice Department counterintelligence archive that collected information from the various government agencies: FBI, OSS, and naval and army intelligence. She passed to her NKVD contact a number of documents from the archive. That included FBI materials on Soviet organizations in the United States and information on leaders of the Communist Party of the United States.\n\nShe first came to the attention of the FBI as a result of a Venona message in late 1948. Coplon was known in both Soviet intelligence and the Venona files as \"SIMA.\" She was the first person tried as a result of the Venona project, but for reasons of security, the Venona information was not revealed at her trial. \n\nFBI Special Agent Robert Lamphere testified at her trial that suspicion had fallen on Coplon because of information from a reliable \"confidential informant.\" An extensive counterintelligence operation planted a secret document for her to pass to the Soviets. FBI agents arrested Coplon on March 4, 1949, in Manhattan, as she met with Valentin Gubitchev, a KGB official employed by the United Nations while she was carrying what she believed to be secret US government documents in her purse.\n\nCoplon's attorney was Archibald Palmer and Gubitchev's was Abraham Pomerantz.\n\nCoplon was convicted in two separate trials, one for espionage that began on April 25, 1949 and another for conspiracy along with Gubitchev in 1950. Both convictions were later overturned, in 1950 and 1951 respectively, on appeal.\n\nThe appellate court, sitting in New York, concluded that while the evidence showed that she was guilty, FBI agents had lied under oath about the bugging. Moreover, the opinion said that the failure to get a warrant was not justified. The court overturned the verdict, but the indictment was not dismissed. In the appeal of the Washington trial, the verdict was upheld, but because of the possible bugging, a new trial became impossible. For political and evidentiary reasons, it never took place. The legal irregularities ensured that she was never retried, and the government ultimately dropped the case in 1967.\n\nThe Coplon trials commanded nationwide attention. After her arrest but before her trials, Coplon received earnest attention from the media. \n\nFor example, Gertrude Samuels wrote for \"The New York Times\", questioning the situation: Why do some people become traitors? What turns some native-born Americans, as well as naturalized citizens, into Benedict Arnolds and Quislings? What motivates them to betray their country and themselves?... Samuels examines four kinds of traitors: professional, people loyal to their birth lands, crackpots, and idealists. In this last group, she named Elizabeth Bentley and Whittaker Chambers. To understand this group, she argues, one must understand their drive for social justice—reasons \"beyond FBI jurisdiction\" while \"few judges are bothered by motivations.\"\n\nNYT Book Review editor Sam Tanenhaus wrote in March 2011: At the time of her trial, Ms. Coplon drew a great deal of interest, particularly in the lively tabloid press of the day. A 27-year-old cum laude graduate of Barnard, employed in the internal security section of the Justice Department, she seemed the model postwar \"government girl,\" fetchingly clad in snug sweaters and New Look skirts . .  [with the] sort of attention Lindsay Lohan's courtroom appearances attract today.\n\nCoplon married one of her attorneys, Albert Socolov, and they remained married until her death in 2011. The couple had four children.\n\n\n\n"}

Later the gun saw service in the Korean War and the Vietnam War.\n\nIt was adopted in August 1910 and was derived from Hiram Maxim's Maxim gun, chambered for the standard Russian 7.62×54mmR rifle cartridge.

Its center lies on the inner normal line, and its curvature defines the curvature of the given curve at that point. This circle, which is the one among all tangent circles at the given point that approaches the curve most tightly, was named \"circulus osculans\" (Latin for \"kissing circle\") by Leibniz.\n\nThe center and radius of the osculating circle at a given point are called center of curvature and radius of curvature of the curve at that point. A geometric construction was described by Isaac Newton in his \"Principia\":\nImagine a car moving along a curved road on a vast flat plane. Suddenly, at one point along the road, the steering wheel locks in its present position. Thereafter, the car moves in a circle that \"kisses\" the road at the point of locking. The curvature of the circle is equal to that of the road at that point. That circle is the osculating circle of the road curve at that point.\n\nLet formula_1(\"s\") be a regular parametric plane curve, where \"s\" is the arc length (the natural parameter). This determines the \"unit tangent vector\" T(\"s\"), the \"unit normal vector\" N(\"s\"), the signed curvature \"k(s\") and the \"radius of curvature\" \"R(s\") at each point for which \"s\" is composed:\n\nSuppose that \"P\" is a point on \"γ\" where \"k\" ≠ 0. The corresponding center of curvature is the point \"Q\" at distance \"R\" along \"N\", in the same direction if \"k\" is positive and in the opposite direction if \"k\" is negative. The circle with center at \"Q\" and with radius \"R\" is called the osculating circle to the curve \"γ\" at the point \"P\".\n\nIf \"C\" is a regular space curve then the osculating circle is defined in a similar way, using the principal normal vector \"N\". It lies in the \"osculating plane\", the plane spanned by the tangent and principal normal vectors \"T\" and \"N\" at the point \"P\".\n\nThe plane curve can also be given in a different regular parametrization\n\nformula_3\n\nwhere regular means that formula_4 for all formula_5. Then the formulas for the signed curvature \"k\"(\"t\"), the normal unit vector \"N\"(\"t\"), the radius of curvature \"R\"(\"t\"), and the center \"Q\"(\"t\") of the osculating circle are\n\nWe can obtain the center of the osculating circle in Cartesian coordinates if we substitute formula_8 and formula_9 for some f function. If we do the calculations the results for the X and Y coordinates of the center of the osculating circle are:\n\nFor a curve \"C\" given by a sufficiently smooth parametric equations (twice continuously differentiable), the osculating circle may be obtained by a limiting procedure: it is the limit of the circles passing through three distinct points on \"C\" as these points approach \"P\". This is entirely analogous to the construction of the tangent to a curve as a limit of the secant lines through pairs of distinct points on \"C\" approaching \"P\".\n\nThe osculating circle \"S\" to a plane curve \"C\" at a regular point \"P\" can be characterized by the following properties:\nThis is usually expressed as \"the curve and its osculating circle have the second or higher order contact\" at \"P\". Loosely speaking, the vector functions representing \"C\" and \"S\" agree together with their first and second derivatives at \"P\".\n\nIf the derivative of the curvature with respect to \"s\" is nonzero at \"P\" then the osculating circle crosses the curve \"C\" at \"P\". Points \"P\" at which the derivative of the curvature is zero are called vertices. If \"P\" is a vertex then \"C\" and its osculating circle have contact of order at least three. If, moreover, the curvature has a non-zero local maximum or minimum at \"P\" then the osculating circle touches the curve \"C\" at \"P\" but does not cross it.\n\nThe curve \"C\" may be obtained as the envelope of the one-parameter family of its osculating circles. Their centers, i.e. the centers of curvature, form another curve, called the \"evolute\" of \"C\". Vertices of \"C\" correspond to singular points on its evolute.\n\nWithin any arc of a curve \"C\" within which the curvature is monotonic (that is, away from any vertex of the curve), the osculating circles are all disjoint and nested within each other. This result is known as the Tait-Kneser theorem.\n\nFor the parabola\nthe radius of curvature is\nAt the vertex formula_13 the radius of curvature equals \"R(0)=0.5\" (see figure). The parabola has fourth order contact with its osculating circle there. For large \"t\" the radius of curvature increases ~ \"t\", that is, the curve straightens more and more.\n\nA Lissajous curve with ratio of frequencies (3:2) can be parametrized as follows\n\nIt has signed curvature \"k\"(\"t\"), normal unit vector \"N\"(\"t\") and radius of curvature \"R\"(\"t\") given by\n\nand\n\nSee the figure for an animation. There the \"acceleration vector\" is the second derivative formula_18 with respect to the arc length formula_19.\n\nA cycloid with radius of r can be parametrized as follows:\n\nIts curvature is given by the following formula:\n\nwhich gives:\n\n\nFor some historical notes on the study of curvature, see\nFor application to maneuvering vehicles see\n\n"}

{"id": "1896715", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896715", "title": "Mary Beard (classicist)", "text": "Mary Beard (classicist)\n\nDame Winifred Mary Beard, (born 1 January 1955) is an English scholar of Ancient Roman civilization. \"The New Yorker\" characterises her as \"learned but accessible\".\n\nDame Mary is Professor of Classics at the University of Cambridge, a fellow of Newnham College, and Royal Academy of Arts Professor of Ancient Literature. She is the Classics editor of \"The Times Literary Supplement\", where she also writes a regular blog, \"A Don's Life\". Her frequent media appearances and sometimes controversial public statements have led to her being described as \"Britain's best-known classicist.\"\n\nDame Mary was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours and a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2018 Birthday Honours for services to the study of classical \ncivilisations.\n\nMary Beard, an only child, was born on 1 January 1955 in Much Wenlock, Shropshire. Her mother, Joyce Emily Beard, was a headmistress and an enthusiastic reader. Her father, Roy Whitbread Beard, worked as an architect in Shrewsbury. She recalled him as \"a raffish public-schoolboy type and a complete wastrel, but very engaging\".\n\nBeard was educated at Shrewsbury High School, a girls' school then funded as a direct grant grammar school. She was taught poetry by Frank McEachran, the inspiration for schoolmaster Hector in Alan Bennett's play \"The History Boys\". During the summer she would join archaeological excavations, though the motivation was, in part, just the prospect of earning some pocket-money.\n\nAt eighteen she sat the then-compulsory entrance exam and interview for Cambridge University, to win a place at Newnham College, a single-sex college. She had considered King's, but rejected it when she learned the college did not offer scholarships to women.\n\nIn Beard's first year she found that some men in the university still held very dismissive attitudes regarding the academic potential of women, which only strengthened her determination to succeed. She also developed feminist views that remained \"hugely important\" in her later life, although she later described \"modern orthodox feminism\" as partly cant. One of her tutors was Joyce Reynolds. Beard has since said that \"Newnham could do better in making itself a place where critical issues can be generated\" and has also described her views on feminism, saying \"I actually can't understand what it would be to be a woman without being a feminist.\" Beard has cited Germaine Greer's \"The Female Eunuch\", Kate Millett's \"Sexual Politics\", and Robert Munsch’s \"The Paper Bag Princess\" as influential on the development of her personal feminism.\n\nBeard graduated from Cambridge with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree: as per tradition, her BA was later promoted to a Master of Arts (MA Cantab) degree. She remained at Cambridge for her Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree: she completed it in 1982 with a doctoral thesis titled \"The State Religion in the Late Roman Republic: A Study Based on the Works of Cicero\".\n\nBetween 1979 and 1983, Beard lectured in Classics at King's College, London; she returned to Cambridge in 1984 as a Fellow of Newnham College and the only female lecturer in the Classics faculty. \"Rome in the Late Republic\", which she co-wrote with Cambridge historian Michael Crawford, was published the following year.\n\nJohn Sturrock, Classics editor of \"The Times Literary Supplement\", approached her for a review and brought her into literary journalism. Beard took over his role in 1992 at the request of Ferdinand Mount. In 1994 she made an early television appearance on an Open Media discussion for the BBC, \"Weird Thoughts\", alongside Jenny Randles and James Randi among others.\n\nShortly after the 11 September 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center, Beard was one of several authors invited to contribute articles on the topic to the \"London Review of Books\". She opined that many people, once \"the shock had faded\", thought \"the United States had it coming\", and that \"[w]orld bullies, even if their heart is in the right place, will in the end pay the price\". In a November 2007 interview, she stated that the hostility these comments provoked had still not subsided, although she believed it had become a standard viewpoint that terrorism was associated with American foreign policy. By this point she was described by Paul Laity of \"The Guardian\" as \"Britain's best-known classicist\".\n\nIn 2004, Beard became Professor of Classics at Cambridge. She was elected Visiting Sather Professor of Classical Literature for 2008–2009 at the University of California, Berkeley, where she delivered a series of lectures on \"Roman Laughter\". In 2007–2008 Beard gave the Sigmund H. Danziger Jr. Memorial Lecture in the Humanities at the University of Chicago.\n\nIn December 2010, on BBC Two, Beard presented \"Pompeii: Life and Death in a Roman Town\", submitting remains from the town to forensic tests, aiming to show a snapshot of the lives of the residents prior to the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 CE. In 2011 she took part in a television series, \"Jamie's Dream School\" on Channel 4, in which she taught classics to teenagers with no experience of academic success. Beard is a regular contributor to the BBC Radio 4 series, \"A Point of View\", delivering essays on a broad range of topics including Miss World and the Oxbridge interview.\n\nFor BBC Two in 2012 she wrote and presented the three part television series, \"Meet the Romans with Mary Beard\", which concerns how ordinary people lived in Rome, \"the world's first global metropolis\". The critic A. A. Gill reviewed the programme, writing mainly about her appearance (teeth, hair, and clothes), judging her \"too ugly for television\". Beard admitted that his attack felt like a punch, but swiftly responded with a counter-attack on his intellectual abilities, accusing him of being part of \"the blokeish culture that loves to decry clever women\". This exchange became the focus of a debate about older women on the public stage, with Beard saying she looked an ordinary woman of her age and \"there are kids who turn on these programmes and see there’s another way of being a woman\", without Botox and hair dye. Charlotte Higgins assessed Beard as one of the rare academics who is both well respected by her peers and has a high profile in the media.\n\nBeard is known for being active on Twitter, which she sees as part of her public role as an academic. Beard received considerable online abuse after she appeared on BBC's \"Question Time\" from Lincolnshire in January 2013 and cast doubt on the negative rhetoric about immigrant workers living in the county. She asserted her right to express unpopular opinions and to present herself in public in a way she deemed authentic. On 4 August 2013, she received a bomb threat on Twitter, hours after the UK head of that social networking site had apologised to women who had experienced abuse on the service. Beard said she did not think she was in physical danger, but considered it harassment and wanted to \"make sure\" that another case had been logged by the police. She has been praised for exposing \"social media at its most revolting and misogynistic\".\n\nIn 2013 she presented \"Caligula with Mary Beard\", describing the making of myths around leaders and dictators. Interviewers continued to ask about her self-presentation, and she reiterated that she had no intention of undergoing a make-over.\n\nOn 14 February 2014 Beard delivered a lecture on the public voice of women at the British Museum as part of the \"London Review of Books\" winter lecture series. \"Oh Do Shut Up, Dear!\", shown on BBC Four a month later, started with the example of Telemachus, the son of Odysseus and Penelope, admonishing his mother to retreat to her chamber. (The title alludes to Prime Minister David Cameron telling a female MP to \"Calm down, dear!\", which earned wide-spread criticism as a \"classic sexist put-down\".) Three years later, Beard gave a second lecture for the same partners, entitled \"Women in Power\", from Medusa to Merkel. It considered the extent to which the exclusion of women from power is culturally embedded, and how idioms from ancient Greece are still used to normalise gendered violence. She argues that \"we don’t have a model or a template for what a powerful woman looks like. We only have templates that make them men.\"\n\nIn December 2015, Beard was again a panelist on BBC's \"Question Time\" from Bath. During the programme, she praised Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn for behaving with a \"considerable degree of dignity\" against claims he faces an overly hostile media. She said: \"Quite a lot of what Corbyn says I agree with, and I rather like his different style of leadership. I like hearing argument not soundbites. If the Labour Party is going through a rough time, and I'm sure it is rough to be in there, it might actually all be to the good. He might be changing the party in a way that would make it easier for people like me to vote for.\"\n\n2016 saw Beard present \"Pompeii: New Secrets Revealed with Mary Beard\" on BBC One in March. While May 2016, brought about a four-part series shown on BBC Two, titled \"Mary Beard's Ultimate Rome: Empire Without Limit\".\n\nIn 2017, Beard became the target of considerable online abuse after she made the case that Roman Britain was more ethnically diverse than is often assumed. The source of the controversy was a BBC educational video depicting a senior Roman soldier as a black man, which Beard defended as entirely possible after the video received backlash. There followed, according to Beard, “a torrent of aggressive insults, on everything from my historical competence and elitist ivory tower viewpoint to my age, shape and gender [batty old broad, obese, etc etc].”\n\nBeard's standalone documentary \"Julius Caesar Revealed\" was shown on BBC One in February 2018. In March, she wrote and presented \"How Do We Look?\" and \"The Eye of Faith\", two of the nine episodes in \"Civilisations\", a reboot of the 1969 series by Kenneth Clark.\n\nOn 5 January 2019 Beard gave the sesquicentennial Public Lecture for the Society for Classical Studies, marking the 150-year anniversary of the organisation. The topic of her presentation was \"What do we mean by Classics now?\".\n\nShe delivered the Gifford Lectures in May 2019 at Edinburgh University, under the title 'The Ancient World and Us: From Fear and Loathing to Enlightenment and Ethics'.\n\nUniversity of Chicago classicist Clifford Ando described Beard's scholarship as having two key aspects in its approach to sources. One is that she insists that ancient sources be understood as documentation of the attitudes, context and beliefs of their authors, not as reliable sources for the events they address. The other is that she argues that modern histories of Rome must be contextualised within the attitudes, world views and purposes of their authors.\n\n\nIn April 2013 she was named as Royal Academy of Arts Professor of Ancient Literature. On 20 May 2019 Beard received an honorary degree from Yale University.\n\nIn response to a report in \"The Times\" of Oxfam employees engaging in sexual exploitation in disaster zones, Beard tweeted \"Of course one can’t condone the (alleged) behaviour of Oxfam staff in Haiti and elsewhere. But I do wonder how hard it must be to sustain 'civilised' values in a disaster zone. And overall I still respect those who go in and help out, where most of us would not tread.\" This led to widespread criticism, in which Mary Beard was accused of racism. In response, Beard posted a picture of herself crying, explaining that she had been subjected to a \"torrent of abuse\" and that \"I find it hard to imagine that anyone out there could possibly think that I am wanting to turn a blind eye to the abuse of women and children\".\n\nBeard married Robin Cormack, a classicist and art historian, in 1985. Their daughter Zoe is an historian of South Sudan and their son Raphael is a scholar of Egyptian literature.\n\nIn 2000, Beard revealed in an essay for the \"London Review of Books\" reviewing a book on rape that she too had been raped, in 1978.\n\nHer blog, \"A Don's Life\", gets about 40,000 hits a day, according to \"The Independent\" (2013).\n\nIn August 2014, Beard was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to \"The Guardian\" expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September's referendum on that issue. In July 2015, Beard endorsed Jeremy Corbyn's campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. She said: \"If I were a member of the Labour Party, I would vote for Corbyn. He actually seems to have some ideological commitment, which could get the Labour Party to think about what it actually stands for.\" For the 12 December 2019 general election, she was a proposer for the successful Cambridge Labour candidate Daniel Zeichner. \n\nIn 2019, Beard appeared in an episode of \"The Grand Tour\" having dinner with host James May in an effort to get his car photographed by Paparazzi.\n\n\n\n"}

The record sold nearly 20,000 copies.\n\n\"It was a great record and a great group,\" Beard told reporter Jim McConnell, \"and it fooled me into thinking that having a record label was easy.\"\n\nBeard also felt the need to record and help out other local musicians.

Population: .\n\nLittle is known of the early history of Korsakov. The site was once home to an Ainu fishing village called Kushunkotan (in Russian sources, Tamari-Aniva), which was frequented by traders of the Matsumae clan from as early as 1790. On September 22, 1853, a Russian expedition, commanded by Gennady Nevelskoy, raised the Russian flag at the settlement and renamed it \"Fort Muravyovsky\", after Governor-General of Eastern Siberia Nikolay Muravyov. Nevelskoy left detailed recollections of the landing. He encountered a predominantly Ainu population (at least 600 people; another source mentions only 300 Ainu inhabitants) as well as Japanese nationals who, judging by Nevelskoy's account, exercised authority over the native inhabitants. At the time of Nevelskoy's arrival, the village featured several standing structures—Nevelskoy calls them \"sheds\"—and even a Japanese religious temple. The villagers supposedly welcomed the Russians after they learned about their mission (protecting them from foreign incursion). Of course, the veracity of this account is in doubt, both because Nevelskoy had ulterior motives for claiming that he was \"welcomed\" by the inhabitants, and also because it is not clear to what extent the Russians were able to make themselves understood. The Russians abandoned the settlement on May 30, 1854, allegedly because their presence there, at the time of the Crimean War, raised the specter of Anglo-French attack, but returned in August 1869, now renaming the town \"Fort Korsakovsky,\" in honor of then-Governor General of Eastern Siberia Mikhail Korsakov. Lingering territorial conflict between Japan and Russia has polarized scholarly opinion of Korsakov's early history, as each side tries to claim priority of early settlement to back up their respective territorial claims in the broader region. In 1875, the whole Sakhalin including the village was ceded to Russia, under the Treaty of Saint Petersburg.\n\nWhile under Russian administration Fort Korsakovsky was an important administrative center in Sakhalin's penal servitude system and a final destination for hundreds of prisoners from European Russia, sentenced to forced labor for particularly serious crimes. Such prisoners and their families comprised early settlers of Fort Korsakovsky until its hand-over to the Japanese. Prominent Russian writers, including A.P. Chekhov and V.M. Doroshevich, visited Korsakovsky and left keen observations of its unsavory trade.\n\nDuring the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905, a naval engagement, the Battle of Korsakov, took place off the town in August 1904. In 1905, Japan conquered Sakhalin in the late stages of the war, and southern Sakhalina, including Korsakovsky, was handed over to Japan in 1905 after Russia's defeat in the war. The Russians burned the wooden town before the hand-over. Upon the ashes of Fort Korsakovsky the Japanese built a stone-clad modern city with paved streets and electricity, renaming it Ōtomari. The town was temporarily the capital of Karafuto Prefecture between 1905 and 1907. While in Japanese hands the town grew substantially. A penal colony under Russia's administration, Ōtomari maintained the practice of forced labor: the Japanese brought thousands of ethnic Koreans to Ōtomari as slave workers. Korsakov's present-day Korean population is descended mainly from those labor conscripts.\n\nIn the closing stages of World War II, the Soviet Union conquered Karafuto Prefecture, and Old Ōtomari was burned down substantially upon the entry of Soviet troops. After the war, Japan ceded Karafuto, including, Ōtomari, to the Soviet Union. The Japanese population was mostly repatriated by 1947, though a few remained, along with a sizable Korean population. The old bank, a Japanese bank building (originally, the Ōtomari Branch of Hokkaido Takushoku Bank) remains standing, though efforts to convert it into a museum came to nothing for lack of funds. Other Japanese sites and memorials were all destroyed, including a Shinto shrine and a monument to Prince Hirohito, who had visited Ōtomari on an inspection tour. An interesting sample of Japanese monuments can now be seen near Prigorodnoye, which was known as Merei before 1945, a fallen stella to Japanese soldiers.\n\nDuring the Cold War Korsakov was also the site of two Naval airfields.\n\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, Korsakov serves as the administrative center of Korsakovsky District and is subordinated to it. As a municipal division, the town of Korsakov and seventeen rural localities of Korsakovsky District are incorporated as Korsakovsky Urban Okrug.\n\nAccording to a November 1, 1945 Soviet reports, the town had:\n\nUp until the 1990s, Korsakov was a major base for the Russian Far Eastern fishing fleet. It was the home of the Base for Ocean Shipping—Baza Okeanicheskogo Rybolovstva—which, however, went bankrupt during the post-Soviet recession, perhaps for no better reason than downright looting of state property. The thousands of fishermen employed in the \"Bor\" continued their work for private fishing companies, which usually operated small fishing boats not far off the coast, often without licenses. The catch (primarily crab) was sold in Japan for hard currency, mainly in Wakkanai. Fishermen purchased Japanese electronics and used cars. This semi-illicit, semi-barter economy had a certain positive economic effect on Korsakov, though it inevitably contributed to organized crime.\n\nAmong other large economic units in Korsakov was a factory, which produced carton boxes—Fabrika Gofrirovannoy Tary. The factory operated on run-down equipment, probably left over from the Japanese times, and was visible to anyone in Korsakov, as it featured a tall chimney. Gennady Zlivko, formerly a mayor of the town, was once a director of this factory. It has long since gone bankrupt, and its tall chimney, no longer emitting black smoke, is the only thing that reminds one of the earlier years of Korsakov's economy.\n\nKorsakov is also the closest town to the huge LNG plant, constructed within the framework of the Sakhalin-2 project.\n\nCuriously, at the early stage of settlement (late 1890s), men in Korsakovsky outnumbered women almost by a factor of ten. In 1897, for example, 1510 males and 192 females lived in the town. This disbalance is explained by the fact that the majority of Korsakov's inhabitants were prisoners and prison-keepers—in both categories males predominated. The district of Korsakovsky (in 1897 covering 66762 verst) was home to 4659 males and 2194 females—a much better proportion (fort excluding).\n\nThe town's population stood at its highest (45 thousand) in the late 1980s, whereupon it experienced significant decline as inhabitants fled economic downturn by moving to neighboring Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk or to continental Russia. Evidently, Korsakov's population remains in decline, although no longer as sharp as in the 1990s.\n\nThe demographic make-up is primarily ethnic Russian with a large ethnic Korean minority.\n\nKorsakov is the 2016 bandy champions of Sakhalin.\n\nAmenities include a fairly run-down and expensive hotel (\"Alfa\") next to the former park. The beach is easily accessible by car (Okhotsk, about 1 hour and Prigorodnoye, about 30 minutes). Formerly well kept beach at Vtoraya Pad has now deteriorated into a messy junkyard.\n\nWinter sights include skating at the city stadium and excellent cross-country skiing past the former sea weed plant (Na Agarike). No facilities exist for downhill skiing.\n\nThe town features a museum with an exhibit describing the local frontier history, and the Japanese possession of the city (1905–1945). Local market on the Sovetskaya Street offers great strawberries in the summer, and nicely prepared Korean delicacies (kimchi and the local hit, the paporotnik, all year around).\nForeign tourists from certain countries or transiting via cruise ship or air are now able to visit the town without a visa for 72 hours.\n\nThe town has its executive (the mayor's office or \"municipal administration\", and its legislature (Duma). In practice, the Duma exercises fairly limited influence over the executive.\n\nList of mayors:\n\nKorsakov is located about from the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Airport. Regular bus and minibus services connect Korsakov with the capital city of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, though not with the airport. A passenger ferry service between Korsakov and Wakkanai, Hokkaidō, Japan, across the Aniva Gulf, was re-established in 2016 and is in operation between June and September of each year. The passenger ferry service is operated by the Commonwealth of Dominica flagged vessel Penguin 33, which is High-speed craft owned by Penguin International Limited, a Singaporean-owned publicly listed company. \n\nThe Japan National Rail passenger ferry service previously operated a service from Wakkanai, called \"Chihaku-Renrakusen (Chihaku Ferry Service)\" from 1923–1945, which was linked to Japan's national rail network and to Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk (then called Toyohara). The old narrow-gauge Japanese railroad still runs along the scenic coastline, with sporadic rail service.\n\nThere are several bus lines servicing the urban area and a number of villages in the proximity.\n\nThe city has a large seaport.\n\nKorsakov is twinned with:\n\n\n"}

He was appointed as the first Chief Engineer to the Northern Lighthouse Board in 1786.\n\nSmith was born in Broughty Ferry near Dundee on 6 December 1752. His father, a skipper, drowned in Dundee harbour while Thomas was still young. As a result, his mother encouraged him towards a career onshore, leading him initially into ironmongery. While his widowed mother remained in Broughty Ferry, Smith went on to establish himself in Edinburgh.\n\nIn Edinburgh Smith founded and appears to have been the sole proprietor of a successful business in lamps and oils called the Greenside Company’s Works. Smith won a contract to provide improved street lighting for Edinburgh’s burgeoning New Town. \n\nThe oil lamps he provided featured parabolic reflectors made from burnished copper, which concentrated the light and enhanced its brightness. Manufacturing such reflectors within tight tolerances was not straightforward, but the innovations devised by Smith gave his lamps quadruple the power of standard oil-lit lamps without any kind of reflector.\n\nThe success of Smith's work in street lighting provided him with the connections and qualifications which resulted in his appointment as Chief Engineer to the newly-formed Northern Lighthouse Trust (now Northern Lighthouse Board) in 1786. He was commissioned to build the first four modern lighthouses and promptly dispatched south to pick-up technical expertise from an English lighthouse builder (possibly John Smeaton, who built the pioneering third Eddystone Lighthouse in the 1750s, or perhaps Ezekiel Walker or William Hutchinson).\n\nUpon his return Smith set about the construction of the four new lighthouses at Kinnaird Head, Mull of Kintyre, Eilean Glas, and North Ronaldsay. As well as the design and construction, Smith had to overcome significant financial, logistical and supply-chain challenges resulting from the remote locations of the projects. Nonetheless, all four lighthouses were successfully constructed. \n\nSmith quickly adopted the newly invented Argand lamp, which with its circular wick and glass chimney gave a much brighter light than traditional wick lamps. Most significantly, he combined this with his parabolic reflectors resulting in a combination which came to be known as the catoptric system and set the standard for lighthouse illumination at that time.\n\nThe first of his lighthouses - Kinnaird Head (1787) - had 17 whale-oil lamps backed by parabolic reflectors and was said to be the most powerful light of its day with a reported range of 12 to 14 miles (10 to 12 mmi; 19 to 23km). Smith continued to experiment and improve on his designs over the coming years and it was one of his last designs, Start Point, Sanday (1806), which incorporated a revolving light which was to become universal. \n\nSmith stepped-down from his role with the Northern Lighthouse Board in 1808 and was succeeded by his stepson Robert Stevenson. However, he remained active in his private business. \n\nIn 1792 - five years after his appointment to the Northern Lighthouse Board - Smith married his third wife, Jean Lille Stevenson (1751-1820). \n\nPrior to this, Smith had been twice widowed. He had five children by his first wife, though only a daughter (Jane) and son (James) survived infancy. He had one further daughter (Mary-Anne), by his second wife.\n\nJean Lille Stevenson was herself a widow, with a young son called Robert Stevenson. Her first husband was Alan Stevenson, a partner in a West Indies sugar trading house in Glasgow who died of epidemic fever on the island of St. Christopher in the West Indies in 1774 leaving Jean Lille in precarious financial circumstances.\n\nThe new family initially lived at 1 Blair Street off the Royal Mile in Edinburgh's Old Town, before moving to the then newly built 2 Baxter's Place at the head of Leith Walk in 1798/9.\n\nThe relationship between Thomas Smith and his step-son Robert Stevenson proved to be close and admiring. Though Stevenson’s mother had intended him for a career in the ministry, he instead became a keen assistant to his step-father’s works and was formally apprenticed to Smith in 1791. This relationship was further cemented by an unusual circumstance: in 1799 Stevenson married his then 20 year old step-sister Jane. The following year, Stevenson became a full partner in Smith’s firm and eventually succeeded him as Chief Engineer to the Northern Lighthouse Board in 1808, initiating a dynasty of Stevenson’s as lighthouse builders.\n\nLittle is known about Thomas Smith’s own son James except that he left home to found his own ironmongery business, but whether this was due to some rift with his father is unknown. His daughter Janet was mother to the physicist William Swan. \n\nSmith died at home in 2 Baxter's Place in on 21 June 1815, aged 62. He is buried in the north-east section of Old Calton Burial Ground. Upon his death, it was Robert Stevenson who inherited the house.\n\n\n"}

He was the brother of Hiram Stevens Maxim, inventor of the Maxim gun and uncle of Hiram Percy Maxim, inventor of the Maxim Silencer.\n\nMaxim started his career in 1881 as the publisher of \"Real Pen Work - Self Instructor in Penmanship\", a book addressing the arts of calligraphy and penmanship, and the sale of special inks, pens, and other supplies related to penmanship. Later he joined his brother Hiram Stevens Maxim's workshop in the United Kingdom, where they both worked on the improvement of smokeless gunpowder. After some disputes, Hudson Maxim returned to the United States and developed a number of stable high explosives, the rights of which were sold to the DuPont company.\n\nDuring World War I, Maxim wrote a book, \"Defenseless America\", in which he pointed out the inferiority of the American defence system and the vulnerability of the country against attacks of foreign aggressors. His good friend, Elbert Hubbard, died on the RMS Lusitania when it was torpedoed by a German submarine. This event fueled his belief that the USA should improve its defenses and join the war against Germany on the side of the Entente.\n\nMaxim also wrote the book \"The Science of Poetry and the Philosophy of Language\" about the nature and writing of poetry. In this work, he contended that words, like chemical particles, had natural laws that governed the manner in which they could be combined into verse, and that poetry perceived as excellent was in fact one that conformed to those laws. He also argued that certain famous poets (William Shakespeare, William Wordsworth) had discovered those laws and put them to use in their poetry.\n\nDuring his experimental career, he lost his left hand in a mercury fulminate explosion in 1894.\n\nDuring the last 25 years of his life, Maxim spent most of his time at his home on the shores of Lake Hopatcong, New Jersey. He was a great promoter and supporter of the development of Lake Hopatcong and the Borough of Hopatcong and is honored by memorials in Hopatcong State Park and the Borough of Hopatcong's Maxim Glen Park. He spoke and wrote prolifically on many topics - from his opposition to maintaining the Morris Canal, to his disdain of Prohibition, to his love of poetry and boxing.\n\nMaxim appeared as King Neptune during the first two years of the Miss America Pageant in 1921 and 1922, arriving on a great float and presenting the trophy to the winner.\n\nHe was an important member of the College of Fellows of the Academy of Nations.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1896765", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896765", "title": "George Griffith", "text": "George Griffith\n\nGeorge Griffith (1857–1906), full name George Chetwynd Griffith-Jones, was a prolific British science fiction writer and noted explorer who wrote during the late Victorian and Edwardian age. Many of his visionary tales appeared in magazines such as \"Pearson's Magazine\" and \"Pearson's Weekly\" before being published as novels. Griffith was extremely popular in the United Kingdom, though he failed to find similar acclaim in the United States, in part due to his utopian socialist views. A journalist, rather than a scientist, by background, what his stories lack in scientific rigour and literary grace they make up for in sheer exuberance of execution.\n\nHe was the son of a vicar who became a schoolmaster in his mid-20s. After writing freelance articles in his spare time, he joined a newspaper for a short spell, then authored a series of secular pamphlets including \"Ananias, The Atheist's God: For the Attention of Charles Bradlaugh\". After the success of Admiral Philip H. Colomb's \"The Great War of 1892\" (itself a version of the more famous \"The Battle of Dorking\"), Griffith, then on the staff of \"Pearson's Magazine\" as a clerk addressing envelopes and mailing labels, submitted a synopsis for a story entitled \"The Angel of the Revolution\". It remains his best and most famous work. It was among the first of the so-called \"marvel tales,\" epitomised by Jules Verne. Marvel tales featured such things as heavier-than-air flying machines, compressed air guns, submarines, profoundly convenient political developments, wooden heroes with no readily apparent sexual tastes, and spectacular aerial, land, or undersea combat. Later novels, such as \"The Gold Finder\" developed the heroes' romantic interests. His short stories were very similar to the future war tales of George Chesney and his imitators along with the political utopianism of William Morris' \"News from Nowhere\". He wrote a sequel, serialised as \"The Syren of the Skies\" in \"Pearson's Magazine\". It was later published as a novel titled with the name of its main character, \"Olga Romanoff\".\nAlthough overshadowed by H. G. Wells in the United States, Griffith's epic fantasies of romantic utopians in a future world of war, dominated by airship battle fleets, and grandiose engineering provided a template for steampunk novels 100 years before the term was even coined. Michael Moorcock claims that the works of George Griffith had a dramatic impact on his own writing. The concept of revolutionaries imposing \"a \"pax aeronautica\" over the earth\", at the center of \"The Angel of the Revolution\", was taken up by Wells many years later, in \"The Shape of Things to Come\". Wells himself once wrote that Griffith's \"Outlaws of the Air\" was an \"aeronautical classic\".\n\nThough a less accomplished writer than Upton Sinclair, George Bernard Shaw, and H.G. Wells, his novels were extremely popular in their day, seeing many printings . Griffith's stories foreshadowed World War I and foretold a utopian communist revolution in the United States. It also predicted that Great Britain would ally itself with Germany against a Franco-Russian-Italian alliance, almost the exact opposite of what actually happened when World War I started. Griffith also employed the concepts of the air to surface missile and VTOL aircraft. He wrote several tales of adventure set on contemporary earth, while \"The Outlaws of the Air\" depicted a future of aerial warfare and the creation of a Pacific island utopia. Sam Moskowitz described him as \"undeniably the most popular science fiction writer in England between 1893 and 1895.\" Some of his books (especially \"The Gold Finder\") also reflected a belief in the undesirability of racial mixing, due to a supposed deficiency in the black race. These beliefs were similar to those of some of the revolutionary type of socialists of the time, such as Jack London.\n\nHis science fiction depicted grand and unlikely voyages through our solar system in the spirit of Wells or Jules Verne, though his explorers donned space suits remarkably prescient in their design. \"Honeymoon in Space\" saw his newly married adventurers, exemplars of the \"Race that Rules\", exploring planets in different stages of geological and Darwinian evolution on an educational odyssey drawing heavily on earlier cosmic voyages by Camille Flammarion, W. S. Lach-Szyrma, and Edgar Fawcett. Its illustrations by Stanley L. Wood have proved more significant, providing the first depictions of slender, super-intelligent aliens with large, bald heads – the archetype of the famous Greys of modern science fiction. His short story \"The Great Crellin Comet\", published in 1897, was the first story to not only include a 10-second countdown for a space launch (though a countdown of sorts is included in Jules Verne's 1887 novel, \"The Purchase of the North Pole\"), but also the first story to suggest that a cometary collision with the earth could be stopped by human intervention.\n\nAs an explorer of the real world, he shattered the existing record for voyaging around the world at the behest of Sir Arthur Pearson, completing his journey in just 65 days. He also helped discover the source of the Amazon River. This was documented in \"Pearson's Magazine\" before being published as a book, \"Around the World in 65 Days\", in 2009. He died of cirrhosis of the liver, at the age of 48, in 1906.\n\nHis son was the engineer Alan Arnold Griffith, who was the originator of the Griffith crack theory concerning brittle materials such as glass.\n\n\nFrom 2003 onwards Heliograph Inc. published editions of \"A Honeymoon in Space\" and \"Stories of Other Worlds\", \"The Angel of the Revolution\" and \"The Syren of the Skies\".\n\nIn 2006 Apogee Books released \"The World Peril of 1910\" as part of its series of classic science fiction.\n\nIn 2008 Apogee released \"Around the World in 65 Days\", an anthology of travel writing. The book collects Griffith's world travels, including one trip around the world done in a record-breaking 65 days. In addition, many of Griffith's other adventures are included. His trip to South America is recounted in \"A Railway Beyond the Clouds\", \"A Ride to the City of the Sun\", \"A Paradise of Tomorrow\", \"The Most Majestic Mountain\", and \"Los Medanos\". His travels of North America in \"The Snake-Dancers of Arizona\" are somehow even more exotic. Griffith claims to have made the first intentional flight across the English Channel in \"To France by Air\". In \"When will the 20th Century Begin?\", Griffith discusses the intricacies of time zones, something with which he had quite a lot of practice. The Apogee edition includes an introduction by Griffith's grandson, John Griffith, relating some of the family history, particularly of Alan Arnold Griffith, and a biography of George Griffith by editor Robert Godwin. \n\nIn 2009, Leonaur Press released \"The Angel of the Revolution\" and \"Olga Romanoff\" as a two-volume set entitled \"Empire of the Air\" in both hardback and paperback.\n\nIn 2011 Apogee Books released \"A Honeymoon in Space\".\n\n\n"}

Here the Greek letter represents a constant, approximately equal to 3.14159, which is equal to the ratio of the circumference of any circle to its diameter.\n\nOne method of deriving this formula, which originated with Archimedes, involves viewing the circle as the limit of a sequence of regular polygons. The area of a regular polygon is half its perimeter multiplied by the distance from its center to its sides, and the corresponding formula (that the area is half the perimeter times the radius, i.e. ) holds in the limit for a circle.\n\nAlthough often referred to as the area of a circle in informal contexts, strictly speaking the term \"disk\" refers to the interior of the circle, while \"circle\" is reserved for the boundary only, which is a curve and covers no area itself. Therefore, the area of a disk is the more precise phrase for the area enclosed by a circle.\n\nModern mathematics can obtain the area using the methods of integral calculus or its more sophisticated offspring, real analysis. However the area of a disk was studied by the Ancient Greeks. Eudoxus of Cnidus in the fifth century B.C. had found that the area of a disk is proportional to its radius squared. Archimedes used the tools of Euclidean geometry to show that the area inside a circle is equal to that of a right triangle whose base has the length of the circle's circumference and whose height equals the circle's radius in his book \"Measurement of a Circle\". The circumference is 2\"r\", and the area of a triangle is half the base times the height, yielding the area  \"r\" for the disk. Prior to Archimedes, Hippocrates of Chios was the first to show that the area of a disk is proportional to the square of its diameter, as part of his quadrature of the lune of Hippocrates, but did not identify the constant of proportionality.\n\nA variety of arguments have been advanced historically to establish the equation formula_1 to varying degrees of mathematical rigor. The most famous of these is Archimedes' method of exhaustion, one of the earliest uses of the mathematical concept of a limit, as well as the origin of Archimedes' axiom which remains part of the standard analytical treatment of the real number system. The original proof of Archimedes is not rigorous by modern standards, because it assumes that we can compare the length of arc of a circle to the length of a secant and a tangent line, and similar statements about the area, as geometrically evident.\n\nThe area of a regular polygon is half its perimeter times the apothem. As the number of sides of the regular polygon increases, the polygon tends to a circle, and the apothem tends to the radius. This suggests that the area of a disk is half the circumference of its bounding circle times the radius.\n\nFollowing Archimedes' argument in \"The Measurement of a Circle\" (c. 260 BCE), compare the area enclosed by a circle to a right triangle whose base has the length of the circle's circumference and whose height equals the circle's radius. If the area of the circle is not equal to that of the triangle, then it must be either greater or less. We eliminate each of these by contradiction, leaving equality as the only possibility. We use regular polygons in the same way.\n\nSuppose that the area \"C\" enclosed by the circle is greater than the area \"T\" = ⁄\"cr\" of the triangle. Let \"E\" denote the excess amount. Inscribe a square in the circle, so that its four corners lie on the circle. Between the square and the circle are four segments. If the total area of those gaps, \"G\", is greater than \"E\", split each arc in half. This makes the inscribed square into an inscribed octagon, and produces eight segments with a smaller total gap, \"G\". Continue splitting until the total gap area, \"G\", is less than \"E\". Now the area of the inscribed polygon, \"P\" = \"C\" − \"G\", must be greater than that of the triangle.\nBut this forces a contradiction, as follows. Draw a perpendicular from the center to the midpoint of a side of the polygon; its length, \"h\", is less than the circle radius. Also, let each side of the polygon have length \"s\"; then the sum of the sides, \"ns\", is less than the circle circumference. The polygon area consists of \"n\" equal triangles with height \"h\" and base \"s\", thus equals ⁄\"nhs\". But since \"h\" < \"r\" and \"ns\" < \"c\", the polygon area must be less than the triangle area, ⁄\"cr\", a contradiction. Therefore, our supposition that \"C\" might be greater than \"T\" must be wrong.\n\nSuppose that the area enclosed by the circle is less than the area \"T\" of the triangle. Let \"D\" denote the deficit amount. Circumscribe a square, so that the midpoint of each edge lies on the circle. If the total area gap between the square and the circle, \"G\", is greater than \"D\", slice off the corners with circle tangents to make a circumscribed octagon, and continue slicing until the gap area is less than \"D\". The area of the polygon, \"P\", must be less than \"T\".\nThis, too, forces a contradiction. For, a perpendicular to the midpoint of each polygon side is a radius, of length \"r\". And since the total side length is greater than the circumference, the polygon consists of \"n\" identical triangles with total area greater than \"T\". Again we have a contradiction, so our supposition that \"C\" might be less than \"T\" must be wrong as well.\n\nTherefore, it must be the case that the area enclosed by the circle is precisely the same as the area of the triangle. This concludes the proof.\n\nFollowing Satō Moshun and Leonardo da Vinci , we can use inscribed regular polygons in a different way. Suppose we inscribe a hexagon. Cut the hexagon into six triangles by splitting it from the center. Two opposite triangles both touch two common diameters; slide them along one so the radial edges are adjacent. They now form a parallelogram, with the hexagon sides making two opposite edges, one of which is the base, \"s\". Two radial edges form slanted sides, and the height, \"h\" is equal to its apothem (as in the Archimedes proof). In fact, we can also assemble all the triangles into one big parallelogram by putting successive pairs next to each other. The same is true if we increase it to eight sides and so on. For a polygon with 2\"n\" sides, the parallelogram will have a base of length \"ns\", and a height \"h\". As the number of sides increases, the length of the parallelogram base approaches half the circle circumference, and its height approaches the circle radius. In the limit, the parallelogram becomes a rectangle with width \"r\" and height \"r\".\n\nThere are various equivalent definitions of the constant π. The conventional definition in pre-calculus geometry is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter:\nHowever, because the circumference of a circle is not a primitive analytical concept, this definition is not suitable in modern rigorous treatments. A standard modern definition is that is equal to twice the least positive root of the cosine function or, equivalently, the half-period of the sine (or cosine) function. The cosine function can be defined either as a power series, or as the solution of a certain differential equation. This avoids any reference to circles in the definition of , so that statements about the relation of to the circumference and area of circles are actually theorems, rather than definitions, that follow from the analytical definitions of concepts like \"area\" and \"circumference\".\n\nThe analytical definitions are seen to be equivalent, if it is agreed that the circumference of the circle is measured as a rectifiable curve by means of the integral\nThe integral appearing on the right is an abelian integral whose value is a half-period of the sine function, equal to . Thus formula_6 is seen to be true as a theorem.\n\nSeveral of the arguments that follow use only concepts from elementary calculus to reproduce the formula formula_1, but in many cases to regard these as actual proofs, they rely implicitly on the fact that one can develop trigonometric functions and the fundamental constant in a way that is totally independent of their relation to geometry. We have indicated where appropriate how each of these proofs can be made totally independent of all trigonometry, but in some cases that requires more sophisticated mathematical ideas than those afforded by elementary calculus.\n\nUsing calculus, we can sum the area incrementally, partitioning the disk into thin concentric rings like the layers of an onion. This is the method of shell integration in two dimensions. For an infinitesimally thin ring of the \"onion\" of radius \"t\", the accumulated area is 2\"t dt\", the circumferential length of the ring times its infinitesimal width (one can approximate this ring by a rectangle with width=2\"t\" and height=\"dt\"). This gives an elementary integral for a disk of radius \"r\".\n\nIt is rigorously justified by the multivariate substitution rule in polar coordinates. Namely, the area is given by a double integral of the constant function 1 over the disk itself. If \"D\" denotes the disk, then the double integral can be computed in polar coordinates as follows:\nwhich is the same result as obtained above.\n\nAn equivalent rigorous justification, without relying on the special coordinates of trigonometry, uses the coarea formula. Define a function formula_10 by formula_11. Note ρ is a Lipschitz function whose gradient is a unit vector formula_12 (almost everywhere). Let \"D\" be the disc formula_13 in formula_14. We will show that formula_15, where formula_16 is the two-dimensional Lebesgue measure in formula_14. We shall assume that the one-dimensional Hausdorff measure of the circle formula_18 is formula_19, the circumference of the circle of radius \"r\". (This can be taken as the definition of circumference.) Then, by the coarea formula, \n\nSimilar to the onion proof outlined above, we could exploit calculus in a different way in order to arrive at the formula for the area of a disk. Consider unwrapping the concentric circles to straight strips. This will form a right angled triangle with r as its height and 2r (being the outer slice of onion) as its base.\n\nFinding the area of this triangle will give the area of the disk\n\nThe opposite and adjacent angles for this triangle are respectively in degrees 9.0430611..., 80.956939... and in radians 0.1578311... , 1.4129651...\n\nExplicitly, we imagine dividing up a circle into triangles, each with a height equal to the circle's radius and a base that is infinitesimally small. The area of each of these triangles is equal to formula_22. By summing up (integrating) all of the areas of these triangles, we arrive at the formula for the circle's area:\n\nIt too can be justified by a double integral of the constant function 1 over the disk by reversing the order of integration and using a change of variables in the above iterated integral:\nMaking the substitution formula_25 converts the integral to\nwhich is the same as the above result.\n\nThe triangle proof can be reformulated as an application of Green's theorem in flux-divergence form (i.e. a two-dimensional version of the divergence theorem), in a way that avoids all mention of trigonometry and the constant . Consider the vector field formula_27 in the plane. So the divergence of r is equal to two, and hence the area of a disc \"D\" is equal to\nBy Green's theorem, this is the same as the outward flux of r across the circle bounding \"D\":\nwhere n is the unit normal and \"ds\" is the arc length measure. For a circle of radius \"R\" centered at the origin, we have formula_30 and formula_31, so the above equality is\n\nThe integral of \"ds\" over the whole circle formula_33 is just the arc length, which is its circumference, so this shows that the area \"A\" enclosed by the circle is equal to formula_34 times the circumference of the circle.\n\nAnother proof that uses triangles considers the area enclosed by a circle to be made up of an infinite number of triangles (i.e. the triangles each have an angle of ' at the centre of the circle), each with an area of ' (derived from the expression for the area of a triangle: \"\"). Note that \"≈ \" due to small angle approximation. Through summing the areas of the triangles, the expression for the area of the circle can therefore be found:\n\nformula_35\n\nNote that the area of a semicircle of radius r can be computed by the integral formula_36.\n\nBy trigonometric substitution, we substitute formula_37, hence formula_38\n\nThe last step follows since the trigonometric identity formula_43 implies that formula_44 and formula_45 have equal integrals over the interval formula_46, using integration by substitution. But on the other hand, since formula_47, the sum of the two integrals is the length of that interval, which is formula_48. Consequently, the integral of formula_49 is equal to half the length of that interval, which is formula_50.\n\nTherefore, the area of a circle of radius \"r\", which is twice the area of the semi-circle, is equal to formula_51.\n\nThis particular proof may appear to beg the question, if the sine and cosine functions involved in the trigonometric substitution are regarded as being defined in relation to circles. However, as noted earlier, it is possible to define sine, cosine, and in a way that is totally independent of trigonometry, in which case the proof is valid by the change of variables formula and Fubini's theorem, assuming the basic properties of sine and cosine (which can also be proved without assuming anything about their relation to circles).\n\nThe circle is the closed curve of least perimeter that encloses the maximum area. This is known as the isoperimetric inequality, which states that if a rectifiable Jordan curve in the Euclidean plane has perimeter \"C\" and encloses an area \"A\" (by the Jordan curve theorem) then\nMoreover, equality holds in this inequality if and only if the curve is a circle, in which case formula_1 and formula_54.\n\nThe calculations Archimedes used to approximate the area numerically were laborious, and he stopped with a polygon of 96 sides. A faster method uses ideas of Willebrord Snell (\"Cyclometricus\", 1621), further developed by Christiaan Huygens (\"De Circuli Magnitudine Inventa\", 1654), described in .\n\nGiven a circle, let \"u\" be the perimeter of an inscribed regular \"n-\"gon, and let \"U\" be the perimeter of a circumscribed regular \"n-\"gon. Then \"u\" and \"U\" are lower and upper bounds for the circumference of the circle that become sharper and sharper as \"n\" increases, and their average (\"u\" + \"U\")/2 is an especially good approximation to the circumference. To compute \"u\" and \"U\" for large \"n\", Archimedes derived the following doubling formulae:\n\nStarting from a hexagon, Archimedes doubled \"n\" four times to get a 96-gon, which gave him a good approximation to the circumference of the circle.\n\nIn modern notation, we can reproduce his computation (and go further) as follows.\nFor a unit circle, an inscribed hexagon has \"u\" = 6, and a circumscribed hexagon has \"U\" = 4.\nDoubling seven times yields\n\nThe last entry of the table has ⁄ as one of its best rational approximations;\ni.e., there is no better approximation among rational numbers with denominator up to 113.\nThe number ⁄ is also an excellent approximation to , better than any other rational number with denominator less than 16604.\n\nSnell proposed (and Huygens proved) a tighter bound than Archimedes':\nThis for \"n\" = 48 gives a better approximation (about 3.14159292) than Archimedes' method for \"n\" = 768.\n\nLet one side of an inscribed regular \"n-\"gon have length \"s\" and touch the circle at points A and B. Let A′ be the point opposite A on the circle, so that A′A is a diameter, and A′AB is an inscribed triangle on a diameter. By Thales' theorem, this is a right triangle with right angle at B. Let the length of A′B be \"c\", which we call the complement of \"s\"; thus \"c\"+\"s\" = (2\"r\"). Let C bisect the arc from A to B, and let C′ be the point opposite C on the circle. Thus the length of CA is \"s\", the length of C′A is \"c\", and C′CA is itself a right triangle on diameter C′C. Because C bisects the arc from A to B, C′C perpendicularly bisects the chord from A to B, say at P. Triangle C′AP is thus a right triangle, and is similar to C′CA since they share the angle at C′. Thus all three corresponding sides are in the same proportion; in particular, we have C′A : C′C = C′P : C′A and AP : C′A = CA : C′C. The center of the circle, O, bisects A′A, so we also have triangle OAP similar to A′AB, with OP half the length of A′B. In terms of side lengths, this gives us\nIn the first equation C′P is C′O+OP, length \"r\"+⁄\"c\", and C′C is the diameter, 2\"r\". For a unit circle we have the famous doubling equation of Ludolph van Ceulen,\nIf we now circumscribe a regular \"n-\"gon, with side A″B″ parallel to AB, then OAB and OA″B″ are similar triangles, with A″B″ : AB = OC : OP. Call the circumscribed side \"S\"; then this is \"S\" : \"s\" = 1 : ⁄\"c\". (We have again used that OP is half the length of A′B.) Thus we obtain\nCall the inscribed perimeter \"u\" = \"ns\", and the circumscribed perimeter \"U\" = \"nS\". Then combining equations, we have\nso that\nThis gives a geometric mean equation.\n\nWe can also deduce\nor\nThis gives a harmonic mean equation.\n\nWhen more efficient methods of finding areas are not available, we can resort to “throwing darts”. This Monte Carlo method uses the fact that if random samples are taken uniformly scattered across the surface of a square in which a disk resides, the proportion of samples that hit the disk approximates the ratio of the area of the disk to the area of the square. This should be considered a method of last resort for computing the area of a disk (or any shape), as it requires an enormous number of samples to get useful accuracy; an estimate good to 10 requires about 100 random samples .\n\nWe have seen that by partitioning the disk into an infinite number of pieces we can reassemble the pieces into a rectangle. A remarkable fact discovered relatively recently is that we can dissect the disk into a large but \"finite\" number of pieces and then reassemble the pieces into a square of equal area. This is called Tarski's circle-squaring problem. The nature of Laczkovich's proof is such that it proves the existence of such a partition (in fact, of many such partitions) but does not exhibit any particular partition.\n\nCircles can be defined in non-Euclidean geometry, and in particular in the hyperbolic and elliptic planes.\n\nFor example, the unit sphere formula_65 is a model for the two-dimensional elliptic plane. It carries an intrinsic metric that arises by measuring geodesic length. The geodesic circles are the parallels in a geodesic coordinate system.\n\nMore precisely, fix a point formula_66 that we place at the zenith. Associated to that zenith is a geodesic polar coordinate system formula_67, formula_68, formula_69, where z is the point formula_70. In these coordinates, the geodesic distance from z to any other point formula_71 having coordinates formula_67 is the value of formula_73 at x. A spherical circle is the set of points a geodesic distance \"R\" from the zenith point z. Equivalently, with a fixed embedding into formula_74, the spherical circle of radius formula_75 centered at z is the set of x in formula_65 such that formula_77.\n\nWe can also measure the area of the spherical disk enclosed within a spherical circle, using the intrinsic surface area measure on the sphere. The area of the disk of radius \"R\" is then given by\n\nMore generally, if a sphere formula_79 has radius of curvature formula_80, then the area of the disk of radius \"R\" is given by\nObserve that, as an application of L'Hôpital's rule, this tends to the Euclidean area formula_82 in the flat limit formula_83.\n\nThe hyperbolic case is similar, with the area of a disk of intrinsic radius \"R\" in the (constant curvature formula_84) hyperbolic plane given by\nwhere cosh is the hyperbolic cosine. More generally, for the constant curvature formula_86 hyperbolic plane, the answer is\n\nThese identities are important for comparison inequalities in geometry. For example, the area enclosed by a circle of radius \"R\" in a flat space is always greater than the area of a spherical circle and smaller than a hyperbolic circle, provided all three circles have the same (intrinsic) radius. That is,\nfor all formula_89. Intuitively, this is because the sphere tends to curve back on itself, yielding circles of smaller area than those in the plane, whilst the hyperbolic plane, when immersed into space, develops fringes that produce additional area. It is more generally true that the area of the circle of a fixed radius \"R\" is a strictly decreasing function of the curvature.\n\nIn all cases, if formula_90 is the curvature (constant, positive or negative), then the isoperimetric inequality for a domain with area \"A\" and perimeter \"L\" is\nwhere equality is achieved precisely for the circle.\n\nWe can stretch a disk to form an ellipse. Because this stretch is a linear transformation of the plane, it has a distortion factor which will change the area but preserve \"ratios\" of areas. This observation can be used to compute the area of an arbitrary ellipse from the area of a unit circle.\n\nConsider the unit circle circumscribed by a square of side length 2. The transformation sends the circle to an ellipse by stretching or shrinking the horizontal and vertical diameters to the major and minor axes of the ellipse. The square gets sent to a rectangle circumscribing the ellipse. The ratio of the area of the circle to the square is /4, which means the ratio of the ellipse to the rectangle is also /4. Suppose \"a\" and \"b\" are the lengths of the major and minor axes of the ellipse. Since the area of the rectangle is \"ab\", the area of the ellipse is \"ab\"/4.\n\nWe can also consider analogous measurements in higher dimensions. For example, we may wish to find the volume inside a sphere. When we have a formula for the surface area, we can use the same kind of “onion” approach we used for the disk.\n\n\n"}

The band played its first show in May 1993 at Topside Church of God in Louisville, TN and recorded its first three-song demo at Nightsong Studios with Producer Jesse Jones. Adrian DiTommasi left the band shortly after that for personal reasons, and Kevin Young would eventually take over the bass guitar duties. Later that year, Disciple recorded its first full length recording titled \"Trail of Tears\" at Nightsong Studios with Jesse Jones which was a cassette-only independent release. In 1994 the band recorded its second full length recording titled \"Lake of Fire\" which was also a cassette-only independent release recorded at Nightsong Studios with producer Jesse Jones.\n\nIn late 1995, Disciple released \"What Was I Thinking\" on their own independent label Slain Records. The album was produced by first-time producer Travis Wyrick, former guitar player of the band Sage. It was the first Disciple album available on CD and cassette. The band considered \"What Was I Thinking\" to be their real first album, and the previous recordings to just be \"practice-runs\". In 1996, the band performed a Battle of the Bands show at the Electric Ballroom in Knoxville, TN in which Jeff Lysyczyn of Warner Bros. received a copy of the band's independent CD and a few months later talks began between the band and Warner Bros.\n\nIn 1997, Disciple signed with Warner Resound Records and on October 27, 1997, released its five-song EP, \"My Daddy Can Whip Your Daddy\" produced by Jeff Lysyczyn and Travis Wyrick. The band began touring non-stop in December 1997 and the band had their first No. 1 Rock Radio single on the Jamsline Rock Chart with the song \"Fill My Shoes\".\n\nIn 1998, Disciple signed with Rugged Records with whom they released their second full-length album, \"This Might Sting a Little\" on June 1, 1999. This album garnered them two GMA Dove Award nominations and two No. 1 Christian rock hit songs with \"I Just Know\" and \"Big Bad Wolf\". \"I Just Know\" was the most played song of 1999 on the Albuquerque, NM Christian radio station, KLYT, now known as Star 88.\n\nThe band released their third studio album, \"By God\", on February 6, 2001, which went on to win the Inspirational Life Award in 2001 and earned them two No. 1 Christian rock hits with the songs \"By God\" and \"God of Elijah\", and two Dove Awards nominations.\n\nThe band later released \"Back Again\" on February 25, 2003, on their own record label, Slain Records, which earned two No. 1 Christian rock hits with the songs \"Back Again\" and \"Wait\". Kevin Young agreed with the album being called the band's \"Back in Black\" album in a 2008 radio interview with The Full Armor of God Broadcast. In October 2003 Disciple added bassist Joey Fife to the trio.\n\nDisciple signed with INO Records and released their self-titled \"Disciple\" on June 7, 2005. This album featured three No. 1 Christian rock hits with the songs \"The Wait Is Over\", \"Into Black\", and \"Rise Up\", and two Dove Awards nominations. \"The Wait Is Over\" was the most-played Christian rock song of 2005.\nThey released \"Scars Remain\" on November 7, 2006. The song \"After the World\" was the eighth most played song on Christian Hit Radio stations in 2007 and was the band's first Christian CHR Radio No. 1 Hit. \"Scars Remain\", the album, has so far earned one Christian rock No. 1 with the song \"Love Hate (On and On)\" and two Dove Awards nominations. \"Scars Remain\" won the Dove Award for Rock Album of the Year, and was the band's first Dove Award win.\n\nOn January 8, 2008, Young announced in a \"Disciple: The Alliance\" email that Noah and Fife were stepping down as band members. However, Young said that Noah \"decided to still be a part of the songwriting process and even play on the recordings.\" He also mentioned that \"the songs that [Brad Noah] has been writing for the new Disciple project are somewhere between hard rock and southern rock.\" Also in that announcement was the addition of two new band members, Andrew Welch on guitar, and Israel Beachy on bass. With a new line-up, Disciple set off on the Cross the Line Tour with Superchick in March 2008. In April 2008, the band also announced the addition of Micah Sannan on guitar as well.\n\nThey released \"Southern Hospitality\" on October 21, 2008. \"Southern Hospitality\" earned the Dove Award nomination for Rock Album of the Year, and had a No. 1 Rock Hit with the song \"Romance Me\". Also in 2008, the band appeared on \"WWE The Music, Vol. 8\", providing the track \"In the Middle of It Now\" as the entrance theme for wrestlers Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder.\n\nOn April 28, 2010, Disciple announced a new album, \"Horseshoes and Hand Grenades\", on RadioU which was released on September 14. It was produced by Rob Hawkins, although the band re-recorded the album's lead single, \"Dear X (You Don't Own Me)\", with Howard Benson. They also revealed that they are accompanying Thousand Foot Krutch on their Welcome to the Masquerade tour, and afterwards tour with RED on their Nothing & Everything tour. They also had a tour with Ivoryline and Emery. They had their headline Rules of Engagement Tour with Project 86 and Write this Down in early 2011. Later, they joined Kutless and Newsboys on the Born Again Experience tour. They joined Skillet for their Awake and Alive Tour in late 2011. Trent Reiff officially joined the band on drums during the final stages of the Horsehoes and Handgrenades recordings sessions in early 2010 after the original drummer Tim Barrett's departure from the band.\n\n\"O God Save Us All\" was released on November 13, 2012, with Fair Trade Services (formerly INO Records) and was produced by Jasen Rauch, formerly of the band Red, with the first single, \"Draw the Line\", released on August 14 on iTunes. Lead guitarist Andrew Welch left the band in mid-September (Welch now plays for Thousand Foot Krutch. In November 2012 the band hosted a live video stream for the album release show in Nashville, Tennessee featuring Rich Ward of Stuck Mojo and Fozzy. Despite rumors of Ward joining Disciple full-time, Ward responded to a tweet asking if he was still with Disciple, \"No, I just played the album release show with them. I love those guys.\" Micah Sannan and Israel Beachy amicably left the band in December 2012, and were replaced by Josiah Prince, formerly of Philmont on guitar, and Jason Wilkes, former vocalist for High Flight Society, on bass guitar. Disciple did a co-Headlining tour with Fireflight in January and February 2013 called the Save Us Now Tour. Andrew Stanton, who is also currently in the band I Am Empire, began touring with the band in early 2013.\n\nIn early 2014, Disciple launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund their new album, which was to be recorded and released independently. The campaign was a huge success, setting a goal of $45,000 and ending with a total pledged amount of $115,852. For this project, the band returned to producer Travis Wyrick, who produced the first seven Disciple albums. The album, titled \"Attack\", was released on September 23 worldwide. This was Disciple's first album to feature members Josiah Prince, Jason Wilkes (former frontman of High Flight Society), Andrew Stanton, and Joey West (who refer to the current lineup as \"Disciple 3.0\"). The band went on to tour alongside Decyfer Down, Nine Lashes and Seventh Day Slumber on the City Rockfest tour of 2015.\n\nOn March 31, 2015, it was announced that Wilkes had made the decision to step down from the band in order to support his family. He left the band after the last show of the City Rockfest tour, on April 11, 2015.\n\nOn July 21, 2016, Disciple announced the release of a new live EP, called \"Live in Denmark\", which was made available for free digital download.\n\nOn August 3, 2016, Disciple launched a second Kickstarter campaign to fund their eleventh album, \"Long Live the Rebels\". The campaign ended on September 12, 2016, outperforming their previous Kickstarter with 2,012 people raising $127,675 for the album. The backers were given two brand new Disciple tracks immediately following called \"Erase\" and \"Underdog Fight Song.\" On September 23, 2016, it was announced that Disciple would be partnering with Tooth & Nail Records for the release of \"Long Live the Rebels\". The album was released on October 14, 2016.\n\nOn September 29, 2018, it was announced that guitarist Andrew Stanton had made the decision to step down from Disciple as a touring member to be at home for his family, though he would still be involved with the band in the future and contribute in writing and recording their next album. On December 5, 2018, it was announced that Disciple would be accepting auditions and looking for fill-in guitarists to perform live shows throughout 2019 following Stanton's departure. On December 8, 2018, Stanton played his final show as a full-time member.\n\nOn December 14, 2018, it was announced that Disciple had signed to Tooth & Nail Records for the release of their next upcoming album, \"Love Letter Kill Shot\", which was released on September 13, 2019.\n\nCurrent\n\nTouring\n\nFormer\n\nTimeline\n<div class=\"left\">\n\nThe song \"Game On\" was used for numerous television showings and commercials.

The Armory has a capacity of 4,300 for concerts and conventions and 3,600 for sports events.\n\nThe Armory was built in 1890 for the Tenth Battalion of the New York National Guard, designed by state architect Isaac Perry. Since the earliest years of professional and collegiate basketball, several college and minor league basketball teams have played in the Armory, as there was no other suitable facility for basketball in the Albany area for many years. The Armory also hosts boxing matches. For many years in the 1960s and 1970s the armory hosted the WWF (currently known as the WWE) wrestling association owned by the McMahon family. The Friday night cards were always a sellout.\n\nBetween 1982 and 1990, the Armory was home to the Albany Patroons of the Continental Basketball Association. After the Patroons moved to the then-new Knickerbocker Arena, the Armory fell into disuse and was the target of several reuse proposals including becoming the new home of the Albany Library System (whose main branch is next door to the Armory). The Armory was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 2, 1995.\n\nIn 2004, Albany Basketball & Sports Corporation bought the Armory and the renovated facility opened in September 2005, later that year becoming the home for a reincarnated Patroons. In 2006, the CBA Patroons were joined by the former Pennsylvania ValleyDawgs of the USBL though their first home game as the USBL Patroons did not take place until 2007. It also became home to the New York Buzz of World TeamTennis prior to their 2008 season.\n\nOn December 15, 2007 the Armory had to cancel a concert of the rock band Brand New because the roof began to cave in.\n\nThe Armory has of floor space, meeting facilities, and two video screens. Its website states that it will soon open an underground mall featuring stores and eateries.\n\nMichael Corts is the Armory's general manager. Former Albany County Executive James Coyne served as general manager from 2005 to 2009. Jay Baron replaced Jim Coyne.\n\n\n"}

According to folklore, it is deposited on the Earth during meteor showers. Star jelly is described as a translucent or grayish-white gelatin that tends to evaporate shortly after having \"fallen.\" Explanations have ranged from the materials being the remains of frogs, toads, or worms, to the byproducts of cyanobacteria, to the paranormal. Reports of the substance date back to the 14th century and have continued to the present day.\n\nThere have been reports of 'star-jelly' for centuries. John of Gaddesden (1280–1361), for example, mentions \"stella terrae\" (Latin for 'star of the earth' or 'earth-star') in his medical writings, describing it as \"a certain mucilaginous substance lying upon the earth\" and suggesting that it might be used to treat abscesses. A fourteenth-century Latin medical glossary has an entry for \"uligo\", described as \"a certain fatty substance emitted from the earth, that is commonly called 'a star which has fallen'\". Similarly, an English-Latin dictionary from around 1440 has an entry for \"sterre slyme\" with the Latin equivalent given as \"assub\" (a rendering of Arabic \"ash-shuhub\", also used in medieval Latin as a term for a \"falling\" or \"shooting\" star).\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary lists a large number of other names for the substance, with references dating back to the circa-1440 English-Latin dictionary entry mentioned above: star-fallen, star-falling, star-jelly, star-shot, star-slime, star-slough, star-slubber, and star-slutch.\n\nThe slime mold \"Enteridium lycoperdon\" is called \"caca de luna\" (moon's excrement) by the locals in the state of Veracruz in Mexico.\n\nA long article in the paranormal magazine \"Fate\" declared star jelly to be of extraterrestrial origin, calling it \"cellular organic matter\" which exists as \"prestellar molecular clouds\" which float through space.\n\nIn \"The Book of British Amphibians and Reptiles\" (page 138), author M. Smith states that star jelly is most likely formed from the glands in the oviducts of frogs and toads. Birds and mammals will eat the animals but not the oviducts which, when they come into contact with moisture, swell and distort leaving a vast pile of jellylike substance sometimes also referred to as otter jelly.\n\nIn 1910, T. Mckenny Hughes ruminated in \"Nature\" as to why meteors were associated with star jelly by poets and ancient writers, and observed that the jelly seemed to \"grow out from among the roots of grass\".\n\n\n\n\n<poem>As he whose quicker eye doth trace\nA false star shot to a mark'd place\nDo's run apace,\nAnd, thinking it to catch,\nA jelly up do snatch</poem>\n\nThat the Starres eat...that those falling Starres, as some call them, which are found on the earth in the form of a trembling gelly, are their excrement.\n\nWhen I had taken up what I supposed a fallen star I found I had been cozened with a jelly.\n\n<poem>Swift as the shooting star, that gilds the night\nWith rapid transient Blaze, she runs, she flies;\nSudden she stops nor longer can endure\nThe painful course, but drooping sinks away,\nAnd like that falling Meteor, there she lyes\nA jelly cold on earth.</poem>\n\nSir Walter Scott, in his novel \"The Talisman\", wrote:\n\"Seek a fallen star,\" said the hermit, \"and thou shalt only light on some foul jelly, which, in shooting through the horizon, has assumed for a moment an appearance of splendour.\"\n\nAn unidentifiable substance that falls to earth during a meteor-type event forms the background to \"The Colour Out of Space\", a 1927 short story by the American horror and science fiction author H. P. Lovecraft.\n\nSome observers have made a connection between star jelly and the Paramount movie \"The Blob\", in which a gelatinous monster slime falls from space. \"The Blob\", which was released in 1958, was supposedly based on the Philadelphia reports from 1950 and specifically a report in the \"Philadelphia Inquirer\" called \"Flying 'Saucer' Just Dissolves\" where four police officers encountered a UFO debris that was described as evaporating with a purple glow leaving nothing. Paramount Pictures was also sued for this movie by the author Joseph Payne Brennan, who had written a short story published in \"Weird Tales Magazine\" in 1953 called \"Slime\" about a similar creature.\n\nIn the 1978 film \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\", the alien spores that fall to Earth in a rain shower form blobs of jelly that grow into flowers which produce the seed pods.\n\nIn the 2011 novel \"The Isle of Blood\" by Rick Yancey, star jelly (referred to as \"Pwdre Ser\" in the story) is the saliva of a monster called \"Magnificum\" that falls to earth along with blood and shredded human remains, sometimes weaved into a nest or bowl of sorts, known as a \"nidus\". Anyone who comes in contact with Pwdre Ser becomes \"infected\", and will slowly decline in health until they are literally a living corpse.\n\nMary-Ann Constantine's 2016 novel, Star-Shot, is named after another word for the phenomenon, and features a character taking a sample to be analysed.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1896801", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896801", "title": "The Varsity Club", "text": "The Varsity Club\n\nThe Varsity Club was a professional wrestling heel stable in the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions and World Championship Wrestling (WCW). The stable was formed in 1987 and lasted until 1989. The stable was briefly resurrected in 1999–2000.\n\nThe Varsity Club formed in the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions by Kevin Sullivan after he recruited Rick Steiner who was of University of Michigan's and Syracuse University's Mike Rotunda in early 1988. The group would wear the letterman jackets of their respective alma maters and brag about their superiority to other wrestlers on the roster because of their amateur wrestling background. In Rotunda and Steiner's case their claims were legitimate, as they both wrestled in college, while Sullivan's claims were more a matter of Kayfabe. Rotunda was the Florida Champion, but when he defeated Nikita Koloff (with Kevin Sullivan's help) to win the NWA World Television Championship, he gave the Florida title to Steiner. The team seemed cohesive initially under Sullivan's leadership, but began to experience dissension as Rotunda and Steiner bickered over who was the “Captain” of the team.\nIn February 1988, the Club started a feud with Jimmy Garvin because Sullivan wanted Garvin's valet Precious. Sullivan would stalk Precious and taunt her with papers in his robe, but it was never revealed why he was stalking her or what the papers were about. Garvin got help from his \"brother\" ”Rugged” Ron Garvin and \"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams in his fight with the Club. At Clash of the Champions I Rotunda defeated Jimmy Garvin in a “College Rules” match. Three months later Garvin got revenge as he and Ron defeated Rotunda and Steiner at Clash of the Champions II. The fact that it was Steiner who lost the match was further cause for friction in the Club. Sullivan and Rotunda started to punish the “slow witted” Steiner (in character) and taunted him mercilessly. At The Great American Bash 1988 the Garvins/Varsity Club feud came to a violent clash as the Garvins teamed with the Road Warriors and Steve Williams to beat Sullivan, Rotunda, Al Perez, The Russian Assassin and Ivan Koloff in a Tower of Doom Match. In September 1988 the Club attacked Jimmy Garvin; Sullivan used a cinder block to “break” Garvin's leg, effectively ending the feud. Steiner began a slow face turn when he tried to save Sting from a beatdown by The Road Warriors, who turned on him after a match against the Club.\n\nSteiner finally reached his breaking point near the end of 1988, when he attacked Rotunda, turning face as a sympathetic underdog. At Starrcade 1988 he received a match with Rotunda for the TV title. Despite being locked in a cage at ringside, Sullivan had an ace up his sleeve. The ace was former opponent Steve Williams, a University of Oklahoma alumnus who had just joined the Varsity Club. Though Williams was unable to prevent Steiner from winning the TV title, his arrival signified a major recruiting coup for Sullivan. Earlier in the night, Sullivan and Williams brought gold back to the stable when they defeated the Fantastics for the United States Tag-Team titles. Steiner's run with the TV title ended a few months later as Rotundo regained the belt at the Chi-Town Rumble on February 20, 1989. He did get impressive backup from his brother Scott, a recent arrival who was eager to help. Though Scott's role was initially limited to moral support, he and Rick would later go on to become one of the most accomplished tag team in the promotion's history. The Steiners celebrated when Rick and \"Hot Stuff\" Eddie Gilbert won the US Tag-Team titles from Williams and Sullivan on February 28.\n\nIn early 1989, the group added University of Georgia alumnus Dan Spivey to their ranks in an effort to dominate the promotion. This was an attempt to fill a power vacuum created by the disbanding of The Four Horsemen. The effort got off to a rocky start when Rotunda lost the TV Title to Sting. on March 31, 1989.\n\nThroughout the spring of 1989, the Club made several attempts to dethrone reigning NWA World Tag Team Champions the Road Warriors, including Sullivan and Williams' match with them at the Chi-Town Rumble. On April 2, 1989 at Clash of the Champions VI the combination of Williams and Rotunda were able to defeat the Warriors, thanks to a fast count by referee Teddy Long., who had been bribed by Sullivan. The duo managed to keep the titles through Sullivan's outside interference and frequent disqualifications, including at their title defense at WrestleWar 1989. However, due to the controversial way the Club won and defended the titles, they were stripped of the gold that night.\n\nThe Club was unable to regain the US Tag titles from Rick Steiner and Eddie Gilbert, although they did force Gilbert to leave the promotion for a short time. Gilbert's departure provided the impetus for Rick to team with his brother Scott, a pairing that would go on to become very successful in the coming years. Shortly after WrestleWar 1989, the club began to disintegrate with the departures of Williams and later Spivey, who started to work with Sid Vicious as one of The Skyscrapers. This left Sullivan and Rotunda as the sole Varsity Club members, meaning the stable was effectively finished. The Steiner Brothers made their team debut at the Great American Bash 1989, beating Sullivan and Rotunda in a Texas Tornado Match. The last official appearance of the Club occurred when former member Williams defeated Rotunda at Clash of the Champions VIII. Rotunda would later turn face in 1990, becoming \"Captain Mike Rotunda,\" and he would form a crew with Abdullah the Butcher and Norman the Lunatic to feud with a group formed by former Varsity Club teammate Kevin Sullivan, known as \"Sullivan's Slaughterhouse,\" composed of Cactus Jack, Buzz Sawyer, and Bam Bam Bigelow, with barely any mention being made of Rotunda's and Sullivan's past association during the feud. Rotunda and Steiner would later feud briefly in the World Wrestling Federation, with Rotunda now playing a tax man named Irwin R. Schyster, who teamed with Ted DiBiase to form Money Incorporated. Money Inc. would lose the WWF Tag Team Championship to Rick and his brother, Scott Steiner, twice.\n\nThe Varsity Club had a brief reformation in WCW in 1999 when Sullivan, Rotunda and Steiner teamed together at Starrcade on December 19, 1999. The three men were ”Hacksaw” Jim Duggan’s surprise partners, showing up in their old letterman jackets and accompanied by a cheerleader, Leia Meow; they made her do pushups and bounce on a trampoline at ringside. The Club turned on Duggan at the end of the match, leaving him easy prey for The Revolution. The Club disbanded in late January 2000 after a brief feud with Don and Ron Harris.\n\nIn September 2000, Williams and Rotunda reformed their team, under the name Varsity Club 2000, in All Japan Pro Wrestling. Williams had been a regular in AJPW since the original stable's break up and Rotunda started touring after leaving WCW. Despite winning the promotion's annual World's Strongest Tag Determination League tournament in December, they were never able to enjoy much success due to Rotunda's injuries and the phasing out of foreign talent left from the All Japan promotional system before the Pro Wrestling Noah split.\n\n\n"}

Clark, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Duggan's close associate journalist Edward R. Murrow, among others. However, in the 1990s, evidence from decrypted Soviet telegrams revealed that he was an active Soviet spy for the KGB in the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nLaurence Hayden Duggan was born on May 28, 1905, in New York City. His father, Stephen P. Duggan, was a professor of Political Science at the City College of New York before founding the Institute of International Education. His mother Sarah Alice Elsesser was a director of the \"Negro Welfare League\" of White Plains, New York.\n\nDuggan received early education at the Roger Ascham School in Hartsdale, New York, and White Plains Community Church, where he learned simplicity, courtesy, and democracy. In 1923, he graduate \"cum laude\" from the Phillips Exeter Academy. In 1927, he graduated with distinction from Harvard University. (Ware Group members such as Alger Hiss and Lee Pressman were 1929 graduates of Harvard Law School.) In 1930, when he joined State, he took postgraduate courses in history, government, and economics at the George Washington University.\n\nIn 1927, Duggan began his career by working for Harper Brothers publishers. By 1929, his father, then director of the Institute of International Education, created a bureau for Latin America and offered the position to his son. Duggan accepted, learned Spanish and Portuguese, and toured the region to become better acquainted with it. By 1930, he had produced a report that reached Charles Howland, head of studies in international relations at Yale University. Howland forwarded the report to Dana Munro, chief of the Latin American Division, who offered Duggan a position.\n\nIn 1930, Duggan moved to Washington, DC, to join the U.S. Department of State—nine of those years as head of the Latin American Division and four as adviser on political relations. (His Harvard friend Noel Field had joined State in the late 1920s.) Duggan served as Secretary of State Cordell Hull's at major conference in Lima, Peru and Havana, Cuba. Positions he held included Chief of the Division of the American Republics as well as Political Adviser and Director of the Office of the American Republics.\n\nIn 1944, Duggan returned briefly to the private sector, when he served as consultant on Latin American affairs–a \"profitable business.\"\n\nShortly thereafter, Herbert H. Lehman (New York governor) and Dr. Eduardo Santos (former president of Colombia, asked Duggan to serve the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) for six months. (In 1936, his friend Noel Field had taken a position for the U.S. with the League of Nations and then in 1941 become director of the American Unitarian Universalist Service Committee's relief mission in Marseilles.)\n\nIn 1946, a committee of the IIE (comprising Virginia Gildersleeve of Barnard College, Edward R. Murrow of CBS News, Waldo Leland of the Carnegie Institute, and Arthur W. Packard of Rockefeller Brothers Fund) offered Duggan the presidency of the Institute of International Education (IIE) upon his father's retirement. The IIE provided for a flow of exchange students between the United States and several other countries.\n\nOn November 1, 1946, Duggan began as IIE president. One of his first actions was to make the board more inclusive by adding women, union representatives (\"labor men\"), and African-Americans including Benjamin Mays of Morehouse College (a mentor of Martin Luther King, Jr.). He expanded students to include trainees, entrepreneurs, labor leaders, professionals, artists, and musicians. U.S. President Truman appointed Duggan to the ten-member administrators of the Fulbright Act. He provided advice during the establishment of UNESCO. In 1947, he served as a member of the U.S. delegation to the second session of the UNESCO general conference, held in Mexico City.\n\nDuring his two years as president, IIE's funding increased its budget nearly 400% from $109,000 to $430,000. Funding from the Carnegie Corporation alone increased $50,000 per year during that time (and Alger Hiss became president of sister organization, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace within days of Duggan's appointment to the IIE).\n\nDuggan was a close friend of Noel Field of the State Department. The GRU had also tried to recruit him through Frederick Field.\n\nIn the mid-1930s, Duggan was recruited by Hede Massing as a Soviet spy. Duggan told the FBI that Henry Collins of the Ware group had also tried unsuccessfully to recruit him to the NKVD. \n\nPeter Gutzeit, the Soviet Consul in New York City, was also an officer in the NKVD. In 1934 he identified Laurence Duggan as a potential recruit. Boris Bazarov told Hede Massing that they wanted her to help recruit Duggan and Noel Field. The plan, suggested by Gutzeit, was to use Duggan to draw Field into the network. Gutzeit wrote on 3 October 1934, that Duggan \"is interesting us because through him one will be able to find a way toward Noel Field... of the State Department's European Department with whom Duggan is friendly.\" \n\nDuggan provided Soviet intelligence with confidential diplomatic cables, including from American Ambassador William Bullitt. He was a source for the Soviets until he resigned from the State Department in 1944.\n\nAccording to Whittaker Chambers in his 1952 memoir, Egmont Gaines proposed covert group, \"insisting\" the group approach Duggan, \"whom he called 'very sympathetic'.\" Duggan was then in the State Department, and became chief of its Latin-American Division. According to Boris Bazarov, Duggan told his Soviet handlers, he only remained \"at his hateful job in the State Department\" because he was \"useful for our cause.\"\n\nIn 1932, Duggan married Helen Boyd, a Vassar College graduate. They had four children: Stephanie, Laurence Jr., Robert, and Christoper.\n\nOn December 20, 1948, Duggan fell to his death from his office at the Institute of International Education, located on the 16th floor of a building in midtown Manhattan. His body was discovered around 7:00 PM that evening. A few days later, the New York Police Department made public the result of its investigation, which concluded: \"Mr. Duggan either accidentally fell or jumped.\"\n\nDuring his last four days, he spoke with his father about funding for the IIE, his mother about Christmas, with Dr. Santos at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel about US-Latin American relations, and on December 20 itself with Pierre Bédard, director of the French Institute, about inviting a distinguished French national to lecture in the United States under IIE auspices.\n\nFriends published a memorial book about Duggan, with contributions made directly to the book or gleaned from the press by: Eleanor Roosevelt, Tom C. Clark, Sumner Welles, Marquis Childs (friend), Edward R. Murrow, Roscoe Drummond, and Raymond Moley, Joseph Harsh, Elmer Davis, Martin Agronsky, Henry R. Luce, Clarence Pickett, and Harry Emerson Fosdick. Archibald MacLeish composed a memorial poem, published in the \"New York Herald Tribune\"\n\nOn December 21, 1948, at 7:45 PM (barely 24 hours after Duggan's death), Murrow broadcast on CBS radio: Tonight, the headlines are shouting: \"Duggan Named in Spy Case.\" Who named him? Isaac Don Levine, who said he was quoting Whittaker Chambers. And who denies it? Whittaker Chambers. Tonight, Representative Mundt says: \"The Duggan affair is a close book so far as the House Committee is concerned.\" The Representative from South Dakota also says he is thinking of making recommendations for changing the procedure at committee hearings, maybe even giving the accused person the right to be heard before the Committee issues a report. <br> The members of the Committee who have done this thing upon such slight and wholly discredited testimony may now consult their actions and their consciences.\n\nOn October 20, 1948, W. Marvin Smith, a U.S. Department of Justice attorney and notary with whom Alger Hiss had worked, was found dead in the southwest stairwell of the (then) seven-story Justice building. Just after Laurence Duggan's death, the Associated Press reported: The widow of W. Marvin Smith, justice department employee who died in a five story plunge 2 months ago, expressed belief today that his death was simply an accident.<br>She told a reporter she feels certain it was not a suicide and was not connected in any way with his appearance as a minor witness in congressional hearings. Smith's death had been recalled in some newspaper accounts of the death of Laurence Duggan in New York City.<br>On Oct. 20, Smith hurtled to his death down circular stairwell in the justice department. That was also the opinion of justice officials.<br>Smith, 53, was an attorney in the solicitor general's office. Last summer, he figure in a minor way in the house committee on un-American activities. In 1951, the \"Chicago Tribune\" newspaper speculated about \"several suicides and mysterious deaths\" among spies and government officials mostly related to the Hiss Case, including: \n\n\nThe Venona project succeeded in decrypting some Soviet intelligence cables that had been intercepted in the mid-1940s. The code name used for Laurence Duggan in the decrypted transcripts is \"Frank\" and \"19\". He is referenced in the following Venona decryptions, which provided information to the Soviets about Anglo-American plans for invading Italy during World War II:\n\n\n\n"}
