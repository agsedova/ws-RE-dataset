{"id": "2147624", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2147624", "title": "Edmondo Rossoni", "text": "Edmondo Rossoni\n\nEdmondo Rossoni (May 6, 1884 – June 8, 1965) was a revolutionary syndicalist leader and an Italian fascist politician who became involved in the Fascist syndicate movement during Benito Mussolini's regime.\n\nBorn to a working-class family in Tresigallo, a small town in the Province of Ferrara, Rossoni was imprisoned in 1908 for his revolutionary activities as a syndicalist. After leaving Italy in 1910 and arriving in the United States, Rossoni began to work with Big Bill Haywood as an organizer for the Industrial Workers of the World union (IWW), and edited the revolutionary syndicalist newspaper \"Il Proletario\" (\"The Proletarian\"), which by1912 was the Italian-language newspaper of the IWW. In 1911 Rossoni gained some notoriety in the United States after he spat on an Italian flag at a New York demonstration. Seeing how poorly Italian immigrant workers were treated in the United States by capitalists and other revolutionary cadre, he returned to Italy at the outbreak of World War I with the purpose of “fusing nationalism with class struggle,” and volunteered for military service in the war.\n\nDetermined to merge socialism with nationalism, Rossoni joined Benito Mussolini's Fascist movement in 1921. After the March on Rome, he continued his political activities and became a major political force in Mussolini's administration until 1943.\n\nAlong with Alfredo Rocco and Giuseppe Bottai, Rossoni is considered to have played a large role in the development of Italy's Fascist State. His program of \"corporativismo integrale\" was seen as a \"cosmetically altered version of \"sindacalismo integrale\"\" that was to assist in the transformation of Italy into a \"Fascist syndicate\" state. Regarded as one of the founders of “Fascist syndicalism”, Rossoni had learned in the United States to distrust both the capitalists and various orthodox socialist movements that urged internationalism, recalling his conversion to social nationalism at the first congress of Fascist unions in June 1922:\n\nWe have seen our workers exploited and held in low regard not only by the capitalists but also by the revolutionary \"comrades\" of other countries. We therefore know from experience how internationalism is nothing but fiction and hypocrisy.”\n\nOne of Rossoni’s first syndicalist ventures in Italy was helping to found the \"Unione Italiana del Lavoro\" (UIL) in June 1918. With some support of Mussolini’s Fascist Revolutionary Party, he led the occupation of the \"Franchi e Gregorini\" steelworks plant in Dalmine in March 1919 under the tricolor Italian flag in contrast to the red flag.\n\nConsidered a firebrand on labor and corporatist issues, Rossoni became the secretary-general of the Confederation of National Syndicates in January 1922, which went through a series of merges and negotiations and ended up renamed the General Confederation of Fascist Syndical Corporations by December 1922. He also helped launch a Fascist trade union journal in March 1922, \"Il lavoro d’Italia\", which was renamed \"Il lavoro fascista\" in the wake of Rossoni’s reorganization of the fascist syndicate movement in 1928.\n\nWith state backing, Rossoni greatly expanded membership in the Fascist Syndicate, where membership rose from 250,000 to 1.8 million between 1920 and 1924, surpassing every other labor organization. By 1924 Rossoni’s Fascist Syndicate had even more members than the National Fascist Party, which claimed only 650,000 members. The high numbers of members alarmed Fascist party leaders who were determined to keep Rossoni’s power somehow checked.\n\nSeeking to control the revolutionary direction of Fascist movement, Rossoni made it clear that Fascist syndicalism should be at the forefront, proclaiming in Mussolini’s \"Il Popolo d'Italia\" newspaper that “only the Fascist syndicates could complete the revolution.”. Considering as partisans of “left fascism,” Rossoni and his cadre of Fascist Syndicates sought “labor’s autonomy and class consciousness.” Such advocacy worried industrialists and the business community, particularly Rossoni’s interpretation of Marx’s “dynamic law of history,” which induced him to advocate eventual workers’ control of factories. He took the position that “industrialists had the right to occupy their positions only till such time as workers, organized into new syndicates, had mastered the requisite competence to take command.” In early 1922, Rossoni claimed that capitalism “depressed and annulled production rather than stimulating and developing it” and that industrialists were “apathetic, passive, and ignorant.”\n\nMany Fascist trade union leaders, including Rossoni, “had dedicated their lives to class struggle,” and were increasingly looked upon with consternation by industrialists and the Confindustria (Italian employers' federation and national chamber of commerce).\n\nBy April 1923, the conflict between industrialists and Rossoni’s Fascist syndicates had become so contentious that a circle of industrialists questioned themselves on whether it was “now wise to pay the Communists to fight the Fascists!” A month later, the future Italian Communist leader Palmiro Togliatti wrote a letter to Moscow, informing them that the \"industrial classes are rather wary of the new regime, fearing unpredictable developments in the class struggle with Fascist syndicates.\" As the hostilities continued, Rossoni by 1926 was referring to the industrialists as \"vampires\" and \"profiteers.\"\n\nFor Rossoni, fascism was nothing less than \"The great revolution of the twentieth Century: a revolution which in its subsequent development will be nourished by the immortal spirit of the Italian people,…” \n\nTo display their solidarity for workers, Rossoni and Roberto Farinacci initially supported the metallurgical workers' strikes in Brescia in March 1925 in an attempt to get higher wages and union recognition. The Fascist syndicalists determined that they had to become more militant to gain more working-class support since workers still had the right to select union representation. But such tactics often failed, forcing the Fascist syndicalists to depend more and more on state authority to advance a monopoly of labor representation. Such a monopoly was finally institutionalized under Alfredo Rocco's syndical law of April 3, 1926 that \"legally authorized the fascist syndicates' monopoly over worker representation.\" The Fascist syndicates became the sole representatives of labor.\n\nDespite conflicts with other Fascist leaders, Rossoni admonished that “without the action of Fascism, which has broken the hegemony of the reds and whites, our union movement would not exist.”\n\nResenting Rossoni’s autonomous role in controlling the Fascist syndicates, the General Confederation of Industry decided to dismantle the National Confederation of Fascist Syndicates on November 1928, claiming that his syndicates had failed to “educate the masses.” His confederation was broken up and reorganized into six smaller syndicates that were arranged by economic sectors. Other historians have suggested that Fascist party leaders were attempting to clip Rossoni’s power base since his fascist syndicate sought “concrete provisions on labor contracts, minimum salaries, working hours and terms for employment,” positions that employers were usually unwilling to accept.\n\nDespite being forced to resign from the leadership of the General Confederation of Fascist Syndical Corporations, Rossoni continued to serve in Mussolini’s administration in a number of capacities; a member of the Fascist Grand Council, 1930–43, undersecretary of state, 1932–35, and minister of agriculture and forestry 1935–39. In his capacity as minister of agriculture and forestry, Rossoni ordered the replanning and reconstruction of his native town of Tresigallo along rationalist lines, intending to transform it into a \"new town\" of Italy.\n\nRossoni made himself famous on July 25, 1943, by voting against Mussolini's leadership inside the Grand Council (thus siding with the coup d'état initiated by Dino Grandi). When Mussolini regained power in northern Italy, creating the Italian Social Republic, Rossoni was sentenced to death in absentia. After escaping to Canada, he returned to Italy in 1947 when his sentence had been commuted to life imprisonment. For years, he lived in the resort town of Viareggio.\n\n"}

His father was murdered in 605.\n\nSa'id had over thirty children by at least eleven different women.\n\nSa'id is described as a tall, hairy, dark-skinned man.\n\nSa'id became a Muslim not later than 614.\n\nHis wife Fatima was also an early convert. At first they kept their faith secret because Fatima's brother Umar was a prominent persecutor of Muslims. Khabbab ibn al-Aratt often visited their house and read the Qur'an to Fatima.\n\nOne day Umar entered their house while Khabbab was reading and demanded to know what the \"balderdash\" was. When they denied that anything had been read, Umar seized Sa'id and knocked him to the floor. Fatima stood up to defend her husband, and Umar hit her so hard that she bled. The couple admitted that they were Muslims. At the sight of the blood, Umar was sorry for what he had done, and asked to see what they had been reading. It was \"Ta-Ha\", later to become the twentieth \"Surah\" of the Qur'an. Impressed by the beauty of the words, Umar decided to become a Muslim.\n\nSa'id joined the general emigration to Medina in 622 and at first lodged in the house of Rifa'a ibn Abdul-Mundhir. He was made the brother in Islam of Rafi ibn Malik of the Zurayq clan; but an alternative tradition names his brother in Islam as Talha ibn Ubaydallah.\n\nSa'id and Talha missed the Battle of Badr because Muhammad sent them ahead as scouts to report on the movements of Abu Sufyan's caravan. When they heard that they had missed the caravan, they returned to Medina, only to find that Muhammad and his army had already reached Badr. They set out for Badr and met the returning victorious army at Turban. However, Muhammad gave them a share of the \"Maal e Ganimat\" (spoils of war) as if they had been present.\n\nSa'id participated in all the other battles in which Muhammad personally fought.\n\nHe served as Muhammad's secretary and recorded the verses of the Quran.\n\nOnce he was appointed Governor of Damascus without his consent. He wrote to Abu ‘Ubayda, \"I am unable to offer such a sacrifice. You will perform Jihad while I will be deprived of it. Please send someone else to replace me as soon as you receive this letter. I am coming to you soon.\" Later, he fought as an ordinary soldier in all the battles of the Islamic army.\n\nIn the time of Muawiyah I he was Governor of Kufa.\n\nHe died in 671 AD (51 AH) during the reign of Muawiyah I at al-Aqiq. His body was carried back to Medina and buried there by Sa`d ibn Abi Waqqas and Abdullah ibn Umar.\n\nSa'id said that Muhammad once guaranteed Paradise to ten men who were then present and named nine of them. Then he hinted that the tenth man had been himself. This story of the Ten Promised Paradise was corroborated by another of the Ten, 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf.\n\n\n"}

It originally aired on December 4, 2002 and is rated TV-MA in the United States.\n\nIn the episode, a man claiming to be Stan's future self shows up to his house. Stan's future self is an unemployed drug addict, but Stan suspects that it is a hoax put on by his parents, while South Park's own little entrepreneur, Eric Cartman, is at the helm of a new money-making venture, and Cartman is in the business of revenge.\n\nThe children have found a joint that has been left behind by the highschoolers. They are afraid, because according to commercials you die when you touch it and marijuana causes terrorism. Stan is not afraid and throws away the joint.\n\nThat night, in the middle of a thunderstorm, a man claiming to be an older version of Stan appears at the Marsh family's door. This future Stan has spent time in juvenile hall, used large amounts of drugs and alcohol, which Stan decides must have begun when he first touched the marijuana cigarette. He is convinced that the only way to safeguard his future is for his present self to avoid drugs and alcohol, do well in school, and stay motivated in life. Stan even asks Butters to tutor him. While the two boys are talking, Stan discovers that Butters also has a slovenly \"Future Self\" living with him.\n\nStan finds the whole situation suspicious, and the two find an employee card in the \"future\" Stan's personal effects labelled \"Motivation Corp.\" leading them to finding out it is where parents hire actors to pose as their children's future self to make them avoid drugs and alcohol. Stan is appalled at the way these parents have all deceived their children and he and Butters decide to look in the phone book to find a place to run away to. However, they discover a \"Parental Revenge Center\" hotline with guaranteed results, which is run by Cartman who agrees to help the two. However, Cartman's revenge plan for both boys involves going to both of their houses to smear all of the walls with feces. Butters is delighted by this offer and gladly accepts it, while Stan believes that it isn't adequate payback. Cartman then tries to convince Stan by taking it up a notch and offering to kill his parents and slice them into pieces. Stan refuses this offer as well, and decides to worm the truth out of his parents himself in order to force them to acknowledge that they lied to him.\n\nStan tries to get the truth out of his parents by pretending to cut off his own hand so that his future self's hand would also come off as a way of seeing if he really is Stan's future self, but Randy improvises by deliberately cutting off the actor's hand after doing so. Though Stan reveals that he didn't actually cut his hand off at all, Randy ends up pretending that the actor's hand has never been cut off while trying to attach it back on him, causing Stan to storm out of his home in frustration. Meanwhile, the Parental Revenge Agency does its job at Butters' house as Cartman and a group of Hispanic day workers smear feces all over the living room and bedroom of the Stotch household. Upon returning home, Chris and Linda actually acknowledge that they deserve it for lying and finally tell the truth about the \"future self\" thing and apologize to Butters.\n\nRandy and Sharon Marsh arrive and continue blatantly lying to Stan, insisting that more future selves must be coming back in time to the present, which finally causes Stan to snap and tell them that he knows all about Motivation Corp., and that he was trying to get them to admit they lied to him. Randy and Sharon come to the realization that if they just keep lying to him, he might not ever trust them again; Randy finally apologizes to Stan and gives him the whole truth about drug abuse, saying that it probably won't kill him or fund terrorism but still may ruin his future. Stan adds he really wishes they had just told him that in the first place instead of lying to him. The Stotches and Marshes then all agree that what Motivation Corp. does is wrong, and hires Cartman to smear their walls with feces. At that point, Stan thanks Cartman, saying that he really came through.\n\nCartman says that the whole experience has taught him that he should think about his own future and start taking better care of himself. Moments later, a thin and handsome man, claiming to be Cartman's future self, shows up and tells Cartman that this was the turning point in his life. From this day forward, he turns his life around, and will become the famous CEO of a time-traveling company. Cartman is not convinced, believing it to be yet another Motivation Corp. actor and immediately changes his mind, vowing to do \"whatever I want!\" from then on, which includes eating unhealthy and doing drugs. As it turns out, the man really is Cartman's future self and immediately changes into a dirty, morbidly obese mechanic. Future Cartman then exclaims, \"Oh, goddamn it!\"\n\nThe episode delivers a direct anti-drug message while simultaneously poking fun at all the anti-drug commercials and propaganda that were airing during most teen and young adult oriented television blocks at the time (specifically, the dubious claims many were making about the consequences of marijuana use). In the DVD commentary, Parker and Stone stated that they were inspired to do the episode after seeing an advertisement by The Partnership For A Drug-Free America which linked marijuana use to terrorism. Parker stated that they had originally intended for the episode to include a spoof of the commercial but decided against it when they could not think of anything more ridiculous than saying, \"If you smoke pot, you become a terrorist\".\n\nButters' \"Future Self\" only watches \"Becker\", a series the young Butters finds \"stupid\".\n\n\"My Future Self 'n' Me\", along with the sixteen other episodes from \"South Park\"'s sixth season, were released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on October 11, 2005. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode. IGN gave the season a rating of 9/10.\n\n"}

In June 1830, the hospital tent was re-erected in Cathedral Avenue, Perth. From 1833 a more substantial colonial hospital operated for a short time from a rented room in a private house. Six years later, in December 1840, this was re-opened in a building formerly used as stables on the corner of St Georges Terrace and Irwin Street. The hospital commenced operations on the corner of Murray Street and Victoria Square on 14 July 1855, and was formally named the Colonial Hospital. In the years since, it has expanded north to Wellington Street. It has been known variously as the Perth Public Hospital, the Perth Hospital and finally, from 1946, as Royal Perth Hospital.\n\nInitial plans in 2005 were to close down operations at RPH in response to the opening of Fiona Stanley Hospital; however, the Western Australian government's South Metropolitan Services have changed plans since. The main campus on Wellington Street will retain its role as a major adult trauma centre and centre for complex surgeries. The Shenton Park campus (a tertiary rehabilitation centre) has closed down and rehabilitation services moved to Fiona Stanley Hospital.\n\nRoyal Perth Hospital employs over 6000 people and sees over 70,000 patients each year. Some of the services offered are imaging, trauma and neurosciences, a wide variety of surgical options, critical and emergency care, dermatology, internal medicine, and haematology.\n\nAs well as providing a comprehensive array of medical services for adults, Royal Perth exists as a teaching hospital, having close associations with Western Australia's four major universities and TAFE institutions. This allows tertiary institutions to provide practical, professional education opportunities and ensures Royal Perth has well-trained and capable staff.\n\nRoyal Perth also fosters relationships with WA's other hospitals, including Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Fiona Stanley Hospital and Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, ensuring all services are available to inpatients, even if RPH doesn't provide them itself.\n\nThe head of research at Royal Perth Hospital is Professor Peter Leedman, and RPH is a leading researcher into both patient recovery and improvements in staff practices. RPH shares its campus with several other major research foundations, including the Western Australian Institute for Medical Research, ensuring several research projects are taking place at any one time.\nThe high standing of RPH researchers is demonstrated by their significant contribution to the annals of international scientific literature each year. In 1998, a total of 158 articles and 114 abstracts were published in refereed medical, nursing and scientific journals. In addition, staff presented a total of 190 papers at national and international professional conferences.\n\nThe Royal Perth Rehabilitation Hospital was first established as an isolation tent hospital in the bush at Shenton Park during the outbreak of smallpox in April 1893. This hospital, variously known as the Isolation Hospital, the Victoria Hospital, the Infectious Diseases Branch and finally as the Royal Perth Rehabilitation Hospital, commenced its role as a major rehabilitation hospital with the rehabilitation of polio patients following the epidemic of 1948-56.\n\nSeveral well-known practitioners and medical researchers have worked at Royal Perth Hospital over the years, including Dr Fiona Wood, winner of the 2005 Australian of the Year Award, and Professor Barry Marshall and Dr Robin Warren, winners of the 2005 Nobel Prize in Physiology.\n\nThe Royal Perth Hospital motto is \"Servio\". The hospital logo is based on the arms of the City of Perth and was first introduced in 1935. It comprises the St George's Cross on a white shield with a black swan in the top left canton and a banner inscribed with the word \"Servio\".\n\nVarious RPH buildings are listed on the State Register of Heritage Places.\n\n\n"}

As a teenager, Vinson trained and competed at a national level in swimming, holding a total of four state records throughout high school. Vinson began singing, dancing and acting at a young age, becoming the third generation in her family of performers. In 1945 Vinson's grandmother was the youngest ballerina to be offered a scholarship in the Brovansky Ballet Company in England. At the age of twelve, Vinson enrolled as a student at the Brent Street School of Performing Arts in Sydney.\n\nVinson's introduction into the entertainment industry was initially as a musician, before a transition to acting. At seventeen years old, Vinson and three other girls were grouped together in a Pop/R&B girl group, Foxfire IV. The group's first and only single to date, \"Roses\", failed to make an impact and the group disbanded shortly after.\n\nFollowing her short-lived stint with Foxfire IV, Vinson made her acting debut portraying minor characters in two episodes of the Australian soap opera \"Home and Away\" in both 2001 and 2003. Vinson left an impression on the \"Home and Away\" casting agent, who subsequently requested her for a regular role on the series. Vinson initially auditioned for the role of Martha MacKenzie, but lost out on the part to fellow cast member at the time Jodi Gordon. Vinson instead portrayed the role of Cassie Turner, a troubled teenager who is taken into foster care after numerous run-ins with the police. Vinson quickly proved popular with the show's audience, receiving a nomination for \"Most Popular New Female Talent\" for her portrayal of Cassie Turner at the Logie Awards of 2006. In July 2007, speculation arose that Vinson intended to leave the series in order to pursue an acting career in Los Angeles.

After initially ultimately joining her boyfriend's dance crew and helping them to victory over the crew of her under-handed and immoral brother. Filming took place in New York City. Despite mixed reviews, the film was a box office success going on to gross over $159 million worldwide and being the highest-grossing installment of the trilogy.\n\nVinson's follow-up role was in Universal Pictures Straight-to-DVD film \"Blue Crush 2\", a sequel to the 2002 Drama/Romance film \"Blue Crush\" which starred Kate Bosworth and Michelle Rodriguez. Vinson portrayed the role of the film's villain Tara, an internationally successful pro-surfer. The film was released in June 2011. In October 2010 Vinson returned to Australia to begin production on Vinson's first role in an Australian film in the Paramount Pictures horror film \"Bait 3D\" as Tina, the protagonist's ex-girlfriend. The film follows a group of people trapped inside a flooded supermarket, following a freak tsunami, with a 12-foot great white shark. Vinson was reunited with former \"Home and Away\" cast member Lincoln Lewis. The film was shot in Brisbane on a $20 million budget. The film which was released in September 2012, was released to mixed reviews and failed to make an impact on the domestic box office. However, the film's found international box office success in China, Italy and Thailand, with the film returning its budget earning $29 million worldwide. \n\nFollowing \"Bait 3D\", Vinson was cast in another horror film project, which went on to be Vinson's most critically acclaimed role to date. \"You're Next\" centers on a family reunion, that goes terribly wrong once a group of mysterious masked killers start killing off each person one by one. Vinson portrayed the role of the film's protagonist Erin, the girlfriend to one of the family's sons. Vinson was able to portray Erin with her natural Australian accent. Initially an independent film, the film's premiere at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival secured the film with a distribution deal with Lionsgate. However, the film was not released till almost two years later following the festival, securing a North American release date in August 2013. The film received mostly positive reviews from critics, with Vinson's performance praised with Total Film placing her character in the number one spot on its '50 Most Bad-Ass Female Horror Leads'.\n\nIn March 2014 Vinson appeared in the Australian independent film \"Patrick\", a remake of the 1978 film of the same name.

It is the first installment in the Dylan bootleg series, comprising material spanning the first three decades of his career, from 1961 to 1989. It has been certified with a gold record by the RIAA as of August 1997, and peaked at on the \"Billboard\" 200 and in the UK.\n\nDylan has been subject to bootleg recordings throughout his career; the first bootleg of the rock era, \"Great White Wonder\", consisted of pirate recordings drawn from various sources. With the approach of Dylan's 30-year mark in the record industry, Columbia Records initiated the proper release of material that had circulated regularly on Dylan bootlegs, starting with this box set in 1991 to satisfy demand for Dylan's unissued material.\n\"The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3\" contains rarities and unreleased works from the sessions for 1962's eponymous debut \"Bob Dylan\" to 1989's \"Oh Mercy\". Of the 58 total tracks, 45 are session outtakes from recording sessions for Dylan studio albums. Of the remaining 13 tracks, one is an outtake from the session for the \"George Jackson\" single of 1971, two are further releases from the Basement Tape sessions of 1967, five are live recordings, and five are demo records, three of latter being later duplicated on of the series. \n\nThe material is spread across three compact discs, five vinyl records, or three cassette tapes. In the case of the compact disc and cassette versions, each individual disc or cassette is labeled in the set as a distinct volume. Subsequent albums in the Bootleg Series were standardized to a double-disc volume in their primary non-limited edition format, excepting for , and all continue the compact disc volume numbering. Unlike ensuing installments in the series, none of Volumes 1–3 are available individually in physical form.\n\nA remastered version in smaller packaging was issued on August 19, 1997, on Legacy Recordings, the reissue imprint of Sony Records.\n\nReviews of this set were generally positive, with exceptions. Robert Christgau gives it only cursory assessment on his website. In his 2006 \"Bob Dylan Encyclopedia\", author Michael Gray states that \"most artists couldn't muster a single outtake to hold alongside any of this; Dylan can provide 58 recordings almost every one of which is of numinous excellence.\" As of February 2020, a dozen further installments in this series have been released.\n\nAll songs written by Bob Dylan, except where noted; all arrangements by Bob Dylan.\n\n\n\n"}

The effect was found in high school students.\n\nFor children specifically, children who complete models using toy building blocks have much better spatial ability than children who do not complete such models. Spatial ability also predicts completion of models.\n\nConstruction toy play is also beneficial for autistic children when both individual and group play with building blocks is incorporated. Autistic children who played with building blocks were motivated to initiate social contact with children their age, they were able to maintain and endure contact with those children, and autistic children were also able to surpass the barriers of being withdrawn and being highly structured.\n\nRenowned architect Frank Lloyd Wright credited his childhood building blocks designed by Friedrich Fröbel as a major influence, and his son John Lloyd Wright created the widely known Lincoln Logs building set. In addition to teaching architectural concepts such as modularity and load-bearing construction, many architects credit construction set play as influencing their later design.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2147685", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2147685", "title": "Point process", "text": "Point process\n\nIn statistics and probability theory, a point process or point field is a collection of mathematical points randomly located on some underlying mathematical space such as the real line, the Cartesian plane, or more abstract spaces. Point processes can be used as mathematical models of phenomena or objects representable as points in some type of space.\n\nThere are different mathematical interpretations of a point process, such as a random counting measure or a random set. Some authors regard a point process and stochastic process as two different objects such that a point process is a random object that arises from or is associated with a stochastic process, though it has been remarked that the difference between point processes and stochastic processes is not clear. Others consider a point process as a stochastic process, where the process is indexed by sets of the underlying space on which it is defined, such as the real line or formula_1-dimensional Euclidean space. Other stochastic processes such as renewal and counting processes are studied in the theory of point processes. Sometimes the term \"point process\" is not preferred, as historically the word \"process\" denoted an evolution of some system in time, so point process is also called a random point field.\n\nPoint processes are well studied objects in probability theory and the subject of powerful tools in statistics for modeling and analyzing spatial data, which is of interest in such diverse disciplines as forestry, plant ecology, epidemiology, geography, seismology, materials science, astronomy, telecommunications, computational neuroscience, economics and others.\n\nPoint processes on the real line form an important special case that is particularly amenable to study, because the points are ordered in a natural way, and the whole point process can be described completely by the (random) intervals between the points. These point processes are frequently used as models for random events in time, such as the arrival of customers in a queue (queueing theory), of impulses in a neuron (computational neuroscience), particles in a Geiger counter, location of radio stations in a telecommunication network or of searches on the world-wide web.\n\nIn mathematics, a point process is a random element whose values are \"point patterns\" on a set \"S\". While in the exact mathematical definition a point pattern is specified as a locally finite counting measure, it is sufficient for more applied purposes to think of a point pattern as a countable subset of \"S\" that has no limit points.\n\nTo define general point processes, we start with a probability space formula_2,\nand a measurable space formula_3 where formula_4 is a locally compact\nsecond countable Hausdorff space and formula_5 is its\nBorel σ-algebra. Consider now an integer-valued locally finite kernel formula_6\nfrom formula_7 into formula_3, that is, a mapping\nformula_9 such that:\nThis kernel defines a random measure in the following way. We would like to think of formula_6\nas defining a mapping which maps formula_10 to a measure formula_18\n(namely, formula_19),\nwhere formula_20 is the set of all locally finite measures on formula_4.\nNow, to make this mapping measurable, we need to define a formula_22-field over formula_20.\nThis formula_22-field is constructed as the minimal algebra so that all evaluation maps of the form\nformula_25, where formula_13 is relatively compact),\nare measurable. Equipped with this formula_22-field, then formula_6 is a random element, where for every\nformula_10, formula_30 is a locally finite measure over formula_4.\n\nNow, by \"a point process\" on formula_4 we simply mean \"an integer-valued random measure\" (or equivalently, integer-valued\nkernel) formula_6 constructed as above.\nThe most common example for the state space \"S\" is the Euclidean space R or a subset thereof, where a particularly interesting special case is given by the real half-line [0,∞). However, point processes are not limited to these examples and may among other things also be used if the points are themselves compact subsets of R, in which case \"ξ\" is usually referred to as a \"particle process\".\n\nIt has been noted that the term \"point process\" is not a very good one if \"S\" is not a subset of the real line, as it might suggest that ξ is a stochastic process. However, the term is well established and uncontested even in the general case.\n\nEvery instance (or event) of a point process ξ can be represented as\n\nwhere formula_35 denotes the Dirac measure, \"n\" is an integer-valued random variable and formula_36 are random elements of \"S\". If formula_36's are almost surely distinct (or equivalently, almost surely formula_38 for all formula_39), then the point process is known as \"simple\".\n\nAnother different but useful representation of an event (an event in the event space, i.e. a series of points) is the counting notation, where each instance is represented as an formula_40 function, a continuous function which takes integer values: formula_41:\nwhich is the number of events in the observation interval formula_43. It is sometimes shown as formula_44 and formula_45 or formula_46 means formula_47.\n\nThe \"expectation measure\" \"Eξ\" (also known as \"mean measure\") of a point process ξ is a measure on \"S\" that assigns to every Borel subset \"B\" of \"S\" the expected number of points of \"ξ\" in \"B\". That is,\n\nThe \"Laplace functional\" formula_49 of a point process \"N\" is a\nmap from the set of all positive valued functions \"f\" on the state space of \"N\", to formula_50 defined as follows:\n\nThey play a similar role as the characteristic functions for random variable. One important theorem says that: two point processes have the same law if their Laplace functionals are equal.\n\nThe formula_1th power of a point process, formula_53 is defined on the product space formula_54 as follows :\n\nBy monotone class theorem, this uniquely defines the product measure on formula_56 The expectation formula_57 is called\nthe formula_1 th moment measure. The first moment measure is the mean measure.\n\nLet formula_59 . The \"joint intensities\" of a point process formula_6 w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure are functions formula_61 such that for any disjoint bounded Borel subsets formula_62\n\nJoint intensities do not always exist for point processes. Given that moments of a random variable determine the random variable in many cases, a similar result is to be expected for joint intensities. Indeed, this has been shown in many cases.\n\nA point process formula_64 is said to be \"stationary\" if formula_65 has the same distribution as formula_66 for all formula_67 For a stationary point process, the mean measure formula_68 for some constant formula_69 and where formula_70 stands for the Lebesgue measure. This formula_71 is called the \"intensity\" of the point process. A stationary point process on formula_72 has almost surely either 0 or an infinite number of points in total. For more on stationary point processes and random measure, refer to Chapter 12 of Daley & Vere-Jones. Stationarity has been defined and studied for point processes in more general spaces than formula_72.\n\nWe shall see some examples of point processes in formula_74\n\nThe simplest and most ubiquitous example of a point process is the \"Poisson point process\", which is a spatial generalisation of the Poisson process. A Poisson (counting) process on the line can be characterised by two properties : the number of points (or events) in disjoint intervals are independent and have a Poisson distribution. A Poisson point process can also be defined using these two properties. Namely, we say that a point process formula_6 is a Poisson point process if the following two conditions hold\n\n1) formula_76 are independent for disjoint subsets\nformula_77\n\n2) For any bounded subset formula_78, formula_79 has a Poisson distribution with parameter formula_80 where\nformula_70 denotes the Lebesgue measure.\n\nThe two conditions can be combined together and written as follows : For any disjoint bounded subsets formula_82 and non-negative integers formula_83 we have that\n\nThe constant formula_71 is called the intensity of the Poisson point process. Note that the Poisson point process is characterised by the single parameter formula_86 It is a simple, stationary point process.\nTo be more specific one calls the above point process, a homogeneous Poisson point process. An inhomogeneous Poisson process is defined as above but by replacing formula_87 with formula_88 where formula_89 is a non-negative function on formula_74\n\nA Cox process (named after Sir David Cox) is a generalisation of the Poisson point process, in that we use random measures in place of formula_87. More formally, let formula_92 be a random measure. A Cox point process driven by the random measure formula_92 is the point process formula_6 with the following two properties :\n\n\nIt is easy to see that Poisson point process (homogeneous and inhomogeneous) follow as special cases of Cox point processes. The mean measure of a Cox point process is formula_102 and thus in the special case of a Poisson point process, it is formula_103\n\nFor a Cox point process, formula_95 is called the \"intensity measure\". Further, if formula_95 has a (random) density (Radon–Nikodym derivative) formula_106 i.e.,\nthen formula_106 is called the \"intensity field\" of the Cox point process. Stationarity of the intensity measures or intensity fields imply the stationarity of the corresponding Cox point processes.\n\nThere have been many specific classes of Cox point processes that have been studied in detail such as:\n\nBy Jensen's inequality, one can verify that Cox point processes satisfy the following inequality: for all bounded Borel subsets formula_78,\n\nwhere formula_127 stands for a Poisson point process with intensity measure formula_128 Thus points are distributed with greater variability in a Cox point process compared to a Poisson point process. This is sometimes called \"clustering\" or \"attractive property\" of the Cox point process.\n\nAn important class of point processes, with applications to physics, random matrix theory, and combinatorics, is that of determinantal point processes.\n\nA Hawkes process formula_129, also known as a self-exciting counting process, is a simple point process whose conditional intensity can be expressed as\n\nformula_130\n\nwhere formula_131 is a kernel function which expresses the positive influence of past events formula_132 on the current value of the intensity process formula_133, formula_134 is a possibly non-stationary function representing the expected, predictable, or deterministic part of the intensity, and formula_135 is the time of occurrence of the i-th event of the process.\nGiven a sequence of non-negative random variables :formula_136, if they are independent and the cdf of formula_137 is given by formula_138 for formula_139, where formula_140 is a positive constant, then formula_141 is called a geometric process (GP) . \n\nThe geometric process has several extensions, including the \"α- series process\" and the \"doubly geometric process\" .\n\nHistorically the first point processes that were studied had the real half line R = [0,∞) as their state space, which in this context is usually interpreted as time. These studies were motivated by the wish to model telecommunication systems, in which the points represented events in time, such as calls to a telephone exchange.\n\nPoint processes on R are typically described by giving the sequence of their (random) inter-event times (\"T\", \"T\", ...), from which the actual sequence (\"X\", \"X\", ...) of event times can be obtained as\n\nIf the inter-event times are independent and identically distributed, the point process obtained is called a \"renewal process\".\n\nThe \"intensity\" \"λ\"(\"t\" | \"H\") of a point process on the real half-line with respect to a filtration \"H\" is defined as\n\"H\" can denote the history of event-point times preceding time \"t\" but can also correspond to other filtrations (for example in the case of a Cox process).\n\nIn the formula_40-notation, this can be written in a more compact form:\nformula_145.\n\nThe \"compensator\" of a point process, also known as the \"dual-predictable projection\", is the integrated conditional intensity function defined by\n\nformula_146\n\nThe \"Papangelou intensity function\" of a point process formula_147 in the formula_1-dimensional Euclidean space formula_149\nis defined as\n\nwhere formula_151 is the ball centered at formula_152 of a radius formula_35, and formula_154 denotes the information of the point process formula_147\noutside formula_156.\n\nThe logarithmic likelihood of a parameterized simple point process conditional upon some observed data is written as\n\nformula_157\n\nThe analysis of point pattern data in a compact subset \"S\" of R is a major object of study within spatial statistics. Such data appear in a broad range of disciplines, amongst which are\n\n\nThe need to use point processes to model these kinds of data lies in their inherent spatial structure. Accordingly, a first question of interest is often whether the given data exhibit complete spatial randomness (i.e. are a realization of a spatial Poisson process) as opposed to exhibiting either spatial aggregation or spatial inhibition.\n\nIn contrast, many datasets considered in classical multivariate statistics consist of independently generated datapoints that may be governed by one or several covariates (typically non-spatial).\n\nApart from the applications in spatial statistics, point processes are one of the fundamental objects in stochastic geometry. Research has also focussed extensively on various models built on point processes such as Voronoi Tessellations, Random geometric graphs, Boolean model etc.\n\n"}

It is also his first collection not to feature any original compositions since \"Dylan\" in 1973.\n\nOn the charts, \"Good as I Been to You\" reached in the US and in the UK, and helped to restore Dylan's critical standing following the disappointing \"Under the Red Sky\".\n\nSince launching the Never Ending Tour in June 1988, traditional covers became a feature at virtually every concert, often as part of an acoustic set. After recording \"Under the Red Sky\" in 1990, Dylan would not release an original song until 1997, and during that time, he would increasingly rely on his stockpile of covers for 'fresh' material. Dylan called these covers \"the music that's true for me.\"\n\nAccording to Dylan's friend Susan Ross, \"Good as I Been to You\" began life as a contractual filler. Dylan had scheduled two weeks at Chicago's Acme Recording Studio sometime in 1992, hiring long-time associate David Bromberg as his producer. An album's worth of songs, including the contemporary Christian ballad \"Rise Again,\" were recorded at those sessions with the accompaniment of a full band. The recording engineers on the sessions where Blaise Barton and Dan White. Bromberg was left to mix the recordings while Dylan completed a brief, 11-show tour in mainland Europe. There are several songs known to have been recorded during these sessions, including \"I'll Rise Again\" (trad.), \"Nobody's Fault but Mine\" (Blind Willie Johnson), \"Lady From Baltimore\" (Tim Hardin), \"Polly Vaughan\" (trad.), \"Casey Jones\" (trad.), \"Duncan and Brady\" (trad.), \"Kaatskill Serenade\" (David Bromberg), \"World Of Fools\" (David Bromberg), \"Sloppy Drunk\", and \"Miss the Mississippi.\"\n\nPrior to the release of , the only songs known to be circulating from these sessions are \"Kaatskill Serenade\", \"Sloppy Drunk\", \"Polly Vaughan\", and \"Miss the Mississippi\". \"Duncan and Brady\" was included in that set.\n\nWhen he returned to Malibu in mid-July, Dylan decided to record some solo acoustic material in his garage studio. The intention was to break up the Bromberg recordings with a few solo performances in between. As those garage sessions progressed, plans were changed, and the Bromberg recordings were pulled from the album.\n\nNeither Dylan nor Bromberg have explained why the Bromberg recordings were rejected and put away—they have never been released—and whether Dylan actually disliked them is unknown. It was made clear that Dylan was pleased with the results he was getting in his garage studio, particularly in the minimal production work given to the recordings. Producer credit was given to Debbie Gold, a friend of Dylan's who took a hands-off approach to the entire proceedings.\n\nWithout the use of notes or lyrics, Dylan recorded a wide range of traditional songs. \"Froggy Went A-Courtin',\" \"Blackjack Davey,\" and the anti-recruiting \"Arthur McBride\" were part of the British and Irish tradition of folk songs. \"Little Maggie\" was a popular bluegrass standard. \"Diamond Joe\" was well-known thanks to fellow folk revivalist Ramblin' Jack Elliott. \"Frankie and Albert\" and \"Sittin' on Top of the World\" both had long, deep roots in folk-blues.\n\nDylan also covered songs that weren't authentically traditional, such as \"Tomorrow Night\" (best known for Lonnie Johnson's hit version in 1947 and a version by Elvis Presley released in 1965) and Stephen Foster's \"Hard Times.\"\n\nThough Dylan is credited with all of the arrangements, several arrangements clearly belong to other artists, including the Texas songster Mance Lipscomb. A number of publications, including \"Folk Roots,\" criticized the album for making this error. Lipscomb's posthumous oral biography, \"I Say Me for a Parable\", edited by Glen Alyn, claims that Dylan listened to Mance play backstage at Newport in the early 1960s and then later took the stage and sang Mance's songs as his own.\n\nWhen time came to sequence the album, producer Debbie Gold was unable to convince Dylan to include \"You Belong to Me\". Though it wasn't authentically traditional, it was popular enough to be covered by Jo Stafford, Patti Page, and Dean Martin. The most popular version was recorded by the Duprees, one of the final Italian doo wop groups to make a wave in the early 1960s.\n\nTwo years later, the recording appeared in Oliver Stone's controversial film, \"Natural Born Killers\".\n\nThe response to \"Good as I Been to You\" was surprisingly positive, particularly for an album with very modest ambitions. It drew comparisons with the acoustic sets featured in Dylan's \"Never Ending Tour\" shows, drawing much praise for his interpretive skills. A number of critics pointed out that Dylan's voice was now physically ravaged, but the focus was often on the phrasing. \"Dylan sounds now, in comparison to his younger self, like one of those ghosts,\" wrote David Sexton of \"The Sunday Telegraph\", \"but a powerful ghost. The effect is not so much nostalgia...as deeply inward.\"\n\nThe inaccurate song credits created some controversy for Dylan. Nearly half of the songs were incorrectly credited, and in one case, Dylan faced legal action when Australian folksinger Mick Slocum sued Dylan's music publisher over the arrangement credit in \"Jim Jones.\" Slocum recorded his arrangement with his band, The Original Bushwhackers, in 1975, and Dylan's publisher was forced to concede their error.\n\n\"Good as I Been to You\" was successful enough to warrant a sequel, and in less than a year, Dylan returned to the studio to record \"World Gone Wrong\".\n\nAll songs are Traditional, arranged by Bob Dylan, except where noted.\n\n\n"}

Later he was owned by Al-Tufayl ibn Al-Harith, the stepson of Abu Bakr, who was also a member of this tribe but probably younger than Amir.\n\nHe became a Muslim in Mecca before 614. From 614 he was tortured in Mecca in an attempt to force him to recant his faith.

During his tenure, he won awards for Editor of the Year and Columnist of the Year from the Suburban Newspapers of America. His editorial writing also won awards from the Independent Free Papers of America. That organization also gave The Brooklyn Paper its Vic Jose Award in 2009. In that same year, The Brooklyn Paper was bought by the Community Newspaper Group, a subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation.\n\nKuntzman gave mainstream coverage to the 2008 Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest at Coney Island.\n\nIn 2010, CNG named him editor of four more print editions, including the Park Slope Courier. In 2011, those editions were consolidated under one name, Brooklyn Courier.\n\nIn 2012, Kuntzman became deputy managing editor for news at the \"New York Daily News\", where he later became a columnist until 2016.\n\nIn 2016, Kuntzman became the center of widespread attention when he wrote an article titled \"Firing an AR-15 is horrifying, menacing, and very very loud.\" In the article, Kuntzman says that he traveled to a gun range in Philadelphia to shoot a \"military-style weapon,\" so that he could better understand such weapons' appeals in the wake of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting. He says that \"It felt to me like a bazooka - and sounded like a cannon.\" Kuntzman further described the experience by saying that \"The recoil bruised my shoulder\" and \"The smell of sulfur and destruction made me sick.\" The most controversial part of the article was when Kuntzman claimed that \"The explosions - like a bomb - gave me a temporary form of PTSD.\" Kuntzman faced widespread criticism for the article, particularly the claim that he suffered from PTSD, with some critics saying that such a claim diminished the severity of PTSD suffered by veterans. Kuntzman later wrote another article further criticizing gun owners, but apologizing for the remarks about PTSD.\n\nIn April 2016, Kuntzman has criticized U.S. government's drone assassination program, and has even implied that the Obama administration may be guilty of war crimes. He also wanted President Obama to apologize for the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.\n\nFollowing the assassination of Andrei Karlov, Russian ambassador to Turkey, Andrei Karlov on 19 December 2016, Kuntzman compared his murder by Mevlüt Mert Altıntaş to the assassination of Nazi German diplomat Ernst vom Rath by Jewish student Herschel Grynszpan, saying \"justice has been served.\" The Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman wrote on her Facebook page to Kuntzman: \"you have said that the fight of the Jewish people against anti-Semitism in 1930s amounts to the terrorist ways of the Islamic State and Jabhat al-Nusra ...

{"id": "2147717", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2147717", "title": "Old Spanish Trail (trade route)", "text": "Old Spanish Trail (trade route)\n\nThe Old Spanish Trail () is a historical trade route that connected the northern New Mexico settlements of (or near) Santa Fe, New Mexico with those of Los Angeles, California and southern California. Approximately long, the trail ran through areas of high mountains, arid deserts, and deep canyons. It is considered one of the most arduous of all trade routes ever established in the United States. Explored, in part, by Spanish explorers as early as the late 16th century, the trail saw extensive use by pack trains from about 1830 until the mid-1850s.\n\nThe name of the trail comes from the publication of John C. Frémont’s Report of his 1844 journey for the U.S. Topographical Corps., guided by Kit Carson, from California to New Mexico. The name acknowledges the fact that parts of the trail had been known to the Spanish since the 16th century. Frémont's report named a trail that had already been in use for about 15 years. The trail is important to New Mexico history because it established an arduous but usable trade route with California.\n\nThe trail is a combination of known trails that were established by Spanish explorers, trappers, and traders with the Ute and other Indian tribes. The eastern parts of what became called the Old Spanish Trail, including southwest Colorado and southeast Utah, were explored by Juan Maria de Rivera in 1765. Franciscan missionaries Francisco Atanasio Domínguez and Silvestre Vélez de Escalante unsuccessfully attempted the trip to California, which was just being settled, leaving Santa Fe in 1776 and making it all the way into the Great Basin near Utah Lake before returning via the Arizona Strip. Other expeditions, under another Franciscan missionary, Francisco Garcés, and Captain Juan Bautista de Anza, then explored and traded in the southern part of the region, finding shorter and less arduous routes through the mountains and deserts that connected Sonora to New Mexico and California, but did not become part of the Old Spanish Trail, with the exception of some of the paths through the Mojave Desert. The Mohave Trail, first traveled by Garcés, from the Mohave villages on the Colorado River westward across the Mojave Desert, between desert springs, until he turned northwestward to the Old Tejon Pass into the San Joaquin Valley looking for a route to Monterey. Garcés then returned to the Colorado following the whole length of the Mohave Trail from the San Bernardino Valley over the San Bernardino Mountains at Monument Peak, down the Mojave River and eastward to the Colorado River. The same trail was used by the first Americans to reach California by land, the expedition led by Jedediah Smith in November 1826. The Mojave desert section of the Mohave Trail is now a jeep trail called the Mojave Road.\n\nA route linking New Mexico to California, combining information from many explorers, was opened in 1829-30 when Santa Fe merchant Antonio Armijo led a trade party of 60 men and 100 mules to California. Using a short cut discovered by Rafael Rivera the previous year, the Armijo party was able to stitch together a route that connected the routes of the Rivera and Domínguez-Escalante Expeditions and the Jedediah Smith explorations with the approaches to San Gabriel Mission through the Mojave along the Mojave River. Upon the return of Antonio Armijo, the governor of New Mexico immediately announced the success to his superiors in Mexico City. As a reward, the governor officially named Armijo \"Commander for the Discovery of the Route to California\". Armijo's route was documented by him in a report to the governor, and published by the Mexican government in June 1830.\n\nAfter this date, the route began to be used by traders for usually a single annual round trip. Word spread about the successful trade expedition and some commerce began between Santa Fe and Los Angeles. However, in 1830, due to resumed hostilities with the Navajo, the Armijo route west to the Colorado River Crossing of the Fathers was not practical, and a new route north of the river had to be found, which used the trails of the fur traders and trappers of New Mexico through the lands of the Utes. This route ran northwest to the Colorado and Green Rivers, then crossed over to the Sevier River, which it followed until crossing westward over mountains to the vicinity of Parowan, Utah. It then passed southward to the Santa Clara River, linking up with Armijo's route to California.\n\nThis commerce usually consisted of one mule pack train from Santa Fe with 20 to 200 members, with roughly twice as many mules, bringing New Mexican goods hand-woven by Indians, such as serapes and blankets, to California. California had many horses and mules, many growing wild, with no local market, which were readily traded for hand-woven Indian products. Usually two blankets were traded for one horse, more blankets were usually required for a mule. California had almost no wool processing industry and few weavers, so woven products were a welcome commodity. The trading party usually left New Mexico in early November to take advantage of winter rains to cross the deserts on the trail and would arrive in California in early February. The return party would usually leave California for New Mexico in early April to get over the trail before the water holes dried up and the melting snow raised the rivers too high. The return party often included several hundred to a few thousand horses and mules.\n\nLow-scale emigration from New Mexico to California used parts of the trail in the late 1830s when the trapping trade began to die. New Mexicans came to settle in Alta California by this route, some first settled in Politana then established the twin settlements of Agua Mansa and La Placita on the Santa Ana River the first towns in what became San Bernardino and Riverside Counties. The family of Antonio Armijo moved to Alta California and his father acquired the Rancho Tolenas. A number of Americans, most naturalized Mexican citizens in New Mexico, formerly in the California trade over the Old Spanish Trail or in the fur trade settled in Alta California and became important citizens in later years, like Louis Rubidoux, John A. Rowland, William Workman, Benjamin Davis Wilson, and William Wolfskill.\n\nThe trail was also used for illicit purposes, namely to raid the California ranchos for horses and for an extensive Indian slave trade. These horse raids were made by Mexicans, ex-trappers and Indian tribes, primarily the Utes, most famously Walkara, who together stole hundreds to thousands of horses in one raid. Native Americans, especially the Paiutes along the route of the trail, usually women and children, were captured and sold to Mexican ranchers, etc., in both California and New Mexico for domestic servants. Mexican traders and Indian raiding parties both participated in this slave trade. The consequences of this human trafficking had a long-standing effect for those who lived along the trail, even after the trail was no longer in use. Intermittent Indian warfare along the trail often resulted from these slave raids by unscrupulous traders and raiding Indians.\n\nJohn C. Frémont, \"The Great Pathfinder\", took the route, guided by Kit Carson, in 1844 and named it in his reports written up in about 1848. New Mexico-California trade continued until the mid-1850s, when a shift to the use of freight wagons and the development of wagon trails made the old pack trail route obsolete. By 1846 both New Mexico and California had become U.S. territories as a result of the Mexican–American War of 1846–1848, and after 1848 large numbers of Mormon immigrants were settling in Utah, Nevada, and California all along the trail, affecting both trade interests and tolerance for the slavery of American Natives.\n\n\"Place names used in this article refer to present-day states and communities. Few (if any) settlements existed along the trail, except in the coastal plains of Alta California, before 1850, although many of the geologic features along the Trail retain their Spanish designations.\"\n\nThe Armijo Route of the Old Spanish Trail was established by an expedition led by Antonio Armijo in 1829-1830. Leaving on November 7, 1829 Armijo's expedition traveled a route northwest and west of Santa Fe from Abiquiu, following the Chama River and the Puerco River, and he crossed to the amazing San Juan River basin. From the San Juan they entered the Four Corners area, passed north of the Carrizo Mountains to Church Rock, east of present-day Kayenta. The trail then ran to Marsh Pass and north through Tsegi Canyon into canyon country and to the Colorado River (then called the Rio Grande), where the travelers forded at the Crossing of the Fathers above present day Glen Canyon Dam.\n\nContinuing west to Pipe Spring and on to Virgin River above present day St. George, Utah, the expedition then followed the Virgin to the mouth of the Santa Clara River, which they followed up to the vicinity of the Shivwits Reservation. They then crossed southward over the Beaver Dam Mountains, at Utah Hill Summit to the Virgin River again, which they followed for three days down to the Colorado River, before turning west parallel to the river, over difficult terrain in the Black Mountains, to avoid the deep narrow gorge of Boulder Canyon, to the riverside oases of Callville Wash and Las Vegas Wash. Armijo waited there for his scouts to return, especially Rivera who had visited the Mohave villages down river before. Rivera returned, having recognized the Mohave Trail that led westward to Southern California. Perhaps because of the belligerence of the Mohave to parties of mountain men in recent years, or merely to save time, Armijo attempted a short cut route southwest to the mouth of the Mojave River.\n\nFrom Las Vegas Wash on the Colorado River, Armijo's expedition passed southwestward to Eldorado Dry Lake in Eldorado Valley and the spring at Goodsprings Valley, then through Wilson Pass, across Mesquite Valley and California Valley, through Emigrant Pass to Resting Springs, then along the Amargosa River from near Tecopa to Salt Spring. From Salt Spring they crossed a two-day-long waterless stretch up Salt Creek to \"Laguna del Milagro\" (\"Lake of the Miracle\"), (probably Silver Lake), then to Ojito del Malpais (\"little spring of the badlands\") on Soda Lake, then another waterless day beyond Soda Lake, where they reached the only intermittently dependable Mojave River and the Mohave Trail leading up river.\n\nBy now short of food, Armijo sent some of his scouts ahead to get more food in the settlement at San Bernardino de Sena Estancia. They followed the river for six days (110 miles to its head from the mouth), having to kill a mule or horse each day to eat. Probably at Summit Valley at the top of the river, east of Cajon Pass they met vaqueros of the San Bernardino de Sena Estancia with food. Armijo did not cross over the mountains by the Mohave Trail route over Monument Peak, but followed a route he called \"Cañon de San Bernardino\" from the upper Mojave River west through Cajon Pass and down Crowder Canyon and Cajon Canyon to the mouth of Cajon Pass, where the trail reached the coastal plain of San Bernardino Valley, a route no doubt known to the vaqueros of San Bernardino Estancia.\n\nOnce through the pass, they turned west along the foot of the San Gabriel Mountains for two days to San Jose Creek, then following it to cross the San Gabriel River at the Rancho La Puente, reaching Mission San Gabriel Arcángel on January 30, 1830. Armijo returned by the same route between March 1 and April 25, 1830. \n\nHe submitted a brief journal of his journey (itemizing the days with names of places where camps were made but with no distances) to the government of New Mexico, and it was published by the Mexican government in June 1830.\n\nThe Main Route (also referred to as the Central Route or the Northern Route) of the Old Spanish Trail avoided territory of the Navajo, (who had returned to a state of hostilities after Armijo's trip), and the more difficult canyon country traversed by the Armijo Route around the Colorado River. First traveled in 1830 by a party led by William Wolfskill and George Yount, this route ran northwest from Santa Fe through southwestern Colorado, past the San Juan Mountains, Mancos, and Dove Creek, entering Utah near present-day Monticello. The trail then proceeded north through difficult terrain to Spanish Valley near today's Moab, Utah, where a ferry crossed the deep and wide Colorado River and then turned northwest to a ferry crossing on the similarly sized and dangerous Green River near present-day Green River, Utah. The route then passed through (or around) the San Rafael Swell, the northernmost reach of the Trail. Entering the Great Basin in Utah via Salina Creek Canyon, the trail turned southwest following the Sevier, Santa Clara, Virgin Rivers to the north bank of the Colorado River. There they could follow the Colorado River to Las Vegas Wash, then south through the Eldorado Valley and Piute Valley to join the Mojave Trail, west of the Mohave villages (below modern Laughlin) and followed the route between the springs along the Mojave Trail to Soda Lake and the Mojave River. Later caravans could alternatively follow the Armijo Route diverting southwestward from the Colorado at Las Vegas Wash, to Resting Springs and to the Mojave River where it joined the Wolfskill/Yount Route, following that river upward to and over the San Bernardino Mountains through Cajon Pass, Crowder Canyon and lower Cajon Canyon and across the coastal valleys to Mission San Gabriel and Los Angeles.\n\nThe North Branch of the Old Spanish Trail was established by traders and trappers using Indian and Spanish colonial routes. It ran from Santa Fe north to Taos and on north into the San Luis Valley of Colorado. Caravans then headed west to today's Saguache, crossing over the Continental Divide at Cochetopa Pass, and then through present day Gunnison and Montrose to the Uncompahgre Valley. The trail then followed the Gunnison River to today's Grand Junction, where the Colorado River was forded, and then on west to join the Main Northern Route just east of the Green River. The North Branch later became an interest of explorers seeking viable routes for a transcontinental railroad along the 38th parallel. In 1853 alone, three separate expeditions explored the North Branch over Cochetopa Pass. These groups were led, in order, by Lieutenant Edward Fitzgerald Beale, Captain John Williams Gunnison, and John C. Frémont.\n\nUse of the Old Spanish Trail between 1829 and 1848 resulted in numerous variations as travelers adopted or blazed easier paths. But regardless of the route taken, the Old Spanish Trail crossed several mountain ranges, passed through dry sections with limited grass and sometimes limited water, crossed two deserts, and was often littered with the bones of horses that had died of thirst. The western portions of the Old Spanish Trail could only be used semi-reliably in winter when rains or snows deposited water in the desert. In summer, there was often no water and the oppressive heat could kill. A single round trip per year was about all that was feasible. After 1848, the western parts of the trail were used for winter access between Utah and California when other trails were closed by snow.\n\nSometime before 1844, perhaps as early as 1830, a cut off developed on the Old Spanish Trail that cut the distance traveled along the upper Mojave River, by cutting across what is now Victor Valley, from the Cajon Pass to a crossing just below the Lower Narrows of the river. On April 20, 1844, following the advice of his guide, John C. Frémont intercepted this route to the river, riding east southeast from Lake Elizabeth, north of the San Gabriel Mountains.\n\nAnother cutoff to the Armijo route of the Old Spanish Trail had developed before 1844, where the trail forked northeastward from the Mojave River and Mohave Trail, east of what is now Yermo, California, running up Spanish Canyon over Alvord Mountain, to Bitter Spring, then through Red Pass to join the Armijo route near Salt Spring in the Silurian Valley. Frémont also used this route in 1844. The fork of the trails there on the Mojave River, later became known as Fork of the Road.\n\nOne last modification to this route was that followed by John C. Frémont eastward in 1844. His expedition left the Armijo Route at Resting Spring and turned northeastward after crossing the Nopah Range through Emigrant Pass, through California Valley and across Pahrump Valley to Stump Spring and into the mountains to Mountain Springs, to Cottonwood Spring, to Las Vegas Springs. He then crossed the dry 50 miles to the Muddy River before rejoining the Main Route on the Virgin River at Halfway Wash after crossing what later became known as Mormon Mesa. This route saved the large distances caused by the diversion of the Armijo and Main routes to follow the Colorado River, and would later become the route of the Mormon Road, the wagon road through southern Nevada between Salt Lake City and Los Angeles.\n\nSee Also: National Trail map of Old Spanish Trail\n\nIn 1988, a section of the trail in Arches National Park was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nIn 2001, the section of the Trail that runs across Nevada from the Arizona border to California was placed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Old Spanish Trail/Mormon Road Historic District.\n\nThe Old Spanish Trail became the fifteenth national historic trail after Congress adopted Senate Bill 1946 and President George W. Bush signed the legislation in December 2002.\n\nAlthough few traces of the early traders' trail remain, the Trail is now commemorated in many local street and road names, and numerous historical markers in the states that it crossed. Portions of US 160 in Colorado and US 191 in Utah are similarly designated.\n\n"}
{"id": "2147719", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2147719", "title": "World Gone Wrong", "text": "World Gone Wrong\n\nWorld Gone Wrong is the 29th studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released on October 26, 1993, by Columbia Records.\n\nIt was Dylan's second consecutive collection of only traditional folk songs, performed acoustically with guitar and harmonica. The songs tend to deal with darker and more tragic themes than the previous outing, \"Good as I Been to You\".\n\nThe album received a warm, if not excited, reception from critics. Despite earning a Grammy award for Best Traditional Folk Album, it peaked at number 70 in the U.S., and at number 35 in the UK.\n\nLike its predecessor \"Good as I Been to You\", \"World Gone Wrong\" was recorded to fulfill the terms of his January 18, 1988, contract. It would be the final album released under that contract.\n\nIn May 1993, Dylan once again held sessions at his Malibu home inside his garage studio. Recorded solo in a matter of days, a total of 14 songs were recorded without a single change in guitar strings. Marked by distortion, the recording quality was very primitive by modern standards, with very casual microphone placement and very little tuning. There were some rumors that Dylan had mastered the album from cassette tapes, as Bruce Springsteen had done with \"Nebraska\", but those rumors have been as difficult to prove as they have been to dismiss.\n\nPossibly influenced by the controversy surrounding \"Good as I Been to You\", Dylan wrote a complete set of liner notes to \"World Gone Wrong\", citing all possible sources. It had been decades since Dylan had written his own liner notes, and they were always surrealistic; these notes, while still playfully written, were actually informative.\n\nThe balance of songs in \"World Gone Wrong\" swung more towards rural blues. Two had been recorded by the Mississippi Sheiks, two more by Blind Willie McTell, one by Willie Brown, and another by Frank Hutchison. Songs popularized by Tom Paley and Doc Watson were also recorded.\n\nIn the case of \"The Two Soldiers\", Dylan had been performing it live since 1988. As Clinton Heylin writes, on \"World Gone Wrong\" Dylan invested it \"with that classic impersonality the true traditionalist seeks\".\n\nFive songs were left over from the sessions, including versions of \"Goodnight My Love\", \"Twenty-One Years\", Robert Johnson's \"32-20 Blues\" and the Carter Family's \"Hello Stranger\". In 2008, \"32-20 Blues\" and another outtake from these sessions, \"Mary and the Soldier\", were released on \"\".\n\nThe album cover depicts Dylan wearing a top hat, seated at a table at Flukes Cradle Cafe bar in Camden Town, London. Hanging on the wall behind Dylan is a painting, \"L'Etranger\" by artist Peter Gallagher.\n\nThe response to \"World Gone Wrong\" was mixed-to-positive, with many regarding it as superior to \"Good as I Been to You\".\n\nRobert Christgau gave it an A– in his Consumer Guide column published in \"The Village Voice\". \"Dylan's second attempt to revive the folk music revival while laying down a new record without writing any new songs is eerie and enticing,\" wrote Christgau. \n\nIra Robbins wrote in \"Newsday\" that \"the record expresses as much about Bob Dylan's art as any collection of originals.\" Even music critic Bill Wyman, who dismissed \"Good as I Been to You\", wrote that \"it's a testament to his unpredictability that [\"Good as I Been to You\"] is tedious and \"World Gone Wrong\" is a signal document, a mesmerizing and sanguinary walk down the blood-soaked history of folk and blues. It also has his best liner notes since the 1960s.\"\n\nWyman was not the only critic enamored with the liner notes, which are written in strange, verbose prose. Andy Gill of \"The Independent\" wrote, \"it's the liner notes that offer the most interesting aspect of the album … [With] the songs steeped in deceit, treachery, venality and despair—not to mention his sometimes slightly berserk annotations—the picture builds up of the Blues as Bible Study, a series of lessons to be interpreted.\" Christgau, Greg Kot of the \"Chicago Tribune\", and many others expressed their enjoyment in reading the liner notes.\n\n\"World Gone Wrong\" went on to place 23rd on \"The Village Voice\"s Pazz & Jop Critics Poll for 1993.\n\nFollowing its release, Dylan was temporarily a freelance artist. As possible promotion for \"World Gone Wrong\", Dylan arranged for an acoustic television special to be accompanied by a live album release. Scheduled for mid-November at Manhattan's Supper Club, Dylan was accompanied by his current touring band, pedal steel and slide guitarist Bucky Baxter, guitarist John Jackson, bassist Tony Garnier, and drummer Winston Watson. After a series of rehearsals, Dylan performed four shows in front of a live audience, \"invest[ing] 'Jack-A-Roe,' 'Delia,' and Blind Boy Fuller's 'Weeping Willow' with a power and passion that had been missing from a whole year of lackluster performances,\" wrote Clinton Heylin. In addition to songs from his two most recent albums, the group performed acoustic renditions of \"Ring Them Bells\" and \"Queen Jane Approximately\" \"that spoke with all the hurt that inner voice felt when left crying to be heard\".\n\nFor reasons never explained, the TV broadcast and CD planned from these performances were all scrapped. It was an expensive decision, as Dylan had paid all expenses out of his own pocket, including those for a film crew and a multitrack digital console. Everything was filmed and recorded, but the results were shelved indefinitely (and are now widely bootlegged.)\n\nAt the end of 1993, Sony signed Dylan to another contract good for ten albums. A compilation and a live album would follow, but Dylan would take four years before releasing his next studio album, \"Time Out of Mind\", a collection of originals that won far more media attention than \"World Gone Wrong\".\n\nAll songs are Traditional, arranged by Bob Dylan, except where noted.\n\n"}

The political and economic changes wrought by the Great Depression and Second World War, and the adoption of the 1931 Statute of Westminster (ratified by Australia in 1942), necessitated the establishment and expansion of Australian representation overseas, independent of the British Foreign Office.

Translated by Guillaume, A. (1955). \"The Life of Muhammad\". Oxford: Oxford University Press.</ref>.\n\nHe lived in Mecca, and married his niece Salma bint Sakhar ibn Amir, who was known as \"Umm Al-Khayr\" (\"Mother of Goodness\"). They had several sons who did not survive infancy. When Abu Bakr was born in 573, he was therefore known as \"Atiq\" (\"exempted\" from death), while his subsequent brothers were given the related names \"Muataq\" and \"Muaytaq\".\n\nAbu Quhafa later married a younger woman, Hind bint Nuqayd. She bore him three daughters: Umm Farwa, Qurayba and Umm Amir.\n\nWhen Abu Bakr became a Muslim in 610, Abu Quhafa remained a pagan. When he spoke disparagingly of Muhammad, Abu Bakr struck his father’s chest and rendered him unconscious. It is said that Quran was written in response: \"You will not find a people who believe in Allah and the Last Day having affection for those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, even if they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kindred...\" When Abu Bakr ransomed Muslim slaves who were being persecuted in 613614, Abu Quhafa said to him: \"My son, I see that you are freeing weak slaves. If you want to do what you are doing, why don’t you free powerful men who could defend you and protect you?\" But Abu Bakr replied: \"I am only trying to do what I am attempting for Allah’s sake.\"\n\nIn old age, Abu Quhafa lost most of his sight.\n\nIn September 622 Abu Bakr emigrated to Medina, taking all his money with him \"to the amount of five or six thousand \"dirhams\".\" Abu Quhafa went to call on the family and said that he thought Abu Bakr “had put them in difficulty by taking off all his money.\" His granddaughter Asma said that Abu Bakr had left them plenty. \"I took some stones and put them in a niche where Abu Bakr kept his money; then I covered them with a cloth and took his hand and said, 'Put your hand on this money, Father.' He did so and said: 'There’s nothing to worry about; he has done well in leaving you this, and you will have enough.' In fact he had left us nothing, but I wanted to set the old man's mind at rest.\"\n\nIn January 630 Abu Quhafa heard that Muhammad's army was on the way to Mecca. He asked his young daughter to lead him to Mount Abu Qubays, and there he asked her what she could see. She told him, \"A mass of black.\" He said they were the cavalry. His daughter added that she could see a man running up and down in front of them, and he said that this was the army adjutant. Then his daughter announced that \"the black mass had spread.\" Abu Quhafa told her that the cavalry had been released so they must go home quickly. However, they met the army before they could reach their house, and a mounted warrior tore off his daughter's silver necklace. No other violence was done to them, for the conquest of Mecca was almost bloodless.\n\nAbu Bakr sought out his father and led him to the mosque. Muhammad greeted them with the words: \"Why did you not leave the old man in his house so that I could come to him there?\" But Abu Bakr replied that this way was more fitting. Muhammad sat Abu Quhafa down, \"and stroked his chest and asked him to accept Islam, and he did so.\" Abu Quhafa had white hair, so Muhammad told them to dye it. Abu Bakr then appealed to the army for the return of his sister’s necklace, but nobody admitted to taking it, so the family had to accept that, \"There is not much honesty among people nowadays.\"\n\nIt is said that when Abu Bakr died in Medina in August 634, Mecca was convulsed by an earthquake. Abu Quhafa asked, \"What is that?\" and was told that his son was dead. He replied, \"It is a terrible calamity. Who has arisen in authority after him?\" On being advised that Umar was now Caliph, he said, \"He was his companion,\" implying approval. Abu Quhafa returned his inheritance from his son to his grandson.\n\nAbu Quhafa died only a few months later, in March 635, \"at the age of 97.\" This age was calculated in lunar years; by the solar calendar, he would have been only 94 or 95.\n"}

There she also studied the piano under Waldemar Seidel. She spent the years from 1932 to 1936 as a student at the Royal College of Music in London, where she studied piano with Arthur Benjamin, conducting with Constant Lambert and Malcolm Sargent, and composition with Ralph Vaughan Williams. (She later asserted that the idea that opens Vaughan Williams' 4th Symphony was taken from her Sinfonietta for Small Orchestra (1935), and it reappears in her 1953 opera \"The Transposed Heads\".) Her teachers also included Egon Wellesz, in Vienna, and Nadia Boulanger, in Paris.\n\nShe was the first Australian composer whose work was performed at an International Society for Contemporary Music (ISCM) Festival (1938). This was her Choral Suite.\n\nFrom 1949 to 1955 she served as a critic for the \"New York Herald Tribune\", succeeding Paul Bowles, working under Virgil Thomson. At the same time she continued composing and was musical director at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. She was granted U.S. citizenship in 1949. After leaving America, she lived in Greece from 1957 to 1975. In the United States she asked George Antheil to revise his \"Ballet Mécanique\" for a modern percussion ensemble for a concert she helped to organize. In 1966, after years of failing eyesight, she was diagnosed with a brain tumour, which was surgically removed, and she regained her sight. However, a result of this operation was her loss of a sense of smell.\n\nShe died in Sydney in 1990. Her will established the Peggy Glanville-Hicks Composers' House in her home in Paddington, Sydney, as a residency for Australian and overseas composers. The organisation New Music Network established the Peggy Glanville-Hicks Address in her honour in 1999.\n\nHer instrumental works include the \"Sinfonia da Pacifica\", \"Etruscan Concerto\" (piano and orchestra), \"Concerto romantico\" (viola and orchestra), and the Sonata for Harp, premiered by Nicanor Zabaleta in 1953; performed by Marshall Maguire on the CD \"Awakening\", the work was named the Most Performed Contemporary Classical Composition at the APRA Music Awards of 1996. Her best known operas are \"The Transposed Heads\" and \"Nausicaa\". \"The Transposed Heads\" is in six scenes with a libretto by the composer after Thomas Mann and premiered in Louisville, Kentucky, on 3 April 1954.\n\n\"Nausicaa\" was composed in 1959–60 and premiered in Athens in 1961. The libretto is from the novel \"Homer's Daughter\" by Robert Graves and supports the theory that \"The Odyssey\", attributed to Homer, is actually a story told by women. Glanville-Hicks visited Graves on Majorca in 1956 and worked with his friend Alastair Reid to complete the libretto. The premiere was a major event in the operatic calendar, and was considered a triumph for Glanville-Hicks, but the opera has never been re-staged.\n\nHer last opera, \"Sappho\", was composed in 1963 for the San Francisco Opera, with hopes that Maria Callas would sing the title role. However, the company rejected the work and it has never been produced. This opera was recorded in 2012 by Jennifer Condon conducting the Gulbenkian Orchestra and with Deborah Polaski in the title role.\n\nShe was married to British composer Stanley Bate, who was homosexual, from 1938 to 1949, when they divorced. She married journalist Rafael da Costa in 1952; the couple divorced the following year. She was also involved with Mario Monteforte Toledo and Theodore Thomson Flynn. Like Bate, many of the men with whom Glanville-Hicks was close were gay; she had few intimate female friends, and often dressed in male attire. She was an intimate friend of the expatriate U.S. writer and composer Paul Bowles, and they remained very close all their lives, although their relationship was mainly epistolary after his move to Morocco in 1947.\n\n\n\n"}

He has authored a number of essays, including his seminal thesis \"The Political Economy of Peer Production\".\n\nBauwens regularly lectures internationally on P2P theory, the Commons and their potential for social change.\n\nIn the first semester of 2014 Bauwens was research director with the FLOK (Free Libre Open Knowledge) Society at IAEN, the National Institute of Advanced Studies of Ecuador. The FLOK Society developed a first of its kind Commons Transition Plan for the Ecuadorian government. Over fifteen policy papers the plan outlines policy proposals for transitioning Ecuador to what is described as a social knowledge economy based on the creation and support of open knowledge commons. One version of the plan is available online.\n\nHe currently lives in Chiang Mai, Thailand.\n\nIn \"The Political Economy of Peer Production\" Bauwens regards p2p phenomena as an emerging alternative to Capitalism, although he argues that \"Peer production is highly dependent on the market for peer production produces use-value through mostly immaterial production, without directly providing an income for its producers.\"<ref name=\"ctheory12/1/2005\"></ref> However, Bauwens goes on to argue that the interdependence is mutual: the capitalist system and market economies are also dependent on p2p production, particularly on distributed networks of information processing and production. Consequently, p2p economy may be seen as extending or already existing outside the sphere of free/open source software production and other non-rival immaterial goods.\n\nThis idea is explored also in the essay \"Peer to Peer and Human Evolution\" that expands the P2P meme beyond computer technology. It argues that egalitarian networking is a new form of relationship that is emerging throughout society, and profoundly transforming the way in which society and human civilization is organised. The essay argues that this new form of non-representational democracy is a crucial ingredient in finding the solutions to current global challenges; as well as a new and progressive ethos representing the highest aspirations of the new generations.\n\n\nBauwens has written for Open Democracy and Al Jazeera and has been mentioned by the New York Times, De Morgen, and Living Green Magazine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

At this time he began his friendship with Carl Hauptmann, brother of the famous author Gerhart Hauptmann. In 1879 he founded a secret racist youth society. In Gerhart Hauptmann's Drama \"Vor Sonnenaufgang\" (Before Sunrise) which was first performed on October 20, 1889, in Berlin, the key figure of the journalist Loth is based on Ploetz.\n\nAfter school Ploetz at first studied political economy in Breslau. There he joined the \"Freie wissenschaftliche Vereinigung\" (free scientific union). Among his friends were – besides his brother – his former school friend Ferdinand Simon (later son-in-law of August Bebel), the brothers Carl and Gerhart Hauptmann, Heinrich Laux, and Charles Proteus Steinmetz.\nThis circle enthusiastically read the works of Ernst Haeckel and Charles Darwin. Carl Hauptmann was a student of Ernst Haeckel, and Gerhart Hauptmann and Ploetz attended some of his lectures. The group expanded and developed a plan of founding a colony in one of the pacific states and established itself as the \"Pacific association\". They planned a \"community on friendly, socialist and maybe also pan-Germanic basis\". In consequence of the prosecution of socialistically minded persons in application of Otto von Bismarck's anti-socialist laws (1878–1890), in 1883 Ploetz fled to Zurich, where he continued to study political economy with Julius Platter (1844–1923). In his memoirs Ploetz states as an important reason for his choice of Zurich that in his studies in Breslau socialist theories were only incidentally mentioned.\n\nAfter living for a half a year in the United States, Ploetz returned to Zurich and began to study medicine. In 1886, he fell in love with a fellow student Agnes Bluhm despite being involved with Pauline Rüdin. They decided to get married early in 1887. Ploetz was also seeing an American named Mary Sherwood who was studying hypnotism. In 1890 Ploetz became medical doctor and married his former girlfriend Pauline, though the two never had children. Bluhm however kept Ploetz as a close friend throughout her life and they both shared similar views on racial purity and the benefits of eugenics. Ploetz and his wife lived in the US for four years, and divorced in 1898. Ploetz later married Anita Nordenholz. This marriage produced three children: Ulrich (called Uli), Cordelia (called Deda) and Wilfrid (called Fridl, 1912–2013).\n\nPloetz first proposed the theory of racial hygiene (race-based eugenics) in his \"Racial Hygiene Basics\" (\"Grundlinien einer Rassenhygiene\") in 1895. In 1904 Ploetz founded the periodical \"Archiv für Rassen-und Gesellschaftsbiologie\" with Fritz Lenz as chief editor, and in 1905 the German Society for Racial Hygiene (De Berliner Gesellschaft fur Rassenhygiene) with 31 members. page In 1907 the society became the \"International Society for Racial Hygiene\". In 1930 he became an honorary doctor of the University of Munich.\n\nPloetz was a supporter of the Nazi Party, which took power in 1933. Ploetz wrote in April 1933 that he believed Hitler would bring racial hygiene from its previous marginality into the mainstream.\n\nIn 1933 Reich Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick established an \"expert advisory committee for population and racial policy,\" which included Ploetz, Fritz Lenz, Ernst Rüdin and Hans F.K. Günther. This expert advisory committee had the task of advising the Nazis on the implementation and enforcement of legislation regarding racial and eugenic issues. In 1936, Hitler appointed Ploetz to a professorship.\n\nIn 1937 he joined the Nazi party.\n\nHe died at the age of 79 and is buried at his home in Herrsching on the Ammersee in Bavaria. After his death, Otmar Freiherr von Verschuer praised his \"inner sympathy and enthusiasm [with] the National Socialist Movement\". Ernst Rüdin, also a committed National Socialist, praised Ploetz two years before as a man \"by his meritorious services has helped to set up our Nazi ideology.\"\n\nIn his book \"The efficiency of our race and the protection of the weak\" (1895) he described a society in which eugenic ideas were applied. Society would examine the moral and intellectual capacity of citizens to decide on marriage and the permitted number of children. It may also include a prohibition on reproduction. Disabled children are aborted, the sick and weak, twins and children whose parents Ploetz considers too old or young, are \"eliminated\".\n\nAlong with many other eugenicists in Europe and America, Ploetz believed in the superiority of the Nordic race. His writings were a major influence on Nazi ideology. His opinion of the Jewish Question changed during the course of his life, but his view and the doctrine of the NSDAP were in accord by the time the party came to power in 1933.\n\nIn his early writings Ploetz credited Jews as the second highest cultural race after Europeans. He identified no substantial difference in \"racial character\" between Aryans and Jews, arguing that the mental abilities of Jews and their role in the development of human culture made them indispensable to the \"process of racial mix\" which would enhance humanity.\n\nThe high aptitude of the Jews and their outstanding role in the progress of mankind considering men like Jesus, Spinoza, Marx has to be kindly acknowledged without hesitation... All this Antisemitism is a flop which will vanish slowly in the light of scientific knowledge and a humane democracy\".\n\nLater he revised this view. He stressed that the distinctiveness of Jews indicated that their mental characteristics would adversely affect Aryans by introducing individualism and lack of love for the military and the nation. He favored the global dominance of the Aryan race.\n\n\n"}

Its team mascot is the Sundevils and its school colors are maroon and gold.\n\nEldorado High School was established in 1973 on an open desert lot just west of the Las Vegas Wash between Washington and Bonanza Roads. The school opened in September 1973 along with Chaparral High School, which brought the total number of major high schools in the Las Vegas Valley to eight, including Bishop Gorman, a private Catholic high school. For the first 15 years, Eldorado's zoning covered all of the Sunrise Mountain area north of Charleston Boulevard and east of Pecos Road, which resulted in a total school attendance of more than 2,000. The largest known class to graduate from Eldorado to date was in 1985, graduating about 550 student). The majority of the students are former students of Dell H. Robison Middle School, O'Callaghan Middle School, Monaco Middle School and Bailey Middle School. In the 1980s, Eldorado received former students from Robison and Von Tobel Middle Schools as well as a handful from Roy Martin Middle School. Today, its zoning border covers areas east of Nellis Boulevard, north of Bonanza Road and south of Owens Avenue.\n\nIts campus is bordered by Washington Avenue, Linn Lane, Harris Avenue and Christy Lane, built with an enclosed building (no windows), an American football stadium with an asphalt running track (one of the first high schools in Las Vegas to have such a track) and a state of the art \"sportatorium\", used for basketball, volleyball and wrestling as well as assemblies and other school-related activities. Three other Las Vegas area schools were built this way: Basic High School, Bonanza High School and the Southeast Career Technical Academy (also known as Vo-Tech); all built in the early to mid-1970s along with Eldorado. Basic and Bonanza were built according to the same blueprints as Eldorado.\n\nIn 2007, the former facilities of Bishop Gorman were purchased by CCSD to house the rising number of freshmen and to ease overcrowding at the main campus. Eldorado Preparatory Academy, the name of the temporary ninth grade campus, closed in spring 2009 when students were rezoned to Sunrise Mountain High School.\n\nThe campus is the location of the Sundevil Theater. The theater has put on many plays, including \"The Curious Savage\" and \"Carousel\".\n\nThe Sundevils compete in the Sunrise 4A Region and are classified as a 4A school, the largest classification in Nevada according to the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association.\n\nOne of the most successful athletics program at Eldorado has been wrestling; the school has won 12 state championships. The Sundevils were ranked 12th of the High School Scholastic Dynasty Teams of the Last Decade.\n\nThe school has held a state championship in each of American football (1991), boys' basketball (1985), baseball (1990) and soccer (2013). Eldorado also holds Nevada state championships in track and field.\n\nEldorado High School's Naval Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps (NJROTC) Unit, established not long after the school opened, is a part of Naval District 13, and has received multiple awards recognizing the Sundevil Battalion as both an Honor Unit (top 10% of units in the Naval District) and a Chief of Naval Education and Training Command Honor Unit (top 10% of all NJROTC Units) over the years.\n\n\nEvery year, since 1974, Eldorado and Chaparral hold their rivalry game, in which the winner takes possession of a bronzed cleat once owned by the former Los Angeles Rams star Merlin Olsen.\n\n"}
{"id": "2147769", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2147769", "title": "NESARA", "text": "NESARA\n\nNational Economic Security and Recovery Act (NESARA) was a set of proposed economic reforms for the United States suggested during the 1990s by Harvey Francis Barnard. Barnard claimed that the proposals, which included replacing the income tax with a national sales tax, abolishing compound interest on secured loans, and returning to a bimetallic currency, would result in 0% inflation and a more stable economy. The proposals were never introduced before Congress.\n\nNESARA has since become better known as the subject of a cult-like conspiracy theory promoted by Shaini Candace Goodwin, doing business as \"Dove of Oneness\", who claimed that the act was actually passed with additional provisions as the National Economic Security and Reformation Act, and then suppressed by the George W. Bush administration and the Supreme Court. Goodwin's conspiracy emails have been translated into several languages and have a large following online.\n\nHarvey Francis Barnard (1941–2005), a Louisiana State University graduate in systems philosophy, and an engineering consultant and teacher, created the NESARA proposal during the late 1980s and early 1990s. He printed 1000 copies of his proposal, titled \"Draining the Swamp: Monetary and Fiscal Policy Reform\" (1996), and sent copies to members of Congress, believing it would pass quickly on its merits. Based on a theory that debt is the number one economic factor inhibiting the growth of the economy, and compound interest the number one \"moral evil\" and reason for debt, Barnard made several other attempts during the 1990s to draw political attention to the problems he saw in the US economy, and his suggested economic recovery proposal based on the root causes he determined. After these did not succeed, he decided in 2000 to release the proposal to the public domain and publish it on the internet. Barnard established the NESARA Institute in 2001, and published the second edition of his book in 2005, retitling it \"Draining the Swamp: The NESARA Story – Monetary and Fiscal Policy Reform\".\n\nSoon after Barnard released NESARA on the internet, a user known as \"Dove of Oneness\" began posting about it in internet forums. \"Dove of Oneness\" was later identified as Shaini Candace Goodwin, a former student of The Ramtha School Of Enlightenment, referred to in the media as a \"cybercult queen.\" According to Goodwin's website, the NESARA bill languished in Congress before finally being passed by a secret session in March 2000 and signed by President Bill Clinton. It is claimed that the new law was to be implemented at 10 a.m. on September 11, 2001, but that the computers, and data (of the beneficiaries of the trillions of dollars of \"Prosperity funds\") were destroyed on the second floor of one of the World Trade Center towers in New York City during the terrorist attacks. Supposedly an earlier gag order issued by the Supreme Court had prohibited any official or private source from discussing it, under penalty of death. Goodwin referred to \"White Knights,\" most of them high-ranking military officials, who have since been struggling to have the law implemented despite opposition by President George W. Bush. Goodwin allegedly believes and purports that Bush orchestrated the September 11 attacks and the Iraq War as distractions from NESARA. Goodwin's description of NESARA goes far beyond Barnard's proposal by cancelling all personal debts, abolishing the Internal Revenue Service, declaring world peace, and requiring new presidential and congressional elections. Goodwin often claimed that Bush officials were attempting to hack into and bring down her web site to prevent her from publicizing the law.\n\nGoodwin began commenting on NESARA in connection with Omega Trust, a fraudulent investment scheme whose creator, Clyde Hood, was on trial at the time. According to Goodwin, Omega Trust investors would receive their returns after NESARA was announced. Goodwin repeatedly predicted that the NESARA announcement would occur in the very near future, although in later years she became more reserved in these predictions.\n\nAfter Goodwin began commenting on NESARA, other internet-based conspiracy theorists latched onto it. One supporter, Sheldan Nidle, ties the imminent NESARA announcement into his years-old prophecy of an imminent large scale UFO visitation by benevolent aliens (occasionally on his website reports, but more prominently in his videos, seminars and public appearances). Jennifer Lee, who used to publish internet NESARA status reports almost daily on her now defunct site, discussed a host of other-worldly and \"interdimensional\" beings who are helping behind the scenes to get NESARA announced. Internet evangelist Sherry Shriner, who operates many websites, sees NESARA as linked to malevolent reptiloid aliens she feels have long controlled the U.S. Government.\n\nNESARA groups are known for certain to exist and to have attracted press attention in Utah, and the Netherlands. Members of these groups get together to discuss the status of NESARA, read the various reports, hold protests, and pass out fliers about NESARA to the public. Goodwin claims that NESARA groups exist throughout several nations and US states including California, Washington, Arizona, and Texas, and provides hundreds of pieces of photographic evidence of people in public protests holding NESARA banners, but it is not clear to what degree the people holding the banners are aware of what NESARA is, or for how long these groups were active. \"The News Tribune\" has traced the story behind at least some of these photos (photos of trucks driving around Washington, D.C. bearing the words \"NESARA Announcement Now!\"), and found that they were part of a $40,000 advertising campaign allegedly paid for an elderly San Francisco resident who had made donations to Goodwin.\n\nBarnard became aware of Goodwin's description of NESARA before his death in 2005. He denied that NESARA had been enacted into law or even assigned a tracking number, and condemned Goodwin's allegations as a disinformation campaign. Goodwin, for her part, dismisses the NESARA Institute as a disinformation front for the Bush family.\n\nSome NESARA detractors claim that NESARA is a cult designed primarily to provide an income to Goodwin and others. They point to the fact that Goodwin, Lee, and Nidle frequently asked their readers to donate money. Goodwin, who also asked readers to donate their frequent flyer miles, claimed that she needed and had used the funds to travel to various locations around the world to secretly meet with high-level government officials about getting NESARA announced.\n\nSome NESARA supporters also make the claim that otherworldly beings are working to get NESARA announced. These include a \"channeled\" cosmic being called \"Hatonn\" (an android Pleiadean), and another named Sananda. According to some Ascended Master Teaching proponents such as Joshua David Stone, Sheldan Nidle, and Luis Prada, Sananda is the \"galactic name\" of Ascended Master Jesus, which he uses in his role as Commander-in-Chief of the Ashtar Command flying saucer fleet. Pallas Athena is regarded as being the Vice-Commander of the saucer fleet. Ashtar (Ashtar Sheran) is regarded in these teachings as being third-in-command. According to David Icke, Saint Germain, an Ascended Master borrowed from the I AM Movement and the Church Universal and Triumphant, along with benevolent aliens from the Galactic Federation, are also frequently mentioned (most prominently by Nidle) as working towards the NESARA announcement. The designation of George W. Bush as a disguised reptilian often co-occurs with this claim. Goodwin has claimed that Ascended Master Saint Germain has come down from the etheric plane to physically meet with heads of banks and world leaders regarding the NESARA announcement.\n\nThe prominence of failed prophecy also lends support to the cult theory. NESARA supporters often tell their readers that the NESARA announcement is going to happen in a matter of days. These claims have been made too many times to enumerate, without ever coming to fruition. According to the documentary \"Waiting For NESARA\", the claim was also made prior to March 2003 that George Bush was planning the war with Iraq only to further delay the NESARA announcement. It was prophesied that spiritual beings and UFOs would intervene with Bush's plans and prevent the war.\n\nA June 2006 complaint to the Washington consumer protection division accused Goodwin of using the NESARA story to defraud a 64-year-old San Francisco woman of at least $10,000. The woman's daughter said the actual amount is much larger, in the hundreds of thousands.\n\n"}
{"id": "2147772", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2147772", "title": "Rhythmic contemporary", "text": "Rhythmic contemporary\n\nRhythmic contemporary, also known as Rhythmic Top 40, Rhythmic CHR or rhythmic crossover, is a primarily American music-radio format that includes a mix of EDM, upbeat rhythmic pop, hip hop and upbeat R&B hits. Rhythmic contemporary never uses rock or country in its airplay, but it may occasionally use a reggae, Latin, reggaeton, or a Christian/gospel hit. Essentially, the format is a cross between mainstream radio and urban contemporary radio formats.\n\nAlthough some top-40 stations such as CKLW in Windsor/Detroit made their mark by integrating a large amount of R&B and soul product into their predominantly pop playlists as early as 1967, such stations were still considered mainstream top 40 (a cycle that continues to dominate the current Top 40/CHR chart). It was not until the disco era of the late 1970s that such stations came to be considered as a format of their own as opposed to top-40 or soul. This development was largely spurred by the highly successful \"worst-to-first\" debut of the disco-based format on \nWKTU on 92.3 FM in New York City (now WNYL) in 1978. That station was classified as disco but actually played a blend of disco, dance music, and pop crossovers. At that time, stations playing strictly R&B tracks were known as \"black\" or \"soul\" stations. Stations such as WKTU came to be known as urban contemporary in the early 1980s as the disco era ended. In the 1980s, many urban contemporary stations began to spring up. Most of these leaned more towards R&B than dance music. These urban stations began sounding identical to so-called black stations and by 1985, stations that played strictly R&B product were all known as urban stations. Still, some urban outlets continued adding artists from outside the format onto their playlist. In most cases it was dance and rhythmic pop but in other cases they added a few rock songs. For example, Detroit's successful WDRQ included artists such as Cyndi Lauper, Culture Club and The Romantics in its urban format circa 1984. \n\nBut it wasn't until January 11, 1986 that KPWR in Los Angeles, a former struggling adult contemporary outlet, began to make its mark with this genre by adopting this approach. It would be known as crossover because of the musical mix and the avoidance of most rock at the time. Shortly afterward WQHT in New York adopted a similar crossover format and enjoyed similar ratings success. The new breed of crossover stations broke a number of popular artists, including Expose and The Cover Girls, but such artists couldn't reach either the Billboard Hot 100 or Hot Black Singles charts because their airplay was split between a handful of mainstream top-40 and black reporting stations. \"Billboard magazine\" thus debuted its first rhythmic top-40 airplay chart, the \"Hot Crossover 30,\" in its February 28, 1987 issue. The Crossover panel's initial lineup of 18 stations included five exclusive Crossover reporters (KPWR, WQHT, WHQT Miami, WMYK Norfolk, and WOCQ Ocean City, MD) as well as 13 stations which also retained their prior CHR or black reporter status (among them WPOW Miami, WHRK Memphis, KMEL San Francisco, WHYT Detroit, WQUE New Orleans, WLUM Milwaukee. and XHRM Tijuana/San Diego). This was the first rhythmic top-40 airplay chart in any radio/records trade magazine. The chart's first number one song was \"Lean on Me\" by Club Nouveau.\n\nToday, Mega 97ONE in Santa Maria broadcasts such a format. \n\nFor years since its inception, the rhythmic name has been a source of confusion among music trades, especially in both \"Billboard\" (which used the Rhythmic Top 40 title) and \"Radio & Records\" (which use the CHR/rhythmic title for their official charts). In August 2006 \"Billboard\" dropped both the \"top 40\" and \"CHR\" name from the rhythmic title after its sister publication Billboard Radio Monitor merged with \"Radio & Records\" to become the \"New\" \"R&R\" as part of their realignment of format categories. The move also ended confusion among the radio stations who report to their panels, which was modified by the end of 2006 with the inclusion of non-monitored reporters that were holdovers from the \"(Old) R&R\" days.\n\nStill, over the years since its inception, the genre has grown and evolved in its position between traditional R&B outlets (who claim that the Rhythmic contemporary format does not target or serve the African-American community properly) and the traditional Top 40 hit stations. However, both R&B and mainstream top 40 outlets have taken cues from the Rhythmic contemporary format through the years; as of 2018, the cycle continues to dominate the current Top 40/CHR playlist as more Rhythmic and EDM songs are making their way onto the Mainstream chart. \n\nAn offshoot format of rhythmic contemporary is rhythmic adult contemporary, which targets an adult audience with a mix of current rhythmic hits and gold tracks (often termed \"Throwbacks\") which may date as far back as the 1980s or even the disco era of the 1970s. As with Rhythmic CHR, Rhythmic AC may vary depending on the market as to how much hip-hop and R&B product are included in the playlist; for example, the current WKTU (one of the late 1990s pioneers of the recent crop of Rhythmic AC stations) leans toward pop and dance, while WBQT in Boston is very hip-hop heavy.\n\n"}

He was a Quraysh leader and a member of the Banu 'Abdu Shams clan of Quraish tribe.\n\n‘Uqbah was the son of Abu Mu‘ayṭ ibn Abu ‘Amr ibn Umayyah ibn ‘Abd Shams and of Shayma bint Abd-al-Uzza from the Banu Amir. Abu Mu'ayt's mother was Kabsha bint Abd al-Manat from Banu Amir. Uqbah's aunt, Safiyya bint Abi ‘Amr, married Abu Sufyan.\n\nHe married Arwa bint Kurayz, a member of the Abdshams clan and the widow of ‘Affān ibn Abu al-‘Āṣ, making Uqba the stepfather of the future Caliph Uthman, Abd-Allah and Amina. Uqba and Arwa had six children: Walid, Ammara, Khalid, Umm Kulthum, Umm Hakim and Hind. All of his children became Muslims.\n\nUqbah was one the neighbors of Muhammad. Yet he assaulted Muhammad verbally and physically as he was preaching monotheism\nHe also constantly ridiculed Muhammad when the latter was preaching in Mecca. On one occasion, when Muhammad was praying in the courtyard of the Ka'ba, Uqba brought the waste of a slaughtered camel (intestines, blood, dung etc.) upon the suggestion of other Quraysh leaders who were gathered there, and placed it upon Muhammad's back while he was in prostration. They laughed so much so that they fell on each other. He remained in that position due to the weight, unable to lift his head from prostration until his daughter came and removed it.\n\nOn another occasion, Uqba spat on Muhammad's face at the incitement of his friend Ubay ibn Khalaf. According to the Islamic tradition, the Quranic verse was revealed at that moment to Muhammad regarding Uqba and Ubay. Uqbah was also one of those enemies of Muhammad who rejoiced at the news of the death of Muhammad's second son 'Abdullah.\n\nUbayy ibn Khalaf ibn Wahb ibn Ḥudhāfa was a very close friend of ‘Uqbah. When Ubayy came to know that ‘Uqba had sat and listened to the apostle, he told ‘Uqbah, ‘Do I hear that you have sat with Muhammad and listened to him? I swear I will never see you or speak to you again if you do the same again, or if you do not go and spit in his face.’ ‘Uqba indeed did this so that Allah sent down concerning the pair of them: \n“On the day that the sinner bites his hands, saying, would that I had chosen a path with the apostle.” (Sura 25: 27) \n\nAccording to numerous authentic and trustworthy sources such as a number of narrations in Sahih Bukhari, and Ibn Sa'd's biographical compendium, the \"Tabaqat Al-Kubra\", Uqba was killed in the field of battle, during the Battle of Badr and was among those Quraysh leaders whose corpses were buried in a pit.\nHowever, according to Ibn Hisham's biography, Uqba was executed on the order of Muhammad by Asim bin Thaabit as a prisoner after the Battle of Badr. According to Muslim scholar Safiur Rahman al-Mubarakpuri, after the Battle of Badr two captives – Nadr bin Harith and ‘Uqbah ibn Abū Mu‘ayṭ were beheaded by Ali. Mubarakpuri mentions that this incident about the beheading is also mentioned in the Sunan Abu Dawud no 2686 and Anwal Ma'bud 3/12\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2147795", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2147795", "title": "Luigi D'Albertis", "text": "Luigi D'Albertis\n\nLuigi Maria D'Albertis (21 November 1841 – 2 September 1901) was an Italian naturalist and explorer who, in 1875, became the first Italian to chart the Fly River in what is now called Papua New Guinea. He undertook three voyages up this river from 1875 to 1877. The first was conducted in the steamer SS Ellengowan and the other two in a smaller ship named the \"Neva\" which was chartered from the Government of New South Wales. Throughout the three voyages, D'Albertis was consistently involved in skirmishes with the various indigenous people living along the river, using rifle-fire, rockets and dynamite to intimidate and, on occasions, kill these local people. He also frequently employed destructive dynamite fishing as a technique of obtaining aquatic specimens for his collection. His expedition stole many ancestral remains, tools and weapons from the houses of the locals. He also collected specimens of birds, plants, insects and the heads of recently killed native people. Contemporary explorers and colonial administrators of d'Albertis were almost universally critical of the methods employed by D'Albertis in his expeditions up the Fly and more modern accounts, such as Goode's \"Rape of the Fly\" are equally condemnatory. \n\nD'Albertis was born in 1841, in Voltri, Italy. At the age of eighteen he joined Garibaldi's army and later joined Odoardo Beccari in November 1871 on an expedition to western New Guinea. He reached the peak of Mount Arfak Geb but was compelled by fever to retreat and return to Sydney to recover. In 1874, D'Albertis returned to New Guinea to set up a base on Yule Island. Here he obtained notoriety for publicly kissing the most attractive young native women and passing it off as a customary sign of peace. He also, with a shell full of burning methylated spirits, ostentatiously threatened to set the ocean alight. Most of his companions and employees deserted him after these activities.\n\nD'Albertis conducted his first trip to the Fly River in the SS Ellengowan steamer which left from the British colonial port of Somerset on the tip of the Cape York peninsula. On board were Captain Runcie, Rev. MacFarlane and the Police Magistrate of Somerset, H.M. Chester with six troopers of the Queensland Native Police. Their first stop was Tawan Island where Chester rounded up the inhabitants and warned them against stealing from the missionaries in the area. To emphasise his point, he ordered his troopers to obliterate a nearby termite mound with rounds from their Snider Rifles. As they began to navigate up the Fly River, D'Albertis had a collision with the native people and after shooting a number of rounds at their watercraft, Chester and his troopers dispersed them causing them to flee in terror. As \"a trophy of victory\", Chester stole a sixty foot canoe and utilised it for firewood for the ship's engine. At other places along the river D'Albertis set off dynamite and rockets to both intimidate the indigenous people and to obtain aquatic life for food and specimen material. On their return downriver, they accepted an invitation from native people to enter their village, but Chester and his troopers, \"wishing to intimidate them\" decided to let off a number of shots, killing and stealing a couple of large domesticated pigs. Chester then proceeded to ransack the long-house of the village, taking ancestral and sacred human remains, weapons and other artefacts for D'Albertis' collection.\n\nD'Albertis' second sojourn to the river was on the \"Neva\" which was chartered from the Government of New South Wales. On board was Lawrence Hargrave, a future pioneer of aviation. D'Albertis again used rockets and dynamite as a weapons of fear. He removed intricate bark carvings on trees which he recognised was \"perhaps a sacrilege\" but did it anyway. Likewise, he stole ancestral bones from sacred long-houses claiming that \"I shall turn a deaf ear to this sacrilege..I am too delighted with my prize\". The \"Neva\" forced its way upstream until brought to a halt by the shallows. They then steamed downriver to a tributary d'Albertis had named the Alice River (today known as the Ok Tedi). Eventually stricken by malaria and crippled by rheumatism in both legs, he admitted defeat and returned to the Torres Strait.\n\nThis was the final and probably the most eventful of the journeys of D'Albertis up the Fly River. On the first day of June, D'Albertis managed to get his crew and himself involved in a pitched battle with an armed flotilla of native watercraft. D'Albertis himself claimed to have fired about 120 shots in this skirmish which resulted in \"some deaths\" of indigenous people. None of his crew were killed but the hull of the \"Neva\" was riddled with arrows, some of which penetrated through the boards. For most of early July, D'Albertis was involved in daily clashes with native people along the river, shooting some of them dead. On one occasion, D'Albertis found the corpse of one of those killed and decided to decapitate him and preserve the head in spirits for his collection. He later killed one of his Chinese servants for refusing to go into the jungle to shoot specimens of local fauna. D'Albertis killed him by hitting him on the back a number of times with a bamboo cane which broke during the punishment. The other Chinese servants subsequently fled into the jungle, preferring to take their chances in unknown territory than to stay with the expedition. \n\nReturning downriver in late October, D'Albertis again had several affrays with indigenous people killing at least seven. In one of these battles, D'Albertis decided to \"let them have it, and their blood be on their own heads\". After this encounter he became extremely wary, ordering every native canoe to be shot at on sight. During this trip, as with the others, D'Albertis regularly engaged in dynamite fishing, claiming that \"I think dynamite is..the best means to use, especially among coral reefs\". Once back in the Torres Strait, two other deserters from his expedition brought charges against D'Albertis for murdering his Chinese servants. The police magistrate, H.M. Chester, a colleague of D'Albertis, promptly dismissed the charges and jailed the two Polynesian men for 16 weeks under charges of mutiny. D'Albertis wanted the men executed, but begrudgingly accepted the sentence.\n\nNot long after, D'Albertis returned to Europe with his bounty of stolen goods. His cousin, fellow explorer Enrico Alberto d'Albertis, housed many of Luigi's specimens at Castello D'Albertis. The castle is now home to the Museum of World Cultures. His natural history specimens from New Guinea are in the Natural History Museum of Giacomo Doria in Genoa.\n\nLater colonial administrators of British New Guinea such as Peter Scratchley, William MacGregor and John Hubert Plunkett Murray were critical of the methods employed by D'Albertis. Although these directors themselves engaged in various repressive and punitive policies against the native peoples, they recognised that the techniques of D'Albertis were very harmful in facilitating British colonisation. Andrew Goldie, an early British prospector to New Guinea, described an incident at a dinner in Sydney with D'Albertis where after having a steak accidentally thrown at him, the Italian \"foamed with rage\" and standing up in the restaurant with a bottle in his hand threatened to smash the skull of whoever owned up to being the thrower.\n\nD'Albertis however was not the first or last to implement such irresponsible plundering actions on the Fly and nearby rivers. Captain Blackwood, in 1846, of the H.M.S. Fly (after which the river is named) engaged in unapologetic raiding of villages on the river, including bombardment their houses. Also, a few years after D'Albertis' voyages, Captain John Strachan made an expedition up the nearby Mai Kussa river which was even more destructive than the Italian's. Strachan, who seems to have been in a chronic state of irrational paranoia and insomnia, improvised a torpedo-like weapon against a convey of native canoes causing a large amount of damage and casualties. In a high state of anxiety, Strachan later had to abandon his vessel and return to the coast on foot, committing massacres of indigenous people along the way. Strachan was later accused of being a \"red-handed murderer who had tramped knee-deep in blood through New Guinea\". He applied for protection from Lord Derby and subsequently no charges were laid.\n\nA number of reptile species from New Guinea were named in honour of d'Albertis, but most have subsequently become synonyms of other species.\nOnly the python carries d’Albertis’ name today.\n\nSeveral of these species were described by the German naturalist Wilhelm Peters and Giacomo Doria, the Italian naturalist and founder of the Natural History Museum of Giacomo Doria.\n\nOnly \"Leiopython albertisii\" (the white-lipped python) is currently recognised as a valid species, the other three reptiles being synonymised within species described earlier, ironically two of which were described by entomologist Sir William John Macleay whose rival expedition on the \"Chevert\", was also collecting specimens in southern Papua.\n\n\n\n"}

It was originally given by Kazuhiko Nishijima and Tadao Nakano in 1953, and led to the proposal of strangeness as a concept, which Nishijima originally called \"eta-charge\" after the eta meson. Murray Gell-Mann proposed the formula independently in 1956. The modern version of the formula relates all flavour quantum numbers (isospin up and down, strangeness, charm, bottomness, and topness) with the baryon number and the electric charge.\n\nThe original form of the Gell-Mann–Nishijima formula is:\n\nThis equation was originally based on empirical experiments.

{"id": "2147811", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2147811", "title": "Durango, Biscay", "text": "Durango, Biscay\n\nDurango is a town and municipality of the historical territory and province of Biscay, located in the Basque Country, Spain. It is the main town of Durangaldea, one of the \"comarcas\" of Biscay. Because of its economical activities and population, Durango is considered one of the largest towns in Biscay after the ones that compose the conurbation of Greater Bilbao.\n\nDurango has 29,318 inhabitants (2017). The town is crossed by three rivers (as illustrated in the town symbol). The Ibaizabal river is the main river, and lies in the middle of its wide valley, with the Urkiola mountain range and natural park to the south. The most important peak is the majestic Anboto ( in elevation). In addition, inside the town two mountains stand out: Pagasarri mountain (838 m) and mugarra mountain (453 m).\n\nThere are many differing opinions about the origin of the name Durango. Basque linguist Alfonso Irigoyen has suggested its origin to be in the name \"Duranco\", probably used in the early Middle Ages. Other authors suggest the name to be a derivation of \"Urazango\" or an evolved form of \"Padurango\". The Royal Basque Academy of the Language postulates that the name \"Durango\" stems from the Latin name \"Turanicus\", possibly a Roman \"fundus\" like many others in the Basque Country (cf. Kuartango). In the confirmation of the town's fuero it is referred to as \"Tavira de Durango\"; Tavira was probably the primitive name of the settlement and Durango the name of the region surrounding it. Until the 16th century, the town was known as Uribarri de Durango, \"Uribarri\" being Basque for \"New town\".\n\nWhile it is not known when Durango was exactly founded, it was subject to the Kingdom of Navarre, and is attested on an 1179 document revolving around territorial litigation between Alfonso VIII of Castile and Sancho VI of Navarre, \"The Wise\" (1150–1194). The impending threat of a military intervention conducted by King Alfonso VIII against the Navarrese led King Sancho VI to found other fortified towns, such as San Sebastián and Vitoria-Gasteiz (1181). Between 1199 and 1201, King Alfonso VIII of Castile finally occupied the lordship of Durango and its hinterland, as well as other key western Basque districts (Álava, Gipuzkoa). Durango went on to form part of the Crown of Castile, but former laws and institutions were upheld by the Castilian king.\n\nIn the 15th century, Durango got engaged in the wider War of the Bands, with various conflicts involving the Ibarguen, Zaldibar and Unzueta families. During this period, tower houses belonging to different clans were erected, such as the ones of Arandoño, Asteiza, Etxebarria, Lariz, Monago, and Otalora. Henry III (1393) and Henry IV (1457), the Castilian Kings, were both received in Durango, as well as Queen Isabel of Castile [\"The Catholic\"] (1483), who enticed Durango and the Lordship of Biscay to her cause in exchange for ratifying their laws and institutions, i.e. she swore the \"fueros\", and favourable trade conditions. According to the municipal records, both monarchs took shelter in the Lariz Tower.\n\nIn 1517 Durango was devastated by a terrible epidemic of plague that caused many deaths amongst the inhabitants. Some years after the epidemic, in 1544, heavy flooding inundated a good part of the town. Just the opposite, in 1554 the town was ravaged by fire, burning all wooden buildings to the ground, i.e. virtually all the buildings were burnt down. In 1597 another plague epidemic spread across the town. The Town Hall is recorded to have been built in the 16th century.\n\nThe name Durango was used by \"conquistadores\" like Francisco de Ibarra to found more Durangos in America named after the Basque original one, e.g. a state in Mexico called Durango, whose principal city is called Durango.\n\nDuring the 17th century, the town of Durango had to face up to the enormous human and economic cost incurred on the various wars the Crown of Castile embarked upon against France. Following heavy human losses suffered in battles and an episode of cholera epidemic, the town ended up virtually ruined.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, exactly in 1882, the railway line from Bilbao to Durango was inaugurated. While the construction was expensive, during the early 20th century Durango flourished.\n\nOn 31 March 1937, Durango was bombed by the Aviazione Legionaria and the Legion Condor. It was a busy shopping day—St. Maria, the central church (now a basilica) with a covered marketplace, was targeted. More than 500 people were killed in the bombing and the following days.\n\n\nThere is less heavy industry in the town than in the late 20th century, as it is being replaced by high density housing projects and shopping facilities.\n\nDurango was for many years the home of Euskal Telebista. This public television company broadcasts in Basque and Spanish. It also has a global presence with satellite channel beamed across the world. ETB has moved to a new headquarters in Bilbao.\n\nIn Durango, besides Spanish, the Biscayan variety (bizkaiera) of Basque is spoken, with the characteristics of the region.\n\nMunicipal Elections 2011: \n\n\nMunicipal Elections 2015: \n\n\nMunicipal Elections 2019: \n\n\nEvery half an hour there is a BizkaiBus bus service to Bilbao. There are two routes, one via the AP-8 motorway which takes about 30 minutes. This bus runs on the hour. The other slower crosscountry route stops in all towns and takes about 50 mins. There is also a once an hour bus to Eibar, a neighbouring town of a similar size to Durango.\n\nBuses also run to a variety of coastal villages, such as Ondarroa and Lekeitio (from Iurreta, a neighbouring village part of the Durango conurbation). There are direct buses to Vitoria-Gasteiz and Donostia-San Sebastián.\n\nTrains (from EuskoTren company) are narrow gauge and run on a single track. Durango was cut in two by the railway and seven level crossings caused traffic delays.\n\n7 years after construction began, Bilbao – San Sebastian EuskoTren services started using the new 4 km tunnel beneath the town of Durango on December 17. The €232m project was funded by the Basque government and included the construction of an underground station in the town centre. It allowed for the closure of the original line, which cut through the centre of the town.\n\nThe tunnel opened in 2012, 130 years to the day after the first train from Bilbao arrived in Durango, and is a key part of the upgrading of the Bilbao – San Sebastian line, which includes 15 km of track-doubling, elimination of 27 level crossings, and construction of new stations at Euba, Durango and Traña.\n\nTrains run to Bilbao-Atxuri station and Donostia and it is possible to get to Gernika and Bermeo also with a train change at Amorebieta.\n\nDurango has two sister cities.:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2147828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2147828", "title": "History of the University of Michigan", "text": "History of the University of Michigan\n\nThe history of the University of Michigan (UM) began with its establishment on August 26, 1817 as the Catholepistemiad or University of Michigania. The school moved from Detroit to Ann Arbor in 1837, on land offered to the university by the city. The first classes were held in 1841, and eleven men graduated in the first commencement ceremony in 1845. Although the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan was formed as a new legal entity in 1837, the Michigan Supreme Court ruled in 1856 that it was legally continuous with the Board of Trustees of the University of Michigan that was formed in 1821, and with the Catholepistemiad, or University, of Michigania that was formed in 1817.\n\nThe University of Michigan has since expanded to become one of the top universities in the United States, with one of the largest research expenditures of any American university as well as one of the largest number of living alumni at 526,000. The university is also recognized for its history of student activism and was the first American university to use the seminar method of study. It was also the location chosen by President John F. Kennedy to propose the concept of what became the Peace Corps, an intimate visit by Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1962 that was beautifully photographed, and the site of Lyndon B. Johnson's speech outlining his Great Society program. In 2003, the university successfully affirmed before the U.S. Supreme Court that consideration of race as a factor in admissions to universities was constitutional. However, Michigan voters approved restrictions on affirmative action in public universities and governmental hiring in November 2006, forcing Michigan to cease using race and gender as admissions criteria.\n\nShortly after the Territory of Michigan was formed in 1805, several of its leading citizens recognized the need for a public education system. As early as 1806, Father Gabriel Richard, who ran several schools around Detroit, had requested land for a college from the governor and judges appointed by the President to administer the territory. Governor William Hull and Chief Justice Augustus B. Woodward passed an act in 1809 to establish public school districts, but this early attempt came to little. Woodward harbored a dream of classifying all human knowledge (which he termed \"encathol epistemia\"), and discussed the subject with his friend and mentor Thomas Jefferson at Monticello in 1814.\n\nIn 1817, Woodward drafted a territorial act establishing a \"Catholepistemiad, or University, of Michigania,\" organized into thirteen different professorships, or \"didaxiim\", following the classification system he had published the year before in his \"A System of Universal Science\". He invented names for these using a mix of Greek and Latin so they could be \"engrafted, without variation, into every modern language\": \"Anthropoglossica\" (Literature), \"Mathematica\" (Mathematics), \"Physiognostica\" (Natural History), \"Physiosophica\" (Natural Philosophy), \"Astronomia\" (Astronomy), \"Chymia\" (Chemistry), \"Iatrica\" (Medicine), \"Œconomica\" (Economical Sciences), \"Ethica\" (Ethics), \"Polemitactica\" (Military Science), \"Diëgetica\" (Historical Sciences), \"Ennœica\" (Intellectual Sciences), and \"Catholepistemia\" (Universal Science).\n\nThe \"Didactor\" (professor) of Catholepistemia was to be the President, and the Didactor of Ennœica the Vice-President. Under the act, the Didactors exercised control over not only the university itself, but education in the territory in general, with the authority to \"establish colleges, academies, schools, libraries, museums, atheneums, botanical gardens, laboratories, and other useful literary and scientific institutions consonant to the laws of the United States and of Michigan, and provide for and appoint Directors, Visitors, Curators, Librarians, Instructors and Instructrixes among and throughout the various counties, cities, towns, townships, or other geographical divisions of Michigan.\"\n\nThe act was signed into law August 26, 1817, by Woodward, Judge John Griffin, and acting governor William Woodbridge (Governor Lewis Cass was absent on a trip with President Monroe). Father Richard was granted six didaxiim (and the Vice-Presidency), and the Rev. John Monteith, who had moved to Detroit a year earlier after graduating from Princeton Theological Seminary, was granted seven (and the Presidency).\n\nWhen it came to funding the project, Woodward being a Freemason himself looked to Zion Lodge No. 1 of Detroit for financial support. On September 15, 1817 Zion Lodge met and subscribed the sum of $250 in aid of the university, payable in the sum of $50 per year. Of the total amount subscribed to start the university two-thirds came from Zion Lodge and its members.\n\nThe cornerstone of the university's first building, near the corner of Bates St. and Congress St. in Detroit, was laid on September 24, 1817, and within a year both a primary school and a classical academy were functioning within it.\n\nFive days after the laying of the cornerstone, the Treaty of Fort Meigs was signed between the United States and various Native American tribes. Among its provisions was the ceding of of land by the Chippewa, Ottawa, and Potawatomi tribes to the \"college at Detroit\" for either use or sale, and an equal amount to St. Anne's Church in Detroit, where Father Richard was rector. No college had officially been created yet, so the next month Monteith and Richard decreed the creation of the \"First College of Michigania\" at Detroit. Despite this decree, no college was organized, and instruction remained limited to the existing primary school and academy.\n\nThe land granted to the college and the church was of two parts, one consisting of three sections near Macon, Michigan and one consisting of three sections to be selected later, with the college and church each having one-half interest in each section. These latter sections were not selected until 1821, and the university received legal title to them in 1824. In 1826, the university swapped its interest in the land at Macon for the church's interest in the others. Though evidence is scant, one historian believes that the land was later sold and the proceeds used in the running of the operation in Detroit.\n\nThe University of Michigan was sued in 1971 by descendants of the tribes who claimed that the land grant should have been held in trust, with the proceeds used to provide for their education. The court ruled in favor of the university, saying the lands were given as an outright gift (due in part to the tribes' affection for Father Richard), and the Michigan Court of Appeals upheld the ruling in 1981.\n\nThe unwieldy name of the Catholepistemiad and its constituent departments made it a target of ridicule. Governor Cass referred to it as the \"Cathole-what's its name\" and thought it a \"pedantic and uncouth name,\" while Justice James V. Campbell said it was \"neither Greek, Latin, nor English, [but merely] a piece of language gone mad.\" On April 30, 1821, Governor Cass and Judges Griffin and James Witherell passed a new act that changed the name of the institution to the University of Michigan and put control in the hands of a Board of Trustees consisting of 20 members plus the governor, with few other changes to its structure. Rev. Monteith, his office of President abolished, was appointed to the Board of Trustees, but left that summer to accept a professorship at Hamilton College. Father Richard was also appointed to the board and remained on it until his death in 1832.\n\nThe Trustees continued to oversee operation of the primary school and academy in Detroit and Grand Blanc, at one point reaching an enrollment of 200, but did not establish any additional schools, so the university continued to be one in name only. By 1827, neither school was operating, and the building in Detroit was leased to private teachers. Except as a legal entity, the University of Michigan had essentially ceased to exist.\n\nIn preparation for statehood, Michigan held a constitutional convention in 1835, although actual statehood was withheld by Congress until 1837, after the resolution of the so-called \"Toledo War\" with Ohio. Sarah Austin's English translation of Victor Cousin's \"Report on the State of Public Instruction in Prussia\" had just gained widespread attention, and thanks to its influence on two men, John Davis Pierce and Isaac Edwin Crary, the Michigan Constitution of 1835 was the first state constitution in the country to embrace the Prussian model of education, in which a complete system of primary schools, secondary schools, and a university are all administered by the state and supported with tax dollars. The constitution created the office of Superintendent of Public Instruction, and Governor Stevens T. Mason appointed Pierce to the post.\n\nThe Organic Act of March 18, 1837, created the University of Michigan, governed by a Board of Regents consisting of 12 members appointed by the Governor with the consent of the Senate, along with the Governor himself, the Lieutenant Governor, the Justices of the Michigan Supreme Court, and the Chancellor of the state. It also created the office of Chancellor of the University, who was to be appointed by the Regents and serve as ex officio President of the Board. In practice, however, the Regents never appointed a Chancellor, instead leaving administrative duties up to a rotating roster of professors, and the Governor chaired the board himself.\n\nA group of businessmen called the Ann Arbor Land Company had set land aside in the village of Ann Arbor, trying to win a bid for a new state capital. When that did not happen, they offered it for sale to the state for use by the university. A second act passed two days after the Organic Act called for the University to be established in Ann Arbor, and directed the Regents to secure a site. The Board of Regents held its first meeting in Ann Arbor on June 5, 1837. At this meeting they chose 40 acres on the farm of Henry Rumsey as the new site for the university.\n\nThe first classes were held in 1841; six freshmen and a sophomore were taught by two professors. Eleven men graduated in the first commencement ceremony in 1845.\n\nA new state constitution was adopted in 1850, with two significant changes related to the university. The office of Regent was changed from an appointed one to an elected one, and the office of President of the University of Michigan was created, with the Regents directed to select one. In 1852, they chose Henry Philip Tappan as the university's first president.\n\nTappan modeled UM's curriculum on the broad range of subjects taught at German universities (the so-called \"research model\"), rather than the classical models (the so-called \"recitation model\"). The German, or Humboldtian model, was conceived by Wilhelm von Humboldt and based on Friedrich Schleiermacher’s liberal ideas pertaining to the importance of freedom, seminars, and laboratories in universities. To that end, Tappan enlarged the library, and supported the development and establishment of laboratories, an art gallery, and the Detroit Observatory. However, Tappan was dismissed in 1863 over conflicts with the Board of Regents concerning matters of policy and personality.\n\nThe Medical School was founded in 1848, and graduated 90 physicians in 1852. UM opened the first university-owned hospital in the U.S. in 1869. The first student newspaper, \"The Peninsular Phoenix and Gazetteer\", was founded in 1857, which was followed by the biweekly \"University Chronicle\" in 1867 and \"The Michigan Daily\" in 1890.\n\nBy 1865 to 1866, the university's enrollment increased to 1,205 students, with many of the new enrollees veterans of the Civil War. In the July 1866 issue of \"The Atlantic Monthly\", Harvard University Professor F.H. Hedge depicted UM as the model public institution of higher education for the growing nation. UM began to draw students from across the United States and abroad, and its student body included African Americans. More than 520 of the students enrolled in 1867 were studying at the Medical School. Also in 1867, maize and blue were voted class colors; the Board of Regents made them the official colors of the UM in 1912.\n\nThe university's first known African American student, Samuel Codes Watson, was admitted as a medical student in 1853; the first female student, Madelon Louisa Stockwell (lit. 1872) of Kalamazoo, Michigan, was admitted in 1870, and the first known African American woman admitted was Mary Henrietta Graham, in 1876 (lit. 1880). By 1882, UM's alumnae included the president of Wellesley College, Alice Elvira Freeman Palmer. The growing student body also led to unruliness. In 1872, Ann Arbor hosted 49 saloons, and the spectacle of student intoxication and public donnybrooks concerned school administrators and state politicians. \"Harper's Weekly\" published an article in July 1887 that noted the school's \"broad and liberal spirit\" and the wide-ranging freedoms of its students.\n\nIn 1871, James B. Angell, president of the University of Vermont, was appointed president of UM, a position that he held until 1909. Angell aggressively expanded the university's curriculum to include and expand professional studies in dentistry, architecture, engineering, government, and medicine. In 1880, President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed Angell a special minister to China to negotiate the immigration of Chinese laborers. Angell's publicity efforts abroad eventually prompted a large influx of foreign students to the university. UM also began to attract renowned faculty, including pragmatist philosopher John Dewey, who taught at the university from 1884 to 1894, and Thomas M. Cooley, who left the university when he was appointed the first chairman of the Interstate Commerce Commission by President Grover Cleveland.\n\nUniversity President Marion LeRoy Burton's tenure, which started in 1920, saw the advent of major field research initiatives in Africa, South America, the South Pacific, and the Middle East. Burton raised admissions standards and sought to heighten the academic rigors of the university's courses, while taming the often-rowdy social lives of his students. Burton later made the nominating speech at the Republican National Convention for Governor Calvin Coolidge of Massachusetts for president in 1924. Shortly after attaining his place in the national spotlight, Burton died of a heart attack in February 1925. The memorial bell tower that bears his name remains a prominent campus landmark. Burton was succeeded by Clarence Cook Little, a highly divisive figure who, among other things, offended Roman Catholics with his vocal endorsements of contraception. \n\nThe 1930s saw a major crackdown on the consumption of alcohol and the rowdiness that had characterized student life practically from inception. In February 1931, local police raided five fraternities, finding liquor and arresting 79 students, including the captain of the football team and \"Michigan Daily\" editors. During the Great Depression, ritual and widespread freshman hazing all but ceased. Long known as a \"dressy campus,\" student attire became less formal. Fraternities and sororities became less prominent in student life, as their finances and memberships went into steep decline.\n\nUM's position as a prominent research university gained momentum in 1920 with a formal reorganization of the College of Engineering and the formation of an advisory committee of 100 industrialists to guide academic research initiatives. In addition, 1933 saw the completion of the new Law Quadrangle, a gift from alumnus William W. Cook. The quadrangle quickly became a campus landmark, known for its integration of residence and legal scholarship.\n\nIn 1943, Michigan was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission.\n\nDuring World War II, the university grew into a true research powerhouse, undertaking major initiatives on behalf of the U.S. Navy and contributing to weapons development with breakthroughs including the VT fuze, depth bombs, the PT boat, and radar jammers. By 1950, university enrollment had reached 21,000, of whom 7,700 were veterans supported by the G.I. Bill. In the same year, the university purchased of land north of the Huron River that would later become North Campus.\n\nIn 1948, Michigan's Institute for Social Research (ISR) was established by Rensis Likert. Harlan H. Hatcher, an administrator at Ohio State University and professor of English, was appointed university president in 1951. Hatcher fostered early construction in the school's nascent North Campus, and created an Honors College for 5% of entering freshmen. As the Cold War and the Space Race took shape, UM became a principal recipient of government research grants, and its researchers were on the vanguard of exploring peacetime uses for atomic power. During Hatcher's administration, the ISR, with its ambitious ongoing effort focused on research and applications of social science, received its own building. In a 1966 report by the American Council on Education, the university was rated first or second in the nation in graduate teaching of all 28 disciplines surveyed. In 1971, the central library on campus was named the Harlan Hatcher Graduate Library.\n\nThe beginning of Hatcher's presidency saw the university in the national spotlight over the first-ever \"panty raid\" in 1952, an event cheered on by hundreds of students and chronicled by the national press, including \"Life Magazine\". Hatcher's legacy is marked, however, by a much more serious controversy: his suspension of three faculty members—Chandler Davis, Clement Markert, and Mark Nicholson—under pressure from Rep. Kit Clardy and his subcommittee of the House Committee on Un-American Activities. Davis ultimately was sentenced to prison for contempt, a conviction that he appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nDuring the 1960s, numerous UM faculty members served in the administrations of presidents Lyndon Johnson and John F. Kennedy. During their administrations, 15 alumni served in the Senate and House of Representatives. On October 14, 1960, Kennedy, who once referred to Harvard as \"The Michigan of the East,\" announced his intention to form the Peace Corps in a speech on the steps of the Michigan Union, and by 1966 332 UM alumni were serving in the Corps. In a commencement address at Michigan Stadium on May 22, 1964, President Johnson first announced his intentions to pursue his Great Society reforms.\n\nAn enduring legacy of the 1960s was the sharp rise in campus activism. The campus tumult of the 1960s was to some extent foreshadowed during World War I, when disputes arose between faculty, administrators, and students over issues including military instruction and teaching of the German language. In the 1930s, student groups had formed to promote socialism, labor, isolationism, and pacifism, as well as interest in the Spanish Civil War. Political dissent, largely mollified by campus consensus during World War II, returned to UM with a vengeance during the Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War. \n\nOn November 5, 1962, Martin Luther King Jr. delivered two speeches to capacity crowds in Hill Auditorium and also participated in an intimate student discussion and faculty dinner reception at the Michigan Union. “The American dream is as yet unfulfilled,” he said, in his only known visit to Ann Arbor.\n\nOn March 24, 1964, a group of faculty held the nation's first \"teach-in\" to protest American policy in Southeast Asia. 2,500 students attended the event. A series of 1966 sit-ins by Voice, the campus political party of Students for a Democratic Society, prompted the administration to ban sit-ins, a move that, in turn, led 1,500 students to conduct a one-hour sit-in in the administration building. In September 1969, a 12,000-student march followed a Michigan football game; on October 15, 1969, 20,000 rallied against the war in Michigan Stadium. Radicals adopted increasingly confrontational tactics, including an episode in which members of the Jesse James Gang, an SDS offshoot, locked themselves in a room with an on-campus military recruiter and refused to release him. Hatcher's successor, Robben Wright Fleming—an experienced labor negotiator and former chancellor of the University of Wisconsin–Madison—is credited by university historian Howard Peckham with preventing the campus from experiencing the violent outbreaks seen at other American universities.\n\nLow minority enrollment was also a cause of unrest. In March 1970, the Black Action Movement, an umbrella name for a coalition of student groups, sponsored a campus-wide strike to protest low minority enrollment and to build support for an African American Studies department. The strike included picket lines that prevented entrance to university buildings and was widely observed by students and faculty. Eight days after the strike began, the university granted many of BAM's demands.\n\nCampus activism also changed the character of student social life. By 1973, only 4.7% of the student body participated in fraternities and sororities. The university's student government fell one vote short of approving a marijuana co-op that was based on the premise of high-quantity purchases and free distribution. Such attitudes persist in the Hash Bash, a rally and festival calling for the legalization of marijuana use held annually on and near campus.\nDuring the 1970s, severe budget constraints hindered to some extent the university's physical development and academic standing. For the previous 50 years, all major academic surveys had listed Michigan as one of the nation's top five universities, a standing that began to diminish. For instance, the student-faculty ratio at the U-M Law School became the highest of any elite law school in the U.S. Though the undergraduate division is currently ranked in the top 25, the university is acknowledged to have a faculty whose teaching awards, publications, patents and citations generally rank in the top five in the U.S.\n\nThe university's financial condition improved under the leadership of President Harold Shapiro, a former economics professor, during the 1980s. The university again saw a surge in funds devoted to research in the social and physical sciences, although campus controversy arose over involvement in the anti-missile Strategic Defense Initiative and investments in South Africa. A new hospital complex was opened in 1986, including a new University Hospital and the A. Alfred Taubman Health Care Center that centralized outpatient care provided by the Medical School faculty. Also in 1986, UM launched M-CARE, a managed care health plan that provided HMO coverage and other plans to university faculty and staff, retirees, dependents, and to employers in the community.\n\nPresident James Duderstadt, whose tenure ran from 1988 to 1995, was a nuclear engineer and former engineering dean who emphasized uses for computer and information technology. Duderstadt facilitated achievements in the campus's physical growth and fundraising efforts. His successor, Lee Bollinger, had a relatively brief tenure before departing to lead Columbia University. Two major construction initiatives in the late 1990s were (1) the University of Michigan School of Social Work building constructing a brand new dedicated building on the corner of South and East University. and (2) Tisch Hall addition to Angell Hall, named in honor of a $6M gift from mall developer Preston Robert Tisch.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the UM faced declining state funding as a percentage of its funding due to state budget shortfalls. At the same time, UM has attempted to maintain its high academic standing while keeping tuition costs affordable. The university administration also faced labor disputes with labor unions, notably with the Lecturers' Employees Organization (LEO) and the Graduate Employees Organization (GEO), the union representing graduate student employees.\n\nIn 2003, two lawsuits involving the school's affirmative action admissions policy reached the U.S. Supreme Court (Grutter v. Bollinger and Gratz v. Bollinger). President George W. Bush took the unusual step of publicly opposing the policy before the court issued a ruling, though the eventual ruling was mixed. In the first case, the court upheld the Law School admissions policy while in the second, it ruled against the university's undergraduate admissions policy.\n\nThe debate still continues, however, because in November 2006 Michigan voters passed proposal 2, banning most affirmative action in university admissions. Under that law race, gender, and national origin can no longer be considered in admissions. UM and other organizations were granted a stay from implementation of the passed proposal soon after that election, and this has allowed time for proponents of affirmative action to decide legal and constitutional options in response to the election results. The university has stated it plans to continue to challenge the ruling; in the meantime, the admissions office states that it will attempt to achieve a diverse student body by looking at other factors such as whether the student attended a disadvantaged school, and the level of education of the student's parents.\n\nIn late 2006, with the climate for health plans changing rapidly throughout the region and the U.S., the university made the decision to sell M-CARE to Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan and its Blue Care Network subsidiary. As part of the sale, a new health care quality organization called Michigan HealthQuarters was founded.\n\nThe Ann Arbor campus originally started on of land bounded by State Street on the west, North University Avenue on the north, East University Avenue on the east, and South University Avenue on the south.\n\nThe first two decades of the 20th century saw a construction boom on campus that included facilities to house the dental and pharmacy programs, a chemistry building, a building for the study of natural sciences, the Martha Cook Building and Helen Newberry residence halls, Hill Auditorium, and large hospital and library complexes. University President Burton continued the construction boom through the 1920s, including the construction of Michigan Stadium. In 1925, The University Hospital (also known as the Main Hospital) replaced the Catherine Street Hospital. Designed by Albert Kahn, the 893-bed hospital was the largest and most modern facility of its kind in the nation, and was used until 1986. Land for North Campus, which would house the College of Engineering, the School of Music, and the A. Alfred Taubman College of Architecture & Urban Planning was purchased in 1950.\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, the university devoted substantial resources to renovating its massive hospital complex and improving the academic facilities on the university's North Campus. At a time when many other universities were choosing to sell their hospitals and clinics, UM created a tighter bond between its Medical School and its Hospitals & Health Centers unit in 1997, forming the University of Michigan Health System to act as an \"umbrella\" over those entities and M-CARE, and designating an Executive Vice President for Medical Affairs who reports directly to the President. The result has been a financially strong and synergistic system for health care delivery, research and medical/bioscience education.\n\nNevertheless, in the past decade roughly $2.5 billion has been budgeted and expended toward such construction, with approximately another $4.8 billion in construction projects in 17 new buildings underway or in planning for the coming decade. Recently, the university has constructed over 1 million square feet (90,000 m²) of academic and laboratory space devoted to the life sciences. In 2005, the university unveiled a development master-plan for the medical campus that is expected to add 3 million square feet (270,000 m²) to the existing 5 million square feet (450,000 m²). Examples of new buildings include the Cardiovascular Center, the Biomedical Science Research Building, the Rachel Upjohn Building and the replacement for C.S. Mott Children's Hospital and Women's Hospital, scheduled to open in 2011.\n\nThe Ann Arbor campus is divided into four main areas: the North, Central, Medical, and South Campuses. The physical infrastructure includes more than 500 major buildings, with a combined area of more than 31 million square feet (712 acres or 2.38 km²). The campus also consists of leased space in buildings scattered throughout the city, many occupied by organizations affiliated with the University of Michigan Health System. An East Medical Campus has recently been developed on Plymouth Road, with several university-owned buildings for outpatient care, diagnostics, and outpatient surgery. The university also has an office building called Wolverine Tower in southern Ann Arbor near Briarwood Mall. Another major facility is the Matthaei Botanical Gardens, which is located on the eastern outskirts of Ann Arbor.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2147857", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2147857", "title": "Norah Lofts", "text": "Norah Lofts\n\nNorah Lofts, \"née\" Norah Ethel Robinson, (27 August 190410 September 1983) was a 20th-century best-selling British author. She wrote more than fifty books specialising in historical fiction, but she also wrote non-fiction and short stories. Many of her novels, including her Suffolk Trilogy, follow the history of specific houses and their residents over several generations.\n\nLofts was born in Shipdham, Norfolk in England, and died in 1983 in Bury St Edmunds. She also wrote under the pen names Peter Curtis and Juliet Astley. Lofts chose to release her murder-mystery novels under the pen name Peter Curtis because she did not want the readers of her historic fiction to pick up a murder-mystery novel and expect classic Lofts historical fiction. However, the murders still show characteristic Lofts elements. Most of her historical novels fall into two general categories: biographical novels about queens, among them Anne Boleyn, Isabella I of Castile, and Catherine of Aragon; and novels set in East Anglia centered around the fictitious town of Baildon (patterned largely on Bury St. Edmunds). Her creation of this fictitious area of England is reminiscent of Thomas Hardy's creation of \"Wessex\"; and her use of recurring characters such that the protagonist of one novel appears as a secondary character in others is even more reminiscent of William Faulkner's work set in \"Yoknapatawpha County,\" Mississippi. Lofts' work set in East Anglia in the 1930s and 1940s shows great concern with the very poor in society and their inability to change their conditions. Her approach suggests an interest in the social reformism that became a feature of British post-war society.\n\nShe was not afraid to tackle potentially sensitive subjects; her version of the Nativity, with backstories of Mary, Joseph, the Magi, the shepherds - even the innkeeper - is rendered in \"How Far To Bethlehem?\" as is the ill-fated Donner Party expedition in \"Road to Revelation\" (aka \"Winter Harvest\").\n\nSeveral of her novels were turned into films. \"Jassy\" was filmed as \"Jassy\" (1947) starring Margaret Lockwood and Dennis Price. \"You're Best Alone\" was filmed as \"Guilt Is My Shadow\" (1950). \"The Devil's Own\" (also known as \"The Little Wax Doll\" and \"Catch As Catch Can\") was filmed as \"The Witches\" (1966). The film \"7 Women\" (1966) was directed by John Ford and very loosely based on the story \"Chinese Finale\" by Norah Lofts.\nHer books still have a devoted international readership, notably on the Goodreads website.\n\nIn the United States, she won a National Book Award for \"I Met a Gypsy\", voted by members of the American Booksellers Association. Specifically, her collection was \"the 'forgotten book' of the year [1936] that least deserved to be forgotten\" (subsequently termed the Bookseller Discovery). Alfred Knopf represented her at the ceremony.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The blueprints for the new airport and container port had already been drawn. However, the government decided to postpone the plan owing to the uncertainty of Hong Kong's future.\n\nAfter the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the government reproposed the plan in order to restore confidence among Hong Kong's populace. It presented a rosy picture for the future to the Hong Kong people in order to halt the wave of emigration. \n\n\nThe government of People's Republic of China (PRC) cast a great concern in the project for fear that the British would withdraw the monetary reserve of Hong Kong to Britain before the reunification with China 1997.

It gained historical significance on November 22, 1963, as the location of Lee Harvey Oswald's arrest over the suspicion he was the killer of Dallas Police Officer J. D. Tippit. Today, it hosts a mix of repertory cinema and special events.\n\nWhen first opened, fittingly on the anniversary day of Texas independence in 1931, the Texas Theatre was the largest suburban movie theater in Dallas and was part of a chain of theaters financed by Howard Hughes. It was the first theater in Dallas with air conditioning and featured many state-of-the-art luxuries.\n\nThe theater is most famous for being the site of Lee Harvey Oswald's arrest on November 22, 1963. Warren \"Butch\" Burroughs, manager, and concession stand attendee the afternoon of Oswald's arrest said that Oswald came into the theater between 1:00 and 1:07 pm. Burroughs further claimed he sold Oswald popcorn at 1:15 p.m. Julie Postal, the ticket seller, who was posted out in front of the entrance told the Warren Commission that Burroughs initially told her the same thing, although Burroughs later denied this. Julia Postal, however never saw the man enter the theater, relying on another's account, which according to the official governments report, happened at a later time. Texas Theatre patron, Jack Davis, also corroborated Burroughs' time, claiming he observed Oswald in the theatre prior to 1:20 pm. The films presented that day were \"Cry of Battle\" and \"War Is Hell\", which Oswald briefly viewed.\n\nAs a commemoration of the historic capture, the words \"Lee Harvey Oswald, November 22, 1963\" were later inscribed in gold paint on the chair Oswald (supposedly) occupied — three rows from the rear, five seats from the aisle. However, the actual chair was removed by then manager \"Butch\" Burroughs, who took it home and replaced it with another which the FBI confiscated the next day for evidence thinking it was the original Oswald seat.\n\nThe theater closed in 1989 and the Texas Theatre Historical Society (TTHS) purchased it the following year. This allowed Oliver Stone to remodel the exterior façade for his 1991 film, \"JFK\". However, by 1992, the Society was no longer able to fund the property and the theater closed again. Former usher and sign changer Don Dubois of Texas Rosewin-Midway Properties saved the theater from the wrecking ball in 1993, but two years later, it was nearly destroyed by a five-alarm fire, forcing another closure. In 1996, Pedro Villa stepped in to rescue the theater from another plan which would have demolished the structure and replaced it with a furniture warehouse. However, he was unable to obtain financing to restore the theater and it defaulted to Texas Rosewin-Midway Properties. The fire-damaged building remained vacant for three years, open to vandals, stray animals, and the elements.\n\nIn 2001, the Oak Cliff Foundation acquired the structure and began renovations after receiving $1.6 million from the Dallas Neighborhood Renaissance Partnership. Since then, the board of the Oak Cliff Foundation has raised an additional $2 million of the estimated $9 million needed for the complete renovation of the theater. The foundation used the funds to secure and restore the building needed after years of neglect and fire damage and the venue began hosting movies and special events soon after.\n\nIn September 2010, Aviation Cinemas, Inc. signed a lease to operate the theater as an independent and repertory cinema with hopes of presenting live theatre and concerts in the future.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2147925", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2147925", "title": "Dragée", "text": "Dragée\n\nA dragée ( ) is a French bite-sized form of confectionery with a hard outer shell—which is often used for another purpose (e.g. decorative, symbolic, medicinal, etc.) in addition to consumption.\n\nA classic form of dragée and comfit, Jordan almonds, also known as mlabas (ملبس, lit. \"coated\" or \"covered\") in Arabic, sugared almonds\", \"confetti, or koufeta consist of almonds which are sugar panned in various pastel colors.\n\nJordan almonds are often used as wedding favors—like the Italian \"Bomboniere\"—with the \"bitter\" almonds and the \"sweet\" sugar symbolizing the bitterness of life and sweetness of love. The treats are often packaged in groups of five to represent happiness, health, longevity, wealth, and fertility. At Italian and Greek weddings, the almonds are placed in groups of five, an odd number that is indivisible to symbolize the unity of husband and wife. In the Middle East, Jordan almonds are considered an aphrodisiac so there are always plenty on hand for the newlyweds and their guests.\n\nJordan almonds are thought to originate in ancient Rome, where honey-covered almonds were introduced by a Roman baker and confectioner named Julius Dragatus. His confections were called dragati and were served by nobility at weddings and births. When sugar became more readily available in the 15th century, the nuts were coated in sugar instead. In Sulmona, Italy, the technique of creating the dragée almonds was perfected by the Pelino family.\n\nThe term \"Jordan\" is most likely a corrupted version of the French word \"jardin\", meaning \"garden\", hence, a cultivated rather than wild almond. However, others suggest the term referred to a variety of almonds originally grown along the Jordan River characterized by long, thin, slender, rather smooth kernels in thick, heavy shells.\n\nStill others believe that \"Jordan\" is a corruption of the name of the town of Verdun in the northeast of France. In the 13th century, when the medieval crusaders brought sugar to Europe after their campaigns in the Holy Land, it was very valuable and considered medicinal. During that time, an apothecary in Verdun began coating other medicines with sugar (calling them dragées) to make them easier to take. The town of Verdun became very well known for its \"dragées de Verdun\".\n\nOther chocolate dragées with multi-colored candy shells include the M&M's, initially designed to allow easy transport and consumption of chocolate for the U.S. military, have evolved into a popular candy, but are also sold as decorative dragées in 25 different colors. \n\nUsed to increase tolerability of bitter medication or merely to compel consumption, medicated candies or sugar-coated pills can be referred to as dragées (e.g., Ayds was a popular weight loss candy in the 1980s).\n\nAnother form of dragée is a small sphere of sugar, in the Commonwealth often called \"cachous\", used primarily in the decoration of cookies, cakes, and other forms of bakery. These are produced in various sizes, typically in diameter. This is larger than nonpareils and smaller than large pearl tapioca.\n\nSilver dragées have long been used for both wedding and holiday food decoration. More recently, metallic gold, copper, rainbow colors (red, green, blue, etc.), and pearlescent colors have become available.\n\nIn most countries, including the United Kingdom and France, silver dragées are classified as food items. However, since 1906, US regulations have prohibited the manufacture or sale of any food that uses any metal or mineral substance, including silver, as a food coloring, coating, or additive. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration considers the metallic-finish sugar dragées to be inedible, and they may be sold only when accompanied with a notice that they are to be used for decorative purposes only. Almonds that have been coated the same way are not permitted at all. Although the metallic-finish dragées can be purchased in 49 US states, they are no longer sold in California due to lawsuits against sellers by a lawyer who believes that silver is a dangerous poison.\n\n\n"}

These five lavishly designed theaters were built by Loew's to establish its preeminence in film exhibition in the metropolitan New York City area and to serve as the chain's flagship venues, each in its own area. All five theaters are still standing. One operates as a community performing arts center; two are commercial live entertainment venues; and two are currently used as churches.\n\nParamount-Publix head Adolph Zukor acquired the successful Balaban and Katz theater chain in 1926. Partner Sam Katz would later run the Paramount-Publix theatre chain in New York City from the thirty-five story Paramount Theatre Building on Times Square.\n\nBalaban and Katz had developed the Wonder Theater concept, first publicized around 1918 in Chicago. The Chicago Theatre was created as an opulent theater with many amenities for its patrons and was advertised as a \"wonder theatre\". When Publix acquired the Balaban and Katz chain they embarked on a project to expand the wonder theaters, and started to build in New York in 1926. While Balaban and Publix were dominant in Chicago, Loew's was the major player in New York, and did not want Publix theaters to overshadow their own. The two companies brokered a non-competition deal for New York and Chicago, and Loew's took over the New York area projects, developing the five Loew's Wonder Theaters.

{"id": "2147935", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2147935", "title": "Greek Resistance", "text": "Greek Resistance\n\nThe Greek Resistance (, \"National Resistance\") is the blanket term for a number of armed and unarmed groups from across the political spectrum that resisted the Axis occupation of Greece in the period 1941–1944, during World War II. It is considered as one of the strongest resistance movements in Nazi-occupied Europe.\n\nThe rise of resistance movements in Greece was precipitated by the invasion and occupation of Greece by Nazi Germany (and its allies Italy and Bulgaria) from 1941–44. Italy led the way with its attempted invasion from Albania in 1940, which was repelled by the Greek Army. After the German invasion, the occupation of Athens and the fall of Crete, King George II and his government escaped to Egypt, where they proclaimed a government-in-exile, recognised by the Allies. The British actively encouraged, even coerced, the King to appoint centrist, moderate ministers; only two of his ministers were members of the dictatorial government that had governed Greece before the German invasion. Despite that some in the left-wing resistance claimed the government to be illegitimate, on account of its roots in the dictatorship of Ioannis Metaxas from 1936–41.\n\nThe Germans set up a Greek collaborationist government, headed by General Georgios Tsolakoglou, before entering Athens. Some high-profile officers of the pre-war Greek regime served the Germans in various posts. This government however, lacked legitimacy and support, being utterly dependent on the German and Italian occupation authorities, and discredited because of its inability to prevent the cession of much of Greek Macedonia and Western Thrace to Bulgaria. Both the collaborationist government and the occupation forces were further undermined due to their failure to prevent the outbreak of the Great Famine, with the mortality rate reaching a peak in the winter of 1941–42, which seriously harmed the Greek civilian population.\n\nAlthough there is an unconfirmed incident connected with Evzone Konstantinos Koukidis the day the Germans occupied Athens, the first confirmed resistance act in Greece had taken place on the night of 30 May 1941, even before the end of the Battle of Crete. Two young students, Apostolos Santas, a law student, and Manolis Glezos, a student at the Athens University of Economics and Business, secretly climbed the northwest face of the Acropolis and tore down the swastika banner which had been placed there by the occupation authorities.\n\nThe first wider resistance movements occurred in northern Greece, where the Bulgarians annexed Greek territories. The first mass uprising occurred around the town of Drama in eastern Macedonia, in the Bulgarian occupation zone. The Bulgarian authorities had initiated large-scale Bulgarization policies, causing the Greek population's reaction. During the night of 28–29 September 1941 the people of Drama and its outskirts rose up. This badly-organized revolt was suppressed by the Bulgarian Army, which retaliated executing over three thousand people in Drama alone. An estimated fifteen thousand Greeks were killed by the Bulgarian occupational army during the next few weeks and in the countryside entire villages were machine gunned and looted. The town of Doxato and the village of Choristi are officially considered today Martyr Cities.\n\nAt the same time, large demonstrations were organized in Greek Macedonian cities by the Defenders of Northern Greece (YVE), a right-wing organization, in protest against the Bulgarian annexation of Greek territories.\n\nArmed groups consisted of \"andartes - αντάρτες\" (\"guerillas\") first appeared in the mountains of Macedonia by October 1941, and the first armed clashes resulted in 488 civilians being murdered in reprisals by the Germans, which succeeded in severely limiting Resistance activity for the next few months. However, these harsh actions, together with the plundering of Greece's natural resources by the Germans, turned Greeks more against the occupiers.\n\nThe lack of a legitimate government and the inactivity of the established political class created a power vacuum and meant an absence of a rallying point for the Greek people. Most officers and citizens who wanted to continue the fight fled to the British-controlled Middle East, and those who remained behind were unsure of their prospects against the Wehrmacht. This situation resulted in the creation of several new groupings, where the pre-war establishment was largely absent, which assumed the role of resisting the occupation powers.\n\nThe first resistance groups started appearing a few months after the beginning of the occupation of Greece, such as the Grivas Military Organization, founded in June 1941, and the organization \"Freedom\", led by Colonel Dimitrios Psarros, founded in July 1941. Also, in June 1941, shortly after the end of the Battle of Crete, the organization \"Supreme Committee of Cretan Struggle\" (AEAK) was founded.\n\nThe first major resistance organization to be founded was the National Liberation Front (EAM), which by 1944 came to number more than 1,800,000 members (the Greek population was around 7,500,000 at that time). EAM was organized by the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) and other smaller parties, whereas the major pre-war political parties refused to participate either in EAM or in any other resistance movement. On February 16, 1942, EAM gave permission to a communist veteran, called Athanasios (Thanasis) Klaras (who adopted the \"nom de guerre\" Aris Velouchiotis) to examine the possibilities of an armed resistance movement. Although its foundation was announced in late 1941, there were no military acts until 1942, when the Greek People's Liberation Army (ELAS), the armed forces of EAM, was born.\n\nThe second largest organization was the Venizelist-oriented National Republican Greek League (EDES), led by a former army officer, Colonel Napoleon Zervas, with exiled republican General Nikolaos Plastiras as its nominal head.\n\nGreece is a mountainous country, with a long tradition in \"andartiko\" (αντάρτικο, \"guerrilla warfare\"), dating back to the days of the klephts (anti-Turkish bandits) of the Ottoman period, who often enjoyed folk-hero status. In the 1940s, the countryside was poor, the road network not very well developed, and state control outside the cities usually exercised by the Greek Gendarmerie. But by 1942, due to the weakness of the central government in Athens, the countryside was gradually slipping out of its control, while the Resistance groups had acquired a firm and wide-ranging organization, parallel and more effective than that of the official state.\n\nIn February 1942, EAM, an organization controlled by the local Communist Party formed a military corps, ELAS, that would first operate in the mountains of Central Greece, with Aris Velouchiotis, a communist activist, as their chief captain. Later, on 28 July 1942, a centrist ex-army officer, Colonel Napoleon Zervas, announced the foundation of the National Groups of Greek Guerrillas (EOEA), as EDES' military arm, to operate, at first, in the region of Aetolia-Acarnania. National and Social Liberation (EKKA) also formed a military corps, named after the famous 5/42 Evzone Regiment, under Col. Dimitrios Psarros, that was mainly localized in the area of Mount Giona.\n\nUntil the summer of 1942, the occupation authorities had been little troubled by the armed Resistance, which was still in its infancy. The Italians in particular, in control of most of the countryside, considered the situation to have been normalized. From that point, however, the Resistance gained pace, with EAM/ELAS in particular expanding rapidly. Armed groups attacked and disarmed local gendarmerie stations and isolated Italian outposts, or toured the villages and gave patriotic speeches. The Italians were forced to re-evaluate their assessment, and take such measures such as the deportation of army officers to camps in Italy and Germany, which naturally only encouraged the latter to join the underground \"en masse\" by escaping \"to the mountains\".\n\nThese developments emerged most dramatically as the Greek Resistance announced its presence to the world with one of the war's most spectacular sabotage acts, the blowing up of the Gorgopotamos railway bridge, linking northern and southern Greece, on 25 November 1942. This operation was the result of British mediation between ELAS and EDES (Operation \"Harling\"), carried out by 12 British Special Operations Executive (SOE) saboteurs and a joint ELAS-EDES force. This was the first and last time that the two major Resistance groups would cooperate, due to the rapidly developing rivalry and ideological retrenchment between them.\n\nNevertheless, constant attacks and acts of sabotage followed against the Italians, such as the Battle of Fardykampos, resulting in the capture of several hundred Italian soldiers and significant amounts of equipment. By the late spring of 1943, the Italians were forced to withdraw from several areas. The towns of Karditsa, Grevena, Trikkala, Metsovon and others were liberated by July. The Axis forces and their collaborators remained in control only of the main towns and the connecting roads, with the interior left to the \"andartes\". This was \"Free Greece\", stretching from the Ionian Sea to the Aegean and from the borders of the German zone in Macedonia to Boeotia, a territory of 30,000 km² and 750,000 inhabitants.\n\nBy this time (July 1943), the overall strength of the \"andartes\" was around 20-30,000, with most belonging to the ELAS, newly under the command of General Stefanos Sarafis. EDES was limited in operations to Epirus, and EKKA operated in a small area in Central Greece. The Italian capitulation in September 1943 provided a windfall for the Resistance, as the Italian Army in many places simply disintegrated. Most Italian troops were swiftly disarmed and interned by the Germans, but on Cephalonia the \"Acqui\" Division resisted for about a week (ELAS fighters joining them) before being forced to surrender and subsequently massacred. In many places significant amounts of weaponry and equipment, as well as men, fell into the hands of the Resistance. The most spectacular case was that of the \"Pinerolo\" division and the \"Lancieri di Aosta\" Cavalry Regiment, which went completely over to the EAMite \"andartes\".\n\nThe Germans now took over the Italian zone, and soon proved to be a totally different opponent from the demoralized, war-weary and far less brutal Italians. Already since the early summer of 1943, German troops had been pouring into Greece, fearing an Allied landing there (in fact falling victims to a grand-scale Allied strategic deception operation, \"Operation Barclay\"). Soon they became involved in wide-ranging counterguerrilla operations, which they carried out with great ruthlessness, based on their experiences in Yugoslavia. In the course of these operations, mass reprisals were carried out, resulting in war crimes such as at Kommeno on August 16, the Massacre of Kalavryta in December and the Massacre of Distomo in June 1944. At the same time, hundreds of villages were systematically torched and almost one million people left homeless.\n\nDespite the signing of an agreement in July 1943 between the three main Resistance groups (EAM/ELAS, EDES and EKKA) to cooperate and to subject themselves to the Allied Middle East High Command under General Wilson (the \"National Bands Agreement\"), in the political field, the mutual mistrust between EAM and the other groups escalated. EAM-ELAS was by now the dominant political and military force in Greece, and EDES and EKKA, along with the British and the Greek government-in-exile, feared that after the inevitable German withdrawal, it would try to dominate the country and establish a soviet regime. This prospect was not only linked with the increasing distrust shown by many conservative and traditional liberal members of the Greek society towards the Communists and EAM, but also with British. The British were opposed to an EAM's after-war dominance in Greece due to their political opposition to communism, while on the logic of the spheres of influence they believed that such a development would lead the country, which traditionally considered belongs in their sphere of influence, to that of the Soviet Union. Finally the conflict of interests between them and the USSR settled after British secured Soviet assent to this in the so-called \"percentages agreement\" between Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin in October 1944. EAM on its part considered itself \"the only true resistance group\". Its leadership was intensely distrustful of British policies for Greece, and viewed Zervas' contacts with London and the Greek government with suspicion.\n\nAt the same time, EAM found itself under attack by the Germans and their collaborators. Dominated by the old political class, and looking already to the oncoming post-Liberation era, the new Ioannis Rallis government had established the notorious Security Battalions, with the blessing of the German authorities, in order to fight exclusively against ELAS. Other anti-communist resistance groups, such as the royalist Organization \"X\", were also reinforced, receiving arms and funding by the British.\n\nA virtual civil war was now being waged under the eyes of the Germans. In October 1943, ELAS attacked EDES in Epirus, where the latter organization was the dominant resistance group, by transferring units from the neighbouring regions. This conflict continued until February 1944, when the British mission in Greece succeeded in negotiating a ceasefire (the Plaka agreement) which in the event proved to be only temporary. The attack led to an unofficial truce between EDES and the German forces in Epirus under General Hubert Lanz. But the fight continued amongst ELAS and the other minor resistance groups (like \"X\"), as well as against the Security Battalions, even in the streets of Athens, until the German withdrawal in October 1944. In March, EAM established its own rival government in Free Greece, the Political Committee of National Liberation, clearly staking its claim to a dominant role in post-war Greece. Consequently, on Easter Monday, 17 April 1944, ELAS forces attacked and destroyed the EKKA's 5/42 Regiment, capturing and executing many of its men, including its leader Colonel Dimitrios Psarros. The event caused a major shock in the Greek political scene, since Psarros was a well-known republican, patriot and anti-royalist. For EAM-ELAS, this act was fatal, as it strengthened suspicion of its intentions for the post-Occupation period, and drove many liberals and moderates, especially in the cities, against it, cementing the emerging rift in Greek society between pro- and anti-EAM segments.\n\nThe resistance in Crete was centred in the mountainous interior, and despite the strong presence of German troops, developed significant activity. Notable figures of the Cretan Resistance include Patrick Leigh Fermor, Xan Fielding, Dudley Perkins, Thomas Dunbabin, Petrakogiorgis, Kimonas Zografakis, Manolis Paterakis and George Psychoundakis. Resistance operations included airfield sabotages, the abduction of General Heinrich Kreipe by Patrick Leigh Fermor and Bill Stanley Moss, the battle of Trahili, and the sabotage of Damasta. In reprisal, many villages were razed and their inhabitants murdered during anti-partisan operations. Examples include Alikianos, Kali Sykia, Kallikratis, Kondomari, Malathyros; the razings of Kandanos, Anogeia and Vorizia; the holocausts of Viannos and Kedros and numerous incidents of smaller scale.\n\nOn Euboea, Sara Fortis led a small, all-female company of partisans against the German occupational forces.\n\nResistance in the cities was organized quickly, but of necessity groups were small and fragmented. The cities, and the working-class suburbs of Athens in particular, witnessed appalling suffering in the winter of 1941-42, when food confiscations and disrupted communications caused widespread famine and perhaps hundreds of thousands of deaths. This caused fertile ground for recruitment, but lack of equipment, funds and organization limited the spread of the resistance. The main roles of resistance operatives were intelligence and sabotage, mostly in cooperation with British Intelligence. One of the earliest jobs of the urban resistance was helping stranded Commonwealth soldiers escape. The resistance groups stayed in touch with British handlers through wireless sets, met and helped British spies and saboteurs that parachuted in, provided intelligence, conducted propaganda efforts, and ran escape networks for allied operatives and Greek young men wishing to join the Hellenic forces in exile. Wireless equipment, money, weapons and other support was mainly supplied by British Intelligence, but it was never enough. Fragmentation of groups, the need for secrecy, and emerging conflicts between right and left, monarchists and republicans, did not help. Urban resistance work was very dangerous: operatives were always in danger of arrest and summary execution, and suffered heavy casualties. Captured fighters were routinely tortured by the Abwehr and the Gestapo, and confessions used to roll up networks. The job of wireless operators was perhaps the most dangerous, since the Germans used direction-finding equipment to pinpoint the location of transmitters; operators were often shot on the spot, and those were the lucky ones, since immediate execution prevented torture.\n\nOne of the most important forms of resistance were the mass protest movements. The first such event occurred during the national anniversary of 25 March 1942, when students attempted to lay a wreath at the Monument of the Unknown Soldier. This resulted in clashes with mounted \"Carabinieri\", and marked the awakening of the spirit of Resistance amongst the wider urban population. Soon after, from 12–14 April, the \"TTT\" (Telecommunications & Postal) workers began a strike in Athens, which spread throughout the country. Initially, the strikers' demands were financial, but it quickly assumed a political aspect, as the strike was encouraged by EAM's labour union organization, EEAM. Finally, the strike ended on April 21, with the full capitulation of the collaborationist government to the strikers' demands, including the immediate release of arrested strike leaders.\n\nIn early 1943, rumours spread of a planned mobilization of the labour force by the occupation authorities, with the intent of sending them to work in Germany. The first reactions began amongst students on 7 February, but soon grew in scope and volume. Throughout February, successive strikes and demonstrations paralyzed Athens, culminating in a massive rally on the 24th. The tense climate was amply displayed at the funeral of Greece's national poet, Kostis Palamas, on 28 February, which turned into an anti-Axis demonstration.\n\nResisting the Axis occupation was fraught with risks. Foremost among these for the partisans was death in combat as the German military forces were far superior. However, the guerrilla fighters also had to face starvation, brutal environmental conditions in the mountains of Greece, while poorly clothed and shod.\n\nThe resistance also involved risks for ordinary Greeks. Attacks often incited reprisal killings of civilians by the German occupying forces. Villages were burned and their inhabitants massacred. The Germans also resorted to hostage taking. There were also accusations that many of ELAS' attacks against German soldiers didn't happen for resistance reasons but aiming the destruction of specific villages and the recruitment of their men. Quotas were even introduced determining the number of civilians or hostages to be killed in response to the death or wounding of German soldiers.\n\n\n\n"}

He was an army surgeon.\n\nIshihara graduated from medicine in 1905 on a military scholarship and immediately joined the Imperial Japanese Army as a doctor, serving mainly as a surgeon. He later changed specialties to ophthalmology. In 1908 he returned to the University of Tokyo where he dedicated himself to ophthalmic research. In 1910 he became an instructor at the Army Medical College. There, in addition to seeing patients, he conducted research on \"battlefield ophthalmology\" and how to select superior soldiers. While working at the Military Medical School he was asked to devise a test to screen military recruits for abnormalities of color vision. His assistant was a color blind physician who helped him test the plates. The first charts were hand painted by Ishihara in water colors using hiragana symbols.\n\nThe name Ishihara is known worldwide because of the Ishihara Color Vision charts which he established in 1918. Ishihara developed a Japanese visual acuity chart and an apparatus for determining the near point, both currently in wide use in Japan. He also made significant contributions to the study of trachoma and myopia.\nIn 1908, Ishihara entered the postgraduate course in ophthalmology at the Imperial University of Tokyo, studying under Jujiro Komoto. Subsequently, he studied in Germany under Professors Wolfgang Stock, Theodor Axenfeld and Carl von Hess. Ishihara was appointed the professor and chairman, to succeed Komoto, at the Ophthalmology Department of the Imperial University of Tokyo in 1922 and served until March 1940.\n\nIshihara led a very modest life, with no interest in material possessions. He was greatly revered by his students who, after his retirement, built a cottage for him near a hot spring on the Izu Peninsula. There he served as a country doctor, conducting clinics for his neighbors, asking no payment. As was the custom in those days, patients left tokens of their gratitude in home-grown produce and small sums of money. After covering his expenses, Ishihara returned all remaining money to the villagers. These funds were used to build a library and a study room for the village children, a fitting tribute to the highly respected benefactor who came to live in their midst until his death in 1963.\n"}

Her 2002 film \"Whale Rider\" was critically praised and won a number of awards at international film festivals. She was hired to direct the 2020 live-action version of Disney's \"Mulan\", making her the second female and the second New Zealand director hired by Disney to direct a film budgeted at over $100 million.\n\nCaro was born in Wellington, New Zealand. She attended Kadimah College, Auckland, then Diocesan School for Girls, where she received an alumni award. Caro graduated with a BFA from the Elam School of Fine Arts at the University of Auckland in 1988 and received a Postgraduate Diploma in Film from the Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.\n\nCaro first found interest in working with metal sculptures, but later changed in it to film. She did not receive any formal training in the field, but instead began by reading narrative film books and writing rough drafts for scripts. Caro's mother would type her handwritten drafts after she finished writing each one.\n\nCaro's first experience in directing was when she was hired to create commercials for different companies such as the New Zealand Land Transport Safety Authority, Nike and Tower Insurance, but it was only after being signed by a production company to write and direct for the television series, \"Another Country\" that she had her first breakthrough. She did not have any experience in directing, but it felt it was instinctual once she started working with the actors.\n\nCaro's first feature film, \"Memory & Desire\", was meant to be a showcase of New Zealand's culture and lifestyle (aligning with the start of the 100% Pure New Zealand tourism campaign by the New Zealand tourism section of the government), but it fell short; seeing disappointing results at the box office and mixed international reviews. This was especially true in Japan, where the film was deemed to have not captured the essence of Japanese culture, despite its attempts to evoke money and consult from possible Japanese investors. The film is meant to use landscapes to juxtapose the characters and their origins. The calm and relaxed outdoor setting of New Zealand is meant to oppose the hustle and bustle of the big, busy city of Tokyo. It works twofold because the contrast also works for the comparison of the \"civilized\" parts of New Zealand against the wild outdoors, showing off the two different sections of the country in an effort to advertise to multiple groups of people considering visiting the country. The tourism board looked to use landscapes as the most enticing factor in a tourist's eyes, along with people, adventure and culture. The film shows evidence of this by implying that Keiji and Sayo are unable to consummate their marriage anywhere but in the outdoors due to Keiji being unable to achieve an erection in an urban setting, emphasizing the \"natural\" state of humanism of being connected to the surrounding landscapes. Along the couple's trip they encounter different New Zealand tourist hotspots such as; the Museum of Technology and Rotorua's spa pools on the West Coast Beach. It is also in contrast of the bland hotel rooms that the couple stay in; as if to say that the only time they are truly free is when they are outside in nature, specifically New Zealand's nature.\n\nIt was chosen for Critics' Week at Cannes week in 1998. In 1999 the film was voted best new film at the New Zealand Film Awards.\n\nCaro went on to write and direct \"Whale Rider\", which is about a Māori girl that has to stand up against the other men and her grandfather in the tribe to show she can be as much of a leader as the boys who were being trained to be leaders. Caro argues that \"Whale Rider\" is more about leadership than sexism because the Māori are also profoundly matriarchal. Caro says there is a Māori saying that \"women lead from behind,\" even though in their culture, knowledge and lineage are passed down through the males and not the women. She directed thirteen-year-old Keisha Castle-Hughes to a performance nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress. The film had a budget of 2 million, which is considered small for a major film, but it was still considered to be a good interpretation of the indigenous story that it was trying to interpret and demonstrate. \"Whale Rider\" would also go on to become New Zealand's most financially successful film and either the film, or Caro herself, would win or be nominated for over 50 different awards by different, international film festivals.\n\nWith the success of \"Whale Rider\" under her belt, Caro was chosen to direct her first Hollywood film, \"North Country\" (2005), starring Charlize Theron. It was later nominated for Best Actress for lead and supporting role at the Oscars, and also was nominated for a \"Golden Globe\".\n\nAfter doing \"North Country\", Caro went back to New Zealand to write and direct the feature film \"The Vintner's Luck\" (2009) otherwise known as \"A Heavenly Vintage\", which is about a peasant winemaker who sets out to make the perfect vintage wine. The film reunited her with her \"Whale Rider\" star Keisha Castle-Hughes.\n\nIn 2013, Caro planned to direct the film adaptation of \"The Zookeeper's Wife\", based on Diane Ackerman's non-fiction book. It was released in 2017 and received generally mixed to positive reviews. In an interview with FF2 Media, Caro states that \"female sexuality from a female's point of view is rather under-explored in cinema\" and so felt it necessary to include such a perspective in her film. \n\nCaro directed \"McFarland, USA\" starring Kevin Costner. It was released in February 2015 and has received a critical success.\n\nCaro will also be writing and directing the biographical film \"Callas\", about the famous opera singer Maria Callas and her relationship with billionaire Aristotle Onassis.\n\nIn February 2017, Caro was hired to direct Disney's live-action adaptation of \"Mulan\" and then Untitled film based on \"The Wuzzles\". She is the second woman at the studio to direct a film budgeted at over $100 million, after Ava DuVernay (2018's \"A Wrinkle in Time\"), and the second New Zealander, after Taika Waititi (2017's \"\").\n\nIn 18 November 2019, Caro will direct Amazon TV series \"Daisy Jones and the Six\" which is based on novel by Taylor Jenkins Reid and produced by Reese Witherspoon.\n\nCaro is married to architect Andrew Lister, and they have two daughters, Tui and Pearl. Their first daughter was born shortly after the success of \"Whale Rider\". Because Caro was pregnant, she was unable to attend any of the premieres for the film. Caro said she was sad, but at the same time thought it may not be such a bad thing because success in America is so radical.\n\n\n\n"}

He later sold the premises in 1938 because the building of Shing Mun Reservoir in 1935 and the Japanese invasion of China in 1937 seriously affected his business.\n\nBetween 1938 and 1941, he used his boat to take his nudist club members to the bay to continue their gathering. The number of members reached its height at around 20.\n\nDuring the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong (1941–1945), he lost his boat and the club's activities were interrupted. He rented boats instead to take the members to the bay and reformed his club as a sunbathing club 1950s.\n\nOn 1 January 1968 all nudist activities halted owing to insufficient participants.\n\nThe bay remained largely silent in the 1970s and 1980s, and only occasionally explorers came to find its past.\n\nThe bay became more accessible when Hong Kong United Dockyards (HUD) was built closer to the bay in 1976. Tsing Yi Road was extended to the dockyard.\n\nThe early 1990s saw construction of the Tsing Ma Bridge, an integral part of the Port and Airport Development Strategy The suspension bridge spans from the hill at the back of Wok Tai Wan. Wok Tai Wan was reclaimed for building one of the two towers of the bridge and for a pier supporting the road from the tower to the hill.\n"}

A left-handed opening batsman, he made his One Day International (ODI) debut for Bangladesh in 2005 against England, and later the same year played his first Test.\n\nIn 2008 he joined the Indian Cricket League (ICL) as part of the Dhaka Warriors. The members of the team were given 10-year bans by the Bangladesh Cricket Board which were lifted when they left the league. Nafees has since returned to the national team. Domestically he plays for Barisal Division.\n\nNafees first played in the national team in Bangladesh's maiden tour of England (2005). Nafees scored his maiden first-class century, as well as his first in Tests, at Fatullah in April 2006 against Australia. He scored his maiden one-day hundred against Zimbabwe in August 2006. Nafees was the first Bangladeshi batsman to score a century in Champions Trophy history and he held the record for the highest individual score for Bangladesh in Champions Trophy until Tamim Iqbal surpassed his milestone\n\nNafees was appointed vice-captain for the Champions Trophy in India in October 2006 with the view of grooming a successor for Habibul Bashar. The tournament was a successful one for him as he scored his second ODI century, again Zimbabwe were his opponents. He scored his third century against Zimbabwe again in November. Nafees finished 2006 with over 1,000 ODI runs, becoming the first Bangladeshi to pass the milestone in a calendar year.\n\nOnce again available to play for Bangladesh, Nafees returned to the squad for the first time since joining the ICL in preparation for Bangladesh's home series against India in January. Bangladesh lost both Tests, and Nafees played in one, scoring 25 runs. His Test come-back lasted one match and Nafees would have to wait more than 18 months before playing another Test. He made his return in an ODI series against New Zealand in October 2010 in which he scored 35 as Bangladesh won that match and 73 in the next match as Bangladesh once again took a seven-wicket victory. Despite his good performance Nafees was originally selected on the grounds that Tamim Iqbal was injured and eventually made way for him in the series against Zimbabwe and he was placed on standby in case of an injury. In the first two years after his return from the ICL Nafees played just four ODIs.\n\nIncluded in Bangladesh's squad for the 2011 World Cup, Nafees played in two matches (scoring 42 runs) as the team exited the tournament in the group stage. He was retained in the squad to face Australia in three ODIs immediately after the World Cup finished in April, and struck two half-centuries that cemented his place in the side. Nafees was recalled to the squad to face Zimbabwe in August. In the one-off Test, his first since January 2010, he made scores of 50 and 9 as Bangladesh unexpectedly slid to defeat.\n\nAfter scoring 82 runs including a half-century in the first Test against the West Indies in October, Nafees endured a run of low scores across Tests and ODIs that jeopardised his place in the team. He responded by striking an innings of 97 against Pakistan in the second match of a two-Test series. The 180-run partnership was a landmark in several ways: it was record for Bangladesh's fifth wicket, the first time the team had batted through a whole session without losing a wicket since March 2010, and the team's first century partnership in Tests since June 2010.\n\nHe was the first T20I captain for Bangladesh and also he's the youngest T20I captain for Bangladesh at the age of 21 years and 211 days and he's 2nd only youngest to lead his team in T20I after Rodney Trott\n\nIn June 2008 Nafees joined the unauthorised Indian Cricket League and was given a ten-year ban by the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) however he severed his ties with the league in September 2009 and was therefore available for national selection.\n\nThe Bangladesh Cricket Board founded the six-team Bangladesh Premier League in 2012, a twenty20 tournament to be held in February that year. The BCB made Shahriar the 'icon player' for Barisal Burners. Despite his status, Nafees played just five matches, scoring 38 runs.\n\nIn the 2nd edition of BPL held in 2013, he joined Khulna Royal Bengals. He was selected as the captain of the team. He scored the maiden century in BPL 2. Before him, no other Bangladeshi player scored a century in the history of BPL.\n\nHe was the leading run-scorer for Agrani Bank Cricket Club in the 2017–18 Dhaka Premier Division Cricket League, with 550 runs in 13 matches.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2147979", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2147979", "title": "Oregon Route 18", "text": "Oregon Route 18\n\nOregon Route 18 is a state highway that runs between the Oregon Coast, near Lincoln City and Newberg. OR 18 traverses the Salmon River Highway No. 39 of the Oregon state highway system, named after the river alongside its westernmost segments.\n\nOR 18 begins (at its western terminus) at a junction with U.S. Route 101, a few miles north of Lincoln City near Otis Junction. From there it winds eastward though the coast range along the Salmon River, past Rose Lodge and through a stand of timber known as the Van Duzer Corridor. Emerging from the coast range, it enters the fringes of the Willamette Valley in the community of Grand Ronde. It is briefly joined by Oregon Route 22 at a location known as Valley Junction, and overlaps OR 22 in a four-mile (6 km) stretch between Grand Ronde and Willamina, at which point OR 22 heads southeast towards Salem and OR 18 continues northeast towards the Portland area. Also in Willamina, a business route veers off to the north to serve the cities of Willamina and Sheridan; east of Sheridan the business route rejoins the mainline. This business loop was the former route and highway until 1957, when the current Oregon Route 18 was built as a bypass.\n\nThe highway continues northeast on a straight and level course through Willamette Valley farmland, including the community of Bellevue which intersects with Oregon Route 153, until it intersects with Oregon Route 99W just south of McMinnville. In the McMinnville area, OR 99W serves as the primary business route (entering the downtown core) whereas OR 18 is a bypass route. Two interchanges along OR 18 provide access to McMinnville, including Three-Mile Lane, a spur of the highway. Oregon Route 18 provides direct access to the McMinnville Airport and the Evergreen Aviation Museum, home of the Spruce Goose. East of McMinnville, Oregon Route 18 intersects Oregon Route 233, with which it overlaps until its eastern terminus, and Oregon Route 221; the latter near the city of Dayton. It then crosses over the Yamhill River to a second junction with OR 99W. OR 18 then follows OR 99W to Dundee, and follows the Newberg-Dundee bypass and terminates at a junction with OR 219. Typically, commuters continue north on OR 99W into the Portland area.\n\nThe highway is rather variant in its configuration. For most of its length, the highway is a two-lane undivided highway, with intersections and cross traffic. There are some limited-access stretches in the \"bypass\" sections (around the Willamina/Sheridan area, and near McMinnville and Dayton), and the occasional interchange in these stretches. In addition, there is a stretch between Willamina and Sheridan where the highway becomes a 4-lane divided expressway.\n\nFor several years, Route 18 has had a rather notorious reputation among motorists in Oregon, with a relatively high number of fatal accidents. The opening of two casinos, one in Grand Ronde and one in Lincoln City, have greatly increased traffic on OR 18. (In addition, the stretch of Oregon Route 99W immediately north of Dayton, through Dundee and Newberg, is a notorious traffic bottleneck.) Portions of Oregon Route 18 have been designated a safety corridor.\n\nThere are two proposed expansions to the highway. One is a project which would widen Oregon Route 18 to a four-lane expressway in the stretch between Grand Ronde and Willamina; an area where increased volume (largely due to the casino) has caused significant delays. This project is now completed with an overpass that closed down and blocked off a very fatal intersection.\n\nThe second project, also now completed, is a new bypass around the Newberg-Dundee area intended to alleviate severe congestion that occurred along 99W. The Newberg-Dundee bypass is an expressway, numbered Oregon Route 18. Construction on the first phase began in June 2013, and the section opened at 5am on January 6, 2018. This section connects Oregon 219 south of Newberg to 99W west of Dundee. The entire bypass was expected to cost $262 million. It has four lanes and reconnects to 99W east of Newberg.\n\nOregon Route 18 Business is a business route state highway in the U.S. state of Oregon that runs parallel to Oregon Route 18 between the Willamina, and Sheridan, in the Yamhill Valley. OR 18B traverses the Willamina–Sheridan Highway No. 157 of the Oregon state highway system. It is also known as the West Valley Highway.\n\nOregon 18B begins (at its western terminus) at a junction with Oregon Route 18 and Oregon Route 22, at Valley Junction near Willimina. From there it travels eastward just north of the South Yamhill River. The river occasionally floods and closes the road. It passes through the community of Shipley, before entering Sheridan. OR 18B then reconnects to OR 18 at the eastern edge of Sheridan.\n\nThe business loop was the former main route and highway until 1957, when the current Oregon Route 18 was built as a bypass. Route 18 Business is long. The only traffic light on the road is in Sheridan at the intersection of 18B and Bridge Street where Sheridan Bridge crosses the South Yamhill River. In Sheridan the highway is Main Street. It is classified as a Rural Major Connector highway.\n\nBusiness 18 averages approximately 5,900 vehicles per day at its eastern terminus and 6,000 near the western terminus in Willimina. Traffic averages around 5,400 vehicles per day between those two points.\n\n"}

His first name is often misspelled \"Raymond\" or \"Raimond\" though he personally prefers to spell his name as Raymund. The breadth of his projects has made him one of the most well-respected mainstays of the Philippine rock band scene. He was the drummer, vocalist and lyricist alongside bandmate Ely Buendia of The Eraserheads, and the current keyboard/synths player for Pedicab, former rhythm guitarist and now frontman of Sandwich, current drummer of Cambio, vocalist of Project 1 and the man behind Squid 9. Currently, he holds bass for his newest band, Gaijin. Aside from writing songs and being a musician, he is also a record producer, voice actor, TV host and product endorser.\n\nHe first achieved fame as drummer for the rock band Eraserheads, one of the most popular Philippine bands of the 1990s. He played the drums, provided backing vocals, and occasionally sang on lead vocals. Marasigan's songwriting output for the Eraserheads was only next to that of its principal songwriter Ely Buendia.\n\nIn 2002, vocalist-guitarist Ely Buendia left the Eraserheads, and Kris Dancel from the all-female band Fatal Posporos was recruited to fill the vacancy. The group billed themselves as Eheads and issued an EP entitled \"Please Transpose\" (2003). The group later renamed themselves Cambio after their lead guitarist Marcus Adoro quit. Cambio released two albums: \"Derby Light\" (2003) and \"Matic\" (2007).\n\nOn August 30, 2008 at the Fort Bonifacio Open Grounds in Taguig, Marasigan joined Buendia, Adoro, and Zabala for The Eraserheads reunion concert. The continuation of the reunion \"The Final Set\" was held on March 7, 2009 at the SM Mall of Asia concert grounds.\n\nThe band Sandwich was formed in 1995 with Myrene Academia (Imago) & (Duster) on bass, Marc Abaya on lead guitars and vocals later replaced by Mong Alcaraz of Chicosci on guitars when the former quit to focus on being an MTV mainstay, Diego Castillo on rhythm guitars, and Mike Dizon (of bands Pedicab and Teeth) on drums. Although existing simultaneously with the Eraserheads, Sandwich provided a heavier, grittier sound, and built up their own fan base. Marc Abaya left the band in 2005 to concentrate on his career as a VJ while frontlining for his other band Kjwan and Marasigan took over as the lead vocalist. They have released three albums: \"Grip Stand Throw\" and \"4-Track Mind\" (later reissued as a 2-in-1 by Sony BMG, and 2004's award-winning \"Thanks to the Moon's Gravitational Pull\" (initially an indie release; then later reissued by EMI Philippines with bonus tracks. Sandwich released further albums, entitled \"Five on the Floor\" (2006) which featured the phenomenal hit single, \"Sugod\", and \"<S> Marks the Spot\" (2008), with its hit single \"Procrastinator\" and \"Betamax\".\n\nIn early 2005, Marasigan once again formed Pedicab, another project band. Composed of seasoned artists donning alter egos; Raymund (a.k.a. Sugarraims) is on synths and backup vocals; Mike Dizon (of Sandwich and Teeth) a.k.a. Masterbeat is on drums; Jason Caballa (of Twisted Halo and Blast Ople) a.k.a. J. Sonic is on guitar and backup vocals; Diego Mapa (of Monsterbot and Cambio) a.k.a. Daddy Maps is lead vocals; and acclaimed music video director RA Rivera a.k.a. Just Toni is on visuals and multimedia. They call their music \"dunk music\" which is essentially their own version of Dance-punk. They released a two-track sampler called \"For Hire\" with tracks \"Bago Pa Mag Pasko\" and \"Pa-Experience\". Pedicab's first album \"Tugish Takish\" (the name coming from onomatopoeia of the sounds made by banging on drums) under Vicor music was released later that year. Tugish Takish has spawned hits such as \"Dito Tayo Sa Dilim\", \"Dizzy Boy\", \"Konti Na Lang\" and \"A Stormy Night\". Their second album \"Shinji Ilabas Mo Na Ang Helicopter\" with carrier single \"Ang Pusa Mo\" was released in April 2008 under MCA Records Philippines. Their second album also contains the remake of \"Pa-Experience\" which they retitled to \"Pa-Taste\". It also has fan favorites such as \"FX\", \"Follow Through\", and \"Breaking Away\".\n\nIn 2008, Marasigan launched his new album with Sandwich, after that, he also launched a one-shot band called \"Project 1\" with Clem Castro (former Orange and Lemons, now The Camerawalls) on guitars, Francis Reyes (The Dawn) also on guitars, Carlos Calderon (Chicosci) on bass, Jazz Nicolas (Itchyworms) on drums and Uela Basco (Chilitees), Katwo Librando (Narda/Duster) and Marasigan himself on vocals. Their first single \"Ang Sarap Dito\" was released in March 2008. According to its members, \"\"The new group was formed because we, as artists, feel that we wanted to create something fresh, especially for the young generation. We all believe in a common goal of being positive and changing the way young people think.\"\" Their first and only single was used by Coca-Cola Philippines for television and radio commercials and also by .\n\nSquid 9 is a hip-hop influenced band that started out as a studio act and is formed from members of the Eraserheads, Monsterbot and Sun Valley Crew among others. It was soon performing live shows as well. Squid 9 released three albums: \"Deleted Scenes\", \"Kraken Modular\" and \"Ink Jet\". Squid 9 is also part of Electronica Manila and often collaborated with the late Wolfmann+. Squid9 Live is composed of Marasigan on samplers, drum machine and Chaos Pad), Vin Dancel (Twisted Halo and Peryodiko) and Kathy Meneses (Daydreamcycle) on vocals, Buddy Zabala (The Eraserheads, The Dawn, Twisted Halo & Cambio) on bass, keyboards and samplers and Rann Golamco (Drip, Porta, and formerly of Mojofly) on guitars. Marasigan calls his home studio \"The Squid Crib\".\n\nMarasigan started Planet Garapata also in 1996, a short-lived hip-hop and electronica project that featured Eraserheads bassist Buddy Zabala, Rivermaya drummer Mark Escueta and Eraserheads sound engineer Mark Laccay and Jeng Tan. The project debuted in Francis M.'s 1996 Happy Battle album and featured Marasigan's early rapping skills.\n\nHe is also part of Sun Valley Crew, a hip-hop/rap group with members Ryan Armamento and RJ Seneres on vocals, Uela Basco also on vocals, Mong Alcaraz on guitars, Dan Gil on Rhodes keyboards, Dex Aguila on Drums, Raimund Marasigan on samplers and Ryan Ventura on bass.\n\nHe is often dubbed as \"The Philippines' busiest musician\", with multiple but different, simultaneous bands, in addition to collaborations with various artists such as Francis Magalona, The Pin-Up Girls, Rivermaya, Keltscross, Sugarfree, Itchyworms, Chicosci, Freestyle, Wolfmann, The Dawn, Chillitees, and others.\n\nMarasigan collaborated with Radioactive Sago Project's Lourd de Verya and they created the song \"Egis, Er'p!\" for a film about Philippine Science High School System, titled \"Pisay\". Marasigan also sang the theme song for UPCAT movie.\n\nMarasigan (on keyboards and guitars) had a project band with Mark Laccay (bass), Dexter Aguila (drums, now with Chillitees), Thaddeus \"Duff\" Reantaso (vocals) and Mike Elgar (guitars, before he joined Rivermaya), called Blueberry Juice which lasted until 1994.\n\nMarasigan is the bassist and percussionist of the new band called Gaijin, fronted by Jesse Grinter (guitars and vocals) and Shinji Tanaka (drums). Gaijin means \"foreigner\" in Japanese. As the name implies, the group is composed of different artists from different heritages. Marasigan is Filipino, Grinter is American, and Tanaka is Japanese. Given the multi-national status of the band, their music is also focused towards the international music scene.\n\nHe was chosen by ABS-CBN, together with Rico Blanco and Aia de Leon, for the theme song of the network's 2010 elections campaign, which calls on Filipinos, especially the youth, to register, vote, and make the 2010 elections work. It also features the \"Boto Mo, iPatrol Mo\" drumbeat.\n\nIn 2014 he collaborate with rap prince Abra for \"Sanib Puwersa\" (\"Joined Forces\") for beer brand Colt 45, the main competitor of Red Horse Beer which was endorsed by former bandmante Ely Buendia and Joey Pepe Smith.\n\nMarasigan also launched Assembly Generals in 2015, which is dubbed as \"Raw Electric Filipino Hiphop\", with members Paolo Toledo, Mon Punzalan, and Deng Garcia. Beng Calma of Drip also collaborated on the band's album.\n\nMarasigan's latest collaboration is an alternative new band called \"Basement Lung\". Its members are Don Marasigan (Vocals), Choy Guerra (guitar,vocals), Menel Emralino (bass), Tyob Sevilla (guitar) and Marasigan (drums).\n\nHe is also the voice behind the character of Taira Yoshiyuki in the Philippine-edition of Beck: Mongolian Chop Squad aired in Hero TV.\n\nAfter some various TV appearances as a host, such as being a guest host and part of Studio 23's Breakfast, Marasigan was picked by Myx to be the first and current host of Myx Tugtugan. He is also the \"Songwriting Teacher\" for ABS-CBN's Pinoy Dream Academy.\n\nMarasigan was with Jeng Tan (bassist of The Pin-up Girls) for a very long time, but then lived-in with Sandwich, Imago & Duster bassist Myrene Academia from 2000–2008. The two have a daughter named Atari Kim. He is currently in a relationship with Erica dela Cruz and remained friends with Academia.\n"}

{"id": "2148015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2148015", "title": "Spatial ecology", "text": "Spatial ecology\n\nSpatial ecology studies the ultimate distributional or spatial unit occupied by a species. In a particular habitat shared by several species, each of the species is usually confined to its own microhabitat or spatial niche because two species in the same general territory cannot usually occupy the same ecological niche for any significant length of time.\n\nIn nature, organisms are neither distributed uniformly nor at random, forming instead some sort of spatial pattern. This is due to various energy inputs, disturbances, and species interactions that result in spatially patchy structures or gradients. This spatial variance in the environment creates diversity in communities of organisms, as well as in the variety of the observed biological and ecological events. The type of spatial arrangement present may suggest certain interactions within and between species, such as competition, predation, and reproduction. On the other hand, certain spatial patterns may also rule out specific ecological theories previously thought to be true.\n\nAlthough spatial ecology deals with spatial patterns, it is usually based on observational data rather than on an existing model. This is because nature rarely follows set expected order. To properly research a spatial pattern or population, the spatial extent to which it occurs must be detected. Ideally, this would be accomplished beforehand via a benchmark spatial survey, which would determine whether the pattern or process is on a local, regional, or global scale. This is rare in actual field research, however, due to the lack of time and funding, as well as the ever-changing nature of such widely-studied organisms such as insects and wildlife. With detailed information about a species' life-stages, dynamics, demography, movement, behavior, etc., models of spatial pattern may be developed to estimate and predict events in unsampled locations.\n\nMost mathematical studies in ecology in the nineteenth century assumed a uniform distribution of living organisms in their habitat. In the past quarter century, ecologists have begun to recognize the degree to which organisms respond to spatial patterns in their environment. Due to the rapid advances in computer technology in the same time period, more advanced methods of statistical data analysis have come into use. Also, the repeated use of remotely sensed imagery and geographic information systems in a particular area has led to increased analysis and identification of spatial patterns over time. These technologies have also increased the ability to determine how human activities have impacted animal habitat and climate change. The natural world has become increasingly fragmented due to human activities; anthropogenic landscape change has had a ripple-effect impacts on wildlife populations, which are now more likely to be small, restricted in distribution, and increasingly isolated from one another. In part as a reaction to this knowledge, and partially due to increasingly sophisticated theoretical developments, ecologists began stressing the importance of spatial context in research. Spatial ecology emerged from this movement toward spatial accountability; \"the progressive introduction of spatial variation and complexity into ecological analysis, including changes in spatial patterns over time\".\n\nIn spatial ecology, scale refers to the spatial extent of ecological processes and the spatial interpretation of the data. The response of an organism or a species to the environment is particular to a specific scale, and may respond differently at a larger or smaller scale. Choosing a scale that is appropriate to the ecological process in question is very important in accurately hypothesizing and determining the underlying cause. Most often, ecological patterns are a result of multiple ecological processes, which often operate at more than one spatial scale. Through the use of such spatial statistical methods such as geostatistics and principal coordinate analysis of neighbor matrices (PCNM), one can identify spatial relationships between organisms and environmental variables at multiple scales.\n\nSpatial autocorrelation refers to the value of samples taken close to each other are more likely to have similar magnitude than by chance alone. When a pair of values located at a certain distance apart are more similar than expected by chance, the spatial autocorrelation is said to be positive. When a pair of values are less similar, the spatial autocorrelation is said to be negative. It is common for values to be positively autocorrelated at shorter distances and negative autocorrelated at longer distances. This is commonly known as Tobler's first law of geography, summarized as \"everything is related to everything else, but nearby objects are more related than distant objects\".\n\nIn ecology, there are two important sources of spatial autocorrelation, which both arise from spatial-temporal processes, such as dispersal or migration:\n\nMost ecological data exhibit some degree of spatial autocorrelation, depending on the ecological scale (spatial resolution) of interest. As the spatial arrangement of most ecological data is not random, traditional random population samples tend to overestimate the true value of a variable, or infer significant correlation where there is none. This bias can be corrected through the use of geostatistics and other more statistically advanced models. Regardless of method, the sample size must be appropriate to the scale and the spatial statistical method used in order to be valid.\n\nSpatial patterns, such as the distribution of a species, are the result of either true or induced spatial autocorrelation. In nature, organisms are distributed neither uniformly nor at random. The environment is spatially structured by various ecological processes, which in combination with the behavioral response of species’ generally results in:\n\nTheoretically, any of these structures may occur at any given scale. Due to the presence of spatial autocorrelation, in nature gradients are generally found at the global level, whereas patches represent intermediate (regional) scales, and noise at local scales.\n\nThe analysis of spatial ecological patterns comprises two families of methods;\n\nAnalysis of spatial trends has been used to research wildlife management, fire ecology, population ecology, disease ecology, invasive species, marine ecology, and carbon sequestration modeling using the spatial relationships and patterns to determine ecological processes and their effects on the environment.\nSpatial patterns have different ecosystem functioning in ecology for examples enhanced productive.\n\nThe concepts of spatial ecology are fundamental to understanding the spatial dynamics of population and community ecology. The spatial heterogeneity of populations and communities plays a central role in such ecological theories as succession, adaptation, community stability, competition, predator-prey interactions, parasitism, and epidemics. The rapidly expanding field of landscape ecology utilizes the basic aspects of spatial ecology in its research.\n\nThe practical use of spatial ecology concepts is essential to understanding the consequences of fragmentation and habitat loss for wildlife. Understanding the response of a species to a spatial structure provides useful information in regards to biodiversity conservation and habitat restoration.\n\nSpatial ecology modeling uses components of remote sensing and geographical information systems (GIS).\n\nA number of statistical tests have been developed to study such relations.\n\nClark and Evans in 1954 proposed a test based on the density and distance between organisms. Under the null hypothesis the expected distance ( \"r\" ) between the organisms (measured as the nearest neighbor's distance) with a known constant density ( \"ρ\" ) is\n\nThe difference between the observed ( \"r\" ) and the expected ( \"r\" ) can be tested with a Z test\n\nwhere \"A\" is the area of the region sampled and \"N\" is the total number of organisms. For large samples \"Z\" is distributed normally. The results are usually reported in the form of a ratio: \"R\" = ( \"r\" ) / ( \"r\" )\n\nPielou in 1959 devised a different statistic. She considered instead of the nearest neighbors the distance between an organism and a set of pre-chosen random points within the sampling area, again assuming a constant density. If the population is randomly dispersed in the area these distances will equal the nearest neighbor distances. Let \"ω\" be the ratio between the distances from the random points and the distances calculated from the nearest neighbor calculations. The \"α\" is\n\nwhere \"d\" is the constant common density and π has its usual numerical value. Values of α less than, equal to or greater than 1 indicate uniformity, randomness (a Poisson distribution) or aggregation respectively. Alpha may be tested for a significant deviation from 1 by computing the test statistic\n\nwhere \"χ\" is distributed with 2\"n\" degrees of freedom. \"n\" here is the number of organisms sampled.\n\nMontford in 1961 showed that when the density is estimated rather than a known constant, this version of alpha tended to overestimate the actual degree of aggregation. He provided a revised formulation which corrects this error.\nThere is a wide range of mathematical problems related to spatial ecological models, relating to spatial patterns and processes associated with chaotic phenomena, bifurcations and instability.\n\n\n"}

The album contains \"The Fabulous Baker Boy\" and \"Fruit Fairy.\" Buddy later also sang and wrote \"Tama Ka\" and \"Kahit Ano\" in the 1999 album, \"Natin99\".\n\nBuddy's bass-playing is prominently featured in the drum & bass opening track of the \"Natin99\" album, \"Sinturong Pangkaligtasan\". In \"Aloha Milkyway\" (the band's first international release), the songs were heavy with his bass work.\n\nA few years after the dissolution of the Eraserheads, Buddy Zabala continues to be a prolific musician. He plays bass for The Dawn and, of course, the renamed Eheads, Cambio. Intervening bands in which he was played were the Sun Valley Crew (together with fellow Eraserhead, Raimund Marasigan) and Twisted Halo (with Vin Dancel, Jason Caballa, Joey Odulio, and Mon Lopez.).\n\nFor his bass work for Cambio (\"Derby Light\") and Twisted Halo (\"In Loving Memory of the Fearless Exploits of the Bolo Brigade\"), Zabala was awarded by the NU Rock Awards as 2004 \"Bassist of the Year\".\n\nAside from playing with his bands and doing session work, he focuses his energy in helping younger generation of Pinoy rock bands by way of producing their albums. Some of these are Boldstar's \"\"You Must Have Been a Beautiful Something/What Are You, Really?\"\", Itchyworms' \"\"Little Monsters Under your Bed\"\" (with Romel Sanchez), 6 Cycle Mind's \"\"Panorama\"\", Moonstar 88's \"\"Todo Combo\"\", and Imago's \"\"Blush\"\".\n\nHe also works as co-producer with his Eraserheads and Cambio colleague, Raimund Marasigan; such as on Itchyworms' \"Noon Time Show,\" Twisted Halo's \"Twisted Halo EP\", Fatal Posporos' \"Paper View,\" Sugarfree's \"Dramachine,\" Cambio's \"Derby Light,\" and Imago's \"Take 2.\" He was also involved for Marasigan's recent \"Five on the Floor\" album for Sandwich's.\n\nZabala had also scored a number of movies, TV commercials, documentary shorts and stage plays.\n\nIn late 2015, Zabala replaced Hilera's bassist, Ivan Garcia who left the band due to personal reasons. A year later, Zabala left The Dawn due to unknown reasons and was replaced by the returning Carlos Balcells.\n\nStarted July 2017, working with Raymund Marasigan, currently working as producers for Coke Studio Philippines. Coke Studio Philippines is a brand new musical program that brings artists of different backgrounds and genres together to fuse their music into unique, new Pinoy sounds.

The White House Military Office is headed by the White House Military Office Director.\n\nToday's White House Military Office is an amalgamation of several previously independent offices and agencies. Military representation aiding Presidents predates the construction of the White House and originated with General George Washington's Aide-de-Camp, whose role as Personal Aide to the President has continued and is currently filled by the military aides to the President. These roles carry a wide variety of responsibilities, from critical military command and control missions to ceremonial duties at presidential events. The White House Garage was created by an act of Congress in 1909. Over the years it was transformed into a military organization and became a regular unit in 1963 by the name of the U.S. Army Transportation Agency (White House). It was later renamed the White House Transportation Agency.\n\nCamp David was established in 1942 to provide the President a safe and relaxing residence away from the White House. That same year, the White House Communications Agency was formed to assure that the President always had access to safe, secure, and reliable means of communication. Two years later, President Franklin D. Roosevelt called for the creation of the Presidential Pilot's Office (renamed the Presidential Airlift Group in 2001) to provide air transportation to the President and his staff.\n\nThe White House Medical Unit was established in the West Wing in 1945. The White House Mess, also contained in the West Wing, was established in 1951 and has been run by the Navy ever since. Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) was created in 1957 when President Dwight D. Eisenhower was vacationing in Newport, Rhode Island, and had to return to the White House on short notice. He flew the first portion of the trip aboard HMX-1.\n\nOn May 8, 2009, Louis Caldera, the Director of the White House Military Office, resigned amid controversy over the Air Force One photo op incident. His successor was announced on October 16, 2009, as George D. Mulligan Jr.\n\n\nThe WHMO is headed by a Director who oversees the policies involving Department of Defense assets. He ensures that White House requirements are clearly communicated to the WHMO Directorates and meet the highest standards of presidential quality.\n\nThe WHMO's operational units are the most visible element of the WHMO's support to the President. The WHMO units include the: White House Communications Agency, Presidential Airlift Group, White House Medical Unit, Camp David, Marine Helicopter Squadron One, Presidential Food Service, White House Transportation Agency, White House Social Aides, and Military Aides to the President. The Social Aides, of whom there are 40-45 at a time, are uniformed officers of the rank of 1st Lieutenant / Lieutenant, junior grade to Major / Lieutenant Commander, and have a purely social role, taking care of visitors to the White House. They are volunteers, serving perhaps two to four afternoons a month. The (permanent) Military Aides are Majors / Lieutenant Commanders and Lieutenant Colonels / Commanders, one from each of the five armed forces, and have the task of carrying the President's emergency satchel, the so-called nuclear football.\n\nThe White House Military Office also includes staff dedicated to Operations, Information and Technology Management, Financial Management and Comptroller, WHMO Counsel, and Security. Together the WHMO's entities provide essential service to the President as well as help assure the continuity of the presidency.\n\nMost uniformed personnel assigned to the WHMO are eligible to wear the Presidential Service Badge after \"a period of at least one year.\"\n\nThe White House Military Office is the subject of an episode of \"Major Dad\" titled \"General Disturbance\", which originally aired on April 9, 1993. In it, General Marcus Craig (Jon Cypher) becomes the new Deputy Director of WHMO and his whole staff, including Major John MacGillis (Gerald McRaney), is transferred to Washington, DC with him.\n\n\n"}

Known for most of its length as Roscoe Rowe Boulevard, the highway runs from MD 450 in Annapolis north to Bestgate Road in Parole. MD 70 is the primary highway connecting U.S. Route 50 (US 50) and US 301 with downtown Annapolis. The highway also serves several sets of Maryland state government offices and Navy–Marine Corps Memorial Stadium. MD 70 was constructed in the mid-1950s contemporaneously with the US 50 freeway. The highway was extended north to Bestgate Road in the early 1990s.\n\nMD 70 begins at an intersection with MD 450 (College Avenue) in downtown Annapolis. This intersection is next to Government House, the residence of the Governor of Maryland, and one block north of the Maryland State House. MD 70 heads northwest for two blocks as Bladen Street, a four-lane divided boulevard that passes between state office buildings, including the offices of members of the Maryland General Assembly. At Calvert Street, the highway's name changes to Roscoe Rowe Boulevard. A two-lane ramp splits from southbound MD 70 just south of the southern end of the highway's bridge over College Creek, the point at which maintenance responsibility changes from the city of Annapolis to the state. The highway passes between several sets of government offices, including the Maryland Court of Appeals and the Maryland State Archives, leading up to its intersection with MD 435 (Taylor Avenue). MD 70 passes to the east of Navy–Marine Corps Memorial Stadium before crossing Weems Creek and leaving the city of Annapolis. The highway meets US 50/US 301/MD 2 (John Hanson Highway) at a partial cloverleaf interchange. Beyond the interchange, MD 70 curves to the west and intersects Bestgate Road and Tidewater Colony Drive; the latter street leads to the historic home Howard's Inheritance. The highway continues along Bestgate Road and becomes a four-lane road with a center left-turn lane before reaching its northern terminus at an arbitrary point west of Compton Drive and Willie Drive. Bestgate Road continues west as a county highway toward the Westfield Annapolis shopping mall in the center of Parole.\n\nMD 70 from College Avenue to US 50 and US 301 is named for Roscoe C. Rowe, the mayor of Annapolis from 1949 until his 1952 death. Rowe was credited with organizing the city of Annapolis's financial contribution to construct the boulevard and for persuading the Maryland State Roads Commission to finance the construction of the bridge across College Creek. Construction of MD 70 began from US 50, then also under construction, to Weems Creek, including the bridge over the creek, in October 1952. Construction on the highway resumed in May 1954; the section from Weems Creek to College Avenue was completed in November 1954, five months after the US 50 freeway opened from MD 450 to MD 2 east of the Severn River. The boulevard's interchange with US 50 was originally a trumpet interchange. MD 70's southern end was originally a one-way pair; traffic leaving Annapolis followed Bladen Street from College Avenue toward College Creek and traffic entering Annapolis veered south onto Northwest Street to end at Church Circle. Bladen Street was expanded to a two-way boulevard in 1983. MD 70 was extended north to its present terminus and its junction with US 50 and US 301 was changed to a partial cloverleaf interchange in 1991. The state highway's bridges over Weems Creek and College Creek were replaced between 2004 and 2006.\n\nMD 70 has two existing auxiliary routes and one former route. All three routes were established in 2002 along county highways relocated as part of the extension of MD 70 north to Bestgate Road.\n\n"}

{"id": "2148069", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2148069", "title": "Social peer-to-peer processes", "text": "Social peer-to-peer processes\n\nSocial peer-to-peer processes are interactions with a peer-to-peer dynamic. These peers can be humans or computers. Peer-to-peer (P2P) is a term that originated from the popular concept of the P2P distributed computer application architecture which partitions tasks or workloads between peers. This application structure was popularized by file sharing systems like Napster, the first of its kind in the late 1990s.\n\nThe concept has inspired new structures and philosophies in many areas of human interaction. P2P human dynamic affords a critical look at current authoritarian and centralized social structures. Peer-to-peer is also a political and social program for those who believe that in many cases, peer-to-peer modes are a preferable option.\n\nP2P is a specific form of relational dynamic, based on the assumed equipotency of its participants, organized through the free cooperation of equals in view of the performance of a common task, for the creation of a common good, with forms of decision making and autonomy that are widely distributed throughout the network.\n\nThere are several fundamental aspects of social P2P processes:\n\nPeer production does not produce commodities for exchange value and does not use the price mechanism or corporate hierarchy to determine the allocation of resources. It must, therefore, be distinguished from both the capitalist market (though it can be linked and embedded in the broader market) and from production through state and corporate planning; as a mode of governance it differs from traditional linear hierarchies; and as a mode of property it differs from both traditional private property and state-based collective public property; it is rather the common property of its producers and users and the whole of humankind. Unlike private property, peer property is inclusive rather than exclusive — its nature is to share ownership as widely, rather than as narrowly, as possible.\n\nP2P processes are not structureless but are characterized by dynamic and changing structures that adapt themselves to phase changes. Its rules are not derived from external authority, as in hierarchical systems, but are generated from within. It does not deny ‘authority’, but only fixed forced hierarchy, and therefore accepts authority based on expertise, initiation of the project, etc. P2P may be the first true meritocracy. P2P eliminates most, if not all, barriers to entry. The threshold for participation is kept as low as possible. Equipotency means that there is no prior formal filtering for participation, but rather that it is the immediate practice of cooperation which determines the expertise and level of participation. Communication is not top-down and based on strictly defined reporting rules, but feedback is systemic, integrated into the protocol of the cooperative system. Techniques of 'participation capture' and other social accounting make automatic cooperation the default scheme of the project. Personal identity becomes partly generated by the contribution to the common project. P2P characteristics have been studied by Howard Rheingold \"et al.\"'s Cooperation Project.\n\nP2P is a network, not a linear or 'pyramidal' hierarchy (though it may have elements of it); it is 'distributed', though it may have elements of centralization and 'decentralization'; intelligence is not located at any center, but everywhere within the system. Assumed equipotency means that P2P systems start from the premise that ‘it doesn’t know where the needed resource will be located’, it assumes that ‘everybody’ can cooperate, and does not use formal rules in advance to determine its participating members. Participants are expected to self-select the module that corresponds best to their expertise. Equipotency, i.e. the capacity to cooperate, is verified in the process of cooperation itself. Validation of knowledge, acceptance of processes, are determined by the collective through the use of digital rules which are embedded in the project's basic protocol. Cooperation must be free, not forced, and not based on neutrality (i.e. the buying of cooperation in a monetary system). It exists to produce something. It enables the widest possible participation. These are a number of characteristics that we can use to describe P2P systems ‘in general’, and in particular as it emerges in the human lifeworld. Whereas participants in hierarchical systems are subject to the panoptism of the select few who control the vast majority, in P2P systems, participants have access to holoptism, the ability for any participant to see the whole.\n\nThe first requirement to facilitate the emergence of peer-to-peer processes is the existence of a technological infrastructure that enables distributed access to fixed capital. Individual computers that enable a universal machine capable of executing any logical task are a form of distributed fixed capital, available at low cost to many producers. The internet, as a point to point network, was specifically designed for participation by the edges (computer users) without the use of obligatory hubs. Although it is not fully in the hands of its participants, the internet is controlled through distributed governance, and outside the complete hegemony of particular private or state actors. The Internet's hierarchical elements, such as the stacked IP protocols and Domain Name System, do not deter participation. Viral communicators, or meshworks, are a logical extension of the internet. With this methodology, devices create their own networks through the use of excess capacity, bypassing the need for a pre-existing infrastructure. Wireless community networks, Open Spectrum advocacy, file-serving television, and alternative meshwork-based telecommunication infrastructures are exemplary of this trend.\n\nThe second requirement is alternative information and communication systems which allow for autonomous communication between cooperating agents. The web (in particular the Writeable Web and the Web 2.0 that is in the process of being established) allows for the universal autonomous production, dissemination, and 'consumption' of written material while the associated podcasting and webcasting developments create an 'alternative information and communication infrastructure' for audio and audiovisual creation. The existence of such an infrastructure enables autonomous content production that may be distributed without the intermediary of the classic publishing and broadcasting media (though new forms of mediation may arise).\n\nThe third requirement is the existence of a 'software' infrastructure for autonomous global cooperation. A growing number of collaborative tools, such as blogs and wikis, embedded in social networking software facilitate the creation of trust and social capital, making it possible to create global groups that can create use-value without the intermediary of manufacturing or distribution by for-profit enterprises.\n\nThe fourth requirement is a legal infrastructure that enables the creation of use-value and protects it from private appropriation. The General Public License (which prohibits the appropriation of software code), the related Open Source Initiative, and certain versions of the Creative Commons license fulfill this role. They enable the protection of common use-value and use viral characteristics to spread. GPL and related material can only be used in projects that in turn put their adapted source code in the public domain.\n\nThe fifth requirement is cultural. The diffusion of mass intellectuality, (i.e. the distribution of human intelligence) and associated changes in ways of feeling and being (ontology), ways of knowing (epistemology) and value constellations (axiology) have been instrumental in creating the type of cooperative individualism needed to sustain an ethos which can enable P2P projects.\n\nThere are two important aspects to the emergence of P2P in the economic sphere. On the one hand, as a format for peer production processes, it is emerging as a 'third mode of production' based on the cooperation of autonomous agents. Indeed, if the first mode of production was laissez-faire based capitalism, and the second mode was the model of a centrally-planned economy, then the third mode is defined neither by the motor of profit, nor by central planning: to allocate resources and make decisions, it does not use market and pricing mechanisms, or managerial commands, but instead uses social relations. Peer production is a significant part of the mainstream economy, even if it is not much advertised as such in mainstream economic literature.\n\nDespite significant differences, P2P and the capitalist market are highly interconnected. P2P is dependent on the market and the market is dependent on P2P. Peer production produces use-value through mostly immaterial production, without directly providing an income for its producers. Participants cannot live from peer production, though they derive meaning and value from it.\n\nThe market and capitalism are also dependent on P2P. Capitalism has become a system relying on distributed networks, in particular on the P2P infrastructure in computing and communication. Productivity is highly reliant on cooperative teamwork, most often organized in ways that are derivative of peer production's governance. The support given by major IT companies to open-source development is a testimony to the use derived from even the new common property regimes. The general business model seems to be that businesses use the P2P infrastructure, and create a surplus value through services, which can be packaged for exchange value. For-profit enterprises mostly use partial implementations of P2P. Amazon built itself around user reviews, eBay lives on a platform of worldwide distributed auctions, and Google is constituted by user-generated content. Value creation today is no longer confined to the enterprise, but beholden to the mass intellectuality of knowledge workers, who through their lifelong learning/experiencing and systemic connectivity, constantly innovate within and without the enterprise. Yet more recently, in the last decade, peer-to-peer exchanges have become even more prevalent in the so-called \"sharing economy\", also termed an \"access economy\" or a \"peer exchange economy.\" For instance, businesses such as Uber, Lyft, and Airbnb are all based on peer-to-peer physical exchanges. This sharing economy is projected by some analysts to encompass $335 billion by 2025.\n\nPeer-to-peer systems contribute to more specific forms of distributed capitalism. The massive use of open source software in business, enthusiastically supported by venture capital and large IT companies such as IBM, is creating a distributed software platform that will drastically undercut the monopolistic rents enjoyed by companies such as Microsoft and Oracle, while Skype and VoIP will drastically redistribute the telecom infrastructure. It also points to a new business model that is 'beyond' products, focusing instead on services associated with the nominally free FS/OS software model. Industries are gradually transforming themselves to incorporate user-generated innovation, and new intermediation may occur around user-generated media. Many knowledge workers are choosing non-corporate paths and becoming mini-entrepreneurs, relying on an increasingly sophisticated participatory infrastructure, a kind of digital corporate commons.\n\nSocial P2P systems are different from market economy: neither market pricing nor managerial command are required for P2P processes to make decisions regarding the allocation of resources. There are further differences:\n\n\nMarkets do not function well for common needs that do not involve direct payment (national defense, general policing, education and public health). In addition, they fail to take into account negative externalities (the environment, social costs, future generations).\n\nIn \"The Political Economy of Peer Production\" Bauwens regards P2P phenomena as an emerging alternative to capitalist society. P2P economy may be seen as extending or already existing outside the sphere of free/open source software production and other non-rival immaterial goods. Peer production effectively enables the free cooperation of producers, who have access to their own means of production, and the resulting use-value of the projects supersedes for-profit alternatives.\n\nHistorically, though forces of higher productivity may be temporarily embedded in the old productive system, they ultimately lead to deep upheavals and reconstitutions of the political economy. The emergence of capitalist modes within the feudal system is a case in point. This is particularly significant because leading sectors of the for-profit economy are deliberately slowing down productive growth (through patents and monopolization) and trying to outlaw P2P production and sharing practices.\n\nGovernments of countries are composed of a specialized and privileged body of individuals, who monopolize political decision-making. Their function is to enforce existing laws, legislate new ones, and arbitrate conflicts via their monopoly on violence. Legislation can be open to the general citizenry through open source governance, allowing policy development to benefit from the collected wisdom of the people as a whole.\n\nMichel Bauwens has stated, that society is not a peer group with an a priori consensus, but rather a decentralized structure of competing groups and representative democracy cannot be replaced entirely by peer governance.\n\nPeer projects which evolve beyond a certain scale and start facing issues of decisions about scarce resources, will probably adopt some representational mechanisms. Representative and bureaucratic decision-making can and will in some places be replaced by global governance networks which may be self-governed to a large extent, but in any case, it will and should incorporate more and more Multistakeholder Models (i.e. collaborative e-democracy), which strives to include all groups that could be affected. This group-based partnership model is different, but related in spirit, to the individual-based peer governance, because they share an ethos of participation.\n\nMany new movements are taking on P2P organizational formats, such as the alter-globalization movement and the \"Occupy\" movement (i.e. Occupy Wall Street). The movements see itself as a network of networks that combines players from a wide variety of fields and opinion, who, despite the fact that they do not see eye to eye in all things, manage to unite around a common platform of action around certain key events.\n\nThey are able to mobilize vast numbers of people from every continent, without having at their disposal any of the traditional news media, such as television, radio or newspapers. Rather, they rely almost exclusively on the P2P technologies described above. Thus, Internet media are used for communication and learning on a continuous basis, prior to the mobilizations, and also during the mobilizations.\n\nIndependent Internet media platforms such as Indymedia, as well as the skillful use of mobile phones, are used for real-time response management, undertaken by small groups that use buddy-list technologies, and sometimes open-source programs that have been explicitly designed for political activism such as TextMob.\n\nMany reports have appeared, including those described in Howard Rheingold's Smart Mobs, about the political significance of SMS in organizing successful protests and ‘democratic revolutions’. The network model allows for a more fluid organization that does not fix any group in a permanent adversarial position. Various temporary coalitions are created on an ad hoc basis depending on the issues.\n\nThe following is a list of individuals who have made contributions to the peer-to-peer paradigm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMIT Press, 2004 (power as embedded in the digital protocols governing networked systems)\n\n"}

In the mid-1960s he was a professor and head of the Department of Aeronautics at San Bernardino Valley College and an experienced pilot of midget air racers. He flew a pair of modified de Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunk aircraft, renamed \"Super Chipmunks\" (FAA registration numbers N13A, N13Y) and occasionally a third aircraft N1804Q (which is still flying today), before an estimated audience of 80 million people over 20 years and appeared in more than 200 motion picture features, documentaries and television commercials. The aircraft were recognizable for their red, white and blue livery and Pennzoil corporate sponsorship.\n\nScholl held four FAA certificates. He was an Airline Transport Pilot in multi-engine land and sea planes, with commercial privileges in airplane single engine land and airplane single engine sea, helicopters, and gliders. He held certificates as both a flight instructor and ground instructor. In addition, he was also a certificated airframe and power plant mechanic with an inspection authorization. In 1976 Scholl earned a Ph.D. in Aviation Management. He taught aeronautics at San Bernardino Valley College for 18 years, eventually becoming head of the department.\n\nScholl founded an aerobatics school and maintenance facility at Flabob Airport in Riverside, California. He converted it to a full service fixed-base operation (FBO) when he moved it to Rialto Municipal Airport, then known as Miro Field, in Rialto, California in 1978. He produced several highly successful air shows at Miro Field, attracting hundreds of thousands of spectators. Miro Field has since been renamed Art Scholl Memorial Field in his honor. Scholl's company, Art Scholl Aviation, continues to operate there and offers fuel, aircraft maintenance services, and aircraft mock-ups used in film and TV production.\n\nScholl's signature aircraft were his two Super Chipmunks; he bought his first in 1963, and his second one in 1968. His skill as a licensed aircraft mechanic helped Scholl in modifying the aircraft extensively; clipping its wings, adding retractable landing gear, converting them to single-seat, adding an autopilot and a much bigger engine. At the height of his popularity as an air show performer in the 1970s Scholl flew two Super Chipmunks, basing one on the East Coast and one on the West Coast. His Super Chipmunk was licensed to various model manufacturers for both flying and static models; collectors now actively seek the Cox control line model. Although less widely recognized, Scholl also owned and flew a Pitts S-2A in the same red, white, and blue livery. Another Art Scholl signature was his dog, \"Aileron\", who occasionally flew in the Super Chipmunk's cockpit with Scholl in his air show performances. Aileron was hugely popular with the crowds.\n\nBob Hoover, the World War II fighter pilot, former test pilot and fellow aerobatic pilot, was a close friend of Scholl. Hoover was often at Scholl's Rialto facility, where he also maintained a hangar for his aircraft.\n\nScholl's aerial camera work appeared in many Ridgewood school commercials, television shows and films, including \"The Right Stuff\", \"The Great Waldo Pepper\", \"Blue Thunder\", \"The A-Team\", \"CHiPs\", \"Iron Eagle\", and \"Top Gun\", his final work in a motion picture. The last line of credits at the end of the movie \"Top Gun\" states \"This film is dedicated to the memory of Art Scholl.\"\n\nScholl was a member of the five-person aerobatic team representing the United States in international competition from 1963 through 1972. He flew competition at Moscow in 1966; Magdeburg, East Germany, 1968; Hullavington, England, 1970, and Salon de Provence, France. In 1974, he won the U.S. National Aerobatic Championship in a Pitts S-2A.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Judy, who helped run his business and manage his performances, as well as two grown sons, John and David, by a former marriage. , Art Scholl Memorial Field was scheduled for closing by the City of Rialto, to make way for real estate development. Judy Scholl closed Art Scholl Aviation, the fixed-base operator at Rialto, at the end of August 2014, as the airfield ceased operations. \"The Rialto airport was scheduled to close in the mid 2000s with plans for the site to be redeveloped into residential and retail property. The downturn in the economy and lack of development delayed the closure.\"\n\n Art Scholl's Super Chipmunk N13A was sold in April 1972 to J. Reid Garrison, FBO operator at the Oconee Airport in Clemson, South Carolina, and moved to the Anderson Municipal Airport in Anderson, South Carolina, when Garrison relocated his business there in the 1980s. Super Chipmunk N13Y went to the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C., in 1987.\n\n"}

{"id": "2148125", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2148125", "title": "Maryland Route 528", "text": "Maryland Route 528\n\nMaryland Route 528 (MD 528) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland. Known for most of its length as Coastal Highway, the state highway runs from the southern terminus of its companion route, unsigned Maryland Route 378, in downtown Ocean City north to the Delaware state line at the northern edge of the resort town, where the highway continues as Delaware Route 1 (DE 1). MD 528 and MD 378 are the primary north–south streets of Ocean City, where they provide access to countless hotels, condos, restaurants, shops, and other businesses catering to tourists. These highways experience heavy seasonal traffic and provide access to hurricane evacuation routes, which include U.S. Route 50 (US 50), MD 90, and DE 54. Both Baltimore Avenue and Philadelphia Avenue date back to the founding of Ocean City in the late 19th century. MD 378 was assigned to Baltimore Avenue in 1927 and MD 528 was assigned to Philadelphia Avenue in 1933. MD 528 was extended north of 15th Street to the Delaware state line in 1939. Both highways were rebuilt and widened in the 1950s. MD 528 was expanded to a six-lane divided highway north of the one-way pair in the late 1980s.\n\nMD 528 and MD 378 both have their southern termini at the intersection of Baltimore Avenue and South 1st Street at the southern end of Ocean City north of the Ocean City Inlet. Baltimore Avenue continues south and then turns east as South 2nd Street toward the Hugh T. Cropper Inlet Parking Lot that serves attractions on the Ocean City Boardwalk along the Atlantic Ocean, including Trimper's Rides and the Ocean City Life-Saving Station. From the southern terminus, MD 528 heads west on South 1st Street and then north as Philadelphia Avenue, while MD 378 heads north as Baltimore Avenue. The two state highways form a one-way pair, with MD 378 carrying three lanes of northbound traffic and MD 528 carrying three lanes of southbound traffic. Both streets intersect South Division Street, which was the site of the railroad terminus in Ocean City and is currently the site of Sunset Park and the South Division Street Transit Center, and Worcester Street, which was the site of the first automobile bridge to the resort in 1916.\n\nMD 528 and MD 378 head north through the downtown area of Ocean City, where they meet the eastern terminus of US 50 at North Division Street. North Division Street between MD 528 and MD 378 is one-way eastbound, so traffic coming from the south uses North 1st Street, which is one-way westbound and designated MD 378A, to access US 50 west. MD 528 and MD 378 continue north to 9th Street, which is one-way westbound and designated MD 378B. MD 528 becomes two-way at 9th Street. MD 378 continues north as a two-lane street northbound to 15th Street, where the state highway turns west to reach its northern terminus at MD 528. Baltimore Avenue continues north of 15th Street as a two-way municipal street to its northern end at 33rd Street.\nMD 528 continues north from 9th Street as a divided highway with two lanes northbound and three lanes southbound. The state highway gains a third lane northbound at MD 378 (15th Street). At 17th Street, MD 528 assumes its form for the remainder of its course to the Delaware state line: three lanes in each direction plus a continuous combined right turn, bus, and bicycle lane in both directions. The road heads into the Midtown section of Ocean City, which is home to numerous restaurants and nightlife, at 28th Street. After passing the Jolly Roger Amusement Park at 30th Street, MD 528 meets 33rd Street, which is one-way westbound coming from the northern end of Baltimore Avenue. North of 33rd Street, MD 528 becomes Coastal Highway, the only through highway on the barrier island that is lined with numerous hotels and businesses. The state highway passes the Roland E. Powell Convention Center at 40th Street and intersects the eastern terminus of MD 90 (Ocean City Expressway) at 62nd Street. MD 528 continues through commercial areas and heads into North Ocean City at 91st Street, where it passes numerous condos along with the Gold Coast Mall at 112th Street. Farther north, the route runs past more businesses and hotels, heading east of the 144th Street Transit Center before it reaches the Delaware state line at 146th Street, two blocks east of the Fenwick Island Light. Coastal Highway continues into Fenwick Island as DE 1, which meets the eastern terminus of DE 54 one block north of the state line. Throughout Ocean City, MD 528 serves as the divider between the Bayside area to the west and the Oceanside area to the east.\n\nAs the main north-south road in Ocean City, MD 528 experiences heavy traffic in the summer months as the resort town sees a large number of visitors and seasonal residents. The route also provides access to hurricane evacuation routes leading out of Ocean City, including US 50, MD 90, and DE 54. MD 528 is a part of the main National Highway System from US 50 to the Delaware state line.\n\nBaltimore Avenue and Philadelphia Avenue date back to the founding of Ocean City in 1875. Both avenues originally extended from South Division Street to North Division Street. The streets were later extended north as far as 15th Street. Baltimore Avenue served as the main thoroughfare of Ocean City until Philadelphia Avenue and Coastal Highway assumed predominance in the 1950s. MD 378 was assigned to Baltimore Avenue, which was paved from US 213 (Worcester Street) to 15th Street by 1927. MD 528 was assigned to Philadelphia Avenue when that street was rebuilt between US 213 and 15th Street in 1933. MD 528 was extended north to the Delaware state line when Coastal Highway was completed in 1939.\n\nIn the 1940s, traffic in Ocean City increased so much there was a movement to make Baltimore and Philadelphia Avenues one-way in the downtown area, a change that was implemented by 1948. Traffic volume in Ocean City increased even more following the completion of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in 1952, leading to expansion of the city's north–south arterials. MD 378 was widened along its entire length in 1951 and 1952. MD 528 was widened to four lanes along its entire length in 1953 and 1954. Both state highways were extended to their present southern termini at that time. The first portion of MD 528 to be expanded to a divided highway was around the intersection with MD 90; the highway between 60th and 63rd Streets was reconstructed by 1978. Two sections of six-lane divided highway were completed around 1989: from 25th Street to 65th Street, and from 85th Street to 122nd Street. By 1991, MD 528 was divided highway from 25th Street to the Delaware state line. The segment of Philadelphia Avenue from 9th Street to 25th Street was changed from a five- to six-lane highway with a center turn lane to a divided highway in 2001. \n\nA pedestrian safety project aimed to reduce jaywalking will install a dune-style fence in the median of MD 528, with the first phase to take place between 41st Street/Convention Center Drive and MD 90. Construction on the first phase was expected to begin in January 2017 and be finished by Memorial Day of that year, but was delayed after the only bid came in over the $4.5 million budget. Construction on the first phase began on November 7, 2017 and was completed in May 2018. The second phase will build the fence between 26th Street and 41st Street/Convention Center Drive while the third phase will construct the fence between 9th Street and 26th Street. In the future, the fence will be built between MD 90 and the Delaware border.\n\nMaryland Route 378 is a unsigned highway in Ocean City that follows portions of Baltimore Avenue and 15th Street from the southern terminus of MD 528 at the southern end of Ocean City north to MD 528 north of the downtown area of Ocean City. Because MD 378 essentially functions as the northbound direction of MD 528 in downtown Ocean City, the state highway is covered in more detail in the main sections of this article. MD 378 has two auxiliary routes:\n\nMD 378 from US 50 to MD 378B and all of MD 378B are part of the main National Highway System.\n\nJunction list\n\n"}

{"id": "2148128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2148128", "title": "National Republican Greek League", "text": "National Republican Greek League\n\nThe National Republican Greek League (, \"Ethnikós Dimokratikós Ellinikós Sýndesmos\" (EDES)) was one of the major resistance groups formed during the Axis occupation of Greece during World War II.\n\nThe largest of the non-communist resistance groups, its military wing, the National Groups of Greek Guerrillas (Εθνικές Ομάδες Ελλήνων Ανταρτών, \"Ethnikés Omádes Ellínon Antartón\" (ΕΟΕΑ)) concentrated its military activities in Epirus. From 1943 onwards, EDES came into confrontation with the communist-led National Liberation Front, beginning a series of civil conflicts that would lead to the Greek Civil War.\n\nThe National Republican Greek League was founded on 9 September 1941 by a former army officer, Colonel Napoleon Zervas, a centrist who had been expelled from the army after the failed pro-Venizelist coup d'état of 1935, and two of his friends, Leonidas Spais and Ilias Stamatopoulos.\n\nLike many other resistance movements founded during that time, the political orientation of the National Republican Greek League was Republican, with a strong dislike towards the exiled king, George II, and featured some vague leftist-socialist tendencies. In the aftermath of the four-year right-wing Metaxas dictatorship, which was strongly supported by the king, the monarchy was almost universally rejected, while social ideals for \"social fairness\" became the vogue among the various resistance groups.\n\nThe founding charter of EDES explicitly demanded the \"establishment in Greece of a Republican regime, of Socialist form\", the \"revelation [...] of the treason of former King George II and the gang of the so-called \"4th of August\" Dictatorship\", calling for a thorough cleansing of the state and Greek social and public life from anyone \"who has not proven a National Republican [and] socialist conscience through actions\". The charter acknowledged the prominent exiled Venizelist general Nikolaos Plastiras as its nominal political head, but due to his exile in France they failed to take his consent beforehand. For the time being, no reference to armed opposition against the occupying forces was made in the text.\n\nOn the same day, Komninos Pyromaglou, a friend and assistant of Plastiras, left Nice, where Plastiras resided, for Greece. He was authorize by the general to form, on his behalf, a republican organization with socialist content\", and prepare to turn both \"against the Occupier\" and against a return of the monarchy. After his arrival in Athens on 23 September, Pyromaglou came into contact with Republican circles, and after contacting Zervas took EDES' command. In October, a five-member Executive Committee was founded, with Pyromaglou as Plastiras' representative as General Secretary and Zervas as a simple member.\n\nAs the organization grew, it succeeded in establishing links with the British Headquarters in Cairo, with a view to receiving funds, weapons and guidance. Under British pressure which at the time strongly supported the Greek monarchy, Zervas was forced to send a statement of loyalty to King George II in March 1942. This marked a silent breach with the vitriolic anti-monarchist attacks of the past months, and marked EDES's slow slide towards a more pro-monarchist stance.\n\nLike most similar groups, EDES was initially limited to Athens. Having the support of many prominent Venizelist and Republican military figures, EDES came into contact with EAM and tried to establish some form of cooperation. The negotiations failed over the demands of the Communists for a merger of EDES with EAM and their distrust of Zervas' pro-British attitudes.\n\nOn 23 July 1942, after intense British pressure and more than a month after the official appearance of the military wing of EAM, the Greek People's Liberation Army (ELAS), Zervas, accompanied by Pyromaglou and a handful of companions, set out for the Valtos Mountains in Aetolia-Acarnania, an area with long traditions of guerrilla warfare stretching back to the Ottoman period. From then and until the end of the Occupation, Epirus would be the primary area of operations of the EDES \"andartes\".\n\nSupported by British parachute drops, EDES quickly gathered some 100 fighters. The first major operation of EDES was \"Operation Harling\", the destruction of the Gorgopotamos viaduct by a joint force of British SOE commandos, and EDES and ELAS forces. While the successful operation, one of the greatest sabotage acts in occupied Europe, greatly boosted the prestige of the nascent Resistance, it also caused a significant rift between EDES and ELAS: the British loudly proclaimed and lauded Zervas' role in the operation, while ignoring the contribution – numerically far greater – of the leftist ELAS forces. While the rift was healed by British mediation, it presaged the problems that would appear in the future.\n\n1942\n1943\n1944\n\nThe left wing Greek People's Liberation Army on various occasions accused its rival organizations, and particularly EDES, for collaboration with the occupation forces. However, this accusation was as yet unfounded, at least concerning EDES' guerilla branch. Moreover, during the armed conflicts between ELAS and EDES in Athens, a propaganda war was launched with ELAS accusing EDES of collaboration, mainly due to gaining plausibility from the explicit exemption of EDES from German propaganda attacks. EDES was accusing ELAS for soviet perspective and crimes against non-communists.\n\nOn the other hand, Stylianos Gonatas, initially a political leader of EDES in Athens, won the peculiar enmity of the organization because he supported the collaborationist Security Battalions and encouraged young officers to join their ranks, which led to hostility of the EAM groups towards him. The 12th Army of Nazi Germany attempted for a short time to coopt the EDES forces, and to use them against the ELAS, but this attempt failed and in July 1944 the EDES launched new attacks.\n\nThese internal conflicts caused rivalry between resistance groups and eventually escalated into civil war. In October 1943, ELAS launched an attack on EDES. These attacks triggered a civil war that would last until February 1944. After that, a fragile truce was established, which lasted until December, two months after the Liberation. Then, while the ELAS of Athens attempted to overthrow the government, other units stormed the EDES positions in Epirus. The latter was defeated and the remaining forces were evacuated to Corfu. After the defeat of the ELAS in Athens (January 1945), EDES forces returned to Epirus, where part of them got involved to the expulsion of the Cham Albanians.\n\n"}
{"id": "2148130", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2148130", "title": "See of Tyre", "text": "See of Tyre\n\nThe see of Tyre was one of the most ancient dioceses in Christianity. The existence of a Christian community there already in the time of Saint Paul is mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles. Seated at Tyre, which was the capital of the Roman province of Phoenicia Prima, the bishopric was a metropolitan see. Its position was briefly challenged by the see of Berytus in the mid-5th century; but after 480/1 the metropolitan of Tyre established himself as the first (\"protothronos\") of all the metropolitans subject to the Patriarch of Antioch.\n\nIn the summer of 2017 a Greek inscription, five-metres long, naming Irenaeus as bishop of Tyre, was found west of the Sea of Galilee, in an excavation co-directed by historian Jacob Ashkenazi and archaeologist Mordechai Aviam. Since the inscription provides the date of the church’s completion as 445, it gives credence to a date as early as 444 CE for his ordination.\n\nCommunion with the see of Rome was broken following the East–West Schism. When the Crusaders conquered Tyre, the Eastern Orthodox archbishop withdrew to Constantinople and a Latin named Eudes was appointed archbishop, but he died in 1124, the same year in which the Crusaders succeeded in taking the city.\n\nThe most notable of the Latin archbishops of Tyre of this time was the historian William of Tyre, who served from 1175 to 1185.\n\nTyre then belonged to the Kingdom of Jerusalem, not the more northerly Principality of Antioch. On the basis of the Pentarchy system, the Latin Patriarch of Antioch claimed the right to appoint the archbishop, which was exercised by the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem. Pope Innocent II adjudicated the dispute in favour of Jerusalem on the basis of a decree of Pope Paschal II granting King Baldwin the right to make all sees conquered from the Muslims subject to Jerusalem. It was the practice to choose as Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem the archbishop of Tyre or of Caesarea in Palaestina.\n\nIn 1187, after Saladin's invasion, Tyre was the only city remaining in Crusader hands and was at one point considered as the new capital of the kingdom. It lost that appellation to Acre, but it remained the site of the coronation of the king, and the archbishop was given the responsibility of officiating at the coronation.\n\nStarting with Sultan Baibars in 1254, the Islamic chieftains declared jihad on the Crusaders and slowly started exterminating the remaining Christian communities on the coastlands. The last archbishops, John and Bonacourt, devoted their rule to forestalling the Mamluk conquest, attempting to obtain the freedom of enslaved Christians, caring for refugees, and preparing for the coming assault. After a long siege, the city was captured by the Mamluks in 1291. The city was mostly evacuated by the time the Mamluks arrived, but the remaining population, including the archbishop, were killed or enslaved. The churches were torn down, and the archdiocese became titular; only in the 18th and 19th centuries was a new archbishop appointed to protect the newly restored pilgrim routes. Due to the ongoing conflict and dislocations in modern Lebanon and the decline of influence of Christianity there, the see has remained vacant again since 1984.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2148134", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2148134", "title": "Space music", "text": "Space music\n\nSpace music, also called spacemusic, is a subgenre of new-age music and is described as \"tranquil, hypnotic and moving\". It is derived from ambient music and is associated with lounge music, easy listening, and elevator music.\n\nAccording to Stephen Hill, co-founder of a radio show called \"Hearts of Space,\" the term is used to describe music that evokes a feeling of contemplative spaciousness. Hill states that space music can range in character, the sonic texture of the music can be simple or complex, it can be instrumental or electronic, it may lack conventional melodic, harmonic, or rhythmic features, and may be less concerned with the formal compositional schemes associated with other styles of music. Hill proposes that space music can be found within a wide range of genres. Space music may have influences from western classical, world, Celtic, traditional and experimental music.\n\nHill believes that space music can evoke a \"continuum of spatial imagery and emotion\", which can be beneficial for introspection, and for developing, through a practice of \"deep listening\", an awareness of the spatiality of sound phenomenon. This type of psychonautic listening can produce a subtle trance-like state in certain individuals which can in turn lead to sensations of flying, floating, cruising, gliding, or hovering.\n\nHill states that space music is used by some individuals for both background enhancement and foreground listening, often with headphones, to enable states of relaxation, contemplation, inspiration, and generally peaceful expansive moods; it may promote health through relaxation, atmospherics for bodywork therapies, and effectiveness of meditation. Space music appears in many film soundtracks and is commonly played in planetariums.\n\nAccording to Hill space music is an eclectic music produced almost exclusively by independent labels and it occupies a small niche in the marketplace, supported and enjoyed by a relatively small audience of loyal enthusiastic listeners.\n\nAllmusic defines space music as a subgenre of New Age music. Similarly, mainstream retailer Barnes & Noble, independent online music retailer CDBaby, and RealNetwork's music download service Rhapsody all classify space music as a subgenre of new-age music. Rhapsody's editorial staff writes in their music genre description for space music (listed as a subgenre of new-age music) that \"New Age composers have looked upward for inspiration, creating an abstract notion of the sounds of interstellar music.\"\n\nStephen Hill, co-founder of \"Music from the Hearts of Space\" (syndicated nationally in the USA on National Public Radio, uses the phrase \"contemplative music, broadly defined\" as an overview to describe the music played on his station, along with the term \"spacemusic\".\nHe states that the \"genre spans historical, ethnic, and contemporary styles\", and that it combines elements from many cultures and genres, blended with varieties of acoustic and electronic ambient music, \"woven into a seamless sequence unified by sound, emotion, and spatial imagery.\" In his essay \"New age Music made Simple\", and in introducing the 200th broadcast of the \"Hearts of Space\" radio program, Hill has referred to space music as a sub-category of New Age.\n\nHill's partner Anna Turner (co-host and original co-producer of \"Music from the Hearts of Space\") wrote in her 1989 essay entitled \"Space Music\", that \"New Age Space music carries visions in its notes; it is transcendent inner and outer space music that opens, allows and creates space... this music speaks to our present moment, to the great allegory of moving out beyond our boundaries into space, and reflexively, to the unprecedented adventures of the psyche that await within.\"\n\nGerardo \"Pkx\" Martinez-Casas, original host, producer and creator of KUSF's 90.3 FM, University of San Francisco in California, \"Moondance (The Beyond Within)\" 1981– 198?, described space music as electronic, environmental and spiritual fine art fashion cosmic sounds as an aid and tool for cultural, contemplative, meditative, social and spiritual awareness.\n\nIn her book \"The New Age Music Guide\", author, editor and music critic P. J. Birosik classifies space music as a subgenre of new-age music, as does Dallas Smith, writer, teacher and recording artist in his essay \"New Age Jazz/Fusion\". Steven Halpern, noted recording artist and workshop leader writes that space music has been considered a synonym for new-age music: \" 'Space' is a vital dimension of new-age music; so much so that one of the early appellations for the genre was simply 'space music', referring both to its texture and to the state that it tended to evoke in the listener.\"\n\nJohn Diliberto, the host of the radio show, Echoes, and creator of WXPN's Star's End, has stated that space music is related to electronic music, as has Bay Area musician, composer and sound designer Robert Rich, who considers space music to be a combination of Electronic music influences from the 1970s with world music and \"modern compositional methods\".\nForest, host of Musical Starstreams refers to space music as a separate genre along with Ambient music, and others including dub, downtempo, trip hop, and acid jazz in the list of genres he calls \"exotic electronica\".\nSimilarly, WXPN Radio's Star's End, programming ambient music since 1976, on its website lists space music as a separate genre, along with Ambient, new-age, and others.\n\nSteve Sande, freelance writer for the San Francisco Chronicle considers space music to be \"Anything but New Age,\" and writes that \"spacemusic [is] also known as ambient, chill-out, mellow dub, down-tempo.\"\nIn the same article, he describes Stephen Hill's \"Hearts of Space\" spacemusic program as streaming ambient, electronic, world, new-age and classical music. In contrast to this, according to author and National Endowment for the Arts researcher Judith H. Balfe, \"Billboard\" editor Jerry Wood describes space music as one of several \"genres within the genre\" of new-age music.\n\nAs described by Stephen Hill, the predominant defining element of spacemusic is its contemplative nature. Within that overview, Hill's definition of space music includes a wide variety of styles, instrumentation and influences – both acoustic or electronic.\n\nMany space music recording artists specialize in electronic forms, evolving out of the traditional Kosmische musik of the Berlin School (also known as Krautrock).\n\nAuthor and classical music critic David Hurwitz describes Joseph Haydn's choral and chamber orchestra piece, \"The Creation\", composed in 1798, as space music, both in the sense of the sound of the music, (\"a genuine piece of 'space music' featuring softly pulsating high violins and winds above low cellos and basses, with nothing at all in the middle ... The space music gradually drifts towards a return to the movement's opening gesture ... \"); and in the manner of its composition, relating that Haydn conceived \"The Creation\" after discussing music and astronomy with William Herschel, oboist and astronomer (discoverer of the planet Uranus).\n\nIn 1928, the German composer Robert Beyer published a paper about \"Raummusik\" (spatial music), which is an entirely different sense of the term. Karlheinz Stockhausen, who became a colleague of Beyer in Cologne in 1953, used the expression \"space music\" in this sense when describing his early development as a composer: \"The first revolution occurred from 1952/53 as musique concrète, electronic tape music, and space music, entailing composition with transformers, generators, modulators, magnetophones, etc., the integration of all concrete and abstract (synthetic) possibilities within sound (also all noises) and the controlled projection of sound in space.\" In the sense meant here, he stated in 1967, \"Several have commented that my electronic music sounds 'like on a different star,' or 'like in outer space.' Many have said that when hearing this music, they have sensations as if flying at an infinitely high speed, and then again, as if immobile in an immense space.\" A number of Stockhausen's later compositions (not all of them electronic music) take outer space as their theme: \"Sternklang\" (Star Sound, 1971), \"Ylem\" (1972), \"Sirius\" (1975–77), several components of the opera-cycle \"Licht\" (\"Weltraum\" (Outer Space, 1991–92/1994), \"\" (1997), \"Komet\" (Comet, 1994/1999), \"\" (Lights—Waters, 1998–99)), and the so-called \"Urantia\" subcycle of \"Klang\" (Sound, 2006–2007), extending from its thirteenth \"hour\", \"\" to its twenty-first \"hour\" \"\". \n\nMusic historian Joseph Lanza described the emerging light music style during the early 1950s as a precursor to modern space music. He wrote that orchestra conductor Mantovani used new studio technologies to \"create sound tapestries with innumerable strings\" and in particular, \"the sustained hum of Mantovani's reverberated violins produced a sonic vaporizor foreshadowing the synthesizer harmonics of space music.\"\n\nJazz artist Sun Ra used the term to describe his music in 1956, when he stated that the music allowed him to translate his experience of the void of space into a language people could enjoy and understand.\n\nPhysicist Werner Meyer-Eppler had been inspired by Homer Dudley's 1948 invention of the Vocoder and began in 1951 to work with a device known as a Melochord, in conjunction with magnetic tape recorders, leading to a decade of working at the Studio for Electronic Music (WDR) specializing in \"elektronische Musik\" using magnetic tape recorders, sine wave generators and serial composition techniques.\n\nIn 1969, Miles Davis was introduced to the music of Stockhausen by young arranger and cellist, and later Grammy award winner, Paul Buckmaster, leading to a period of new creative exploration for Davis. Biographer J.K.Chambers wrote that \"The effect of Davis's study of Stockhausen could not be repressed for long. ... Davis's own 'space music,' shows Stockhausen's influence compositionally.\" His recordings and performances during this period were described as \"space music\" by fans, by music critic Leonard Feather, and by Buckmaster who stated: \"a lot of mood changes – heavy, dark, intense – definitely space music.\"\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Grateful Dead developed a new form of improvisational space music in their extended formless jam sessions during live concerts (which their fans referred to as \"Space\" though the band did not formally assign that title), and their experimental space music albums such as Aoxomoxoa, and later in the 1980s, Infrared Roses, and Grayfolded. Band member Phil Lesh released experimental space music recording \"Seastones\" with computer music pioneer Ned Lagin in 1975, one of the first albums to be issued in the innovative but commercially unsuccessful format SQ-Quadwith. Lagin used in real-time stage and studio performance of minicomputers driving real-time digital to analog converters, prior to the commercial availability of digital synthesizers in the early 1980s.\n\nThe Czech-American composer Václav Nelhýbel, released in 1974 a record named \"Outer Space: Music by Vaclav Nelybel\". From the liner notes: \"Ingenious use of echo, artificial reverberation and electronic alterations gives the music in this category a weird, spooky futuristic, ‘out of this world’ quality, well-suited to super-natural happenings of any kind. Piano, drums and electronic instruments are used to achieve the strange atmosphere and spatial sounds.\" Vaclav Nelhybel crafts a supernatural world, describing nebulae, meteors, star clusters and craters on Mars with sounds natural and manipulated to tell the story of cosmic space.\n\nBeginning in the early 1970s, the term \"space music\" was applied to some of the output of such artists as Vangelis, Jean-Michel Jarre, Klaus Schulze and Tangerine Dream, due to the transcendent cosmic feelings of space evoked by the sound of the music and enhanced by the use of the emerging new instrument, the synthesizer, and also in part to the \"outer space\" themes that are apparent in some of their works. These space music explorations diverged from traditional pop-song formats into longer less structured compositions. Following their early influence on the development of space music, Tangerine Dream later produced increasingly rock-influenced works that are not generally described as space music.\n\nIn 1971–72, Sun Ra brought his \"space music\" philosophy to UC Berkeley where he taught as artist-in-residence for the school year, creating notoriety among the students by devoting the second half-hour of each class to solo or band performances. In 1972, San Francisco public TV station KQED producer John Coney, producer Jim Newman, and screenwriter Joshua Smith worked with Sun Ra to produce a 30-minute documentary film, expanded into a feature film released in 1974, entitled \"Space is the Place\", featuring Sun Ra's Arkestra and filmed in Golden Gate Park.\n\nIn 1973, KPFA Berkeley, California radio producers Anna Turner and Stephen Hill used the phrase in the title of their local public radio show Music from the Hearts of Space. They developed an innovative segue music assembly technique, cross-mixing \"spacey\" instrumental pieces to create a sustained mood. The term began to be used more widely when the show was syndicated nationally in 1983. Other US-based radio programmers adopted the term as well, among them, John Diliberto, Steve Pross, and Gino Wong with Star's End, launched in 1976, Frank J. Forest (a.k.a. \"Forest\") with Musical Starstreams, launched in 1981 and nationally syndicated in 1983, and John Diliberto again with Echoes, launched in 1989.\n\nExamples of space music in film soundtracks include the Vangelis score to \"Blade Runner\",\n\nTangerine Dream's moody soundtracks for \"Legend\", \"Sorcerer\" and \"Risky Business\",\nJonn Serrie's surround-sound score for the IMAX short film, \"Hubble: Galaxies Across Space and Time\",\nTelevision science-fiction series \"Babylon 5\" was scored by former Tangerine Dream member Christopher Franke, released on CD in 1996 on Franke's independent label Sonic Images. The scores for many of the Babylon 5 TV movies and numerous Babylon 5 episodes were also released by Sonic Images. In 1994, the German TV station Bayerischer Rundfunk launched the television program Space Night, featuring a constant flow of satellite and space images accompanied by space music programmed by European chill-out-DJ Alex Azary.\n\n\n"}

It was founded in autumn 1942 by Colonel Dimitrios Psarros and politician Georgios Kartalis.\n\nAlongside Psarros and Kartalis, founding members included fellow officers Dimitrios Karachristos, Dimitrios Georgantas and others. The organization's aims were to fight the Germans as long as the occupation lasted and, after Liberation, work for a republican regime and social change.\n\nEKKA's armed wing was the 5/42 Evzone Regiment, founded in early 1943 and named after Psarros' old army unit. It numbered at its peak ca. 1,000 men, and was active mainly in Central Greece, in the area of Phocis. The organization however was from the outset confronted with the might of the communist-led Greek People's Liberation Army (ELAS), which claimed the overall leadership of the Resistance movement and regarded EKKA as reactionary and an anglophile organization. ELAS forces attacked the 5/42 Evzones Regiment on 14 May and 23 June 1943 forcing its dissolution, but bowing to pressure from the British Military Mission, they agreed to allow it to reform within the unifying framework of the so-called \"National Bands Agreement\" of July 1943. On 29 February 1944, near the bridge of Plaka, the was signed among the EKKA, EAM and EDES.\n\nNevertheless, the rivalry between ELAS and the republican EDES and EKKA groups continued, and on 14 April 1944, the EKKA forces were attacked by ELAS. The 5/42 Evzones Regiment held out for three days, but was then forced to retreat. A number of men managed to escape and cross the Corinthian Gulf to the Peloponnese. The majority however remained behind with Col. Psarros, were taken prisoner and later executed. It remains disputed if Psarros was killed during the battle or in captivity. The event caused a major shock in the Greek political scene since Psarros was a well-known republican, patriot and anti-royalist. The apparent determination of EAM-ELAS to monopolize the resistance movement caused concerns about its post-war intentions, leading to a more decisive opposition from the part of the other resistance groups and the pre-war political establishment. The event is considered a precursor of the Greek Civil War that broke out a year later (see Dekemvriana).\n\nFollowing the disbandment of the 5/42 Evzones Regiment, EKKA ceased to exist as a military and political factor, although Kartalis himself still participated as its representative, alongside the leaders of the other major Resistance and political groups, in the Lebanon Conference shortly after.\n\n1943\n1944\n\n"}

One such arrangement was a sole-source management agreement between the MEOI Science and Technology Division and the Innovation Institute of Ontario (IIO). The IIO is essentially a private corporation that was contracted to administer the $1.25 billion Ontario Research and Development Challenge Fund.\n\nThe Science and Technology Division of MEOI was the subject of a provincial audit in 2003. The Provincial Auditor was particularly critical and in the report said: \"A major concern was that the Ministry had committed to spending $4.3 billion without an overall strategic plan to set parameters and consistent policies for existing programs or to guide the development of new programs to meet the objectives of promoting innovation, economic growth, and job creation.\"\nAt that time the division had 50 staff, had spent $1.3 billion, and had committed a further $4.8 billion primarily on research grants to universities, colleges, and research hospitals.\n\nResearch funding is also a significant source of funding for higher education. The creation of this new ministry is closely aligned with the 2005 provincial budget, and the \"Reaching Higher\" initiative to provide $6.2 billion in funding for higher education in 2005-2010.\n\nFunding for research and innovation is also provided by the Canadian Government, and administered through Industry Canada. The Provincial-Federal relationship will be key to the success of the new Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation, and may present an opportunity for Premier McGuinty to further the \"Strong Ontario\" agenda which is attempting to close the $23 billion gap between the tax dollars collected in Ontario by the Federal Government, and the amount the Federal Government returned to the province through federal programs.\n\nThe Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation administered these programs:\n\n\n\n\n"}

This dune is the one that is most visible to visitors, many of whom delight in scrambling up its slopes and rushing back down again. Easy access to the dunes make it a popular location to practice the sport of sandboarding.\n\nThe dunes and beach area was preserved by a local businessman, Edward K. Warren, who originally purchased the site as a favor to a friend who had encountered significant financial difficulties. By 1930, the Warren Dunes area had been taken over as a state park.\n\n\nWarren Dunes is in the top five most popular camping destinations in the state of Michigan. The park contains two main campgrounds: Warren Dunes Modern and Warren Dunes Semi-Modern.

He currently competes full-time in the NASCAR Cup Series, driving the No. 11 Toyota Camry and part-time in the NASCAR Xfinity Series, driving a Toyota Supra, both for Joe Gibbs Racing. He has won over 30 NASCAR Cup Series races, including the Daytona 500 in 2016, 2019, and 2020. In 2020, he became the fourth person to win the race in back to back seasons, joining Richard Petty, Cale Yarborough, and Sterling Marlin. \n\nHamlin was born in Tampa, Florida, but lived in Chesterfield, Virginia, for most of his childhood. He began racing go-karts at the age of seven. Afterward, he worked his way up to Late Models by 2004 and signed a development contract with Joe Gibbs Racing. After running briefly in the Craftsman Truck Series, Hamlin drove a full season in the Busch Series in 2005, while running a few Nextel Cup races. After having strong race finishes, Hamlin was given a full-time ride with JGR.\n\nHis strongest season was in 2010, where he was leading the Championship by 15 points heading into the final race at Homestead. Despite having an incredible season, winning the most races of any driver in that year (8), he would lose the Championship by 39 points to Jimmie Johnson. With the exception of the 2013 season, in which a collision with Joey Logano damaged his lower back and kept him out for a large part of the early season, Hamlin has competed in the NASCAR Cup Series playoffs in every season he has competed full-time (12 seasons as of 2018), including his rookie season in 2006 when he finished third in the Chase for the NASCAR Nextel Cup standings, capping off one of the most impressive rookie campaigns in modern NASCAR history. \n\nSince his appearance in the Cup Series, Hamlin has been one of the most consistent drivers in the sport, winning at least one race from the 2006 to 2017 Cup seasons and again from 2019 to 2020. The 2019 season also saw him reach the playoffs' Championship Round with a six-win season, the most since 2010. These title near-misses have firmly established Hamlin as one of the best drivers in history to have never won a NASCAR Cup Championship.\n\nHamlin began his racing career in 1988, at the age of 7 years old, racing go-karts. By 1997 at 15, he won the WKA manufacturers cup. At the age of 16, he was racing mini stocks. In his first stock car race, at Langley Speedway, Hamlin won the pole position, and won the race. He then progressed to the Grand Stock division in 1998, and moved on to Late Model Stock Cars in 2000. In 2002, he won ten Late Model races, and surpassed that in 2003 with 25 wins, and 30 poles, out of 36 races. In 2004, while competing full-time in Late Model Stock Cars, Hamlin was signed to a driver development contract with Joe Gibbs Racing.\n\nIn 2004, Hamlin competed in five NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series races with EJP Racing, and had a tenth-place finish in his NASCAR debut at Indianapolis Raceway Park. He later ran his first career ARCA RE/MAX Series race at Talladega Superspeedway, finishing third in the No. 10 Pontiac owned by Andy Hillenburg. His final start of the year came at Darlington Raceway, when he made his Busch Series debut. He started twenty-seventh (rain-out) but finished eighth in the No. 18 Joe Gibbs Driven Performance Oil Chevrolet.\n\nHamlin ran the full season in 2005 after he replaced Mike Bliss in the No. 20 Rockwell Automation Chevrolet in the Busch Series. He ended up finishing 5th in the final championship points standings as a rookie in that series, with 11 top 10s and earnings of $1,064,110. Hamlin also ran his first NASCAR Cup Series races in 2005, making his Cup debut at Kansas Speedway as driver of the No. 11 FedEx Chevrolet for the 2006 season, after Jason Leffler was released, and made seven starts in the Cup series in 2005. He finished the Cup season with three top 10 finishes in those seven starts and one pole at Phoenix International Raceway. His performance in 2005 was impressive, a stark contrast to Leffler's embarrassingly poor performance during his tenure in the same car earlier in the season.\n\nIn 2006, Hamlin ran his first full season in the NASCAR Nextel Cup Series, and during the year he drove in both the Nextel Cup and Busch Series full-time. In Hamlin's first restrictor plate race as a Nextel Cup driver, he beat all the previous year's (2005 season) pole winners in the 70-lap 2006 Budweiser Shootout. Hamlin became the first Rookie of the Year candidate to take home the Shootout victory. Hamlin achieved his first career Busch Series victory at Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez (March 5). On June 11, 2006, Hamlin scored his first career Cup Series win at the Pocono 500, where he also won his second career pole. He achieved his second career win on July 23, 2006 in the Pennsylvania 500 also at Pocono Raceway becoming only the 2nd rookie in Nextel Cup history to sweep both races at a track during the same season (Jimmie Johnson did so at Dover International Speedway in his rookie season in 2002), both from the pole position. In the Cup Series, Hamlin won the Raybestos Rookie of the Year award and finished third in the final Cup standings, scoring the highest points finish for a rookie in the modern era of NASCAR, and the highest since James Hylton in 1966. Hamlin thus became the first ever rookie to make the Chase for the NEXTEL Cup, which he finished third in points.\n\nHamlin started the 2007 Cup season by finishing 28th in the Daytona 500. He won his third career Cup race at the Lenox Industrial Tools 300 at New Hampshire International Speedway. Following that race, Hamlin finished 43rd in the Pepsi 400 at Daytona International Speedway after being involved in a wreck early on in the event. This was the first ever 43rd-place finish in his career.\n\nHamlin clinched a spot in the Chase for the Cup and was seeded sixth, 50 points behind the leader, but finished 12th overall in the final standings. In the Nationwide Series, Hamlin scored three victories including Darlington, Michigan, and Dover in the No. 20 Rockwell Automation Chevy. He also finished 1st at Milwaukee, but Aric Almirola started the car and ran 60 laps before turning it over to Denny Hamlin. Almirola received the points, purse, and got credit for the win.\n\nIn 2008, Hamlin had a near identical season as before, but moved up to eighth in points, and won early in the season at Martinsville Speedway. He led 381 out of 410 laps in the 2008 Crown Royal Presents the Dan Lowry 400, the most dominant effort of a driver since 2000, but cut a tire and finished 24th. He won four races in the Nationwide Series, driving both the No. 18 and No. 20 entries for Gibbs, as well as the No. 32 Dollar General/Hass avocados car for Braun Racing.\n\nHe continued driving the No. 11 car in Sprint Cup in 2009, as well as sharing the No. 20 car for Joe Gibbs Racing in the Nationwide Series. Hamlin won his fifth Cup career race at Pocono Raceway on August 3, 2009. Hamlin boldly stated at the final restart \"I'm going to win this race.\" He followed through on the statement, moving from sixth to first and snapping a 50 race win-less streak. The win was Hamlin's third at Pocono. It was especially emotional for the No. 11 team as Hamlin had lost his grandmother, Thelma Clark, that Friday.\n\nHamlin once again dominated the race at Richmond International Raceway and finally won at his home track. On October 25, 2009, Hamlin held off Jimmie Johnson to win the TUMS Fast Relief 500 at Martinsville Speedway. He went on to win the Ford 400 at the 2009 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway, capping off his 2009 season 5th in the overall standings with 4 wins, 15 top 5s and 20 top 10s. Hamlin took the lead after starting the race in 38th position and he led a total of 70 laps to capture his 4th win of the 2009 season.\n\nHamlin entered the 2010 season with great expectations. Many believed he would be a favorite to unseat Jimmie Johnson as Sprint Cup Champion. On January 22, 2010, Hamlin tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee while playing basketball. The decision was made to postpone his surgery until after the season. Hamlin announced on March 27, 2010, to have surgery on his left knee the following Monday. The decision was made to prevent further damage to his knee.\n\nOn March 29, 2010, Hamlin won the rain-postponed race at Martinsville Speedway in wild fashion. He beat his Joe Gibbs Racing teammate, Joey Logano, and Jeff Gordon to the finish line. Two days later, Hamlin had knee surgery to repair the torn ligament in his left knee.\n\nOn April 19, 2010, three weeks after his surgery, Hamlin worked his way from a 28th starting spot to restart 2nd with 13 laps to go at Texas Motor Speedway. Hamlin was later able to pass Jeff Burton on the outside and hold off Jimmie Johnson to get his 10th career win and his second win in three races.\n\nLess than three weeks later on May 8, Hamlin visited victory lane for the third time in 2010 at Darlington Raceway. He swept the weekend by winning both the Sprint Cup and Nationwide series events. He became the first driver to do so at Darlington since Mark Martin in 1993. He won the Nationwide Series Royal Purple 200 presented by O'Reilly Auto Parts driving the No. 20 for Joe Gibbs Racing on Friday night. He started on the pole and led the most laps to win the race.\n\nHamlin started 8th in Saturday night's Showtime Southern 500 and went on to lead 108 laps and take the checkered flag. A few races later, Hamlin dominated at The Gillette Fusion ProGlide 500 Presented By Target at Pocono Raceway, leading the most laps on his way to gathering his 12th career win, his 4th win of the season, and his fourth win at Pocono. A week later, Hamlin set a career-high fifth win of the season, when he won at Michigan International Speedway after starting 7th.\n\nLater in the 2010 season, Hamlin finished 43rd in the Emory Healthcare 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway. This dropped him five spots in the Chase standings, placing him in 10th overall. Despite the drop in the standings, the top 10 drivers in the Chase were locked in after Atlanta, guaranteeing Hamlin a spot in the 2010 Chase for the Sprint Cup.\nA driver error in the first Chase race on part of Carl Edwards caused Hamlin to spin with 85 to go. With cars ahead running out of fuel, Hamlin barely lost to Clint Bowyer.\n\nIn the AAA 400 at Dover International Speedway Hamlin finished the race in 9th and retained the points lead by 35 points over Jimmie Johnson.\nThe following week at Kansas Speedway, Hamlin encountered a rough driving car and finished 12th, a finish that was not good enough to keep the points lead, and fell into a deficit of 8 points to Jimmie Johnson, who finished 2nd. Then the following week at California he finished in the top 10 but still lost points to the 48 car of Jimmie Johnson.\n\nAt Charlotte Motor Speedway, Hamlin led a lap (his first lead in the Chase) and finished in 4th, one spot behind points leader Jimmie Johnson, and lost another 5 points. But the triumph came at the 0.526-mile (paper clip-shaped) Martinsville Speedway; Hamlin came through with his series-leading seventh victory of the season. Hamlin won the pole and led the first 11 laps but encountered tire issues; he dropped back to 17th and finally worked himself up consistently to 5th until lap 471 with 29 laps to go, he took the lead from Kevin Harvick and held off a hard-charging Mark Martin to lead the final 29 laps and take his 3rd straight victory at Martinsville and his 4th at the historic track. He closed the lead to 6 points behind points leader and 5th-place finisher, Jimmie Johnson.\n\nNext up was the Amp Energy Juice 500 at the Talladega Superspeedway. Hamlin started 17th, but fell back and lost the draft. He went a lap down, but when a caution came out, he got the Lucky Dog and was back on the lead lap. He then worked his way up to a 9th-place finish, two spots behind points leader Jimmie Johnson. This put Hamlin another 8 points behind in the standings, totaling to 14. Hamlin won the AAA Texas 500 at Texas Motor Speedway, and then led the standings by 33 over Johnson with two races to go. Next was Phoenix International speedway. Hamlin started 14th but got up to the front right away and was leading for almost the whole race. With 14 laps to go, Hamlin had to pit because he was short on fuel. He finished 12th. After the race, Hamlin was furious and threw a water bottle in frustration. With one race to go, Hamlin led Johnson by 15 points and was 46 points ahead of Kevin Harvick. On the last race he lost the lead to Johnson and ended up 39 points behind him.\n\nIn 2011 Hamlin almost won the Budweiser Shootout, but the victory was taken away from him by Kurt Busch because at the last second, Hamlin crossed the yellow line, on turn four to the finish line, in his attempt to pass Ryan Newman.\n\nDenny struggled in the first 8 races where his only top 10 was a seventh at Las Vegas. However, when the series got to Richmond, Denny turned on the heat by winning both his charity event and the Nationwide race but would finish 2nd to teammate Kyle Busch. He would go on to finish outside of the top 10 once at dover finishing in the top 20 and rebounded with finishes of 10th and 3rd at Charlotte and Kansas respectively.\n\nAfter his 3rd-place finish at Kansas, he would climb to 11th in points – 1 point out of the coveted 10th as the series goes to his favorite track, Pocono, where he would have tied himself for the most all-time wins at the track, if he had placed first. After a disappointing 19th-place finish, he moved on to Michigan, a track at which he posted a 1st and 2nd-place finish in 2010. Before the first practice at Michigan, oil pans unapproved by NASCAR were confiscated from the three JGR teams, including Hamlin.\n\nAfter showing signs of sheer mediocrity during each practice and qualifying, Hamlin qualified 10th in the field. He showed signs of improvement at the very start of the race, Hamlin quickly slid back in the field and was in the 10th to 15th place range until beginning to improve with about 70 laps to go, deeming the adjustment on his loose race car \"a magic adjustment\" On lap 158, with 42 laps to go, a penalty caused by an accident between Juan Pablo Montoya and Andy Lally allowed Hamlin to move to the front of the field by short pitting. Another caution on lap 192 moved the 11 car up to the first position. After a restart, Hamlin surged to ahead of the group, with Matt Kenseth right behind him in the closing three laps. After desperately trying to move past Hamlin, Kenseth made a final attempt coming out of turn four on the final lap, causing him to almost hit the wall because of a loose racecar. This win vaulted Hamlin from 12th in the standings, where he would have been replaced in the chase by Jeff Gordon if each stayed in their current position, to 9th, where he is guaranteed a spot in the chase. At the end of the season Joe Gibbs Racing announced that Mike Ford would not return as Hamlin's crew chief in 2012.\n\nJoe Gibbs Racing announced that Darian Grubb will be Mike Ford's replacement as Hamlin's crew chief for the 2012 season. Grubb previously served as crew chief for Tony Stewart, where he helped Stewart to his third Sprint Cup title in 2011.\n\nHamlin scored his first win of the year in the second event on the schedule, at Phoenix International Raceway. On April 22, 2012, Hamlin out-dueled Martin Truex Jr. to score his second win in the eighth race of the year, at Kansas Speedway. At the Crown Royal Curtiss Shaver 400 at the Brickyard, Hamlin scored his eleventh pole. He won his third race of the year at Bristol Motor Speedway on August 26 in the Irwin Tools Night Race. A week later, he became the first driver of the year to have back-to-back wins, winning the AdvoCare 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway, again out-dueling Truex. Two weeks later, he dominated and won the Sylvania 300 at New Hampshire Motor Speedway after starting 32nd, deep in the field. This was Joe Gibbs Racing's 100th win in the NASCAR Sprint Cup series.\n\nHamlin started the season on a low note, crashing his cars in both the Sprint Unlimited and the Budweiser Duel. The crash in the Duel put him into a backup car for the Daytona 500. Hamlin started 35th, led 33 laps, and finished 14th. He improved the following week, with a third-place finish at Phoenix, then a 15th-place finish at Las Vegas. He led the most laps at Bristol, but ran out of gas. Controversy unfolded after Hamlin spun his ex-teammate Joey Logano battling for position. This resulted in Hamlin and Logano exchanging words in the garage after the race.\n\nAt Fontana, Hamlin won his first pole for 2013. On the final restart Hamlin restarted in 12th place and with 12 laps left Hamlin reached third place before passing Kyle Busch and Kurt Busch for the top 2 spots with Joey Logano. His rivalry with Logano continued as the two fought side-by-side for the win in the last two laps. Heading into turn 3 on the white flag lap, Hamlin edged in front at the entry, but Logano drifted up the track into Hamlin. In his attempt to correct the car, Hamlin tagged Logano, sending the latter up into the outside wall, while Hamlin came off the banking and smashed head-on into an inside retaining wall. Hamlin's teammate Kyle Busch passed them to win the race.\n\nAlthough Hamlin climbed out of the car right after the crash, he immediately collapsed and lay on the track. He was airlifted to the hospital as a precaution. When lying in the hospital Hamlin interpreted Logano's post race words about their battle as Logano saying that he held a grudge against Hamlin and retaliated against Hamlin. It was announced the next day that Hamlin had suffered a massive L1 compression fracture, or a collapsed vertebra. Dr. Petty, Hamlin's JGR doctor reported on Tuesday that Hamlin's back would heal in six weeks and Hamlin would need time off. Two of Michael Waltrip Racing's Part-time drivers stepped in to replace Hamlin, with Mark Martin filling in at Martinsville and Brian Vickers filling in for four races. He made his return at Talladega in the Aaron's 499, and told reporters that since he was not ready to run a full race, he would switch with Brian Vickers during the first caution and pit stop by a special exit on the roof attached to the car.\n\nLike planned, during a caution, Hamlin switched out with Vickers on lap 23. Under NASCAR rules, since Hamlin started the race, he would receive credit for any results. Vickers got caught up in a 14 car wreck on lap 43, relegating the car to a 34th-place finish.\n\nAt Darlington, Hamlin drove his first full race since his injury. He qualified sixth. In the waning laps, he held off Jeff Gordon to finish second to teammate Matt Kenseth.\n\nAt Charlotte, for the Coca-Cola 600, Hamlin clinched a pole position with a record speed of , breaking the previous speed of set by Greg Biffle. During the race, Hamlin led six laps and finished in the fourth position.\n\nAt Dover, Hamlin started on the pole for the second week in a row. He led 41 laps before he cut a tire on lap 378 and hit the wall, causing him to finish 34th.\n\nAt Pocono Hamlin started in 17th and finished in 8th place. He had shown some recovery.\n\nAt Michigan, Sonoma and Kentucky, Hamlin did not fare well. Finishing in 30th, 23rd and 35th place. He only got up to 25th in the points standings and 150 points behind 20th place. Without any wins, his chances of making a Wildcard bid for the Chase were nixed.\n\nAt Daytona, Hamlin started 24th and led 20 laps, before he got into a wreck off of turn 4 with Juan Pablo Montoya and Martin Truex Jr.. Hamlin stayed on the track, a lap down, and got the free pass with the next caution. However, on lap 148, Hamlin hit the tri-oval wall head on and then his car was struck by A. J. Allmendinger and went airborne.\n\nHe wrecked at Pocono on Lap 15 after losing control of his car in the third turn and solidified his chances of missing the Chase for the first time in his career (He ran 7 races in 2005 but his first appearance was at a Chase race). At Michigan, he was officially eliminated from the Chase even if he won the next four races because he was too far back in the points.\n\nAt Richmond Denny Hamlin got an apology from Joey Logano for their Auto Club incident with Logano after months of denial admitting it was on purpose but Hamlin did not buy the apology, thinking that Logano was just doing it to ask Hamlin to not interfere with his own title hopes. Despite this Hamlin and Logano said they settled their differences by December.\n\nThough Hamlin struggled to a 23rd-place points finish, the season was not entirely unkind to him, as he won the season finale at Homestead after a fierce battle with Matt Kenseth and Dale Earnhardt, Jr. over the last 30 laps.\n\nHamlin started the 2014 season strong by winning the pole and leading all three segments of the Sprint Unlimited, eventually winning the race. Hamlin then went on to win the second of the Budweiser Duels. In the Daytona 500, Hamlin started third and led for 16 laps, and was the fan favorite to win the race and sweep all three Sprint Cup events in Speedweeks, but was unable to overtake Dale Earnhardt, Jr. in the last two laps and ended up finishing second.\n\nAt Auto Club, Hamlin came down with a sinus infection that affected his vision just hours before the race began. A half-hour before the green flag, Joe Gibbs Racing managed to place Sam Hornish, Jr. to take over Hamlin's car for the race. Hornish drove the car to a 17th-place finish. The infection was announced a few days later as a piece of metal that had been lodged in Hamlin's eye. At Talladega, Hamlin won the race as the caution flag waved during the last lap.\n\nAt the Brickyard 400, Hamlin finished 3rd. However his 11 car failed post-race inspection. NASCAR impounded the 11 car and investigated various pieces on it. 2 days later NASCAR suspended crew chief Darian Grubb for six races, fined Grubb $125,000, docked Hamlin 75 driver points and Joe Gibbs 75 owner points, suspended 11 car chief Wesley Sherrill and put the 11 team members on probation until December 31, 2014. Initially Joe Gibbs and the team decided to appeal the penalties but they changed their minds. On the penalty Denny said \"We'll just simply move forward and not let this affect our performances.\" Despite the penalties handed to Hamlin's crew, Denny Hamlin is locked into in the 2014 Chase due to his win at Talladega Superspeedway.\n\nHamlin's spot in the 2014 Chase was sealed up after the 2014 Michigan race with his Talladega win. At Bristol, Hamlin appeared to have a perfect car to win but after leading many laps Hamlin wrecked after contact from Kevin Harvick while racing for the lead. Hamlin replied by angrily throwing his HANS device at Harvick's car during a caution period. Some fans wondered if NASCAR should have penalized Hamlin for exiting his car before the safety workers came out (a rule made by NASCAR in the wake of the big tragedy in which Tony Stewart's car ran over and killed Sprint-Car driver Kevin Ward Jr.) but NASCAR did not penalize Hamlin, stating that safety workers first had told Hamlin to get out of the car by radio & then gave Hamlin permission to toss his HANS device at Harvick's car. Harvick later apologized for causing the crash via Twitter while Hamlin said his acceptance of Harvick's apology would only depend on how clean Harvick would compete with him in the future. Despite he and his team's shortcomings throughout the regular season, Hamlin managed to put together a consistent Chase. His results earned him a spot within the final four title contenders heading to the final round, and he was leading the race and the title with twenty laps to go, but a caution came out and Darian Grubb, his crew chief, decided to opt out of stopping for fresh tires and fuel, which would turn out to be a costly decision. He finished 7th in the race, and 3rd in the championship.\n\nHamlin started the season by having to go to the rear in the Budweiser Duels after being penalized during Daytona 500 qualifying.\n\nIn the Daytona 500 he came very close for the second year in a row to winning the race. He finished 4th and had one of the best cars of Speedweeks. However, at Atlanta, Hamlin finished 38th after being involved in a wreck with 42 laps to go. In Las Vegas, he rebounded from his wreck the previous week and finished 5th. However, at Phoenix, Hamlin did not run well all day leading to a 24th-place finish.\n\nAt California, Hamlin had one of the best cars of the race, leading 56 laps, second to Kurt Busch's 61 laps. A bad pit stop and bad ensuing restart pushed Hamlin down to 13th, but he rebounded to 3rd place with 20 laps to go. Hamlin's chances of winning the race ended when he and his crew were penalized for an uncontrolled tire on their pit stop with 20 laps to go making him go to the tail end of the longest line. He restarted 29th and finished the race 28th.\n\nAt Martinsville Speedway, Hamlin stayed up in the top ten nearly all race long. Late in the race he got penalized for an uncontrolled tire, sending him to the tail end of the field in 31st place. Despite this he formed a tremendous comeback, coming back into the top ten 50 laps later. After a good restart with less than 30 laps to go, Denny Hamlin sealed up his victory, but not before holding off a challenge by rival Brad Keselowski. Hamlin edged Keselowski at the stripe by 0.3 seconds (1 car-length), for his 5th Martinsville victory, leading 91 laps in total. Hamlin, who had feuded with Keselowski during the 2014 Bank of America 500, commended Keselowski for not wrecking him to win the race.\n\nAt the spring Bristol race, Hamlin was replaced by Erik Jones after 22 laps due to suffering from neck spasms.\n\nIn May, Hamlin won the Sprint All-Star Race after beating Keselowski off pit road during final pit stops. This was not only Hamlin's first All-Star win, but also the first JGR and Toyota All-Star wins.\n\nAfter qualifying for the Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup, Hamlin won the first race of the Chase at Chicagoland Speedway, which locked him in for the second round of the Chase.\n\nAt Talladega in the next round, at the end of the race his car crashed and caught fire because of being caught up in \"The Big One\", which eliminated him from the Chase for not having enough points to advance.\n\nWith new crew chief Mike Wheeler replacing Dave Rogers, Hamlin won the Sprint Unlimited. In the Daytona 500, Hamlin made a pass on Joe Gibbs Racing teammate Matt Kenseth for the lead on the final lap. Hamlin and Martin Truex Jr. were side-by-side for the win as they crossed the start-finish line, but Hamlin – who led a race-high 95 laps – prevailed by 0.011 seconds over Truex, making it the closest Daytona 500 finish in history, and bringing owner Joe Gibbs his first Daytona 500 victory since 1993. After his huge Daytona 500 win he struggled a bit, the next week at Atlanta he was not as strong, finishing 16th. The next week at Las Vegas he would finish outside of the top 10 again finishing 19th. The next week at Phoenix he would rebound with a strong 3rd-place finish. The next week at Auto Club he would have another strong 3rd-place finish. The next week at Martinsville he was running well till he wrecked after jumping the curb and slamming into the wall and he would finish 39th. The next week at Texas he would finish 12th. The next week at Bristol he would wreck again finishing 20th. The next week at Richmond he would get a solid top 10 finish finishing 6th. The next week at Talladega he would be involved in a wreck yet again finishing 31st. The next week at Kansas he would be involved in back to back wrecks finishing 37th. The next week at Dover was involved in a wreck 3 weeks in a row after there was a botched restart when Jimmie Johnson missed a shift, but would bounce back to finish 7th. At the next weekend in Charlotte, Hamlin ran double duty, driving car number 18 to the win, the 15th Xfinity Series race of his career in his first Xfinity start of the season. In the Cup race, he would run great all race long and would finish with a solid 4th-place finish, while his Toyota teammate Martin Truex Jr. would dominate the race and win. The next week at Pocono he would finish get a solid top 15 finishing 14th. The next week at Michigan, he cut his left-rear tire at the start-finish line, resulting in a disappointing 33rd. The next week at Sonoma, Hamlin would lead the most laps but Tony Stewart would get the lead later after staying out and on the final lap Hamlin would pass Stewart but in the final corner Hamlin would wheel hop and hit the wall giving Stewart back the lead and Stewart would go on to win and get his first win since 2013. The next week coming back to Daytona, Hamlin would finish 17th. The next week at Kentucky, it would come down to fuel and Hamlin would finish 15th. The next week at New Hampshire, he would finish 9th. The next week at Indy, he would finish 4th. The next week at Pocono, he would finish 7th. The next week at Watkins Glen, Hamlin would run well and get the lead later in the race and after a couple of red flags, he would go on to win getting his 2nd win of the season since the Daytona 500. The next week at Bristol he would finish 3rd after a couple of big wrecks at the end. The next week at Michigan, he would finish 9th. Hamlin would pick up his third win of the season at Richmond in September.\n\nHamlin had a difficult start to the 2017 season, in which there were many changes to how the races are run (the biggest change being the all-new stage racing). Hamlin picked up an 8th-place finish in Stage 1 of the Daytona 500 but got caught up in one of several 'Big Ones' at the end of Stage 2, caused by a tire blowout on the No. 18 Toyota Camry of Kyle Busch, and would finish the race in 17th. A dismal race in Atlanta followed, with Hamlin retiring from mechanical failures, and he was classified 38th. However, he bounced back in Las Vegas with a sixth-place finish, and followed this up with another top-10 result in Phoenix. In the STP 500 at Martinsville, a track on which Hamlin is a 5-time winner, he claimed 2nd place in Stage 1, before suffering from firstly a bad pit strategy and then a collision with Danica Patrick, finishing 30th in the race.\n\nHamlin's Toyota began to improve dramatically after a mediocre Texas race and, through combining the new-found speed of his JGR car and his limitless talent on short tracks, earned two 8th-place finishes in stages 1 and 2 at Bristol and led a dozen or so laps of the race late on, but was passed by Jimmie Johnson in the final stage and subsequently fell back to finish 10th. He also led 50 laps at his home track at Richmond (also a short track), superbly jumping Brad Keselowski from 2nd place at the 6th restart, and would earn a 3rd-place finish in the race, along with stage points from both stages.\n\nHamlin's unique skills on restrictor-plate tracks shone through at Talladega Superspeedway the following week. He used pit strategy to take his first stage win of the year in stage 2, and also led more laps than any other driver, but this was not enough to get his first win, as he fell back late in the race. He took his second stage win of the year in Stage 3 of the Coca-Cola 600 in Charlotte and led the last 10 laps of that stage. However, Hamlin restarted poorly from the front and fell back to 10th on the first lap of the final stage. He would recover and work his way through the field, finishing 5th and earning valuable points in the standings.\nHamlin earned a respectable 8th-place finish at a wreck-filled Dover despite getting busted for an uncontrolled tire in Stage 1, and subsequently ran well at Pocono, finishing 12th after falling back late. At Michigan, Hamlin finished 4th after a tense battle with Kyle Larson on the final restart. He then returned to the road course at Sonoma, the scene of his duel with Tony Stewart in 2016 where he was passed on the last corner of the last lap. He led 12 laps during Stage 2 and remained in the top 2 throughout most of the race but he lost grip in his tires towards the end, losing 2nd to Clint Bowyer with 6 laps to go and then 3rd to Brad Keselowski on the final lap, just before the caution waved to end the race after Kasey Kahne crashed on the front straight. He finished 4th, adding to his 5th and 4th places in the two stages earlier in the race.\n\nAt Daytona the following week, Hamlin had a very quick car, leading 16 laps during Stage 2 and finishing a very close 2nd to teammate Matt Kenseth in that stage. However, Hamlin's Coke Zero 400 race on the 4th of July weekend ended in frustration as he suffered only his second retirement of the year. Hamlin got caught up in a 3-car incident with 3 laps to go, while running 7th. He tried to get moving again before the car erupted into flames, ending his evening.\n\nThe next race in Kentucky brought another consistent top-5 weekend, finishing 4th and 5th in the stages and 4th overall, but it was the following week that Hamlin finally broke through. He came from 8th on the grid - finishing every stage in the top 10 (9th and 2nd) to then lead 52 laps on his way to victory in New Hampshire. This win marked Hamlin's 30th NASCAR Cup Series win, his 3rd career Cup victory at Loudon and JGR's first win of 2017.\n\nA dismal Indianapolis race followed, with a 17th-place finish after a blown tire in overtime cost him a top-5 result. However, Hamlin got back into the top 5 yet again this season at the Overton's 400 in Pocono. The race became all about 4 drivers, as he battled with Kyle Busch, Martin Truex Jr. and Kevin Harvick throughout. Hamlin would end up finishing 4th after leading 18 laps and looking like a real contender to win his second race of the season. Busch went to victory lane, ensuring everyone that JGR were back up to their regular speed. Hamlin continued adding to his impressive amount of top-5 finishes for 2017 the following week, finishing 4th at Watkins Glen, the scene of his first road course victory of his career the year before.\n\nHeading into the next race at Michigan, Hamlin's long-time partner Jordan Fish had reached the end of her pregnancy, and their baby was due at any point. Due to this, NASCAR Camping World Truck Series driver Christopher Bell ran laps in Hamlin's No. 11 Toyota in practice as preparation to step into the car, in the event that Hamlin's girlfriend would go into labor during the weekend. She did not, however, as Hamlin finished the race in 16th due to a bold strategy by the team to stay out on old tires until a caution flew, which did not happen as planned; he pitted just 11 laps from the end, and the caution he needed flew 2 laps later.\n\nHamlin earned himself a 3rd-place finish at the Night Race at Bristol after a very consistent run. The following week, at Darlington, Hamlin dominated both the Xfinity and Cup races. He outdueled Joey Logano in the Xfinity race on Saturday, using the crossover move on the last corner to cut underneath him and win. In the Cup race, Hamlin's 'Flying 11' was the most consistent and fastest car on track. After leading 124 laps out of the 367 lap event, he drove on to victory and would get his 2nd win of the season despite a pit road mistake late in the race. However, his car would fail post-race inspection in both races after NASCAR discovered an illegal rear suspension element. Hamlin's wins would be ruled \"encumbered\" and he was docked 25 points as a result. His crew chief Mike Wheeler was fined $50,000 and suspended for 2 races. The Cup Series event would also mark Hamlin's most recent victory up until the 2019 Daytona 500, 47 Cup races later.\n\nThe final race of the regular season at Richmond provided yet another top 5 for the No. 11 car, but it could have been better. Kyle Larson won the race after besting Martin Truex Jr. in overtime, but on the final lap Hamlin attempted to pass Truex for 2nd and slid his tyres, collecting Truex and putting him into the outside wall. Hamlin recovered to finish 5th and later apologized to the 2017 regular season champion.\n\nThe playoffs began very well for Hamlin as he added another top 5 to his amazingly consistent run of late, finishing 4th. This meant that his average finish of 6th over the last 10 races was the best in the field, and put him in an excellent spot going into the 2nd playoff race at New Hampshire, a race that Hamlin won in the summer and has won 3 times overall in his career. Despite his summer win at Loudon, he would finish 12th this time after a pretty average race. At Dover, Hamlin was able to collect stage points to clinch a spot for the Round of 12, but retired from the race with less than 30 to go due to a broken axle.\n\nThe Round of 12 began very positively for Hamlin, as he clinched the pole for the Bank of America 500 at Charlotte race, his first pole of the season. He ran up front the entire race, earning useful stage points and eventually a 4th-place finish, which placed him 5th in the standings, 13 points above the cutoff line going into Talladega.\n\nHamlin started the round of 8 in a controversial Martinsville race, where at 3 laps to go, he bumped Chase Elliott on one of the turns, causing Elliott to spin out. Many fans believed that the wreck was done intentional, as they booed loudly at Hamlin during his post-race interview. “I got into the back of him and he spun out,” Hamlin told NBCSN. “Trying to get a race win... Everybody was doing the exact same thing. I hate it for his team. I understand they've had a win for a long time coming, but this is for a ticket to Homestead. ” At Phoenix, on what it looked like Hamlin was going to get in the Championship 4 after grabbing 19 stage points and a stage win, his chances backfired as he slammed the wall with under 45 laps to go after contact from Chase Elliott, and did not make it to the final round as a result.\n\nHamlin started the 2018 season with a third-place finish at the 2018 Daytona 500. Despite being winless throughout the regular season, he made the playoffs by staying consistent with seven top-fives and 14 top-10s. Hamlin was eliminated in the Round of 16 after finishing out of the top-10 at Las Vegas, Richmond, and the Charlotte Roval. He wound up 11th in the final point standings, his first time outside the top ten since the year he missed four races due to injury (2013) and winless for the first time in his career, snapping a 12-season streak of winning at least one race dating back to his first full-time rookie year (2006) when he swept both Pocono races to when he won the July New Hampshire race along with his second Southern 500 (2017). Hamlin's long time rival, Jimmie Johnson, also did not secure a win in the 2018 season.\n\nHamlin started the 2019 season by breaking a 47-race winless streak with his second Daytona 500 win, first Cup Series win for new crew chief Chris Gabehart, along with dedicating the victory to the late J. D. Gibbs. He scored his second win of the season at Texas. At the spring Dover race, Hamlin was rushed to the infield care center for carbon monoxide poisoning after an accident knocked out his car's right rear crush panel and allowed fumes inside the cabin. Despite this setback, he stayed consistent throughout the season, scoring two more wins at Pocono and the Bristol Night Race. Despite a 19th-place finish at the Charlotte Roval, Hamlin collected enough points to advance to the Round of 12. At Martinsville, Hamlin collided with Logano on turn four, squeezing Logano into the outside wall and causing him to lose a tire and spin out two laps later. Hamlin finished fourth while Logano salvaged an eighth-place finish. After the race, Hamlin and Logano had a discussion on the incident before Logano slapped Hamlin's right shoulder, sparking a fight between the two. NASCAR suspended Dave Nichols Jr., the No. 22 team's tire technician, for one race for pulling Hamlin down to the ground during the altercation.\n\nOn November 1, Hamlin revealed that he has a torn labrum in his left shoulder and would have it surgically repaired after the 2019 season. Despite this, Hamlin went on a tear during the Playoffs, scoring his fifth victory of the season at Kansas only two weeks prior and ultimately advancing to the Championship 4 for the first time since 2014 with his sixth victory of the year at Phoenix, his second victory at the track since 2012 and second time in his career that he had won at least six times in a season (having won eight races in 2010). At Homestead however, Hamlin was a non-factor for the victory and Championship despite starting from the pole as he led only 2 laps, made an unscheduled pit stop to fix overheating issues after gambling with extra nose tape, and only recovered from a lap down to finish the race in 10th-place. He finished the season fourth in points in his first season with Gabehart as crew chief, a 7-spot improvement over the previous season along with six victories after being winless the year prior. \n\nAt the Xfinity level, Hamlin also won the Darlington race, but was disqualified after his car failed to meet height requirements during post-race inspection. As a result, second-place finisher Cole Custer was declared the official race winner.\n\nHamlin won his third Daytona 500 in 2020 when he beat Ryan Blaney to the finish in overtime by 0.014 seconds, the second-closest finish in the race's history behind Hamlin's 2016 win. The victory was overshadowed by Ryan Newman's wreck coming to the finish that resulted in hospitalization, sparking controversy over Hamlin's post-race burnouts while Newman's health was unknown; Hamlin and Joe Gibbs apologized for the celebrations, the former explaining he had not learned of Newman's status until he was in Victory Lane.\n\nHamlin is the only son of Dennis Hamlin and Mary Lou Clark. Hamlin and Jordan Fish have two daughters together. Taylor James Hamlin was born on January 20, 2013. Just before the start of the 2017 season at the Daytona 500, it was announced that the couple were expecting their second child. Molly Gold Hamlin was born on August 15, 2017.\n\nIn 2016, Hamlin was a \"Fox NASCAR\" guest analyst for the Xfinity Series race at Talladega. A year later, he returned to Fox for the Cup drivers-only broadcast of the Xfinity race at Pocono, working in the Hollywood Hotel studio alongside Danica Patrick.\n\nHamlin, along with his Toyota teammates, recorded video clips on how to drive a lap at all of the NASCAR tracks on the 2016 circuit in the video game \"NASCAR Heat Evolution\". He is also featured as one of eight playable drivers on the \"EA Sports NASCAR Racing\" arcade game, the only rookie to be featured in the game.\n\n Season still in progress<br>\n\n"}

He served as 7th Chief Minister of Bihar in the year 1968,but he had resigned after 30 days. He was also a parliamentarian who served as the chairman of the Second Backward Classes Commission (popularly known as the Mandal Commission). B.P. Mandal came from Yadav Community. from Madhepura in Northern Bihar. The commission's report mobilised a segment of the Indian population known as \"Other Backward Classes\" (OBCs) and initiated a fierce debate on the policy for underrepresented and underprivileged groups in Indian politics.\n\nB. P. Mandal came from the Hindu Yadav community in Bihar. He was born in a family of landlords. He authored the obc commission which is also known as Mandal Commission.\n\nMandaldal was a Member of Parliament for Madhepura from the state of Bihar from 1967 to 1970 and from 1977 to 1979.\n\nHe was the Chief Minister of Bihar, governing for 30 days in 1968, a period of intense political instability (his predecessor Satish Prasad Singh was the first Chief Minister from OBC but only for three days)\n\nIn December 1978, Prime Minister Morarji Desai appointed a five-member civil rights commission under the chairmanship of Mandal. The commission's report was completed in 1980 and recommended that a significant proportion of all government and educational places be reserved for applicants from the Other Backward Classes as these were the socially-deprived communities historically that had been treated as outcasts and denied job opportunities as well as proper education in the public institutions that were upper-caste dominant at the time.\n\nThe commission's report was tabled indefinitely by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. A decade later, Prime Minister V. P. Singh implemented the recommendations of the Mandal Report and led to what is now known as the caste-reservation system in India. \n\nThe Mandal commission was not well-received by a number of upper-caste communities leading to nation-wide protests and uproar especially by the students of Upper-castes who saw their educational opportunities under threat while many of the people from these communities still continue to consider the policies to be unnecessary and biased.\n\nThe Government of India issued a stamp in honour of B. P. Mandal in 2001. A college named in his honour, B. P. Mandal Engineering College, was founded in 2007.\n\nVarious statues and memorials were made in his memory in the state and one of the most glorious one stands in front of the governor's House in Patna. Every year his birth anniversary is celebrated in a formal ceremonial manner by his son Manindra Kumar Mandal and his other family members in their village and the Chief Minister and other cabinet members of the state in Patna, Sasaram and at various other spots. \n\n"}

Masiello (born April 28, 1947) is an American politician and former basketball player who served as Mayor of Buffalo, New York from 1994 to 2005. Prior to being mayor, he served as a member of the New York State Senate.\n\nA Buffalo native, Masiello is the oldest of seven children born to Bridget and Dan Masiello. Masiello graduated from Canisius College in 1969, where he played as a member of the Canisius Golden Griffins men's basketball team. He was then drafted by the Indiana Pacers in the 1969 NBA draft, and played on the team during the 1969–1970 season.\n\nIn 1971, Masiello began his career politics when he was elected as a district representative to the Buffalo Common Council. He was subsequently elected to an at-large seat on the Council and served as Democratic Majority leader in 1976. He also served as Chairman of the Council Finance Committee.\n\nMasiello was a member of the New York State Senate from 1981 to 1993, sitting in the 184th, 185th, 186th, 187th, 188th, 189th and 190th New York State Legislatures. Masiello's Senate district originally comprised mainly Buffalo and other parts of Erie County, New York. During the final year of his Senate service, his district encompassed part of Buffalo, as well as Grand Island, Niagara Falls and Tonawanda. In the State Senate, Masiello ascended to Minority Whip and served as Chair of the Democratic Conference. As a senator, Masiello served as the Ranking Minority Member of various committees, including the Child Care Committee and the Energy Committee.\n\nMasiello was sworn in as the 61st Mayor Buffalo on January 1, 1994. Masiello received 65% of the Democratic Primary vote and 67% of the General Election vote in 1993. He was re-elected to second term in 1997 and again to a third term in 2001 with the joint endorsement of the Democratic and Republican parties.\n\nAs mayor, he focused on economic development, governmental restructuring, and education. He cut over 1,000 jobs from the city payroll by restructuring management and the police department. He successfully sought approval from the state to create a joint construction fund for the city schools, which has been used to renovate and build city schools. He unsuccessfully sought to take control of the Buffalo Board of Education and install his own appointees. This is unlike Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City who won this authority.\n\nIn 1997, Masiello's office, and under the direction of Buffalo State College's Center for Applied Research in Interactive Technologies, launched CityNet, an advanced telecommunications network that links 14 educational and community sites in Buffalo.\n\nIn 2005, he announced that he would not run for re-election. He was succeeded by Byron Brown on December 31, 2005. Following his service as mayor, Masiello joined a political consulting and lobbying firm located in Buffalo.\n\nOn April 19, 2014 he was accused by Kevin P. Connor of lobbying Peace Bridge reconstruction. During the same time he also lobbied Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority but said that he doesn't have anything against stationary engineers being Fair Apportionment of Infrastructure Resources members and that he will not participate at the Buffalo and Fort Erie Public Bridge Authority votes.\n\nHe is married to the former Kathleen Masiello (née McCue) of Washingtonville, New York. The couple have three children.\n\n"}

The Vulgate translation of the Bible uses \"sancta sanctorum\" for the Holy of Holies. Hence the derivative usage to denote the Sancta Sanctorum chapel in the complex of the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran, Rome.\n\nIn Hinduism, a temple's innermost part where the cult image \"(Murti)\" of the deity is kept forms the \"Garbha griha\", also referred to as a sanctum sanctorum.\n\nThe Latin word \"sanctum\" is the neuter form of the adjective \"holy\", and \"sanctorum\" its genitive plural. Thus the term \"sanctum sanctorum\" literally means \"the holy [place/thing] of the holy [places/things]\", replicating in Latin the Hebrew construction for the superlative, with the intended meaning \"the most holy [place/thing]\".\n\nThe Latin word \"sanctum\" may be used in English, following Latin, for \"a holy place\", or a sanctuary, as in the novel \"Jane Eyre\" (1848) which refers to \"the sanctum of school room\".\n\nRomance languages tend to use the form \"sancta sanctorum\", treating it as masculine and singular. E.g., the Spanish dictionary of the Real Academia Española admits \"sanctasanctórum\" (without the space and with an accent) as a derivative Spanish noun denoting both the Holy of Holies in the Temple in Jerusalem, any secluded and mysterious place, and something that a person holds in the highest esteem.\n\nThe term is still often used by Indian writers for the garbhagriha or inner shrine chamber in Hindu temple architecture, after being introduced by British writers in the 19th century.\n\nSome regional branches of the Catholic Church, e. g. Germans, are wont to refer to the Blessed Sacrament, when adored in the tabernacle or in exposition or procession (e.g. on Corpus Christi), as the Holy of Holies. By custom, It is adored with genuflection; with a double genuflection, that is a short moment of kneeling on both knees, if in exposition; in the procession this ritual may be nonrigoristically alleviated, but at least a simple genuflection is appropriate when It is elevated by the priest for blessing or immediately after transsubstantiation. Personnel in uniform — which in Germany includes student corporations — give the military salute when passing by or in the moment of elevation.\n\nThe \"garbhagriha\" in Hindu temple architecture (a shrine inside a temple complex where the main deity is installed in a separate building by itself inside the complex) has also been compared to a \"sanctum sanctorum\" in texts on Hindu temple architecture, though the Sanskrit term actually means \"enclosed house\" or \"the deep interior of the house\". However, some Indian English authors seem to have translated the Sanskrit term literally as \"womb house\". \n"}
{"id": "2148220", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2148220", "title": "Kajira", "text": "Kajira\n\nIn John Norman's \"Gor\" novels, a kajira is a female slave or slave girl.\n\nThe phrase \"\"la kajira\"\" is said to mean \"I am a slave girl.\" in the Gorean language, the most widely spoken lingua franca in the known regions of the planet Gor (this is one of the few complete Gorean-language sentences given in the Gor novels). The word is usually seen in the feminine form \"kajira\" (pl. \"kajirae\"), as most slaves in the Gorean lifestyle are female; the masculine forms are \"kajirus\" and \"kajiri\" (with endings taken from the nominative forms of Latin first and second declension nouns, as also seen in words such as \"alumna\"/\"alumnus\", etc.). The construction \"kajiras\" is incorrect, but is occasionally seen in third-party writing.\n\nThere exist various techniques in Gorean culture to teach Gorean slaves' corresponding conduct. Slave tasks may include not only sexual slavery, but also the ability to maintain a household, possess artistic skills, wear an appealing outfit and address the master in a certain manner.\n\nTo indicate a slave as a particular owner's property, a collar with the owner's name is placed upon the slave (male and female slaves are both collared).\n\nGorean slave women are usually branded, which means they are marked with certain signs burned into the flesh on being enslaved. The most common is the kef brand: \"about an inch and a half in height, and a half inch in width. A rather simple, delicate, graceful, almost floral mark, in cursive script. Appearing slender, more vertical, more like a stem with floral, cursive curled loops. A rather severe, straight line staff, with two, upturned, frondlike curls, adjacent to it, joined where they touch the staff on its right. It bears a distant, remote resemblance to the printed letter K.\"\n\nKajirae have a plethora of types of varying prestige depending on various characteristics, including the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKajiri (male slaves or slave boys) also exist on the planet Gor, but they are far fewer than kajirae, since Gorean men can only rarely be effectively \"tamed\", so that most male slaves are considered inherently slightly dangerous, and have little value other than as unskilled hard labor in work gangs which must often be kept under continual armed guard. Men conquered in war who are not left free are more often than not killed than enslaved, while women in the same situation are almost always enslaved (since kajirae are a readily-negotiable commodity, among other reasons).\n\nA male slave kept by a woman owner for bedroom duties is a \"silk slave\" (while most male slaves on Gor are used for unskilled hard labor in work gangs). When a free woman makes use of a kajirus sexually, he is often chained so that he is unable to hold her in his arms — since allowing this would be considered to add a note of male domination to the lovemaking. Some free women carefully avoid kissing a kajirus when making sexual use of him, since they would consider it degrading to soil their lips by touching them to the body of a mere slave. Note that only a small minority of rich free women on Gor own silk slaves and (in contrast to the usual situation with free men and kajirae) it is often not very easy or convenient for a free woman to obtain the sexual use of a kajirus whom she does not personally own (in the city of Ar, the largest city of known Gor, it is strictly forbidden by law).\n\nThe phrase \"lo kajirus\" is said to mean \"I am a slave boy.\" Silk slaves are generally despised by free men on Gor and their type of slavery is often considered to be rather unnatural. Kajiri do not usually wear locked collars; rather, they wear a band of iron.\n\n"}

He is one of only six drivers ever to win the USAC Triple Crown which includes the likes of Pancho Carter, Tony Stewart, Dave Darland, Jerry Coons Jr., and Tracy Hines.\n\nYeley won the 1997 edition of Indiana Sprintweek and captured the Rookie of the Year Award in the USAC National Sprint Car Series despite starting relatively few races.\n\nIn 1998, Yeley competed in four Indy Racing League (IRL) races, including the Indianapolis 500. His one top-10 finish in these four races was at Indianapolis, where he finished 9th despite a spin on the first turn of the first lap, which nearly collected eventual race winner Eddie Cheever, Jr.\n\nYeley also raced in the IRL in 2000 in an underfunded effort with McCormack Motorsports, but ultimately returned to USAC racing, picking up where he had left off by winning 2001 and 2003 National Sprint, 2002 and 2003 Silver Crown, and 2003 National Midget Series titles.\n\nHis championships in all three of USAC's top divisions in 2003 made him only the second driver, after Tony Stewart in 1995, to achieve the \"Triple Crown\" in a single season. Stewart was the owner of the Sprint and Silver Crown cars in Yeley's 2003 season; the Midget which Yeley drove in 2003, Steve Lewis' No. 9, had been driven by Stewart in 1995.\n\nYeley scored 24 USAC wins in his 2003 season, breaking the previous record of 19 set by A. J. Foyt in 1961 and later tied by Sleepy Tripp (1988) and Jay Drake (2000).\n\nAs had Stewart, Yeley signed with Joe Gibbs Racing, starting 17 of 34 races in the 2004 NASCAR Busch Series and achieving four Top 10 finishes. He also competed in two Nextel Cup Series races in No. 11 car and in the IROC series. Yeley drove the full season in 2005 in the NASCAR Busch Series for Gibbs' No. 18 car, posting twelve top-ten finishes and ending the season 11th in points. After the departure of Jason Leffler, who drove the No. 11 car in the Nextel Cup series, Yeley, Busch Series teammate Denny Hamlin, and Terry Labonte split the remaining races. Yeley drove four races, Labonte and Hamlin drove the final seven. Hamlin was named to drive the No. 11 FedEx-sponsored car for the 2006 season. Bobby Labonte made his announcement in November that he was leaving Joe Gibbs Racing. On November 12, at Phoenix International Raceway, Yeley was announced as the new driver for the No. 18 Interstate Batteries-sponsored Chevrolet.\n\nYeley ran full seasons with Joe Gibbs Racing in both the Nextel Cup and Busch Series in 2006. He drove the No. 18 Chevy in the Nextel Cup Series, and the No. 18 Vigoro/Home Depot-sponsored Chevrolet in the Busch Series. Yeley's best Nextel Cup finishes of 2006 came at California Speedway and Loudon, where he finished eighth; his best Busch Series finish came on June 17 at Kentucky Speedway. Yeley finished his 2006 season fifth in the Busch Series points standings with three poles, nine Top 5’s, and 22 top-10s. In the 2006 Bank of America 500, Yeley was running on the top of the track when he decided to cut down down the track to try to go to pit road. He ran right into Chase contender Mark Martin, and turned Mark head-on into the wall in a devastating crash. Martin's crew chief Pat Tryson had to be restrained by NASCAR officials as he showed his displeasure to Yeley, who also wrecked. The crash ended Mark Martin's championship hopes, as he was second in points before the incident. Despite racing for one of the best teams in the sport, Yeley would finish a dismal 29th in the points standings.\nHis 2007 season was filled with rumors about being released from Joe Gibbs Racing. At the 2007 Coca-Cola 600, Yeley scored a career-high second-place finish on a fuel gamble, with Casey Mears scoring the victory. Exactly three weeks later, at Michigan, Yeley took his first career pole at the Nextel Cup level, beating Jimmie Johnson by one-thousandth of a second (.001). During the middle of the 2007 season Joe Gibbs announced that his team would be switching to Toyota in 2008. Gibbs also announced that Yeley would not return for 2008. Gibbs ended up signing Kyle Busch to drive the No. 18.\n\nYeley moved to Hall of Fame Racing, an affiliate of JGR, replacing Tony Raines in the No. 96 DLP-sponsored Toyota. His struggles continued, as the team fell from being in the Top 35 every week with Raines behind the wheel to struggling to make races weekly (the team's first DNQ came with Yeley behind the wheel).\n\nOn July 5, he performed an in-race switch into the No. 20 car for an ill Tony Stewart. He ran strong for most of the race but was collected in two crashes within the last five laps and ended with a 20th-place finish. On August 6, 2008, Yeley was released from his contract to drive for Hall of Fame Racing, first by being replaced by P. J. Jones at Watkins Glen, Nationwide Series driver and Hall of Fame Racing test driver Brad Coleman at Michigan, and Ken Schrader for the remaining races. Yeley spent the rest of the season out of a ride. In 2009, he moved to the Camping World Truck Series, driving the No. 73 Chevrolet Silverado for Tagsby Racing. He was also named to take over the Mayfield Motorsports No. 41 Sprint Cup Series entry effective immediately following the indefinite suspension of owner/driver Jeremy Mayfield due to a substance abuse violation on May 9, 2009.\n\nLater in 2009, Yeley broke three cervical vertebrae during a crash in a USAC race.\nYeley drove at Daytona in 2010 for Daisy Ramirez Motorsports in the Camping World Truck Series. This was the team's debut and he finished a career-best 10th after starting 36th. Yeley was announced as the driver for the Whitney Motorsports No. 46 Sprint Cup Series car on May 4, 2010. On May 7, he qualified the No. 46 into the Showtime Southern 500 at Darlington. Yeley qualified for nine of the fourteen races he attempted. At the Coke Zero 400, he finished a team-best 19th. Yeley also raced for Latitude 43 Motorsports in Phoenix and Tommy Baldwin Racing, plus drove for Richard Petty Motorsports in a relief role at Charlotte, replacing a sick Kasey Kahne.\n\nYeley raced his way in the 2011 Daytona 500 in the Gatorade Duels for Whitney Motorsports, a team that failed to qualify for the 2010 event. He finished 43rd in the event after a blown engine eleven laps into the race. At Loudon, Yeley drove the No. 38 Front Row Motorsports entry in place of Travis Kvapil, who was unable to make the race due to his Truck Series commitments. He ran the remainder of the season in a fourth Front Row entry, the No. 55, with occasional races in the No. 38.\n\nFor 2012, Yeley signed with Robinson-Blakeney Racing to drive the No. 49 Toyota in the Sprint Cup Series. He also drove the team's No. 28 Nationwide Series car in that series' season-opening race at Daytona. Halfway through the season, Yeley moved to Max Q Motorsports to drive the No. 37 in a partnership with Tommy Baldwin Racing. Both the No. 49 and the No. 37 were mostly start and park efforts.\n\nIn 2013, Yeley moved to Tommy Baldwin Racing to drive the No. 36 Chevrolet, with a sponsorship from Golden Corral at races on superspeedways. United Mining, Accell Construction, and several other companies also served as primary sponsor throughout the season. Yeley finished 10th in his TBR debut in the Daytona 500, his first top ten since 2008. Yeley ran his first full season (in a non-start and park ride) for the first time since 2008, and finished 32nd in points. He was replaced by Reed Sorenson for 2014. On February 13, it was announced that Yeley would drive the No. 44 with Xxxtreme Motorsport starting at Phoenix. In late-April, the team purchased the No. 30 team from Swan Racing, with Yeley shifting to drive the new car number. Yeley replaced Ryan Truex in the No. 83 BK Racing Toyota at the Pure Michigan 400 after Truex suffered a concussion during a practice session. He later drove the team's start and park No. 93 at Richmond, and ran the last seven races in the 83 following Truex's dismissal from the team.\n\nIn 2015, Yeley moved to BK Racing full-time, replacing Alex Bowman in the No. 23 Toyota. He also ran full-time in the Xfinity Series for No. 28 Toyota for JGL Racing, whom he had joined partway through the 2014 season. Before Darlington, Yeley and BK Racing teammate Jeb Burton switched rides with Burton moving to the No. 23, while Yeley moved to the No. 26.\n\nIn 2016, Yeley had no rides for the Daytona weekend. However, on February 24, 2016, it was announced that Yeley will drive the No. 14 Toyota Camry for TriStar Motorsports in the Xfinity Series, starting at Atlanta. Yeley replaced David Starr in the No. 44 at Richmond due to Starr being sidelined with an illness; Yeley eventually took over the ride full-time.\n\nFor the 2017 O'Reilly Auto Parts 500 at Texas, Yeley made his return to the Cup Series, driving the No. 7 Chevrolet SS for Tommy Baldwin Racing, a team he last drove for in 2013. After starting 27th, he finished in the same position, four laps down.\n\nIn 2017, Yeley returned to the No. 14 of TriStar for the full season and a part-time schedule in the No. 7 for Tommy Baldwin Racing. On July 22, TriStar owner Mark Smith died, and the next week, Yeley finished a season-best sixth at Iowa Speedway.\n\nIn March 2018, Yeley drove the No. 55 car for Premium Motorsports in the STP 500 in the Cup Series, where he finished 31st. Two months later, Yeley joined NY Racing Team (formerly Xxxtreme Motorsport) for the Coca-Cola 600, driving the No. 7. In the 600, Yeley qualified 40th and finished 38th after retiring from the event on lap 191 with a fuel pump issue.\n\nIn the summer of 2018, Yeley made his return to the No. 23 car which was previously owned by his former team BK Racing. NY Racing, for several races fielded the No. 23 in coordination with BK, sharing the No. 23 charter and the Steakhouse Elite sponsorship. After BK's bankruptcy auction, Front Row Motorsports was awarded BK's assets and NY Racing continued their collaboration with Front Row to season's end before both teams parted ways.\n\nFor 2019, NY Racing planned to field the No. 7 Steakhouse Elite-sponsored Ford Mustang with Yeley as the driver for an undetermined number of races. Before the team formally entered any races, Yeley and Steakhouse Elite partnered with Rick Ware Racing for the Pocono 400 in June. In August, he debuted Ware's No. 54 car at Bristol. On November 14, RWR announced Yeley would race full-time for the team in the 2020 NASCAR Cup Series season.\n\nYeley failed to qualify for the 2020 Daytona 500 after finishing 21st in Duel 2 of the 2020 Bluegreen Vacations Duels.\n\n Season still in progress<br>\n\n"}

R. Jayewardene. Unlike the first unsuccessful JVP insurrection of 1971, the second insurrection was not an open revolt, but appeared to be a low intensity conflict that lasted from 1987 to 1989 with the JVP resorting to subversion, assassinations, raids and attacks on military and civilian targets.\n\nFormed in the 1960s by radical Marxist Rohana Wijeweera, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) launched an open revolt against the government under Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike in April 1971. Caught off guard the government was able to subdue the insurgency in a matter of weeks. The insurgency lead to the death of 4-5000 (unofficial) people and over 20,000 suspected rebels, mostly youth, were arrested in the amnesty period that followed. The arrested youth were released after rehabilitation.\n\nRohana Wijeweera and the leaders of the insurgency were sentenced to prison terms and the JVP banned. However all of them were released in 1977 by J. R. Jayewardene after the UNP formed a government after they won the general election under a general amnesty issued for those prosecuted under the infamous Criminal Justice Commission. \n\nDuring the early 1980s, as the Tamil insurgency to the north became more intense, there was a marked shift in the ideology and goals of the JVP. Initially Marxist in orientation, and claiming to represent the oppressed of both the Tamil and Sinhalese communities, the group emerged increasingly as a Sinhalese nationalist organization opposing any compromise with the Tamil insurgency. Rohana Wijeweera came in the third place at the presidential elections in 1982 and the Jayawardena government did not like their rise. There are no convincing evidence as to say whether JVP actively involved in 1983 ethnic riots, but it was once again banned with several other left wing parties and its leadership went underground.\n\nHaving been banned and driven underground, the JVP began preparing to topple the government. They began targeting opponents, carried out robberies to collect funds and began acquiring weapons. Usually collecting pistols and shotguns from owners who had gained gun licences from the government. Thereafter they planned to raid armories of the government, who had deployed its forces to the north and east of the country to counter the Tamil militancy. On 15 December 1986, the JVP abducted and murdered Daya Pathirana, leader of the Independent Students Union (ISU) of University of Colombo, which was a rival student union of the JVP. \n\nOn 15 April 1987, JVP attacked the Pallekele Army Camp in Kandy. Lead by a former soldier, Mahinda under the directions of Shantha Bandara, the JVP seized 12 Type 56 assault rifles, seven sub-machine guns and ammunition. In May 1987, the Sri Lanka Armed Forces launched the Vadamarachchi Operation (Operation Liberation) with the objective of defeating the LTTE militarily and re-establishing government control in areas dominated by Tamil militants. However, the second phase of Operation Liberation was abandoned with the Indian intervention by Operation Poomalai. Which lead to the signing of the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord in Colombo on 29 July 1987 and arrival of the first troops in the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) on 30 July.\n\nThe prospect of Tamil autonomy in the north together with the presence of Indian troops stirred up a wave of Sinhalese nationalism and a sudden growth of anti-government violence by a new group that emerged as an offshoot of the JVP—the Patriotic Liberation Organization (Deshapremi Janatha Viyaparaya—DJV) led by Saman Piyasiri Fernando. On 7 June 1987, Sri Lanka Air Force Base, SLAF Katunayake and the Kotelawala Defence Academy were attacked and weapons and ammunition were stolen, while four of the attackers were killed. DJV claimed responsibility and the Criminal Investigation Department investigation resulted in 13 JVP members arrested. On 18 August, when the first parliamentary group meeting took place after the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord, assassination attempt was made on the president and prime minister, resulting in the deaths of two, including a Member of Parliament (MP). Lalith Athulathmudali, the Minister National Security and Deputy Minister of Defence was severely wounded. The investigation into the raid on the Pallekelle army camp in April 1987, resulted in the discharge of thirty-seven soldiers suspected of having links with the JVP. \n\nThe DJV thereafter launched a campaign of intimidation against the government and the ruling United National Party (UNP) party, killing more than seventy members of parliament between July and November 1989. Organised in cells of three people and based around Matara in the south, the JVP murdered probably thousands of people and crippled the country with violently-enforced hartals (general strikes) for two years. Individuals or organizations were warned or intimidated with messages dropped in the night to homes or posters or graffiti that appeared over night. Those that did not cooperate were brutally killed, with the repercussions extended to their family members. Executions were mostly carried out at night with armed groups coming to the homes of the victims and carrying them away to be tortured, executed and left as an example, while occasional bombings took place. In most cases the funerals of these victims were not allowed by the JVP, traditional final rights were not allowed and the caskets were to be carried below knee level as a mark of disrespect. With these techniques of fear and intimidation the JVP was able to bring the country to stand still. Acts of sabotage were common, with destruction of government property, electric transformers were a common target. Killings took place in both urban and rural areas and the government seemed powerless in the face of it. One of the key police officers leading the effort to counter the JVP, Senior Superintendent of Police Terrence Perera, Director of Counter Subversive Unit was killed by the JVP gunmen in Battaramulla on 3 December 1987 and Harsha Abhayawardene, UNP General Secretary was killed by the JVP gunmen in Wellawatte on 23 December 1987. Killings continued into 1987, on 7 February Mervyn Cooray, Member of Parliament for Panadura survived an assassination attempt, on 1 May; Nandalal Fernando the new UNP General Secretary was killed; G.V.S. de Silva, Galle District Minister was shot dead that month; Lionel Jayatilleke, Minister of Relief and Rehabilitation was shot dead on 26 September 1988 and on 21 October Tudor Keerthinanda, UNP Working Committee Member was killed. 1989 saw the killing of Senior Superintendent of Police Bennet Perera, former Director - CID, who was gunned down, at Mount Lavinia on 1 May 1989, Assistant Superintendent of Police Shahabdeen, Security Officer - Minister of Transport was killed on 23 August 1989, Captain B. M. Perera of the military police was shot dead in Moratuwa on 12 September 1989. Close to 50 school principals were killed, along with tea planters (Tea estate superintendents), public servants and clergy between 1988 and 1989 for defying JVP orders sent via short memos known as \"chits\". Many professionals were also killed for defying JVP orders these included Dr Gladys Jayawardene, Chairperson, State Pharmaceuticals Corporation; D. C. Athukorale, Chief Engineer, Colombo Port Authority; Liayana Pathirana, Working Director, Salt Corporation. 102 Sri Lanka Freedom Party supporters and 64 United Socialist Alliance supporters were also killed. over 30 Buddhist monks were killed. Many businessmen were killed including the Shanmugam brothers, K. Gunaratnam and Shabeer Hussain. Several Indian expats were also killed, including Mr. and Mrs. Banshall working at the Pelwatta Sugar Factory, D. K. Sundaram, P. Nadar Weeramuni and Ann Herchoi.\n\nAlthough much of the insurgency was a low intensity conflict, with targeted assassinations and intimidation. Major attacks include the 1987 grenade attack in the Sri Lankan Parliament and 1989 Temple of the Tooth attack. In addition the militant wing of the JVP led by Saman Piyasiri Fernando staged several major attacks on military installations in the south of the island. These included; \n\n\nIn many of these attacks, the JVP targeted the armories capturing weapons and ammunition that it claimed to use against Indian Peace Keeping Forces. In total the JVP killed 342 police personnel and 209 armed forces personnel. \n\nThe JVP made a serious misjudgment when, through the DJV, it called for the killing of members of the families of the security personal. This destroyed the small but significant amount of support that it enjoyed among the lower ranks of the armed forces, and made it possible for the government to justify its campaign of terror. Most notable of the attacks on families of the security personal, was the attack on family of Deputy Inspector General of Police Premadasa c. On 24 July 1988, his ancestral home in Poddala was surrounded and set ablaze by suspected members of the JVP, Udugampola's mother, brother, sister-in-law and two small children were killed in the fire. Following this Udugampola began a ruthless crackdown of the JVP in the Southern and Central provinces. As a means of pacifying the support base of JVP, a wide range of acts of cruelty, including the torture and mass murder of school children, who were allegedly JVP supporters, was carried out by the state.\n\nGovernment forces attached to Operation Combine captured JVP leader Rohana Wijeweera in Ulapane and brought to Colombo, where the government claimed 13 November 1989 that Wijeweera was shot and killed by H.B. Herath during a search operation. By early 1990 they had killed or imprisoned the remaining JVP politburo, including its military wing leader Saman Piyasiri Fernando and detained an estimated 7,000 JVP members. Although the Government won a decisive military victory there were credible accusations of brutality and extrajudicial killings.\n\nAccording to international terrorism expert Dr. Rohan Gunaratna's research, JVP killed 30 politicians, 23 academics, 1 clergy, 2 government officials, 89 civilians and 61 service personnel, from July 1987 to January 1990. Rest of the killings (21 armed fighters) are attributed to state or state sponsored death squads. A European delegation estimated the total death toll to be 60,000, while more conservative estimates have placed the death toll at 35,000, with the vast majority being perpetrated by state-sponsored death squads.\n\nFollowing the insurrection, the JVP was relaunched and participated in electoral politics. At the parliamentary elections held on 2 April 2004, the party was part of the United People's Freedom Alliance that won 45.6% of the popular vote and 105 out of 225 seats. As the second partner in this alliance it became part of the government. It also supported the winning candidate Mahinda Rajapakse in the 2005 parliamentary election. Along with the UNP it supported General Sarath Fonseka in the 2010 presidential election.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2148265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2148265", "title": "Pea-pickers", "text": "Pea-pickers\n\nA pea-picker is a derogatory reference to poor, migrant workers during the Great Depression. These people were unskilled, poorly educated workers, employable only in menial jobs, such as harvesting crops and, as such, received poor wages for working long hours under dreadful conditions. Some of these people were photographed by Dorothea Lange.\n\nThe term \"pea picker\" is used to distinguish a group as a lower social class from some other similar group, such as the \"pea-picking\" Smiths, as opposed to the \"respectable\" Smiths. Temporary communities of pea-pickers are called pea picker camps and farms that employed them were pea-picker farms.\n\nDuring the Great Depression, the American government, without due process, deported between 1 and 2 million American citizens and legal residents of Mexican descent. This mass deportation, known as the Mexican Repatriation, took place from 1929 to 1939 and was empowered by panic of an alarmingly high unemployment rate sweeping over the United States at this time. The Dust Bowl was the name given to the Great Plains region devastated by drought in 1930s depression-ridden America. This triggered the migration of men, women, and children seeking work, food, and shelter making their way to California, hoping to find opportunity and a better life. Most of the migrants moving west were not farmers, having lived either in a town or city doing some kind of blue-collar work. They headed west unaware of the poor living conditions and only seasonal work that largely depended on the weather. The Midwesterners impacted by both the Depression and Dust Bowl packed up their families and relocated in hopes of finding a chance at the American dream, having realized that the drought and dust storms would not end anytime soon. Some sold what they could not bring along and began to drive west on Route 66. The term pea-picker was used to describe these particular group migrant workers in a negative context. The workers who picked these peas before the Dust Bowl migration and Mexican Repatriation had taken place were mostly Mexicans, Filipinos, and single white males before the Depression. This new work force of unskilled migrant families from the Dust Bowl now took their place and helped coin the term pea-pickers.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2148294", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2148294", "title": "John Corabi", "text": "John Corabi\n\nJohn Corabi (born April 26, 1959) is an American hard rock singer and guitarist. He was the frontman of The Scream during 1989. He was also the frontman of Mötley Crüe between 1992 and 1996 during original frontman Vince Neil's hiatus from the band.\n\nCorabi is considered a \"rock journeyman\" with a long list of collaborations with established acts such as Angora , Union and ESP (both with former Kiss lead guitarist Bruce Kulick), Ratt (as a guitarist), Twenty 4 Seven (with his then Ratt bandmate Bobby Blotzer), Zen Lunatic, Brides of Destruction, and Angel City Outlaws (with his then Ratt bandmates Robbie Crane and Bobby Blotzer, and former Ratt guitarist Keri Kelli, who he replaced in Ratt). He was the lead singer for supergroup The Dead Daisies.\n\nAfter Mötley Crüe parted ways with lead singer Vince Neil in February 1992, Corabi was hired as his replacement. Bassist Nikki Sixx and drummer Tommy Lee stated that Corabi was capable of singing anything and everything and that was the reason they chose him. Corabi recorded the self-titled \"Mötley Crüe\" album in 1994 and the EP \"Quaternary\". Though the music was heavier and more elaborate than the rest of the Mötley Crüe catalog, it did not sell as well as previous releases from the band. Before a concert in Tucson, Arizona which had a 15,000 seat capacity, only 4,000 tickets were sold, Nikki Sixx decided to call into a Tucson area radio station and offer any fan who showed up free tickets. When only two people took Sixx up on his offer, Sixx stated he knew this version of the band was finished. During the early stages of the writing of a new album which would become \"Generation Swine\", Mötley Crüe's record label refused to provide funds to record the album unless Vince Neil was let back in the band. Rather than hiring another label, Mötley Crüe acceded to the demand and by 1997, Corabi departed the band and Neil returned. Many of the songs from the early writing session were used on the album and Corabi is credited on the liner notes for co-writing some of the songs.\n\nCorabi and the rest of Mötley Crüe made personal appearances at London's Hard Rock Cafe at a private party in February 1994 promoting their self-titled \"Mötley Crüe\" album. The evening was also attended by many Mötley Crüe competition winners who were invited into the VIP area to chat to Corabi, as well as the other 3 band members.\n\nCorabi spoke about his time with the band and his thoughts on the first record with Mötley Crüe. Corabi said: \"my record was the first record that they had done that didn't go platinum, didn't make some sort of crazy noise, and everybody panicked\".\n\nIn July 2015, Corabi and his band performed at a bar and played all of the songs off of the Mötley Crüe album. Weeks after the performance, Corabi stated \"The album would have made it if this was under a different band name\".\n\nUnion was formed with John Corabi, Bruce Kulick (recently released from KISS), Brent Fitz, and Jamie Hunting. John and Bruce wrote what would become the first Union album (self titled) and proceeded with a nationwide acoustic tour, to promote the album, featuring just Corabi and Kulick (both on guitar). Soon the full band went on a world tour headlining small venues in support of the Union album. The second album \"Live in the Galaxy\" was a live recording with two acoustic tracks recorded in a mobile studio. The third and final Union album, The Blue Room, was a more polished sound than the first studio CD. Union never officially called it quits (playing live shows every so often with guest drummers and bass players), but with Kulick playing along with Grand Funk Railroad, Corabi playing with many bands, most notably Ratt, and both members being tied up in solo projects, Union will probably never return to write new studio material.\n\nESP also featured guitarist Bruce Kulick, bassist Karl Cochran, and drummer Eric Singer. Ace Frehley makes a special appearance on the Hendrix cover \"Foxy Lady\".\n\nTwenty 4 Seven, a collaboration with Corabi, drummer Bobby Blotzer (Ratt, Contraband), and guitarist Rob Marcello (Ironhorse, Obsession, Danger Danger) recorded 10 hard rock tracks entitled \"Destination Everywhere\" (US, 2002).\n\nIn early 2004, Corabi joined Jerry Cantrell's covers band Cardboard Vampyres. Also in the band were The Cult guitarist Billy Duffy, The Cult bassist Chris Wyse and drummer Josh Howser. The band played at various venues in the United States between 2004 and 2005. They predominately played along the West Coast. No albums were released by the band.\n\nCorabi was featured as second guitarist on Brides of Destruction's 2004 album \"Here Comes The Brides\". He had multiple reasons for leaving the band. One was the fact that he was told it would be an effort much like the \"Mötley Crüe\" album. Secondly, he did not get along very well with Tracii Guns. He also said in an interview that \"when Nikki told me about the band, I was really into the idea of writing another CD with the heavy sound of the Mötley Crüe album, but as we got more into recording, we had our drummer singing what was supposed to be the best song on the CD, when Nikki and Tracii were saying that our singer was the hot new thing, it just did not make sense to me.\"\n\nEarly in 2008, Corabi attended the Motley Cruise, a 4-day cruise in the Caribbean (Miami, Key West and Cozumel, Mexico) including performers such as Vince Neil, Skid Row, Ratt, Slaughter, Endeverafter and Lynam. On this cruise, Corabi joined Vince Neil on stage to perform \"Highway to Hell\" by AC/DC. This performance was a unique event as fans witnessed the two Mötley Crüe vocalists share the same microphone.

It is named after H.S.M. Coxeter.\n\nNote that this article assumes a finite Coxeter group. For infinite Coxeter groups, there are multiple conjugacy classes of Coxeter elements, and they have infinite order.\n\nThere are many different ways to define the Coxeter number \"h\" of an irreducible root system.\n\nA Coxeter element is a product of all simple reflections. The product depends on the order in which they are taken, but different orderings produce conjugate elements, which have the same order.\n\n\nThe Coxeter number for each Dynkin type is given in the following table:\n\nThe invariants of the Coxeter group acting on polynomials form a polynomial algebra\nwhose generators are the fundamental invariants; their degrees are given in the table above. \nNotice that if \"m\" is a degree of a fundamental invariant then so is \"h\" + 2 − \"m\".\n\nThe eigenvalues of a Coxeter element are the numbers \"e\" as \"m\" runs through the degrees of the fundamental invariants. Since this starts with \"m\" = 2, these include the primitive \"h\"th root of unity, \"ζ\" = \"e\", which is important in the Coxeter plane, below.\n\nThere are relations between the order \"g\" of the Coxeter group, and the Coxeter number \"h\":\n\nAn example, [3,3,5] has \"h\"=30, so 64*30/g = 12 - 3 - 6 - 5 + 4/3 + 4/5 = 2/15, so g = 1920*15/2= 960*15 = 14400.\n\nDistinct Coxeter elements correspond to orientations of the Coxeter diagram (i.e. to Dynkin quivers): the simple reflections corresponding to source vertices are written first, downstream vertices later, and sinks last. (The choice of order among non-adjacent vertices is irrelevant, since they correspond to commuting reflections.) A special choice is the alternating orientation, in which the simple reflections are partitioned into two sets of non-adjacent vertices, and all edges are oriented from the first to the second set. The alternating orientation produces a special Coxeter element \"w\" satisfying formula_1, where \"w\" is the longest element, and we assume the Coxeter number \"h\" is even.\n\nFor formula_2, the symmetric group on \"n\" elements, Coxeter elements are certain \"n\"-cycles: \nthe product of simple reflections formula_3 is the Coxeter element formula_4. For \"n\" even, the alternating orientation Coxeter element is:\nThere are formula_6 distinct Coxeter elements among the formula_7 \"n\"-cycles.\n\nThe dihedral group Dih is generated by two reflections that form an angle of formula_8, and thus their product is a rotation by formula_9.\n\nFor a given Coxeter element \"w,\" there is a unique plane \"P\" on which \"w\" acts by rotation by 2π/\"h.\" This is called the Coxeter plane and is the plane on which \"P\" has eigenvalues \"e\" and \"e\" = \"e\". This plane was first systematically studied in , and subsequently used in to provide uniform proofs about properties of Coxeter elements.\n\nThe Coxeter plane is often used to draw diagrams of higher-dimensional polytopes and root systems – the vertices and edges of the polytope, or roots (and some edges connecting these) are orthogonally projected onto the Coxeter plane, yielding a Petrie polygon with \"h\"-fold rotational symmetry. For root systems, no root maps to zero, corresponding to the Coxeter element not fixing any root or rather axis (not having eigenvalue 1 or −1), so the projections of orbits under \"w\" form \"h\"-fold circular arrangements and there is an empty center, as in the E diagram at above right. For polytopes, a vertex may map to zero, as depicted below. Projections onto the Coxeter plane are depicted below for the Platonic solids.\n\nIn three dimensions, the symmetry of a regular polyhedron, {p,q}, with one directed petrie polygon marked, defined as a composite of 3 reflections, has rotoinversion symmetry S, [2,h], order \"h\". Adding a mirror, the symmetry can be doubled to antiprismatic symmetry, D, [2,h], order 2\"h\". In orthogonal 2D projection, this becomes dihedral symmetry, Dih, [h], order 2\"h\".\n\nIn four dimensions, the symmetry of a regular polychoron, {p,q,r}, with one directed Petrie polygon marked is a double rotation, defined as a composite of 4 reflections, with symmetry +/[C×C] (John H. Conway), (C/C;C/C) (#1', Patrick du Val (1964)), order \"h\".\n\nIn five dimensions, the symmetry of a regular 5-polytope, {p,q,r,s}, with one directed Petrie polygon marked, is represented by the composite of 5 reflections.\nIn dimensions 6 to 8 there are 3 exceptional Coxeter groups, one uniform polytope from each dimension represents the roots of the E Exceptional lie groups. The Coxeter elements are 12, 18 and 30 respectively.\n\n"}

Three PacifiCat catamarans were built between 1996 and 2000 as part of a major public project which ultimately failed: \"PacifiCat Explorer\" (launched 1998), \"PacifiCat Discovery\" (launched 1999), and \"PacifiCat Voyager\" (launched 2000). \"Explorer\" and \"Discovery\" were briefly used for revenue service between Horseshoe Bay in West Vancouver and Departure Bay in Nanaimo. The third ship in the class, \"PacifiCat Voyager\", was completed but never entered the BC Ferries fleet. The PacifiCat project started in June, 1994 with an estimated total cost of $210 million. By the time the ships were finished, it had actually cost $463 million. A 1999 report by the Auditor-General of British Columbia concluded that the fast ferry project had been beset by \"significant breakdowns in both governance and risk management.\"\n\nCar ferry service on the route between Horseshoe Bay, West Vancouver and Departure Bay, Nanaimo had originally been started by the private Black Ball Line in June 1953. Black Ball was purchased by the government of British Columbia on November 30, 1961 and its routes absorbed into the BC Ferries system.\n\nBoth the Horseshoe Bay and Departure Bay ferry terminals are located within residential areas. Departure Bay terminal is located at Vancouver Island's northern tip of their part of the Trans-Canada Highway (Nanaimo). Horseshoe Bay is the mainland connection to the Trans-Canada Highway freeway. In addition, the Horseshoe Bay terminal is located in a very small cove next to a commercial marina and there have been several collisions between pleasure craft and ferries over the years.\n\nThe provincial government was aware of these issues as early as 1972, when a Ministry of Highways report recommended developing a new ferry route between Iona Island south of Vancouver and Gabriola Island south of Nanaimo. Another report recommending the same solution was produced in 1988. This proposed route is 22 kilometres shorter than the current route and would have also eliminated the problems with ferry terminal traffic. Ultimately, the government did build a new ferry terminal for Nanaimo: Duke Point, which opened in 1997 and which serves as terminus for the ferry route from Tsawwassen. Duke Point was intended to divert truck traffic away from the Horsesehoe Bay-Departure Bay route. This situation was the starting point from which the fast ferry project developed.\n\nIn 1992, BC Ferries and the government began reviewing the issue of ferry service to Nanaimo. The final report, completed in January 1994, neither supported nor endorsed the use of fast ferries for service between Horseshoe Bay and Departure Bay. At a meeting in February 1994 that involved the minister responsible for BC Ferries, the corporation's management indicated that using fast ferries required \"further extensive analysis.\" Their advice was ignored, and less than two months later the minister responsible, Glen Clark, ordered the ferry corporation to cede control over its long-term planning to the government. After the government finished drafting the plan, Clark pressed the BC Ferries board for a quick approval, and the Auditor-General's report about the fast ferries partly blames him for rushing the fast ferries into production.\n\nThe result was a ten-year capital plan which had been crafted by the government. It bypassed leasing a fast ferry for trials in BC waters and went directly to implementation. Several other projects previously considered essential, such as replacing one of the northern ferries, were deferred in favour of the fast ferries. In addition, the construction of the fast ferries would be used to revitalise the province's shipbuilding industry, furthering policy goals beyond merely improving ferry service to Nanaimo. The BC Ferries board, which was required to rubberstamp the plan, noted several concerns about the fast ferry aspect when asking the cabinet to give it final approval.\n\nA public announcement of the fast ferry project was made in June, 1994; it had been decided to immediately proceed with building three fast ferries. The government claimed the fast ferries would cost $210 million total, and Clark later insisted that this figure had included everything \"right down to the toilet paper.\" The truth was that little actual analysis had been done: not even the type of ship (single hull or catamaran), nor their dimensions had even been determined when the $210 million figure was announced.\n\nThe government hoped that private shipyards would be able to build the ships on a fixed-cost basis. This turned out not to be the case; the shipbuilding industry was less enthusiastic than anticipated. Moreover, none of the shipyards being considered for the work had the facilities to build the fast ferries. BC Ferries had no choice but to do the work itself on a cost-plus basis. It would have to act as project manager and assume the risk of the fast ferries. Catamaran Ferries International (CFI), a wholly owned subsidiary of BC Ferries, was incorporated in March 1996 to carry out the work and construction started later that year.\n\nThe CFI board was suddenly replaced a year later with a new one whose members were either part of CFI management, had significant business ties to the company, or already served on BC Ferries board. According to the Auditor-General's report, this is a textbook example of poor corporate governance. It \"created the awkward accountability relationship of having board members account to themselves for their performance.\"\n\nOn March 1, 2000, Joy MacPhail, then the minister responsible for BC Ferries, recommended to the government that it abandon the PacifiCat project, calling it \"a failed experiment.\" Her colleagues agreed, and the ships were put up for sale at an asking price of $120 million for all three. They turned out to be difficult to sell, due to their highly specialised design and a saturated market.\n\nAfter a change of government in May 2001, and more attempts to sell at a higher price, the ships were finally put up for auction in March 2003 and were sold to the Washington Marine Group for $19.4 million CAD, 4.2% of what it cost to build them. Washington Marine Group announced on July 28, 2009 that they had sold the three ships for an undisclosed amount to Abu Dhabi MAR, a luxury yacht builder.\n\nIn late 2014 the U.A.E. donated all three ferries to the Egyptian government.\n\nThe PacifiCats were designed by Philip Hercus of Australia and Robert Allan Limited of Vancouver. Hercus developed the hull form and Robert Allan handled the outfitting aspects of the design. The PacifiCats were custom-designed to fit BC Ferries' docks, which allow simultaneous loading on two full-length roll-through vehicle decks. This trait gives the PacifiCats their unique appearance in comparison with other fast ferries.\n\nOnce the design was complete, CFI divided the construction work into over a hundred modules, built by a variety of BC companies. Completed modules were transported to CFI's facility in North Vancouver and assembled there. This was done both to stimulate the shipbuilding industry and to make it unnecessary to build a much larger facility for the PacifiCat construction.\n\nThe fast ferries were intended to achieve crossing times that were 30 minutes faster than those of conventional ferries, making twelve crossings per day rather than eight. Although they initially achieved this crossing time, complaints of the wash of the ships wake forced the ferries to take a longer route, and operate a slower speed around Bowen Island. An archived version of BC Ferries website stated in the year 2000 that a PacifiCat sailing was 1 hour 20 minutes, only 15 minutes shorter than a sailing with a regular vessel (1 hour 35 minutes).\n\n"}
{"id": "2148320", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2148320", "title": "Taras Bulba", "text": "Taras Bulba\n\nTaras Bulba (; ) is a romanticized historical novella by Nikolai Gogol. It describes the life of an old Zaporozhian Cossack, Taras Bulba, and his two sons, Andriy and Ostap. The sons study at the Kiev Academy and then return home, whereupon the three men set out on a journey to the Zaporizhian Sich (the Zaporizhian Cossack headquarters, located in southern Ukraine), where they join other Cossacks and go to war against Poland.\n\nThe main character is based on several historical personalities, and other characters are not as exaggerated or grotesque as was common in Gogol's later fiction. The story can be understood in the context of the Romantic nationalism movement in literature, which developed around a historical ethnic culture which meets the Romantic ideal.\n\nInitially published in 1835 as part of a collection of stories, it was much more abridged and evinced some differences in the storyline compared with the better known 1842 edition, the latter having been described by Victor Erlich as a \"paragon of civic virtue and a force of patriotic edification\" while the first being \"distinctly Cossack jingoism\".\n\nThe character of Taras Bulba, the main hero of this novel, is a composite of several historical personalities. It might be based on the real family history of an ancestor of Nicholas Miklouho-Maclay, Cossak Ataman Okhrim Makukha from Starodub, who killed his son Nazar for switching to the Polish side during the Khmelnytsky Uprising. Nicholas Miklouho-Maclay's uncle, Grigory Illich Miklouho-Maclay, studied together with Gogol in Nizhyn Gymnasium and probably told the family legend to Gogol. Another possible inspiration was the hero of the folk song \"The deeds of Sava Chaly\", published by Mykhaylo Maksymovych, about Cossack captain Sava Chaly (executed in 1741 after serving as a colonel in the private army of a Polish noble), whose killing was ordered by his own father for betraying the Ukrainian cause.\n\nTaras Bulba's two sons, Ostap and Andriy, return home from an Orthodox seminary in Kiev. Ostap is the more adventurous, whereas Andriy has deeply romantic feelings of an introvert. While in Kiev, he fell in love with a young Polish noble girl, the daughter of the Governor of Kowno, but after a couple of meetings (edging into her house and in church), he stopped seeing her when her family returned home. Taras Bulba gives his sons the opportunity to go to war. They reach the Cossack camp at the Zaporozhian Sich, where there is much merrymaking. Taras attempts to rouse the Cossacks to go into battle. He rallies them to replace the existing Hetman when the Hetman is reluctant to break the peace treaty.\n\nThey soon have the opportunity to fight the Poles, who rule all Ukraine west of the Dnieper River. The Poles, led by their ultra-Catholic king, are accused of atrocities against Orthodox Christians, in which they are aided by Jews. After killing many of the Jewish merchants at the Sich, the Cossacks set off on a campaign against the Poles. They besiege Dubno Castle where, surrounded by the Cossacks and short of supplies, the inhabitants begin to starve. One night a Tatar woman comes to Andriy and rouses him. He finds her face familiar and then recalls she is the servant of the Polish girl he was in love with. She advises him that all are starving inside the walls. He accompanies her through a secret passage starting in the marsh that goes into the monastery inside the city walls. Andriy brings loaves of bread with him for the starving girl and her mother. He is horrified by what he sees and in a fury of love, forsakes his heritage for the Polish girl.\n\nMeanwhile, several companies of Polish soldiers march into Dubno to relieve the siege, and destroy a regiment of Cossacks. A number of battles ensue. Taras learns of his son's betrayal from Yankel the Jew, whom he saved earlier in the story. During one of the final battles, he sees Andriy riding in Polish garb from the castle and has his men draw him to the woods, where he takes him off his horse. Taras bitterly scolds his son, telling him \"I gave you life, I will take it\", and shoots him dead.\n\nTaras and Ostap continue fighting the Poles. Ostap is captured while his father is knocked out. When Taras regains consciousness he learns that his son was taken prisoner by the Poles. Yankel agrees to take Taras to Warsaw, where Ostap is held captive, hiding Taras in a cartload of bricks. Once in Warsaw, a group of Jews help Yankel dress Taras as a German count. They go into the prison to see Ostap, but Taras unwittingly reveals himself as a Cossack, and only escapes by use of a great bribe. Instead, they attend the execution the following day. During the execution, Ostap does not make a single sound, even while being broken on the wheel, but, disheartened as he nears death, he calls aloud on his father, unaware of his presence. Taras answers him from the crowd, thus giving himself away, but manages to escape.\n\nTaras returns home to find all of his old Cossack friends dead and younger Cossacks in their place. He goes to war again. The new Hetman wishes to make peace with the Poles, which Taras is strongly against, warning that the Poles are treacherous and will not honour their words. Failing to convince the Hetman, Taras takes his regiment away to continue the assault independently. As Taras predicted, once the new Hetman agrees to a truce, the Poles betray him and kill a number of Cossacks. Taras and his men continue to fight and are finally caught in a ruined fortress, where they battle until the last man is defeated.\n\nTaras is nailed and tied to a tree and set aflame. Even in this state, he calls out to his men to continue the fight, claiming that a new Tsar is coming who will rule the earth. The story ends with Cossacks on the Dniester River recalling the great feats of Taras and his unwavering Cossack spirit.\n\nFor reasons that are currently disputed, the 1842 edition was expanded by three chapters and included Russian nationalist themes. Potential reasons include a necessity to stay in line with the official tsarist ideology, as well as the author's changing political and aesthetic views (later manifested in \"Dead Souls\" and \"Selected Passages from Correspondence with his Friends\"). The changes included three new chapters and a new ending (in the 1835 edition, the protagonist is not burned at the stake by the Poles). The little-known original edition was only translated into Ukrainian and made available to the Ukrainian audience in 2005.\n\nFelix Dreizin and David Guaspari in their \"The Russian Soul and the Jew: Essays in Literary Ethnocentrism\" discuss anti-semitism, pointing out Gogol's attachment to \"anti-Jewish prejudices prevalent in Russian and Ukrainian culture\". In Léon Poliakov's \"The History of Antisemitism\", the author states that \"The 'Yankel' from \"Taras Bulba\" indeed became the archetypal Jew in Russian literature. Gogol painted him as supremely exploitative, cowardly, and repulsive, albeit capable of gratitude. There is a scene in \"Taras Bulba\" where Jews are thrown into a river, a scene where Taras Bulba visits the Jews and seeks their aid, and reference by the narrator of the story that Jews are treated inhumanely.\n\nFollowing the 1830–1831 November Uprising against the Russian imperial rule in the heartland of Poland – partitioned since 1795 – the Polish people became the subject of an official campaign of discrimination by the Tsarist authorities. \"Practically all of the Russian government, bureaucracy, and society were united in one outburst against the Poles. The phobia that gripped society gave a new powerful push to the Russian national solidarity movement\" – wrote historian Liudmila Gatagova. It was in this particular context that many of Russia's literary works and popular media of the time became hostile toward the Poles in accordance with the state policy, especially after the emergence of the Panslavist ideology, accusing them of betraying the \"Slavic family\".\nAccording to sociologist and historian Prof. Vilho Harle, \"Taras Bulba\", published only four years after the rebellion, was a part of this anti-Polish propaganda effort. Inadvertently, Gogol's accomplishment became \"an anti-Polish novel of high literary merit, to say nothing about lesser writers.\"\n\nAs in other Russian novels of the era, Turks are treated as barbaric and uncivilized compared to Europeans because of their nomadic nature.\n\nThe story was the basis of an opera, \"Taras Bulba\", by Ukrainian composer Mykola Lysenko, first performed in 1924 some 12 years after the composer's death. The opera's libretto was written by Mykhailo Starytsky, the composer's cousin.\n\nCzech composer Leoš Janáček's \"Taras Bulba\", a symphonic rhapsody for orchestra, was written in the years 1915–1918, inspired in part by the mass slaughter of World War I. The composition was first performed on 9 October 1921 by František Neumann, and in Prague on 9 November 1924 by Václav Talich and the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\nThe story has been adapted to film many times:\n\n\n"}

The normative principle teaches that whatever is not prohibited in Scripture is permitted in worship, as long as it is agreeable to the peace and unity of the Church. In short, there must be agreement with the general practice of the Church and no prohibition in Scripture for whatever is done in worship.\n\nThe normative principle is often contrasted with the regulative principle of worship, which teaches that only those practices or elements which are specifically commanded or modelled in Scripture are to be permitted in worship services.\n\nAn example of the difference between these two principles of worship (normative and regulative) can be illustrated by the example of announcing notices in church (i.e. news, upcoming events, and other information). The normative principle holds that since such activity is not prohibited in the New Testament, and since announcing notices may well be beneficial for the congregation and their involvement in the activities of the church, then this practice should be permitted. On the other hand, the regulative principle would ban such activity from taking place in the church service, because no example of announcing notices at the church gathering can be found in the New Testament.\n\nHistorically, the definition of the normative principle concerned replicating scriptural patterns, i.e. norms. Dr. Peter Masters of the Metropolitan Tabernacle wrote an article on this subject and explained that the historic distinction is different to the one above. Historically, regulative meant simply obeying direct instructions, whereas normative meant not just the requirements of the regulative principle, but also replicating patterns established by the scriptures. One example of this concerns congregationalist polity in respect of church government: - proponents of this polity point to the biblical norm of churches being individually autonomous.\n\n\n"}

She was educated at Monash University, where she graduated in agricultural economics.\n\nDuring the period between her endorsement as a candidate for the 1996 election and 1 July 1996, when she took her seat, Ferris was employed by Senator Nick Minchin. It was suggested that this constituted holding \"an office of profit under the Crown\", which under section 44 of the Constitution could have rendered her election invalid, although the writ had not been returned and she was technically not a senator-elect. To avoid any possibility of this, she resigned from the Senate on 12 July 1996, and was immediately re-appointed by the Parliament of South Australia to the vacancy caused by her own resignation.\n\nFerris was Deputy Government Whip in the Senate from 2001 to 2002 and was Government Whip in the Senate from August 2002 until her death.\n\nA year after her diagnosis with ovarian cancer in October 2005, Ferris formed a parliamentary inquiry into gynaecological cancers with Senators Lyn Allison and Claire Moore, which led to a unanimous report across party lines calling for increased research and awareness of the cancers. The Commonwealth Government later agreed to the report's recommendations.\n\nIn December 2003, Ferris was involved in the resignation of Senator Andrew Bartlett as leader of the Australian Democrats, after an incident at Parliament House. Bartlett had earlier in the evening stolen five bottles of wine from a Liberal Party Christmas function, which Ferris had sent staff to retrieve. At around 10:30 pm Ferris confronted Bartlett, who was drunk. Bartlett approached Ferris on the floor of the Senate chamber, allegedly grabbing her arm and calling her a \"fucking bitch\". He then supposedly followed her out of the chamber while verbally abusing her. The next morning Bartlett apologised in writing to Ferris, although she considered the inclusion of a bottle of wine with Bartlett's letter of apology \"quite inappropriate ... as an apology for drunken behaviour involving abuse and a physical attack.\"\n\nFerris was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in October 2005 and succumbed to the disease in Canberra, on 2 April 2007. She was survived by two sons, Robert and Jeremy. Her former husband, Bob Ferris, with whom she maintained a close friendship since their divorce in the 1980s, was killed in a road accident three days later on 5 April 2007.\n\nFollowing Jeannie's death, a DVD produced by Kay Stammers with support from the Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing was dedicated in her memory.\n\nSimon Birmingham was appointed on 3 May 2007 to fill the casual vacancy created by Jeannie Ferris's death.

{"id": "2148329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2148329", "title": "Mathematical universe hypothesis", "text": "Mathematical universe hypothesis\n\nIn physics and cosmology, the mathematical universe hypothesis (MUH), also known as the ultimate ensemble theory, is a speculative \"theory of everything\" (TOE) proposed by cosmologist Max Tegmark.\n\nTegmark's MUH is: \"Our external physical reality is a mathematical structure\". That is, the physical universe is not merely \"described by\" mathematics, but \"is\" mathematics (specifically, a mathematical structure). Mathematical existence equals physical existence, and all structures that exist mathematically exist physically as well. Observers, including humans, are \"self-aware substructures (SASs)\". In any mathematical structure complex enough to contain such substructures, they \"will subjectively perceive themselves as existing in a physically 'real' world\".\n\nThe theory can be considered a form of Pythagoreanism or Platonism in that it proposes the existence of mathematical entities; a form of mathematical monism in that it denies that anything exists except mathematical objects; and a formal expression of ontic structural realism.\n\nTegmark claims that the hypothesis has no free parameters and is not observationally ruled out. Thus, he reasons, it is preferred over other theories-of-everything by Occam's Razor. Tegmark also considers augmenting the MUH with a second assumption, the computable universe hypothesis (CUH), which says that the mathematical structure that is our external physical reality is defined by computable functions.\n\nThe MUH is related to Tegmark's categorization of four levels of the multiverse. This categorization posits a nested hierarchy of increasing diversity, with worlds corresponding to different sets of initial conditions (level 1), physical constants (level 2), quantum branches (level 3), and altogether different equations or mathematical structures (level 4).\n\nAndreas Albrecht of Imperial College in London, called it a \"provocative\" solution to one of the central problems facing physics. Although he \"wouldn't dare\" go so far as to say he believes it, he noted that \"it's actually quite difficult to construct a theory where everything we see is all there is\".\n\nJürgen Schmidhuber argues that \"Although Tegmark suggests that '... all mathematical structures are a priori given equal statistical weight,' there is no way of assigning equal non-vanishing probability to all (infinitely many) mathematical structures.\" Schmidhuber puts forward a more restricted ensemble which admits only universe representations describable by constructive mathematics, that is, computer programs; e.g., the Global Digital Mathematics Library and Digital Library of Mathematical Functions, linked open data representations of formalized fundamental theorems intended to serve as building blocks for additional mathematical results. He explicitly includes universe representations describable by non-halting programs whose output bits converge after finite time, although the convergence time itself may not be predictable by a halting program, due to the undecidability of the halting problem.\n\nIn response, Tegmark notes (sec. V.E) that a constructive mathematics formalized measure of free parameter variations of physical dimensions, constants, and laws over all universes has not yet been constructed for the string theory landscape either, so this should not be regarded as a \"show-stopper\".\n\nIt has also been suggested that the MUH is inconsistent with Gödel's incompleteness theorem. In a three-way debate between Tegmark and fellow physicists Piet Hut and Mark Alford, the \"secularist\" (Alford) states that \"the methods allowed by formalists cannot prove all the theorems in a sufficiently powerful system... The idea that math is 'out there' is incompatible with the idea that it consists of formal systems.\"\n\nTegmark's response in (sec VI.A.1) is to offer a new hypothesis \"that only Gödel-complete (fully decidable) mathematical structures have physical existence. This drastically shrinks the Level IV multiverse, essentially placing an upper limit on complexity, and may have the attractive side effect of explaining the relative simplicity of our universe.\" Tegmark goes on to note that although conventional theories in physics are Gödel-undecidable, the actual mathematical structure describing our world could still be Gödel-complete, and \"could in principle contain observers capable of thinking about Gödel-incomplete mathematics, just as finite-state digital computers can prove certain theorems about Gödel-incomplete formal systems like Peano arithmetic.\" In (sec. VII) he gives a more detailed response, proposing as an alternative to MUH the more restricted \"Computable Universe Hypothesis\" (CUH) which only includes mathematical structures that are simple enough that Gödel's theorem does not require them to contain any undecidable or uncomputable theorems. Tegmark admits that this approach faces \"serious challenges\", including (a) it excludes much of the mathematical landscape; (b) the measure on the space of allowed theories may itself be uncomputable; and (c) \"virtually all historically successful theories of physics violate the CUH\".\n\nStoeger, Ellis, and Kircher (sec. 7) note that in a true multiverse theory, \"the universes are then completely disjoint and nothing that happens in any one of them is causally linked to what happens in any other one. This lack of any causal connection in such multiverses really places them beyond any scientific support\". Ellis (p29) specifically criticizes the MUH, stating that an infinite ensemble of completely disconnected universes is \"completely untestable, despite hopeful remarks sometimes made, see, e.g., Tegmark (1998).\"\nTegmark maintains that MUH is testable, stating that it predicts (a) that \"physics research will uncover mathematical regularities in nature\", and (b) by assuming that we occupy a typical member of the multiverse of mathematical structures, one could \"start testing multiverse predictions by assessing how typical our universe is\" ( sec. VIII.C).\n\nThe MUH is based on the Radical Platonist view that math is an external reality ( sec V.C). However, Jannes argues that \"mathematics is at least in part a human construction\", on the basis that if it is an external reality, then it should be found in some other animals as well: \"Tegmark argues that, if we want to give a complete description of reality, then we will need a language independent of us humans, understandable for non-human sentient entities, such as aliens and future supercomputers\". Brian Greene ( p. 299) argues similarly: \"The deepest description of the universe should not require concepts whose meaning relies on human experience or interpretation. Reality transcends our existence and so shouldn't, in any fundamental way, depend on ideas of our making.\"\n\nHowever, there are many non-human entities, plenty of which are intelligent, and many of which can apprehend, memorise, compare and even approximately add numerical quantities. Several animals have also passed the mirror test of self-consciousness. But a few surprising examples of mathematical abstraction notwithstanding (for example, chimpanzees can be trained to carry out symbolic addition with digits, or the report of a parrot understanding a “zero-like concept”), all examples of animal intelligence with respect to mathematics are limited to basic counting abilities. He adds, \"non-human intelligent beings should exist that understand the language of advanced mathematics. However, none of the non-human intelligent beings that we know of confirm the status of (advanced) mathematics as an objective language.\" In the paper \"On Math, Matter and Mind\" the secularist viewpoint examined argues (sec. VI.A) that math is evolving over time, there is \"no reason to think it is converging to a definite structure, with fixed questions and established ways to address them\", and also that \"The Radical Platonist position is just another metaphysical theory like solipsism... In the end the metaphysics just demands that we use a different language for saying what we already knew.\" Tegmark responds (sec VI.A.1) that \"The notion of a mathematical structure is rigorously defined in any book on Model Theory\", and that non-human mathematics would only differ from our own \"because we are uncovering a different part of what is in fact a consistent and unified picture, so math is converging in this sense.\" In his 2014 book on the MUH, Tegmark argues that the resolution is not that we invent the language of mathematics, but that we discover the structure of mathematics.\n\nDon Page has argued (sec 4) that \"At the ultimate level, there can be only one world and, if mathematical structures are broad enough to include all possible worlds or at least our own, there must be one unique mathematical structure that describes ultimate reality. So I think it is logical nonsense to talk of Level 4 in the sense of the co-existence of all mathematical structures.\" This means there can only be one mathematical corpus. Tegmark responds ( sec. V.E) that \"this is less inconsistent with Level IV than it may sound, since many mathematical structures decompose into unrelated substructures, and separate ones can be unified.\"\n\nAlexander Vilenkin comments (Ch. 19, p. 203) that \"the number of mathematical structures increases with increasing complexity, suggesting that 'typical' structures should be horrendously large and cumbersome.

He goes on to note (footnote 8, p. 222) that Tegmark's solution to this problem, the assigning of lower \"weights\" to the more complex structures ( sec.

He hosted WKBW-TV's \"Eyewitness News\" in Buffalo, New York, for 34 years, from 1964 to 1998, becoming an iconic broadcaster well known in both the Buffalo area and in Southern Ontario, which was within WKBW's broadcast area. Weinstein was known for his powerful delivery and sense of humor. Weinstein, weatherman Tom Jolls and sports anchor Rick Azar fronted the broadcast from 1965 until Azar's retirement in 1989. Weinstein was inducted into the Buffalo Broadcasters Hall of Fame in 1998 and the N.Y. State Broadcasters Association in 2006.\n\nBorn in Rochester, New York, to Jewish emigrants from Lithuania, Weinstein began his broadcast career while he was in high school, working at WHAM Radio as an actor on several locally produced programs under the tutelage of Bill Hanrahan. He was paid $7 a day for his work on WHAM, in which Weinstein, whose voice was already mature by the age of 15, would often play the roles of adults. Weinstein's work on WHAM eventually led to a single national radio appearance, as a one-scene character on \"The Aldrich Family\", for which he was paid $230, an unusually high sum for the day. He initially hoped to pursue an acting career, but a conversation with Robert Mitchum, who warned Weinstein of a shortage of opportunities in the entertainment industry, convinced Weinstein to attend broadcasting school in New York City instead.\n\nAfter sending out hundreds of resumes and barely getting any responses, he began his professional career at KWWL-TV in Waterloo, Iowa (which lasted only a few months) and various stations in West Virginia, in-between working low-end jobs and nearly giving up before his wife convinced him not to accept a job with the United States Postal Service. In West Virginia, he took the pseudonym \"Mark Roberts\" and was influenced by the styles of Paul Harvey. He was hired as a newscaster at WKBW Radio in Buffalo in 1958, a role he chose to be closer to his hometown; initially working under Art Wander, Weinstein eventually became news director. His fast-paced style featured strong writing and alliteration (\"pistol-packing punks\" referring to petty criminals, or \"Buffalo blaze busters\" in place of firefighters), and it was here where he began referring to himself as \"Irv.\"\n\nIn 1964, Weinstein was hired as news director and anchorman at sister station WKBW-TV, an ABC Network affiliate. At the time, the station's news programs were rated #3 in a three-station market. By 1974, WKBW-TV's Eyewitness News program had an audience larger than the combined audience of the two competing Buffalo stations. It remained the top-rated newscast until Weinstein's retirement in 1998 and beyond. Weinstein's innovations would later be adapted by Mel Kampmann for the national \"Action News\" franchise.\n\nIn 1968, Weinstein briefly returned to his broadcast beginnings as an actor in WKBW radio's Halloween adaptation of Orson Welles' \"War of the Worlds\". Weinstein also appeared in a 1971 remake, which was re-run in 1998. During his 40-year career in Buffalo, Weinstein appeared in numerous stage productions and, in the early 1980s, co-owned The Playhouse, a legit theater in downtown Buffalo.\n\nA WKBW-TV promo for Eyewitness News included a jingle:\n\nThe day of his retirement, December 31, 1998, was proclaimed \"Irv Weinstein Day in Erie County\" by then-Erie County Executive Dennis Gorski. Five days later, Toronto columnist David Frum wrote a tribute titled \"He came from Buffalo\" in Canada's \"National Post\" newspaper, writing, \"The way the French feel about Jerry Lewis, that's how we feel about Irv Weinstein\". In October 2004, Weinstein's status as \"an icon of television journalism in Buffalo\" was discussed on the floor of the Ontario Legislature by MPP Tim Hudak. Weinstein was considered a quintessential part of Buffalo culture during his time with WKBW and beyond.\n\nWeinstein, who shifted away from the sensationalist approach toward the end of his career, explained that the reason he reported on arson so much compared to, for example, Toronto, was a practical one: Toronto had most of its wood structures burnt down in the 1904 Great Fire of Toronto, while Buffalo still had a large stock of wood-frame houses, and thus there were indeed more fires in Buffalo than in Toronto.\n\nWeinstein was known for using alliteration in his reporting. Either he or WNEW-TV's Mel Epstein coined the phrase \"It's 11:00. Do you know where your children are?,\" a public service announcement now used on numerous other U.S. stations. The phrase \"topping tonight's Eyewitness News\" continues to be used to open WKBW's newscasts to the present day.\n\n\nWeinstein and his wife Elaine spent most of their retirement in Irvine, California; they also maintained a second home in Ellicottville, New York until a few years before he died. Irv and Elaine Weinstein were married from 1955 until his death. Their daughter, Beth Krom, served two terms as mayor of Irvine and now serves on the City Council. The Weinsteins' son, Marc, is co-owner of Amoeba Music, and their younger daughter, Rachel Lloyd, is an artist and theater administrator in the Pittsburgh area.\n\nIn summer 2016, Weinstein was diagnosed with amyotropic lateral sclerosis, after first experiencing symptoms of the disease in March. With the diagnosis, Weinstein relocated to an assisted living facility in Mission Viejo, California, where he would spend the end of his life. As of November 2016, he could no longer walk but still had full function of his arms and torso and was in good mental condition; he was given a prognosis of five years to live and could still speak (with some audible difficulty as the disease also affected his breathing). By April 2017, Weinstein was no longer able to speak and communicated solely by typing. Weinstein died in Mission Viejo on December 26, 2017, aged 87, from complications of the disease.\n\n"}

The screenplay by Michael Seitzman was inspired by the 2002 book \"Class Action: The Story of Lois Jenson and the Landmark Case That Changed Sexual Harassment Law\" by Clara Bingham and Laura Leedy Gansler, which chronicled the case of \"Jenson v. Eveleth Taconite Company\".\n\nIn 1989, Josey Aimes flees from her abusive husband back to her hometown in northern Minnesota with her children, Sammy and Karen, and moves in with her parents, Alice and Hank. Hank is ashamed of Josey, who had Sammy as a teenager by an unknown father, and believes Josey is promiscuous. While working a job washing hair, Josey reconnects with an old acquaintance, Glory Dodge, who works at the local iron mine and suggests Josey do the same, as a job there pays six times more than what Josey's making now. Josey's pursuit of the job further strains her relationship with Hank, who also works at the mine and believes women shouldn't be working there, so she and her children move in with Glory and her husband, Kyle.\n\nJosey quickly befriends several other female workers at the mine and soon realizes the women are constant targets for sexual harassment and humiliation by most of their male co-workers, who, like Hank, believe the women are taking jobs more appropriate for men. Josey in particular is targeted by Bobby Sharp, her ex-boyfriend from high school. Josey tries to talk to her supervisor, Arlen Pavich, about the problem, but he refuses to take her concerns seriously. The women experience additional harassment and even abuse in retaliation, and Bobby spreads rumors that Josey attempted to seduce him, leading his wife to publicly berate and humiliate Josey at Sammy's hockey game. Sammy begins to resent the way the townspeople treat them and comes to believe the gossip about his mother's alleged promiscuity.\n\nJosey takes her concerns to the mine's owner, Don Pearson, but despite his previous assurances that he is there to help, she arrives to find that he has invited Pavich to the meeting, along with several other executives and offers to accept her resignation immediately. She refuses, and after Pearson implies he believes the rumors about her promiscuity, leaves devastated. Later, after being sexually assaulted by Bobby at work, she quits and asks Bill White, a lawyer friend of Kyle and Glory, to help her file a lawsuit against the company. Bill advises her to recruit other women to form a class action lawsuit, which would be the first of its kind. The female miners, however, fear losing their jobs and facing additional harassment, so Josey attempts to go ahead with the case alone. She also discovers that Glory has Lou Gehrig's Disease, and her health is declining rapidly.\n\nAlice and Hank argue over Josey's lawsuit, and when Hank still refuses to forgive his daughter, Alice leaves him. At a union meeting, Josey attempts to address the miners and explain her reasons for suing the mine, but they constantly interrupt and insult her, leading Hank to stand up for his daughter and reprimand his co-workers for their treatment of Josey and all the women at the mine. He and Alice then reconcile. In court, the mining company's attorney attempts to hold Josey's sexual history against her, based on Bobby's testimony that Sammy is the result of a consensual sexual relationship between Josey and her high school teacher, Paul Lattavansky. Josey then reveals that after school one day, where she and Bobby had been serving detention together after being caught kissing, she was raped by Lattavansky, which led to her becoming pregnant with Sammy. Hank attacks the teacher in question and Bill gets a recess after Josey storms out of the courtroom.\n\nSammy still refuses to believe his mother and runs away, until Kyle urges him to reconsider, and he and Josey embrace after having a talk.\n\nBill cross-examines Bobby and gets him to admit he witnessed Paul rape Josey, but was too scared to do anything about it. Glory, who has come to the court in her wheelchair and is unable to speak, has Kyle read a letter saying she stands with Josey, though still not enough to qualify for a class action suit. After a pause, many other women stand, followed by family members and even several male miners who didn't harass the female ones. The mining company is forced to pay the women for their suffering and establish a landmark sexual harassment policy at the workplace.\n\nLois Jenson, on whom the character of Josey is based, actually began working at the EVTAC (from \"Eveleth Taconite\") mine in Eveleth, Minnesota, in 1975 and initiated her lawsuit in 1984, four years before the year in which the film begins. Its timeline was condensed, but in reality it took fourteen years for the case to be settled. Jenson declined to sell the rights to her story or act as the film's consultant.\n\nThe character Glory Dodge, played by Frances McDormand, was based on Pat Kosmach, one of the plaintiffs in the class action suit. Kosmach died partway through the case, on November 7, 1994. Eveleth Mines settled four years later, in December 1998, paying fifteen women a total of $3.5 million.\n\nThe film was shot in the northern Minnesota towns of Eveleth, Virginia, Chisholm, and Hibbing; Minneapolis; as well as Silver City and Santa Fe in New Mexico.\n\n\nSongs in the film that weren't in the soundtrack release include \"Wasn't That a Party\" by The Irish Rovers, \"Shake the House Down\" by Molly Hatchet and karaoke versions of George Thorogood's \"I Drink Alone\" and Pat Benatar's \"Hit Me with Your Best Shot.\"\n\nThe film premiered at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival and was shown at the Chicago International Film Festival before going into theatrical release in the US, where it grossed $6,422,455 in its opening weekend, ranking 5th at the box office. Budgeted at $30 million, it eventually grossed $18,337,722 in the US and $6,873,453 in foreign markets for a total worldwide box office of $25,211,175.\n\nOn the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 69% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 162 reviews, with Theron and McDormand receiving critical acclaim for their performances. The site's consensus states: \"Though sometimes melodramatic and formulaic, \"North Country\" is nonetheless a rousing, powerful story of courage and humanity.\" On Metacritic, the film has an average score of 68 out of 100, based on 39 reviews.\n\nManohla Dargis of the \"New York Times\" called it \"a star vehicle with heart – an old-fashioned liberal weepie about truth and justice\" and added, \"[It] is one of those Hollywood entertainments that strive to tell a hard, bitter story with as much uplift as possible. That the film works as well as it does, delivering a tough first hour only to disintegrate like a wet newspaper, testifies to the skill of the filmmakers as well as to the constraints brought on them by an industry that insists on slapping a pretty bow on even the foulest truth.\"\n\nIn his review in the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", Roger Ebert observed, \"\"North Country\" is one of those movies that stir you up and make you mad, because it dramatizes practices you've heard about but never really visualized. We remember that Frances McDormand played a woman police officer in this same area in \"Fargo\", and we value that memory, because it provides a foundation for Josey Aimes. McDormand's role in this movie is different and much sadder, but brings the same pluck and common sense to the screen. Put these two women together (as actors and characters) and they can accomplish just about anything. Watching them do it is a great movie experience.\"\n\nRuthe Stein of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" called the film a \"compelling if occasionally unnecessarily convoluted movie . . . The first 15 minutes or so are a mess . . . Fortunately, [it] calms down and becomes extremely engrossing, especially in the courtroom battles . . . it's all carefully calculated for dramatic effect and succeeds brilliantly in drawing you in and eliciting tears in the process . . . \"North Country\" would have benefited from crisper editing. It runs at least 15 minutes longer than necessary . . . For all its flaws, [it] delivers an emotional wallop and a couple of performances worthy of recognition come award time.\"\n\nIn \"Rolling Stone\", Peter Travers awarded the film two out of a possible four stars and commented, \"Any similarities between Josey and Lois Jenson, the real woman who made Eveleth Mines pay for their sins in a landmark 1988 class-action suit, are purely coincidental. Instead, we get a TV-movie fantasy of female empowerment glazed with soap-opera theatrics. The actors, director Niki Caro (\"Whale Rider\") and the great cinematographer Chris Menges all labor to make things look authentic. But a crock is a crock, despite the ferocity and feeling Theron brings to the role . . . Though the dirt and grime in \"North Country\" are artfully applied, it's purely cosmetic and skin-deep.\"\n\nIn \"Stories from North Country,\" a documentary accompanying the film on the DVD, Lois Jenson, on whom the story is based, said, \"I think it's important for people to see this.\" Regarding Charlize Theron, Jenson said, \"She has the character. [...] She knew the part. She knew what it needed – the depth she needed to go to. She's done a great job with it.\"\n\nDavid Rooney of \"Variety\" said, \"[It] indulges in movie-ish manipulation in its climactic courtroom scenes. But it remains an emotionally potent story told with great dignity, to which women especially will respond . . . The film represents a confident next step for lead Charlize Theron. Though the challenges of following a career-redefining Oscar role have stymied actresses, Theron segues from \"Monster\" to a performance in many ways more accomplished . . . The strength of both the performance and character anchor the film firmly in the tradition of other dramas about working-class women leading the fight over industrial workplace issues, such as \"Norma Rae\" or \"Silkwood\".\"\n\nIn the \"St. Petersburg Times\", Steve Persall graded the film A and called it \"deeply, undeniably moving . . . crusader cinema at its finest.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2148373", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2148373", "title": "Dance/Mix Show Airplay", "text": "Dance/Mix Show Airplay\n\nDance/Mix Show Airplay (formerly Hot Dance Airplay) is a monitored electronic dance music radio chart that is featured weekly in \"Billboard\" magazine.\n\nThe chart came about as a result of the small but influential impact of electronic dance music on the radio in the United States and the stations that program it. At the start, this spinoff of the Dance Club Songs chart was openly available through \"Billboard\", \"Billboard Radio Monitor\" and \"R&R\" from its 2003 inception to 2008, when it became exclusive-only to \"Billboard\", up until the chart was renamed in 2011, when it made its playlist available for viewing on \"BDS Radio\"'s website. A modified version was added to \"Billboard\"'s website in January 2013, featuring 15 songs. This would be expanded to 25 (later to 40) after \"Billboard\" revamped its website in January 2015, along with adding an archive section that allows its readers to research the songs, artists, and their peak positions since its inception.\n\nWhen \"Billboard\" updated its website in August 2018, the entire chart entries and positions dating from the August 16 to October 18, 2003 issues were officially added as a acknowledgement to reflect its entire history. The unpublished chart included 40 titles to reflect tracks that had airplay spins among Dance outlets, some of them previous reporters from the Rhythmic or Mainstream Top 40 panels (the original six stations that made up the panel had all switched formats); a sample from the September 20, 2003 chart featured songs that charted during this period include those that had previously run on other \"Billboard\" charts after it had ended its run (\"Dance With My Father\" by Luther Vandross; \"Gotta Get Thru This\" by Daniel Bedingfield; and \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" by Kylie Minogue), recently released Dance/EDM singles (\"Satisfaction\" by Benny Benassi Presents The Biz; \"Gates of Mind\" by Sterbinszky & Tranzident Featuring Jewl; \"It Just Won't Do\" by Tim Deluxe featuring Sam Obernik) and certain Hip-Hop tracks (50 Cent's \"P.I.M.P.\"). The chart would be reduced to 25 titles in the October 4, 2003 issue, removing the non-Dance titles with the exception of those that had been remixed for Dance radio.\n\nIts first number-one in the inaugural issue at the time it was unpublished was \"Crazy In Love\" by Beyonce featuring Jay Z, which spent seven weeks at the top, followed by \"Never (Past Tense)\" by Roc Project featuring Tina Arena in the October 4, 2003 issue. After \"Billboard\" made the chart official on October 17, 2003, \"Just the Way You Are\" by Milky became the official number one single in its October 25, 2003 published issue, even though it had been number one for three weeks, having topped it the week ending October 11 (2003).\n\nIn the issue dated November 19, 2011, the chart's name and methodology was changed. Director of charts Keith Caulfield explained in his \"Over the Counter\" column: \"Effective this week, \"Billboard\"'s Dance Airplay chart is renamed Dance/Mix Show Airplay, as its source of data is widely expanded. Formerly a ranking based on airplay at six dance-formatted reporters (four terrestrial radio stations, plus SiriusXM's BPM channel and Music Choice's Dance/Electronica channel) the plays-based list expands to include mixshow plays on mainstream top 40 and select rhythmic stations that have submitted their hours of mixshow programming, as monitored by Nielsen BDS, to \"Billboard\".\"\n\nOn November 26, 2014, the 25-song chart expanded back to 40 positions after eleven years (effective with the December 6, 2014 issue), allowing more dance singles to chart while simultaneously making the chart less pop-oriented.\n\nIn comparison to other dance charts, American commercial radio's definition of dance music is arguably far more marginal, which is reflected in the chart's content. After the alterations made in 2011, the chart somewhat moved away from its initial purpose of charting conventional dance songs, instead including more remixed pop and urban songs in place of traditional forms of dance music and/or music by dance artists. By 2012, however, the influx of EDM songs in mix shows and the addition of two additional dance outlets amongst those monitored once again increased the dance content found on the chart, thereby decreasing to some extent the number of remixed pop and R&B tracks featured.\n\nThere are 40 positions on this chart and it is solely based on radio airplay. Eight stations (five terrestrial, one cable, one satellite and one online internet service), serve as exclusive reporters and are electronically monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week by Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems. Songs are ranked by a calculation of the total number of spins per week with its \"audience impression\", which is based upon exact times of airplay and each station's Nielsen Audio listener data. The chart also includes 84 selected Mainstream, Adult, and Rhythmic Top 40 reporters that features mix shows as part of their programming, which in turn also contributes to the Radio Songs chart as a semi-component to the Mainstream Top 40 chart. Dance/Mix Show Airplay makes up part of the main Dance/Electronic Songs chart, which was launched with January 26, 2013 issue.\n\nSongs receiving the greatest growth will receive a \"bullet\", although there are tracks that will also get bullets if the loss in detections doesn't exceed the percentage of downtime from a monitored station. \"Airpower\" awards are issued to songs that appear on the top 20 of both the airplay and audience chart for the first time, while the \"greatest gainer\" award is given to song with the largest increase in detections. A song with six or more spins in its first week is awarded an \"airplay add\". If a song is tied for the most spins in the same week, the one with the biggest increase that previous week will rank higher, but if both songs show the same amount of spins regardless of detection the song that is being played at more stations is ranked higher. Songs that fall below the top 15 and have been on the chart after 26 weeks are removed and go to the 20-song recurrent status.\n\nWith the exception of Madonna, David Guetta, Kaskade, Calvin Harris, and The Chainsmokers, all of whom crossed over to Pop from Dance and continue to be core Dance artists, the artists in the following lists are Pop and/or Rhythmic acts; the songs that landed them on the Dance chart were generally remixes of the original recordings. Rihanna and Katy Perry, however, has been more successful at both Dance Club Songs and Dance/Mix Show Airplay, where Madonna leads with 49 number ones at the former, seven of those on this chart, followed by Rihanna with 33 (9 on this chart) and Perry with 19 (including 4 on this chart) while achieving success at Pop and Rhythmic. Guetta is the only male artist to see 8 of his 14 Dance Club Songs number ones also reach number one at Dance/Mix Show Airplay, while Britney Spears, Clean Bandit, Sam Smith, Coldplay, Daft Punk, Halsey, Harris, Dua Lipa, Zedd, Rihanna, Ellie Goulding, Khalid, and Marshmello can lay claim to being the only artists to place number ones at Dance Club Songs, Dance/Electronic Songs, and Dance/Mix Show Airplay.\n\nAs of 2019, Calvin Harris and Rihanna have accumulated the most chart toppers, with twelve number ones apiece. Rihanna was also the youngest artist on this chart to reach number one with \"Pon de Replay\" in 2005, when she was 16, while Harris leads among male artists. Madonna is the only artist on this chart to see seven singles all reach number one consecutively, making her the only artist on this chart to accomplish this feat, and also has the most number-ones from one album, all four singles from \"Confessions on a Dance Floor\" topped the chart (Although she is now tied with Katy Perry, as her four singles from \"Teenage Dream\" have reached the top spot). In addition, Madonna was also named the number-one Dance Airplay artist for the decade (2003–2009) in \"Billboard\"'s decade-end recap in 2009. The Chainsmokers have the most number ones among duo or groups with 7, followed by Cascada and AnnaGrace, who are tied with 3. However, AnnaGrace are the only duo or group to score their first consecutive number ones on this chart, while The Chainsmokers can claim the most weeks at number one, with 48.\n\nCalvin Harris and Rihanna shared 14 weeks with \"We Found Love\" and twelve with \"This Is What You Came For,\" but Harris has logged the most weeks on the chart as his nine other singles have spent 10 or more weeks at number one.\n\nThis list features artists who have reached the top ten, even if they didn't reach number one, since the launch of the chart in 2003. As of 2019, David Guetta leads with 26 top ten singles. Guetta, in part due to being a producer and DJ/remixer, has the most charted singles that feature guest vocalists that perform on his songs. Additionally, Rihanna, who now ranks second and leads among females, also share a top ten song together here, \"Who's That Chick?\" (number 7 in January 2011).

It can be treated with behavioral therapy and anti-anxiety medication. The term comes from the , \"álgos\", \"pain\" and , \"phóbos\", \"fear\".\n\nAccording to Sabino Metta, a behavioral psychologist, the phobic reaction is a learned behavior. A common example of this would be an elderly person who hears about all of their friends suffering from various ailments and pains. This person will begin to anticipate the problems and experience the results before anything actually happens to them. People suffering from this probably have hyperalgesia.\n\nThe Fear of Pain Questionnaire (currently the FPQ-III), a mental health screening tool, has been used to test for algophobia in the past and was found to have good internal consistency and test-retest reliability.\n\n"}

Several of their songs would later become The Stalin songs, such as \"Ideologist\", \"Niku\" and their versions of \"No Fun\" and \"Light My Fire\".\n\nIn June 1980 Endo formed The Stalin. He chose the name because \"Joseph Stalin is very hated by most people in Japan, so it is very good for our image.\" Originally a three piece with Endo on vocals and bass, Atsushi on guitar and Jun on drums. Shintaro joined as bassist later in the month, however their first single, \"Dendou Kokeshi\", was already recorded without him and was released on September 5, 1980. On April 7, 1981, they released the \"Stalinism\" EP. In July Tam replaced Atsushi on guitar. On November 4, at a live performance at Kanto Gakuin High School, Endo is arrested for indecent exposure. On December 24, 1981, they released their first full-length album, the half studio/half live, \"Trash\".\n\nThe Stalin were one of the bands to star in Sogo Ishii's movie \"Burst City\", released on March 13, 1982. Their concert on June 24 was the last with drummer Jun, however he still appears on their major label debut album \"Stop Jap\", as well as their first major label single \"Romantist\", both released on July 1, as they were recorded before he left. \"Romantist\" is a reworked version of \"Ideologist\" from \"Trash\", and has become their most well-known song worldwide. Hitoshi joins as drummer in July 1982. Sogo Ishii also directed a promotional video for \"Romantist\", as well as \"Stop Jap\" and their next single \"Allergy\", which was released on August 25. Their concert on September 27, 1982, was the last with Hitoshi. In November Keigo joins on drums, but leaves in December along with Tam.\n\nIn January 1983, Makoto joins on guitar and Tatsuya on drums. On February 10, they released their fourth single \"Go Go Stalin\". Their next album \"Mushi\" and single \"Nothing\", are both released on April 25. After a June 11 gig, Makoto and Tatsuya leave. Also in June 1983 Shintaro leaves. At a concert on September 17, Teruya and former member Jun, play as guest support on guitar and drums respectively.\n\nIn early 1984, June-Bleed joins as guitarist. But on March 17, 1984, he leaves and is eventually replaced by Masahiro. Also in March, Jun rejoins the band on drums and Teruya joins as bassist. In May, their song \"Chicken Farm\" appeared on MRR's international \"Welcome to 1984\" compilation. The concert on June 3 was the last with Masahiro and Teruya. Also in June Hiroshi would become support bassist, never officially joining. Masayuki joined on guitar in August 1984. Their last album \"Fish Inn\" was released on November 20. After their concert on December 29, Endo announced \"This is the end of The Stalin\". Although their true last concert was held on February 21, 1985 at Chofu Daiei Studio and was entitled \"I was the Stalin\". The show was recorded and released, on both VHS, \"Last Live - Zessan Kaisan Naka!!\", and double LP, \"For Never - Last Live\", on May 25, 1985.\n\nIn May 1987, Endo created Video Stalin, a group of musicians who were more of a video production group than a band. They released three videos and one album. One of the videos, \"Your Order! The History of The Stalin\", can be considered a The Stalin video instead, as it is composed almost entirely of live footage and promo clips throughout The Stalin's career. They disbanded in 1988.\n\nInspired by the monumental events of 1988, especially the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Endo revived The Stalin with new members and a new name, now simply Stalin. He had been fascinated with the Polish Solidarity movement, which began the same year as The Stalin, and after a visit to Warsaw he organized a Japanese tour for the Polish punk band Dezerter. Stalin completed the cultural exchange in 1990 when they toured Eastern Europe, which was recorded and released as the \"Saigo no Akai Natsu -Stalin Call in East Europe-\" video. They had a couple line-up changes and released six singles, four studio albums and one live album, before calling it quits in 1993.\n\nOn February 8, 2001 there was a special The Stalin concert entitled \"One Night Dream\". Michiro Endo performed with Keigo Nakata (ex:The Stalin) on drums, Shinichi Suzuki (Pulling Teeth) on guitar and Katsuta on bass. Other bands and artists also performed and paid tribute to the group, including Loopus, Cobra, Panta and Kenzi. The show was recorded and released as the \"Hakike Gasuruhodo Romanchikku Daze!!\" video on June 30, 2001. The concert coincided with the release of the \"365 - A Tribute to The Stalin\" album, which has some of the bands that performed covering The Stalin songs.\n\nOn December 1, 2010 two tribute albums were released. One entitled \"Romantist - The Stalin, Michiro Endo Tribute Album\", features bands such as Buck-Tick, Dir en grey, Group Tamashii and Jun Togawa covering The Stalin and Michiro Endo songs. The other \"Red Demon, Blue Demon - Michiro Endo 60th Birthday Anniversary Tribute Album\", features different artists and was first released at Endo's concert on November 14 to coincide with his 60th birthday.\n\nEndo still gathered various musicians for occasional The Stalin performances. The last being a few shows in early 2011 as \"The Stalin Z\", with the line-up of Endo on vocals, Tatsuya Nakamura (ex:The Stalin) on drums, KenKen (Rize) on bass and Kazuhiro Hyaku (Mo'Some Tonebender) on guitar.\n\nMichiro Endo died in a Tokyo hospital while battling pancreatic cancer on April 25, 2019, aged 68.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2148428", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2148428", "title": "Fear of needles", "text": "Fear of needles\n\nFear of needles, known in medical literature as needle phobia, is the extreme fear of medical procedures involving injections or hypodermic needles.\n\nIt is occasionally referred to as \"aichmophobia\", although this term may also refer to a more general fear of sharply pointed objects. Since the mid-2000s, it has also been referred to as \"trypanophobia\", although the origin and proper usage of that term is highly controversial.\n\nThe condition was officially recognized in 1994 in the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition) as a specific phobia of blood-injection-injury type phobia. Phobic level responses to injections cause sufferers to avoid inoculations, blood tests, and in the more severe cases, all medical care.\n\nIt is estimated that at least 10% of American adults have a fear of needles, and it is likely that the actual number is larger, as the most severe cases are never documented due to the tendency of the sufferer to avoid all medical treatment.\n\nAccording to Dr. James G. Hamilton, author of the pioneering paper on needle phobia, it is likely that the form of needle phobia that is genetic has some basis in evolution, given that thousands of years ago humans who meticulously avoided stab wounds and other incidences of pierced flesh would have a greater chance of survival.\n\nThe discussion of the evolutionary basis of needle phobia in Hamilton's review article concerns the vasovagal type of needle phobia, which is a sub-type of blood-injection-injury type phobia. This type of needle phobia is uniquely characterized by a two-phase vasovagal response. First, there is a brief acceleration of heart rate and blood pressure. This is followed by a rapid plunge in both heart rate and blood pressure, sometimes leading to unconsciousness. The loss of consciousness is sometimes accompanied by convulsions and numerous rapid changes in the levels of many different hormones.\n\nOther medical journal articles have discussed additional aspects of this possible link between vasovagal syncope and evolutionary fitness in blood-injection-injury phobias.\n\nAn evolutionary psychology theory that explains the association to vasovagal syncope is that some forms of fainting are non-verbal signals that developed in response to increased inter-group aggression during the paleolithic. A non-combatant who has fainted signals that they are not a threat. This might explain the association between fainting and stimuli such as bloodletting and injuries.\n\nAlthough needle phobia is defined simply as an extreme fear of medically related shots/injections, it appears in several varieties.\n\nAlthough most specific phobias stem from the individuals themselves, the most common type of needle phobia, affecting 50% of those afflicted, is an inherited vasovagal reflex reaction. Approximately 80% of people with a fear of needles report that a relative within the first degree exhibits the same disorder.\n\nPeople who suffer from vasovagal needle phobia fear the sight, thought, or feeling of needles or needle-like objects. The primary symptom of vasovagal fear is vasovagal syncope, or fainting due to a decrease of blood pressure.\n\nMany people who suffer from fainting during needle procedures report no conscious fear of the needle procedure itself, but a great fear of the vasovagal syncope reaction. A study in the medical journal \"Circulation\" concluded that in many patients with this condition (as well as patients with the broader range of blood/injury phobias), an initial episode of vasovagal syncope during a needle procedure may be the primary cause of needle phobia rather than any basic fear of needles. These findings reverse the more commonly held beliefs about the cause-and-effect pattern of needle phobics with vasovagal syncope.\n\nThe physiological changes associated with this type of phobia also include feeling faint, sweating, nausea, pallor, tinnitus, panic attacks, and initially high blood pressure and heart rate followed by a plunge in both at the moment of injection.\n\nAlthough most phobias are dangerous to some degree, needle phobia is one of the few that actually kill. In cases of severe phobia, the drop in blood pressure caused by the vasovagal shock reflex may cause death. In Hamilton's 1995 review article on needle phobia, he was able to document 23 deaths as a direct result of vasovagal shock during a needle procedure.\n\nThe best treatment strategy for this type of needle phobia has historically been desensitization or the progressive exposure of the patient to gradually more frightening stimuli, allowing them to become desensitized to the stimulus that triggers the phobic response.  In recent years, a technique known as \"applied tension\" has become increasingly accepted as an often effective means for maintaining blood pressure to avoid the unpleasant, and sometimes dangerous, aspects of the vasovagal reaction.\n\nAssociative fear of needles is the second most common type, affecting 30% of needle phobics. This type is the classic specific phobia in which a traumatic event such as an extremely painful medical procedure or witnessing a family member or friend undergo such, causes the patient to associate all procedures involving needles with the original negative experience.\n\nThis form of fear of needles causes symptoms that are primarily psychological in nature, such as extreme unexplained anxiety, insomnia, preoccupation with the coming procedure, and panic attacks. Effective treatments include cognitive therapy, hypnosis, and/or the administration of anti-anxiety medication.\n\nResistive fear of needles occurs when the underlying fear involves not simply needles or injections but also being controlled or restrained. It typically stems from repressive upbringing or poor handling of prior needle procedures (for example, forced physical or emotional restraint).\n\nThis form of needle phobia affects around 20% of those afflicted. Symptoms include combativeness, high heart rate coupled with extremely high blood pressure, violent resistance, avoidance, and flight. The suggested treatment is psychotherapy, this may include teaching the patient self-injection techniques or finding a trusted health care provider.\n\nHyperalgesic fear of needles is another form that does not have as much to do with fear of the actual needle. Patients with this form have an inherited hypersensitivity to pain, or hyperalgesia. To them, the pain of an injection is unbearably great and many cannot understand how anyone can tolerate such procedures.\n\nThis form of fear of needles affects approximately 10% of people with needle phobia. The symptoms include extreme explained anxiety, and elevated blood pressure and heart rate at the immediate point of needle penetration or seconds before. The recommended forms of treatment include some form of anesthesia, either topical or general.\n\nWhilst witnessing procedures involving needles it is possible for the phobic to suffer the symptoms of a needle phobic attack without actually being injected. Prompted by the sight of the injection the phobic may exhibit the normal symptoms of vasovagal syncope and fainting or collapse is common. While the cause of this is not known, it may be due to the phobic imagining the procedure being performed on themselves. Recent neuroscience research shows that feeling a pin prick sensation and watching someone else's hand get pricked by a pin activate the same part of the brain.\n\nFear of needles, especially in its more severe forms, is often comorbid with other phobias and psychological ailments; for example, iatrophobia, or an irrational fear of doctors, is often seen in needle phobic patients.\n\nA needle phobic patient does not need to physically be in a doctor's office to experience panic attacks or anxiety brought on by needle phobia. There are many triggers in the outside world that can bring on an attack through association. Some of these are blood, injuries, the sight of the needle physically or on a screen, paper pins, syringes, examination rooms, white lab coats, dentists, nurses, the antiseptic smell associated with offices and hospitals, the sight of a person who physically resembles the patient's regular health care provider, or even reading about the fear.\n\nThe medical literature suggests a number of treatments that have been proven effective for specific cases of needle phobia, but provides very little guidance to predict which treatment may be effective for any specific case. The following are some of the treatments that have been shown to be effective in some specific cases.\n\n\n"}

The f/2.8 versions are popular among event photographers and photojournalists where the lens's lower light capabilities are required. Some portrait photographers also prefer this lens because the fast aperture produces more background blur and bokeh. \n\nThe non-IS f/2.8 version was released in 1995 and replaced the EF 80–200mm f/2.8L. The lenses use nine- or eight-bladed, circular diaphragms which maintain a nearly circular aperture when stopped down. The f/2.8 and f/4.0 image-stabilized versions also feature weather sealing when mated to a weather-sealed camera to such as the Canon EOS 1D-series bodies. These lenses are compatible with the Canon Extender EF teleconverters. Due to its internal zooming mechanism, the lens does not creep or zoom when pointed downward.\n\nWhen used with a Canon APS-C (1.6x crop) DSLR camera or APS-H (1.3x crop), the 35-mm-equivalent focal lengths of these lenses are 112–320mm on an APS-C sensor and 91–260mm on an APS-H sensor. This is due to the crop factor inherent with APS-C or APS-H (crop) sensor digital SLR cameras.\n\nA frequently pointed-out problem with this lens is the placement of the IS and AF switches, which make them prone to accidental flipping during hand-held shooting. Some photographers solve this by covering the buttons with a piece of gaffer tape. In recognition of this issue, starting with the f/4L IS USM model and f/2.8L IS II USM lens, Canon uses switches designed to reduce the incidence of accidental switch activation.\n\n"}

The men's 1st team competes in the , the seventh tier of English football.\n\nIn 1889, Nuneaton St. Nicholas FC was the first team in Nuneaton to play senior football. In 1894, the 'Nicks' changed their name to Nuneaton Town Association Football Club, which they played under until 1937 when the club was disbanded. Two days later, the club was reformed as Nuneaton Borough F.C. and played under this name until 2008 when the club was liquidated due to poor financial performance. It was renamed Nuneaton Town and suffered a two-division demotion. During the 2018–19 season the club reverted to its former name Nuneaton Borough F.C. after overwhelming support for the change from supporters. \n\nThe club currently plays its home fixtures at Liberty Way, Nuneaton. The club's home colours are blue and white, which are usually represented as vertical stripes. The club is known to some supporters as 'The Boro'.\n\nLocal rivals include Tamworth, Leamington and Bedworth United.\n\nThe club began in 1889 when young men from Nuneaton St. Nicolas Parish Church formed a football team to represent the town. Originally playing only friendly games, in September 1894 the 'Nicks’ changed their name to Nuneaton Town Association F.C.\n\n\n\"League:\"\n\n\"Cup:\"\n\nIn 1936 the club sold its Manor Park ground to Nuneaton Corporation. On 13 May 1937, at an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders, it was decided to shut down the football club despite it being financially sound.\n\nFollowing the disbanding of the club a new group of young Gentlemen decided to reform it two days later. The club played at a new ground, Manor Park (1937-2007) and Liberty Way (2007-2008). The club nickname became established as 'The Boro'.\n\n\n\"League\"\n\n\"Cup\"\n\n\nIn March 1983, George Best played for Nuneaton Borough in a friendly match against Coventry City and scored from a penalty.\n\nIn May 2007, the club left its Manor Park ground after drawing its last game 1–1 against Vauxhall Motors.\n\nIn the 2007–08 season, ill-health meant the club's owner Ted Stocker decided to sell his shares. In March 2008, local businessman Ian Neale took ownership of the club for a trial period. He eventually took 100% ownership of the club in April of that year, but in May Neale found irregularities in the club finances, raising fears that the club would be forced into administration. On 2 June 2008, Nuneaton Borough went into liquidation.\n\nThe club was once again reformed, but the FA insisted that it revert to its former name of Nuneaton Town. Falling foul of financial regulations the club was demoted two divisions, from Conference North to Southern League Division One, although the club was promoted back to its former division over the following two seasons.The club continued to be known by its former nickname, \"The Boro\"\n\nOn 30 April 2018, it was announced the club would be renamed Nuneaton Borough F.C. and it was officially renamed on 16 June 2018.\n\n\n\"League\"\n\n\"Cup\"\n\n\nThe club was relegated to the Southern League Midlands Division in the 2008–2009 season but made an immediate return to the Southern League Premier Division the following season with a 1–0 play-off final victory over Chasetown at Liberty Way.\n\nIn the Southern League Premier Division, Nuneaton found themselves facing several teams that were chasing promotion. After a slow start, the team went on a run that saw them beaten once at home and included a run of 14 straight victories. A 24-point gap between the leaders Farnborough was narrowed to two points at the end of the season. Nuneaton had some success in the FA Cup and FA Trophy but ended the second week in March with a backlog of eight games in hand over their top-six rivals. Nuneaton pursued Farnborough and had a schedule of ten games in twenty-four days, including two games in twenty-four hours.\n\nA 6–0 defeat of Brackley Town in the semi-final saw home advantage given to Nuneaton who faced Chippenham. The final went into extra time and local player Eddie Nisevic scored the winning goal, returning Nuneaton to the Conference North. Three days after the play-off final, Nuneaton beat Alvechurch to win the Birmingham Senior Cup. Only Premier League club Aston Villa has won the cup more times than Nuneaton, which has won the trophy in every decade since the Second World War.\n\nNuneaton returned to the Blue Square Bet North and the opening game and crowd average was around 1,000. Nuneaton started well and remained in the top six up until Christmas, where they gained top spot until the last week in March. After other clubs played their games in hand, Nuneaton finished just outside the play-offs but the club above them, Eastwood Town, were prevented from taking part in the playoffs due to a technical problem. Nuneaton faced Telford United in the first leg and led until the 93rd minute when the away side drew level. In the second tie, Telford took the lead but defended for the second half. Nuneaton lost to Telford, which was eventually promoted into the Football Conference.\n\nThe 2011–12 season saw Nuneaton gain promotion back to the Conference Premier for the first time in 10 years. After maintaining a high league position throughout the season, in its last few weeks an administrative error led to a six-point deduction but a final day 3–2 victory at Blyth Spartans ensured their play-off place. A semi-final 2nd-leg victory over Guiseley with a goal from Andy Brown in the last minute of extra time meant that Boro had to travel to Gainsborough Trinity for the Play-Off Final. Again Brown scored the goal that saw Boro claim a 1–0 victory. The club's promotion was its third in four seasons since the reformation.\n\nThe 2012–13 season saw Nuneaton play against the country's non-league elite. Despite spending much of the season in and around the relegation zone a run towards the end of the season saw the club finish in 15th place.\n\nThe 2013–14 season, Nuneaton led the table early on and in and around the play-offs for most of the season. Following manager Kevin Wilkin's departure for Wrexham, results tailed off in the last month but they finished in 13th position. A new manager, Brian Reid, was appointed and oversaw the last three games of the season.\n\nThe 2014–15 season saw Lee Thorn invest in the club, becoming chairman. His investment allowed the club to regain ownership of the stadium.\nOn 8 September, following a poor start to the 2014–15 season, Reid was let go following a number of poor results and performances. Liam Daish was appointed manager but the club was relegated to the newly renamed National League North.\n\nThe 2015–16 pre-season saw Lee Thorn taking full control of the club and Kevin Wilson named as manager.\n\nNuneaton Town first entered the FA Cup in 1899 but never progressed to the competition proper. Nuneaton Borough has achieved this twenty-one times, including victories over Football League sides Watford, Swansea City (twice), Oxford United and most recently Stoke City.\n\nNuneaton Borough have progressed to the FA Cup Third Round Proper in 1949–50, 1966–67 and 2005–06. For their 1966–67 run, crowd of 22,114 was in attendance at the Manor Park ground on 28 January 1967 when Rotherham United were held to a draw in a Third Round tie. Rotherham beat Boro 1–0 at Millmoor in the rematch.\n\nMiddlesbrough visited Manor Park on 7 January 2006, and could only achieve a 1–1 draw with Nuneaton, Gez Murphy scoring an equalising penalty in the 90th minute to the delight of the home crowd, earning Nuneaton a replay against a Premier League side approximately 100 places above them. Middlesbrough won the replay at the Riverside Stadium 5–2. Gez Murphy scored twice in this fixture, therefore scoring 3 goals against Middlesbrough over the two games.\n\nOther giant killings of note came against Stoke City in 2000, Marc McGregor with a 90th-minute winner, and in 1993 a win over Swansea City, with Tony Simpson netting both goals.\n\nThe club made its first appearance in the FA Cup first round in its current guise of Nuneaton Town, on 7 November 2009 when they entertained Exeter City. This was also the first time that Liberty Way had hosted a game in the FA Cup competition proper. The game ended with Exeter City winning 4–0. In 2010 they also reached the first round of the Cup with an away tie against Lincoln City, but were once again beaten from an 89th-minute strike leaving the score at 1–0. They reached the first round proper once again on 3 November 2012 facing Luton Town and forcing a replay after a 1–1 draw. However, on 13 November they lost the replay 2–0.\n\nFull league and cup records can be found on the club website at http://www.nuneatontownfc.com/a/historical-league-cup-records-36618.html\n\nNuneaton Borough's best run has seen them reach the quarter-final three times: In 1977 (a replay), in 1980 and 1987.\nThey endured an awful run in the competition between 1995 and 2006 however. In this time they did not win a single FA Trophy game. In 2006 the run ended with a win at Bradford Park Avenue.\nThe previous win was in 1995 at Spennymoor United.\n\nThe Boro won the Birmingham Senior Cup for the first time in 1931 and have won it a total of nine times since, most recently in 2010.\n\nThe club played on various fields from 1889 to 1903 located at Higham Lane, Rose Inn (Coton Road), Arbury Road (later renamed Queens Road) and Edward Street. The turn of the century saw the Boro moved to enclosed grounds at Queens Road 1903–08, Newdigate Arms 1908–15 and then Manor Park.\n\nFrom the club's early years until 2007 Boro played at Manor Park; a 6,000 capacity stadium at the time of its closure. The record attendance was 22,114 spectators who had packed into the ground for an FA Cup tie against Rotherham United in 1967.\n\nThe club played their final game at Manor Park, on 28 April 2007, in a 1–1 draw with Vauxhall Motors. Gez Murphy scored Boro's last goal at the ground from the penalty spot.\n\nThe stadium has now been knocked down and has been redeveloped for housing by former shirt sponsors Bloor Homes.\n\nNuneaton Borough moved into its new ground, Liberty Way, in time for the 2007–08 season. The ground was initially owned and purpose-built by Nuneaton Rugby Club, which now shares the ground. As a consequence of the decision to move, the ground was substantially upgraded. The upgrade took place over three phases by local building firm Ian Neale Construction (owned by future owner Ian Neale) and was completed in 2007.\n\nThe move to Liberty Way was not straightforward. Originally the club planned to move from Manor Park to the new ground for the 2005–06 season but ended up having to wait 2 seasons before work was completed. Also, the club hit a snag over the covenant protecting Manor Park which was eventually cleared, allowing the club could move to Liberty Way. The ground-share plan with Nuneaton R.F.C. was planned by the then owner Ted Stocker of both clubs, after many new ground plans across Nuneaton were rejected by the local council. As a consequence of the ground share, ownership of the ground passed from the rugby club to a new holding company, \"Stadiasafe.\"\n\nThe ground share with Nuneaton Rugby Club ('The Nuns') effectively died with the liquidation of Stadiasafe, leaving no formal agreement in place between the two clubs. Having gained sole ownership of the ground, Nuneaton Town Football Club put a deal on the table that would allow the rugby club to play inside the stadium in return for a realistic rate. Under the old agreement, the rugby club paid £35 to hire the pitch, a fee that also covered the use of the floodlights and markings. Since this was previously paid to a sister company (the aforementioned Stadiasafe; owned by the owner of both clubs), the amount paid was immaterial. However, when the football club gained sole ownership, this sparked disagreements over the amount to be paid to the football club by the rugby club to play its games in the stadium.\n\nAt the start of the 2010–11 season, a deal was struck with the Nuns where the rugby club was able to play several games per season inside the stadium.\n\nThe club completed a permanent seated stand for 514 supporters on the north side of the stadium, which has improved the stadium in line with the standards required for participation in the Conference Premier. They have also outlined plans to extend this stand by adding a further 500 or so seats in the future. Facilities ancillary to football and the club's community initiatives will be housed in a two-storey building behind the new stand, adjacent to the remembrance garden for families of the people who had their ashes scattered at Manor Park.\n\nIn March 2013 Liberty Way underwent ground improvements to meet new regulations, turnstiles, changing rooms and the players' tunnel were all upgraded.\n\nIn July 2013 it was announced that the stadium would be known as the \"Sperrin Brewery Stadium\" for the 2013–14 season after a local family run business won the naming rights in a golden ticket draw. For the 2014–15 season, following the second 'golden ticket draw', the ground was named the \"JDRF James Parnell Stadium\".\n\nOn 12 February 2019, chairman Nick Hawkins stepped down after just three-months at the club.\n\nBoro currently have four players who have been loaned to other teams\nClub Secretary Adam Etheridge\n\n5 players have scored over 100 competitive goals for the club;\n\nBrendon Phillips 1997–2000 <br>\nSteve Burr 2000–2003 <br>\nAlan Lewer 2003–2004 <br>\nRoger Ashby 2004–2006 <br>\nKevin Wilkin 2006–2014 <br>\nBrian Reid 2014 <br>\nLiam Daish 2014–2015 <br>\nKevin Wilson 2015–2016 <br>\nTommy Wright 2016–2017 <br>\nDino Maamria 2017–2018 <br>\nGary Charles 2018 <br>\nNicky Eaden 2018 <br>\nLee Fowler 2018 <br>\nJimmy Ginnelly 2018–\n\nBelow are the ten most recent Nuneaton Town seasons.\n\n\n\n1.

Trinity is a non-profit organization with more than 150 physicians and is the largest employer in Minot.\n\nTrinity's facilities include two acute care hospitals, several clinics, and a 292-bed long-term care and retirement facility. Trinity has been designated as a Level II trauma center.\n\nDuring the early 1920s, Lutheran pastors from across the Northwest Territory gathered in Minot, ND, to sketch out plans for a hospital.\n\nIn 1922, the Trinity Hospital Association was formed and within weeks ground was broken for a 30-bed hospital unit, the first of four such units to be constructed over the course of a decade.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Trinity Hospital merged with the Lutheran Home to form Trinity Medical Center. In the early 1990s, Trinity formed its own physician services department – Trinity Medical Group.\n\nOn January 1, 1999, Trinity Medical Center changed its name to Trinity Health.\n\nIn 1999, the Trinity CancerCare Center was built adjacent to Health Center-Town & Country.\n\nOn May 3, 2001, Trinity Health merged with UniMed Medical Center, Medical Arts Clinic and Kenmare Community Hospital under the banner of Trinity Health.\n\nIn January 2009, it opened its CancerCare Cottage, a building which accommodations for cancer patients and their caregivers while they are receiving treatment at Trinity Health's CancerCare Center.\n\nIn April 2008, it was reportedly considering building a medical park. In January 2009, it bought of land southwest Minot for a new hospital and medical park. On October 31, 2016, Trinity officially sought rezoning of the land for the expansion from agricultural to general commercial usage. In November 2016, it was reported that Trinity planned to offer $430 million in bonds to fund their expansion and to pay off previously issued bonds. In January 2017, Trinity chose TEG Architects of Jeffersonville, Indiana to design and coordinate the construction of their new expansion.\n\nIn March 2014, Cerner settled a legal dispute with Trinity Health over allegations of defective financial software with a settlement of $106 million.\n\nIn August 2013, patients receiving contracted blood work and podiatry services from Trinity contracted Hepatitis C.

Austin High School, more commonly known as Austin High, is a public high school in Austin, Texas, United States, and part of the Austin Independent School District (AISD). Founded in 1881, it is one of the oldest public high schools west of the Mississippi River, and was the one of the first public high schools in the state of Texas.\n\nThe campus is located near Downtown Austin along the Colorado River (Lady Bird Lake). The school, originally known simply as Austin High School, was renamed in 1953 after Stephen F. Austin, locally revered as the \"Father of Texas\". It is one of eleven high schools in the Austin Independent School District.\n\nRoughly 2,500 students attend the school in grades nine through twelve. The school's current building is its third, following four 19th-century and 20th-century locations in other buildings.\n\nAustin High's official motto is \"Mens Agitat Molem\" () or, \"Mind Over Matter\". The official mascot is Mr. Maroo.\n\nThe school received a level of notoriety when the film Dazed and Confused was released in 1993, loosely based on Austin High.\n\nAustin High School opened in September 1881, with classes held on the third floor of the West Austin School building at 11th Street and Rio Grande Street. Due to population growth, instruction was held at the First Baptist Church, the temporary State Capitol, and the Smith Opera House. The first Austin High School campus, located at 9th Street and Trinity Street, opened in 1900. In 1925, Austin High School moved to 1212 Rio Grande Street, the former building of John T. Allan Junior High School ( 1916), which had relocated to 9th at Trinity.\n\nIn 1956, the first seven African-American students began attending Austin High School as part of desegregation; a total of 13 black students attended white high schools in AISD at that time.\n\nIn 1975, Austin High School moved to its current building, designed by Jay W. Barnes II. The first classes at the Cesar Chavez campus commenced on August 25, 1975.\n\nThe Mr. Maroo mascot was officially adopted by the student council in the 1965–66 school year.\n\nThe current campus is bounded by Lady Bird Lake (formerly Town Lake) on one side and a freeway on the other. Because of the school's relative isolation and the campus's relative newness, Amy Wells, author of \"Both Sides Now: The Story of School Desegregation’s Graduates\", wrote that the school \"has a somewhat suburban feel\".\n\nAs of the late 1970s the school was considered to be the best in its area, according to Wells. It was known for having a university preparatory curriculum.\n\nAustin High was called a National Blue Ribbon School in 1982–83.\n\nDowntown Austin, the Westcreek Neighborhood and the family apartment complexes of the University of Texas at Austin are zoned to Austin High School. Other Austin High neighborhoods include Zilker, Barton Hills, Travis Country, and Tarrytown.\n\nAustin High School historically had a reputation as an elite school as it was associated with wealthy neighborhoods in the western part of Austin.\n\n the school was 54% non-Hispanic White, 37% Hispanic and Latino, 8% black, and 2% Asian, reflecting the overall demographics of Austin. As of 1980 most of the White students originated from west Austin, including Tarrytown. There were also middle class and poor students. Some black students originated from Clarksville, an area housing servants' quarters that, until school desegregation, was served by segregated black schools. By 1980, court-ordered desegregation added a heavily Hispanic and Latino section of South Austin, and a black section of northeast Austin to the student population.\n\nAs of the late 1970s the school was 66% White, 19% Hispanic, and 15% African-American, making it one of the more racially balanced AISD schools; at the time there was less Hispanic representation and more White representation than the district average. In 1980 the federal court system forced AISD to begin desegregation busing.\n\nAustin High School offers many different athletic programs for students: football, basketball, tennis, golf, mountain biking, swimming, baseball, volleyball, soccer, track and field, cross country, lacrosse, and cheerleading. The Austin High football team won the 1942 state championship.\n\nFormer NFL offensive tackle Mike Rosenthal is the head coach of the school's football team.\n\n\n"}

Its formal name is \"Genden Shédrup Dargyé Trashi Gyésu khyilwé Ling\" ().\n\nLabrang is located in Xiahe County, Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu, in the traditional Tibetan area of Amdo. Labrang Monastery is home to the largest number of monks outside the Tibet Autonomous Region. Xiahe is about four hours by car from the provincial capital Lanzhou.\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, Labrang was by far the largest and most influential monastery in Amdo. It is located on the Daxia River, a tributary of the Yellow River.\n\nThe monastery was founded in 1709 by the first Jamyang Zhépa, Ngawang Tsöndrü. It is Tibetan Buddhism's most important monastery town outside the Tibetan Autonomous Region.\n\nLabrang Monastery is situated at the strategic intersection of two major Asian cultures—Tibetan and Mongolian — and was one of the largest Buddhist monastic universities. In the early 20th century, it housed several thousand monks. Labrang was also a gathering point for numerous annual religious festivals and was the seat of a Tibetan power base that strove to maintain regional autonomy through the shifting alliances and bloody conflicts that took place between 1700 and 1950.\n\nIn April 1985 the Assembly Hall burned down. It was replaced and the new building was consecrated in 1990.\n\nThe monastery complex dominates the western part of the village. The white walls and gilded roofs feature a blend of Tibetan and Indian Vihara architectural styles. The monastery contains 18 halls, six institutes of learning, a gilded stupa, a sutra debate area, and houses nearly 60,000 sutras.\n\nIt has a Buddhist museum with a large collection of Buddha statues, sutras and murals. In addition, a large amount of Tibetan language books, including books on history is available for purchase, together with medicines, calendars, music and art objects.\n\nThere used to be a great gold-painted statue of the Buddha, more than 50 feet high, which was surrounded by rows of surrounding Buddhas in niches.\n\nThe monastery today is an important place for Buddhist ceremonies and activities. From January 4 to 17 and June 26, to July 15, (these dates may change according to the lunar calendar), the great Buddhist ceremony will be held with Buddha-unfolding, sutra enchanting, praying, sutra debates, etc.\n\nThe Hui Muslim Ma clique under Generals Ma Qi and Ma Bufang launched several attacks against Labrang as part of a general anti-Golok Tibetan campaign.\n\nMa Qi occupied Labrang Monastery in 1917, the first time non-Tibetans had seized it. Ma Qi defeated the Tibetan forces with his Hui troops. His forces were praised by foreigners who traveled through Qinghai for their fighting abilities.\n\nAfter ethnic rioting between Hui and Tibetans emerged in 1918, Ma Qi defeated the Tibetans. He heavily taxed the town for 8 years. In 1921, Ma Qi and his Muslim army decisively crushed the Tibetan monks of Labrang Monastery when they tried to oppose him. In 1925, a Tibetan rebellion broke out, with thousands of Tibetans driving out the Hui. Ma Qi responded with 3000 Hui troops, who retook Labrang and machine-gunned thousands of Tibetan monks as they tried to flee. During a 1919 attack by Muslim forces, monks were executed by burning. Bodies were left strewn around Labrang by Hui troops.\n\nMa Qi besieged Labrang numerous times. Tibetans fought against his Hui forces for control of Labrang until Ma Qi gave it up in 1927. However, that was not the last Labrang saw of General Ma. Ma Qi launched a genocidal war against the Goloks in 1928, inflicting a defeat upon them and seizing Labrang Monastery. The Hui forces looted and ravaged the monastery again.\n\nThe Austrian American explorer Joseph Rock encountered the aftermath of one of the Ma clique's campaigns against Labrang. The Ma army left Tibetan skeletons scattered over a wide area and Labrang Monastery was decorated with decapitated Tibetan heads. After the 1929 battle of Xiahe near Labrang, decapitated Tibetan heads were used as ornaments by Hui troops in their camp, 154 in total. Rock described \"young girls and children\"'s heads staked around the military encampment. Ten to fifteen heads were fastened to the saddle of every Muslim cavalryman. The heads were \"strung about the walls of the Moslem garrison like a garland of flowers.\"\n\nIn March 2008 there were protests by monks from Labrang Monastery as well as by other ethnic Tibetans linked to previous protests and rioting that broke out in Lhasa.\n\n\n"}

Hence it is the limiting ratio of successive terms of any (non-zero) integer sequence satisfying this recurrence such as the Cordonnier numbers (better known as the Padovan sequence), the Perrin numbers and the Van der Laan numbers, and bears relationships to these sequences akin to the relationships of the golden ratio to the second-order Fibonacci and Lucas numbers, akin to the relationships between the silver ratio and the Pell numbers.\n\nThe plastic number satisfies the nested radical recurrence\n\nBecause the plastic number has the minimal polynomial it is also a solution of the polynomial equation for every polynomial that is a multiple of but not for any other polynomials with integer coefficients. Since the discriminant of its minimal polynomial is −23, its splitting field over rationals is ). This field is also a Hilbert class field of .\n\nThe plastic number is the smallest Pisot–Vijayaraghavan number. Its algebraic conjugates are\nof absolute value ≈ 0.868837 . This value is also because the product of the three roots of the minimal polynomial is 1.\n\nThe plastic number can be written using the hyperbolic cosine () and its inverse:\n\nThere are precisely three ways of partitioning a square into three similar rectangles:\nThe fact that a rectangle of aspect ratio \"ρ\" can be used for dissections of a square into similar rectangles is equivalent to an algebraic property of the number \"ρ\" related to the Routh–Hurwitz theorem: all of its conjugates have positive real part.\n\nDutch architect and Benedictine monk Dom Hans van der Laan gave the name \"plastic number\" () to this number in 1928. In 1924, four years prior to van der Laan's christening of the number's name, French engineer had already discovered the number and referred to it as \"the radiant number\" (). Unlike the names of the golden ratio and silver ratio, the word plastic was not intended by van der Laan to refer to a specific substance, but rather in its adjectival sense, meaning something that can be given a three-dimensional shape. This, according to Richard Padovan, is because the characteristic ratios of the number, 3/4 and 1/7, relate to the limits of human perception in relating one physical size to another. Van der Laan designed the 1967 St. Benedictusberg Abbey church to these plastic number proportions.\n\nThe plastic number is also sometimes called the silver number, a name given to it by Midhat J. Gazalé and subsequently used by Martin Gardner, but that name is more commonly used for the silver ratio , one of the ratios from the family of metallic means first described by Vera W. de Spinadel in 1998.\n\nMartin Gardner has suggested referring to formula_6 as \"high phi\", and Donald Knuth created a special typographic mark for this name, a variant of the Greek letter phi (\"φ\") with its central circle raised, resembling the Georgian letter pari (\"Ⴔ\").\n\n\n"}

The station, whose frequency is 92.3 MHz with an effective radiated power of 100 kW, is licensed to Laplace, Louisiana and serves the greater New Orleans and Baton Rouge metropolitan areas. Its studios are located at the Place St. Charles building in Downtown New Orleans and its transmitter is located in Vacherie, Louisiana.\n\nThe station signed on the air in 1966 as WCKW. During its first 29 years of its existence, its previous formats included country, classic rock, active rock, all-1980s, adult contemporary (including a rebrand from \"The Point\" to \"Lite 92.3\" on November 4, 2003), and adult top 40.\n\n\"Diva 92.3\"\nOn November 18, 2004, WCKW 'unveiled' the \"Diva\" format and changed its call letters to WDVW, playing mostly rhythmic pop, classic Disco and Dance music from the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. From 2005 to 2007, WDVW was also a reporter to the Billboard Magazine Dance/Mix Show Airplay panel.\n\nWhen it debuted with the format, its slogan was \"Music For The Diva In You\", a reference to the female audience it targeted and the high quotient of female artists on its playlist. But despite the name and slogan, it also attracted males as well. In September 2005, they would later change the slogan to \"New Orleans' New #1 Feel Good Station!\" The reason for that was to bring music and normality back to the area after Hurricane Katrina struck. They were also the first radio station in the market to resume regular music programming after the disaster ended.\n\nWDVW was one of two \"Divas\" in Louisiana. Its sister station in Baton Rouge, WCDV (Diva 103.3), was the other, although WDVW can also be heard in that area as well. But on September 18, 2006, WCDV returned to an Adult Contemporary direction, a move that might have made sense due to the overlapping of two \"Divas\" in Baton Rouge, which hurt WCDV ratings wise.\n\"Mix 92.3\"\nOn December 20, 2007, WDVW switched directions to adult top 40 for its second go-round, this time as \"Mix 92.3.\" The station has dropped most of the Dance fare in favor of current Hot AC product, with recurrents from the 1980s and 1990s and a modern-leaning direction. The station never produced impressive ratings, and given New Orleans' reception toward Hot AC/Adult Top 40 in the past, most notably WLTS, this format has never performed well in this market.\n\nOn July 23, 2010, at approximately 2:50 p.m., after playing \"Need You Now\" by Lady Antebellum, the station began stunting with Mardi Gras-themed music. At 4:00 p.m., the station became \"Rock 92-3,\" using the slogan \"New Orleans' Rock Station\", and adopting their current callsign WRKN. The first song on \"Rock 92-3\" was \"Check My Brain\" by Alice in Chains. The move to a rock format was driven by the recent format change of KOBW, which had aired a similar format.\n\nOn January 3, 2014, at 9 a.m., after playing \"No Sleep till Brooklyn\" by The Beastie Boys, WRKN began stunting with a \"Wheel of Formats\", with the launch of a new format on January 6 at 9:23 AM. Like WDVW, it too was not successful ratings-wise, given New Orleans' history with rock formats. At the promised time, the station flipped to country, branded as \"Nash FM 92-3.\" The first song on \"Nash\" was \"Radio\" by Darius Rucker.\n\nOn April 21, 2016, WRKN altered its format, expanding its presence to target the adjacent Baton Rouge market while tweaking its format towards a mix of 1990s and current songs. The new shift comes with a positioning change to “The Gulf South’s Country Giant”. With the change, Scott Innes joined the station for middays. Innes spent fifteen years at WYNK in Baton Rouge prior to his exit in 2011. He also is a cartoon voice actor best known for being the voice of many Hanna Barbera characters including Shaggy, Scooby and Scrappy Doo.\n\nOn June 19, 2017, at Noon, WRKN swapped formats and call signs with WZRH, with WRKN flipping to alternative rock as \"Alt 92.3\" and assuming the WZRH call sign. Simultaneously, WRKN's country format moved to WZRH as \"106.1 Nash FM\".\n"}
{"id": "2148544", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2148544", "title": "Hereditarianism", "text": "Hereditarianism\n\nHereditarianism is the doctrine or school of thought that heredity plays a significant role in determining human nature and character traits, such as intelligence and personality. Hereditarians believe in the power of genetics to explain human character traits and solve human social and political problems. Hereditarians adopt the view that an understanding of human evolution can extend the understanding of human nature. They have avowedly rejected the standard social science model.\n\nBiologists and geneticists predominantly consider human behavior and psychology to derive from the interaction of genes and environment.\n\nTheories opposed to hereditarianism include behaviorism, social determinism and environmental determinism. This disagreement and controversy is part of the nature versus nurture debate. But both are based on the assumption that genes and environment have large independent effects. The dominant view outside psychology among biologists and geneticists is that both of these are gross oversimplifications and that the behavioral/psychological phenotype for human beings is determined by a function of genes and environment which cannot be decomposed into a sum of functions of the two independently. And this especially because human behavior is uniquely plastic compared to that of other animals. The commonly cited heritability, h, is meaningful only in the context of the independent effects model. This model may be a good approximation to the real function given that the range of genomes and the range of environments is sufficiently narrow, e.g., white upper middle class Americans living in Chicago. Ronald C. Bailey argues that hereditarianism is based on five fallacious assumptions. In a 1997 paper, he also wrote that \"...behavior geneticists will continue to be very limited in their ability to partition the effects of genes, the environment, and their covariance and interaction on human behavior and cognitive ability.\"\n\nHereditarianism is sometimes used as a synonym for biological or genetic determinism, though some scholars distinguish the two terms. When distinguished, biological determinism is used to mean that heredity is the only factor. Supporters of hereditarianism reject this sense of biological determinism for most cases. However, in some cases genetic determinism is true; for example, Matt Ridley describes Huntington's disease as \"pure fatalism, undiluted by environmental variability\". In other cases, hereditarians would see no role for genes; for example, the condition of \"\"not knowing a word of Chinese\"\" has nothing to do (directly) with genes. \n\nIn 1949, Nicolas Pastore claimed that hereditarians were more likely to be conservative, that they view social and economic inequality as a natural result of variation in talent and character. Consequently, they explain class and race differences as the result of partly genetic group differences. Pastore contrasted this with the claim that behaviorists were more likely to be liberals or leftists, that they believe economic disadvantage and structural problems in the social order were to blame for group differences.\n\nHowever, the historical correspondence between hereditarianism and conservatism has broken down at least among proponents of hereditarianism. Philosopher Peter Singer describes his vision of a new liberal political view that embraces hereditarianism in his 1999 book, \"A Darwinian Left\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2148553", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2148553", "title": "Viennese coffee house", "text": "Viennese coffee house\n\nThe Viennese coffee house (, ) is a typical institution of Vienna that played an important part in shaping Viennese culture.\n\nSince October 2011 the \"Viennese Coffee House Culture\" is listed as \"Intangible Cultural Heritage\" in the Austrian inventory of the \"National Agency for the Intangible Cultural Heritage\", a part of UNESCO. The Viennese coffee house is described in this inventory as a place, \"where time and space are consumed, but only the coffee is found on the bill.\"\n\nThe social practices, the rituals, the elegance create the very specific atmosphere of the Viennese café. Coffee Houses entice with a wide variety of coffee drinks, international newspapers, and pastry creations. Typical for Viennese Coffee Houses are marble tabletops, Thonet chairs, newspaper tables and interior design details in the style of Historicism. The Austrian writer Stefan Zweig described the Viennese Coffee House as an institution of a special kind, \"actually a sort of democratic club, open to everyone for the price of a cheap cup of coffee, where every guest can sit for hours with this little offering, to talk, write, play cards, receive post, and above all consume an unlimited number of newspapers and journals.\" Zweig in fact attributed a good measure of Vienna's cosmopolitan air to the rich daily diet of current and international information offered in the coffee houses.\n\nIn many classic cafés (for example Café Central and Café Prückel) piano music is played in the evening and social events like literary readings are held. In warmer months, customers can often sit outside in a Schanigarten. Almost all coffee houses provide small food dishes like sausages as well as desserts, cakes and tarts, like Apfelstrudel, Millirahmstrudel, Punschkrapfen and Linzer torte.\n\nUnlike some other café traditions around the world, it is completely normal for a customer to linger alone for hours and study the omnipresent newspaper. Along with coffee, the waiter will serve an obligatory glass of cold tap water and during a long stay will often bring additional water unrequested, with the idea to serve the guest with an exemplary sense of attention.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, leading writers of the time became attached to the atmosphere of Viennese cafés and were frequently seen to meet, exchange and to even write there. Literature composed in cafés is commonly referred to as coffee house literature, the writers thereof as coffee house poets. The famous journal \"Die Fackel\" (\"The Torch\") by Karl Kraus is said to have been written in cafés to a large extent. Other coffee house poets include Arthur Schnitzler, Alfred Polgar, Friedrich Torberg, and Egon Erwin Kisch. Famous writer and poet Peter Altenberg even had his mail delivered to his favorite café, the Café Central.\n\nLegend has it that soldiers of the Polish-Habsburg army, while liberating Vienna from the second Turkish siege in 1683, found a number of sacks with strange beans that they initially thought were camel feed and wanted to burn. The Polish king Jan III Sobieski granted the sacks to one of his officers named Jerzy Franciszek Kulczycki, who started the first coffee house. This story was published by the Catholic Priest Gottfried Uhlich in 1783 in his \"History of the second Turkish Siege\", and he took some liberties. In reality, Kulczycki's coffee house missed being the first by more than a year. A more factual account has been reported by Karl Teply.\n\nAfter some experimentation, the legend goes on, Kulczycki added some sugar and milk, and the Viennese coffee tradition was born. This achievement has been recognized in many modern Viennese coffeehouses by hanging a picture of Kulczycki in the window. Another account is that Kulczycki, having spent two years in Ottoman captivity, knew perfectly well what coffee really was and tricked his superiors into granting him the beans that were considered worthless.\n\nAccording to recent research, Vienna's first coffee house was in fact opened by an Armenian businessman named Johannes Diodato in 1685. 15 years later, four Greek owned coffeehouses had the privilege to serve coffee.\n\nThe new drink was well received, and coffee houses began to pop up rapidly. In the early period, the various drinks had no names, and customers would select the mixtures from a colour-shaded chart.\n\nThe heyday of the coffee house was the turn of the nineteenth century when writers like Peter Altenberg, Alfred Polgar, Egon Friedell, Karl Kraus, Hermann Broch and Friedrich Torberg made them their preferred place of work and pleasure. Many famous artists, scientists, and politicians of the period such as Arthur Schnitzler, Stefan Zweig, Egon Schiele, Gustav Klimt, Adolf Loos, Theodor Herzl, Alfred Adler, and even Leon Trotsky were constant coffee house patrons. In Prague, Budapest, Krakow, and Lviv and other cities of the Austro-Hungarian empire there were also many coffee houses according to the Viennese model.\n\nIn the 1950s, the period of \"coffee house death\" began, as many famous Viennese coffee houses had to close. This was due to the popularity of television and the appearance of modern espresso bars. Nevertheless, many of these classic Viennese coffee houses still exist. A renewed interest in their tradition and tourism have prompted a comeback. Some relatively modern Viennese coffee houses have emerged in North America, such as Julius Meinl Chicago and Kaffeehaus de Châtillon in the greater Seattle area and Cafe Sabarsky in Manhattan.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2148558", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2148558", "title": "Delivery (cricket)", "text": "Delivery (cricket)\n\nA delivery or ball in cricket is a single action of bowling a cricket ball toward the batsman.\n\nDuring play of the game, a member of the fielding team is designated as the bowler, and bowls deliveries toward the batsman. Six legal balls in a row constitutes an over, after which a different member of the fielding side takes over the role of bowler for the next over. The bowler delivers the ball from their end of the pitch toward the batsman standing at the opposite wicket at the other end of the pitch. Bowlers can be either left-handed or right-handed. This approach to their delivery, in addition to their decision of bowling around the wicket (from the sides of the wicket on the bowler's end) or over the wicket, is knowledge of which the umpire and the batsman are to be made aware.\n\nDeliveries can be made by fast bowlers or by spin bowlers. Fast bowlers tend to make the ball either move off the pitch (‘seam’) or move through the air (’swing’), while spinners make the ball ’turn’ either toward a right-handed batsman (as in the case of off spin and left-arm unorthodox spin) or away from him (as in the case of leg spin and left-arm orthodox spin).\n\nThe ball can bounce at different distances from the batsman, this is called the \"length\" of the delivery. It can range from a bouncer (often bouncing as high as the batsman's head) to a yorker (landing at his feet).\n\nThere are many different types of delivery that a bowler can bowl. These deliveries vary by: technique, the hand the bowler bowls with, use of the fingers, use of the seam, how the ball is positioned in the hand, where the ball is pitched on the wicket, the speed of the ball, and the tactical intent of the bowler.\n\n\nThe variations in different types of delivery, as well as variations caused by directing the ball with differing line and length, are key weapons in a bowler's arsenal. Throughout an over, the bowler will choose a sequence of deliveries designed to attack the batsman's concentration and technique, in an effort to get him out.\n\nThe bowler also varies the amount of loop and pace imparted to various deliveries to try to cause the batsman to misjudge and make a mistake. As the crease has a width, the bowler can change the angle from which he delivers to the batsman in an attempt to induce a misjudgement.\n\nUsually, the bowler decides what type of delivery to bowl next, without consultation or even informing any other member of his team. Sometimes, the team captain will offer advice or even issue a direct order regarding what deliveries to bowl, based on his observations of the batsman and the strategic state of the game. Another player who occasionally offers advice to the bowler is the wicket-keeper, since he has a unique view of the batsman and may be able to spot weaknesses of technique.\n\nAnother piece of information important for the bowlers to consider prior to their deliveries is the state of pitch. The pitch is a natural ground and its state is subjected to variation over the course of the cricket, some of which are multi-day events such as test matches. Spinners find an old pitch, one that has been frequently used, more suitable to their deliveries rather than a fresh pitch, one that has not come under use as much such as a pitch at the start of the match.\n\nWhile a bowler, with the use of variations in their delivery aims to target the concentration of batsmen as well as their skill and technique of batting, anticipation of the delivery is crucial for the batsman, as emphasised by Jodi Richardson. Richardson reveals the world class batsman's dilemma while facing fast bowlers, stating that the time between the batsmen's anticipation of the trajectory of the ball and positioning themselves for the appropriate shot can be twice as long as the interval between the ball leaving the bowler's hand and reaching the batsman's crease. Side by side, Richardson alludes to the research undertaken by Dr. Sean Müller in Australia which was partly funded by Cricket Australia's Centre of Excellence. The results of the research demonstrated the importance of anticipation of the delivery for batsmen in cricket. They revealed that experienced batsmen possessed a unique ability which enabled them to adjust their feet as well as their positioning on the crease accordingly based upon their reading of the body language and movements enacted by the bowler prior to the release of the ball. This foresight that batsmen use while on the crease is referred to as 'advance information' by Richardson. Moreover, Müller's research outlined that the presence of this 'advance information' was not as evident among the lesser skilled batsmen in comparison to the experienced ones.\n\nUnderarm or lob bowling was the original cricket delivery style, but had largely died out before the 20th century, although it was used until 1910 by George Simpson-Hayward, and remained a legal delivery type. On 1 February 1981, when Australia was playing New Zealand in a One Day International cricket match, and New Zealand needed six runs to tie the match from the final ball. Greg Chappell, the Australian captain, ordered the bowler (his brother Trevor) to bowl underarm, rolling the ball along the ground to prevent the Number 10 New Zealand batsman (Brian McKechnie) any chance of hitting a six from the last ball to tie the match.\n\nAfter the game, the then Prime Minister of New Zealand, Rob Muldoon, described it as \"the most disgusting incident I can recall in the history of cricket.\" At the time, underarm deliveries were legal, but as a direct result of the incident, underarm bowling was banned in limited overs cricket by the International Cricket Council as \"not within the spirit of the game.\" The 2000 Code of the \"Laws of Cricket\" declares that an underarm delivery is illegal \"unless otherwise agreed before the match\".\n\nA recently retired cricketer who was greatly embroiled in controversy and under scrutiny from critics over his method of executing deliveries was the Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan. Michael Selvey describes the accusations placed on the bowler in relation to his widely disputed bowling action and delivery, stating the Australian prime minister's reference to the Sri Lankan as a 'chucker.' The controversy linked to Muralitharan's delivery emerged in 1995, when the umpire of the test match between Sri Lanka and Australia deemed Muralitharan's delivery as illegal on the suspicion that he was throwing the ball. Selvey acknowledges this as the factor sparking an 'international cricket incident,' with critics and some extremists going as far as insisting on the exclusion of all of the Sri Lankan's accomplishments throughout his career from the records of cricket. However, Suresh Menon takes an adamant stance on the topic of the controversy surrounding the spinner by displaying appreciation for Muralitharan's actions. Menon suggests that investigation into Muralitharan's deliveries led to the revelation of imperfections present in the bowling action and deliveries of the previously considered 'picture-perfect' fast bowler, Glenn McGrath. This was made possible with the usage of technology and its replacement of the earlier system, which Menon refers to as 'the naked eye.' Eventually, it was declared legal for the bowlers to bend their arm fifteen degrees for deliveries in cricket.\n\nA delivery or ball in cricket is analogous to a \"pitch\" in baseball. The word \"ball\" in cricket usage does not imply anything about the accuracy of the delivery, unlike baseball's usage of \"ball\" to indicate a pitch outside the strike zone. The cricket equivalent of a baseball \"ball\" is a wide or a no-ball.\n"}

In 1133, the hill was part of a manor that Henry I gave to a baron called Richard de Balta. During Henry II's reign it was passed to Alexander de Barentyn, the king's butler. The area that was known as Traitors' Hill, may have acquired its current name during the English Civil War in the 17th century. When it was occupied by troops loyal to the English Parliament. A legend states that this was the site from where Guy Fawkes and Robert Catesby, of the Gunpowder Plot on November the 5th 1605, planned to watch the destruction of Parliament.\n\nOver time, plots of land in the manor were sold off for building, particularly in the early 19th century, though the hill remained mainly common land. In 1875 Hampstead Heath was acquired for the people by the Metropolitan Board of Works. Thirteen years later Parliament Hill was purchased for the public for £300,000 and added to Hampstead Heath.\nNevertheless, manorial rights to the land remained in private hands until the mid 20th century when they lapsed under Sir Spencer Pocklington Maryon Wilson, though the titular estate itself was passed on to Shane Gough, 5th Viscount Gough. Until the 1940s, livestock was still reared on the hill to be sold through Smithfields, the London meat market.\n\nThe City of London Corporation has managed Parliament Hill since 1989. Before that it was managed by the GLC and then Camden Council.\n\nIt is administered by the City of London Corporation together with the rest of Hampstead Heath. The Eastern (Highgate) side, including Parliament Hill Lido, is known as Parliament Hill Fields, and a local girls' school, Parliament Hill School, is named after it.\n\nParliament Hill is renowned as a cross-country running venue and hosted the 2009 English National Championships. It is a popular place that is used by walkers, runners and kite flyers. The 2012,2015 and 2018 English National Cross Country Championships were also staged at Parliament Hill.\n\nThe Hill is also used by Hampstead Rugby Club.

Patterson had succeeded Dewhurst as land commissioner in 2002 when Dewhurst was first elected as lieutenant governor. On a night of \"embarrassingly low\" voter turnout (approximately 4% of registered voters), the incumbent finished with only 262,086 votes (34.9 percent), compared to Patrick's 487,829 (65.1 percent).\n\nDewhurst's third term as lieutenant governor ended on January 20, 2015. He currently serves as an advisory board member at the United States Secretary of Energy led by former Governor Rick Perry who was appointed by President Donald Trump in 2017.\n\nDewhurst's father, David Dewhurst Jr., was a World War II pilot of a Martin B-26 Marauder of the 553d Fighter-Bomber Squadron. On D-Day, flying over Cotentin peninsula in the \"Dinah Might\", he led a squadron bombing German positions on Utah Beach. After the war, David Dewhurst Jr. was killed by a drunk driver, leaving behind his wife and his two sons, David and Eugene. \n\nBoth brothers visited the Utah Beach Museum on June 7, 2007 and discovered an exhibit detailing their father's mission on D-Day. Moved, the Dewhurst brothers contributed millions of dollars for the extension of the museum, allowing it to purchase a B-26 Marauder and to open a new building.\n\nDewhurst is a businessman, a rancher, and a community leader in Houston, where he has served on civic and charitable boards. He graduated from Lamar High School in Houston and earned his bachelor's degree and played basketball at the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona, where he was a brother of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity. There he received a BA in English with a minor in history.\n\nLacking the eyesight to become a pilot like his father, Dewhurst became an intelligence officer in the U.S. Air Force and then an officer of the Central Intelligence Agency, and the United States State Department. During his years in the CIA, Dewhurst was stationed in Bolivia, arriving shortly before the coup against leftist president Juan José Torres.\n\nIn 1981, Dewhurst and Ted Law re-established Falcon Seaboard, a Texas-based diversified energy and investments company in Houston that Law had founded in 1935. The company quickly made Dewhurst a millionaire, but collapsed just as quickly, going into bankruptcy. Dewhurst then went into business constructing cogeneration plants, which proved to be a tremendous success. In 1996, the company sold its plants for $226 million, and in 2011, Dewhurst was worth an estimated $200 million.\n\nIn 1995, Dewhurst married Tammy Jo Hopkins, a 32-year-old model. After she pled no contest to driving while intoxicated in 1999, the couple announced that she would seek full-time help for alcohol abuse. The couple divorced in 2000.\n\nHe breeds registered Black Angus cattle and once competed in National Cutting Horse Association competitions. He also speaks Spanish.\n\nDewhurst was elected as Commissioner of the General Land Office of Texas in 1998, when the 16-year incumbent, Garry Mauro, waged an unsuccessful campaign for governor against George W. Bush. Dewhurst was opposed in the general election by Democratic State Representative Richard Raymond, then of Benavides and thereafter of Laredo. Dewhurst described himself as a \"George Bush Republican\" and drew on his personal wealth to spend a record $8 million on his run for office (previous candidates for land commissioner had generally spent only $1 million). The campaign was a bitter one, in which Dewhurst's Republican primary opponent, Jerry E. Patterson, accused Dewhurst of trying to bribe him to leave the race, and Raymond unsuccessfully accused him of embezzlement. Dewhurst ultimately received 2,072,604 votes (57.42 percent) to Raymond's 1,438,378 ballots (39.85 percent).\n\nDewhurst was elected lieutenant governor in November 2002, when he defeated former Democratic Comptroller John Sharp of Victoria, now the chancellor of Texas A&M University. In that campaign, Dewhurst stressed his interest in public education and opposition to school vouchers. He again outspent his opponent significantly with a $9 million campaign. Dewhurst polled 2,341,875 votes (51.77 percent) to Sharp's 2,082,281 (46.03 percent).\n\nDewhurst succeeded Bill Ratliff. (Ratliff did not contest the lieutenant governor's position in the primary, opting instead for re-election to his state senate seat.)\n\nSummarizing Dewhurst's first term, \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"Amid low expectations, Mr. Dewhurst surprised many that first session, helping to steer a major tort-reform package and cutting the budget while earning the respect of his colleagues as a burgeoning team player.\" However, the paper also noted that he \"frequently frustrated senators from both parties for not appearing to hold firm in negotiations with the House or with [Gov. Rick] Perry.\"\n\nDewhurst was renominated for lieutenant governor in the Republican primary held on March 7, 2006. He defeated Tom Kelly, the same candidate whom he bested for the nomination in 2002. In the November 7, 2006, general election, Dewhurst overwhelmed Democrat Maria Luisa Alvarado, a veterans issues research analyst and the winner of her April 11 runoff primary. He received 2,512,197 votes (58.2 percent) to Alvarado's 1,616,945 (37.4 percent). Libertarian Judy A. Baker polled another 188,956 votes (4.4 percent).\n\nDewhurst filed for Lt. Governor of Texas in the 2010 election. It was widely assumed that he would run for United States Senate if Kay Bailey Hutchison had resigned. He was his party's nominee for a third term as lieutenant governor and faced Democrat Linda Chavez-Thompson, Libertarian Scott Jameson, and Green Party Herb Gonzales, Jr. in the November 2, 2010, general election. He was re-elected to a third term on November 2, 2010, having polled 3,044,770 votes (61.80 percent) to the Democrat Linda Chavez-Thompson's 1,715,735 votes (34.82 percent) and took office on January 18, 2011 for a third four-year term, becoming the second Texas Lieutenant Governor to be elected to three four-year terms since Bill Hobby, who held the office for 18 years for five terms.\n\nDewhurst and Patrick faced each other in the May 27 runoff election for lieutenant governor. The winner would eventually run in the general election against Democratic State Senator Leticia Van de Putte of San Antonio, who is the Democratic nominee for the lieutenant governorship. During the runoff, Dewhurst released a disco-themed advertisement Lt. Gov. You've Gotta Love and a parody of Let It Go from the Disney film \"Frozen\". On May 27, 2014, Patrick easily defeated Dewhurst in a landslide: 65% to 35%.\n\nPatrick said after state Senator Wendy Davis of Fort Worth (who was the Democratic nominee for governor) filibustered the bill to ban late-term abortions in Texas that Dewhurst has \"lost his grip on the reins of the Senate\". Patrick called for new leadership in the chamber.\n\nPolling by the University of Texas at Austin and \"The Texas Tribune\" had showed Dewhurst leading his opponents in the primary with 26 percent of the vote, to Patrick's 13 percent, Patterson's 10 percent and Staples' 5 percent. At the time, 46 percent of voters were reported as undecided.\n\nPrior to the runoff election against Patrick, Dewhurst joined Governor Rick Perry in calling for a \"surge operation\" beginning September 1, 2014, of aircraft and boats on the Mexican border to thwart smuggling and crimes by the drug cartel. House Speaker Joe Straus eventually committed to the surge and is currently underway, affirming Dewhurst's claim from an earlier debate with Patrick, in which he claimed to have Straus' support for the coming surge. The Texas Department of Public Safety still retains the authority to send troopers and equipment to the border without approval from the legislature if the director sees fit to do so.\n\nIn 2003, Dewhurst assisted the Republican leadership, including then U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, Texas House Speaker Tom Craddick, and Governor Rick Perry, in passing a sweeping congressional redistricting bill that increased the number of Republican U.S. House seats in Texas from fifteen to twenty-one in the 2004 elections. The Republican seats dropped to nineteen in the 2006 elections under a modified court redistricting plan. Minority Democrats retain thirteen U.S. House seats from Texas. \n\nIn his capacity as the presiding officer of the Texas Senate, Dewhurst, in the third consecutive special session called by the governor, allowed the suspension of the custom that two thirds of the body must vote to consider a bill.\n\nDewhurst's leadership on redistricting brought him into legal conflict with his former land commissioner opponent, Richard Raymond, the only elected official to have been a plaintiff in the 2006 U.S. Supreme Court review of the constitutionality of the redistricting plan. Dewhurst and Raymond have also sparred over education policy.\n\nHe is known by his \"Texas Children First\" initiative with more severe consequences for child sexual predators in Texas and throughout the United States. The initiative includes extending statute of limitations on child sex crimes and leading the passage of Jessica's Law. The bill was signed into law by Texas Governor Rick Perry but the death penalty for second-time child rapists was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nDewhurst was accused by state senator Dan Patrick of helping to stop a bill, the passage of which would have been an attempt to make the pat downs of airplane passengers by personnel of the U.S. Transportation Security Agency (TSA) a felony in Texas.\n\nIn March 2010, a student performance of the play \"Corpus Christi\" by Terrence McNally, in which Jesus and the disciples are portrayed as being gay, was canceled at Tarleton State University in Stephenville, Texas following a condemnatory statement by Dewhurst. The university had received many complaints about the play's scheduled performance as a class project for a directing class, but in a letter posted on the university's website on March 11, President F. Dominic Dottavio, citing freedom of speech, declared that the play would be performed. The day before the performance, Dewhurst issued his statement saying, \"No one should have the right to use government funds or institutions to portray acts that are morally reprehensible to the vast majority of Americans,\" and the performance was cancelled by the professor, who cited safety concerns. A subsequent statement by Dewhurst praised the university for canceling the performance, whereas the professor claimed to have acted on his own. Dewhurst's statement also claimed that whereas he is \"a strong defender of free speech, we must also protect the rights and reasonable expectations of Texas taxpayers and how their money is used. A play that is completely contrary to the standards of decency and moral beliefs of the vast majority of Texans should not be performed using any state resources, especially by an institution of higher learning.\"\n\nIn an August 3 recording, originally released by police to the Dallas-Fort Worth NBC affiliate, NBC-DFW, Dewhurst identifies himself as the lieutenant governor and asks to speak to the police station's \"most senior police officer you have where you are right now\". He tells a police sergeant that Ellen Bevers, his stepsister's daughter-in-law, is a schoolteacher and \"the sweetest woman in the world\", and says he's sure she has been incarcerated on a \"mistaken charge\".\n\nOn July 18, 2011, Dewhurst addressed his supporters in an online video on his campaign website, announcing his candidacy for the vacant U.S. Senate seat for the Republican nomination. His rivals included former Mayor of Dallas Tom Leppert, ESPN college football analyst Craig James and former state Solicitor General Ted Cruz, the eventual nominee.\n\nAfter a year-long campaign for the Republican nomination, Dewhurst lost to Cruz in a run-off on July 31, 2012. Cruz then won the seat in the general election against Democrat Paul Sadler of Henderson.\n\n"}

It was discovered following a search for drugs with structures similar to brompheniramine (it is a derivative of brompheniramine), an antihistamine with antidepressant activity. Zimelidine was first sold in 1982.\n\nWhile zimelidine had a very favorable safety profile, within a year and a half of its introduction, rare case reports of Guillain–Barré syndrome emerged that appeared to be caused by the drug, prompting its manufacturer to withdraw it from the market. After its withdrawal, it was succeeded by fluvoxamine and fluoxetine (derived from the antihistamine diphenhydramine) in that order, and the other SSRIs.\n\nThe mode of action is a strong reuptake inhibition of serotonin from the synaptic cleft.

It won the Tennessee Aeronautics Commission's \"Airport of the Year\" award in 2003. The airport does not provide scheduled commercial service. However, charter service is provided by Aviation Specialists, Inc., a private company located at the airport, that offers flight instruction and a banner towing operation.\n\nThis airport is assigned a three-letter location identifier of FGU by the Federal Aviation Administration, but it does not have an International Air Transport Association (IATA) airport code (the IATA assigned FGU to Fangatau Airport in French Polynesia).\n\nBegun as a flying club in 1965 by pilot and mechanic John Linn and Ellsworth McKee—son of the founders of the McKee Foods Corporation, the Collegedale Airport was originally a grass strip on a farm. It was purchased by pilot-entrepreneur Aubrey Kinzer in 1969 and turned into a commercial venture with a flight school, rental aircraft, and aircraft maintenance. In 1972, the City of Collegedale obtained the property, and over the years the asphalt paved runway has been extended to 4,700 feet (1400 m) from its nominal 3,500-foot (1150 m) length and widened to 75 feet (23 m) with a parallel taxiway. In 1995, the airport was rededicated and renamed Linn Field in honor of John Linn. Renovations and additions to the terminal, lobby, and Fixed-Base Operations (FBO) office were completed in 2003.\n\nCollegedale Municipal Airport covers an area of 145 acres (59 ha) at an elevation of 860 feet (262 m) above mean sea level.

Born in Shanghai, she was a highly ranked player in China before she moved to Singapore with her husband, Singaporean table tennis player Loy Soo Han, whom she married in 1992. She represented Singapore in sporting events starting in the 1990s, and was naturalized as a Singaporean citizen in 1994. After retiring as a player, she served as deputy head coach, then as head coach, of the women's national table tennis team, before being reassigned to leading the country's table tennis youth development program in late 2015.\n\nJing Junhong was born in Shanghai, China on 13 October 1968, the child of a teacher and an engineer. Jing was trained in table tennis in China after being spotted at the age of eight, and by 1988 she had become the nation's third ranked women's table tennis player. That year, she met Singaporean table tennis player Loy Soo Han, who was attending a long-term training program. Jing and Loy were married in 1992, and Jing moved to Singapore that year, with the intention of retiring from table tennis. She became a naturalized citizen of Singapore in 1994. In 1998, she had a son, Meng Huen (Darren), who as of 2012 was also training to represent Singapore in table tennis.\n\nBy 1992, Jing was representing Singapore at international table tennis competitions. Her first event representing Singapore was that year's Vietnam Golden Racket Championships, which she won. The following year, Jing was selected to represent Singapore at the 1993 World Table Tennis Championships in Gothenburg, Sweden. At the event, she beat then top ranked player and Olympic champion Deng Yaping of China. In 1995, Jing represented Singapore at the Commonwealth Table Tennis Championships, where she took second behind Hong Kong's Chai Po Wa, and at the 1995 Southeast Asian Games. At the Southeast Asian Games, she won the singles and mixed doubles events, and came in second in the women's doubles event.\n\nJing represented Singapore in the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, where she competed in the Women's singles event. She swept her group, winning all three of her matches (against Kim Hyang-Mi, Xu Jing, and Petra Cada), but exited in the round of 16 after losing to China's Qiao Hong. For her Olympic performance, one of the best to that point in Singapore's history, Jing was named 1997 Sportswoman of the Year. The following year, Jing again competed in the Commonwealth Table Tennis Championships, winning the single, double, and team events, and earning a second consecutive Sportswoman of the Year award. She continued collecting medals in the following years, taking a singles title at the 1997 Southeast Asian Games and two doubles and a team title at the 1999 Southeast Asian Games.\n\nIn the 2000 Summer Olympics, Jing competed in both the singles and doubles events, the latter alongside Li Jiawei. In the singles event, Jing again swept her group, beating Karen Li and Sofija Tepes. She then defeated Sun Jin, Lijuan Geng, and Mihaela Steff to reach the semifinals, where she was defeated by Li Ju. In the bronze medal game, she lost to Chen Jing. In the doubles event, Jing and Li started in the round of 16, where they were defeated by Eldijana Bentsen and Tamara Boroš of Croatia. Jing again won the Sportswoman of the Year award for her Olympic performance. Following the 2000 Olympics, Jing was ranked 12th in the world by the International Table Tennis Federation.\n\nIn between the 2000 and 2004 Olympic games, Jing won medals at the 2001 and 2003 Southeast Asian Games, and at the 2002 Commonwealth Games. At the 2004 Olympic Games, Jing again competed in both the singles and doubles events, reprising her partnership with Li Jiawei in the doubles. Jing and Li began the doubles event in the round of 16, where they were defeated by South Korean team Kim Kyung-Ah and Kim Bok Rae. In the singles event, Jing began in the second round, where she defeated Silvija Erdelji of Serbia, but was knocked out by Kim Hyon-Hui of North Korea in the third round. Jing retired as a player that year.\n\nJing Junhong became the assistant coach of the Singapore women's table tennis team in 2009. She was on staff when, in the 2012 Summer Olympics, Singapore won two bronze medals, an individual medal by Feng Tianwei and a doubles medal by Wang Yuegu and Li Jiawei, Jing's former partner. In 2013, Jing was promoted to head coach, and won the Singapore Table Tennis Association's Coach of the Year award in 2013 and 2014. Under Jing's leadership, the women's team won six gold medals at the 2014 Commonwealth Games, and star player Feng Tianwei picked up additional victories at International Table Tennis Federation events in Japan, Australia, and the Philippines. The women's team also won three third-place medals at the 2014 Asian Games.\n\nIn November 2015, following a public dispute with player Yu Mengyu at the International Table Tennis Federation Polish Open and a request by Yu and Feng Tianwei for a coaching change, Jing Junhong was replaced as the head coach of the women's team. Jing was instead put in charge of several of the Singapore Table Tennis Association's youth development programs, with oversight over both the programs and their coaches.\n"}
{"id": "2148668", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2148668", "title": "Tom Craddick", "text": "Tom Craddick\n\nThomas Russell Craddick Sr., known as Tom Craddick (born September 19, 1943), is member of the Texas House of Representatives representing the 82nd district. Craddick was Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives from January 2003 to January 2009. He was the first Republican to have served as Speaker since Reconstruction. Craddick resides in Midland, the largest city in his district. Craddick was first elected in 1968 at the age of twenty-five. By 2012, he was already the longest-serving member of the Texas state legislature and the second-longest-serving representative in the history of the state.\nIn the general election held on November 6, 2018, Craddick won his 26th term in the legislature. With 37,504 votes (80.3 percent), he defeated the Democratic candidate, Spencer Bounds, who polled 9,207 votes (19.7 percent). In this same election, Craddick's daughter, Christi Craddick, won her second term as a Republican member of the Texas Railroad Commission.\n\nWhile he was a doctoral student at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Craddick decided to run for the legislature to succeed the incumbent Republican Frank Kell Cahoon of Midland, who was not seeking a third two-year term. According to Craddick's official biography, even his father, businessman R.F. Craddick (1913–1986), warned him: \"Texas is run by Democrats. You can't win.\" Although this part of Texas had become very friendly to Republicans at the national level (portions of this area, for instance, supported Barry M. Goldwater's 1964 presidential run, and Midland itself has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1948), Democrats held most offices at the local level well into the 1980s.\n\nNonetheless, the Eagle Scout was elected to the Texas House in 1968, one of eight Republicans in the chamber at that time. His victory came on the same day that Richard M. Nixon was elected as U.S. President.\n\nIn 1972, Craddick and former State Representative Frank Kell Cahoon encouraged Ernest Angelo, Craddick's neighbor, to run for the position of mayor of Midland being vacated by Edwin H. Magruder, Jr. Mayor Pro-tem Pat M. Baskin, the former chairman of the Midland County Democratic Executive Committee, also filed to run. Craddick believed that Baskin if elected would use the mayoral office to attempt to derail Craddick's bid for a third term in the state House in the general election scheduled for November 7, 1972. Angelo agreed to run for mayor if Cahoon would seek one of the at-large city council seats. The deal was struck, and both won their races. Craddick thereafter was elected to his third term in the House.\n\nIn 1975, Craddick was named chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, the first Republican to have chaired a Texas legislative committee in more than a century. In Texas, a legislator need not be in the majority party in order to chair a committee.\n\nOn January 11, 2003, after thirty-four years in the House, Craddick became the first Republican Speaker in more than 130 years. He held the presiding officer's position for six years.\n\nIn December 2006, Craddick faced credible challenges to his re-election as Speaker for the Eightieth Texas Legislature: Brian McCall (R-Plano), Jim Pitts (R-Waxahachie), and Senfronia Thompson (D-Houston), all of whom announced candidacies for the speakership. In early January, McCall withdrew and endorsed Pitts. \nSupporters of Pitts pressed for a secret ballot in order to avoid retribution should their efforts fail, \nwhile Craddick had maintained all along that he had more than the minimum number of votes needed for re-election. \nWhen the secret ballot measure failed, Pitts withdrew, and Craddick was re-elected to a third term as Speaker on January 9, 2007, by a vote of 121-27.\n\nIn January 2009, Craddick was ousted as Speaker after nearly the entire Democratic Caucus and a number of Republicans broke ranks to vote for Joe Straus, a two-term Republican from San Antonio, who stepped down in January 2019. The last Texas House Speaker to be removed had also been a Republican, Ira Hobart Evans, who was rejected in 1871 for cooperating with Democrats on an elections bill. Craddick won reelection to his House seat in the general election on November 2, 2010. Straus then won a second term as Speaker in January 2011, defeating two challengers.\n\nCraddick became increasingly unpopular with not only Democrats but those of his own party, and many called for a new Speaker to be elected.\n\nChaos erupted in the Texas House of Representatives on Friday, May 25, 2007, when Fred Hill, a Republican from Richardson, attempted to raise a question of privilege to remove Craddick from office, but Craddick refused to allow him to raise the question. The attempts to oust Craddick continued through the weekend as other Republicans made additional motions, which were also disallowed for a time, although ultimately successful.\n\nCraddick's close allies, such as Representative Phil King of Weatherford, said that the actions against the Speaker were an effort by Democrats to gain control of the legislature before the legislative and congressional redistricting process of 2011. However, then Representative Byron Cook, a departing Republican from Corsicana, said that the fight was about Craddick having consolidated power with lobbyists and having used campaign contributions to maintain control in the House: \"This is about the convergence of money and power and influence,\" Cook said.\n\nSpecifically, Craddick recessed the legislature for two and a half hours after Representatives attempted to gain recognition to put the question of Craddick's removal to a vote. When Hill asked to vote to remove Mr. Craddick, the Speaker replied: \"The Speaker's power of recognition on any matter cannot be appealed.\"\n\nHis parliamentarian, Denise Davis disagreed, stating that question of privilege relating to the removal of a Speaker from office is such a highly privileged one that even the leader may not refuse. When Craddick shunned her advice, Davis and her assistant, Chris Griesel, resigned. Craddick immediately hired former Representative Terry Keel of Austin to the post as well as former Representative (and present-day lawyer) Ron Wilson as Keel's assistant. The session resumed until 1 a.m. and despite further protests from members of the legislature, Craddick remained in his position as Speaker, and the session was recessed.\n\nThomas Craddick is married to the former Nadine Nayfa, a native of Sweetwater in west Texas. She is of Lebanese descent. In addition to their daughter, Christi, they have a son, Thomas, Jr., and a grandson, Thomas Russell Craddick, III. Craddick holds BBA and MBA degrees from the Rawls College of Business at Texas Tech. He lists his occupation as a sales representative for Mustang Mud, an oilfield supply company, although he also is a real estate speculator and developer.\n\nSince the early 1970s, Craddick's next-door neighbor has been Ernest Angelo, the former mayor of Midland who in 1976 was one of three Texas co-chairmen in the Ronald W. Reagan campaign to wrest the Republican presidential nomination from Gerald R. Ford, Jr., successful in Texas but defeated in a moderately close vote at the national convention held in Kansas City, Missouri. Craddick and Angelo are godparents to each other's children. Clifford Angelo, youngest of the Angelo children, was hired while attending the University of Texas in Austin as a legislative aide to Craddick.\n\nOn November 6, 2012, when Craddick won his 23rd term in the Texas House, his daughter Christi was easily elected as a Republican to the Texas Railroad Commission, the state's oil and gas regulatory body.\n\n"}

It starred the comedian director Jack Neo himself, who cross-dresses as the titular old lady, which in English is translated as \"Grandma Neo\".\n\nThe main character, an 85-year-old lady named Liang Po Po, made a decision to leave her retirement home in search of a new life, with a belief that she can still contribute to society.\n\nOn her first day, she was robbed by female gangster Ah Lian and her comrades, and when Liang tried to work as a gas pump attendant, chaos ensued. Liang then met and befriended a couple of gangsters named Ah Beng and Ah Seng, and got involved in a secret society that is involved in crimes. Taking advantage of Liang's unsuspecting nature, the society used her to sell pirated VCDs, as well as debt collection.\n\nAs Liang develops a genuine friendship with Ah Beng and Ah Seng, the man who runs the secret society, known as Big Boss, decided that his gang should be respected, and enlisted the service of two Hong Kong triad consultants, in an effort to improve the image and profile of the gang. The consultants insisted that gang members should be dressed in suits and sunglasses, and the Big Boss even dreamt of himself getting involved in politics, as a way to exert greater influence on civil society.\n\nTo raise money for an election campaign, the consultants persuaded Big Boss to orchestrate a bank robbery. Liang was seen as an ideal person to carry out the robbery, because it was felt that no one will suspect an elderly person for a robbery, and if caught, Liang is expected to gain sympathy from authorities. The plan was discovered by Ah Beng and Ah Seng, who then tried to send Liang away. Liang, however, refused to leave her friends, she was determined to follow through with the mission, unaware of what it actually entails.\n\nThe robbery was successful, but the bank later reported a much bigger amount of money missing, thus sparking a nationwide hunt for Liang. Meanwhile, both the gangsters and authorities race against each other to find Liang, and recover the money first. As she goes on the run, Liang realized she was used by Big Boss and his consultants, and decided to go on a path to turn the table on those who mistreated her.\n\nThis film was the first produced by Mediacorp Raintree Pictures, and was based on a character that was made popular by a Television Corporation of Singapore (now MediaCorp) television series.\n\nShooting of the film began on 21 September 1998, and involved a 50-member local crew. According to the production company, this was the first Singaporean film to feature high-speed chases, and choreographed fight scene involving hundreds of extra.\n\nIn an effort to broaden the film's appeal, well-known Hong Kong celebrities Eric Tsang and Sheren Tang, as well as Malaysian singer Ah Niu were cast, in supporting roles.\n\nIn addition, Zoe Tay, Chen Liping, Evelyn Tan, Kym Ng, Robin Leong, and Chris Ho appeared in cameos.\n\n"}
{"id": "2148682", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2148682", "title": "Camlp4", "text": "Camlp4\n\nCamlp4 is a software system for writing extensible parsers for programming languages. It provides a set of OCaml libraries that are used to define grammars as well as loadable syntax extensions of such grammars. Camlp4 stands for Caml Preprocessor and Pretty-Printer and one of its most important applications was the definition of domain-specific extensions of the syntax of OCaml.\n\nCamlp4 was part of the official OCaml distribution which is developed at the INRIA. Its original author is Daniel de Rauglaudre. OCaml version 3.10.0, released in May 2007, introduced a significantly modified and backward-incompatible version of Camlp4. De Rauglaudre maintains a separate backward-compatible version, which has been renamed Camlp5. All of the examples below are for Camlp5 or the previous version of Camlp4 (versions 3.09 and prior).\n\nVersion 4.08, released in the summer of 2019, was the last official version of this library. It is currently deprecated. Instead of camlp4 recommend using the PPX (PreProcessor eXtensions) libraries.\n\nA Camlp4 preprocessor operates by loading a collection of compiled modules which define a parser as well as a pretty-printer: the parser converts an input program into an internal representation. This internal representation constitutes the abstract syntax tree (AST). It can be output in a binary form, e.g. it can be passed directly to one of the OCaml compilers, or it can be converted back into a clear text program. The notion of \"concrete syntax\" refers to the format in which the \"abstract syntax\" is represented.\n\nFor instance, the OCaml expression (1 + 2) can also be written ((+) 1 2) or (((+) 1) 2). The difference is only at the level of the concrete syntax, since these three versions are equivalent representations of the same abstract syntax tree. As demonstrated by the definition of a revised syntax for OCaml, the same programming language can use different concrete syntaxes. They would all converge to an abstract syntax tree in a unique format that a compiler can handle.\n\nThe abstract syntax tree is at the center of the syntax extensions, which are in fact OCaml programs. Although the definition of grammars must be done in OCaml, the parser that is being defined or extended is not necessarily related to OCaml, in which case the syntax tree that is being manipulated is not the one of OCaml. Several libraries are provided which facilitate the specific manipulation of OCaml syntax trees.\n\nDomain-specific languages are a major application of Camlp4. Since OCaml is a multi-paradigm language, with an interactive toplevel and a native code compiler, it can be used as a backend for any kind of original language. The only thing that the developer has to do is write a Camlp4 grammar which converts the domain-specific language in question into a regular OCaml program. Other target languages can also be used, such as C.\n\nIf the target language is OCaml, simple syntax add-ons or syntactic sugar can be defined, in order to provide an expressivity which is not easy to achieve using the standard features of the OCaml language. A syntax extension is defined by a compiled OCaml module, which is passed to the camlp4o executable along with the program to process.\n\nCamlp4 includes a domain-specific language as it provides syntax extensions which ease the development of syntax extensions. These extensions allow a compact definition of grammars (codice_1 statements) and quotations such as <:expr< 1 + 1 », i.e. deconstructing and constructing abstract syntax trees in concrete syntax.\n\nThe following example defines a syntax extension of OCaml. It provides a new keyword, codice_2, which can be used as a replacement for codice_3 and provides automatic memoization of functions with pattern matching. Memoization consists in storing the results of previous computations in a table so that the actual computation of the function for each possible argument occurs at most once.\n\nThis is pa_memo.ml, the file which defines the syntax extension:\n\nlet unique =\n\nEXTEND\n\nEND\nExample of program using this syntax extension:\n\nlet counter = ref 0 (* global counter of multiplications *)\n\nlet rec fac = memo\n\nlet run n =\n\nlet _ =\nThe output of the program is as follows, showing that the fac function (factorial) only computes products that were not computed previously:\n\n"}
{"id": "2148702", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2148702", "title": "Jamberoo", "text": "Jamberoo\n\nJamberoo is a town approx 11.3 km inland from Kiama on the South Coast of New South Wales, Australia in the Municipality of Kiama. At the , Jamberoo had a population of 1,667. The town's name is derived from an Aboriginal word meaning 'track'.\n\nIt is well known for the Jamberoo Action Park, Jamberoo Hotel, a pub, and the local dairy-farming community. The Australian Illawarra Shorthorn cattle breed originated in the area. Jamberoo is the birthplace of politician Joseph Cullen.\n\nEuropean history in the valley began in the early 19th century when the cedar-cutters moved through the rainforests gathering this valuable timber. Pioneer settlers followed in the early 1820s with William Davis receiving the first land grant in 1821, followed by John Ritchie and John Cullen shortly afterwards.\n\nMichael Hyam was a property owner by the late 1830s and he laid out the private village of Jamberoo in 1841. The Main South Coast Road formed the northern boundary of his village and at the western end of the town he gave out lots for Protestant Churches. The Presbyterian church of St Stephen stands on the original lot. The Methodist church around the corner in Wyalla St is now the Uniting Church and still hosts services, while the land given to the Church of England, now Anglican Church of Australia has been sold off and the Anglican Church is located north of Hyams Creek on Tates Hill. The old Presbyterian, Anglican and Uniting cemeteries are still located on the original lots, although they have been closed to burials since at least the 1920s\n\nA sign outside the only fuel station in Jamberoo proclaims the town as the birthplace of co-operative dairy production in Australia. The first co-operative butter factory in Australia was begun at Jamberoo in 1884 adjacent to the old Main South Coast Road (now Jamberoo Road), 2 km from the Princes Highway and just west of Spring Creek and the monument marking the old toll gate. The location is better described as Kiama. An obelisk marks the spot.\n\nIn time, there were other butter factories: Woodstock and Wauchope which became the main factory in Factory Lane to the east of the town.\n\nJamberoo has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n\nJamberoo sits at the western end of Minnamurra Swamp, known locally as The Swamp. The Minnamurra River flows from Minnamurra Falls along the northern side of the swamp. Just east of the old butter factory on Factory Lane the river enters a man-made channel that keeps the river flowing on the northern side of the swamp; the original channel meandered through the broad eastern end of the swamp before crossing Swamp Road and running along the south side of the swamp. In times of high tide and high rainfall, the river resumes its old course closing Swamp Road.\n\nThe valley of Jamberoo and the Minnamurra River is steep-sided and reasonably narrow. As a result, the town and valley is not subject to the extremes of weather that nearby Albion Park is. This is a significant observation because the climate data for the district is recorded at Albion Park. Local research (unverified) from Jamberoo weather stations suggests that wind speeds in Jamberoo are approximately half that experienced at Albion Park, while rainfall varies significantly depending on the altitude and proximity to the steep valley sides. Air temperature is not as extreme as recorded for Albion Park.\n\nJamberoo was declared a municipality on 21 November 1890. The butcher's shop in Allowrie Street is the former Council Chamber while the bridge over Hyams Creek that joins the northern and southern sides of the village was opened in 1937 by Mrs Fredericks, Mayor of Jamberoo. Jamberoo is a part of the Municipality of Kiama, State seat of Kiama and Federal seat of Gilmore which, apart from Jamberoo, consists mostly of the metropolitan area of southern Wollongong and Shellharbour.\n\nn the 2016 Census, there were 1,636 people in Jamberoo. 79.9% of people were born in Australia and 90.5% of people spoke only English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 27.1%, Anglican 24.6% and Catholic 24.5%.\n\nEducation in Jamberoo was first provided by the Church of England (now Anglican) on the site of the original grant of land from Michael Hyam. School commenced early in 1842 in a building partly funded by private subscription and government money. After a school teacher left in August 1873, there was talk of converting the school house into a Public School however this did not occur and it reopened in March 1874 with 40 students.\n\nThe Public School came into operation in January 1878 which led to the closure of the denominational schools.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2148703", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2148703", "title": "GBK (character encoding)", "text": "GBK (character encoding)\n\nGBK is an extension of the GB2312 character set for Simplified Chinese characters, used in the People's Republic of China. It includes all unified CJK characters found in GB13000.1-93, i.e. ISO/IEC 10646:1993, or Unicode 1.1. Since its initial release in 1993, GBK has been extended by Microsoft in Code page 936/1386, which was then extended into GBK 1.0. GBK is also the IANA-registered internet name for the Microsoft mapping, which differs from other implementations primarily by the single-byte euro sign at 0x80.\n\n\"GB\" abbreviates Guojia Biaozhun, which means \"national standard\" in Chinese, while \"K\" stands for \"Extension\" (扩展 \"kuòzhǎn\"). GBK not only extended the old standard GB2312 with Traditional Chinese characters, but also with Chinese characters that were simplified after the establishment of GB2312 in 1981. With the arrival of GBK, certain names with characters formerly unrepresentable, like the 镕 (\"róng\") character in former Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's name, are now representable.\n\n, GBK is the second-most popular Chinese encoding (after GB2312, while likely they are decoded as one and the same), with 3.6% of web pages served from China and territories declaring it, or 0.2% of all web pages globally, that is when marked as such, but all major web browsers decode documents marked as e.g. \"\" or \"GB2312\" as if they were marked \"gbk\" (while not all do so for pages marked \"GB_2312\"), and GBK and the subset encoding have a combined 16.7% share (or 0.6% globally).\n\nIn 1993, the Unicode 1.1 standard was released, including 20,902 characters used in mainland China, Taiwan, Japan and Korea. Following this, China released GB13000.1-93, the Guobiao standard equivalent of Unicode 1.1.\n\nThe GBK character set was defined in 1993 as an extension of GB2312-80, while also including the characters of GB13000.1-93 through the unused codepoints available in GB2312. Hence GBK is backward compatible with GB2312.\n\nMicrosoft implemented GBK in Windows 95 and Windows NT 3.51 as Code Page 936. While GBK was never an official standard, widespread usage of Windows 95 led to GBK becoming the \"de facto\" standard. While GBK included all the Chinese characters defined in Unicode 1.1 and GB13000.1-93, these standards used different code tables. The primary reason for its existence was simply to bridge the gap between GB2312-80 and GB13000.1-93.\n\nIn 1995, China National Information Technology Standardization Technical Committee set down the Chinese Internal Code Extension Specification (), Version 1.0, known as GBK 1.0, which is a slight extension of Codepage 936. The newly added 95 characters were not found in GB 13000.1-1993, and were provisionally assigned Unicode PUA code points.\n\nMicrosoft later added the euro sign to Code page 936 and assigned the code 0x80 to it. This is not a valid code point in GBK 1.0.\n\nIn 2000, the GB18030-2000 standard was released, superseding yet maintaining compatibility with GBK 1.0. It increased the number of definitions of Chinese characters and extended the number of possible characters through the implementation of four-byte character spaces. The subset of GB 18030 consisting of one-byte and two-byte characters is sometimes also referred to as GBK. Mapping to Unicode has been slightly changed, though, as some characters are now defined in Unicode. In the most up-to-date form of the standard, GB 18030-2005, only 24 characters are still mapped to Unicode PUA (see GB 18030#PUA.)\n\nIn 2002, GBK was registered as an IANA charset; the registration uses code page 936 mapping as well as CP936/MS936 aliases, but refers to GBK 1.0 specification. W3C's technical recommendation published in 2015 defines a GBK \"encoder\" as a GB 18030 encoder with a single-byte euro sign and without four-byte sequences (while W3C's GBK \"decoder\" specification has no such limitation, decodes as , i.e. with same range of letters as all of Unicode).\n\nA character is encoded as 1 or 2 bytes. A byte in the range codice_1–codice_2 is a single byte that means the same thing as it does in ASCII. Strictly speaking, there are 95 characters and 33 control codes in this range.\n\nA byte with the high bit set indicates that it is the first of 2 bytes. Loosely speaking, the first byte is in the range codice_3–codice_4 (that is, never codice_5 or codice_6), and the second byte is codice_7–codice_8 except codice_2 for some areas and codice_10–codice_4 for others.\n\nMore specifically, the following ranges of bytes are defined:\n\nIn graphical form, the following figure shows the space of all 64K possible 2-byte codes. Green and yellow areas are assigned GBK codepoints, red are for user-defined characters. The uncolored areas are invalid byte combinations.\n\nThe areas indicated in the previous section as GBK/1 and GBK/2, taken by themselves, is simply GB2312-80 in its usual encoding, GBK/1 being the non-hanzi region and GBK/2 the hanzi region. GB2312, or more properly the EUC-CN encoding thereof, takes a pair of bytes from the range codice_10–codice_4, like any 94² ISO-2022 character set loaded into GR. This corresponds to the lower-right quarter of the illustration above. However, GB2312 does not assign any code points to the rows located at codice_14–codice_15 and codice_16–codice_4, even though it had staked out the territory. GBK added extensions to these rows. You can see that the two gaps were filled in with user-defined areas.\n\nMore significantly, GBK extended the range of the bytes. Having two-byte characters in the ISO-2022 GR range gives a limit of 94²=8,836 possibilities. Abandoning the ISO-2022 model of strict regions for graphics and control characters, but retaining the feature of low bytes being 1-byte characters and pairs of high bytes denoting a character, you could potentially have 128²=16,384 positions. GBK takes part of that, extending the range from codice_10–codice_4 (94 choices for each byte) to codice_3–codice_4 (126 choices) for the first byte and codice_7–codice_4 (191 choices) for the second byte, for a total of 24,066 positions.\n\nMicrosoft's Code Page 936 is generally thought of as being GBK. However, the 95 PUA characters added in GBK 1.0 are not included in Code Page 936. Code Page 936 also has a single-byte euro sign at 0x80 which GBK 1.0 doesn't have.\n\nGBK's successor, GB18030-2000, uses the remaining range available to the second byte (–) to further expand the number of possibilities while retaining GBK as a subset.\n\n"}

For example, a drummer might play a beat, whereupon the engineer might then replace all of the snare hits with the sound of a hand-clap. It is considered by some to be one of the most arcane practices of the modern music production industry and is an example of the considerable influence of computers in modern music, even in genres not strictly classified as \"electronic music.\"\n\nThe practice is an extension of the recording techniques of the 1970s through to the 1980s, wherein the constant search for better or \"more perfect\" sound led to a variety of techniques being tested, including the extensive use of drum machines. Among these techniques was drum replacement, which was pioneered by producer Roger Nichols while in the studio with Steely Dan in the late '70s, and has grown in both popularity and complexity since. One of the most common uses of this technique is the replacing of every snare hit in a performance (which may or may not sound subjectively \"good\") with an \"ideal\" snare drum hit.\nShould the decision be made to use drum replacement techniques, the actual implementation of the practice usually falls to an audio engineer during the mixing stage.\n\nDrum replacing is often mentioned, along with autotune, harmonizers, and advanced compressors, as being symptomatic of the \"artificial nature\" of modern western music by certain critics. Some critics suggest that the practice defeats the purpose of having a live drummer as opposed to a drum machine, since the end result is effectively exactly the same as what a drum machine would produce if the drum machine had a custom sample recorded for it by the engineer. Others laud it as one of the subtleties of studio technique, used by engineers to give their craft more complexity in an increasingly automated world.\n\n"}
{"id": "2148742", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2148742", "title": "Gundam Evolve", "text": "Gundam Evolve\n\n, also known as Mobile Suit Gundam Evolve, is a series of promotional short films set in the different timelines of the Gundam series. Originally there were only five Evolve episodes, produced from 2001 to 2003, Bandai created ten more Evolve episodes from 2004 to 2007. While the first few episodes took place in the Universal Century, the newer clips also showed Gundams from the other timelines.\n\nThe clips show alternative scenes, side-stories or omakes for fans. The clips feature a mix of animation media which vary from traditional animation to 3D rendering to cel-shaded animation. The target is to show the Gundams and other mobile suits in high-quality CGI. A total of 15 shorts were released and later compiled in three separate volumes, namely Gundam Evolve ../+ (\"Plus\"), Gundam Evolve ../Ω (\"Omega\") and Gundam Evolve ../Α (\"Alpha\"). Each volume consists of 5 episodes.\n\nThe logo features a battered Core Fighter floating upside down, as seen on the final episode of the original \"Mobile Suit Gundam\" series.\n\nThis episode is the only one that features no CG. Instead it is a short clip show of the original \"Mobile Suit Gundam\" series. In this episode Amuro Ray, waiting to start in the final battle of A Baoa Qu, sits in his RX-78-2 Gundam while the other forces are already fighting. He recalls many of the battles he has fought until now, beginning with his fight against the mobile armor Elmeth when he killed Lalah Sune. Afterward he recalls the battle against the Black Tri-Stars, Ramba Ral and Char Aznable. He also thinks about the people important to him who died, including Ryu Jose, Matilda Ajan and Sleggar Law. Then he hears Sayla Mass who tells him that if they can overcome war, humanity should as well. Soon afterward, Amuro launches.\n\nThe events of this episode take place after the Gryps Conflict. The story revolves around a video tape which is sent to Kamille Bidan by \"Argama\" chief engineer Astonaige Medoz. On the video Astonaige wishes him a quick recovery and it also contains a video scene from a battle training at which Kamille participated during the Gryps Conflict. In the training he uses the Gundam Mk.II to fight against several drones and two Rick Dias in a combat simulation. Although he thinks it is too easy he accidentally destroys the camera probe recording the training. The episode ends with a written report by Kamille apologizing over damaging the surveillance pod, in which he angrily wrote in later sections denying himself of \"any\" responsibility for the incident, protesting over having to write such a formal apology at all, and going further on to accuse his superiors Quattro Bajeena and Henken Bekkener of being totally irrational and incompetent.\n\nThe third \"Evolve\" clip is about \"G Gundam\". It features Domon Kasshu, who is practicing T'ai chi with the God Gundam. However suddenly Rain Mikamura appears in the Rising Gundam and attacks him because he was away for two days. He tells her he was only training but she believes that he was off chasing skirts, and the two fight. Trying to end the battle, Domon attacks with the God Gundam's God Finger (actually the Sekiha Tenkyo-Ken), causing Rain to counter with the Rising Gundam's Rising Finger (actually Rising's own rendition of the Sekiha Tenkyo-Ken) attack. Both attacks clash together with an immense power, but Rain's attack breaks through. When the smoke clears, Rising Gundam is performing Tai Chi while God Gundam looks on, with insults like \"Womanizer\" and \"Lazy Bum\" written all over its head.\n\nAfter the last clip played in the Future Century, this episode returns to the Universal Century. It is revealed that several people leaked information about the Gundam Development Project to the Zeon Forces because Jamitov Hymem dislikes it. Afterwards a ruined MS-14A Gelgoog is shown floating in space after a group of Gelgoog Marine Types and MS-06F Zaku II mobile suits attack the \"La Vie en Rose\". To counter them a woman named Defrah Kar pilots the Gundam GP03 Dendrobium Stamen to destroy them. To make this easier she uses the Orchis platform and, thanks to its powerful weapons, is easily able to destroy them, and thanks to her I-field she is even able to defend herself from the attack of a large battleship. However, after the battle and while ejecting the Stamen from the Orchis, a severely damaged Gelgoog is able to shoot at the cockpit of the Stamen, killing Defrah and incidentally destroying the experimental cockpit. Afterwards the people who looked on the Gundam data examine the data of the GP04 Gerbera. This animation may explain the confusion concerning the two types of cockpits for the Stamen unit.\n\nThis episode shows a bright alternative scenario for Quess Paraya from \"Char's Counterattack\", as Tomino's attitude during \"Char's Counterattack\" was rather grim and depressing. The episode begins with Quess, who had apparently used the NZ-333 Alpha Azieru to severely damage Hathaway Noa's RGM-89 Jegan. Afterwards Amuro Ray in his RX-93 Nu Gundam has a Newtype reaction to her and confronts her. He accuses her of not understanding Hathaway's feelings, but Quess doesn't listen and attacks him. However Amuro is able to trap her inside the Fin Funnel's beam barriers. Afterwards they hear Hathaway who tells Quess not to be angry, and Amuro tells Quess that Hathaway isn't dead. Thanks to this and Amuro's words she calms down and she finally uses the Alpha Azieru to rescue Hathaway.\n\nThis episode was written by Yoshiyuki Tomino, whose change of outlook used this animation to give Quess a happy ending as an alternative to her death in the movie.\n\nThe clip starts off with a battle between the YMF-X000A Dreadnought and several ZGMF-600 GuAIZ. Although Prayer Reverie tells them that he doesn't want to fight they continue and one of them slams him in an asteroid. Suddenly a DRAGOON-equipped Dreadnought \"ghost\" appears, separates itself from the real Dreadnought and attacks the GuAIZ, destroying all of them very easily. Afterwards it fires all its weapons on the real Dreadnought but the attack is stopped by the CAT1-X1/3 Hyperion. Then the two suits battle and finally Prayer joins the fight and together with the Hyperion he destroys the \"ghost\". At last the two suits turn their weapons on each other. In the end, this turned out to be a dream of Prayer's, foreshadowing his eventual battle with the Hyperion.\n\nThis episode begins with a figure in a spacesuit (Heero Yuy) setting bombs, then fades to Gundam engineer Doctor J, apparently imprisoned. He talks to a shadowy visitor about history and his young protege as the person in space suit tries to escape the facility he has just sabotaged. The guards catch up to him, but he uses a nearby Virgo II mobile doll to distract them and escape to his machine - Wing Zero. Heero uses the twin buster rifle to break out of the base's hangar, but loses the weapon in the escape and resorts to using a Virgo II beam rifle. He is chased by several Virgo IIs along the length of the facility, which is actually a gigantic colony cannon. After dealing with his pursuit, Heero attacks the cannon directly with his beam rifle as the bombs begin to go off. Doctor J finishes his narration, commenting to his visitor (now revealed as Relena Peacecraft) that he chose Heero's codename personally. As the colony cannon explodes, Heero flies away to his next mission.\n\n\"Gundam Evolve 7\" was written and directed by Shukou Murase, who was character designer for the original \"Gundam Wing\" series. The original Japanese voice actors are used; Hikaru Midorikawa for Heero Yuy and Minoru Inaba for Doctor J. The 3D animation was based on Bandai's Master Grade \"Wing Gundam Zero - Endless Waltz\" model.\n\nThis \"Evolve\"'s place within \"Gundam Wing\" continuity is unclear, but it appears to take place during the last story arc of the series, after White Fang captures Relena but before Doctor J dies. During this period, Heero was working with the other four Gundam pilots; their absence from this mission is a source of much of this confusion. However, the event is mentioned in secret documents at the beginning of the novel \"\", where it was stated to take place in the spring of A.C. 196, after the TV series and before Endless Waltz.\n\nIn a secret ZAFT desert base, the Aile Strike Gundam faces off against several GINN OCHER Types. The animation adapted the style of visual special effect seen in \"The Matrix\", and featured the Grand Slam Sword included with the Perfect Grade and later Master Grade Strike Gundam model kits.\n\n\"In space there lies a giant mobile armor called the Psycho Weapon and it's decimating the EFSF fleets so it's up to 3 Zeta Gundams to destroy the huge weapon...\"\n\nAlthough numbered 9, this \"Evolve\" is the last to come out in \"Gundam Evolve ../Ω\". It is said to feature three Zeta Gundams, three pilots with the aliases Red Snake, Grey Wolf, and White Unicorn as well as an enormous MA of unknown affiliation in orbit. There is also the mentioning of the Chakra Laboratory of AEUG/Karaba and a top-secret mission.\n\nRed Snake's Zeta Gundam is red, with redesigned armour on the chest, feet, skirt and lower leg. The new armour sports a spiked look. In addition, the wings are wider and pointed, and there is a large vertical spike behind its head, apparently protruding from the middle of its back. The pilot apparently is a young Newtype girl named Yurii Ajissah, who holds a special feeling towards her squadron leader, White Unicorn.\n\nWhite Unicorn is believed to be the legendary ace Amuro Ray, based on the physical appearance, personal logo, military ranking, Yurii's memory of their encounter at Side 6 during the One Year War, and most importantly, Toru Furuya being the character's voice actor. His Zeta Gundam unit appears to be the same one that Amuro piloted in the short CGI film \"Green Divers\" (white with purple stripes, plus Amuro's signature \"A\" symbol on the left shoulder armour).\n\nGrey Wolf's Zeta Gundam (nicknamed \"Buster Zeta\") unit is a yellow colour with two additional fins/airfoils on its upper back. Grey Wolf is unhappy with his machine's colors and would have preferred it to be grey. This, coupled with his nickname, his \"Grey Wolf\" logo (which is actually a white wolf head) and the fact that he is a former Zeon pilot, seems to imply that Grey Wolf is actually Zeon ace pilot Shin Matsunaga, the infamous \"White Wolf of Solomon\". Similarly, the original pilot of Red Snake's Zeta is implied to be Johnny Ridden, who was reassigned since Red Zeta is a Newtype-use machine.\n\nJudau is assigned to protect/escort the space transport ship \"Jupitris\" on his birthday. While on the recovery missions he encounters Neo Zeon forces pursuing an AMX-004-3 Quebeley MK.II. Seeing the Quebeley posing no threat, Judau decides to come to its aid, despite his ZZ-GR being designed for space operations and not battle. During the battle a \"present\" cargo rocket from Judau's sister Leina arrives, and is revealed to be an improved version of the original ZZ Gundam's B-Parts, allowing Judau to fight off the attackers and save the Quebeley's pilot.\n\nIn the end, the pilot of the Qubeley is seen to be a Ple clone. The magazine \"Gundam Ace\" stated that she is one of the only two surviving Ple clones of the final battle in ZZ, the other being Ple 12.\n\nNovice Federation pilot Hiden and a few other survey the recent battle ground of A Baoa Qu in a squad of RB-79 Ball. Word comes in that Zeon remnants are about to attack. Though afraid, the young pilots proceed through the silent interiors of A Baoa Qu. Without warning, gunshots echo through the air and Hiden's party is killed one-by-one. When Hiden, the sole survivor, finally destroys the enemy, he discovers that it was piloted by a young woman, whose body floats by him. In the ending credits, the cockpit of his Ball is empty.\n\nThe plot of this episode closely parallels a real-world encounter in Germany, May 1945. An American convoy is bombarded with an 88mm cannon hidden in rubble after Germany surrendered. Claud Amensen, a war correspondent and Lt. Ronald Bourbon, a soldier, reported that the cannon was operated by a 15-yer old Hitlersjungen girl. She surrendered when she ran out of ammo, and was brought to a German police office later, never heard from again.\n\nQuattro Bajeena boards his Rick Dias for a battle simulation to transfer combat data to the mass-production model. The data personnel has some fun with him, turning the Rick Dias's monitor red, revealing his own old Zaku from his \"Red Comet\" days as his opponent. Quattro is gradually cornered by the Zaku... Can he win against the legendary Red Comet?\n\nAnd then he switches to the Hyaku Shiki, and faces off with an old rival...\n\n\"As the AEUG attempt to enter the atmosphere for the drop operation on Jaburo, they come under attack by the Titans' Marasai mobile suits. An orbital battle ensues...\"\n\nThe storyline of this clip centers around a young Titans pilot named Jonathan, as he deals with the battle and his difficult personal affairs at the same time.\n\nAs evil Zaku bandits terrorise the country of Ark. Rekka Musha Gundam comes to the rescue chasing their leader Mazaku for the Scroll of Light he had stolen. Stopping briefly at a teahouse, Rekka informs three young kids about the Seven of Light Gundam team he leads. Suddenly Mazaku's Gelgoog minions set the building on fire. After defeating the minions, Mazaku appears and uses the Scroll to transform into the gigantic Hadou Musha Mazaku. Rekka is easily defeated by his gigantic and powerful foe. The children prepare to surrender but Rekka stands up and cries out. His noble spirit causes the Scroll to abandon Mazaku and give Rekka its true power, giving him the Armour of Light. With his new power and cheered on by the children, Rekka slices Mazaku in half and saves the day.\n\nThe episode's kanji title \"頑駄無 異歩流武\" (ガンダム イボルブ) is actually a pun similar to Lady Mondegreen, and is read as \"\"Gan Da Mu I Bo Ru Bu\"\", namely \"Gundam Evolve\".\n\nThe short is a re-imagined version of of the original TV series with updated mechanical designs.\n\n\"Challia Bull was found to have the attributes of a Newtype during his activities in the Jupiter Energy Fleet. While doubtful of his own abilities, he is recruited and assigned by commander-in-chief Gihren to serve in Char Aznable's combat unit under Kycilia's command. Even as he senses the girl he met, known as Lalah Sune, to be something of a Newtype, the fierce combat with the Federation ace-piloted Gundam changed his convictions...\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2148755", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2148755", "title": "Eymundar þáttr hrings", "text": "Eymundar þáttr hrings\n\nEymundar þáttr hrings is a short Norse saga, which is preserved in two versions. One of them appears as \"Eymundar þáttr hrings\" in the Flatey Book and the other one is an introductory chapter in \"Yngvars saga víðförla\". They deal with the adventures of Varangians in the service of Yaroslav I the Wise.\n\nThe main difference between the two versions is that in \"Eymundar þáttr hrings\", the hero is a Norwegian, whereas \"Yngvars saga víðförla\" describes him as ruling Svíþjóð, but these two terms were not entirely mutually exclusive at this time. \n\n\"Svíþjóð\" refers to the sweonas people. 'Þjoð' (Theod) is related to Proto-Indo-European *tewtéh₂, meaning “tribe”, rather than land. Whereas Svealand today refers to the territories of modern Sweden between Norrland and Götaland, old Sviþjoð extended eastwards, far beyond the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Finland, what we may recognize as Varangian Russia, encompassing Garðariki. It is important to note that we are referring to the Age of Migration, which probably didn't really begin as peoples were semi-sedentary since time immemorial. According to King Alfred of Wessex's world history based on Orosius we would find Sarmatia to the east of Sviþjoð; whereto and beyond which Eymundar travels. Norrland in Sweden may refer as much to the eponymous Nórr as Norway (Nórvegr) does. Torre and his children, Nórr, Górr and Gói are from Gandvik, in the Gulf of Bothnia. This region to the north of the Golf of Helsing, in the Fornaldar Sögur, is Jotland, called Kvenland and Finland. Nórr's sister, Gói, marries Hrolf son of Svaða, which may or may not be read as eponymous of the Swedes. Thus we may say that Norwegians and Swedes are mixed from the very beginning of memorial times, even though the distinction is from old the dividing line between the non-Germanic Norse and the Germanic Sweonas. \n\n\n\n"}

He held the position from February 1, 2006, to July 2, 2015, when he was succeeded by Gregory L. Fenves. Before his death, Powers held the Hines H. Baker and Thelma Kelley Baker Chair at the University of Texas School of Law.\n\nPowers was selected in November 2005 as the sole finalist for the position of president of the University of Texas at Austin. In December 2005, he was officially named president of the university and succeeded Larry Faulkner when he left office in February 2006. Prior to his appointment, he had served as dean of the University of Texas School of Law since 2000. Powers resigned the presidency in June 2015, partly as the result of external pressures regarding admissions practices at the university.\n\nPowers obtained his B.A. in chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, and his J.D. from Harvard Law School. During his undergraduate years at Berkeley, he became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity, and at Harvard he was managing editor of the \"Harvard Law Review\".\n\nPowers also worked at Southern Methodist University, the University of Michigan, and the University of Washington. Powers was a former member of the Enron Corporation board of directors and chaired the Special Investigative Committee to investigate the causes of Enron's bankruptcy. He was also a member of the board of trustees of Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary from 2004 to 2010.\n\nPowers has authored several law texts, including:\n\nPowers was a member of the American Law Institute and served as the Reporter on several of the Restatements of the Law, Torts:\n\nIn 2008, Powers was appointed to the rank of Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur in France's orders of chivalry. In 2012, he became vice chair of the Association of American Universities and became chair of the organization on October 22, 2013. He was a member of Westminster Presbyterian Church in Austin.\n\nWhile president, Powers oversaw the reform of the undergraduate curriculum and the founding of both the School of Undergraduate Studies and the Dell Medical School. An eight-year fundraising project he spearheaded called the Campaign for Texas raised $3.12 billion for the university. During his tenure the University also completed or began construction on 13 new buildings.\n\nDespite his successes, Powers's final four years were marked by growing opposition to the status quo in higher education in Austin. A group of regents appointed by then-Governor Rick Perry attempted to instantiate the \"Seven Breakthrough Solutions\" of Austin entrepreneur Jeff Sandefer. Sandefer's ideas for the restructuring of the University were thought by many to be inimical to its research mission. Perry had endorsed the \"seven solutions\" at a private meeting attended by two of his appointed regents at the Texas Public Policy Foundation in 2008. In the face of mounting pressure from the Board of Regents to implement Sandefer's program, Powers remained steadfast in his support for the University's traditional role and shape. Such actions made him a target of various reformers, and at the same time an admired figure within the higher education community: Powers was elected to Chair the Association of American Universities in 2013.\n\nSoon after the 2011 appointment of regent Wallace L. Hall Jr., a college friend of Sandefer's, Powers became the focus of multiple investigations by Hall. Hall's interests as a regent centered largely on Powers's role as leader of its flagship campus in Austin, even though the University of Texas System includes fourteen institutions. Having probed accounting procedures in its capital campaign and a forgivable loan program administered by a private foundation in support of its law school faculty, Hall turned his attention to external influence on admissions at the University. A series of document requests revealed that powerful individuals often sought to obtain favoritism toward various applicants, and sometimes succeeded. In May 2014, a blog post reported that various regents had asked then UT System Chancellor Francisco Cigarroa to fire Powers. Almost immediately, a grassroots campaign arose in his support. A Facebook group named \"I Stand With Bill Powers\" attracted nearly 10,000 members.\n\nOn July 4, 2014, an anonymous source reported that UT System Chancellor Francisco Cigarroa had asked Powers to resign, prior to the impending meeting of the Board of Regents, or face termination. The Board meeting agenda indicated regents would discuss Powers in an executive session. Cigarroa attributed the request to a \"breakdown of communication, collegiality, trust and a willingness to work together for the good of the university.\" Powers at first indicated he would not resign, saying it would \"cast the university and our state in a highly unfavorable light.\" However, on July 9, 2014, Cigarroa released a statement that Powers nevertheless agreed to resign effective June 2015.\n\nOn February 12, 2015, an investigation ordered by the University of Texas found that Powers had helped certain applicants, including those with lesser academic credentials, gain admission if they had been recommended by legislators and influential people. According to the report, from 2009 to 2014, well-connected students flagged by university officials were admitted 74% of the time compared to an overall admission rate of 40%. President Powers and his Chief of Staff \"each failed to speak with candor and forthrightness expected of people in their positions of trust and leadership,\" the report stated. Powers agreed to step down in June 2014. He told the \"Wall Street Journal\" that he had \"intervened on behalf of a relatively small number of students\" but denied that it was \"undue influence.\" Subsequently, the \"Austin American-Statesman\" determined that, as Chancellor, Cigarroa had participated in this selfsame aspect of the admissions process, sometimes making notes on the letters about the status of the individuals requesting special consideration in admissions.\n\nPowers was first married to Karen Devendorf. They had two children and the marriage ended in divorce. He then married Kim Heilbrun, his wife of 36 years; they had three children together. He died on March 10, 2019, in Austin from complications from a fall several months earlier and from oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, a rare adult-onset muscle disorder. He is survived by all five children, as well as 6 grandchildren.\n\n"}

He was the founding member, songwriter and lead vocalist of the bands Yano, Pan, and dongabay, which are now all defunct. In 2005, he pursued a solo career as an independent artist by releasing an album entitled \"Sampol\". In 2017, he formed a rock band named Dong Abay Music Organization or D.A.M.O. while having other endeavors such as a songwriting school.\n\nAbay was born on April 5, 1971 in Manila, Philippines to Manuel Abay and Susana Martin. He is married to Ninj Botor Reyes. They have a son named Awit (Tagalog for \"song\" or \"chant\"), born on May 15, 2002.\n\nIn 1992, Dong Abay, Eric Gancio and Larry Mapolon met in \"Patatag\", a progressive vocal ensemble. After a year, they decided to form a band called NG (pronounced as \"en-ji\" and derived from the Ng diagraph of the Filipino alphabet) with percussionist Renmin Nadela. Abay and Gancio remained and recruited musical arranger and bassist, Onie Badiang to the group. Eventually, the band's name was renamed to Yano. They recorded their demo at the home studio of alternative artist Joey Ayala in June 1993. One of the tracks, \"\"Kumusta Na?\",\" (\"How Are You?\") a song about the \"EDSA Revolution\", found its way to a local radio station where the group was first heard. This paved the way for Yano to become active in the local club circuit. Mayrics, Club Dredd, 70s Bistro were among the first clubs that Yano performed in. Drummers for the band included Nowie Favila (Ang Grupong Pendong), Nonong Timbalopez (Put3Ska, Ex President's Combo), Jun Nogoy (Coffeebreak Island) and Harley Alarcon (Rizal Underground). In 1994, the band's self-titled debut album came out and spawned classic Filipino rock songs such as \"\"Banal Na Aso, Santong Kabayo\"\" (\"Holy Dog, Saintly Horse\"), \"\"Tsinelas\"\" (\"Slippers\") and \"Esem\" (wordplay for SM or Shoemart mall). This was followed by a string of successful concerts around the Philippine archipelago.\n\nIn 1994, at the height of Yano's popularity, Abay had to temporarily quit his schooling at the University of the Philippines Diliman, where he was an Arts and Letters student, to pursue a career in music. Yano released 2 more albums under BMG, a major label : \"\"Bawal\"\" (\"Taboo\") in 1996 and \"\"Tara\"\" (\"C'mon\") in 1997. The eponymous debut album was first released under Alpha Records but was later re-issued by BMG.\n\nDuring the late 1990s, Abay suffered from clinical depression after quitting Yano. He only stayed in his bedroom for five years. Although, Abay describe this episode as a self-imposed hiatus. He came out of depression while writing new songs set into poetry. He later called Badiang to borrow a guitar and jam.\n\nIn 2002, Abay returned to the music scene and formed Pan together with Onie Badiang, former bassist of Yano. The outcome was an album titled \"\"Parnaso ng Payaso\"\" (\"A Clown's Collection of Poetry.\"- \"see Parnassus\"). Some notable songs from the album include \"Dumpsite\", \"\"Hula\"\" (\"Prediction\", which won as Best Folk/Pop Recording at the AWIT Awards in 2003), \"\"Mabuhay!\"\" (\"Long Live\") and \"\"Rebolusyon\"\" (\"Revolution\"). Pan played for the local rock circuit with bassist, Milo Duane Cruz and drummer Melvin Leyson.\n\nIn 2003, Abay decided to go back to school to finish his bachelor's degree. Thus, the demise of Pan. Aside from his music, Abay got busy exploring other medium and art forms like installation work, visual arts, photography to name a few. He also became busy lecturing and giving workshops around the country.\n\nIn early 2005, Abay became an indie artist and initially released an EP called \"\"Sampol\"\" (\"Sample\") at the University of the Philippines as part of his undergraduate thesis. This work consists of acoustic tracks, which were later reborn as full-band pieces in \"\"Flipino\",\" released in May 2006. The album was produced by Robin Rivera, Abay's Art Studies professor in U.P. and album producer of The Eraserheads who eventually hired ex-Eraserheads Raimund Marasigan and Buddy Zabala to play in the entire album. \"\"Flipino\"\" proved Abay's relevance to Philippine music by releasing songs such as \"\"Perpekto\"\" (\"Perfect\"), \"Bombardment\" and \"\"Tuyo\"\" (\"Dry\")\". A month before that, Abay finally earned his degree of Bachelor of Arts in Philippine Studies (Areas: Creative Writing in Filipino and Humanities) from the University of the Philippines after 18 long years.\n\nIn 2013, he released a conceptual album called \"Rebulto\" (\"Bust\"), which focuses entirely on the Rizal Monument along Roxas Boulevard in Manila, and written from the perspective of Jose Rizal, considered one the Philippine National Heroes, for which the monument stand, in the present day. The lyrics are mostly written in the first person, except for a couple of tracks, notably, the first track, \"Kilometro Zero\" (\"Kilometer Zero\"), which is a collation of facts about the Rizal Monument, all lifted from Wikipedia. (In the Philippines, the highway system uses the Rizal Monument, or kilometer zero as a reference for metric distance to any point in the country.) The album was also produced and performed by Raimund Marasigan and Buddy Zabala.\n\nIn 2017, he formed a band called Dong Abay Music Organization or D.A.M.O. and they plan to release an album entitled \"Humanidad\" funded through crowdsourcing.\n\n\n\nAll tracks by Dong Abay and Eric Gancio, except where noted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In addition to Richmond, the district covers the cities of El Cerrito, San Pablo, Pinole, and Hercules and the unincorporated areas of Bayview-Montalvin Manor, East Richmond Heights, El Sobrante, Kensington, North Richmond, and Tara Hills.\n\nThe district currently has six neighborhood-assignment high schools, six neighborhood-assignment middle schools, and thirty-six neighborhood-assignment elementary and primary schools along with various continuation and alternative schools. Here is a graphical interactive tool via the District Web site for figuring out the boundaries and locations for neighborhood-assignment schools.\n\nThe WCCUSD incurred $42.5 million in debt when the then-named Richmond Unified School District went bankrupt in 1990 under Superintendent Walter Marks and the state, under court order, financed district operations. The bankruptcy affected the credit rating of the City of Richmond, therefore the name was changed. In 1991 the district had to be bailed out by the state. As of Fall 2005, the school district is $7 million in debt. The district has been lobbying IBM to forgive 5 million dollars in debt from obsolete computers purchased in 1989. To decrease expenditures, the district is planning to close schools over the next two years.\n\nIn 2012 the district was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union for the \"decrepit\" conditions at Community Day School. The alternative school was reported to have no electricity, heating, or bathrooms in addition to rampant rodent and feline excrement. Furthermore, the roof was leaking, there were insufficient seats or desks for students and mushrooms were found to be growing from the floor. Two thirds of students were also reported as being chronically truant. It was also noted that there was not usually a math or science teacher available. Students needing to use a bathroom facility must be escorted by staff to Gompers Continuation High School. The stated goal of the suit is to improve the learning conditions and available supplies and opportunities for the small school body.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Holden made national headlines with his walk.\n\nBill Holden grew up at the beginning of the television era in the United States. His father was a die-hard baseball fan. In 1957, Holden had his first in-person baseball experience, going to a Chicago Cubs home game. Holden became a lifetime Cubs fan instantly.\n\nRon Santo became Holden's favorite player.\n\nHolden has followed the Cubs his whole life since seeing them play in person for the first time. He chose to become a teacher instead of a baseball player, however, and, in 1966, he enrolled at Southern Illinois University, graduating in 1970.\n\nHolden got his first job as a teacher in 1973. He has been working as a teacher since. He became interested in teaching Native American children, so, after many years teaching in the Illinois public schools system, he relocated to Camp Verde, Arizona. At Camp Verde, he became aware of the alarming incidence of diabetes among Indian children. He started teaching groups of children that suffered from the disease.\n\nOn New Year's Eve 2004, his son presented him with the docu-film \"This Old Cub\", based on Santo's experience as a diabetic player in MLB. After watching the film seven times before going to bed that morning, Holden became inspired and convinced that he needed to do something to help find a cure for diabetes.\n\nOn January 11, 2005, Holden began his walk, hoping to cover at least 12 miles each day. Holden crossed over six states, including New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma and Missouri, apart from Arizona and Illinois. He had to battle weariness and summer heat along the way. According to his own account, Holden had a brush with death when he was about to get run over by a car, but the drivers recognized him and waved.\n\nHolden had told Santo about the fundraising walk before it took place, gaining Santo's admiration.\n\nOn June 29, Holden arrived at Harry Caray's restaurant in Rosemont, Illinois. He overnighted there, as he had previously done in several odd places and small hotels.\n\nAfter arriving at the famous Cubs baseball stadium, Wrigley Field, on July 1, Holden, who was joined by Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich during the final steps of his walk, threw that day's symbolic first pitch to Kerry Wood, as the Cubs played the Washington Nationals. During the game's seventh inning stretch, he and Santo sang \"Take Me Out to the Ballgame\".\n\nHolden has arthritis in both of his knees. His fund-raising walk made headlines in newspapers across his home country, including \"The Arizona Republic\" and many others.\n\nRon Santo told reporters, \"When he mentioned the fact that he was going to walk from Arizona to Wrigley Field to raise money for diabetes, I couldn't believe it! Then, when I heard he was 20 miles away, I'm saying 'get in the car and drive it. You've made it!' But he said, 'Nope, I'm going to walk'. I mean, think about that. It's amazing!\"\n\n"}

The commune is mountainous and forested in the south-east portion but with farmland in the northwest of the commune. There is one border crossing to Spain on the southern border at the village of Dantxana.\n\n\"Ainhoa\" and Sare, together with the two Spanish communes of Zugarramurdi and Urdazubi, form a cross-border territory, called \"Xareta\". Straddling the border with Spain, it is a passage for the Way of St. James (\"Baztan way\") from Bayonne to Pamplona.\nThe commune's border with Spain is in the Dancharia area and accesses the area of Dantxarinea d'Urdazubi.\n\nThe commune is connected to Espelette in the north-east by Highway D20 which passes through the village and continues south to the Spanish border. Highway D305 branches west off the D20 and continues west to join Highway D4 before \"Cherchebruit\". A network of small country roads covers all parts of the commune.\n\nLocated in the watershed of the Adour, the Nivelle river runs along the southern border and forms the border between France and Spain. Numerous streams arise in the commune and flow down to the Nivelle including the Opalazioko erreka, the Lapitxuri and its tributaries, the Larreko erreka, the Erdiko erreka, the Farendeiko erreka, the Haitzagerriko erreka, and the Barretako erreka. Paul Raymond mentions the \"Haïçaguerry\", a tributary of the Nivelle, which descended to Gorospila on the Spanish border, and which crossed the territory of \"Ainhoue\" (the old spelling of Ainhoa).\n\n\nThe commune name in basque is the same - \"Ainhoa\".\n\nBrigitte Jobbé-Duval suggested that the name could come from the Basque \"aino\" which means \"goat\".\n\nThe following table details the origins of the commune name and other names in the commune.\n\nSources:\n\nOrigins:\n\nThe ancient redoubt of \"Urrizti\" reflects the ancient past of the area.\n\nPaul Raymond noted on page 4 of his 1863 dictionary that the parish of Ainhoa \"was in the gift of the Abbot of Urdax (Spain)\". The Curacy of Ainhoa was created by the Priory of the Premonstratensian of Urdazubi in the 13th century.\nOn 27 April 1238 the new king Theobald I of Navarre purchased the toll rights formerly instituted by Viscount Juan Pérez de Baztan, Ainhoa being then at the borders between the Duchy of Aquitaine since 1151, run by the Angevin Kings of England and the Navarrese kingdom.\n\nSuch tolls were charged to pilgrims and traders traveling to Santiago de Compostela on the Way of St. James in Galicia, Spain. Military clashes between the \"English run\" Basques of Aquitaine and the Navarrese in 1249 led the Seigneur of Ainhoa, in 1250, to recognize the suzerainty of King Henry III of England. By 1265 Gonzalvo Juanis, Seigneur of Ainhoa, also known as Gonzalvo Ibáñez or Gonzalvo Yáñes, did not recognize either the English or the Navarrese. However he died in 1289 and opened the way to conquest based on old historical claims. Then, Garda Arnaut de Espelette, with loyalty to the \"English run\" Basques of the Duchy of Aquitaine, sent a letter, dated 29 July 1289 praying the Ainhoa people to adequately connive with him. The outcome of such frontier business was to set up an \"undivided\" land as had been done also previously with the nearby Aldudes close to the Baztan valley.\n\nDocuments from Estella dated September 1369, some 80 years later, proved that the people from Ainhoa paid taxes to both the King of Navarre and the \"English\" Seneschal of the Landes territory in return for their fiscal and personal privileges.\n\nWhen \"English run\" Bayonne surrendered to the French in 1451 it is not known if these \"undivided status\" villages on the English-Navarrese frontier were taken by the French as well.\n\nIn the Spanish Invasion of 1636 in the Labourd territories many villages, including Ainhoa, were razed. Later, probably because of the 1659 \"Treaty of the Pyrénées\" whereby the Spanish-born Queen regent of France Anne of Austria with the help of Cardinal Mazarin, the First Minister of France, set up an advantageous (for the French) peace and also obtained Maria Theresa of Spain as a wife for her son Louis XIV of France. Ainhoa was then repopulated again.\n\nDisputes between the new settlers and the old residents concerning the use of communal lands for cattle grazing and fodder and the access by newcomers to town hall positions, schooling, church grants, etc. had to be settled by the then autonomous Parliament of Bordeaux in the sense of paying for access to village privileges.\n\nAinhoa was destroyed during the Thirty Years War (1618-1648) and then rebuilt. The only remains from before the destruction are the church and the Machitorénéa House.\n\nIn 1724, following the revolts in Saint-Jean-le-Vieux (1685) Mouguerre and Saint-Pierre-d'Irube (1696), the people of \"Ainhoa\" revolted against the salt tax and against other new taxes. This was a prelude to the uprisings in all of Labourd in 1726 against the said taxes. Bayonne and Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port followed in 1748.\n\nThe Law of 4 March 1790 determined a new administrative landscape of France by creating departments and districts. This resulted in the creation of the department of Basses-Pyrénées and reuniting the Béarn, the Gascon lands of Bayonne and Bidache, and the three French Basque provinces. For the latter, three districts were created: Mauleon, Saint-Palais, and Ustaritz which replaced the Bailiwick of Labourd. The seat of Ustaritz was transferred almost immediately to Bayonne. Its Director persuaded a large number of municipalities to adopt new names conforming to the spirit of the Revolution. So \"Ainhoa\" was called \"Mendiarte\", Ustaritz became \"Marat-sur-Nive\", Itxassou became \"Union\", Arbonne became \"Constante\", Saint-Étienne-de-Baïgorry became \"Thermopyles\", Saint-Palais became \"Mont-Bidouze\", Louhossoa became \"Montagne-sur-Nive\", Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port became \"Nive-Franche\", Saint-Jean-de-Luz became \"Chauvin-Dragon\" (the name of a young soldier killed in action), and Souraïde became \"Mendialde\".\n\nIn 1794, at the height of the Terror and after the desertion of forty seven young people from Itxassou, the Committee of Public Safety (Decree of 13 Ventôse Year II - 3 March 1794) arrested and deported some of the inhabitants (men, women and children) of Ainhoa, Ascain, Espelette, Itxassou, Sare, and Souraïde and decreed that these communes like the other communes of the Spanish border were \"infamous communes\". This was extended to Biriatou, Cambo-les-Bains, Larressore, Louhossoa, Mendionde, and Macaye.\n\nThe people were \"united in various national houses, or in the district of Ustaritz or in the Great Redoubt, like Jean-Jacques Rousseau\". In reality, they were gathered together in churches and then deported in very precarious conditions in Bayonne, Capbreton, Saint-Vincent-de-Tyrosse, and Ondres.\nThe Departments where people from the communes were interned were the Lot, the Lot-et-Garonne, the Gers, the Landes, the Basses-Pyrenees (partly béarnaise), and Hautes-Pyrenees.\n\nThe return of exiles and the recovery of their possessions were determined by a series of decrees issued on 29 September and 1 October 1794, driven in this direction by the Director of Ustaritz who said: \"The onetime communes of Sare, Itxassou, Ascain, Biriatou, and Serres, whose inhabitants were interned eight months ago as a measure of general safety, have not been improved. The people who come to obtain freedom to retire to their homes, clamour for food without my being able to procure the means to meet this primary human need, hunger.\". The recovery of their possessions was not without difficulty, they were placed in receivership but were not registered and were looted: \"The property, movable and immovable, of the inhabitants of Sare, were neither recorded nor legally described, and all our furniture and household effects were removed and brought confusedly to neighbouring communes. Instead of being put in safe places, some were sold at auction and sometimes sold without auction.\".\n\nDuring the retreat of the Napoleonic Army from Spain in 1813, Labourd villages were again submitted to abuse by the Confederate British and Spanish troops.\n\nUnder the German occupation of France during World War II many of these frontier villages were fully administered by the German military, but were also an escape route for British soldiers, French Resistance members, and European Jews trying to reach non-belligerent Spain.\n\nList of Successive Mayors of Ainhoa\n\nAinhoa is one of seven intercommunal organisations:\n\nThe commune is part of the urban area of Bayonne.\n\nIron ore was mined until the 19th century. Its initial operation was by the Premonstratensian of Saint-Sauveur of Urdax.\nThe weaving of flax (\"tisserands\") and wool (\"duranguiers\") persists in Ainhoa where in Hasparren it was an important activity until the advent of the textile industry in the 19th century.\n\nPhilippe Veyrin noted the existence of a factory making \"chahako\", small goatskins from male goats which peasants use for work or hunting. Ainhoa is part of the Appellation zone (AOC) for the production of pimentos of Espelette and also the AOC of the Ossau-iraty. The activities in the commune are mainly agricultural and forestry (500 hectares of forest over an area of 1619 hectares). A quarry is always operating in the municipality.\n\nThe town has received an award from the \"Most beautiful villages in France\", an award from an independent organization to promote the tourist attractions of small communes rich with quality heritage.\n\nAccording to the \"Map of the Seven Basque Provinces\" by Prince Louis-Lucien Bonaparte published in 1863, the dialect of Basque spoken in Ainhoa is \"labourdin\".\n\nThe village is laid out as a fortified town, with concealed labourdine houses from the 17th century and a fronton open square against the cemetery surrounding the church.\n\nThe cemetery contains Hilarri from the 16th and 17th centuries.\n\nAinhoa Forest stretches over 400 hectares and is home to a rich fauna of both wild animals (deer, wild boar, hares, and migratory birds) and semi-wild pastoral animals (pottoks, \"bestisos\", and goats). The forest consists mainly of oak trees, rustic essence and newer vegetation such as red American oak and softwood).\n\nPelota is played in the Fronton in the village and the covered fronton at \"Ur Hegian\".\n\nThe town has a public primary school.\n\nTwo GPs are present in the town.\n\n\n\n"}

Managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), it is a series of badland areas characterized by rock outcroppings, steep bluffs, and grassy plains; a topography referred to as \"The Breaks\" by locals (as the land appears to \"break away\" to the river).\n\nCreated by proclamation in 2001 by President Bill Clinton on January 17, it encompasses , most of which were already managed by the federal government. The adjacent Missouri River was designated a Wild and Scenic River in 1976 and forms a western boundary while the Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge is to the east. The Breaks country was a model for many of the paintings done by painter Charles M. Russell.\n\nFrench trappers found the area in the late 18th century peopled by Native American tribes such as the Blackfoot, Northern Cheyenne, Sioux, Assiniboine, Gros Ventre (Atsina), Crow, Plains Cree, and Plains Ojibwa. (The Crow name is \"Xuáhcheesh Annáppiio\", \"Where the Crow warrior Skunk was killed.\")\n\nThe Lewis and Clark Expedition passed through the Breaks in 1805 and were the first to document the region through notes and drawings, and their sighting and documentation of bighorn sheep in the Breaks region was the first time this species was recorded in North America by white explorers. Much of the Breaks region has remained as it was when Lewis and Clark's party first saw it. The confluence of the Judith and Missouri Rivers was the setting for important peace councils in 1846 and 1855.\n\nIn 1877, the eastbound Nez Perce crossed the Missouri and entered the Breaks country in their attempt to escape to Canada. The Cow Island Skirmish occurred in the Breaks and was the last encounter prior to the Nez Perce's surrender to the U.S. Army at the Battle of Bear Paw, just north of the monument.\" \nA full management plan is still under development due to various private inholdings and lease agreements between private citizens and the federal government. While conservationists would like to see some of the Breaks monument lands become designated as Wilderness, local ranchers and farmers under long standing lease agreements with the federal government, who graze upwards of 10,000 head of cattle annually within the new monument, are concerned that the monument status may adversely affect their livelihood and the economies of local towns.\n\nUnder the proposed management plan from the Department of the Interior, although the resources of the monument will be given better protection, \"currently permitted livestock grazing, hunting, fishing, and similar activities will generally not be affected, nor will private property (approximately ) and state land (approximately ) within the boundary of the proposed monument, as well as other valid existing rights.\"\n\nIn 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that the BLM's management plan violated historic site laws with their practices. The National Trust for Historic Preservation cited the site as one of ten historic sites saved in 2013.\n\nThe Breaks is home to at least sixty mammal species and hundreds of bird species. Willows and shrubs are found along the Missouri River banks while sagebrush and short grass prairie are dominant elsewhere.\n\n\n"}

A graduate of Balliol College, Krishna Varma was a noted scholar in Sanskrit and other Indian languages. He pursued a brief legal career in India and served as the \"Divan\" of a number of Indian princely states in India. He had, however, differences with Crown authority, was dismissed following a supposed conspiracy of local British officials at Junagadh and chose to return to England. An admirer of Dayanand Saraswati's approach of cultural nationalism, and of Herbert Spencer, Krishna Varma believed in Spencer's dictum: \"Resistance to aggression is not simply justified, but imperative\".\n\nIn 1905 he founded the India House and \"The Indian Sociologist\", which rapidly developed as an organised meeting point for radical nationalists among Indian students in Britain at the time and one of the most prominent centres for revolutionary Indian nationalism outside India. Krishna Varma moved to Paris in 1907, avoiding prosecution.\n\nShyamji Krishna Varma was born on 4 October 1857 in Mandvi, Cutch State (now Kutch, Gujarat) as Shamji, the son of Krushnadas Bhanushali (Karsan Nakhua; Nakhua is the surname while Bhanushali is the community name), a labourer for cotton press company, and Gomatibai, who died when Shyamji was only 11 years old. He was raised by his grandmother. His ancestors belonged to Bhachunda (23°12'3\"N 69°0'4\"E), a village now in Abdasa taluka of Kutch district. They had migrated to Mandvi in search of employment and due to familial disputes. After completing secondary education in Bhuj he went to Mumbai for further education at Wilson High School. Whilst in Mumbai, he learned Sanskrit.\n\nIn 1875, Shyamji married Bhanumati, a daughter of a wealthy businessman of the Bhatia community and sister of his school friend Ramdas. Then he got in touch with the nationalist Swami Dayananda Saraswati, a radical reformer and an exponent of the Vedas, who had founded the Arya Samaj. He became his disciple and was soon conducting lectures on Vedic philosophy and religion. In 1877, a public speaking tour secured him a great public recognition. He became the first non-Brahmin to receive the prestigious title of Pandit by the Pandits of Kashi in 1877. He came to the attention of Monier Williams, an Oxford professor of Sanskrit who offered Shyamji a job as his assistant.\n\nShyamji arrived in England and joined Balliol College, Oxford on 25 April 1879 with the recommendation of Professor Monier Williams. Passing his B.A. in 1883, he presented a lecture on \"the origin of writing in India\" to the Royal Asiatic Society. The speech was very well received and he was elected a non-resident member of the society. In 1881 he represented India at the Berlin Congress of Orientalists.\n\nHe returned to India in 1885 and started practice as a lawyer. Then he was appointed as Diwan (chief minister) by the King of Ratlam State; but ill health forced him to retire from this post with a lump sum gratuity of RS 32052 for his service. After a short stay in Mumbai, he settled in Ajmer, headquarters of his Guru Swami Dayananda Saraswati, and continued his practice at the British Court in Ajmer. He invested his income in three cotton presses and secured sufficient permanent income to be independent for the rest of his life. He served for the Maharaja of Udaipur as a council member from 1893 to 1895, followed by the position of Diwan of Junagadh State. He resigned in 1897 after a bitter experience with a British agent that shook his faith in British Rule.\n\nHaving read \"Satyarth Prakash\" and other books of Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Shyamji Krishna Varma was very much impressed with his philosophy, writings and spirit of Nationalism and had become one of his ardent admirers. It was upon Dayanand's inspiration, he set up a base in England at India House where were produced many revolutionaries like Madam Cama, Veer Savarkar, Lala Hardyal and Madan Lal Dhingra. Shyamji Krishan was also an admirer of Lokmanya Tilak and supported him during the Age of Consent bill controversy of 1890. However, he rejected the petitioning, praying, protesting, cooperating and collaborating policy of the Congress Party, which he considered undignified and shameful. In 1897, following the atrocities inflicted by the British government during the plague crisis in Poona, he supported the assassination of the Commissioner of Plague by the Chapekar brothers but he soon decided to fight for Indian Independence in Britain.\n\nOrdained by Swami Dayanand Saraswati the founder of Arya samaj, Shyamji Krishan Verma upon his arrival in London stayed at the Inner Temple and studied Herbert Spencer's writings in his spare time. In 1900 he bought an expensive house in Highgate. His home became a base for all political leaders of India. Lokmanya Tilak, Lala Lajpat Rai, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Gandhi, Lenin etc., all visited him to discuss the Indian Independence Movement. Avoiding the Indian National Congress, he kept in contact with rationalists, free thinkers, national and social democrats, socialists, Irish republicans, etc.\n\nHe was much inspired by Herbert Spencer's writings. At Spencer's funeral in 1903, he announced the donation of £1,000 to establish a lectureship at University of Oxford in tribute to him and his work. A year later he announced that Herbert Spencer Indian fellowships of RS 2000 each were to be awarded to enable Indian graduates to finish their education in England. He had also announced additional fellowship in memory of the late Dayananda Saraswati, the founder of Arya Samaj, along with another four fellowships in the future.\n\nIn 1905, Shyamji focused his activity as a political propagandist and organiser for the complete independence of India. Shyamji made his debut in Indian politics by publishing the first issue of his English monthly, \"The Indian Sociologist,\" an organ and of political, social and religious reform. This was an assertive, ideological monthly aimed at inspiring mass opposition to British rule, which stimulated many intellectuals to fight for the independence of India.\n\nOn 18 February 1905, Shyamji inaugurated a new organisation called The Indian Home Rule Society. The first meeting, held at his Highgate home, unanimously decided to found The Indian Home Rule Society with the object of:\n\nAs many Indian students faced racist attitudes when seeking accommodations, he founded India House as a hostel for Indian students, based at 65, Cromwell Avenue, Highgate. This living accommodation for 25 students was formally inaugurated on 1 July by Henry Hyndman, of the Social Democratic Federation, in the presence of Dadabhai Naoroji, Lala Lajpat Rai, Madam Cama, Mr. Swinney (of the London Positivist Society), Mr. Harry Quelch (the editor of the Social Democratic Federation's \"Justice\") and Charlotte Despard, the Irish Republican and suffragette. Declaring India House open, Hyndman remarked, \"As things stands, loyalty to Great Britain means treachery to India. The institution of this India House means a great step in that direction of Indian growth and Indian emancipation, and some of those who are here this afternoon may live to witness the fruits of its triumphant success.\" Shyamji hoped India House would incubate Indian revolutionaries and Bhikaiji Cama, S. R. Rana, Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, Virendranath Chattopadhyaya, and Lala Hardayal were all associated with it.\n\nLater in 1905, Shyamji attended the United Congress of Democrats held at Holborn Town Hall as a delegate of the India Home Rule Society. His resolution on India received an enthusiastic ovation from the entire conference. Shyamji’s activities in England aroused the concern of the British government: He was disbarred from Inner Temple and removed from the membership list on 30 April 1909 for writing anti-British articles in \"The Indian Sociologist\". Most of the British press were anti–Shyamji and carried outrageous allegations against him and his newspaper. He defended them boldly. \"The Times\" referred to him as the \"Notorious Krishnavarma\". Many newspapers criticised the British progressives who supported Shyamji and his view. His movements were closely watched by British Secret Services, so he decided to shift his headquarters to Paris, leaving India House in charge of Vir Savarkar. Shyamji left Britain secretly before the government tried to arrest him.\n\nHe arrived in Paris in early 1907 to continue his work. The British government tried to have him extradited from France without success as he gained the support of many top French politicians. Shyamji’s name was dragged into the sensational trial of Mr Merlin, an Englishman, at Bow Street Magistrates' Court, for writing an article in \"liberators\" published by Shyamji’s friend, Mr. James.\n\nShyamji's work in Paris helped gain support for Indian Independence from European countries. He agitated for the release of Savarker and acquired great support all over Europe and Russia. Guy Aldred wrote an article in the \"Daily Herald\" under the heading of \"Savarker the Hindu Patriot whose sentences expire on 24 December 1960\", helping create support in England, too. In 1914 his presence became an embarrassment as French politicians had invited King George V to Paris to set a final seal on the Entente Cordiale. Shyamji foresaw this and shifted his headquarters to Geneva. Here the Swiss government imposed political restrictions during the entire period of World War I. He kept in touch with his contacts, but he could not support them directly. He spent time with Dr. Briess, president of the Pro India Committee in Geneva, whom he later discovered was a paid secret agent of the British government.\n\nHe offered a sum of 10,000 francs to the League of Nations to endow a lectureship to be called the President Woodrow Wilson Lectureship for the discourse on the best means of acquiring and safe guarding national independence consistently with freedom, justice, and the right of asylum accorded to political refugees. It is said that the league rejected his offer due to political pressure from British government. A similar offer was made to the Swiss government which was also turned down. He offered another lectureship at the banquet given by Press Association of Geneva where 250 journalists and celebrities, including the presidents of Swiss Federation and the League of Nations. Shyamji’s offer was applauded on the spot but nothing came of it. Shyamji was disappointed with the response and he published all his abortive correspondence on this matter in the next issue of the \"Sociologist\" appearing in December 1920, after a lapse of almost six years.\n\nHe published two more issues of \"Indian Sociologist\" in August and September 1922, before ill health prevented him continuing. He died in hospital at 11:30 pm on 30 March 1930 leaving his wife, Bhanumati Krishnavarma.\n\nNews of his death was suppressed by the British government in India. Nevertheless, tributes were paid to him by Bhagat Singh and other inmates in Lahore Jail where they were undergoing a long-term drawn-out trial. \"Maratha\", an English daily newspaper started by Bal Gangadhar Tilak paid tribute to him.\n\nHe had made prepaid arrangements with the local government of Geneva and St Georges cemetery to preserve his and his wife’s ashes at the cemetery for 100 years and to send their urns to India whenever it became independent during that period. Requested by Paris-based scholar Dr Prithwindra Mukherjee, the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi agreed to repatriate the ashes. Finally on 22 August 2003, the urns of ashes of Shyamji and his wife Bhanumati were handed over to then Chief Minister of Gujarat State Narendra Modi by the Ville de Genève and the Swiss government 55 years after Indian Independence. They were brought to Mumbai and after a long procession throughout Gujarat, they reached Mandvi, his birthplace. A memorial called \"Kranti Teerth\" dedicated to him was built and inaugurated in 2010 near Mandvi. Spread over 52 acres, the memorial complex houses a replica of India House building at Highgate along with statues of Shyamji Krishna Varma and his wife. Urns containing Krishna Verma's ashes, those of his wife, and a gallery dedicated to earlier activists of Indian independence movement is housed within the memorial. Krishna Verma was disbarred from the Inner Temple in 1909. This decision was revisited in 2015, and a unanimous decision taken to posthumously reinstated him.\n\nIn the 1970s, a new town developed in his native state of Kutch, was named after him as Shyamji Krishna Varmanagar in his memory and honor. India Post released postal stamps and first day cover commemorating him. Kuchchh University was renamed after him.\n\nThe India Post has issued a postal stamp on shyamji Krishna Varma on 4 October 1989.\n"}

{"id": "2148918", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2148918", "title": "Anionic addition polymerization", "text": "Anionic addition polymerization\n\nAnionic addition polymerization is a form of chain-growth polymerization or addition polymerization that involves the polymerization of monomers initiated with anions. The type of reaction has many manifestations, but traditionally vinyl monomers are used. Often anionic polymerization involves living polymerizations, which allows control of structure and composition. \n\nAs early as 1936, Karl Ziegler proposed that anionic polymerization of styrene and butadiene by consecutive addition of monomer to an alkyl lithium initiator occurred without chain transfer or termination. Twenty years later, living polymerization was demonstrated by Szwarc and coworkers. In one of the breakthrough events in the field of polymer science, Szwarc elucidated that electron transfer occurred from radical anion of naphthalene to styrene. The results in the formation of a dianion (or equivalently disodio-) species, which rapidly added styrene to form a \"two – ended living polymer.\" An important aspect of his work, Szwarc employed the aprotic solvent tetrahydrofuran. Being a physical chemist, Szwarc elucidated the kinetics and the thermodynamics of the process in considerable detail. At the same time, he explored the structure property relationship of the various ion pairs and radical ions involved. This work provided the foundations for the rational synthesis of polymers with control over molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, and the architecture of the polymer.\n\nThe use of alkali metals to initiate polymerization of 1,3-dienes led to the discovery by Stavely and co-workers at Firestone Tire and Rubber company of cis-1,4-polyisoprene. This sparked the development of commercial anionic polymerization processes that utilize alkyllithium initiatiors.\n\nTwo broad classes of monomers are susceptible to anionic polymerization.\n\nVinyl monomers have the formula CH=CHR, the most important are styrene (R= CH), butadiene (CH=CH), and isoprene (R = C(Me)=CH). A second major class of monomers are acrylate esters, such as acrylonitrile, methacrylate, cyanoacrylate, and acrolein. Other vinyl monomers include vinylpyridine, vinyl sulfone, vinyl sulfoxide, vinyl silanes.\nMany cyclic compounds are susceptible to ring-opening polymerization. Epoxides, cyclic trisiloxanes, some lactones, lactides, cyclic carbonates, and amino acid N-carboxyanhydrides.\n\nIn order for polymerization to occur with vinyl monomers, the substituents on the double bond must be able to stabilize a negative charge. Stabilization occurs through delocalization of the negative charge. Because of the nature of the carbanion propagating center, substituents that react with bases or nucleophiles either must not be present or be protected.\n\nInitiators is selected based on the reactivity of the monomers. Highly electrophilic monomers such as cyanoacrylates require only weakly nucleophilic initiators, such as amines, phosphines, or even halides. Less reactive monomers such as styrene require powerful nucleophiles such as butyl lithium. Reaction of intermediate strength are used for monomers of intermediate reactivity such as vinylpyridine.\n\nThe solvent used in anionic addition polymerizations are determined by the reactivity of both the initiator and nature of the propagating chain end. Anionic species with low reactivity, such as heterocyclic monomers, can use a wide range of solvents.\n\nInitiation of styrene polymerization with sodium naphthalene proceeds by electron transfer from the naphthalene radical anion to the monomer. The resulting radical dimerizes to give a dilithio compound, which then functions as the initiator. Polar solvents are necessary for this type of initiation both for stability of the anion-radical and to solvate the cation species formed. The anion-radical can then transfer an electron to the monomer. \nInitiation can also involve the transfer of an electron from the alkali metal to the monomer to form an anion-radical. Initiation occurs on the surface of the metal, with the reversible transfer of an electron to the adsorbed monomer.\n\nNucleophilic initiators include covalent or ionic metal amides, alkoxides, hydroxides, cyanides, phosphines, amines and organometallic compounds (alkyllithium compounds and Grignard reagents). The initiation process involves the addition of a neutral (B:) or negative (B:-) nucleophile to the monomer.\nThe most commercially useful of these initiators has been the alkyllithium initiators. They are primarily used for the polymerization of styrenes and dienes.\n\nMonomers activated by strong electronegative groups may be initiated even by weak anionic or neutral nucleophiles (i.e. amines, phosphines). Most prominent example is the curing of cyanoacrylate, which constitutes the basis for superglue. Here, only traces of basic impurities are sufficient to induce an anionic addition polymerization or zwitterionic addition polymerization, respectively.\n\nPropagation in anionic addition polymerization results in the complete consumption of monomer. This stage is often fast, even at low temperatures.\n\nLiving anionic polymerization is a living polymerization technique involving an anionic propagating species.\n\nLiving anionic polymerization was demonstrated by Szwarc and co workers in 1956. Their initial work was based on the polymerization of styrene and dienes. \nOne of the remarkable features of living anionic polymerization is that the mechanism involves no formal termination step. In the absence of impurities, the carbanion would still be active and capable of adding another monomer. The chains will remain active indefinitely unless there is inadvertent or deliberate termination or chain transfer. This gave rise to two important consequences:\n\n\nThe following experimental criteria have been proposed as a tool for identifying a system as living polymerization system.\nHowever, in practice, even in the absence of terminating agents, the concentration of the living anions will reduce with time due to a decay mechanism termed as spontaneous termination.\n\nSynthesis of block copolymers is one of the most important applications of living polymerization as it offers the best control over structure. The nucleophilicity of the resulting carbanion will govern the order of monomer addition, as the monomer forming the less nucleophilic propagating species may inhibit the addition of the more nucleophilic monomer onto the chain. An extension of the above concept is the formation of triblock copolymers where each step of such a sequence aims to prepare a block segment with predictable, known molecular weight and narrow molecular weight distribution without chain termination or transfer.\n\nSequential monomer addition is the dominant method, also this simple approach suffers some limitations.</ref>\nMoreover, this strategy, enables synthesis of linear block copolymer structures that are not accessible via sequential monomer addition. For common A-b-B structures, sequential block copolymerization gives access to well defined\nblock copolymers only if the crossover reaction rate constant is significantly higher than the rate constant of the homopolymerization\nof the second monomer, i.e., k » k.\n\nOne of the remarkable features of living anionic polymerization is the absence of a formal termination step. In the absence of impurities, the carbanion would remains active, awaiting the addition of new monomer. Termination can occur through unintentional quenching by impurities, often present in trace amounts. Typical impurities include oxygen, carbon dioxide, or water. Termination intentionally allows the introduction of tailored end groups. \n\nLiving anionic polymerization allow the incorporation of functional end-groups, usually added to quench polymerization. End-groups that have been used in the functionalization of α-haloalkanes include hydroxide, -NH, -OH, -SH, -CHO,-COCH, -COOH, and epoxides. \n\nAn alternative approach for functionalizing end-groups is to begin polymerization with a functional anionic initiator. In this case, the functional groups are protected since the ends of the anionic polymer chain is a strong base. This method leads to polymers with controlled molecular weights and narrow molecular weight distributions.\n\n"}

The Olympic Village in Heidelberg West housed the thousands of athletes who participated in the 1956 Olympic Games.\n\nThe Division has always been a marginal-to-safe Labor seat. It was first held by Peter Staples, who served as a minister under Bob Hawke and Paul Keating. Staples retired in 1996 and was replaced by Jenny Macklin, who has held the seat prior to her retirement in 2018. Macklin served as Deputy Leader of the Australian Labor Party under Simon Crean, Mark Latham and Kim Beazley, as well as a minister under Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard. In 2018, Macklin announced her retirement from politics. Kate Thwaites replaced Macklin as Labor's candidate for the area and subsequently won the seat in the 2019 Australian federal election.\n\n"}
{"id": "2148933", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2148933", "title": "Social psychiatry", "text": "Social psychiatry\n\nSocial psychiatry is a branch of psychiatry that focuses on the interpersonal and cultural context of mental disorder and mental wellbeing. It involves a sometimes disparate set of theories and approaches, with work stretching from epidemiological survey research on the one hand, to an indistinct boundary with individual or group psychotherapy on the other. Social psychiatry combines a medical training and perspective with fields such as social anthropology, social psychology, cultural psychiatry, sociology and other disciplines relating to mental distress and disorder. Social psychiatry has been particularly associated with the development of therapeutic communities, and to highlighting the effect of socioeconomic factors on mental illness. Social psychiatry can be contrasted with biopsychiatry, with the latter focused on genetics, brain neurochemistry and medication. Social psychiatry was the dominant form of psychiatry for periods of the 20th century but is currently less visible than biopsychiatry. \n\nAfter reviewing the history and activities of social psychiatry, Vincenzo Di Nicola reviews three major questions for social psychiatry and concludes with a manifesto for a 21st century social psychiatry: \n\n\nThe events of the first half of the 20th century brought the issue of the relationship between the individual and the community to the fore. Psychiatrists who showed a willingness to confront these issues at home, after the war, called themselves social psychiatrists. Psychoanalytic psychotherapy and all its offshoots were grounded in an approach to the patient that focused almost exclusively on the individual—the relational aspects of therapy were implicit in the relationship between therapist and patient, but the main source of problem and motivation for change was seen as being intrapsychic (within the individual). The social and political contexts were largely disregarded. Sarason observed in 1981, that \"it is as though society does not exist for the psychologist. Society is a vague, amorphous background that can be disregarded in one's efforts to fathom the laws of behavior\" (Sarason 1981).\n\nEarly landmarks in social psychiatry included: Karen Horney, MD, who wrote about personality as it interacts with other people (1937); Erik Erikson, who discussed the influence of society on development (1950); Harry Stack Sullivan's (1953) integration of sociological and psychodynamic concepts, and his work on the role of early interpersonal interactions in the development of the self; Cornell University's Midtown Manhattan Study, which looked at the prevalence of mental illness in Manhattan; August Hollingshead, PhD, and Frederick Redlich, MD, looked at the influence of social class on psychiatric conditions (1958); Alexander H. Leighton, MD, looked at the relationship between social disintegration and mental illness (1959); Burrow was an early pioneer of the social causes of mental disorder and suggested \"Sociatry\" as the name for this new discipline.\n\nOver the years many sociologists have contributed theories and research which has enlightened psychiatry in this area (e.g. Avison and Robins); The relationship between social factors and mental illness was demonstrated by the early work of Hollingshead and Readlich in Chicago in the 1930s, who found a high concentration of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia in deprived areas of the city has been replicated numerous times throughout the world, although controversy still exists as to the extent of drift of vulnerable individuals to these areas or of a higher incidence of the disorder in the socially disadvantaged; the Midtown Manhattan Study conducted in the 1950s by Cornell University hinted at widespread psychopathology among the general population of New York City (Srole, Sanger, Michael, Opler, and Rennie, 1962); the Three Hospitals Study (Wing JK and Brown GW, Social Treatments of Chronic Schizophrenia: a comparative survey of three mental hospitals, 1961, Journal of Mental Science, 107, 847-861) was a very influential work that has been replicated, that demonstrated forcefully that the poverty of the environment in poor mental hospitals lead to greater handicaps in the patients.\n\nSocial psychiatry was instrumental in the development of therapeutic communities. Under the influence of Maxwell Jones, Main, Wilmer and others (Caudill 1958; Rapoport 1960), combined with the publications of critiques of the existing mental health system (Greenblatt et al. 1957, Stanton and Schwartz 1954) and the sociopolitical influences that permeated the psychiatric world, the concept of the therapeutic community and its attenuated form—the therapeutic milieu—caught on and dominated the field of inpatient psychiatry throughout the 1960s. The aim of therapeutic communities was a more democratic, user-led form of therapeutic environment, avoiding the authoritarian and demeaning practices of many psychiatric establishments of the time. The central philosophy is that clients are active participants in their own and each other's mental health treatment and that responsibility for the daily running of the community is shared among the clients and the staff. \"TCs\" have often eschewed or limited medication in favor of psychoanalytically-derived group-based insight therapies.\n\nSocial psychiatry can be most effectively applied in helping to develop mental health promotion and prevent certain mental illnesses by educating individuals, families, and societies.\n\nSocial psychiatry has been important in developing the concept of major \"life events\" as precipitants of mental ill health, including, for example, bereavement, promotion, moving house, or having a child.\n\nOriginally inpatient centers, many therapeutic communities now operate as day centers, often focused on borderline personality disorder and run by psychotherapists or art therapists rather than psychiatrists.\n\nSocial psychiatrists help test the cross-cultural use of psychiatric diagnoses and assessments of need or disadvantage, showing particular links between mental illness and unemployment, overcrowding and single parent families.\n\nSocial psychiatrists also work to link concepts such as self-esteem and self-efficacy to mental health, and in turn to socioeconomic factors.\n\nSocial psychiatrists work on social firms in regard to people with mental health problems. These are regular businesses in the market that employ a significant number of people with disabilities, who are paid regular wages and work on the basis of regular work contracts. There are approximately 2,000 social firms in Europe and a large percentage of people with disabilities who work in social firms have a psychiatric disability. Some are specifically for people with psychiatric disabilities.(Schwarz, G. & Higgins, G: Marienthal the social firms network Supporting the Development of Social Firms in Europe, UK, 1999)\n\nSocial psychiatrists often focus on rehabilitation in a social context, rather than \"treatment\" per se. A related approach is community psychiatry.\n\nFacilitating the social inclusion of people with mental health problems is a major focus of modern social psychiatry.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2148940", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2148940", "title": "Quentin Quire", "text": "Quentin Quire\n\nQuintavius Quirinius \"Quentin\" Quire, also known as Kid Omega, is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, usually in those featuring the X-Men. Quire first appeared in \"New X-Men\" #134 (January, 2003). He was created by writer Grant Morrison and artist Frank Quitely.\n\nQuire made his first appearance in \"New X-Men\" #134 (January 2003). His first appearance as Kid Omega and the first appearance of the Omega Gang were in \"New X-Men\" #135 (February 2003). Grant Morrison has cited The Sekhmet Hypothesis as an influence on the story as well as Quire's angry punk rock aesthetic, referring to it in his book, \"Supergods\".\n\nQuentin Quire joins the student body of the Xavier Institute after Professor X's return from averting a war with Genosha and the rebuilding of the X-Mansion. He immediately stands out as a brilliant intellect and quickly becomes Xavier's prize pupil. Xavier teaches Quire to control his powers when they first appear. The extent and type of his mutant abilities are never clearly defined. Quire appears to be a very powerful telepath, and the Stepford Cuckoos describe him as having a 'see-through mind', but he is not necessarily limited to that.\n\nQuentin often associates with Glob Herman and has a crush on Sophie, one of the Stepford Cuckoos. However, something about Quire disturbs the Cuckoos, though Emma Frost dismisses it as academic rivalry.\n\nWhile a student at Xavier's, Quire invents the anti-gravity floats for Martha Johansson's brain canister, and exposes the charisma-powered Slick's true, ugly body to the other students. On his birthday, Quentin receives a call from his parents, who tell him he was adopted. This seems to destabilize him. He goes to town, getting a haircut reminiscent of Bolivar Trask's depiction of a mutant overlord from a newspaper that was published the day Quire was born. Quire becomes strongly opposed to a policy of tolerance with humans, calling for vengeance for the recently murdered mutant designer Jumbo Carnation. He takes to wearing clothing based on the Trask mutant overlord illustration, which happens to be one of Jumbo's creations. He also debates with Professor X the merits of his dream of humans and mutants living in peace, and the school policies based on this idea. He questions whether Xavier would allow any dream other than his own to exist.\n\nShortly afterward, Quire and a group of like-minded students visit town wearing the Trask-overlord clothes, and Quire convinces them to take the mutant drug Kick. They accost a gang of humans in an alley and kill or maim them all. When Herman asks what had happened to a human Quentin himself had murdered, Quire replies he had carved his name across the man's mind. Back at school, Xavier confronts the students, but Quire is not implicated. Quire and his gang later go to a mutant tattooist and have their arms marked with an Omega symbol over an X, then attack U-Men Central. Returning to school, the \"Omega Gang\" ambushes Professor X with a baseball bat and clamps his head in a thought-proof helmet. The next day, at the school's \"Open Day\" to parents and the media, Quire publicly proclaims it is \"open season on humans\" and starts a riot.\n\nSome of the students join Quire in protesting Xaviers' policies, but most of the damage is done by the Omegas themselves. They are finally subdued by Beast, Cyclops, Emma Frost and Xorn. However, with Quire still guarding Professor X, the situation threatens to continue. Quire even mentally subdues Wolverine with a memory of his past life. Xavier eventually frees himself of the helmet and confronts Quentin, calling his thought-proof helmet and his plans of revolution \"flimsy\". However, the altercation is not officially ended until the Stepford Cuckoos, led by Sophie, use Cerebra and a dose of mutant drug Kick to boost their shared powers. They blast through to the grounds and confront Quire, who confesses that his motivation for the ordeal was to impress Sophie, to whom he is attracted. This uniformly disgusts the Cuckoos, who mock his motivations and defeat him with a massive telepathic shockwave. Disoriented, Quentin apologizes. He confesses that he started everything not only because of his desire to impress Sophie, but also because of his own disrupted sense of identity upon discovering he was adopted. Emma Frost chastises him for his recklessness, as she reveals the now deceased Sophie in her arms. After discovering this revelation and overloading on his own abilities, Quire immediately enters a catatonic state.\n\nQuire is taken to the Infirmary, where Henry McCoy tries to stabilize him, but his body is being burnt out by his own psionic energy. This is apparently the result of his overdoses of Kick, which cause a secondary mutation that changes his brain into faster-than-light energy. Apparently this simultaneously puts him in telepathic contact with everyone on the planet across time. Seeing that Quire is terminal, Professor X calls for Xorn. He opens his helmet to expose Quire to the mini star in his head, and Quire \"left the mortal plane\". Quire's final words when Xorn \"heals\" him are vaguely prophetic of many of the coming events in Morrison's final run of New X-Men. This includes the foreshadowing of events such as Xorn later being revealed to be Magneto, Xorn's eventual destruction of Manhattan, and the actions of Sublime, a bacterial entity that claims to be the cause of some of the human/mutant hatred and aggression occurring. The incident forces the Professor to resign as headmaster, leaving Jean Grey to lead the school and X-Men.\n\nHowever, Quire is not truly dead and Professor Xavier announces to the student body that he believes Quire has ascended to a higher plane of existence. Quentin remains in a dormant, semi-alive, energy form in a containment unit on Beast's lab table. The potential future shown in the \"New X-Men\" story \"Here Comes Tomorrow\" indicated that Quentin is destined to become an avatar for the Phoenix Force. A young boy, wearing a Phoenix costume and Quentin's distinct pink haircut, is seen telling Jean Grey, who vaguely recognizes him, that she doesn't have long to set the events in the timeline right.\n\nA few months later in \"\", when a fragment of the shattered Phoenix Force returns to Earth, it senses Quire and investigates him, thinking he might be Jean Grey. Though the Phoenix passes up Quire, it shocks him back to consciousness and he reconstitutes his body. Furthermore, he seeks out and reanimates Sophie's corpse, but is unable to complete the process, so he sets off to find the Phoenix Force so he can be with his love. Quire finds the Phoenix, which has resurrected Jean Grey to attract Cyclops' attention, engaged in battle with the X-Men. Just prior to his arrival on the scene, the X-Men get the Phoenix to inhabit Emma Frost, Cyclops's current lover, and imprisons both her and Scott inside a containment vessel. Quire arrives and breaks the containment chamber open, releasing the Phoenix fragment. Quentin then asks the Phoenix to resurrect Sophie, which it does. Sophie is still disgusted by him (and/or his actions) and chooses to return to death. Quire breaks down in anguish, and the Phoenix leaves him to his \"sickness\". Having spent too much of his energy, Quire apologizes to the X-Men for his rash behavior and returns to his non-corporeal state in the container in Beast's lab.\n\nBeast brings Quentin's container to his lab on Utopia after the X-Mansion is abandoned. Finding life on a higher plane to be \"boring,\" Quentin revives himself and decides to become a villain and secretly destroy Utopia, claiming that the X-Men stole his idea to create a mutant nation. He elects to make his endeavor a game and selects Martha (a disembodied mutant brain with telepathic abilities living in a life support container) to be his nemesis, giving her seven and a half minutes to stop him. Martha attempts to alert the X-Men and locate Quentin, but he intercepts and taunts her at each attempt, ultimately smashing her container and leaving her to die. Martha realizes that Quentin has infiltrated Cerebra in order to destroy the island and take revenge on the Stepford Cuckoos by putting them in a mental loop. Martha breaks the Cuckoos free, and they quickly defeat Quire.\n\nQuire returns in the X-Men arc \"\", after being secretly broken out of the X-Men's prison by Kade Kilgore, the new Black King of the Hellfire Club. Thinking his containment unit just malfunctioned, Quire decides to celebrate his new freedom by infiltrating an international arms conference in Switzerland (where Scott Summers was to be giving a talk) and forcing the top leaders of the world to reveal their deepest, darkest secrets on camera. After this stunt, he becomes the most hunted mutant on Earth and seeks refuge on Utopia. Instead of handing him over to Captain Steve Rogers like Wolverine suggests, Cyclops orders that Quire be put back into containment so he can be tried by a jury of his peers after the trouble that Quire caused is resolved.\n\nAfter the events of \"Schism\", Quire is considered one of the world's worst terrorists. Feeling that jail would only make Quentin's sociopathic tendencies worse, Wolverine strikes a deal with Captain America. He is released into Wolverine's custody and Quire is to attend the newly reformed Jean Grey Institute for Higher Learning in an effort to rehabilitate him. Nobody consulted Cyclops on this.\n\nQuentin Quire is shown in promotional art for \"Wolverine and the X-Men\" #1 as a member of Wolverine's post-Schism team. In issue #3 of that series, Quire helps Wolverine's team by successfully reasoning with an offshoot of Krakoa. Later, while helping Wolverine con a \"space casino\" out of money needed for the school, Quire is able to manifest and use what he calls a \"psychic shotgun,\" which is very similar to the psychic swords used by characters like Psylocke.\n\nQuire faces off against Wolverine in a mental construct of his own devising in an attempt both to show Wolverine who is tougher and to punish him. This incident draws in Armor, a fellow student. Quire finds the effort extremely taxing to the point where he loses control of his own creation, leaving Wolverine's body a beastly, raging nightmare hellbent on killing Quentin. The limited series is titled \"Wolverine and the X-Men: Alpha & Omega\", which is written by Brian Wood.\n\nOver time, Quire begins to accept his fellow students by first helping them save the faculty after Frankenstein's Circus hypnotizes them against the student body, working as a team during a field trip to the Savage Land in which Wolverine's half-brother Dog Logan makes an unexpected appearance, and in \"A+X\", he assists Captain America in a mission against an army of MODOK clones as part of his punishment for what he did at the UN conference in Switzerland.\n\nDuring \"Infinity\", Quire is chosen as one of the few students to represent Wolverine's school in a friendly competition among similar schools for super-youngsters. This 'Contest of Champions' is attacked by an alien armada. Quire witnesses fellow student Crimson being flattened right next to him. Ultimately, Quire's telepathy is essential in the other students joining together to defeat an alien giant.\n\nAfter several members of the Jean Grey School defected to join the new Hellfire Academy, Quentin followed them, hoping to discover why Idie Okonkwo switched sides. After gaining entrance to the Hellfire Academy, it was discovered that Quentin did not change allegiances but was looking for Idie. This led to Quentin getting \"detention\", in which he was beaten, until Toad helped him escape his tormentors. While trying to escape, Quentin and Toad were confronted by the other students of the academy. Together with Idie and Wolverine's X-Men, they defeat the Hellfire Academy and he returns to the school. Quentin later graduates and becomes a graduate student/assistant at the school. In \"Battle of the Atom\", he comes face to face with his future Phoenix self and begins to question his stay at the school.\n\nDue to his anger towards Logan and others, Quire later breaks off association with the facility when he becomes independently wealthy and leaves the school to join the Phoenix Corporation, later becoming the new White King of the Hellfire Club. However, he finds himself not quite able to enjoy the riches and fame because he saw his own death on a time travel adventure. Wolverine and Iron Man try to bring Quire out of his self-imposed isolation but fail. The events of \"AXIS\" and Wolverine's death cause him to finally return to the Jean Grey School and help both the Avengers and X-Men battle Red Onslaught.\n\nWhen Kitty Pryde relocated the X-Men in New York and the school was renamed to Xavier Institute for Mutant Education and Outreach, Quentin was forced to join in. He became part of Jubilee's team, which consisted of Nathaniel Carver, Benjamin Deeds, Lin Li, Bling! and Eye-Boy. When a mysterious shadow in Central Park started stealing mutants during the night, Quentin convinced his classmates to investigate. They found themselves face-to-face with Emplate, who was possessing his sister Monet's body at the time. After defeating the Rat King, Quentin convinced Benjamin and Nathaniel to join him for a night out. They were stuck in a villain-infested auction, where they had to destroy a priceless weapon, all without getting caught by the auctioneer, Kade Kilgore.\n\nHaving become fed up with people, Quentin decided to exile himself from society and live in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean with Krakoa taking the shape of a small desert island. Quentin's little vacation was interrupted by Thor, who had been directed by Kid Gladiator and Warbird for help after a conflict with the Shi'ar escalated to a cosmic scale. Thor had been forced to compete against the Shi'ar gods K'ythri and Sharra in a contest to prove her godhood, and since they lost, the Shi'ar gods had conjured the Phoenix Force to have it lay waste to all of reality. Quentin psychically attacked the Phoenix, allowing Thor to access the White Hot Room and fight it. Quentin then used Thor's attacks as an opening to enter the White Hot Room himself and negotiate with the Phoenix. As a result of Quentin's proposition, the Phoenix allowed him to absorb a small portion of itself. In the end, K'ythri and Sharra were arrested and taken to Omnipotence City for their actions. As the Shi'ar were left without their gods, the newly Phoenix-empowered Quentin was proposed by Shadrak as a substitute to fill their role, and so became the New God of the Shi'ar as the Phoenix. This arrangement apparently didn't last, though, as Quentin appeared back on Earth and resumed his self-imposed exile on Krakoa.\n\nIn \"New X-Men\", Quire is depicted as an Omega level mutant possessing advanced cognitive and telepathic abilities that enable him to organize and construct his thoughts at accelerated rates, overtly or covertly manipulate the minds of others, resist mind probes, and disable other forms of psychic manipulation. His level of psychic influence on others depends on the number of individuals he wishes to affect — his influence is strongest among fewer individuals and subtler in large numbers of people. Xavier explains that Quentin's psychic powers are \"deep, subtle, and he's able to influence minds around him\". Emma Frost also states that his mind processes several thousand \"brilliant\" thoughts a second. Given that Quire is under the influence of the drug Kick for much of his time at the academy, it is unknown how much his power was being boosted by its effects. However, after the events of \"\", Quire is shown to have most of his telepathic and telekinetic powers still intact, even without Kick. His powers also seem to continue to develop, as Quire is able to manifest and use a \"psychic shotgun\", as well as other firearms and explosives, much in the same way other mutants (such as Psylocke) can manifest swords with their minds. He has also been shown to create an entire universe, which he calls \"The Construct\", within his mind, allowing him to imprison others within this world.\n\nIn the miniseries \"\", Quire generates massive amounts of telekinetic energy which manifest in the form of tentacles, allowing him to break free of his containment chamber, blast through the Xavier School's foundation, pull Sophie's body out of the ground, restructure it a bit, instantly heal wounds on his body inflicted through Wolverine's claws, and fly at supersonic speed.\n\nQuentin Quire has existed without a body as a form of energy inside a jar. He is also depicted as being an alternate reality host of the Phoenix Force in the White Hot Room, suggesting that he can potentially be a host to the Phoenix. Quentin is apparently destined to become a Phoenix Avatar in more than one reality as further revealed by the \"Battle of the Atom\" storyline, where an alternate future version of Quire is a member of the future X-Men as well as a Phoenix avatar, having taken the codename \"Phoenix\".\n\nThe Omega Gang is a group of teenage mutants and enemies of the X-Men. Created by comics writer Grant Morrison, the gang first appears in \"New X-Men\" #135 but is not named until \"New X-Men\" #140, when Lucas Bishop asks to interview them.\n\nThe Omega Gang is formed by Quentin Quire, a young telepath and one of the top students of the Xavier Institute. Quire has become depressed because of an unrequited crush on Sophie of the Stepford Cuckoos; his unpopular status among the Institute students; and especially the revelation that he was an adopted child, which shatters his already fragile self-esteem. The death of mutant fashion designer Jumbo Carnation prompts Quire to gather a small group of students to exact revenge on Carnation's murderers.\n\nAt Quire's request, all members tattoo themselves with a symbol formed by an Omega with an X below it and dress up with red-and-black striped shirts, jeans and whips. This is an outfit designed by Carnation himself and based on an illustration from an anti-mutant article written by Bolivar Trask many years ago, which portrayed mutants enslaving the human race. The Omega Gang members also consume the drug Kick in order to boost their powers. Unbeknownst to them, the drug is actually the aerosol form of the sentient bacteria Sublime, which seeks to increase the violence between mutants and baseline humans.\n\nThe gang is responsible for the attack on a teenage anti-mutant gang and later for the Open Day Riots. During the riots, Professor X is injured and Dummy of the Special Class, a gas-composed mutant, is seemingly destroyed when his containment suit is pierced. The most notable victim is Sophie of the Stepford Cuckoos, who dies in her heroic attempt to stop Quentin. The rest of the Gang is stopped by the efforts of the other X-Men.\n\nIn this harsh reality it is revealed that Quentin was examined by the Shadow King and found to be an unstable, mildly talented telepath with apparently no usefulness to Weapon Omega. Quentin finds a way to create a kind of \"psychic pyramid scheme\" known as the Overmind by using minor \"dreg\" telepaths, the Mind Dolls, and uses this to increase his own limited skills, something the Shadow King didn't expected or even dreamed off. Sensing the boy's growing mental abilities, the Shadow King puts a bounty on him.\n\nProphet, leader of a group of human freedom fighters, and Jean Grey tries to recruit him as an ally, however he takes instead Jean Grey into the mindscape and tries to force her into unleashing the Phoenix Force so he could increase more his own mental abilities, unaware that Jean had become powerless and the Phoenix Force has left her. Jean quickly understands that Quentin is losing control over his powers and is falling into madness. She tries to help him but at the end, he dies by turning a gun on himself to bring peace to his fractured mind.\n\nHis suicide appeared to be a ruse as he was later seen alive and well with the Overmind. He confronts the Shadow King in his penthouse apartment, where the Shadow King managed to easily kill the Mind Dolls, yet he finds himself unable to defeat Quentin who reveals himself to be actually Goodnight in disguise. As it turns out, Prophet had secretly cloned Quentin's powerful mutant brain in order to be used to trap the Shadow King. Unable to navigate Quentin's labyrinth of a mind, the Shadow King was successfully taken off the board before the final battle against Weapon Omega.\n\nIn \"Exiles: Days of Then and Now\", Quentin Quire is one of the surviving heroes during the Annihilation Wave. It is led to Earth by a banished Hulk, who has killed Annihilus. Quentin leads a group that includes Lightspeed, , Speedball, , and three of the Stepford Cuckoos: Sophie, Esme, and Mindee. Quentin has begun a relationship with Sophie, whose powers have changed to include limited precognition. After listening to Sophie's dream about a group of heroes that help restore order within damaged realities called the Exiles, Quentin goes on an interdimensional mission to find the original Exiles. Instead, he eventually recruits a group of heroes from the worlds he visits into a new group of Exiles. In the reality where he meets and recruits Nighthawk, he comes up against an alternate version of himself.\n\nIn the \"House of M\" storyline, Quentin, along with most of the \"New X-Men\" characters, appears as a student of the New Mutant Leadership Institute. Upon confronting the spying Wallflower and boasting that no one could stop his mind, Wallflower uses her pheromones to fill him with self-loathing, forcing him to commit mental suicide. In this version, Quentin retains his more clean-cut appearance.\n\nAn adult Quire is now host to the Phoenix Force. He returns to the now defunct Jean Grey School for Higher Learning to confront his nemesis, Wolverine. Backed up only by bamfs, Wolverine is confronted with Quire's newest surprise: two million Negative Zone mutants in need of schooling. However, Logan relishes his new-found role as teacher and welcomes them in.\n\nQuentin Quire has recently appeared in the Ultimate Universe, offering comfort and mind therapy to Rogue, who has been traumatised over all she has seen and done. He is also featured as a mutant under the care of Nick Fury.\n\nAn alternate version of Quentin briefly appears in the \"What If: Rise & Fall of the Shi'ar Empire\" one-shot. After Vulcan is transported into the White Hot Room, he tells Vulcan that he is not meant to be there. He is ultimately killed by Vulcan.\n\nA character called \"Kid Omega\" appears in the movie \"\", but is modeled after the character Quill rather than Quentin Quire. This was admitted as a typo in the commentary for the movie, where the character is instead referred to as \"Quill\". A character modeled after the character would later appear in \"\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2148941", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2148941", "title": "Four Symbols", "text": "Four Symbols\n\nThe Four Symbols (, literally meaning \"four images\"), are four mythological creatures appearing among the Chinese constellations along the ecliptic, and viewed as the guardians of the four cardinal directions. These four creatures are also referred to by a variety of other names, including \"Four Guardians\", \"Four Gods\", and \"Four Auspicious Beasts\". They are the Azure Dragon of the East, the Vermilion Bird of the South, the White Tiger of the West, and the Black Tortoise (also called \"Black Warrior\") of the North. Each of the creatures is most closely associated with a cardinal direction and a color, but also additionally represents other aspects, including a season of the year, a virtue, and one of the Chinese \"five elements\" (wood, fire, earth, metal, and water). Each has been given its own individual traits and origin story. Symbolically, and as part of spiritual and religious belief, these creatures have been culturally important across countries in the East Asian cultural sphere.\n\nDepictions of mythological creatures clearly ancestral to the modern set of four creatures have been found throughout China. Currently, the oldest known depiction was found in 1987 in a tomb in Xishuipo (西水坡) in Puyang, Henan, which has been dated to approximately 5300 BC. In the tomb, labeled M45, immediately adjacent to the remains of the main occupant to the east and west were found mosaics made of clam shells and bones forming images closely resembling the Azure Dragon and White Tiger, respectively.\n\nThe modern standard configuration was settled much later, with variations appearing throughout Chinese history. For example, the \"Rongcheng Shi\" manuscript recovered in 1994, which dates to the Warring States Period (ca. 453–221 BCE), gives five directions rather than four and places the animals differently. According to that document, Yu the Great gave directional banners to his people, marked with the following insignia: the north with a bird, the south with a snake, the east with the sun, the west with the moon, and the center with a bear.\n\nIn Taoism, the Four Symbols have been assigned human identities and names. The Azure Dragon is named Meng Zhang (), the Vermilion Bird is called Ling Guang (), the White Tiger Jian Bing (), and the Black Tortoise Zhi Ming ().\n\nThe colours associated with the four creatures can be said to match the colours of soil in the corresponding areas of China: the bluish-grey water-logged soils of the east, the reddish iron-rich soils of the south, the whitish saline soils of the western deserts, the black organic-rich soils of the north, and the yellow soils from the central loess plateau.\n\nThe Four Symbols are closely connected with the yin-yang philosophy. Fuxi explained the Four Symbols as one of the stages of the creation of the world, in the following way:\n\nThese mythological creatures have also been syncretized into the five principles system. The Azure Dragon of the East represents Wood, the Vermilion Bird of the South represents Fire, the White Tiger of the West represents Metal, and the Black Tortoise (or Dark Warrior) of the North represents Water. In this system, the fifth principle Earth is represented by the Yellow Dragon of the Center.\n\nThe four beasts each represent a season. The Azure Dragon of the East represents spring, the Vermilion Bird of the South represents summer, the White Tiger of the West represents autumn, and the Black Tortoise of the North represents winter.\n\n\n\n"}

A commander-in-chief of the Catholic and Royal Army at the age of 21, he is regarded as one of the most courageous officers in French military history.\n\nBorn in the Château de la Durbellière, Saint-Aubin-de-Baubigné, near Châtillon, La Rochejaquelein joined the Royal Polish Regiment, of which his father was colonel, in 1787. In February 1789 he became a member of the Flanders regiment of chasseurs. In March 1792 he became a member of the Constitutional Guard, charged with protecting the King of France. He fought for the first time defending the Tuileries Palace on the 10 August 1792 attack, as an officer of the Constitutional Guard of King Louis XVI.\n\nReturning to his home province, he refused to comply with the \"levée en masse\" called by the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars and joined his cousin Louis Marie de Lescure on the latter's estates in Poitou.\n\nResistance to conscription soon escalated into a full rebellion, known as the War in the Vendée. Soon after, De la Rochejaquelein and his compatriots started fighting the troops of the French Republic with Maurice d'Elbée and the Marquis de Bonchamps from April 1793. There, he gave his famous order, \"\"Mes amis, si j'avance, suivez-moi! Si je recule, tuez-moi! Si je meurs, vengez-moi!\"\" (literal translation: \"Friends, if I advance, follow me! If I retreat, kill me! If I die, avenge me!\").\n\nLeading a few thousand Vendéan peasants, De la Rochejaquelein gained his first victory over the French Revolutionary Army on 13 April, took part to the taking of Bressuire on 3 May, in the Battle of Fontenay-le-Comte on 25 May and in the Battle of Saumur on 9 June. At Fontenay he was famous for his contempt for danger, wearing three red handkerchiefs; on his head, around his neck and at his waist to defy the Republican gunners. After Fontenay his companions decided that they would also wear three red handkerchiefs so that De la Rochejacquelin could not be singled out.\n\nIn August, after the Battle of Luçon, he regrouped the Vendéan army, which was on the verge of being disbanded, and won the Battle of Chantonnay on 5 September. On 13 September the thumb of his right hand was shattered by a bullet during an engagement with Republicans at Martigné-Briand but he continued to fire at his opponents. His famous portrait by Pierre-Narcisse Guérin shows him with his right arm in a sling, shooting with his left hand. He had to retreat across the Loire after being beaten in the Battle of Cholet, on 17 October.\n\nOn 20 October, De la Rochejaquelein was unanimously elected as commander-in-chief of the Catholic and Royal Army, replacing D'Elbée who had been severely wounded in Cholet. However, his bravery did not compensate for his lack of experience and strategic skills. He marched onto Granville, took Avranches on 12 November but failed to seize Granville and retreated to Angers in order to cross the Loire.\n\nLarger forces under François Séverin Marceau, Jean Baptiste Kléber, and François Joseph Westermann gave chase, defeating him once in Le Mans on 12 December and again, more severely, on 23 December in Savenay. After this decisive rout, the Catholic and Royal Army was no longer a fighting force; De la Rochejacquelein had to take to the woods disguised as a peasant. He managed to save the remains of his army by crossing the Loire, and left under the criticism of his fellow companions.\n\nWhile trying to pursue a guerrilla war against the Republicans, he was killed by a Republican soldier near Nuaillé on 28 January 1794. On a reconnaissance mission he had spotted two Republican soldiers who pretended to surrender to him, but then shot him in the forehead. His brother Louis became the head of the royalists in Vendée in 1813 and furthered the royalist cause there during the Hundred Days period. He fell in battle at Pont-de-Mathis on 4 June 1815.\n\n"}
{"id": "2148946", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2148946", "title": "Ride height", "text": "Ride height\n\nRide height or ground clearance is the amount of space between the base of an automobile tire and the lowest point (typically the axle); or, more properly, to the shortest distance between a flat, level surface, and the lowest part of a vehicle other than those parts designed to contact the ground (such as tires, tracks, skis, etc.). Ground clearance is measured with standard vehicle equipment, and for cars, is usually given with no cargo or passengers.\n\nGround clearance is a critical factor in several important characteristics of a vehicle. For all vehicles, especially cars, variations in clearance represent a trade-off between handling and practicality. A higher ground clearance means that the center of mass of the car is higher, which makes for less precise and more dangerous handling characteristics (most notably, the chance of rollover is higher). However, it also means that the car is more capable of being driven on roads that are not level, without the road scraping against and likely damaging the chassis and underbody. Higher ride heights will typically adversely affect aerodynamic properties. This is why sports cars typically have very low clearances, while off-road vehicles and SUVs have higher ones. Two well-known extremes of each are the Ferrari F40 and the Hummer.\n\nFor armored fighting vehicles (AFV), ground clearance presents an additional factor in a vehicle's overall performance: a lower ground clearance means that the vehicle minus the chassis is lower to the ground and thus harder to spot and harder to hit. The final design of any AFV reflects a compromise between being a smaller target on one hand, and having greater battlefield mobility on the other. Very few AFVs have top speeds at which car-like handling becomes an issue, though rollovers can and do occur. By contrast, an AFV is far more likely to need high ground clearance than a road vehicle.\nLowering a car's suspension is a common and relatively inexpensive aftermarket modification. Many car enthusiasts prefer the more aggressive look of a lowered body, and there is an easily realized car handling improvement from the lower center of gravity. Most passenger cars are produced such that one or two inches of lowering will not significantly increase the probability of damage. On most automobiles, ride height is modified by changing the length of the suspension springs, and is the essence of many aftermarket suspension kits supplied by manufacturers such as Eibach and H&R .\n\nSome cars have used underslung frames to achieve a lower ride height and the consequent improvement in center of gravity. The brass-era cars of the American Motor Car Company are one example.\n\nSelf-leveling suspension systems are designed to maintain a constant ride height regardless of load. Vehicles not equipped with self-leveling will pitch down at one end when laden; this adversely affects ride, handling, and aerodynamic properties.\n\nSome modern automobiles (such as Audi's Allroad Quattro) have adjustable suspension systems, which can vary the ride height by locating the suspension mounting points, depending on road conditions and/or the settings selected by the driver.\nOther, simpler suspension systems, such as coilover springs, offer a way of manually adjusting ride height (and often, spring stiffness) by compressing the spring in situ, using a threaded shaft and adjustable knob or nut.\n\n18-wheel tractor-trailers also have to take the ground clearance of both their tractor and especially trailer into consideration on certain areas of uneven terrain, such as raised railroad crossings. Their extremely long wheelbase means that such terrain could potentially catch the undercarriage of the trailer in the wide space between the axles, potentially leaving the truck stuck with no means to extricate itself.\n\nIn some areas buses are required to have a ground clearance of at least . Too much ride height can cause the vehicle to have an excessively high center of gravity, which could cause the vehicle to be unstable or even flip.\n"}
{"id": "2148947", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2148947", "title": "Elva (car manufacturer)", "text": "Elva (car manufacturer)\n\nElva was a sports and racing car manufacturing company based in Bexhill, then Hastings and Rye, East Sussex, United Kingdom. The company was founded in 1955 by Frank G. Nichols. The name comes from the French phrase \"elle va\" (\"she goes\").\n\nFrank Nichols's intention was to build a low-cost sports/racing car, and a series of models were produced between 1954 and 1959. The original model, based on the CSM car built nearby in Hastings by Mike Chapman, used Standard Ten front suspension rather than Ford swing axles, and a Ford Anglia rear axle with an overhead-valve-conversion of a Ford 10 engine. About 25 were made. While awaiting delivery of the CSM, Nichols finished second in a handicap race at Goodwood on 27 March 1954, driving a Lotus. \"From racing a Ford-engined CSM sports car in 1954, just for fun but nevertheless with great success, Frank Nichols has become a component manufacturer. The intermediate stage was concerned with the design of a special head, tried in the CSM and the introduction of the Elva car which was raced with success in 1955.\" The cylinder head for the 1,172 cc Ford engine, devised by Malcolm Witts and Harry Weslake, featured overhead inlet valves.\n\nOn 22 May 1955 Robbie Mackenzie-Low climbed Prescott in the sports Elva to set the class record at 51.14 sec. Mackenzie-Low also won the Bodiam Hill Climb outright at the end of the season.\n\nThe 1956 Elva MK II works prototype, registered KDY 68, was fitted with a Falcon all-enveloping fibreglass bodyshell. Nichols developed the Elva Mk II from lessons learnt in racing the prototype: \"That car was driven in 1956 races by Archie Scott Brown, Stuart Lewis-Evans and others.\" The Elva Mk II appeared in 1957: \"Main differences from the Mark I are in the use of a De Dion rear axle as on the prototype, but with new location, inboard rear brakes, lengthened wheelbase, and lighter chassis frame.\" The car was offered as standard with 1,100 cc Coventry-Climax engine. This went through various changes up to the Mark IV of 1958.\nCarl Haas, from Chicago, was Elva agent in the midwest of the United States from the mid-1950s through the 1960s. In 1958 he was invited to England to drive an Elva in the Tourist Trophy at Goodwood, where he finished twelfth overall. With the Mark IV: \"The major change is an all-new independent rear suspension utilizing low-pivot swing axles. The body is entirely new with close attention to aerodynamics and a reduced frontal area.\" At the Sebring 12 Hours sports car race in 1959 the No. 48 Elva Mark IV driven by Frank Baptista, Art Tweedale and Charley Wallace finished first in Class G, and 19th overall.\n\nOn 21 June 1959, Arthur Tweedale and Bob Davis won the Marlboro Six Hour Endurance Race in Maryland driving the No. 37 Elva Mk IV. Arthur Tweedale repeated the win in the Marlboro Six Hours in 1960. Teamed with Ed Costley he covered 337.75 miles in an Elva Mk V sports car. This was the final iteration of the Elva front-engined sports racing car. The last Mk V chassis won a number of important races in the midwest driven by Dick Buedingen, including the 1961 Elkhart Lake 500 teamed with Carl Haas. At this time Elva Cars Limited was operating from premises at Sedlescombe Road North, Hastings, Sussex, England.\n\nElva produced a single-seater car for Formula Junior events, the FJ 100, initially supplied with a front-mounted B.M.C. 'A' series engine in a tubular steel chassis. \"Elva Cars, Ltd., new Formula Junior powered by an untuned BMC 'A' Series 948cc engine. The price of this 970 lb. car is $2,725 in England. Wheelbase: 84\", tread: 48\", brake lining area: 163\" sq. The 15\" wheels are cast magnesium. Independent suspension front and rear with transverse wishbones, coil springs, and telescopic shock absorbers. The car is 12 feet, four inches long.\" Bill de Selincourt won a race at Cadours, France, in an Elva-B.M.C. FJ on September 6, 1959. Nichols switched to a two-stroke DKW engine supplied by Gerhard Mitter. In 1959 Peter Arundell won the John Davy Trophy at the Boxing Day Brands Hatch meeting driving an Elva-D.K.W. \"Orders poured in for the Elva but when the 1960 season commenced Lotus and Cooper had things under control and disillusioned Elva owners watched the rear-engined car disappearing round corners, knowing they had backed the wrong horse.\" Sporadic success continued for Elva in the early part of that year, with Jim Hall winning at Sebring and Loyer at Montlhéry.\n\nElva produced a rear-engined FJ car, with B.M.C. engine, at the end of the 1960 season. Chuck Dietrich finished third at Silverstone in the BRDC British Empire Trophy race on 1 October. In 1961 \"an entirely new and rather experimental Elva-Ford\" FJ-car debuted at Goodwood, making fastest lap, driven by Chris Meek.\n\nAfter financial problems caused by the failure of the US distributor, Frank Nichols started a new company in Rye, Sussex in 1961 to continue building racing cars. The Elva Mk VI rear-engined sports car, with 1,100 cc Coventry Climax power, made its competition debut at Brands Hatch on Boxing Day, 1961, driven by Chris Ashmore, finishing second to the three-litre Ferrari of Graham Hill. The car was designed by Keith Marsden.\n\nOn 8 September 1963, Bill Wuesthoff and Augie Pabst won the Road America 500, round seven of the United States Road Racing Championship, at Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin driving an Elva Mk.7-Porsche. \"The Elva-Porsche is based on the Mark VII Elva, but redesigned aft of the front section to take the 1,700 cc Porsche air-cooled flat-four unit and its horizontal cooling fan.\"\n\nEdgar Barth won the opening round of the European Hill Climb Championship on 7 June 1964, at Rossfeld in southern Germany in an Elva-Porsche flat-eight sports car. The cars were placed throughout the seven-round series with Herbert Muller winning at the final round at Sierre Montana Crans in Switzerland on 30 August 1964.\n\nAround 1964-1966 Elva made a very successful series of Mk8 sports racers mostly with 1.8 litre BMW engines (modified from the 1.6 litre by Nerus) and some with 1.15 litre Holbay-Ford engines. The Mk8 had a longer wheelbase and wider track compared to the Mk7, which was known for difficult handling due to a 70-30 weight bias to the rear. Following the success of the McLaren in sportscar racing, Elva became involved in producing cars for sale to customers: \"Later a tie-up with Elva and the Trojan Group was arranged and they took over the manufacture of the McLaren sports/racer, under the name McLaren-Elva-Oldsmobile.\" At the 1966 Racing Car Show, held in London in January, Elva exhibited two sports racing cars – the McLaren-Elva Mk.II V8 and the Elva-BMW Mk. VIIIS. The McLaren-Elva was offered with the option of Oldsmobile, Chevrolet or Ford V8 engines. The Elva-BMW Mk. VIIIS was fitted with a rear-mounted BMW two-litre four-cylinder OHC engine.\n\nLuki Botha campaigned an Elva-Porsche in southern Africa from 1966.\n\nThe main road car, introduced in 1958, was called the Courier and went through a series of developments throughout the existence of the company. Initially all the cars were exported, home market sales not starting until 1960. Mark Donohue had his first racing successes in an Elva Courier winning the SCCA F Prod Championship in 1960 and the SCCA E Prod Championship in 1961.\n\nThe Mk 1 used a 1500 cc MGA or Riley 1.5 litre engine in a ladder chassis with Elva designed independent front suspension. The engine was set well back in the chassis to help weight distribution, which produced good handling but encroached on the cockpit making the car a little cramped. The chassis carried lightweight 2-seater open glassfibre bodywork. It was produced as a complete car for the US and European market and available in kit form for the UK market. After about 50 cars were made it was upgraded to the Mk II which was the same car but fitted with a proprietary curved glass windscreen, replacing the original flat-glass split type, and the larger 1600 cc MGA engine. Approximately 400 of the Mk I and II were made.\n\nThe rights to the Elva Courier were acquired by Trojan in 1962, and production moved to the main Trojan factory in Purley Way, Croydon, Surrey. \"Competition Press\" announced: \"Elva Courier manufacturing rights have been sold to Lambretta-Trojan in England. F-Jr Elva and Mark IV sports cars will continue to be built by Frank Nichols as in the past.\"\n\nWith the Trojan takeover the Mk III was introduced in 1962 and was sold as a complete car. On the home market a complete car cost £965 or the kit version £716. The chassis was now a box frame moulded into the body. Triumph rack and pinion steering and front suspension was standardised. A closed coupé body was also available with either a reverse slope Ford Anglia-type rear window or a fastback. In autumn 1962: \"Elva Courier Mk IV was shown at London Show. New coupe has all-independent suspension, fiberglass body, MG engine. Mk III Couriers were also shown. Though previously equipped with MG-A engines, new versions will be equipped with 1800cc MG-B engine.\" Later the Ford Cortina GT unit was available. The final version, the fixed head coupé Mk IV T type used Lotus twin-cam engines with the body modified to give more interior room. It could be had with all independent suspension and four wheel disc brakes. 210 were made.\n\nKen Sheppard Customised Sports Cars of Shenley, Hertfordshire acquired the Elva Courier from Trojan in 1965 but production ended in 1968.\n\nThere was also a GT160 which never got beyond production of three prototypes. It used a BMW dry sump engine of 2 litre capacity with bodywork styled by Englishman Trevor Frost (also known as Trevor Fiore, and who also designed the Trident) and made by Carrozzeria Fissore of Turin. It weighed and had so would have had very impressive performance but was deemed too costly to put into series production. The car was shown at the London Motor Show in 1964. One of the cars was purchased by Richard Wrottesley and entered in the 1965 24 Hours of Le Mans. Co-driven by Tony Lanfranchi, the car retired early in the race.\n\nThere was another Elva car company that lasted for one year, 1907, and was based in Paris, France.\n\n\n"}

She was best known for her leading roles in the cult films \"Konga\" and \"Beat Girl\", Gordon became the subject of singer Scott Walker's song \"Archangel\".\n\nGordon was born in Cambridge, in England. Her father was a doctor and her mother a make-up artist who worked for Max Factor. After being photographed by chance at the Queens Ice Rink, Bayswater, for the cover of the magazine \"Lilliput\", she was signed to a five-year contract with film agent Bill Watts and played a harem girl in the Bernard Bresslaw film \"I Only Arsked!\" (1958), before making her first stage appearance, still aged only seventeen, in \"Meet the Cousin\", which starred Cicely Courtneidge and Jack Hulbert. The show opened at the Lyceum Theatre, Edinburgh, and it was there that she met her husband-to-be William Donaldson, later better known as Henry Root, who was just starting out as a theatrical producer.\n\nFollowing a spell in repertory at the New Theatre Royal, Portsmouth, playing a Russian spy in Agatha Christie's \"Verdict\" and a gum-chewing blonde in \"Brighton Rock\" and some pre-London tours, she made her West End theatre debut on a motorbike in \"The Darling Buds of May\" at the Saville Theatre; and then played the role of Peggy, a dumb blonde film starlet, in a show-stopping scene with Michael Crawford in Neil Simon's first hit \"Come Blow Your Horn\" at London's Prince of Wales Theatre, \nLater, at Donaldson's request, she appeared as an entirely French-speaking Lady Fifi de Winter in an improvised production of \"The Three Musketeers\" with Bruce Lacey and The Alberts, at the Arts Theatre. Donaldson's talent for presenting controversial and often money-losing shows didn't desert him; the show ran for two weeks; and Gordon made theatrical history as the first actress to appear naked on stage. (\"Watch out for the bath scene; it's a breakthrough\", wrote the \"New Statesman\".) Most recently, she played the Fairy Godmother in \"Cinderella\" at the Princess Theatre, Hunstanton, and worked with Sarah Louise Young in Clive Evans's two woman show \"The Nunnery\".\n\nGordon married Donaldson on 1 September 1967. A year later he inherited a fortune on the death of his grandmother. Donaldson's biographer later noted that the marriage was \"not an easy one\".\n\nAfter it broke down, Gordon joined the Open University and went on to graduate from Middlesex University with a BA degree in English and American History and Literature.\nGordon was with Dr Stephen Ward the night that he met Christine Keeler, and with William Donaldson when the police raided and planted hash in their Chelsea flat; for which the policemen were later jailed. By the end of her life, she had been working on her memoirs and a documentary about her experiences while living in Egypt before and after the 2011 revolution.\n\nClaire Gordon died of a brain tumour on 13 April 2015 in a nursing home in west London. After her death, two former \"property consultants\" were sent for trial on charges of fraud and conspiracy to defraud by altering her will.\n\n\n"}

Using the former derivation, Balloch means \"village on the loch\", i.e. the nearby Loch Lomond, but this would be Baile Loch.\n\nBalloch is at the north end of the Vale of Leven, straddling the River Leven itself. It connects to the larger town of Alexandria and to the smaller village of Jamestown, both of which are located to its south. It also borders the Kilpatrick Hills. To the east of the town lies the major local authority housing scheme in the area known as 'The Haldane' or 'The Mill of Haldane'. Glasgow is located around to the southeast. Balloch lies on the 56th parallel, at about the same latitude as Moscow.\n\nWith its accessible location at the southern end of Loch Lomond and just off the main road from Glasgow to the West Highlands (A82), it is an important centre of tourism, especially from Glasgow and Dumbarton. The village has a number of hotels, inns and pubs, and there are cruises from Balloch up Loch Lomond, and other services, including to nearby locations like Luss, and the Renfrew Ferry service. The largest number of boats cruising on Loch Lomond leave from Balloch. The village is also the home of Dunkirk vessel Skylark XI which helped rescue 600 troops during WWII. It contains Balloch Country Park and Balloch Castle, and is at the southern end of the first Scottish national park, Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park. There is a Sea Life Centre in the village . The Loch Lomond Youth Soccer Festival used to take place in the village . \"Lochfoot\" in the Jean Robertson novels of Jane Duncan is partly based on the village. The PS \"Maid of the Loch\" is currently being restored at Balloch pier and the Balloch Steam Slipway is located nearby.\n\nThe A811 road (based on an 18th-century military road) goes from Balloch to Stirling, and the A813 goes from Dumbarton to Balloch. The Glasgow to Loch Lomond cycle path (part of National Cycle Route 7) ends at Balloch. The West Loch Lomond Cycle Path also runs from Balloch. The village was formerly served by two railway stations on the Caledonian and Dunbartonshire Junction Railway: Balloch Central, and Balloch Pier, which closed in 1988 and 1986, respectively. The village now has one railway station opened by British Rail, which is a terminus of the North Clyde electric train service from Glasgow.\n\nBalloch is served by Balloch Primary School and St Kessog’s Primary school, both located at the newly built Balloch Campus.

In 1836 the trade was described by Isaac Taylor: \nThe principal manual skills of the whitesmith were in filing and turning (the use of lathes). Using cross-cut files the whitesmith could achieve a flat, smooth finish on iron or steel products where the less skilled might only achieve a convex effect. For very large items, the whitesmith might even file when red hot using a two-person operated float file.\n\nThis profession is also related to a bell hanger and locksmith as they perform much file work. In Great Britain this type of worker was affiliated with a union. The Amalgamated Society of Whitesmiths was founded in 1889. It was renamed the Amalgamated Society of Whitesmiths, Locksmiths, Bell-hangers, Domestic Engineers, Art Metal Workers and General Iron Fitters in 1891, the Amalgamated Society of Whitesmiths, Locksmiths, Bell-hangers, Domestic Engineers, Art Metal Workers and General Iron and Pipe Fitters in 1894, and the Amalgamated Society of Whitesmiths, Domestic Engineers and General Pipe Fitters in 1904. In 1908 it merged with the Amalgamated Society of Kitchen Range, Stove Grate, Gas Stove, Hot Water, Art Metal and other Smiths and Fitters connected with the above Trades, the Amalgamated Society of Kitchen Range, Hot Water and General Fitters and the Birmingham Society of Hot Water and Steam Engineers to form the National Union of Operative Heating and Domestic Engineers, Whitesmiths and General Iron Workers\n\nJames Watt employed a whitesmith in the 1760s when working on his experimental steam engine. The first cylinder was made by this whitesmith using hammered iron and solder. Although this technique proved insufficient, when this whitesmith died soon after Watt wrote to John Roebuck greatly lamenting the loss of his \"white iron man\".\n\nWith the industrial revolution, in the same way that many blacksmiths became specialised as farriers making horse shoes, so many whitesmiths became lorimers making spurs, stirrups, bridle bits and buckles.\n\nTypically whitesmiths made products that either required a decorative finish such as fire grates, or that needed cold-working such as screws and lathed machine parts.\n"}

{"id": "2148975", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2148975", "title": "Lugal", "text": "Lugal\n\nLugal (Sumerian: ) is the Sumerian term for \"king, ruler\". Literally, the term means \"big man.\" In Sumerian, \"lu\" \"𒇽\" is \"man\" and \"gal\" \"𒃲\" is \"great,\" or \"big.\"\n\nIt was one of several Sumerian titles that a ruler of a city-state could bear (alongside \"en\" and \"ensi\", the exact difference being a subject of debate). The sign eventually became the predominant logograph for \"King\" in general. In the Sumerian language, \"lugal\" is used to mean an owner (e.g. of a boat or a field) or a head (of a unit such as a family).\n\nAs a cuneiform logograph (Sumerogram) LUGAL (Unicode: , rendered in Neo Assyrian).\n\nThe cuneiform sign LUGAL 𒈗 (Borger nr. 151, Unicode U+12217) serves as a determinative in cuneiform texts (Sumerian, Akkadian and Hittite), indicating that the following word is the name of a king. In Akkadian orthography, it may also be a syllabogram \"šàr\", acrophonically based on the Akkadian for \"king\", \"šarrum\".\n\nThere are different theories regarding the meaning of the title \"lugal\" in 3rd-millennium Sumer. Some scholars believe that a ruler of an individual city-state was usually called \"ensi\", and a ruler who headed a confederacy or larger dominion composed of several cities, perhaps even the whole of Sumer, was a \"lugal\". The functions of such a \"lugal\" would include certain ceremonial and cultic activities, arbitration in border disputes, military defence against external enemies, and once the lugal has died, the eldest son must take over. The \"ensis\" of Lagash would sometimes refer to the city's patron deity, Ningirsu, as their \"lugal\" (\"master\"). All of the above is connected to the possibly priestly or sacral character of the titles \"ensi\" and especially \"en\" (the latter term continuing to designate priests in subsequent times). \n\nOther scholars consider \"ensi\", \"en\" and \"lugal\" to have been merely three local designations for the sovereign, accepted respectively in the city-states of Lagash, Uruk and Ur (as well as most of the rest of Sumer), although the various terms may have expressed different aspects of the Mesopotamian concept of kingship. A \"lugal\" at that time is assumed to have been \"normally a young man of outstanding qualities from a rich landowning family.\" Thorkild Jacobsen theorized that he was originally an (elected) war leader, as opposed to the (likewise elected) \"en\", who dealt with internal issues. \n\nAmong the earliest rulers whose inscriptions describe them as \"lugals\" are Enmebaragesi and Mesilim at Kish, and Meskalamdug, Mesannepada and several of their successors at Ur. At least from the Third Dynasty of Ur onwards, only \"lugal\" was used to designate a contemporary sovereign in Sumerian.\n\nThe term \"Lugal\" is used extensively in the Amarna letters, for addressing kings or pharaohs, and elsewhere in speaking about various kings. One common address, in the introduction of many letters, from the vassals writing to the pharaoh was to use: \"Šàr-ri\", (for \"šarrum\"); they used Lugal + ri = Šàr-ri, (i.e. Pharaoh, or King of, Ancient Egypt). (Ri is one of the more commonly used hieroglyphs, in many cases for the use of the \"r\").\n"}

His first job after school was at IBM, but he left after a year. His next job was at Witton Cemetery.\n\nAt the age of 17, Ross won a DJ competition run by the Birmingham Evening Mail, beating Johnnie Walker, who came second. Part of his prize was to appear at Radio Luxembourg for an audition, but this never happened. He was offered his first gig at the Mecca Ballroom in Birmingham before moving on to the Birmingham Rollerskating Rink.\n\nThe break he was waiting for came in 1970 when he joined BBC Radio Birmingham (now BBC WM), presenting a Saturday morning show with John Henry. It was one of the first \"zoo-radio\" formats – involving a studio audience and interactive elements and phone-in requests presented by Fiona MacDonald.\n\nThe breakfast show, entitled \"On The Move\", was unusual because it started at 5am. The BBC national networks did not start programming until 6am making Ross the only presenter on the air in the UK during that hour. The Radio Birmingham transmitter at 5.5 kW was one of the more powerful local radio ones in the country at the time and so Ross enjoyed an audience of shift workers over a wide area.\n\nIn 1974, Ross was applied to work at BRMB; but they rejected him. In the summer of 1975, Ross joined Radio Tees in the North East of England, presenting their breakfast show. He also presented a successful Saturday morning music show which used the talents of the station's record librarian Wincey Willis as co-presenter. In March 1976, Ross returned to Birmingham and joined BRMB, taking over the breakfast show from Adrian Juste, who had left to join BBC Radio 1.\n\nRoss also co-hosted Revolver, a British music series that ran for eight episodes on ITV in 1978, alongside Peter Cook. The late-night show, filmed with a live audience, was set in a seedy ballroom-turned-rock venue. In his role of assistant manager, Les Ross ran a hamburger stand while offering rock trivia gems and introducing the \"Revolver Reviver\" nostalgia spot.\n\nRoss won many awards, including 'Independent Radio Personality of the Year Award' in 1986, and in 1997 he received a Sony Award and an MBE from the Queen for his services to broadcasting.\n\nWith the launch of sister station Xtra AM in 1989, Ross moved on to present there for four years. In August 1993, Ross returned to BRMB Breakfast show, where he had female co-presenters by his side during this period, including Suzi Becker and Tammy Gooding. After 26 years of broadcasting, on Friday 27 September 2002, Ross presented his final BRMB Breakfast show, live from Birmingham International station. As 9 o'clock approached, he boarded a Virgin Trains West Coast train hauled by electric locomotive no. 86259 especially named 'Les Ross' to mark the end of his BRMB radio career.\nHe later purchased and preserved this locomotive in operational condition following its retirement from regular passenger service. Locomotive 86259 has been returned to mainline use and sees use on various rail tours, painted in it original 1960s British Rail electric blue livery.\n\nOn Monday 6 January 2003, Ross took over from David Hamilton, on Birmingham's Saga 105.7 FM breakfast show. However, in December 2004, he quit the station as he claimed the station management was guilty of sending \"nannying\" e-mails which were turning him into a \"robo-jock\" and was apparently barred from drinking coffee during his early show.\n\nHe announced his departure, planned for Christmas Eve 2004, after he was only offered a one-year contract, below half-pay, despite doubling the show's ratings in recent audience research figures. Ross stated \"How much would I have had to put the ratings up by just to get the same deal as I was on before? If I had been happy and felt that I had support, I might have stayed for half the money. But I wasn't happy and I feel that if you pay peanuts, you get monkeys\". His departure came before Christmas Eve, as station bosses decided to take action when Ross spoke to the local press about what had happened.\n\nRumour mills went quickly into action about where Ross would turn up next. BBC Radio WM hired him to present a weekly show on Sunday mornings from 9am to midday. On Sunday 6 February 2005, Ross presented his first weekly show on BBC WM. He would also cover for various holidaying presenters on the station including Adrian Goldberg, Ed Doolan and Danny Kelly, which Ross would later take over the afternoon show permanently.\n\nIn addition to his Sunday morning show, on Saturday 23 July 2005, Ross also took over the Saturday Breakfast show from 6 to 9am.\n\nRoss took over the Monday to Friday 1 to 4pm slot from Danny Kelly on WM on Tuesday 10 April 2007.\n\nBBC WM's managing editor, Keith Beech, said: \"Les Ross is one of the best-loved and most popular presenters there is. I'm excited about the prospect of hearing him every day here on BBC WM.\"\n\nIn early 2009, the show went out from 2 to 4pm on weekdays and has since left the station just after his 60th Birthday.\n\nOn 7 December 2009, Les Ross returned to the airwaves when he became the presenter of the Big City Breakfast Show on Birmingham's Big City Radio 89.1. He hosted his final show for the station on Friday 26 March 2010. He returned to the station on 10 February 2013 to front a Sunday afternoon show.<br>\n\nIn April 2015, Les Ross started broadcasting on Wolverhampton's 101.8 WCRFM: www.wcrfm.com.

{"id": "2148988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2148988", "title": "Joyce Wieland", "text": "Joyce Wieland\n\nJoyce Wieland (June 30, 1930 – June 27, 1998) was a Canadian experimental filmmaker and mixed media artist. Wieland found success as a painter when she began her career in Toronto in the 1950s. In 1962, Wieland moved to New York City and expanded her career as an artist by including new materials and mixed media work. During that time, she also rose to prominence as an experimental filmmaker and soon, renowned institutions such as the Museum of Modern Art in New York were showing her films. In 1971, Wieland's \"True Patriot Love\" exhibition was the first solo exhibition by a living Canadian female artist at the National Gallery of Canada. In 1982, Wieland received the honour of the Order of Canada and in 1987, she was awarded the Toronto Arts Foundation's Visual Arts Award. She was also a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts.\n\nWieland was born on June 30, 1930 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Her parents were immigrants from Britain. She was the daughter of Sydney Arthur Wieland and Rosetta Amelia Watson. They fell in love when Watson was still engaged to another man. Wieland's father died from heart disease in 1937, and her mother followed soon after him, leaving her and her two siblings to fend for themselves in financially difficult circumstances.\n\nWieland's aptitude for art was first expressed during her childhood, when she made many drawings and comic books to help her cope with the death of her parents. However, she decided to pursue fashion instead of art.\n\nAs a teenager, she attended Central Technical School, where she studied commercial art and graphic design. Wieland first enrolled in dress design and hoped it would help her land a job since she thought art would not be financially rewarding. However, at Central Tech, she met Doris McCarthy who taught at the school. McCarthy's unique artistic identity inspired Wieland to pursue her own. She saw potential in Wieland and convinced her to transfer into the art department.\n\nAfter graduating in 1948, Wieland held various jobs as a graphic designer. Wieland's first job was with E.S. & A. Robinson in design packaging, followed by work as a designer at Planned Sales. While working for these agencies, Wieland interacted with many artists and fellow alumni from Central Tech and the Ontario College of Art. During this time, she also kept focusing on her art but wasn't confident in showing off her work yet.\n\nIn the early 1950s, Wieland's interest in art films grew and she started attending the Toronto Film Society screenings where she was introduced to the works of filmmakers such as Maya Deren, who later influenced her own films. In 1953, Wieland joined Graphic Associates, an animation studio where she learned techniques she would later apply in her own films.\n\nShe had her first solo exhibition in 1960 at the Isaacs gallery in Toronto, making her the only woman that the prestigious gallery represented and instantly earning her greater recognition for her work.\n\nShe moved to New York in 1962 and throughout the decade produced most of her experimental films. One of these films is \"Rat Life and Diet in North America\" (1968), which presents animals as its main characters. The film is a metaphor for revolution and escape, where cats are the oppressors and the gerbils are the oppressed. The gerbils represent political prisoners in the United States who make their way to freedom in Canada. \"Rat Life and Diet in North America\" is an example of how Wieland's concern with political issues, nationalism, symbols, and myths was represented aesthetically through her works. Wieland's self-identification as a feminist in an era of second wave of feminism also manifested itself through aesthetic means and played an important part in her career as an artist. However, her visual-art practice's popularity remained confined within Canada.\n\nDue to the political climate in the United States, Wieland returned to Toronto in 1971. She believed that she couldn't make art anymore in America due to its ideological orientation. Her 1976 film \"The Far Shore\" had \"devastating appraisals and dismal box office receipts.\" Following this, her next project—a dramatization of Margaret Laurence's iconic 1974 novel \"The Diviners\"—did not get off the ground. In 1987 a retrospective of her work at the Art Gallery of Ontario presented a critical overview of both her visual art practice and her experimental films.\n\nJoyce Wieland was a central figure in Canadian art during the 1960s and 1970s. Though, she began her career as a painter, her work came to explore a wide range of materials and media, including film. The 1960s were an incredibly productive time for Wieland, as she responded to the contemporary artistic trends of Pop art and Conceptual art. Joanne Sloane maintains in \"Joyce Wieland: Life & Work\" that her encounters with these influences \"were always original and idiosyncratic.\" Sloane identifies the several consistent bodies of Wieland's work that emerged throughout the 1960s as: \"quasi-abstract paintings that reveal messages, signs, or erotic drawings; collages and sculptural assemblages; filmic paintings; disaster paintings; plastic film-assemblages; quilts and other fabric-based objects; and language-based works.\" Her art was often infused with humour, even as it engaged with issues of war, gender, ecology, and nationalism.\n\nInternationally, Wieland is best known as an experimental filmmaker whose work challenged and bridged boundaries among avant-garde film factions of her time. Her works introduced physical manipulation of the filmstrip that inscribed an explicitly female craft tradition into her films while also playing with the facticity of photographed images. Wieland's output was small but received considerable attention in comparison to other female avant-garde filmmakers of her time. As both a gallery artist and a filmmaker, Wieland was able to cross over between those realms and to garner attention and support in both worlds.\n\nIn the 1980s, Joyce Wieland focused again on painting, though her representations of natural environments became less identifiably Canadian. With their intense colours and near psychedelic effects, Wieland’s later landscapes seem almost outside of time and place.\n\nIn 1956, Wieland married filmmaker Michael Snow, whom she had met through her job at the animation studio. They remained married for over twenty years until their divorce in 1976. In 1962, Wieland and Snow moved to New York where they lived until 1971.\n\nAfter she moved back to Toronto in 1971, Wieland maintained a studio practice there until her death on June 27, 1998 from Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\n\nIn 2014, the focus of artist Mark Clintberg's Fogo Island residency was a quilted response to Wieland's work \"Reason Over Passion.\" The original work, made in both English and French, was inspired by the motto of the then-Prime Minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau. The quilt was infamously torn apart by his wife, Margaret Trudeau, in a fit of rage at his cold logic during an argument. In her autobiography \"Beyond Reason\" (1979), Trudeau narrates that encounter:\n\nClintberg's response, sewn in collaboration with the Wind and Waves Artisans' Guild, turns Wieland's work on its head, formally and literally as each piece of the quilt is stitched \"wrong\"-side up exposing its soft-coloured underbelly. Moreover in the figurative sense, his re-imagining renewed the need for passion instead of reason that Margaret pleaded in her rage. Unlike Wieland's quilts, which hung on the wall, Clintberg's quilts are placed on a random bed each night at the Fogo Island Inn.\n\n\n"}

He did his national service in submarines 1953-55 as a Sub Lt RNVR. He then went to Wadham College, Oxford and received a BA with first class honours in 1958. This was followed by a period as a Harkness Fellow in the USA (1959–61). He earned an M.A. in 1962 at St. Antony's College, Oxford. Since 1962 he has been a freelance writer.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Mitchell co-wrote the teleplay \"Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)\" with Ray Davies of The Kinks. It was never produced, though it gave rise to the band's concept album. He recently recalled the aborted project: \"\"Arthur\" had a most unhappy history. It was originally meant to be a ... sort of rock opera, and we got as far as casting (excellent director and actors) and finding locations and were about to go when the producer went to a production meeting without a proper budget, tried to flannel his way through it, was immediately sussed and the production pulled.

The earliest was \"Arabesque\" (1966), which was directed by Stanley Donen. \"Another Country\" (1984) is based on Mitchell's own play, and directed by Marek Kanievska. \"Vincent & Theo\" (1990) is a biographical film about the famed painted Vincent van Gogh and his brother Theo, and was directed by Robert Altman. \"August\" (1996) was directed and starred Anthony Hopkins, and was adapted from Anton Chekhov's classic play \"Uncle Vanya\". \"Wilde\" (1997) is based on the life of Oscar Wilde, and was directed by Brian Gilbert.\n\nIn 2007 he wrote the BBC4 drama \"Consenting Adults\" about Sir John Wolfenden and his celebrated 1957 report.\n\n\n"}

Construction commenced in 2010 and was completed in 2014.\n\nHKU station opened on 28 December 2014.\nThere were disputes among locals and district councillors over the station's name. Some suggested to restore the previous official name \"Belcher\" (, , bou2 ceoi3) after The Belcher's, a housing development in the area, as well as Belcher Street and Belcher Bay. Some believed that the MTR Corporation's decision to change the name to \"University\" was not well consulted within the community, while others worried that it might cause confusion with another existing University Station on the East Rail Line. Some also suggested \"Shek Tong Tsui\", after the area the station would serve.\n\nIn August 2009, MTR named the station \"Hong Kong University\". The latest revision changed the English name to \"HKU\", the abbreviation of The University of Hong Kong nearby.\n\nThe station is located under Pok Fu Lam Road.

This makes HKU Station the first to feature lift-only exits.\n\nExits A1 and A2 are served by a total of eight lifts with a maximum load of 1,800 kg per lift. Exit C1 is served by four lifts with a capacity of 2,100 kg each.\n\nHKU Station is proposed to be an interchange station for the Island Line and the South Island line (West). The platforms of the South Island Line (West) will be built under those of the Island Line.\n"}
{"id": "2148997", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2148997", "title": "Aurelian Walls", "text": "Aurelian Walls\n\nThe Aurelian Walls () are a line of city walls built between 271 AD and 275 AD in Rome, Italy, during the reign of the Roman Emperors Aurelian and Probus. They superseded the earlier Servian Wall built during the 4th century BC.\n\nThe walls enclosed all the seven hills of Rome plus the Campus Martius and, on the right bank of the Tiber, the Trastevere district. The river banks within the city limits appear to have been left unfortified, although they were fortified along the Campus Martius. The size of the entire enclosed area is . The wall cut through populated areas: in reality the city at the time embraced 2,400 hectares or 6,000 acres. Pliny the Elder in the first century A.D. suggested that the densely populated areas, 'extrema tectorum' (the limits of the roofed areas) extended from the Golden Milestone in the Forum (Natural History 3.67).\n\nThe full circuit ran for surrounding an area of . The walls were constructed in brick-faced concrete, thick and high, with a square tower every 100 Roman feet ().\n\nIn the 4th century, remodelling doubled the height of the walls to . By 500 AD, the circuit possessed 383 towers, 7,020 crenellations, 18 main gates, 5 postern gates, 116 latrines, and 2,066 large external windows.\n\nBy the third century AD, the boundaries of Rome had grown far beyond the area enclosed by the old Servian Wall, built during the Republican period in the late 4th century BC. Rome had remained unfortified during the subsequent centuries of expansion and consolidation due to lack of hostile threats against the city. The citizens of Rome took great pride in knowing that Rome required no fortifications because of the stability brought by the Pax Romana and the protection of the Roman Army. However, the need for updated defences became acute during the crisis of the Third Century, when barbarian tribes flooded through the Germanic frontier and the Roman Army struggled to stop them. In 270, the barbarian Juthungi and Vandals invaded northern Italy, inflicting a severe defeat on the Romans at Placentia (modern Piacenza) before eventually being driven back. Further trouble broke out in Rome itself in the summer of 271, when the mint workers rose in rebellion. Several thousand people died in the fierce fighting that resulted.\n\nAurelian's construction of the walls as an emergency measure was a reaction to the barbarian invasion of 270; the historian Aurelius Victor states explicitly that the project aimed to alleviate the city's vulnerability. It may also have been intended to send a political signal as a statement that Aurelian trusted that the people of Rome would remain loyal, as well as serving as a public declaration of the emperor's firm hold on power. The construction of the walls was by far the largest building project that had taken place in Rome for many decades, and their construction was a concrete statement of the continued strength of Rome. The construction project was unusually left to the citizens themselves to complete as Aurelian could not afford to spare a single legionary for the project. The root of this unorthodox practice was due to the imminent barbarian threat coupled with the wavering strength of the military as a whole due to being subject to years of bloody civil war, famine and the Plague of Cyprian.\n\nThe walls were built in the short time of only five years, though Aurelian himself died before the completion of the project. Progress was accelerated, and money saved, by incorporating existing buildings into the structure. These included the Amphitheatrum Castrense, the Castra Praetoria, the Pyramid of Cestius, and even a section of the Aqua Claudia aqueduct near the Porta Maggiore. As much as a sixth of the walls is estimated to have been composed of pre-existing structures. An area behind the walls was cleared and sentry passages were built to enable it to be reinforced quickly in an emergency.\n\nThe actual effectiveness of the wall is disputable, given the relatively small size of the city's garrison. The entire combined strength of the Praetorian Guard, \"cohortes urbanae\", and \"vigiles\" of Rome was only about 25,000 men – far too few to defend the circuit adequately. However, the military intention of the wall was not to withstand prolonged siege warfare; it was not common for the barbarian armies to besiege cities, as they were insufficiently equipped and provisioned for such a task. Instead, they carried out hit-and-run raids against ill-defended targets. The wall was a deterrent against such tactics.\n\nParts of the wall were doubled in height by Maxentius, who also improved the watch-towers. In 401, under Honorius, the walls and the gates were improved. At this time, the Tomb of Hadrian across the Tiber was incorporated as a fortress in the city defenses.\n\nThe Aurelian Walls continued as a significant military defense for the city of Rome until September 20, 1870, when the Bersaglieri of the Kingdom of Italy breached the wall near the Porta Pia and captured Rome. The walls also defined the boundary of the city of Rome up until the 19th century, with the built-up area being confined within the walled area.\n\nThe Aurelian Walls remain remarkably well-preserved today, largely the result of their constant use as Rome's primary fortification until the 19th century. The Museo delle Mura near the Porta San Sebastiano offers information on the walls' construction and how the defenses operated. The best-preserved sections of the walls are found from the Muro Torto (Villa Borghese) to Corso d'Italia to Castro Pretorio; from Porta San Giovanni to Porta Ardeatina; from Porta Ostiense to the Tiber; and around Porta San Pancrazio.\n\nList of gates (\"porte\"), from the northernmost and clockwise:\n\n\nGates in Trastevere (from the southernmost and clockwise):\n\n\nNotes\nSources\n\n"}

{"id": "2149006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2149006", "title": "Giant house spider", "text": "Giant house spider\n\nThe giant house spider has been treated as either one species, under the name Eratigena atrica, or as three species, \"E. atrica\", E. duellica and E. saeva. , the three species view was accepted by the World Spider Catalog. They are among the largest spiders of Central and Northern Europe. They were previously placed in the genus \"Tegenaria\". In 2013, they were moved to the new genus \"Eratigena\" as the single species \"Eratigena atrica\". In 2018, the three separate species were restored. The bite of these species does not pose a threat to humans or pets, and they are generally reluctant to bite, preferring instead to hide or escape.\n\nThe two sexes do not differ in coloration or markings. Its coloration is mainly dark brown. On its sternum is a lighter marking, with three light spots on each side. The opisthosoma features a lighter middle line with six \"spots\" on each side. The giant house spider has the same coloration as the domestic house spider, \"Tegenaria domestica\"; it has earthy tones of brown and muddy red or yellow. They also have conspicuously hairy legs, palps and abdomen. Despite its English name, this species is not the largest species in the genus (that being \"Tegenaria parietina\"). The female body size can reach in length, with males having a slightly smaller body at around in length. The female leg span is typically around . The leg span of the male is highly variable, with spans between being common.\n\nIts eight eyes are of equal size and are arranged in two rows. As the eyes contain fewer than 400 visual cells, \"E. atrica\" can probably only distinguish light and dark.\n\nThe first description of a spider now assigned to this species was by Carl Ludwig Koch in 1843, under the name \"Tegenaria atrica\". Other supposedly different species were described later, including \"Tegenaria saeva\" by John Blackwall in 1844, \"Tegenaria duellica\" by Eugène Simon in 1875 and \"Tegenaria gigantea\" by Ralph Vary Chamberlin and Wilton Ivie in 1935. \"T. gigantea\" was synonymized with \"T. duellica\" in 1978. The three remaining taxa have been regarded as distinct species, particularly in Britain. Thus Roberts (1995) provides distinguishing characters for \"T. atrica\", \"T. duellica\" and \"T. saeva\", as does Oxford (2008) for \"T. duellica\" (as \"T. gigantea\") and \"T. saeva\". Others consider these three as part of a single morphologically variable species, for which the oldest name, and hence the senior synonym, is \"T. atrica\".\n\nA phylogenetic study in 2013 concluded that \"Tegenaria\", as then defined, was not monophyletic, and split off some species, including \"T. atrica\", into the newly created segregate genus \"Eratigena\". The study also consolidated the various giant house spider species into one species, \"E. atrica\". A subsequent genetic study of \"E. atrica\" specimens determined that there were three distinct morphological groups, leading to the restoration of three separate species: \"E. atrica\", \"E. duellica\", and \"E. saeva\".\n\n\"E. atrica\" is found in Europe, Central Asia and Northern Africa. It was unwittingly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of North America circa 1900 due to human activity and has strongly increased in numbers for the last century.\n\nIn the last few years the spider has been found in several European countries in which it was previously not recorded, like Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. It is recorded in the checklist of Danish spider species, and is also found in Iceland.\n\nThe giant house spider's original habitat consists mostly of caves, or dry forests where it is found under rocks, but it is a common spider in people's homes.\n\nThe webs built by the giant house spider are flat and messy with a funnel at one end. They do not contain sticky threads. The spider lurks in the funnel until a small invertebrate happens to get trapped in the web, at which point the spider runs out and attacks it. They usually build their webs in corners (on both the floor and ceiling), between boxes in basements, behind cupboards, in attics, or any other area that is rarely disturbed by large animals or humans. Often found near window openings.\n\n\"E. atrica\" normally lives for two or three years, but lifetimes of up to six years have been observed. While the female only leaves its nest to feed, males can often be seen wandering around houses during the late summer and early autumn looking for a mate. Males can be found from July to October, adult females occur all year.\n\nAt least 60 spiderlings emerge from an egg sac. Unusual for spiders, they are subsocial at this stage: they remain together for about a month, but do not cooperate in prey capture. The amount of cannibalism correlates with the amount of available food. \"E. atrica\" molts seven or eight times before reaching the immature adult state, and after a final molt reaches maturity.\n\nLike most spiders, the spider possesses venom to subdue its prey. Since \"E. atrica\" bites can penetrate human skin on occasion, the effects of agatoxin might be felt by bite victims, though these spiders will not bite unless provoked.\n\nWith speeds clocked at , the giant house spider held the Guinness Book of World Records for top spider speed until 1987 when it was displaced by solifugids, although the latter are not true spiders.\n\nA population of giant house spiders is popularly thought to be a deterrent to the establishment of \"Eratigena agrestis\", known in North America as the \"hobo spider\", and considered by some to be more likely to bite humans. Giant house spiders may compete with hobo spiders for the same resources.\nHobo spiders grow no more than a body size of long whereas the larger female giant house spider can have a body size of , but has proportionately much longer legs.\n\nHumorist David Sedaris has written about his relationship with \"E. atrica\". His essay \"April In Paris\" documents his growing affection towards and domestic association with giant house spiders, particularly one named April. The essay can be found in the collection \"When You Are Engulfed in Flames\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2149022", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2149022", "title": "Kudremukh", "text": "Kudremukh\n\nKudremukh(ಕುದುರೆ ಮುಖ) is a mountain range and name of a peak located in Chikkamagaluru district, in Karnataka, India. It is also the name of a small hill station cum mining town situated near the mountain, about 20 kilometres from Kalasa. The name \"Kuduremukha\" literally means 'horse-face' (Kannada) and refers to a particular picturesque view of a side of the mountain that resembles a horse's face. It was also referred to as 'Samseparvata', historically since it was approached from Samse village. Kuduremukha is Karnataka's 2nd highest peak after Mullayangiri. The nearest International Airport is at Mangalore which is at distance of 99 kilometres.\n\nThe Kudremukh National Park (latitude 13°01'00\" to 13°29'17\" N, longitude 75°00'55' to 75°25'00\" E) is the second largest Wildlife Protected Area (600.32 km) belonging to a tropical wet evergreen type of forest in the Western Ghats. Kudremukh National Park is located in Chikkamagaluru district of the State of Karnataka. The Western Ghats is one of the thirty-four hotspots identified for bio-diversity conservation in the world. Kudremukh National Park comes under the Global Tiger Conservation Priority-I, under the format developed jointly by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and World Wide Fund-USA.\n\nThe southern and western sides of the park form the steep slope of the Western Ghats ridgeline, with the altitude varying from 100 m - 1892 m (peak). The northern, central and the eastern portions of the park constitute a chain of rolling hills with a mosaic of natural grassland and shola forests. Kudremukh receives an average annual rainfall of 7000 mm, largely due to the forest types of mainly evergreen vegetation that can be found here.\n\nWell known environmentalist and tiger expert undertook a detailed and systematic survey of the distribution of the endangered lion-tailed macaque in Karnataka during 1983-84 with support from the Government of Karnataka. He observed that suitable and extensive rainforest habitat for the lion-tailed macaque existed in Kudremukh and that the tract probably harbored the largest contiguous population of lion-tailed macaques in the Western Ghats, outside the Malabar region. He further suggested that lion-tailed macaques could be effectively used as a 'flagship' species to conserve the entire biotic community in the region and prepared a conservation plan for the survival of wild populations of lion-tailed macaques in the region delineating the present national park area as a proposed nature reserve. Based on his report, the Karnataka State Wildlife Advisory Board suggested to the government that Kudremukh National Park be created. \n\nKudremukh National Park is spread partly over the thick hilly forests near the coastal plains on the western portion and the shola vegetation on the Western Ghats uplands, covering parts of three districts, viz., Chickmagalur, Udupi and Dakshina Kannada. The Kudremukh peak, by which the national park derives its name, is the highest spot at 1892 meters. The hills, which bear the brunt of the severe monsoon winds, preclude any tree growth added to that the region is known for its rich low-grade magnetite soil which primarily inhibits plant growth. As a result, the landscape is covered with grass. The valleys which are tucked in, have reasonable protection from wind and a deep soil profile, as a result of which stunted evergreen forests exist creating a unique microclimate, rich with mosses, orchids, etc. The whole scenery of grassland interspersed with narrow strips of forests provides a fantastic vista.\n\nThree important rivers, the Tunga, the Bhadra, and the Nethravathi are said to have their origin here. A shrine of goddess \"Bhagavathi\" and a \"Varaha\" image, 1.8 m within a cave are the main attractions. The Tunga River and Bhadra River flow freely through the parklands. The area of the Kadambi waterfalls is a definite point of interest for anyone who travels to the spot. The animals found there include malabar civets, wild dogs, sloth bears and spotted deer.\n\nPeople residing inside the national park did not welcome the idea of such a concept, as it involves eviction and Kudremukh Rashtriya Udyana Virodhi Okoota, an NGO, fights on behalf of people residing inside the forest and opposes the formation of the national park. To curb the supposed naxalite activity inside the premises, police opened fire on activists and killed five suspected naxalites on 10 July 2007.\n\nThe Kudremukh range was declared a tiger reserve, as part of the Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary by the Union Environmental Minister, Government of India.\n\nA diverse assemblage of endangered large mammals is found in the park supporting three large mammal predator species such as the tiger, leopard and wild dog. The important tiger prey base found within the park is gaur, sambar, wild pig, muntjac, chevrotain, bonnet macaque, common langur and the lion-tailed macaque.\n\nThe wet climate and the tremendous water retentive capacity of the shola grasslands and forests have led to the formation of thousands of perennial streams in the region converging to form three major rivers of the region, Tunga, Bhadra and Nethravathi which form an important lifeline for the people of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Lobo's house is an old abandoned farm on the upper reaches of Kuduremukha.\n\nThe Kudremukh township developed primarily as an iron ore mining town where the government ran Kudremukh Iron Ore Company Ltd. (KIOCL). This public sector company operated for almost 30 years but was closed in 2006 due to environmental issues. The company proposed eco-tourism in the area and insisted that the land lease be renewed for 99 years. However, environmentalists opposed such an idea on the grounds that the area should be given time to regenerate completely rest. Thus, the mining lease lapsed on 24 July 1999.. The mining town now known as Kudremukha was earlier Malleshwara village whose residents have relocated to Jamble village of Mudigere taluk in the 1970s.. Mining town had 3 schools named Giri Jyothi Convent School, Kendriya Vidyala & Government school, which had an education from Nursery to class 12.\n\n India census, Kudremukh town had a population of 8095. Males constitute 54% of the population, while females constitute 46%. Kudremukh has an average literacy rate of 80%, which is higher than the national average of 59.5%; male literacy is 83% while female literacy is 77%. 11% of the population is under six years of age.\n\nKudremukh Iron Ore Company Limited (KIOCL) is a government-run company which was mining iron ore from the Kudremukh hills. KIOCL conducted its operations on an area of 4,604.55 ha for over 20 years. Opposition to its activities built up over the years from environmentalists and wildlife conservationists who were concerned about the threat to the region's flora and fauna, and farmers who were affected by the pollution of the streams that originated in the mining area. KIOCL has been banned from operating in this beautiful Natural Reserve, according to a Supreme Court order.\n\nThe rainfall in Kudremukh, which is one of the highest for any open cast mining operation in the world, greatly accentuates the impacts of siltation as claimed by environmentalists. The topographic and rainfall characteristics in combination with the open cast mining of low grade iron ore and other land-surface disturbances caused by the KIOCL operations resulted in very high sediment discharge, with over 60% of the total siltation in the Bhadra system being contributed by the mining area which forms less than six percent of the catchment. With high-quality practices adopted by KIOCL to mine, the flora and fauna remained intact, causing no adverse effects on nature.\n\nKIOCL used to send iron ore through pipes running through districts of Udupi and Dakshina Kannada and converted to pellets at their plant in Panambur.\n\n\n"}

He has also played top flight football in Russia, Spain and England. He was described by José Mari Bakero, the sporting director of Real Sociedad, one of his former clubs, as \"fast and explosive, the classic left winger but with technical discipline\", while he has claimed himself that his speed is his greatest asset.\n\nHe made his international debut in 2003, and was selected from Chile for three Copa América tournaments and the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\n\nGonzález was born in Durban, South Africa. His father Raúl was a professional footballer for Durban Bush Bucks, and named him after his friends and fellow footballers Mark Tovey and Dennis Wicks. He left South Africa aged 10 in 1994 and moved back to Chile with his mother.\n\nGonzález had agreed a move to Liverpool on loan for the 2005–06 season (with a view to a permanent £1.5 million move) from Albacete. However, he was denied a work permit by the Department of Education and Employment in August 2005. The Liverpool management showed great faith in González, pursuing his services despite work permit troubles and a cruciate knee ligament injury. After a quicker-than-expected return to fitness, Liverpool were persuaded to make the move permanent in October 2005, but the player was immediately loaned back to Albacete to continue his recuperation after an appeal against the earlier work permit decision was rejected (a new work permit application can only be put forward one year after the original application). Arrangements were then made for the player to spend a loan spell at Real Sociedad until summer 2006.\n\nGonzález was presented on loan at Real Sociedad on 30 January 2006, until 30 June, alongside Jhon Viáfara, whom the club had loaned from Portsmouth. González said that at Sociedad he would aim to improve his tactical play.\n\nAt Sociedad, González put in some good performances, most notably against Real Madrid, against whom he scored Sociedad's equaliser as the game finished 1–1. He played 16 league games for Sociedad and scored five goals. Sociedad showed interest in taking him permanently, along with several other La Liga clubs, but González is quoted to have said, \"I am very thankful to Real Sociedad and their coach José Mari Bakero, but while they'd like me to stay I'm going to England to join Liverpool.\"\n\nOn 5 July 2006, González was granted a work permit, and was allowed to start his Liverpool career, wearing the number 11 shirt. His manager, Rafael Benítez, said, \"This is very good news for us and I am absolutely delighted to welcome Mark González to Liverpool as he is a player the supporters will like to see.\" González made his first appearance as a half-time substitute for fellow debutant Fábio Aurélio in a pre-season friendly away against Crewe Alexandra on 22 July.\n\nGonzález made his competitive debut on 9 August 2006 against Israeli side Maccabi Haifa, coming off the bench in the 85th minute for Steven Gerrard and scoring an 88th-minute winner in Liverpool's Champions League 3rd Round Qualifier to seal a 2–1 win. He scored his first Premier League goal in Liverpool's 3–0 win over Tottenham Hotspur on his first league start for the club on 23 September. He scored just once more for Liverpool, in a 4–0 win over Fulham on 10 December.\n\nGonzález was injured inside the first ten minutes of the quarter-finals of the League Cup against Arsenal on 9 January 2007 as a result of a challenge on Theo Walcott. He was brought off on a stretcher for Luis García, who was also taken off injured later in the match as Liverpool lost 3–6. He played his last game for Liverpool on 5 May 2007 against Fulham in a 1–0 defeat.\n\nOn 24 May 2007, Rafael Benítez confirmed that Liverpool had almost reached an agreement with Real Betis over the Chilean winger. On 12 June, González confirmed that he had signed a contract for £5 million with Real Betis, who presented him to the press and fans on 17 July 2007. He went on to score on his home debut with a penalty goal in the 1–0 victory over Champions League holders Milan in the Centenary Match in front of 55,000 fans. González scored in a famous 2–1 victory over high-flying Real Madrid to steer Betis out of the relegation zone in La Liga. He ultimately scored ten goals in 44 first-team appearances for the club. Betis received an offer of €11 million from an unnamed club in July 2008.\n\nIn June 2009, following the relegation of Real Betis, Greek double holders Olympiacos made an offer of €3 million to secure him a starting eleven position in their squad for the forthcoming Champions League, but CSKA Moscow offered €6.5 million and on 11 August 2009, he signed a five-year deal with the Russian club. He debuted for the club on 16 August 2009 in a league match away to Lokomotiv Moscow.\n\nOn 6 December 2010, it was reported that he had been accused of rape in Moscow. However, later the same day the investigators announced that the accused was an unrelated Portuguese citizen named Mario Gonzalez, who is also allegedly a professional footballer.\n\nOn 21 January 2014, CSKA announced that González had left them to join Universidad Católica in Chile on loan.\nIn December 2014, González had his CSKA contract terminated by mutual consent.\n\nOriginally a loan, González joined his first professional club Universidad Católica in Chile in January 2015 after spending ten years abroad. After the mutual termination of his contract at CSKA, he joined Católica on a permanent move as a free agent. He helped the team with nine goals in the campaign, which Católica won. It was also González's first Primera División win after previously finishing second in the 2002 Clausura.\n\nGonzález signed a new one-year deal with Católica for the 2015–16 season.\n\nOn 4 January 2016, González rescinded his contract at Universidad Católica and joined Brazilian club Sport Recife for the next two years.

Initially enthusiastic about the Revolution, he became disenchanted with the disestablishment of the Catholic Church and retired to his estates in Beaupreau. He was the second commander in chief of the \"Royal and Catholic Army\" formed by Royalist forces of the Vendean insurrection against the Republic and the French Revolution.\n\nMaurice d'Elbee was born in Dresden, Electorate of Saxony to a French family in 1752. He moved to France in 1777, becoming a naturalised citizen and joining the French Royal Army. He embarked on a military career, reaching the rank of lieutenant, but resigned from the army in 1783 and married, thereafter living a retired country life near Beaupréau in Anjou. He then served as an officer in the army of Frederick Augustus I, the Prince-Elector of Saxony. After the Revolution, he returned in obedience to the law which ordered emigrants to return to France.\n\nThe peasantry and much of the middle class in the Vendée remained loyal to the Catholic Church and, in 1792, the Marquess de la Rouërie had organized a general rising, although this was frustrated by the count's arrest. However, when the Convention decreed the levee en masse of 300,000 men, the Vendée mounted a war against what they considered the atheist Republic. The peasants of Beaupréau to appoint him as their leader. His troop joined those of François de Charette, Charles Bonchamps, Jacques Cathelineau and Jean-Nicolas Stofflet. The army experienced several successes: Stofflet defeated the republic army at St. Vincent; D'Elbée and Bonchamps won at Beaupreau; and Henri de la Rochejaquelein won the victories at the Aubiers and First Cholet. He is famous for his actions after the Battle of Chemillé, on 11 April 1793: after the insurgents' victory, many of them planned to avenge their dead and slaughter the Republican prisoners (approx. 400). D'Elbée tried to prevent them, and eventually asked them to recite the Our Father, which they did; then, when they had reached the sentence \"And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who have trespassed against us\", he interrupted them with the words: \"Do not lie to God!\". Moved by this reproach, his men turned away, and d'Elbée was able to save the prisoners. This episode has since become known as \"\"Le Pater d'Elbée\"\" (d'Elbée's \"Pater Noster\").\n\nBy spring 1793, the insurgents controlled the province of Brittany. On 2 June, LaRochejacquelin stormed Saumur and Cathelineau was elected as commander in chief. D'Elbée was the top deputy of Cathelineau. The eight-year-old Louis XVII held in the Temple prison in Paris, the son of the executed Louis XVI, was proclaimed king of France, and Charette and Cathelineu united their armies to advance upon Nantes. When Cathelineau knelt at the town square to thank God for their victories, he was killed by a Republican sniper on 14 July 1793; d'Elbée replaced him as generalissimo. A skillful general, he led the small Vendéan army to several victories, most notably at Coron and Torfou. Even at his loss at the Battle of Luçon (19 August 1793), he managed to extract his force from danger. At the Battle of Luçon he managed to extricate the Royalist force from a potential rout, but suffered a significant reverse.\n\nThe Republican government in Paris entrusted its fighting to generals of the old army. Westermann was sent against them first, but on July 5 he was driven from Chatillon and suspended by the representatives on mission. After his dismissal, some of the most incompetent generals of the old army sought to defeat the rebellion. He was succeeded by the Duke of Lauzun, General Biron, who was no more successful, and who was dismissed less than a week later; the committee then sent Jean Antoine Rossignol, formerly a goldsmith's apprentice, Antoine Joseph Santerre, a brewer, and Charles-Philippe Ronsin, a playwright; all were beaten in successive battles, although Rossignol managed to hang on to his command.\n\nEventually, Jean Baptiste Kléber took command of the Republic army in the Vendée and inflicted a series of defeats. Following the Second Battle at Cholet (17 October 1793), he was badly wounded and Bonchamps was killed. Afterwards d'Elbée was transported first to Beaupréau, then the island of Noirmoutier. Three months later, the Republicans took control of the island and brought him before a military commission for a show trial. Condemned to death, he was executed by firing squad in the public square of the town of Noirmoutier. He was shot sitting in a chair, since he was unable to stand due to his fourteen wounds. Rochejaquelein, (1772–1794) a former royal cavalry officer, succeeded him as general of the Vendéan force.\n\nHe was married to Marguerite Charlotte Holly Hauterive on 17 November 1788 in the Church of the Gaubretière, and therefore lived retired in a country very close to Beaupréau in Anjou. Marguerite d'Elbée was shot twenty days following the execution of her husband in January 1794 and buried in a sunken road. The remains of her body were discovered by chance much later.\n\nHis son Louis-Joseph Maurice d'Elbée was born on 12 March 1793. Louis-Joseph Maurice d'Elbée was raised in Beaupréau. He served in the armies of Napoleon, where he distinguished himself in the Battle of Leipzig and the Battle of Hanau. Wounded in Hanau, he was taken prisoner and transported to the Potsdam hospital where he died the following year.\n\nThe chair d'Elbée was executed in remained within his family until 1975, when his relative Marquis Charles Maurice d'Elbée donated the chair to the Vendée Museum in the Château de Noirmoutier.\n"}

{"id": "2149045", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2149045", "title": "Development geography", "text": "Development geography\n\nDevelopment geography is a branch of geography which refers to the standard of living and its quality of life of its human inhabitants. In this context, development is a process of change that affects people's lives. It may involve an improvement in the quality of life as perceived by the people undergoing change. However, development is not always a positive process. Gunder Frank commented on the global economic forces that lead to the development of underdevelopment. This is covered in his dependency theory.\n\nIn development geography, geographers study spatial patterns in development. They try to find by what characteristics they can measure development by looking at economic, political and social factors. They seek to understand both the geographical \"causes\" and \"consequences\" of varying development. Studies compare More Economically Developed Countries (MEDCs) with Less Economically Developed Countries (LEDCs). Additionally variations within countries are looked at such as the differences between northern and southern Italy, the Mezzogiorno.\n\nQuantitative indicators are numerical indications of development.\n\nQualitative indicators include descriptions of living conditions and people's quality of life. They are useful in analyzing features that are not easily calculated or measured in numbers such as freedom, corruption, or security, which are largely non-material benefits.\n\nThere is a considerable spatial variation in development rates.\n\nThe most famous pattern in development is the North-South divide. The North-South divide separates the rich North or the developed world, from the poor South. This line of division is not as straightforward as it sounds and splits the globe into two main parts. It is also known as the Brandt Line.\n\nThe \"North\" in this divide is regarded as being North America, Europe, Russia, South Korea, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and the like. The countries within this area are generally the more economically developed. The \"South\" therefore encompasses the remainder of the Southern Hemisphere, mostly consisting of KFCs. Another possible dividing line is the Tropic of Cancer with the exceptions of Australia and New Zealand. It is critical to understand that the status of countries is far from static and the pattern is likely to become distorted with the fast development of certain southern countries, many of them NICs (Newly Industrialised Countries) including India, Thailand, Brazil, Malaysia, Mexico and others. These countries are experiencing sustained fast development on the back of growing manufacturing industries and exports.\n\nMost countries are experiencing significant increases in wealth and standard of living. However, there are unfortunate exceptions to this rule. Noticeably some of the former Soviet Union countries has experienced major disruption of industry in the transition to a market economy. Many African nations have recently experienced reduced GNPs due to wars and the AIDS epidemic, including Angola, Congo, Sierra Leone and others. Arab oil producers rely very heavily on oil exports to support their GDPs so any reduction in oil's market price can lead to rapid decreases in GNP. Countries which rely on only a few exports for much of their income are very vulnerable to changes in the market value of those commodities and are often derogatively called banana republics. Many developing countries do rely on exports of a few primary goods for a large amount of their income (coffee and timber for example), and this can create havoc when the value of these commodities drops, leaving these countries with no way to pay off their debts.\n\nWithin countries the pattern is that wealth is more concentrated around urban areas than rural areas. Wealth also tends towards areas with natural resources or in areas that are involved in tertiary (service) industries and trade. This leads to a gathering of wealth around mines and monetary centres such as New York, London and Tokyo.\n\nGeography can also affect economic development in a number of ways. Analysis of current data sets show three significant implications of geography on developing nations. First, access to sea routes is important; this has been noted as far back as Adam Smith. Sea travel is much cheaper and faster than that of land, leading to a wider and quicker dissemination of both resources and ideas, both of which are integral to economic stimulus. Geography also dictates the prevalence of disease: for example, the World Health Organization estimates roughly 300-500 million new cases of malaria every year. Malaria is largely associated with nations that have struggled to achieve sound economic development. Not only does disease decrease labor productivity, but it changes the age structure of the country, forcing the population to lean heavily toward children as adults die from disease and the population sees an increase of fertility to keep up with the high death rates. High fertility both lowers the quality of life for each child due to a decrease in resources allocated to each of them, and also decreases labor productivity for women. The third way geography affects development is through agricultural productivity. Temperate regions have shown the highest output of major grains; regions such as the African savanna relatively yield much less value for the labor cost. Low agricultural output means that a larger portion of the population must spend their efforts in agriculture, leading to a slower urban development. This, in turn, discourages technological advance: an essential source of development for the twenty-first century.\n\nGeographers along with other social scientists have recognized that certain factors present in a given society may impede the social and economic development of that society. Factors, which have been identified as obstructing the economic and social welfare of developing societies, include:\n\n\nEffective governments may address many barriers to economic and social development, however in many instances this is challenging due to the path dependency societies develop regarding many of these issues. Some barriers to development may be impossible to address, such as climatic barriers to development. In these cases societies must evaluate whether such climatic barriers to development dictate that society must relocate a given settlement in order to enjoy greater economic development.\n\nMany scholars agree that foreign aid provided to developing nations is ineffective and in many instances counter productive. This is due to the manner in which foreign aid changes the incentives for productivity in a given developing society, and the manner in which foreign aid has the tendency to corrupt the governments responsible for its allocation and distribution.\n\nCultural barriers to development such as discrimination based on gender, race, religion, or sexual orientation are challenging to address in certain oppressive societies, though recent progress has been significant in some societies.\n\nWhile the aforementioned barriers to economic growth and development are most prevalent in the less developed economies of the world, even the most developed economies are plagued by select barriers to development such as drug prohibition and income inequality.\n\nMEDCs (More Economically Developed Countries) can give aid to LEDCs (Less Economically Developed Countries). There are several types of aid:\n\nAid can be given in several ways. Through money, materials, or skilled and learned people (e.g. teachers).\n\nAid has advantages. Mostly short-term or emergency aid help people in LEDCs to survive a natural (earthquake, tsunami, volcano eruption etc.) or human (civil war etc.) disaster. Aid helps make the recipient country (the country that receives aid) get more developed.\n\nHowever, aid also has disadvantages. Often aid does not even reach the poorest people. Often money gained from aid is used up to make infrastructures (bridges, roads etc.), which only the rich can use. Also, the recipient country becomes more dependent on aid from a donor country (the country giving aid).\n\nWhilst the above conception of aid has been the most pervasive within development geography work, it is important to remember that the aid landscape is far more complex than one directional flows from 'developed' to 'developing' countries. Development geographers have been at the forefront of research that aims to understand both the material exchanges and discourse surrounding 'South-South' development cooperation. 'Non-traditional' foreign aid from Southern, Middle Eastern and post-Socialist states (those outside the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD) provide alternative development discourses and approaches to that of the mainstream Western model. Development geographers seek to examine the geopolitical drivers behind the aid donor programmes of \"LEDCs\", as well as the discursive symbolic repertoires of non-DAC donor states. Two illustrative examples of the complex aid landscape are that of China, which has been active as an aid donor throughout the latter half of the twentieth century but published its first report on foreign aid policy as recently as 2011 and India, an often cited aid recipient, but which has had donor programmes to Nepal and Bhutan since the 1950s.\n\n"}

He made an AM radio receiver inside a soap case, at a time when phonographs were the fad of the time. Thomas's talent astonished others, whereas his father saw them as a waste of time. He always compared his son to the best student in the class – Balu, adding to his pressure. His father asked his language teacher Ravunni master to grade his paper so as to fail him, on the belief that only low grades will provoke him to study harder. When Thomas found this, he became outraged and ran away from the village, after stabbing Balu on the palm with a compass. Fourteen years later, he returned as a changed man, no longer a prodigy.

Chacko master secretly visit his son in the hospital with regret. Coming back to health, Thoma's attempt at revenge is foiled when Thulasi interferes. On learning that Thulasi loves him, he try to prevent her. With her help, he tries to back out from his wrong course of life.

It was directed by Academy Award-winning filmmaker James Cameron after his 1997 Oscar-winning film \"Titanic\". During August and September 2001, Cameron and a group of scientists staged an expedition to the wreck of the RMS \"Titanic\", and dived in Russian deep-submersibles to obtain more detailed images than anyone had before. With the help of two small, purpose-built remotely operated vehicles, nicknamed \"Jake\" and \"Elwood\", the audience too can see inside the \"Titanic\", and with the help of CGI, audiences can view the ship's original appearance superimposed on the deep-dive images.\n\nAlso along for the ride Cameron invited his friend, actor Bill Paxton, who played Brock Lovett in the 1997 film. Paxton narrates the event through his eyes. The film premiered for IMAX 3D and was nominated for a BFCA award for Best Documentary. The submersibles Mir 1 and Mir 2 carried the filming team on 12 dives.\n\nThe film is also known as Titanic 3D: Ghosts of the Abyss.\n\nDirector James Cameron returns to the site of the 1912 wreck of the RMS \"Titanic\", aboard the Russian research vessel \"Akademik Mstislav Keldysh\". With a team of history and marine experts, and his friend Bill Paxton, he embarks on an adventure back to the final grave of 1,517 people killed in 1912. Using technology developed for this expedition, Cameron and his crew are able to explore virtually all of the wreckage, inside and out, as never before. This documentary was made for IMAX 3D theatres and specially outfitted 35 mm 3D theaters. Cameron and his team bring audiences to sights not seen since the sinking and explore why the vessel continues to intrigue and fascinate the public. While diving on September 11, 2001, the filming crew hears about the 9/11/2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Afterward, they all compare and reflect on the tragedy of 9/11 with the tragedy of the \"Titanic.\"\n\nThroughout the movie, there are re-enactments of events that are discussed that use CGI recreations of the interior of the \"Titanic\".\n\nThe film was screened out of competition at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe film grossed $17,093,668 in the United States and $11,687,000 worldwide, for a total gross of $28,780,668.\n\nThe feature film on the DVD is 90 minutes long and is available in a two-disc edition and as the fifth disc in the Titanic five-Disc Deluxe Limited Edition.\n\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the film on a three-disc Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray and DVD edition on September 11, 2012.\n\n\"Rolling Stone\" included the documentary in its list of the best 3D movies ever, in 2012.\n\nThe official soundtrack's score were composed and conducted by Joel McNeely, and the orchestrations were conducted by David Brown, Marshall Bowen, and Frank Macchia. The album was also recorded and mixed by Rich Breen, edited by Craig Pettigrew, and mastered by Pat Sullivan. The album was ultimately produced by James Cameron, Randy Gerston and Joel McNeely and released by Disney's Hollywood Records label. Part of the film was filmed in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.\n\nToad The Wet Sprocket lead singer and songwriter Glen Phillips contributed the opening track, \"Departure\". James Cameron loved the band's 1991 track \"Nightingale Song\" but found Columbia Records' licensing fee too high (it wanted over $5,000 for the use of the one minute he wanted to use) so he contacted the band's management hoping they could re-record it for his film, only to find they had broken up in 1998 and could not. However, during the negotiations Cameron asked if Phillips would be interested in writing a new track in the spirit of the older song and \"Departure\" was created. it was produced, mixed, and all instruments played by Phillips in his garage studio though this was not credited in the CD booklet.\n\n"}

{"id": "2149121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2149121", "title": "Trapster", "text": "Trapster\n\nTrapster (Peter Petruski) is a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.\n\nThe character is one of the first supervillains who became active during the \"Silver Age\" of Marvel Comics. He makes his first appearance as Paste-Pot Pete in \"Strange Tales\" #104 (January 1963), and as the Trapster in \"Fantastic Four\" #38.\n\nPeter Petruski was born in Gary, Indiana. Originally calling himself Paste-Pot Pete, the villain and professional criminal clashed with the Human Torch during his efforts to sell a new American missile to the Soviets. However he escaped by using his paste to catch the wing of a plane, then diving into the sea.\n\nFollowing a failed solo effort against Human Torch, Paste-Pot Pete broke out of jail and teamed with the Wizard in efforts to trump his youthful foe. However Paste-Pot Pete was angered over Wizard acting as the team's leader. Wizard framed Human Torch for a robbery. They got Human Torch to Wizard's house and used compressed air to force him into a chamber of steel mirrors, planning to fill the place with a gas that would cut off the oxygen supply of the Torch. However, Human Torch melted through the paste that held him to the floor, created a flaming duplicate to fool the two, then increased his flame enabling him to burn through the mirrors. The villains only realized this deception when the fake Human Torch faded away due to the gas, by which time Human Torch had regained his flame and captured the two in a flaming ring.\n\nPete later provided the Avengers with a solvent to dissolve Baron Zemo's Adhesive X, and was paroled from prison. He adopted a new costume and weaponry, and battled Human Torch and the Thing using new paste types. He captured Thing, then Human Torch, but was still defeated. Wizard and Pete would eventually team with the criminal Sandman and the Inhuman Medusa as the Frightful Four to battle the Fantastic Four. It was shortly after the formation of the Frightful Four that Pete abandoned his old alias and assumed the more intimidating name Trapster (the \"Spider-Man/Human Torch\" mini-series depicts the catalyst of the name change to be Spider-Man being unable to stop laughing when Paste-Pot Pete introduced himself). The Frightful Four would clash time and again with the Fantastic Four, often enjoying some measure of success in their efforts. Over the years, the membership of the Frightful Four would vary, but the man once known as Paste-Pot Pete would serve in virtually every incarnation in which Wizard served as well, loyal to his longtime boss.\n\nHe changed his \"nom de crime\" to Trapster and appeared with new weaponry in \"Fantastic Four\" #38, with the second appearance of the Frightful Four, in an attempt to make himself sound more formidable. In this encounter, the Frightful Four was able to defeat the Fantastic Four. Over the years, a running gag in Marvel comics involved heroes and villains alike reminding Trapster of his earlier name of \"Paste-Pot Pete\" — which would inevitably send him flying into a rage. A chance encounter with Balder once prevented the Frightful Four's takeover of Fantastic Four headquarters. With the Frightful Four, he soon battled the Fantastic Four again, and then battled Daredevil. He was hired by the Red Skull to acquire information from Sharon Carter, and battled Captain America. Alongside Wizard and Sandman, he later battled Medusa. Together with Wizard, Sandman, and Medusa as the Frightful Four again, they once again battled the Fantastic Four.\n\nTrapster has often sought independent recognition, battling virtually every \"street-level\" hero in the Marvel Universe either by design or by opposition to some criminal scheme. Trapster once even defeated Daredevil in single combat. The victory proved short-lived, as Doctor Doom interrupted his fight in a campaign of his own against Daredevil, and shortly thereafter the hero would avenge his defeat. Trapster also attempted to raid the Baxter Building (just before it was destroyed by the second Doctor Doom) while the Fantastic Four were away participating in the Secret Wars, but embarrassingly fell victim to the security systems and the robot receptionist, thus becoming the first villain to be defeated by an empty building. However, he had a moment appreciated by the heroes when he was convinced to free Captain America and Giant-Man who were snared by Heinrich Zemo's powerful Adhesive X, by inventing the first ever means to neutralize the previously uncounterable chemical.\n\nSaddened by constant defeats, Trapster would seek out the Tinkerer's aid in redesigning his arsenal. Adding wrist-pumps for his glue weaponry and a bandolier of various explosives and gimmicks, Trapster joined forces with the mutant villain Whirlwind in a bid to defeat Captain America. Despite his improved arsenal, both villains were defeated.\n\nThe Trapster found his moment of victory over Spider-Man when he teamed up with the Shocker but, before the duo could finish Spider-Man off, their employers said their payment would be doubled if they left Spider-Man alone and they complied. He would later defeat Spider-Man in one-on-one combat after being enlisted to battle the wall-crawler as part of the \"Acts of Vengeance\" conspiracy; it was only through the merest quirk of fate that Spider-Man even survived the battle. However, when the Trapster learned of Spider-Man's survival and returned to finish the job, he would find the web-slinger now in possession of cosmic powers (eventually revealed to be a manifestation of the Uni-Power) with which Trapster was easily defeated.\n\nLater on, during the \"Identity Crisis\" story, Trapster would be hired by Norman Osborn to kill a man and make it seem like Spider-Man did it, and, in order to cover this up, Osborn put a price on Trapster's head, attracting assassins like the Hand and his previous ally Shocker. Trapster unknowingly teamed up with Spider-Man - now using the Dusk alias-reasoning that the currently-lone Trapster would need an ally and someone to talk to in his currently vulnerable state—in an attempt to get back at Osborn, and would eventually confess his murder to the police in order to remove Osborn's reason for wanting him dead (although he kept the identity of his employer secret in case he needed it later).\n\nDuring his tenure with a later Frightful Four incarnation (including Hydro-Man and the mysterious Salamandra), Wizard, tired of Trapster's failures and his general sniveling, callously sealed the villain in a repeating time-loop, a trap from which he can \"never escape.\" However, Petruski did indeed escape.\n\nDuring the \"Secret War\" storyline, Trapster was enlisted by Lucia von Bardas, the former prime minister of Latveria, and placed in her secret army of technology-based villains. She sent the army against Wolverine, Spider-Man, Luke Cage, Daredevil, and Captain America, the five heroes Nick Fury had sent to Latveria to stop Lucia’s secret criminal funding. When the battle started to turn in favor of the heroes, Lucia turned all the armor of her technological army into a bomb. Nick’s unknown agent Daisy defeated her and the armor army’s lives were saved. Trapster escaped the heroes in the resulting battle between Fury and Wolverine.\n\nDuring the \"Civil War\" storyline, Trapster was seen as a member of the Sinister Six. He was later among an army of supervillains organized by Hammerhead that was captured by Iron Man and S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nAfter the Civil War, Trapster appeared as a member of a new 'Frightful Five', along with Wizard, Hydro-Man, Titania, and Klaw.\n\nHe appeared in \"\" as one of the villains in the bar, and later fighting Spider-Man in the \"Brand New Day\" Extra one-shot.\n\nDuring the \"Dark Reign\" storyline, Trapster later showed up in an alliance with the criminal Zodiac.\n\nTrapster was with the Frightful Four when they were sent by Intelligencia to attack the Baxter Building and capture Mister Fantastic.\n\nAfter MODOK Superior had revived the other Intelligencia members following the fight with the Sinister Six, he makes room for Trapster to join up with them. Their meeting was interrupted by Deadpool (who tried to sink the ship they were on) only for Trapster to defeat Deadpool.\n\nWhen Peter Parker (in Doctor Octopus' dying body) sends a message to various supervillains to capture Otto Octavius (in Spider-Man's body) alive in order bring to the Raft, Trapster is among the supervillains that receives the message. Trapster places who he believes to be Doctor Octopus in a portable life-support system that he had put together. Trapster teleports Peter, Hydro-Man, and Scorpion to one of Doctor Octopus' hideouts and then asks for the pay. But Peter reminds them that they have to capture Spider-Man alive and bring before \"Doctor Octopus\" (in order to find a way to switch Peter's and Otto's minds back). Trapster was later found webbed up at the hideout by the police with a note stating \"Courtesy of your friendly neighborhood Doc Ock\".\n\nAt a supervillain nightclub as part of the \"All-New, All-Different Marvel\", Trapster encountered his sometime-teammate in the Frightful Four Titania who addresses him as \"Paste-Pot Pete\". He ambushes Titania in an alley outside, attempting to rob her, but Titania easily defeats him.\n\nDuring the \"\" storyline, Trapster was an inmate of Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D. Using the Kobik project, S.H.I.E.L.D. transformed Trapster into a mild-mannered Pleasant Hill groundskeeper named Willie. Baron Zemo and Fixer restored his memory and he helped to assault a S.H.I.E.L.D. outpost that was used as the Pleasant Hill City Hall.\n\nThe Trapster does not possess any superhuman powers, but relies on a variety of technological devices. He designed a costume of synthetic stretch fabric equipped with storage canisters for paste and lubricant, and adhesive-rigged boots and gloves to enable walking up walls. His primary weapon has always been projectile glue, initially delivered by a pistol connected by an armored tubing to a container on his person, then wrist paste-shooter cannons, and eventually shot straight from the tips of his gloves. He can shoot out a stream of liquid glue that immediately gels into a springy rope, allowing him to duplicate Spider-Man's web-shooters (to the point where he is the only person Spider-Man knows who can even create an approximate duplicate of his webbing). He was able to create a fire-proof paste. Pete also has designed boots that allow him to walk up walls by sequentially releasing a powerful glue and then a solvent. Petruski has also created lubricants that can render a surface frictionless, and discovered a way to dissolve the extremely powerful \"Adhesive X\" created by Baron Heinrich Zemo. Pete has also created a dust capable of rendering Mister Fantastic's unstable molecules inert. Trapster is an expert chemist, a skilled marksman, and a talented disguise artist. He has used other devices such as anti-gravity discs, explosive caps, ultrasound transmitters, an anti-gravity platform, and various mechanical traps used to restrain or entangle opponents.\n\nLawrence \"Larry\" Curtiss is a different version of Trapster that appeared in \"Iron Man Annual\" #12. Known as \"Trapster\", he was the assistant head of security for the Roxxon Oil Company and stole Peter Petruski's costume and weapons. He also had heat-seeking mini-missiles equipped with concussion charges and glue missiles (fired from paste-shooters). He used the Trapster's equipment to steal the inventions programs from Iron Man and desired to replace his boss as the head of security at Roxxon. However, he was discovered by his boss and defeated by Iron Man.\n\nA third Trapster crashed a battle between Spider-Man and Vulture who was using the Falcon alias at the time. She immobilized both of them and made off with Vulture's loot.\n\nTrapster appears as a member of the female incarnation of the Sinister Syndicate where she was called \"Trapstr\". While on her cellphone, she quotes that there is no E in her name as she is still trying to decide on replacing it with the letter A. The Sinister Syndicate begins their mission where they attack the F.E.A.S.T. building that Boomerang is volunteering at. Beetle leads the Sinister Syndicate in attacking Boomerang. After getting Aunt May to safety, Peter Parker changes into Spider-Man and helps Boomerang fight the Syndicate. The Syndicate starts doing their formation attack until Spider-Man accidentally sets off Boomerang's gaserang which knocks out Spider-Man enough for the Syndicate to make off with Boomerang. Trapstr's paste was used to trap Boomerang in their headquarters. When Beetle returns to the headquarters, Trapstr is present when Mayor Wilson Fisk brings the full force of New York City to their headquarters demanding that they surrender Boomerang to him. She wonders if an attractive police officer named Rob is down there. Trapstr later stated that she learned about Beetle's boyfriend Randy Robertson by hacking her e-mails. The Syndicate then assists Spider-Man against Mayor Fisk's forces. After Spider-Man evacuates Boomerang, the Syndicate fights Mayor Fisk's forces while not killing them. The Syndicate is defeated and arrested by the police. Their transport is then attacked by an unknown assailant who frees them.\n\nA variation on the Trapster appears in \"\" as one of the members of the 1602 Frightful Four: \"The Four who are Frightful\". He is an expert huntsman, hence his name.\n\nPeter appears as a bird called Paste Pot Peep in \"Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham\" #16.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1143 another Richwin is mentioned, although it is unclear if it is the son of the former Richwin or if it was the former Richwin. Either way, his son Sigfried is considered the founder of the state of Isenburg-Kempenich in 1142. In 1152 Siegfried had his daughters entered into a monastery. Through marriage, Isenburg-Kempenich passed to Reynold of the House of Isenburg in 1153.\n\nIn 1158 the Lords Theodoric I and Florentin are mentioned in a document of the Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa. Both lords are mentioned in 1166 and 1173, but only Florentin was mentioned in 1183 and in 1187. Inheritance passed to the sons of Theodoric I after Florentin's death, Salentin, Rosemann and Theodoric II. Salentin died sometime after 1213 leaving Rosemann as the most powerful of the three lords. Isenburg-Kempenich benefited greatly from their close relation to Henry II of Isenburg-Grenzau, one of the most powerful lords in the region.\n\nIn 1277, Gerard I made his lordship mediate to the Archbishopric of Trier. After the death of Gerard's son Theodoric IV, a bloody succession dispute broke out in 1330 between the sons of Theodoric, Simon I and Theodoric V, and their cousin Gerard II after Simon took the lordship for himself. Gerard brought his friends into the dispute, Gerard of Landskron, John of Rheineck, Theodoric of Schönberg, and George of Eich. On 26 February 1331 the Archbishop of Trier also joined Gerard. Simon and Theodoric likewise brought allies into the conflict, and the entire lordship was devastated. Eventually the Archbishop excommunicated Simon after he had a church burned down after trying to use it to exert pressure on the other side.\n\nThe dispute was settled with the Peace of Lahnstein on 11 June 1331 after the Archbishop of Trier died and was succeeded by Baldwin of Luxembourg. Simon was left the sole ruler of Kempenich and it was decreed the lordship could no longer be partitioned. Simon I was succeeded by his son Simon II in 1341, and his brother John respected the treaty. But after the death of Simon II his sons Simon II, Theodoric VI, John and Henry co-ruled the lordship. Henry appears to have died almost immediately, and Theodoric VI was not mentioned after 1378. Simon died in 1420 without descendants, and after John died in 1424 Kempenich passed to the Lords of Schöneck. In 1434 it passed to the Archbishop of Trier, who sold the territory to the Counts of Virneburg.\n"}

McCarthy is perhaps best known for officiating numerous bouts promoted by the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), dating back to UFC 2.\n\nThe nickname of 'Big John' came about because of his size and stature. He stands 6'3\" and weighs 260 lb; making him larger than the majority of the athletes over whom he presides. According to a UFC interview, the nickname was given to him by UFC co-founder and promoter Art Davie. McCarthy recalls that the nickname began when he forcibly lifted Davie off the ground and held him in the air.\n\nMcCarthy was the most senior referee in the UFC and is well known for his delivery of \"Let's Get It On!\", a catchphrase created by boxing referee Mills Lane. McCarthy served as one of the head referees for nearly every fight in the UFC from UFC 2 until UFC 77, and was considered as much a part of the UFC as the octagonal arena itself as he was the key figure in the writing of the current Unified Rules for the sport of MMA, which is now recognized by the ABC and Athletic Commissions across North America. His 535th bout was the main event at \"\" finale in Las Vegas, Roger Huerta vs. Clay Guida. McCarthy briefly retired after this bout to pursue a career as a commentator for The Fight Network but returned to officiating just a year later. Since his return, McCarthy has refereed for promotions all over the globe including the UFC, K-1 (Japan), Strikeforce, Affliction, Bellator, King of the Cage and a multitude of others.\n\nHis connection to the UFC was attributed to his relationship with the Gracie family, particularly Rorion Gracie. McCarthy had been training Brazilian jiu-jitsu under Rorion at the Gracie Academy in Torrance, CA in the early 1990s, and was designated a certified \"GRAPLE\" (Gracie Resisting Attack Procedures for Law Enforcement) instructor by the Gracie Academy in December 1993.\n\nWhen Rorion Gracie was putting together his new fighting promotion in 1993, McCarthy expressed interest in fighting for the UFC, but Gracie advised against it; however, due to his experience in law enforcement, McCarthy was seen as a fitting man to referee. He debuted at \"UFC 2: No Way Out\" in 1994.\n\nThe early days of UFC did not contain many rules; McCarthy's role was only to supervise the fight and to ensure that it ended promptly when a competitor either submitted (also known as tap out), was knocked out, or had his towel thrown in. Although first disfavored by UFC executives, after UFC 2 McCarthy insisted on referee stoppages when a fighter cannot intelligently defend himself.\n\nOn December 31, 2004, McCarthy served as the referee for a fight held on the K-1 Dynamite! card at the Osaka Dome in Osaka, Japan between MMA legend Royce Gracie and Sumo legend-turned-fighter Akebono Taro.\n\nOn December 12, 2015, McCarthy served as the referee for UFC 194 between Conor McGregor and Jose Aldo, which became the shortest title bout (13 seconds) in UFC history.\n\nIn 2018, McCarthy retired for the second time, and moved to Bellator as a commentator.\n\n\n\nIn September 2006, John McCarthy opened his first MMA school in Valencia, California. This gym was one of the largest MMA schools in California. McCarthy sold the school in December 2015. In January 2007, he was awarded his Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt. \n\nIn early 2008, McCarthy started a referee and judging course for MMA officials called COMMAND (Certification of Officials for Mixed Martial Arts National Development).\n\nMcCarthy has three children: sons, John Michael Jr. and Ronald II (after John Sr.'s father); daughter, Britney. Ron has been an MMA judge since 2013.\n\nOn September 1, 2011, McCarthy's autobiography, \"Let's Get It On - The Making of MMA and its Ultimate Referee\", was published.\n\nMcCarthy appeared with retired MMA fighter Bas Rutten in New Found Glory's video \"Listen to Your Friends\", where he refs MMA fights between the band members. The music video, which was shot on November 5, 2008 in Los Angeles, California, premiered on March 9, 2009. He has also appeared on the \"Fight Science\" episode Super Cops on national Geographic.\n\nMcCarthy also appeared in the TV series \"Friends\", season 3 episode 24 \"The One with the Ultimate Fighting Champion\" where he plays the referee of a UFC match between Tank Abbott and Jon Favreau.\n\nMcCarthy also served as the referee on the MTV2 series \"Bully Beatdown\", along with professional mixed martial artist Jason \"Mayhem\" Miller.\n\nMcCarthy is featured in the award-winning mixed martial arts documentary \"Fight Life\", the film is directed by James Z.

NDFs are prevalent in some countries where forward FX trading has been banned by the government (usually as a means to prevent exchange rate volatility).\n\nThe NDF market is an over-the-counter market. NDFs began to trade actively in the 1990s. NDF markets developed for emerging markets with capital controls, where the currencies could not be delivered offshore. Most NDFs are cash-settled in US dollars (USD).\n\nThe more active banks quote NDFs from between one month to one year, although some would quote up to two years upon request. The most commonly traded NDF tenors are IMM dates, but banks also offer odd-dated NDFs. NDFs are typically quoted with the USD as the reference currency, and the settlement amount is also in USD.\n\nBelow is a (non-exhaustive) list of currencies where non-deliverable forwards are traded.\nNot all non-convertible currencies have a NDF market (e.g. BDT had no active market as of 2011). A currency may be convertible by some market participants while being non-convertible to others.\n\nAn NDF is a short-term, cash-settled currency forward between two counterparties. On the contracted settlement date, the profit or loss is adjusted between the two counterparties based on the difference between the contracted NDF rate and the prevailing spot FX rates on an agreed notional amount.\n\nThe features of an NDF include:\n\nBecause an NDF is a cash-settled instrument, the notional amount is never exchanged. The only exchange of cash flows is the difference between the NDF rate and the prevailing spot market rate—that is determined on the fixing date and exchanged on the settlement date—applied to the notional, i.e. cash flow = (NDF rate – spot rate) × notional.\n\nConsequently, since NDF is a \"non-cash\", off-balance-sheet item and since the principal sums do not move, NDF bears much lower counter-party risk. NDFs are committed short-term instruments; both counterparties are committed and are obliged to honor the deal. Nevertheless, either counterparty can cancel an existing contract by entering into another offsetting deal at the prevailing market rate.\n\nAn investor enters into a forward agreement to purchase a notional amount, \"N\", of the base currency at the contracted forward rate, \"F\", and would pay \"NF\" units of the quoted currency. On the fixing date, that investor would theoretically be able to sell the notional amount, \"N\", of the base currency at the prevailing spot rate, \"S\", earning \"NS\" units of the quoted currency. Therefore, the profit, formula_1, on this trade in terms of the base currency, is given by:\nThe base currency is usually the more liquid and more frequently traded currency (for example, US Dollar or Euros).\n\nNDFs can be used to create a foreign currency loan in a currency, which may not be of interest to the lender.\n\nFor example, the borrower wants dollars but wants to make repayments in euros. So, the borrower receives a dollar sum and repayments will still be calculated in dollars, but payment will be made in euros, using the current exchange rate at time of repayment.\n\nThe lender wants to lend dollars and receive repayments in dollars. So, at the same time as disbursing the dollar sum to the borrower, the lender enters into a non-deliverable forward agreement with a counterparty (for example, on the Chicago market) that matches the cash flows from the foreign currency repayments.\n\nEffectively, the borrower has a synthetic euro loan; the lender has a synthetic dollar loan; and the counterparty has an NDF contract with the lender.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, the rates achievable using synthetic foreign currency lending may be lower than borrowing in the foreign currency directly, implying that there is a possibility for arbitrage. Although this is theoretically identical to a second currency loan (with settlement in dollars), the borrower may face basis risk: the possibility that a difference arises between the swap market's exchange rate and the exchange rate on the home market. The lender also bears counterparty risk.\n\nThe borrower could, in theory, enter into NDF contracts directly and borrow in dollars separately and achieve the same result. NDF counterparties, however, may prefer to work with a limited range of entities (such as those with a minimum credit rating).\n\nIt is estimated that between 60 and 80 per cent of NDF trading is speculative. The main difference between the outright forward deals and the non-deliverable forwards is that the settlement is made in dollars since the dealer or counterparty can not settle in the alternative currency of the deal.\n\n"}

This became the British Section of the International Left Opposition and adopted the name Communist League in June 1933. They published a monthly newspaper, \"Red Flag\", and a quarterly journal, \"The Communist\".\n\nIn 1933, Leon Trotsky suggested the group should enter the Independent Labour Party, but the leadership decided against, leading to a split that December. In 1934, a small group led by Denzil Dean Harber did enter the ILP, as the Bolshevik-Leninist Fraction, and formed the core of the Marxist Group which C. L. R. James joined. Slow progress led to more splits, with the formation of the entrist Bolshevik-Leninist Group in the Labour Party, the core of the later Militant Group.\n\nThe Communist League dissolved in 1936 and its members entered the Labour Party as the Marxist League, led by Harry Wicks.

{"id": "2149148", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2149148", "title": "Municipal solid waste", "text": "Municipal solid waste\n\nMunicipal solid waste (MSW), commonly known as trash or garbage in the United States and rubbish in Britain, is a waste type consisting of everyday items that are discarded by the public. \"Garbage\" can also refer specifically to food waste, as in a garbage disposal; the two are sometimes collected separately. In the European Union, the semantic definition is 'mixed municipal waste,' given waste code 20 03 01 in the European Waste Catalog. Although the waste may originate from a number of sources that has nothing to do with a municipality, the traditional role of municipalities in collecting and managing these kinds of waste have produced the particular etymology 'municipal.'\n\nThe composition of municipal solid waste varies greatly from municipality to municipality, and it changes significantly with time. In municipalities which have a well developed waste recycling system, the waste stream mainly consists of intractable wastes such as plastic film and non-recyclable packaging materials. At the start of the 20th century, the majority of domestic waste (53%) in the UK consisted of coal ash from open fires.\nIn developed areas without significant recycling activity it predominantly includes food wastes, market wastes, yard wastes, plastic containers and product packaging materials, and other miscellaneous solid wastes from residential, commercial, institutional, and industrial sources. Most definitions of municipal solid waste do not include industrial wastes, agricultural wastes, medical waste, radioactive waste or sewage sludge. Waste collection is performed by the municipality within a given area. The term \"residual waste\" relates to waste left from household sources containing materials that have not been separated out or sent for processing. Waste can be classified in several ways but the following list represents a typical classification:\n\n\nFor example, typical municipal solid waste in China is composed of 55.9% food residue, 8.5% paper, 11.2% plastics, 3.2% textiles, 2.9% wood waste, 0.8% rubber, and 18.4% non-combustibles.\n\nThe municipal solid waste industry has four components: recycling, composting, disposal, and waste-to-energy via incineration. There is no single approach that can be applied to the management of all waste streams, therefore the Environmental Protection Agency, a U.S. federal government agency, developed a hierarchy ranking strategy for municipal solid waste. The waste management hierarchy is made up of four levels ordered from most preferred to least preferred methods based on their environmental soundness: Source reduction and reuse; recycling or composting; energy recovery; treatment and disposal.\n\nThe functional element of collection includes not only the gathering of solid waste and recyclable materials, but also the transport of these materials, after collection, to the location where the collection vehicle is emptied. This location may be a materials processing facility, a transfer station or a landfill disposal site.\n\nWaste handling and separation involves activities associated with waste management until the waste is placed in storage containers for collection. Handling also encompasses the movement of loaded containers to the point of collection. Separating different types of waste components is an important step in the handling and storage of solid waste at the source of collection.\n\nThe types of means and facilities that are now used for the recovery of waste materials that have been separated at the source include curbside ('kerbside' in the UK) collection, drop-off and buy-back centers. The separation and processing of wastes that have been separated at the source and the separation of commingled wastes usually occur at a materials recovery facility, transfer stations, combustion facilities and treatment plants.\n\nThis element involves two main steps. First, the waste is transferred from a smaller collection vehicle to larger transport equipment. The waste is then transported, usually over long distances, to a processing or disposal site.\n\nToday, the disposal of wastes by land filling or land spreading is the ultimate fate of all solid wastes, whether they are residential wastes collected and transported directly to a landfill site, residual materials from materials recovery facilities (MRFs), residue from the combustion of solid waste, compost, or other substances from various solid waste processing facilities. A modern sanitary landfill is not a dump; it is an engineered facility used for disposing of solid wastes on land without creating nuisances or hazards to public health or safety, such as the problems of insects and the contamination of ground water.\n\nIn the recent years environmental organizations, such as Freegle or Freecycle Network, have been gaining popularity for their online reuse networks. These networks provide a worldwide online registry of unwanted items that would otherwise be thrown away, for individuals and nonprofits to reuse or recycle. Therefore, this free Internet-based service reduces landfill pollution and promotes the gift economy.\n\nLandfills are created by land dumping. Land dumping methods vary, most commonly it involves the mass dumping of waste into a designated area, usually a hole or sidehill. After the waste is dumped, it is then compacted by large machines. When the dumping cell is full, it is then \"sealed\" with a plastic sheet and covered in several feet of dirt. This is the primary method of dumping in the United States because of the low cost and abundance of unused land in North America. Landfills are regulated in the US by the Environmental Protection Agency, which enforces standards provided in the Resource Conservation Recovery Act, such as requiring liners and groundwater monitoring. This is because landfills pose the threat of pollution and can contaminate ground water. The signs of pollution are effectively masked by disposal companies and it is often hard to see any evidence. Usually landfills are surrounded by large walls or fences hiding the mounds of debris. Large amounts of chemical odor eliminating agent are sprayed in the air surrounding landfills to hide the evidence of the rotting waste inside the plant.\n\nMunicipal solid waste can be used to generate energy. Several technologies have been developed that make the processing of MSW for energy generation cleaner and more economical than ever before, including landfill gas capture, combustion, pyrolysis, gasification, and plasma arc \"gasification\". While older waste incineration plants emitted a lot of pollutants, recent regulatory changes and new technologies have significantly reduced this concern. United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations in 1995 and 2000 under the Clean Air Act have succeeded in reducing emissions of dioxins from waste-to-energy facilities by more than 99 percent below 1990 levels, while mercury emissions have been reduced by over 90 percent. The EPA noted these improvements in 2003, citing waste-to-energy as a power source \"with less environmental impact than almost any other source of electricity\".\n\n\n"}

Between 2007 and 2010, Elliot was the Minister for Ageing.\n\nElliot was born in Brisbane, Queensland and was educated at the University of Queensland, where she graduated in Arts. She was a Queensland Police officer between 1990 and 1997 and was later Juvenile Justice Conference Convener with the New South Wales Department of Juvenile Justice. Elliot also holds a Graduate Diploma in Human Resource Management & Industrial Relations from Griffith University.\n\nIn a considerable upset at the 2004 election, Elliot defeated the National Party's Larry Anthony, a minister in the Howard government. Elliot's win was one of the few victories for the Labor Party as the Coalition easily won a fourth term in government. She was only the second Labor member ever to win the seat, and was also the only Labor challenger to defeat a Coalition MP in a rural seat. Richmond had been in the hands of a conservative party for all but six years since Federation, and for 66 of those years by the National Party. For much of that time, it had been a reasonably safe National seat. However, the growth of Tweed Heads and other coastal communities, as well as the concurrent loss of its more rural territory, has seen it become an increasingly urban seat since the 1980s. Elliot trailed Anthony by 11 points on the first count and was well behind him for most of the night. However, on the seventh count, a Green candidate's preferences flowed overwhelmingly to Elliot, allowing her to defeat Anthony by 301 votes.\n\nThe 2007 election saw Elliot re-elected over the Nationals' Sue Page. She picked up a swing of over 7.4 points, which was significantly larger than the New South Wales state average and technically made Richmond a safe Labor seat. Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced she would be part of his new ministry on 29 November 2007, as Minister for Ageing. She retained the seat at the 2010 election with only a small swing against Labor. She stepped aside as Minister for Ageing ahead of the formation of the Second Gillard Ministry on 11 September 2010. On 11 September 2010 Elliot was appointed as Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs and Trade, and held this position until a reconfiguration of the ministry on 4 February 2013 when she became a backbencher. She publicly announced that this was because of her opposition to coal-seam gas mining (CSG) in the electorate, which conflicted with the role of Parliamentary Secretary. Elliot retained Richmond for Labor at the 2013 election even as the Coalition opposition defeated the incumbent Labor government, marking only the second time (the first being her initial victory in 2004) that the non-Labor parties had been in government without holding Richmond. She again won with an increased majority at the 2016 election.\n\nElliot has been the Chair of the Federal Labor Country Caucus since 2014, and the Deputy Chair of the Standing Committee on Petitions since 2016.\n\n"}

Particularly in Sufism it refers to a spiritual guide. The term is frequently used in Sufi orders such as the Naqshbandiyya, Qadiriyya, Chishtiya, Shadhiliya and Suhrawardiyya.\n\nThe path of Sufism starts when a student (Murid) takes an oath of allegiance or \"Bay'ah\" (\"bai'ath\") with a spiritual guide (\"murshid\"). In speaking of this initiatory pact of allegiance, the Qur’ ̄an (48:10) says: \"Verily they who pledge unto thee their allegiance pledge it unto none but God. The Hand of God is above their hands\".\n\nThe murshid's role is to spiritually guide and verbally instruct the disciple on the Sufi path, but \"only one who has himself reached the End of the path is a spiritual guide in the full sense of the Arabic term \"murshid\"\".\n\nA murshid usually has authorisation to be a teacher for one tariqa (spiritual paths). Any tariqa or silsila has one murshid at a time who is the head of the spiritual order. He is known as the \"shaykh, by way of \"khilafah\": process in which the \"shaykh\" identifies one of his disciples as his successor, for the khalifa.\n\nIn Sufism, it is the transmission of the divine light from the murshid's heart to the disciple's which surpasses any other source of knowledge and is the only way to progress directly towards the divine. The concept of Murshid Kamil Akmal (also known as \"Insan-e-Kamil\") is significant in most tariqas. The concept states that from pre-existence till pre-eternity, there shall always remain a Qutb or a Universal Man upon the earth who would be the perfect manifestation of God and at the footsteps of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, may peace and blessings be upon him.\n\n\n"}

Before initiation, a \"murid\" is instructed by his guide, who must first accept the initiate as his or her disciple. Throughout the instruction period, the \"murīd\" typically experiences visions and dreams during personal spiritual exercises. These visions are interpreted by the \"murshid\". A common practice among the early Sufi orders, was to grant a \"khirqa\" or a robe to the \"murīd\" upon the initiation or after he had progressed through a series of increasingly difficult and significant tasks on the path of mystical development. This practice is not very common now. \"Murīds\" often receive books of instruction from \"murshids\" and often accompany itinerant \"murshids\" on their wanderings.\n\n\n"}
