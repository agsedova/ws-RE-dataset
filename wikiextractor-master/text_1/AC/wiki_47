They served as centres for propagation of the beliefs and practices of Ayyavazhi. There are more than 8000 worship centers throughout India, mostly in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The Pathis are given religious importance than the Nizhal Thangals and are considered as primary worship centers. Since Ayyavazhi is not an organised religion, Swamithoppepathi serves, religiously but not officially, as the headquarters of all.\n\nPathis were the important centres of congregational worship, being relatively bigger structures like that of a temple. They obtain their significance from the fact that Ayya Vaikundar and his activities were historically associated with these centers of worship. They are seven in number. All the Pathis except the Avatharappathi are situated in the Kanyakumari district. Since Ayyavazhi is not an organised religion the Swamithope pathi though considered as religious headquarters, it officially does not control the rest of the religious centers. And hence all the Pathis are independently managed by different formed committees or by organisations. Some Pathis are maintained by the native Ayyavazhi followers of that particular area after the period of Vaikundar.\n\nGenerally two facts are required to accredit a site as Pathi, They are\n\n\nThe Pathis are calculated as seven including Avatharappathi and Vakaippathi as Akilam call them using the term 'Pathi' and because they are related to the incarnational activities of Vaikundar. But at present, due to some conflict between the followers in accepting them as equal importance with other Pathis, only the Panchappathis are accepted by the whole mass as Pathis.

(i.e.) lesser important than Panchappathis and more important than Thangals. In any case Swamithoppe Pathi is not only the religious headquarters, but also the center which gains the highest religious importance from the incarnational activities of Vaikundar.\n\nNizhal Thangals were simple small structures built for the purpose of worship and for learning the teachings of Ayya Vaikundar. They served as centers of education during the early days. Food and shelter were offered to the needy in these centers. Some of them were established when Vaikundar was alive. Even now charity is one of the main activities conducted in these centers.\n\nThese Nizhal Thangals formed place in the socio-religious life of the people. All the people were brought together here irrespective of caste distinctions which was not usual at that period of time. The mode and formalities of worship were revolutionalised in these centers. Some 7 of the Thangals are constructed even at the time of the earthly life of Vaikundar. Religiously, these seven are considered primary among the Thangals. They are,\n\n\nAmong the secondary worship centers Thangals, these seven of them are considered primary, and are considered sacred and seen with historical importance.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April Fools' Day, 1993. In the episode, Homer plays a series of practical jokes on Bart, and to get even, Bart shakes up a can of Homer's beer with a paint shaker. Homer opens the can, resulting in a huge explosion that lands him in the hospital, where he goes into a coma. At Homer's bedside, the Simpson family reminisce, mainly about moments relevant to Homer's life.\n\nThe episode was written by Jon Vitti, and directed by Carlos Baeza. This is \"The Simpsons\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> first clip show, and it features clips from the first three seasons of the series. It was created to relieve the long hours put in by all of the show's overworked staff. The episode features cultural references to films such as \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\", \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", and \"Fantastic Voyage\". \n\nThe episode received positive reviews from critics. It was called \"as good as a clip show ever gets\" and acquired a Nielsen rating of 14.9.\n\nThe story begins on April Fools' Day as Homer is playing pranks on Bart throughout the day. Bart, angered by the numerous tricks he has fallen for, attempts to get revenge by shaking up a beer in a paint shaker. When Homer opens the beer, it results in a massive explosion that puts him in the hospital, paralyzed and placed in a wheelchair. While everyone waits for Homer to get well, the family remembers surviving similar hardships, shown in the form of clips from past episodes.\n\nAt the hospital, Homer sees a candy machine and, while trying to get chocolate, accidentally tips it on himself. The machine crushes him and puts him in a coma. After that, Mr. Burns then tries to pull the plug on Homer's life support system to keep from having to pay for Homer's health insurance. As Homer lies unconscious in the hospital bed, Bart tearfully confesses that he was the one who put him in the hospital with his shaken beer can prank. Having heard this, Homer comes out of the coma and ends up strangling Bart for his prank. Despite this, Marge and the others are happy that Homer is finally well. The episode ends with Homer, still under the assumption that it is April Fools' Day, trying to fool the family by saying he is taking them to Hawaii. However, Bart, Lisa, and Marge tell Homer that the current date is May 16, that Homer was in a coma for 7 weeks, and that he lost 5% of his brain as a result. The family laughs it off even though Homer's not sure why he is laughing.\n\nThe episode originally aired on April Fools' Day, 1993 on the Fox network. It was directed by Carlos Baeza, and written by Jon Vitti with contributions from Al Jean, Mike Reiss, Jay Kogen, Wallace Wolodarsky, John Swartzwelder, Jeff Martin, George Meyer, and Nell Scovell. The idea for the 32 \"D'oh!\"s in a row footage was from David Silverman's montage that he had assembled for his traveling college show.\n\n\"So It's Come to This: A Simpsons Clip Show\" was \"The Simpsons\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> first clip show, created to relieve the long hours put in by all of the show's overworked staff. There was intense pressure on producers of the show to create extra episodes in each season and the plan was to make four clip shows per season to meet that limit. However, writers and producers felt that this many clip shows would alienate fans of the series. The Fox network's reasoning was that clip shows cost half of what a normal episode cost to produce, but they could sell syndication rights at full price. Despite the nature of the clip show, the episode still contained an act and a half of new animation, including the extra scene from \"Bart the Daredevil\" in which Homer falls down Springfield Gorge a second time after the ambulance crashes into a tree.\n\nThe network censors initially refused to let the phrase \"beer causes rectal cancer\" into the show. The censors eventually relented when they found a medical textbook which stated the link between beer and cancer, but still asked them to \"go easy\" on beer in the future.\n\nThis flashback episode uses clips from episodes released during the first three seasons: four are from the first, five from the second, and six from the third season.\n\nGrandpa's line to Homer, \"The world was never meant for one as beautiful as you\" is from the song \"Vincent\" by Don McLean. The scene where Barney attempts to smother Homer with a pillow and breaks a hospital window with a water fountain is a parody of the final scene in Miloš Forman's 1975 film \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\". Professor Frink's suggestion of shrinking a crew of men to microscopic size and sending them into Homer in a small submarine is a reference to Richard Fleischer's 1966 film \"Fantastic Voyage\". There are also many cultural references in the clips from previous episodes. The clip of Homer picking up Marge and carrying her off in his arms into the distance is a reference to the theme of the 1982 film, \"An Officer and a Gentleman\". Bart stealing Homer's penny jar and trying to escape is an almost shot-for-shot parody of the opening sequence in the 1981 film, \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", while John Williams' \"Raiders March\" plays throughout. The scene in which Maggie hits Homer over the head with a mallet is an extensive parody of the shower scene from \"Psycho\"; the music and camera angles are almost identical.\n\nIn its original American broadcast, \"So It's Come to This: A Simpsons Clip Show\" finished fourteenth in the ratings for the week of March 28 to April 4, 1993, with a Nielsen rating of 14.9. It was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week. \n\nThe episode has received positive reviews, being labeled \"as good as a clip show ever gets\", and containing some memorable gags. It has been seen as one \"of the most consistently funny episodes of the series\", which \"strikes that perfect balance between perfectly selected classic moments and all new story segments...\" The episode's reference to \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" was named the 43rd greatest film reference in the history of the show by \"Total Film\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Nathan Ditum.\n\nIn 2015, executive producer Al Jean reacted to a hypothesis that Homer is still in a coma and all episodes since this one have been imaginary, hence a perceived surrealism and frequent guest appearances. He said that the hypothesis belongs in the \"intriguing but false file\".\n\n\n"}

A decade later, the town was officially surrendered to France by the 1659 Treaty of Pyrenees. Because of its highly strategic importance, the town's fortifications, the Château Royal de Collioure and the Fort Saint-Elme stronghold, were improved by the military engineer Vauban during the reign of Louis XIV. Nevertheless, Collioure was besieged and occupied by the Spanish troops in 1793, marking the last Spanish attempt to take the city. The blockade was broken a year later by general Jacques François Dugommier.\n\nIn 1823, the territory of Port-Vendres became a commune, taking parts from the communes of Collioure and Banyuls-sur-Mer.\n\nOn 21 January 1870, an exceptional climatic phenomenon occurred in Collioure, as observed by Charles Naudin at the time; more than of snow fell in one day on the town. Many orchards as well as cork oak woodlands were damaged.\n\n\nCollioure is the name of an Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) situated around the town, (Collioure AOC), producing red, rosé and a few white wines.\nThe ancient terraced vines in the hills behind the town also provide grapes for the apéritif and dessert wines of the (Banyuls) appellation, which shares its boundaries with the Collioure appellation.\n\nCollioure is also famous for its anchovies, and its once-thriving fisheries is referenced in Mark Kurlansky's book \"Salt\".\n\nAs the town has a strong Catalan culture, its own motto has been adopted by one of the local Catalan rugby teams (USA Perpignan, France): \"Sempre endavant, mai morirem\" (\"Always forward, We'll never die\"). Under 's leadership, the town has an alternative motto, \"Collioure sera toujours Collioure\" (\"Collioure shall always be Collioure\") quoting French singer Maurice Chevalier's famous song titled \"Paris sera toujours Paris\".\n\nThe annual Saint Vincent festival is held around August 15, attracting twice the town's population in visitors for several days of celebration with music and fireworks.\n\nIn the early 20th century Collioure became a center of artistic activity, with several Fauve artists making it their meeting place. André Derain, Georges Braque, Othon Friesz, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, James Dickson Innes and Tsuguharu Fujita have all been inspired by Collioure's royal castle, medieval streets, its lighthouse converted into the church of Notre-Dame-des-Anges and its typical Mediterranean bay. Collioure's cemetery contains the tomb of Spanish poet Antonio Machado, who fled here to escape advancing Francoist troops at the end of the Spanish Civil War in 1939.\n\nThe British novelist Patrick O'Brian lived in the town from 1949 until his death in 2000, and his novel \"The Catalans\" describes Collioure life as it was in the past. He also wrote a biography of Picasso, who was an acquaintance. O'Brian and his wife Mary are also buried in the town cemetery.\n\nPart of the action in Stephen Clarke's fourth comic novel featuring Paul West, \"Dial M for Merde\", takes place in Collioure.\n\nNinety-eight reproductions of Matisse’s and Derain’s works are exposed exactly where these two masters of Fauvism painted the originals, in the early 20th century.\n\n\n\n"}

He turned from law to literature and was the author of a number of popular dramas, volumes of poems, and essays. He was the first editor of the \"Daily Telegraph\", and\nafterwards of the \"Morning Advertiser\". He was one of the leading advocates for the volunteer movement.\n\nHe was born on 17 February 1820 at Baskerville House, Worcestershire, the eldest son of John Richards of Wassell Grove near Stourbridge, who was M.P. for Knaresborough from 1832 to 1837. He was educated at the Edinburgh high school and Westminster School, where he was admitted on 18 January 1831. He matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford, on 19 October 1837 and graduated B.A. in 1841. One of his friends at Oxford was Richard Francis Burton, and Richards later wrote a biography of the explorer.\n\nRichards entered his name as a law student at Lincoln's Inn on 16 May 1839. was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn on 20 November 1845, and for a brief time he went on circuit; but he soon began to write full-time. On 15 February 1849 he married the artist Emma Camilla Angela Maria GaggiottI. Her father, Camillo Gaggiotti was the minister of war in Rome.\n\nFrom 1848 to 1850 Richards edited a weekly newspaper, \"The British Army Despatch\". On 3 August 1850 he started a new weekly journal, \"The Mirror of the Time\", which lasted only a year. From 29 June to 31 December 1855 he was the first editor of the \"Daily Telegraph\". In 1870 Richards was appointed editor of the \"Morning Advertiser\", in succession to James Grant, and held the position until his death.\n\nTogether with authors and journalists such as Charles Dickens and William Makepeace Thackeray, Richards was a leading member of the Administrative Reform Association, founded in 1854. He was on the platform for the Association's meeting of 26 January 1856 that strongly criticised the failings of the British Government that had contributed to the fall of the Turkish fortress of Kars towards the end of the Crimean War.\n\nRichards was an advocate of enrolling of rifle corps throughout United Kingdom as a precaution against invasion; and while editor of the \"Daily Telegraph\" he publicised the subject. In 1858 he was appointed secretary of the National and Constitutional Defence Association, which was formed to give effect to the scheme. A public meeting was held, through his efforts, in St. Martin's Hall, Long Acre, on 16 April 1859; Admiral Sir Charles Napier presided, and, as a result, the War Office issued, on 12 May 1859, a circular which authorised the enrolling of rifle volunteers.\n\nRichards then hired rooms in the City of London, and enlisted 1000 men to form the 'Workmen's Volunteer Brigade'. Although the unit began holding parades at the City of London's Guildhall in the autumn of 1860, the first officers' commissions were not issued until 26 April 1861, when the unit was formally adopted as the 3rd City of London Rifle Volunteer Corps. The men were generally less well-off than some other London corps recruited from the professions and middle classes, but the unit received some financial support from the City of London and the Livery Companies. It adopted the motto \"LABOR OMNIA VINCIT\" (Work conquers everything) derived from Virgil.\n\nRichards invited Maj-Gen William Ferguson Beatson of the Bengal Army to be the 3rd London RVC's honorary colonel. Beatson was a friend of Richard Francis Burton and was in London in connection with a court case. He had previously been supported by Richards and the Radicals in a series of high-profile disagreements with the War Office. Beatson took the salute at a parade in the Guildhall on 22 September 1860, but was under orders to return to India and was unable to accept the role permanently.\n\nThe 3rd London RVC needed a wealthy patron, and Richards next persuaded Sir William de Bathe, Bt to become the Lieutenant-Colonel commandant, with Richards his second-in-command, ranked as a Major. In 1861 Bathe and Richards became Honorary Colonel and Lt-Col Commandant respectively. Richards retired from the position in 1867, but the unit continued without him, becoming the 7th (City of London) Battalion London Regiment in 1908. The Standards and Colours of these units are still on display at Grove Park Army Reserve Centre and can be viewed by appointment.\n\nAt the same time that he was raising the 3rd London RVC, Richards was also a member of the Garibaldi Special Fund, along with the journalist George Holyoake. The Committee raised money to send a force of volunteers, the 'British Legion', to assist Giuseppe Garibaldi in his campaign to liberate the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies from its Bourbon overlords. Many of the 'Garibaldi Excursionists', as the Legion was nicknamed, were members of the new Rifle Volunteer Corps.\n\nRichards died on 12 June 1876, in his fifty-seventh year, at 22 Brunswick Square, London, and was buried in St. Peter's churchyard, Croydon. The rifle-volunteer movement grew rapidly, as the Volunteer Force, and by the end of the century had enrolled well over 200,000.\n\nOn 18 November 1841 Richards brought out an anonymous pamphlet \"Oxford Unmasked\", in which he denounced abuses in the organisation of the university. It passed through five editions; and its authorship became known. His first dramatic work, published in 1845, was a five-act tragedy \"Crœsus, King of Lydia\". Four other five-act dramas followed: \"Runnymede\" in 1846, \"Cromwell\" in 1847, \"Isolda, or Good King Stephen\" in 1848, and \"Vandyck, a Play of Genoa\", in 1850. In 1846 there appeared his first volume of poems, \"Death and the Magdalen\", and in 1848 another, entitled \"The Dream of the Soul\".\n\nA nationalist and militarist, opposed to the Manchester school of politicians, Richards issued in 1848, in the form of a letter addressed to Richard Cobden, a denunciation of the \"peace-at-any-price party\", under the title of \"Cobden and his Pamphlet considered\". Another volume was \"Britain Redeemed and Canada Preserved\", anticipating a railway between the Atlantic and the Pacific. \"Poems, Essays, and Opinions\" (2 vols.), and \"Essays and Opinions\" (2 vols.) consisted of writings from \"The Mirror of the Time\". He brought out, in 1854, a collection of lyrics called \"The Minstrelsy of War\".\n\nIn 1869 Richards published \"Medea\", a poetic rhapsody on the picture by Frederick Sandys. In 1871 his only novel \"So very Human\" was published, with a title suggested by a phrase from Charles Dickens. Besides the five dramas above, Richards produced four others. One of these, his tragedy of \"Norma\", based on the libretto of Vincenzo Bellini's opera, was performed for the first time on 5 February 1875 at Belfast, with Miss Wallis in the title rôle. His other dramatic works, which were not published, were \"The Prisoner of Toulon\", \"King Pym, or the Great Rebellion\", and \"Love and Patience\".\n\n\n"}

Throughout this stretch, OR 213 runs parallel to Interstate 205 and thus mainly serves local traffic. However, traffic can still be heavy due to incidents on I-205 as well as the street's many businesses. Also, the street has some of the highest bus ridership in the region, along Tri-Met Route 72, which connects with the MAX Blue Line at the 82nd Avenue MAX Station.\n\nOR 213 then follows I-205 for approximately , before departing the freeway in Oregon City. It then proceeds south on a four-lane expressway through a scenic canyon on Oregon City's eastern edge until it intersects with Molalla Avenue in the vicinity of Clackamas Community College. This route goes by a number of names, known alternately as 82nd Drive, the Oregon City Bypass or the Trails End Highway. It then continues south as a two-lane, undivided route, through the communities of Carus, Mulino, and Liberal. In Liberal, Oregon Route 213 becomes the \"Cascade Highway\" (formerly Route 215) and continues south.

He directed 40 films between 1946 and 1988. Borowczyk settled in Paris in 1959. As a film director he worked mainly in France.\n\nBorn in Kwilcz near Poznań, Borowczyk studied painting at the Academy of Fine Arts in Kraków, then devoted himself to painting and lithography, including the creation of posters for the cinema, which earned him a national prize in 1953. His early films were surreal animations, some only a few seconds long, including several comic abecedaria. His most acclaimed early films were \"Był sobie raz\" (Time Upon a Once) (1957) and \"Dom\" (House) (1958, with Jan Lenica). \nIn 1959, Borowczyk immigrated to France and settled in Paris. He worked with Chris Marker for \"Les Astronautes\". Major works of this period include the stop motion film \"Renaissance\" (1963), which uses reverse motion to depict various destroyed objects (a prayer book, a stuffed toy, etc.) re-assembling themselves, only to be destroyed again when the last object (a bomb) is complete, and the nightmarish \"Jeux des anges\" (1964), selected by Terry Gilliam as one of the ten best animated films of all time. In 1967, he directed his first animated feature film, \"Théâtre de Monsieur & Madame Kabal: un film dessiné pour les adultes\" (Mr. and Mrs. Kabal's Theatre).\n\nBorowczyk moved into live-action feature film with \"Goto, l'île d'amour\" (Goto, Isle of Love) (1968) and \"Blanche\" (1971), both tales of illicit love thwarted by jealous husbands, and both starring his own wife, Ligia Branice. One of his most appreciated films of this period, \"Dzieje grzechu\" (A Story of Sin) (1975), which was nominated for Palme d'or, is an adaptation of a Polish literary classic by Stefan Żeromski. Like his 1966 short film \"Rosalie\" (a Guy de Maupassant adaptation and a Silver Bear winner), \"Dzieje grzechu\" had successfully rendered the themes of seduction and infanticide. \"Contes immoraux\" (Immoral Tales) (1973) and his later work, including \"Interno di un convento\" (Behind Convent Walls) (1977) (inspired by \"Promenades dans Rome\" of Stendhal) and \"Cérémonie d'amour\" (Rites of Love) (1988) have been controversial, lauded by some for their unique surrealist vision and derided by others as contentless pornography. Especially, \"La Bête\" (The Beast, 1975) (based on the novel \"Lokis\" by Prosper Mérimée and originally conceived in 1972 as a film on its own, but then in 1973 as the fifth story in \"Contes immoraux\") was seen by many as a decline in the director's career after \"Dzieje grzechu\", except in France, where it was hailed by prominent critics such as Ado Kyrou. His 1980 film \"Lulu\" was based on the eponymous character created by Frank Wedekind.\n\nIn 1981, he made \"Docteur Jekyll et les femmes\" (Blood of Dr Jekyll), a version of the Jekyll and Hyde story starring Udo Kier and Patrick Magee and depicting Jekyll's transformation as a violent rebellion against the Victorian morality. In his 1988 book \"Nightmare Movies\", Kim Newman described the film as \"dark, misanthropic and interestingly offensive\". He made a brief return to animation with his 1984 short film \"Scherzo infernal\". In 1987, he directed \"Emmanuelle 5\", an installment of the Emmanuelle series, that was also released in a hardcore video-only version. He was unhappy with the project due to a dispute concerning the casting of lead actress Monique Gabrielle. In 1988 and 1990, he directed four episodes for the series \"Série rose: Les Chefs d’œuvre de la littérature érotique\" on M6.\n\nMany of Borowczyk's films use historical settings, including \"Ars Amandi: l'arte di amare\" (The Art of Love) (1983), set in the time of Ovid (and featuring the poet as a character); \"Blanche\", set during the Middle Ages; and three of the four episodes in \"Contes immoraux\", set respectively in the nineteenth century, the sixteenth century, and the Borgia papacy.\n\nA number of his films (such as the \"tale\" \"La Marée\" (The Tide) in \"Contes immoraux\", the 1976 \"La Marge\" (The Streetwalker), the episode \"Marceline\" in \"Les Héroïnes du mal: Margherita, Marceline, Marie\" (Immoral Women) (1979), and \"Cérémonie d'amour\") were based on stories by André Pieyre de Mandiargues. A less usual product of this cooperation was \"Une collection particulière\" of 1973, a representation of Borowczyk's collection of pornographic items, with Mandiargues having written (and read) the narration.\n\nBorowczyk was the author of two books; \"Anatomia diabła\" (Anatomy of Devil) (1992) and \"Moje polskie lata\" (My Polish Years) (2002).\n\nHe died of heart failure in Paris in 2006, aged 82.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The term \"AFNI\" refers both to the entire suite and to a particular interactive program often used for visualization. AFNI is actively developed by the NIMH Scientific and Statistical Computing Core and its capabilities are continually expanding.\n\nAFNI runs under many Unix-like operating systems that provide X11 and Motif libraries, including IRIX, Solaris, Linux, FreeBSD and OS X. Precompiled binaries are available for some platforms. AFNI is available for research use under the GNU General Public License. AFNI now comprises over 300,000 lines of C source code, and a skilled C programmer can add interactive and batch functions to AFNI with relative ease.\n\nAFNI was originally developed at the Medical College of Wisconsin beginning in 1994, largely by Robert W. Cox. Cox brought development to the NIH in 2001 and development continues at the NIMH Scientific and Statistical Computing Core. In a 1995 paper describing the rationale for development of the software, Cox wrote of fMRI data: \"The volume of data gathered is very large, and it is essential that easy-to-use tools for visualization and analysis of 3D activation maps be available for neuroscience investigators.\" Since then, AFNI has become one of the more commonly used analysis tools in fMRI research, alongside SPM and FSL.\n\nAlthough AFNI initially required extensive shell scripting to execute tasks, pre-made batch scripts and improvements to the graphical user interface (GUI) have since made it possible to generate analyses with less user scripting.\n\nOne of AFNI's initial offerings improved the approach to transforming scans of individual brains onto a shared standardized space. Since each person's individual brain is unique in size and shape, comparing across a number of brains requires warping (rotating, scaling, etc.) individual brains into a standard shape. Unfortunately, functional MRI data at the time of AFNI's development was too low resolution for effective transformations. Instead, researchers use the higher resolution anatomical brain scans, often acquired at the beginning of an imaging session.\n\nAFNI allows researchers to overlay a functional image to the anatomical, providing tools for aligning the two into the same space. Processes engaged to warp an individual anatomical scan to standard space are then applied also to the functional scan, improving the transformation process.\n\nAnother feature available in AFNI is the SUMA tool, developed by Ziad Saad. This tool allows users to project the 2D data onto a 3D cortical surface map. In this way researchers can view activation patterns while more easily taking into account physical cortical features like gyri.\n\n\"afni_proc.py\" is a pre-made script that will run fMRI data from a single subject through a series of pre-processing steps, starting with the raw data. The default settings will perform the following pre-processing steps and finish with a basic regression analysis:\n\n\n\n"}

The 6th-century St Benedict directed that his monks begin their daily assemblies with such readings and over time expressions such as \"coming together for the chapter\" (\") found their meaning transferred from the text to the meeting itself and then to the body gathering for it.

The MONIAC was an analogue computer which used fluidic logic to model the workings of an economy. The MONIAC name may have been suggested by an association of money and ENIAC, an early electronic digital computer.\n\nThe MONIAC was approximately 2 m high, 1.2 m wide and almost 1 m deep, and consisted of a series of transparent plastic tanks and pipes which were fastened to a wooden board. Each tank represented some aspect of the UK national economy and the flow of money around the economy was illustrated by coloured water. At the top of the board was a large tank called the treasury. Water (representing money) flowed from the treasury to other tanks representing the various ways in which a country could spend its money. For example, there were tanks for health and education. To increase spending on health care a tap could be opened to drain water from the treasury to the tank which represented health spending. Water then ran further down the model to other tanks, representing other interactions in the economy. Water could be pumped back to the treasury from some of the tanks to represent taxation. Changes in tax rates were modeled by increasing or decreasing pumping speeds.\n\nSavings reduce the funds available to consumers and investment income increases those funds. The MONIAC showed it by draining water (savings) from the expenditure stream and by injecting water (investment income) into that stream. When the savings flow exceeds the investment flow, the level of water in the savings and investment tank (the surplus-balances tank) would rise to reflect the accumulated balance. When the investment flow exceeds the savings flow for any length of time, the surplus-balances tank would run dry. Import and export were represented by water draining from the model and by additional water being poured into the model.\n\nThe actual flow of the water was automatically controlled through a series of floats, counterweights, electrodes, and cords. When the level of water reached a certain level in a tank, pumps and drains would be activated. To their surprise, Phillips and his associate Walter Newlyn found that MONIAC could be calibrated to an accuracy of 2%.\n\nThe flow of water between the tanks was determined by economic principles and the settings for various parameters. Different economic parameters, such as tax rates and investment rates, could be entered by setting the valves which controlled the flow of water about the computer. Users could experiment with different settings and note the effect on the model. The MONIAC’s ability to model the subtle interaction of a number of variables made it a powerful tool for its time.\nWhen a set of parameters resulted in a viable economy the model would stabilise and the results could be read from scales. The output from the computer could also be sent to a rudimentary plotter.\n\nMONIAC had been designed to be used as a teaching aid but was discovered also to be an effective economic simulator. At the time that MONIAC was created, electronic digital computers that could run complex economic simulations were unavailable. In 1949, the few computers in existence were restricted to government and military use. Neither did they have adequate visual display facilities, so were unable to illustrate the operation of complex models. Observing the MONIAC in operation made it much easier for students to understand the interrelated processes of a national economy. The range of organisations that acquired a MONIAC showed that it was used in both capacities.\n\nPhillips scrounged a variety of materials to create his prototype computer, including bits and pieces from war surplus such as parts from old Lancaster bombers. The first MONIAC was created in his landlady’s garage in Croydon at a cost of £400 ().\n\nPhillips first demonstrated the MONIAC to a number of leading economists at the LSE in 1949. It was very well received and Phillips was soon offered a teaching position at the LSE.\n\nIt is thought that twelve to fourteen machines were built. \n\n\n\n\n"}

Where substances are protected by letters patent, their inclusion in the pharmacopoeia neither conveys, nor implies, licence to manufacture.\n\nThe regulation of medicinal products by officials in the United Kingdom dates back to the reign of King Henry VIII (1491–1547). The Royal College of Physicians of London had the power to inspect apothecaries’ products in the London area, and to destroy defective stock. The first list of approved drugs, with information on how they should be prepared, was the \"London Pharmacopoeia\", published in 1618. The first edition of what is now known as the \"British Pharmacopoeia\" was published in 1864, and was one of the first attempts to harmonise pharmaceutical standards, through the merger of the \"London\", \"Edinburgh\" and \"Dublin Pharmacopoeias\". The New Latin name that had some currency at the time was \"Pharmacopoeia Britannica\" (Ph. Br.).\n\nA commission was first appointed by the General Medical Council (GMC), when the body was made statutorily responsible under the Medical Act 1858 for producing a British pharmacopoeia on a national basis. In 1907, the \"British Pharmacopoeia\" was supplemented by the \"British Pharmaceutical Codex\", which gave information on drugs and other pharmaceutical substances not included in the \"BP\", and provided standards for these.\n\nThe Medicines Act 1968 established the legal status of the British Pharmacopoeia Commission, and of the \"British Pharmacopoeia\", as the UK standard for medicinal products under section 4 of the Act. The British Pharmacopoeia Commission continues the work of the earlier Commissions appointed by the GMC, and is responsible for preparing new editions of the \"British Pharmacopoeia\" and the \"British Pharmacopoeia (Veterinary)\", and for keeping them up to date. Under Section 100 of the Medicines Act, the British Pharmacopoeia Commission is also responsible for selecting and devising British Approved Names (BANs )(see #British Approved Names).\n\nSince its first publication back in 1864, the distribution of the \"British Pharmacopoeia\" has grown throughout the world. It is now used in over 100 countries. Australia and Canada are two of the countries that have adopted the \"BP\" as their national standard alongside the UK; in other countries, e.g. South Korea, the \"BP\" is recognised as an acceptable reference standard.\n\nThe current edition of the \"British Pharmacopoeia\" comprises six volumes, which contain nearly 3,000 monographs for drug substances, excipients, and formulated preparation, together with supporting general notices, appendices (test methods, reagents etc.), and reference spectra, used in the practice of medicine, all comprehensively indexed and cross-referenced for easy reference. Items used exclusively in veterinary medicine in the UK are included in the \"BP (Veterinary)\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \"British Pharmacopoeia\" is available as a printed volume and electronically in both on-line and CD-ROM versions; the electronic products use sophisticated search techniques to locate information quickly. For example, pharmacists referring to a monograph can immediately link to other related substances and appendices referenced in the content by using 130,000+ hypertext links within the text.\n\nThe \"British Pharmacopoeia\" is prepared by the Pharmacopoeial Secretariat, working in collaboration with the British Pharmacopoeia Laboratory, the British Pharmacopoeia Commission (BPC), and its Expert Advisory Groups (EAG) and Advisory Panels. The development of pharmacopoeial standards receives input from relevant industries, hospitals, academia, professional bodies and governmental sources, both within and outside the UK.\n\nThe British Pharmacopoeia Laboratory provides analytical and technical support to the \"British Pharmacopoeia\". Its major functions are:\n\nThe current edition of the \"British Pharmacopoeia\" is available from The Stationery Office Bookshop.\n\nDetailed information and guidance on various aspects of current pharmacopoeial policy and practice is provided in supplementary chapters of the \"British Pharmacopoeia\". This includes explanation of the basis of pharmacopoeial specifications, and information on the development of monographs including guidance to manufacturers.\n\nBritish Approved Names (BANs) are devised or selected by the British Pharmacopoeia Commission (BPC), and published by the Health Ministers, on the recommendation of the Commission on Human Medicines, to provide a list of names of substances or articles referred to in Section 100 of the Medicines Act 1968. BANs are short, distinctive names, for substances; where the systematic chemical or other scientific names are too complex for convenient general use.\n\nAs a consequence of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, the British Approved Names, since 2002, may be assumed to be the recommended International Non-proprietary Name (rINN), except where otherwise stated. A World Health Organization (WHO) INN identifies a pharmaceutical substance or active pharmaceutical ingredient by a unique name that is globally recognised, and in which no party can claim any proprietary rights. A non-proprietary name is also known as a generic name.\n\nThere are equivalent pharmacopoeia in many other countries, such as U.S. (the \"United States Pharmacopoeia\"), Japan (\"Japanese Pharmacopoeia\"), and China (\"Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China\"), and the World Health Organization maintains \"The International Pharmacopoeia\".\n\nThe \"British National Formulary\" (BNF) and its related publications contains information on prescribing, indications, side effects and costs of all medication drugs available on the National Health Service (NHS).\n\n\n"}

He went to school in his native city. It was while he was at the Lycée that he met his lifelong friend Raoul Dufy. He and Dufy studied at the Le Havre School of Fine Arts in 1895-96 and then went to Paris together for further study. In Paris, Friesz met Henri Matisse, Albert Marquet, and Georges Rouault. Like them, he rebelled against the academic teaching of Bonnat and became a member of the Fauves, exhibiting with them in 1907. The following year, Friesz returned to Normandy and to a much more traditional style of painting, since he had discovered that his personal goals in painting were firmly rooted in the past. He opened his own studio in 1912 and taught until 1914 at which time he joined the army for the duration of the war. He resumed living in Paris in 1919 and remained there, except for brief trips to Toulon and the Jura Mountains, until his death in 1949.\n\nDuring the last thirty years of his life, he painted in a style completely removed from that of his earlier colleagues and his contemporaries. Having abandoned the lively arabesques and brilliant colors of his Fauve years, Friesz returned to the more sober palette he had learned in Le Havre from his professor Charles Lhuillier and to an early admiration for Poussin, Chardin, and Corot. He painted in a manner that respected Cézanne's ideas of logical composition, simple tonality, solidity of volume, and distinct separation of planes. A faint baroque flavor adds vigor to his (most well-known) landscapes, still lifes, and figure paintings.\n\nOthon Friesz died in Paris. He is buried in the Cimetière du Montparnasse in Paris. His pupils included the painter Marthe Rakine.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2110145", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2110145", "title": "T-Type", "text": "T-Type\n\nThe T-Type is a series of Buick automobiles that were popular during the 1980s. This marketing approach for Buick products was a revival of a similar approach used in the 1960s (and later revived in the 1990s) with the Buick GS designation.\nThes T-Type cars were built as performance-oriented models, the most famous of which was the Buick GNX (based on the Regal platform). During the time that the T-Type cars were in production, turbochargers were becoming very popular in the aftermarket performance industry, and in Detroit, they were adopted for use on production vehicles, the most notable of which was the Regal.\n\nThe first model to receive the T-Type badge was the 1981 Buick Riviera. Within a few years, other models from the Buick lineup would follow suit. The Grand National (also referred to as \"GN\"), an adaptation of the Regal T-Type and introduced in 1982, became an instant success; it inspired the company to extend its T-Type line to its other mid-size offering, the Century (though without the turbocharged engine). The compact Skyhawk and Skylark also received the T-Type treatment in 1983, and in 1986 the Somerset did as well.\n\nThe T-Type series reached its peak in 1987. By that time, even the full-size LeSabre and Electra were available as T-Type models, but without the turbocharger. The Lesabre T-Type coupe design was a different approach, pieced together from design highlights of the rare 1986 Lesabre Grand National (116 built), and although odd-looking, was a more cohesive touring car package. Also that year, the GNX made automotive history as \"the fastest American car in 1987\" (a distinction it held through 1989, which was the Regal's second year as a front-wheel drive car). The GNX recorded a 0-60 time of 4.7 seconds, and its \"fast car\" reputation led many people to dub it \"Corvette killer.\" In addition, its turbocharged V6 made it an attractive alternative to its similar-bodied V8-powered siblings, such as the Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS and Oldsmobile 442 (neither of which had the turbocharger available to them).\n\nThe T-Type line met its demise in 1990, as an option on the Buick Electra, and the following year, a new, upsized Park Avenue Ultra was introduced with a supercharged engine. The Riviera and Regal also had supercharged engines as an option when they were redesigned in 1995 and 1997, respectively; the current Regal also has a turbocharger as an option, starting with its return to the lineup in 2011, as do the 2012 Buick Verano and 2014 Buick Encore.\n\nThe turbocharged engines were usually General Motors' famous 3.8 L V6 engine, but in the case of the Skyhawk, a turbocharged four-cylinder was available (1.8 sourced from Brazil in the Skyhawk, 2.5 in the Skylark/Somerset). Transmission choices were a five-speed manual (Skyhawk only) and, depending on the year and model, a three- or four-speed automatic. The interiors of T-Type cars differed from most other Buicks in that the front seats were almost always bucket seats, and the shifter was mounted in the center console, except the 1981-85 Rivieras which had the buckets and a consolette but a column shifter. Some T-Type Electras and Centurys kept the front bench seats and column shifter intact and even in bucket seat models, the T-Type Electra and Century still had a column-mounted shifter. By comparison, the turbocharged editions of the 2011 Regal and 2012 Verano use a 2.0 L four-cylinder engine that can be mated to either a manual or automatic transmission (both six-speeds), and the Encore uses a 1.4 L four-cylinder engine that is mated to a six-speed automatic only.\n\nThe T-Type logo consisted of a large red letter \"T\", and the word \"Type\" in small black or white letters. The emblems were only placed on the fenders and on some later models (1986) a grille emblem was used. The single T was only used on the turbo Regals and only in 1987. Originally the T-type name was to be an appearance package and used across the line (which it did) but was confused by the turbo Regal when the 3.8 turbo motor could be ordered with the T-type package. In 1987 Buick dropped the T-Type package on the Regal. All turbo Regals in 1987 came with the Y56 T package and have a T badge on the fenders and on the horn button (a similar T badge also appears on the current Regal Turbo and Verano Turbo). This T package is often erroneously thought to designate the Turbo T package, which is solely the WE4 Regal.\n\nAs a drag racer, the GN's main opponent is the Ford Mustang, a prime example of GM's long-standing rivalry with Ford . In addition, the GNX is featured in the popular racing game Gran Turismo 4. In 1984, the GN's legend grew when it defeated a Corvette in a quarter-mile run featuring GM vehicles, thus creating a rare instance of \"the fastest American car\" that was not made by Chevrolet (despite the fact that it had two less cylinders than the normally-aspirated sports car).\n\nIt has been rumored that the T-Type, Grand National and GNX nameplates could return to the Buick lineup, to be sold as 4-door sedans. These new incarnations would share a rear-wheel drive platform with the Cadillac ATS and be powered by a choice of two engines that would be mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission or 6-speed manual. The T-Type and Grand National would use a turbocharged 2.0L 4-cylinder (272 HP) or a naturally aspirated 3.6L V6 (321 HP) while the GNX would most likely get a 3.6L Twin-Turbo V6 (400 HP). This would be the first use of rear-wheel drive since the Buick Roadmaster was discontinued in 1996.\n\n2. http://www.caranddriver.com/features/2015-buick-grand-national-and-gnx-25-cars-worth-waiting-for-20142017-future-cars\n"}

Its northern terminus is at U.S. Route 69/136 in Bethany. Its southern terminus is at the Arkansas state line in downtown Blue Eye, Missouri–Arkansas where it continues as Highway 21. It is one of the original state highways of Missouri.\n\nThe road serves as an important corridor between Springfield and Kansas City, two of the three largest cities in the state. Heading north from Springfield, Route 13 intersects Route 7 at Clinton which in turn carries traffic to Interstate 49/U.S. Route 71 at Harrisonville. I-49/US 71 then continues on into downtown Kansas City. Route 13, Route 7, and I-49/US 71 now provide a four-lane highway (much of it freeway) between Springfield and Kansas City since the completion of the final widening project between Collins and Clinton.\n\nSeveral sections from north of Reeds Spring through Branson West have been widened, rebuilt, moved, and renamed to help ease traffic congestion through the towns. Drivers regularly use these routes to get to many of the lakes in southern Missouri and this has caused a major headache in recent years. One section of road has been renamed Route 413 and travels north to Springfield. In June 2009, the nation's first diverging diamond interchange, a style of interchange where traffic crosses to the left-side of the road, opened to traffic. The interchange is located at the I-44/MO-13 junction in Springfield.\n\nIn 2006 the portion through Caldwell County, Missouri was named the \"Zack Wheat Memorial Highway\" in honor of the Baseball Hall of Fame player.\n\nRoute 13 begins at the Arkansas state line in Blue Eye. After leaving the town, it runs through the rugged countryside of the southwest Missouri Ozarks, part of the Mark Twain National Forest. Route 13 forms a concurrency with Route 86 before bridging Table Rock Lake south of the town of Branson West. In Branson West, it leaves the national forest and forms a concurrency with Route 76 and Route 265. North of this, Route 13 runs concurrent with Route 248 for . At Reeds Spring Junction is the southern terminus of Route 413, and old alignment of Route 13, changed in the early 2000s (decade). Also at Reeds Spring Junction, U.S. Route 160 joins to form another concurrency with Route 13. At Spokane, the two routes are joined by a third route, Route 176.\n\nRoute 13 and US 160 intersect Route 14 in Nixa. The two roads continue north into Greene County, where they enter Springfield running along Campbell Avenue. At the James River Freeway, Route 13 and US 160 turn off Campbell to run along the freeway with U.S. Route 60. Route 13 splits off the freeway at the next exit to turn north along Kansas Expressway. At Sunshine Street is the northern terminus of Route 413. On the north side of Springfield, Route 13 crosses Route 744 (Kearney Street) and Interstate 44 less than a mile north. It then passes near the Ozark Empire Fairgrounds and the Dickerson Park Zoo and leaves the city as a divided highway. A project begun in 2009 and completed on June 21 of that year, turned the existing Route 13 and I-44 interchange into a diverging diamond, which was the first of its kind in the nation. In addition to costing $2.5 million compared to around $8 million for a complete rebuild, this has also helped ease congestion at the interchange by making lefts onto the on-ramps \"free lefts\" by lanes shifting into opposite lanes when passing over the bridge.\n\nSouth of Bolivar, the divided highway splits apart, with the northbound lanes being the older highway, though an even older alignment runs further to the east. Because of the situation, numerous \"Do not enter\" signs are posted to help prevent local traffic from driving on the wrong lanes of the highway. Near Brighton is a short concurrency with Route 215. Construction began in summer of 2008 to build new northbound lanes next to the straighter southbound lanes. This project was completed in 2010 and the old northbound lanes will be designated county roads when the project is completed.\n\nAt Bolivar, in addition to the intersection with Route 32, is another business route. The business route ends, along with Route 83 at an interchange on the southern part of the town. South of Humansville is the intersection with Route 123. At Collins is an interchange with U.S. Route 54. At Osceola, Route 13 crosses a branch of the Harry S. Truman Reservoir.\n\nAt Deepwater, Route 13 forms a concurrency with Route 52. The two routes cross Harry S. Truman Reservoir twice before heading into Clinton. Routes 13 and 52 serve as the eastern terminus of Route 18. Route 7 joins the concurrency at the same intersection as Route 18's terminus, and the three routes continue around the northeastern part of the town, where Route 52 splits off, and eventually Routes 7 and 13 go their separate ways.\n\nNorth of Post Oak, the highway has an intersection with Route 2. East of Warrensburg is an intersection with U.S. Route 50. South of Higginsville, Route 13 crosses Interstate 70/U.S. Route 40. At Higginsville is the western terminus of Route 20.\n\nRoute 13 is concurrent with U.S. Route 24 for approximately two miles immediately south of Lexington, site of a Civil War battlefield and the route's northernmost business route. It leaves U.S. Route 24 east of Lexington where it intersects Route 224 and then crosses the Missouri River. From U.S. Route 24 in Lexington to the intersection with Route 10 in Richmond, the road is a four-lane limited access highway. North of Richmond, it returns to a two-lane highway flanked by a lot of crop land. At Polo the road forms a short concurrency with Route 116, and further north, at Hamilton is an intersection with U.S. Route 36. Near Gallatin, it turns east forming a concurrency with Route 6 for , then turns north again. A few miles north is a junction with Interstate 35. Then, Route 13 ends at US 69/Route 136 in Bethany.\n\nThe original southern terminus of the highway (as laid out in 1922) was at Route 71 (now U.S. Route 65) in Buffalo. With the creation of the U.S. Highway system in 1926, it was realigned to absorb the Bolivar-Springfield Route 69, which had been created in 1922; the former piece from Bolivar to Buffalo became an extension of Route 66, which quickly became part of US 54 (and is now part of Route 32). Route 13 took over Route 43, established in 1922 from Marionville south to the Arkansas state line, in about 1930.\n\nRoute 123 is the old alignment of Route 13 between Humansville and Fair Play, where Route 13 turned east on to what is now Route 32 (Route 64 prior to 1956) back to Bolivar.\n\n"}

The station is owned by Brigham Young University (BYU), which is owned and operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). KBYU-TV's studios are located on the BYU campus in Provo, and its transmitter is located on Farnsworth Peak in the Oquirrh Mountains, southwest of Salt Lake City.\n\nThe station has a large network of broadcast translators that extend its over-the-air coverage throughout Utah, as well as portions of Idaho and Colorado.\n\nThe channel 11 allocation in Provo was first intended to be built as a commercial station. In October 1955, the Beehive Telecasting Corporation, owned by Samuel B. Nissley, filed to build channel 11, with studios in Orem and a transmitter on Lake Mountain. The permit was granted in December 1957. Two months later, ground was broken on studio facilities for the station. KLOR went on the air as Utah's first independent television station on December 17, 1958.\n\nChannel 11's commercial existence was short-lived. The independent station struggled against larger outlets in Salt Lake City. In December 1959, Nissley sued General Electric, which provided and installed the transmitter, for more than $1 million, claiming a negligent transmitter installation that impaired KLOR's signal in the Salt Lake Valley; by this time, KLOR was also facing lawsuits from potential creditors, including program suppliers. KLOR went silent March 12, 1960, when a power surge blew out a transformer. Beehive went into bankruptcy on July 1, 1960.\n\nIn March 1962, BYU filed an application to buy KLOR's license, but not its Orem studio facilities. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the sale on September 25, 1962, with the stipulation that channel 11 become non-commercial; the KBYU-TV callsign was instituted on October 15. In 1964, BYU filed to relocate the studio to the Fine Arts Center on the campus and the transmitter to Mount Vision in the Oquirrh Mountains. The KLOR-TV studios were sold to two local businessmen and became other offices before being demolished.\n\nThe station returned to the air with regular programs on November 15, 1965, though the station was already on the air during the daytime for broadcasts to schools in association with the Utah State Department of Public Instruction. This made Salt Lake City one of the smallest markets with two PBS member stations; its main competition was the University of Utah's KUED (channel 7). In 2010, KBYU-TV rebranded as \"Eleven.\"\n\nOn July 2, 2018, the station ended its membership with PBS and began simulcasting BYU's co-owned specialty channel BYUtv on its primary subchannel. This leaves KUED as the sole PBS station for the Salt Lake City market and the state of Utah.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nKBYU-TV also utilizes the alternate audio tracks that can be activated through the second audio program function, both carried on the third alternate audio track: the station's main channel features an audio simulcast of KBYU-FM (89.1). Digital subchannel 11.2 featured an alternate audio feed of BYU Radio (which is commonly found streamed over the Internet), but was taken off-the-air on June 30, 2018 when BYU TV International ceased operations.\n\nIn 1997, KBYU-TV was allotted UHF channel 39 for its digital signal, but in 1999, the station changed its digital allotment to UHF channel 44 as part of a digital channel realignment coordinated by DTV Utah, a consortium of eight Salt Lake City market television stations, of which KBYU is a member. KBYU-DT began broadcasting its digital signal on November 15, 2000 and it was licensed on January 23, 2003.\n\nKBYU-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 11, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 44, using PSIP to display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 11.\n\nSince KBYU's current physical TV channel is in the 600 MHz band being sold off in the FCC's incentive auction, with channels 38 to 51 being eliminated, the station filed for a construction permit in September 2017 to move to physical channel 17 at the same location, power and height.\n\nPrior to July 2, 2018, programming on KBYU-TV consisted of general PBS fare, with emphasis on children's, informational and entertainment programming. The station also airs special programs related to the LDS Church, and offered a nightly block of classic television programs, such as \"I Love Lucy\", \"Perry Mason\", \"My Three Sons\", \"The Andy Griffith Show\" and \"Little House on the Prairie\" (as such, it was one of the only, if not the only, public television stations in the United States that broadcasts programming normally acquired for U.S. commercial syndication, something made possible by the station's roots as commercial station KLOR and its resulting commercial license).\n\nThe only exception that KBYU-TV currently airs from the straight simulcast of BYU TV is the weekday student-produced half-hour newscast, \"Eleven News at Noon.\" As an educational station it does not carry advertising, and BYU TV itself does not carry advertising, instead carrying promotional spots for the network's programming during breaks (the national feed also carries KBYU-TV's hourly legal station identification).\n\nKBYU-TV has produced some notable programs for national distribution. \"Ancestors\", produced in conjunction with the LDS Church's Family History Library and PBS, was a highly successful series of videos on family genealogy. It was so well received that KBYU-TV produced a second series of videos, also entitled \"Ancestors\", which proved to be even more successful . \"Small Fortunes: Microcredit and the Future of Poverty\", produced in 2005, explored the business of Microcredit through eleven providers of the service. Another show produced by KBYU was \"Hooked on Aerobics\", which was on the air for many years.\n\nKBYU-TV uses an extensive network of translator stations to extend its signal throughout Utah, plus parts of Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, and Nevada:\n\nBYU Broadcasting also operates classical music radio station KBYU-FM (89.1), BYU Radio, and other internet-exclusive radio services.\n\n\n \n"}

He also helps his wife, Kadette, rescue and retrain retired thoroughbred racehorses find a new career.\n\nFossum was born in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. He attended Midway High School in Waco, Texas where he was a two time Central Texas Player of the Year, 1st team all state in '95 and '96, Baseball America High School second team All American in '96 with 210 strikeouts in 105 innings. Casey then attended Texas A&M University where he was also a Freshman All American and still holds the all-time career strikeout record in a single season and career. He also helped lead the Aggies to the 1999 College World Series in Omaha, Nebraska. He earned All-Big 12 honors in both 1998 and 1999, highlighted by a 12–7 record and 3.64 earned run average (ERA) during his junior campaign, establishing a single-season school mark with 162 strikeouts. Fossum also won the C. E. \"Pat\" Olsen Outstanding Pitcher Award in 1999 and was a second team All-American in 1998.\n\nFossum was selected by the Boston Red Sox in the 1999 June draft as the 18th pick in the first supplemental round (48th overall), and started his major league career in 2001.\n\nDuring three years with Boston, Fossum moved between the bullpen and the rotation, compiling 14 victories with two saves in 75 games. After a recurrence of tendinitis in his pitching shoulder, he underwent surgery in September 2003. Two months later, he was sent to the Arizona Diamondbacks in the trade that brought Curt Schilling to the Red Sox.\n\nIn 2004, Fossum played for the Arizona Diamondbacks, and for the first time in his career, he was used exclusively as a starting pitcher. He finished third on the Diamondbacks staff in starts (27), innings pitched (142) and strikeouts (117), despite missing the first 5½ weeks to recover from surgery.\n\nBefore the 2005 season, Fossum was traded to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays for outfielder José Cruz, Jr..\n\nIn 2006, Fossum was 6-6, with a 5.33 ERA in 25 starts.\n\nOn August 10, 2007, the Devil Rays released Fossum. At the time of his release, his ERA was 7.70 in 40 games.\n\nHe signed a minor league contract with the San Diego Padres on August 22, but never pitched for them.\n\nOn January 24, 2008, Fossum signed a minor-league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Pittsburgh Pirates. At the end of spring training, he declined his assignment to the minor leagues and elected to become a free agent. On April 9, 2008, Fossum signed a minor league contract with the Detroit Tigers. On June 3, his contract was purchased by the Tigers, after the DFA of right-handed pitcher Francisco Cruceta, and he was added to the active roster.\n\nOn January 16, 2009, Fossum signed a minor league contract with the New York Mets. He pitched three innings for the Mets, allowing one run, and was then designated for assignment.\n\nOn May 2, 2009, Fossum signed a minor league contract with the New York Yankees, making his first start for the AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees that day. On June 24, Fossum opted out of his contract and became a free agent.\n\nOn July 3, 2009, Fossum signed a minor league contract with the Chicago Cubs.\n\nOn February 9, 2011, Fossum signed a contract with the New York Mets.\n\nOn February 2, 2012, Fossum signed a minor league contract with the Baltimore Orioles. He was released on April 16.\n\nFossum throws three different overhand curveballs. The first curveball is a tight-rotating 1–7 curveball that has a velocity in the low to mid 70s, but a pitch that Fossum struggles to throw effectively over the plate for strikes and at times remains too flat. The second curveball is also a 1–7 pitch, has a moderate break while clocking in between 65–70 MPH, and can effectively throw for strikes. The third curveball is a 12–6 curveball with a large break, making it difficult to hit. While the pitch has been a very effective pitch for him to use, often landing for strikes or causing popouts, he regulates the pitch as a change-of-pace pitch to prevent batters from becoming used to it. Fossum dubbed this pitch the \"Fossum flip\", and it is essentially a form of the eephus pitch. He also has a decent fastball in the 88–92 mph range and a changeup that while effective, does not drop as well as the average changeup. Fossum is also a good fielder and has an above-average pickoff move.\n\nFossum's biggest knock is his stamina. Weighing in at 160 lbs, Fossum has a somewhat violent throwing style and has been injured a few times in his career. In 2004, he missed the first five weeks of the season with a sore elbow, and near the end of the 2005 season his effectiveness was reduced to what he and Lou Piniella attributed to lower back pain. For a relief pitcher, Fossum is also very good at holding runners on base. In 2004, baserunners managed to steal 15 bases out of 23 attempts (a 65.2% success rate), and in 2005, only 10 basestealers out of 14 attempts were successful (a 71.4% rate). The league averages in those seasons were 69% and 70% respectively, but relievers tend to allow higher rates than starters.\n"}

Also, people partake of Mormon culture to some degree as a result of having been raised in the LDS Church or else having converted and spent a large portion of one's life as an active member of the LDS Church. Such \"cultural\" Mormons may or may not be actively involved with the church. In some cases may not even be, or have ever been, official members of the church.\n\nMany cultural Mormons possess a strongly Mormon identity and abide with an appreciation for the lessons and the love they have received in the course of long church membership. Cultural Mormons do not necessarily hold anti-Mormon sentiments and often support the goals of the church. Many retain a sense of Mormon identity for life.\n\nBoth secular Mormons and progressive Mormons are sometimes referred to as on the left side of the religious spectrums; the more typical mainstream Mormons, in the center; and religious Mormons dissidents who disagree with certain changes to \"original teachings\" within Mormonism, on the right. Segments of the right include both fundamentalist Mormons and dissidents who participate in the Remnant movement.\n\nThe LDS Church tolerates a certain amount of disbelief in its doctrines and practices; but, in certain instances it might consider them grounds for disciplinary action.\n\nLDS Church leaders teach that certain doubts can be resolved by \"instruction, study, and prayer, which result in increased testimony, which drives out further doubts.\" However, disbelief in certain core doctrines (e.g.: the role of Jesus Christ as Savior and Redeemer; sustaining the leaders of the church as fulfilling their roles as prophets, seers, and revelators; etc.) can prevent a Mormon from participating in certain activities, such as priesthood ordinances and temple worship. Some Mormons keep certain doubts secret in order to participate in such activities, or to avoid conflict with family and friends. \n\nDisciplinary action on the grounds of apostasy may result when a member of the LDS Church \npublicly opposes church doctrines.\n\nFearing that divulging any heterodoxy may result in stigmatization by mainstream LDS, some Mormons prefer anonymity. Many participate in Internet communities, where they can discuss their issues anonymously.\n\nOne such group refers to itself as the New Order Mormons, a name patterned on the term New Order Amish (Amish who maintain cultural ties to their religion while not accepting some of its core tenets). This is a group of Mormons and former Mormons who no longer believe at least some of the tenets of the LDS Church, but because of family or cultural ties do not choose to completely separate themselves from the faith.\n\nHumanistic Mormonism is a movement of freethinkers, cultural Mormons, disfellowshipped or independents related to LDS Church and other Latter Day Saint groups that emphasize Mormon culture and history, but do not demand belief in a supernatural god, or the historicity of the Bible or the Book of Mormon. It is based on humanism and can be summarized in some points.\n\n\nThe Society for Humanistic Mormonism characterizes itself as a \"new worldwide religion of Humanistic Mormonism\" with its own \"General Authorities and Administrative Officers\", and with its own unique doctrines, such as a \"Covenant of Comedy and Humor\".\n\n"}

The Old Bridge stood for 427 years, until it was destroyed on 9 November 1993 by Croat paramilitary forces during the Croat–Bosniak War. Subsequently, a project was set in motion to reconstruct it; the rebuilt bridge opened on 23 July 2004.\n\nThe bridge is considered an exemplary piece of Balkan Islamic architecture and was commissioned by Suleiman the Magnificent in 1557. It was designed by Mimar Hayruddin, a student and apprentice of architect Mimar Sinan who built many of the Sultan's key buildings in Istanbul and around the empire.\n\nThe bridge spans the Neretva river in the old town of Mostar, the city to which it gave the name. The city is the fifth-largest in the country; it is the center of the Herzegovina-Neretva Canton of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the unofficial capital of Herzegovina. The Stari Most is hump-backed, wide and long, and dominates the river from a height of . Two fortified towers protect it: the Halebija tower on the northeast and the Tara tower on the southwest, called \"the bridge keepers\" (natively \"mostari\").\n\nInstead of foundations, the bridge has abutments of limestone linked to wing walls along the waterside cliffs. Measuring from the summer water level of , abutments are erected to a height of , from which the arch springs to its high point. The start of the arch is emphasized by a molding in height. The rise of the arch is .\n\nThe original bridge replaced an older wooden suspension bridge of dubious stability. Construction began in 1557 and took nine years: according to the inscription the bridge was completed in 974 AH, corresponding to the period between 19 July 1566 and 7 July 1567. Little is known of the construction of the bridge, thought to have been made from mortar made with egg whites, and all that has been preserved in writing are memories and legends and the name of the builder, Mimar Hayruddin. Charged under pain of death to construct a bridge of such unprecedented dimensions, Hayruddin reportedly prepared for his own funeral on the day the scaffolding was finally removed from the completed structure. Upon its completion it was the widest man-made arch in the world. \n\nThe 17th Century Ottoman explorer Evliya Çelebi wrote that the bridge \"is like a rainbow arch soaring up to the skies, extending from one cliff to the other... I, a poor and miserable slave of Allah, have passed through 16 countries, but I have never seen such a high bridge. It is thrown from rock to rock as high as the sky.\"\n\nAs Mostar's economic and administrative importance grew with the growing presence of Ottoman rule, the precarious wooden suspension bridge over the Neretva gorge required replacement. The old bridge on the river \"...was made of wood and hung on chains,\" wrote the Ottoman geographer Katip Çelebi, and it \"...swayed so much that people crossing it did so in mortal fear\". In 1566, Mimar Hayruddin designed the bridge, which was said to have cost 300,000 Drams (silver coins) to build. The two-year construction project was supervised by Karagoz Mehmet Bey, Sultan Suleiman's son-in-law and the patron of Mostar's most important mosque complex, the Hadzi Mehmed Karadzozbeg Mosque.\n\nThe Old Bridge was destroyed on November 9, 1993 in the War in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in a standoff that lasted about 24 hours; a temporary cable bridge was erected after it collapsed into the river below.\n\nNewspapers based in Sarajevo reported that more than 60 shells hit the bridge before it collapsed. Croatian General and sentenced war-criminal, Slobodan Praljak, in attempt to absolve himself and his military units from responsibility and prosecution for the destruction of the bridge and other crimes committed during the war, published a document, \"How the Old Bridge Was Destroyed\", where he argues that there was supposedly an explosive charge or mine placed at the center of the bridge underneath and detonated remotely, in addition to the shelling, which caused the collapse. Most historians dismiss these claims, and disagree with its conclusions.\n\nAfter the destruction of the Stari Most, a spokesman for the Croats said that they deliberately destroyed it, because it was of strategic importance. Academics have argued that the bridge held little strategic value and that its shelling was an example of deliberate cultural property destruction. Given that mosques, synagogues, and churches in Mostar were in close proximity, the Old Bridge was targeted for the symbolic significance it served in connecting diverse communities. Andras Riedlmayer terms the destruction an act of \"killing memory\", in which evidence of a shared cultural heritage and peaceful co-existence were deliberately destroyed.\n\nBoth sides of the city remained linked until the bridge's reconstruction by the Spanish and Portuguese military engineers assigned to the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) mission.\n\nAfter the end of the war, plans were raised to reconstruct the bridge. The World Bank, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the Aga Khan Trust for Culture and the World Monuments Fund formed a coalition to oversee the reconstruction of the Stari Most and the historic city centre of Mostar. Additional funding was provided by Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey, Croatia and the Council of Europe Development Bank, as well as the Bosnian government. In October 1998, UNESCO established an international committee of experts to oversee the design and reconstruction work. It was decided to build a bridge as similar as possible to the original, using the same technology and materials. The bridge was re-built with local materials and Ottoman construction techniques by the Turkish company Er-Bu. Tenelia, a fine-grained limestone, sourced from local quarries was used and Hungarian army divers recovered stones from the original bridge from the river below, although most were too damaged to repurpose. Reconstruction commenced on 7 June 2001. The reconstructed bridge was inaugurated on 23 July 2004, with the cost estimated to be 15.5 million US dollars.\n\nStari Most diving is a traditional annual competition in diving organized every year in mid summer (end of July). It is traditional for the young men of the town to leap from the bridge into the Neretva. As the Neretva is very cold, this is a risky feat and requires skill and training, though TripAdvisor has said tourists do dive as well. In 1968 a formal diving competition was inaugurated and held every summer. The first person to jump from the bridge since it was re-opened was Enej Kelecija.\n\nSince 2015, Stari Most has been a tour stop in the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series.\n\n\n\n"}

It is the opposite of a strut or column, which is designed to resist compression. Ties may be made of any tension resisting material.\n\nIn wood frame construction they are generally made of galvanized steel.\nWood framing ties generally have holes allowing them to be fastened to the wood structure by nails or screws. The number and type of nails are specific to the tie and its use. The manufacturer generally specifies information as to the connection method for each of their products. Among the most common wood framing ties used is the hurricane tie or seismic tie used in the framing of wooden structures where wind uplift or seismic overturning is a concern.\n\nA hurricane tie is used to help make a structure (specifically wooden structures) more resistant to high winds (such as in hurricanes), resisting uplift, racking, overturning, and sliding.\nEach of the crucial connections in a structure, that would otherwise fail under the pressures of high winds, have a corresponding type of tie, generally made of galvanized or stainless steel, and intended to resist hurricane-force and other strong winds.\n\nA connecting tie that provides a continuous structural load transfer path from the top of a building to its foundation, helping to protect buildings from damage resulting from high wind. These devices are primarily used in areas affected by high winds including hurricanes and are generally suitable for any area that may be impacted by windstorm damage. They are also known as hurricane clip or strips. Among the most common style used along the gulf coast area are plywood fasteners or oriented strand boards over the windows and openings of brick homes. Hurricane clips meet the minimum requirements for code approval and are only as strong as their weakest install point; which is generally half the strength of the wood.\n\nA hurricane clip has two meanings in building construction:\n\nSeismic tie provides facility to securely fix cabinets, bookcases, desks, appliances, machinery & equipment to walls and/or floors to constrain their movement during earthquakes.\nTop mount, face mount, sloped/skewed, and variable pitch hangers for dimensional lumber, engineered wood I-joists, structural composite lumber and masonry wall. To give added strength in increase various load requirements over wood only.\n\nWhen building subfloor the joists must always bear on the ledge for all it support. The use of steel stap tie to connect opposite joist when the top of the joists and beam are flush.\n\nTwist straps provide a tension connection between two wood members. They resist uplift at the heel of a truss economically. When the strengthening is being done from the inside, the ideal connector to use is one that connects rafters or trusses directly to wall studs. This can only be done where the rafter or trusses are immediately above or immediately to the side of studs below. In that case a twist strap connector can be used.\n\nA connector for connecting wall studs of two adjacent floors in a light frame building structure, the connector having a first attachment tab, a seat member, a diagonally slanted support leg, and a second attachment tab, all substantially planar. The connector is intended to be paired and the paired connectors joined by an elongated tie member that pierces the sill plates of the intervening floor structure.\n\nSometimes referred to as an angle brace. The Angle tie is used to prevent displacement of building elements due to thrust. A brace/tie across an interior angle of a wooden frame, forming the hypotenuse and securing the two side pieces together.\n\nSimilar to a French cleat, a Z-Clip allows for the installation of wall panels without screwing into the front of the panels. The clips provide a secure mount for wall panels, partitions, frames, cabinets, and more. Once installed, clips wedge together to lock panels in place. To disengage panels, simply lift and remove.\n\nSee \n\nRafter ties are designed to tie together the bottoms of opposing rafters on a roof, to resist the outward thrust where the roof meets the house ceiling and walls. This helps keep walls from spreading due to the weight of the roof and anything on it, notably wet snow. In many or most homes, the ceiling joists also serve as the rafter ties. When the walls spread, the roof ridge will sag. A sagging ridge is one clue that the home may lack adequate rafter ties. Rafter ties form the bottom chord of a simple triangular roof truss. They resist the out-thrust of a triangle that's trying to flatten under the roof's own weight or snow load. They are placed in the bottom one-third of the roof height. Rafter ties are always required unless the roof has a structural (self-supporting) ridge, or is built using engineered trusses. A lack of rafter ties is a serious structural issue in a conventionally framed roof.\nA wooden beam serving this purpose is known as a tie-beam and a roof incorporating tie-beams is known as a tie-beam roof.\n\n"}
{"id": "2110232", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2110232", "title": "List of horn techniques", "text": "List of horn techniques\n\nSome of these horn techniques are not unique to the horn, but are applicable to most or all wind instruments.\"\n\nThis is the act of fully closing off the bell of the instrument with either the right hand or a special stopping mute. This results in producing a somewhat nasal sound. When required, in the sheet music the usual notation is a '+' above the note followed by a 'o' above notes that are to be played open. For longer stopped passages, the word indicating a stopped horn is written out.\n\nThe pitch lowers gradually when the hand is placed in the bell and slowly moved inward. When the bell is completely covered (stopped), the pitch falls to a half-step above the next lower partial (harmonic). For example, playing a middle C (F-horn, open) and gradually covering the bell into stopped horn, the pitch will lower a major 3rd to A (or 1/2 step above G, the next lower partial). However, playing a 3rd space C (F-horn, open) and repeating the stopped horn, the pitch will lower a half-step to a B-natural (or 1/2 step above B, the next lower partial). The hand horn technique developed in the classical period, with music pieces requiring the use of covering the bell to various degrees to lower the pitch accordingly. Mozart's four Horn Concertos, Concert Rondo and Morceau de Concert were written with this technique in mind, as was the music both Beethoven and Brahms wrote for the horn. \n\nSome modern composers have incorrectly notated that the horn is to bend an open pitch upward to a stopped pitch. This is impossible. The horn pitch can only be bent downward into a stopped pitch. It is believed that players play the next harmonic higher without realising and this has given rise to this erroneous belief.\n\nThere is also an effect that is occasionally called for, usually in French music, called \"echo horn\", \"hand mute\" or \"\"sons d'écho\"\" (see Dukas's \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\") which is like stopped horn, but different in that the bell is not closed as tightly. The player closes the hand enough so that the pitch drops 1/2 step, but, especially in the middle register, this is not closed as tightly as for stopped horn. Consequently, when playing echo horn, the player fingers one half step higher.\n\nAlso, the hand can be partially inserted into the bell in such a fashion as to lower the pitch of the horn one quarter tone, an extended technique used in some modern compositions today.\n\nBefore the advent of the valve horn, a player would increase the number of playable notes beyond the normal harmonic series by changing the position of his/her hand in the bell. It is possible to use a combination of stopping, hand-muting (3/4 stopping), and half-stopping (to correct notes that would otherwise be out of tune) to play almost every note of a mid-range chromatic scale on one fingering. Most modern pieces for hand-horn tend to spend more time in the higher ranges, as there are more notes that can be played naturally (without altering hand position and maintaining pure tone) above the 8th note of any harmonic series. The most well known natural hornist virtuoso who was in the classical period was Giovanni Punto, which is said to have been able to play 'anything' on his natural horn\n\nMany older pieces for horn were written for a horn not keyed in F as is standard today. As a result, a requirement for modern orchestra hornists is to be able to read music directly in these keys. This is most commonly done by transposing the music on the fly into F. A reliable way to transpose is to liken the written notes (which rarely deviate from written C, D, E, F, G, and occasionally A) to their counterparts in the scale the F horn will be playing in.\n\nCommonly seen transpositions include:\n\n\nSome less common transpositions include:\nIt has been speculated that one of the reasons Brahms wrote for horn in the awkward key of B(♮) was to encourage the horn players to use the natural horn; he did not like the sound of the new valved horns and wrote all his horn parts playable for natural horn, same as Carl Maria von Weber did.\n\nSometimes it is unclear as to whether a piece should be transposed up or down (i.e. B alto versus B basso when only B is written). Various factors can be taken into account when choosing e.g. which direction keeps the music in the horn's normal range. Also the history of the composer can be used. For Haydn symphonies which include trumpet parts, the lower transposition for the horns is usually correct; otherwise, the high transposition is usually correct. Sometimes multiple pitches were used to get a greater number of available tones. This is especially true for works in minor keys to be able to play the minor third (e.g. Mozart Symphony Nr. 40)\n\nNormal tonguing consists of interrupting the air stream by tapping the back of the front teeth with the tongue as said in the syllables 'da', 'ta', 'doo', or 'too'. Double tonguing consists of alternating between the 'ta' and the 'ka' sounds or between the 'da' and 'ga' sounds. The tongue makes the same movement as if the player is repeatedly saying 'kitty' or 'ticket.' Triple tonguing is most used for patterns of three notes and is made with the syllables 'ta-ta-ka', 'ta-ka-ta', or 'da-ga-da.'\n\nA lip trill is a rapid oscillation between neighboring harmonics - used primarily for whole-step trills from second-line G up approximately an octave. Lip trills are possible both lower and higher, but much lower than E and the harmonics are too far apart for a whole step, and much higher and harmonics are too narrow. Many books give fingering charts for lip trills, but the double horn gives further options. In his book \"The Horn\", Barry Tuckwell also gives a fingering chart of possible 'faux' 1/2 step lip trills.\n\nMultiphonics is the act of producing more than one pitch simultaneously on the horn. To do this, one note is produced as normal while another is sung. One of its earliest uses occurs in the Concertino for Horn and Orchestra by Carl Maria von Weber (Norman del Mar believed these chords to be impossible to play ).\n\nAnother kind of multiphonics can be achieved by simultaneously playing two neighbouring notes of the harmonic series.\n\nInformation on this subject can be found at the article on circular breathing.\n\nOn some horns, depending on the type of valves fitted, a high F' (concert pitch) can sound out while pressing the first valve of the F side down halfway.\n\nA high D can be obtained by pulling out completely the first tuning slide of the F-horn.\n\n"}

The sparsely populated territory abounds with natural scenic beauty, with snowmelt lakes and perennial white-capped mountains, including many of Canada's highest mountains. The territory's climate is Arctic in the north (north of Old Crow), subarctic in the central region, between north of Whitehorse and Old Crow, and has a humid continental climate in the far south, south of Whitehorse and in areas close to the British Columbia border. The long sunshine hours in the short summer allow a profusion of flowers and fruit to blossom. Most of the territory is boreal forest, tundra being the main vegetation zone only in the extreme north and at high elevations.\n\nThe territory is about the shape of a right triangle, bordering the American state of Alaska to the west, the Northwest Territories to the east and British Columbia to the south. Yukon covers 482,443 km, of which 474,391 km is land and 8,052 km is water, making it the forty-first largest subnational entity in the world, and, among the fifty largest, the least populous.\n\nIt is bounded on the south by the 60th parallel of latitude. Its northern coast is on the Beaufort Sea. Its western boundary is 141° west longitude. Its ragged eastern boundary mostly follows the divide between the Yukon River Basin and the Mackenzie River watershed to the east in the Mackenzie mountains.\n\nExcept for the coastal plain on the Beaufort Sea (Arctic Ocean) coast, most of Yukon is part of the American cordillera. The terrain includes mountain ranges, plateaus and river valleys.\n\nThe southwest is dominated by the Kluane icefields in Kluane National Park and Reserve, the largest non-polar icefields in the Poles. Kluane National Park also contains eight of Canada's ten highest mountains, including the five highest, all in the Saint Elias Mountains. A number of glaciers flow out of the icefields, including the Logan Glacier, the Hubbard Glacier and the Kaskawulsh Glacier.\n\nPermafrost is common. The northern part of Yukon has continuous permafrost, while it is widespread in the central part. Even the southern Yukon has scattered patches of permafrost.\n\nTwo major faults, the Denali Fault and the Tintina Fault have created major valleys called trenches: the Shakwak Trench and the Tintina Trench. The Shakwak Trench separates the Kluane ranges from other mountain ranges north of it. The Haines Highway and the Alaska Highway north of Haines Junction are built in the Shakwak Trench. The Tintina Trench bisects the Yukon from northwest to southeast and its edges have rich mineral deposits including the Klondike gold and the lead-zinc deposits near Faro.\n\nThe volcanoes in Yukon are part of the circle of volcanoes around the Pacific Ocean known as the Pacific Ring of Fire. Yukon includes more than 100 separate volcanic centres that have been active during the Quaternary. The Fort Selkirk Volcanic Field in central Yukon is the northernmost Holocene volcanic field in Canada, including the young active cinder cone, Volcano Mountain. A volcanic field in south-central Yukon is called Alligator Lake volcanic complex. It contains two well-preserved cinder cones that caps a small shield volcano. Lava from the cones travelled north and were erupted at the same time. Volcanoes in south-western Yukon are part of the Wrangle Volcanic Field, which is related to the subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath the North American Plate at the easternmost end of the Avalanche Trench.\n\nYukon volcanoes include:\n\n\nThe Saint Elias mountains are part of the Coast Mountains which range from southern British Columbia to Alaska and cover the southeastern Yukon. While the Saint Elias Mountains contain the highest mountains, there are numerous other mountain ranges, from the British Mountains in the far north and the Richardson Mountains in the northeast, both of which are part of the Brooks Range, to the Selwyn Mountains and Mackenzie Mountains in the east, the Cassiar Mountains in the south-east, the Pelly Mountains in the central Yukon, and the Ogilvie Mountains north\nof Dawson City and along the Dempster Highway.\n\nYukon mountain ranges include:\n\nSee also: List of Yukon lakes and List of Yukon rivers\n\nMost of the territory is in the watershed of its namesake, the Yukon River, which flows into the Bering Sea. Southern Yukon is dotted with a large number of large, long and narrow glacier-fed alpine lakes, most of which flow into the Yukon River system. The larger lakes include: Teslin Lake, Atlin Lake, Tagish Lake, Marsh Lake, Lake Laberge, Kusawa Lake, Kluane Lake. Bennett Lake on the Klondike Gold Rush trail is a smaller lake flowing into Tagish Lake.\n\nOther rivers flow either directly into the Pacific Ocean or directly or indirectly into the Arctic Ocean. The Alsek-Tatshenshini drainage flows directly into the Pacific from southwestern Yukon. A number of rivers in northern Yukon flow directly into the Arctic Ocean. The two main Yukon rivers flowing into the Mackenzie River in the Northwest Territories are the Liard River in the southeast and the Peel River and its tributaries in the northeast.\n\nMost of Yukon has a subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification Dfc), characterized by long cold winters and brief warm summers. The airstrip at Snag, 25 kilometres east of Beaver Creek near the Alaska border, experienced the lowest ever temperature measured in North America, -63.0 °C (-81.4 °F) on February 3, 1947. The Arctic Ocean coast has a Tundra climate (ET). The climate is generally very dry, with little precipitation, but is considerably wetter in the southeast. Precipitation is much greater in the mountains, and the snowpack continues to melt well into the summer, resulting in high water in July or August.\nSource: Environment Canada\n\nExcept for the Arctic Ocean coastal plain and high elevations, most of Yukon is in the boreal forest ecoregion. Most mountain peaks and higher elevations are characterized by Alpine tundra while the coastal plain is Arctic coastal tundra. More precisely, according to Environment Canada's ecozone definitions, southern and central Yukon is part of the Boreal Cordillera Ecozone while the northern forest is part of the Taiga Cordillera Ecozone. The Peel River area in the northeast is in the Taiga Plains Ecozone and the Arctic coast is in the Southern Arctic Ecozone.\n\nBlack spruce (\"Picea mariana\"), white spruce (\"Picea glauca\"), quaking aspen (\"Populus tremuloides\") and balsam poplar (\"Populus balsamifera\") are found throughout much of the territory. Although relatively uncommon, the Alaska birch (\"Betula neoalaskana\") is also found in most areas. The lodgepole pine (\"Pinus contorta\") reaches its northern extreme in the south-central part of the territory, while tamarack (\"Larix laricina\") is found in the southeast and the subalpine fir (\"Abies lasiocarpa\") is found at higher elevations in the southern part of the territory.\n\nThe large mammals found throughout the territory include caribou (\"Rangifer tarandus\", both barren-ground and woodland), moose (\"Alces alces\"), wolves (\"Canis lupus\"), grizzly bears (\"Ursus arctos horribilis\") and American black bears (\"Ursus americanus\"). Higher elevation have Dall sheep (\"Ovis dalli\") and, in the south, Rocky Mountain goat (\"Oreamnos americanus\"). polar bears (\"Ursus maritimus\") are found on the Arctic coast. The mule deer (\"Odocoileus hermionus\") and its predator, the cougar (\"Puma concolor\"), are becoming increasingly common in the south, and coyotes (\"Canis latrans\") are increasing their range to the northern Yukon. Elk and bison have been introduced.\n\nThere are many species of rodents, including squirrels, ground squirrels, lemmings, pikas, beavers, various voles, porcupines, muskrats, etc. Mustelids are also well represented and include the wolverine (\"Gulo gulo\"), marten (\"Martes americana\"), ermine (\"Mustela erminea\"), least weasel (\"Mustela nivalis\"), American mink (\"Mustela vison\"), and the river otter (\"Lontra canadensis\"). Other small carnivores present are the lynx (\"Lynx canadensis\"), red fox (\" Vulpes vulpes\") and Arctic fox (\"Alopex lagopus\") along the northern coast.\n\nMore than 250 species of birds have been sighted in Yukon. The common raven (\"Corvus corax\") is the territorial bird and is common everywhere. Other common resident birds include bald eagles (\"Haliaeetus leucocephalus\"), golden eagles (\"Aquila chrysaetos\"), gyrfalcon (\"Falco rusticolus\") and peregrine falcon (\"Falco peregrinus\"), five species of grouse (spruce grouse, blue grouse, ruffed grouse, ptarmigan, and white-tailed ptarmigan). Many migratory birds breed in the Yukon, as it is at the northern end of the Pacific Flyway.\n\nOther than the burbot and northern pike, most of the large fish found in Yukon rivers, lakes and streams are salmonids. Four species of Pacific salmon (Chinook, sockeye, coho and chum) breed in Yukon rivers and lakes in the Pacific and Yukon River watersheds. The Yukon River has the longest freshwater migration route of any salmon; Chinook salmon swim over 3,000 kilometres from its mouth in the Bering Sea to spawning grounds upstream of Whitehorse. There are also land-locked kokanee (sockeye salmon) and rainbow trout. chars are represented by lake trout present in most large Yukon lakes, as well as Dolly Varden, bull trout and Arctic char. The Arctic grayling is ubiquitous, while the lakes have various whitefish and inconnu.\n\nThere are no reptiles in Yukon, but a few frogs.\n\nYukon is sparsely populated, with about 30,000 inhabitants in a territory almost as large as Spain or Sweden. Population density is 0.06 people per km. Close to three quarters of the population is in the Whitehorse area, and the rest live in a number of other communities. All except Old Crow are accessible by road.\n\nThe capital, Whitehorse, is also the largest city with more than two thirds of the population; the second largest is Dawson City, (pop. 1800) which was the capital until 1952.\n\nTraditionally, Yukon was inhabited by nomadic Athapaskan-speaking First Nations people who had established extensive trading networks with the Pacific Coast Tlingit. The interior people traded copper, furs and meat for coastal products such as eulachon oil. About 20% of the Yukon population is of aboriginal origin.\n\nThere is no Inuit population in Yukon, although there was a population along the Arctic Ocean coast within historic times. The Inuit were decimated by disease and disappeared in the 19th century. In 1984, the Government of Canada included the Yukon North Slope within the Inuvialuit Settlement Region under the auspices of the Inuvialuit.\n\nThe following table presents the population of most Yukon communities. Note that the Census data represents those people who lived within the community boundaries, while the Yukon Bureau of Statistics (YBS) includes everyone with a postal address in the community. Typically, many people live immediately outside the community boundaries, hence the larger YBS numbers.\n\n \n \n\nYukon has abundant mineral resources and mining was the mainstay of the economy until recently. Abundant gold was found in the Klondike region leading to the Klondike Gold Rush of 1898. Placer gold is found in many streams and rivers, and there is an active placer mining industry in the Klondike and many other parts of Yukon to this day.\n\nOther minerals that have been actively mined include copper in the Whitehorse area, lead and zinc in Faro, silver, zinc and lead in the Mayo/Keno City area, asbestos in Clinton Creek, and copper, gold, and coal in the Carmacks area. The world's largest known deposit of tungsten is in the Macmillan Pass area in the Mackenzie Mountains near the Northwest Territories border. Non-metallic minerals mined have included jade and barite.\n\nThe fur trade was very important to the Yukon First Nation economy, but low prices and the impact of animal rights activists have devastated the traditional economy.\n\nThere are three hydroelectric generating stations in Yukon: one at Schwatka Lake in Whitehorse, another near Mayo and a third on Aishihik Lake.\n\nWhile Yukon is mostly covered with forests, most of the trees are small and take a long time to grow and regenerate because of the dry cold climate. There is a considerable amount of small scale logging, but the only area that can sustain industrial forestry is in the southeast with its wetter climate. However, distance from markets and fluctuating prices have resulted in a boom-and-bust industry.\n\nA small amount of natural gas is currently produced in the southeast, but little exploration has been done in other parts of the Yukon. It is believed that there are abundant natural gas fields in the Eagle Plains area along the Dempster Highway and possibly in the Whitehorse area, but distance from pipelines has hampered exploration.\n\nGlobal warming is affecting the north more than other parts of the world and Yukon is no exception. While residents might welcome warmer temperatures, the ultimate effects are not known. Higher temperatures would mean more evaporation and drying out an already dry climate, resulting in more forest fires and reducing the biological productivity of boreal forests, whose growth is limited more by lack of moisture than temperature. Also glaciers are likely to melt, and permafrost likely to thaw.\n\nYukon is also the recipient of airborne pollutants from other parts of the world, especially persistent organic pollutants. Consumption of the liver of certain wild animals and fish is no longer recommended because of these.\n\nLocally, mine reclamation and dealing with mine tailings that cause acid mine drainage left over from mine closures is a major problem and is likely to cost hundreds of millions of dollars to clean up.\n\nIn an effort to encourage natural resource exploration, the previous (2002–2011) Yukon Party government led by Dennis Fentie has suspended the application of the Protected Areas Strategy (established by a previous Yukon New Democratic Party government) and has indicated its intention of not creating additional protected areas or parks.\n\nThe Gwichʼin people of Old Crow are dependent on the Porcupine caribou herd for food and clothing, as are others in the Yukon. The Porcupine caribou herd migrates to the coastal plain in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska to give birth. That herd may be seriously threatened by oil-drilling in the ANWR.\n\n\n"}

Walt Disney Records released the \"Go Figure\" soundtrack on June 7, featuring the title track by Everlife along with a music video.\n\nA talented young teenage figure skater named Katelin Kingsford dreams of being a champion. During one of her competitions, she is discovered by a famous Russian skating coach, Natasha Goberman. However, Natasha coaches at an expensive boarding school and Katelin's parents cannot afford to send her there. To help Katelin with the expenses, Natasha convinces the girls hockey team coach to give the last hockey scholarship to Katelin so she can train at the boarding school. Katelin is overjoyed and excited to be taught by Natasha but quickly learns that juggling hockey practice, skate club practice, and her homework is much harder than she imagined. A student assistant coach for the hockey team named Spencer constantly ridicules her, and her fellow skaters in the figure skating club are just as rude. Katelin is also forced to hide all of her precious figure-skating-related belongings, as the hockey coach warns her that the girls on the hockey team despise \"twirl girls\". However, Katelin does find some solace in her roommate, Hollywood Henderson, a fellow hockey player. She finds out that Katelin is a figure skater, but promises not to tell anyone.\n\nKatelin faces multiple obstacles in her new life. Pamela, a figure skater jealous of Katelin's skill and Natasha's obvious liking towards her, locks her in the janitor's closet during a party and sets a trap for her to end up having a can of purple paint dumped on her. Because of this, Katelin loses a private training session with one of her idols, Kristi Yamaguchi, to Pamela, causing Natasha to feel great disappointment towards Katelin. Her teammates on the hockey team turn on her after their first game, when Katelin did not block for the team captain and caused her to be tackled by the opposing team. Katelin works hard to improve, but is overwhelmed and feels like quitting.\n\nKatelin begins flunking her schoolwork as well. Combined with the hostility of the hockey team, the stress gets to her and she gets on a bus home. When she arrives at her house, she finds that her parents have packed up all of her things in boxes. Feeling unwanted, Katelin grabs a box of her ice skating things and runs out of the house. As she sits on a bench and rummages through her belongings, she finds that her mother was a \"twirl girl\" as well when she sees a picture of her mother on the ice and prizes from various competitions in the box. After talking with her mother, Katelin decides that she's not going to quit no matter how hard things may seem, and she goes back to school.\n\nA great change occurs in Katelin. She pushes herself harder now to do her best in everything, including hockey. She is the first to arrive for practice and she improves greatly. Katelin spends a lot of time studying and her grades improve drastically. She spends hours practicing both hockey and figure skating alone. Spencer, who overheard a conversation between Natasha and the hockey coach, knows that Katelin is a figure skater and admires her even more for it due to her drastic improvement. In their first game of the season, Katelin's practice pays off when she helps her team win. With Katelin, the girls hockey team is suddenly on a winning streak. She starts to teach the hockey team about balancing with ballet, and uses her brother's ice hockey tactics to improve their team's performance, bringing the team to the finals for the first time in 7 years.\n\nLater on, when the coach announces the date of the finals, Katelin realizes that it is also the same day as the Senior Nationals, an event that scouts for potential Olympic figure skaters. She is extremely confused and has no idea what she should do. Spencer, Hollywood, and Natasha all push her to go to the Nationals, as Hollywood insists that Katelin won't be able to skate in the Olympics if she doesn't go to the competition. However, Katelin still feels conflicted, as she feels that she will be letting down her teammates on the hockey team. In the end, Katelin shows up at the hockey game, much to Spencer's disbelief. They lose the finals by one goal, but the team is far from disappointed, saying that they were happy to have made it into the finals and that they will have another chance next season.\n\nSpencer gathers all of Katelin's figure skating equipment and takes her to the Senior Nationals, but her suitcase falls open in front of the hockey team before they can make it out and they see all of her stuffed animals and dresses. Katelin runs away in embarrassment. In the car, Spencer gives her the dress. \"It's perfect,\" Katelin exclaims before kissing Spencer on the cheek. While getting ready, Katelin realizes that one of her skates is missing, and that it must have fallen out when she was running in a hurry. She tells Natasha that she will skate in her hockey skates instead, but that fails when she falls right in the beginning of her skating routine. However, the entire hockey team arrives with her missing skate. Natasha tries to get the judges to let her restart, but when they refuse, the hockey team starts a chant of \"Let her skate!\", which soon echoes throughout the entire stadium. The judges relent and allow Katelin another chance to perform. She does a wonderful job on her routine. The hockey team rushes forward at the end of her performance and hoists her onto her shoulders. Spencer gives her a large bouquet of flowers. The judges announce that Katelin has made it into the US Olympic team, and the movie ends with Katelin waving and smiling.\n\n\nThe soundtrack was released on June 7, 2005 in the United States. It peaked at number 23 on the \"Billboard\" Top Kid Audio.\n\n\n\"Go Figure\" was nominated in the Young Artist Awards for Best Television Movie or Special.\n\n"}

Univision Communications bought Gawker Media in August 2016 and rebranded it as Gizmodo Media Group, later renamed as G/O Media.\n\n\"Kotaku\" was first launched in October 2004 with Matthew Gallant as its lead writer, with an intended target audience of young men. About a month later, Brian Crecente was brought in to try to save the failing site. Since then, the site has launched several country-specific sites for Australia, Japan, Brazil and the UK. Previous contributors to the site include Luke Smith. Crecente was named one of the 20 most influential people in the video game industry over the past 20 years by GamePro in 2009 and one of gaming's Top 50 journalists by Edge in 2006. The site has made CNET's \"Blog 100\" list and was ranked 50th on \"PC Magazine\"s \"Top 100 Classic Web Sites\" list. Its name comes from the Japanese \"otaku\" (obsessive fan) and the prefix \"ko-\" (small in size).\n\nIn April 2014, Gawker Media partnered with Future plc to launch \"Kotaku UK\", and with Allure Media to launch \"Kotaku Australia\".\n\n\"Kotaku\" is currently run by Stephen Totilo, who replaced Brian Crecente in 2012.\n\nKotaku was one of several websites that was purchased by Univision Communications in their acquisition of Gawker Media in August 2016; Gizmodo Media Group was subsequently founded to house the Gawker acquisitions, operating under the Fusion Media Group, a division of Univision. The Gizmodo Media Group was later acquired by the private equity firm Great Hill Partners in April 2019, and renamed G/O Media. \n\nThe transition to G/O Media had let to several departures from the site, as well as from other sister sites under the form Gawker Media label due to conflicts with G/O Media's management. Cecilia D'Anastasio left \"Kotaku\" in December 2019 to become a journalist for \"Wired\". Joshua Rivera and Gita Jackson left in January 2020 stating it was impossible to work with the new management. Jason Schreier, one of \"Kotaku\"s writers since 2012 known for in-depth coverage of working conditions at various studios and development histories for various games, announced his departure from the site on April 16, 2020, citing the issues surrounding G/O Media which filtered into disruptions at their sister website \"Deadspin\" around October 2019. Schreier subsequently took a position at \"Bloomberg News\". In May 2020, senior writer Heather Alexandra departed from Kotaku, similarly citing conflicts with management, and joined Double Fine Productions as their content and community manager.\n\nIn 2007, attorney Jack Thompson sued Gawker Media and site editor Brian Crecente over concerns that \"Kotaku\" declined to remove threatening user comments, but the lawsuit was dismissed the next day. In 2009, Business Insider reported that Hearst Corporation sought to buy \"Kotaku\" from Gawker Media. In 2010, \"Kotaku\" criticized Japanese magazine Famitsu's glowing endorsement of a Konami game as a conflict of interest; Konami subsequently revoked \"Kotaku\"s invitation to the game's launch party. In 2013, \"Forbes\" criticized \"Kotaku\" over what they called an inflammatory headline in a story about Hideki Kamiya; \"Kotaku\" rewrote the headline.\n\nIn 2007, Kotaku ran a story about rumored upcoming features on the PlayStation 3, and Sony responded by temporarily blacklisting the website.

Despite winning further trophies in Portugal, his personal form dropped. After two seasons, he moved for €6 million to Werder Bremen where his form improved, winning domestic honours and helping them to the 2009 UEFA Cup Final. He also won honours at Atlético Madrid, including the UEFA Europa League in 2012. Nowadays he plays for Brazilian club Flamengo, where he has won the Copa Libertadores.\n\nA full international for Brazil since 2003, Diego earned 34 caps and scored four international goals. He was part of the Brazilian squads which finished as runners-up at the 2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup, won the Copa América in 2004 and 2007, and earned a bronze medal at the 2008 Olympics.\n\nAt age six, Diego started to show his talent when training with Comercial FC in Ribeirão Preto. After joining another team, São Carlos, when he was nine, Diego decided to take trials in the hope of impressing a bigger club. Diego was first signed by the São Paulo team Santos at the age of 12. He developed while in the Santos youth system, making his first team debut at the age of 16 in the Rio-São Paulo Championship in 2002 and in the same year won the domestic Campeonato Brasileiro championship. He, Robinho, Elano and Alex were known as a famous group when they played for Santos.\n\nDiego was then signed by Primeira Liga club Porto in July 2004 as a replacement and the potential successor for Deco, but he could not produce the same calibre of performances as he did at Santos. Diego made his debut for Porto in a 1–1 draw against União de Leiria on 22 August and on 30 October, he scored his first goal for Porto in a 2–2 draw against Nacional.\n\nAs Porto triumphed in the Intercontinental Cup against Once Caldas via a penalty shootout, Diego was sent off for swearing at goalkeeper Juan Carlos Henao after scoring his effort. Journalist Tim Vickery ascribed this action to Diego's experiences against the team in the previous season's Copa Libertadores, in which the physical Colombian side eliminated Santos in the quarter-finals.\n\nIn his first season at Porto, Diego made 30 appearances, scoring two goals against Sporting CP and Braga. In 2005–06, however, he did not maintain a stable place in the Porto team under coach Co Adriaanse and also found life difficult at Porto. He eventually left the club to sign with Werder Bremen.\n\nIn May 2006, Diego signed a contract with German Bundesliga side Werder Bremen until 2010 for a transfer fee of €6 million. His first match for Bremen came in the DFB-Ligapokal. Werder Bremen won the cup, beating Bayern Munich in the final on 5 August. The 2006–07 Bundesliga season began well for Diego. He scored the first goal and set up two more for Bremen in their 4–2 win over Hannover 96, on 13 August. In his second match in the Bundesliga, he set up both goals in the 2–1 win over Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nThanks to his good performances in August, both in the Bundesliga and in the Ligapokal, Diego won the August Player of the Month award. As the Bundesliga season progressed, Diego made several amazing performances and became one of the most valuable players for Bremen, along with his teammate Torsten Frings. Together, they were called the \"two motors of Bremen's midfield\". In October 2006, he won a second Player of the Month award, as well as again in December 2006. He was then named as the Best Player of the first half of the Bundesliga season.\n\nWerder Bremen finished in third place in Group A in the Champions League group stages, and they moved to the UEFA Cup, where they reached the semi-finals after beating AZ in the quarter-finals due in part to Diego's creative play.\n\nOn 15 April, Diego again played well, scoring in the 2–0 win over Borussia Dortmund. Five days later, on 20 April, Bremen played against Alemannia Aachen. Although Diego's performance was good, he did not score until stoppage time when he scored from 62.5 metres, which later was elected as goal of the year. Bremen won the game 3–1 and topped the table with 60 points.\n\nFollowing his good performances in the first half of the Bundesliga, Diego got called up to the Brazil national team in November.\n\nAfter the 2006–07 season ended, Diego won the Bundesliga Player of the Season award organised by popular magazine \"kicker\". He received just over 50 percent of the votes. Unfortunately, his team did not win the Bundesliga after finishing third in the table, behind champions VfB Stuttgart and Schalke 04.\n\nDiego started his season well, scoring a penalty on the first matchday. Diego gave many outstanding performances. He was crucial as Bremen progressed to the 2007–08 Champions League group stage. They beat Croatian club Dinamo Zagreb 3–2 in Zagreb, with Diego scoring two penalties.\n\nOn the first Champions League group stage matchday, Bremen lost 2–1 to Real Madrid, but Diego's performance aroused interest in Real Madrid's coach Bernd Schuster. Rumours of his departure, however, were put to an end when Diego signed a new contract which would last until 2011.\n\nAfter the loss to Real Madrid, Bremen faced VfB Stuttgart, the defending German champions, at home. Werder won 4–1, with Diego leading the midfield. Later on in the season, Bremen achieved a historical 8–1 win over Arminia Bielefeld, with Diego assisting three goals and scoring one himself.\n\nDiego was voted Player of the Month in September. He then scored two goals en route to the UEFA Cup round of 16 with Bremen, where they lost to Rangers.\n\nDiego's last season with Bremen was his most successful. He scored 20 goals in total (more than his two first seasons in the club), although Bremen did finish just tenth in the 2008–09 Bundesliga and were knocked out of the Champions League at the group stage after finishing third in their group.\n\nIn the UEFA Cup that season, Diego scored six goals, all in the knockout stages. He also scored against Milan the in round of 32, equalizing after 84 minutes, and assisting Claudio Pizarro in the second leg's only goal. He helped his team through the round of 16, and scored four of the six goals, and managed one assist in the quarter-final knockout of Udinese.\n\nIn the semi finals, after losing 1–0 in their hometown to \"North Derby\" rivals Hamburger SV, Diego helped his team back in the second leg with an early equalizer to Ivica Olić's early critical goal. Later on that game, he assisted a corner to Frank Baumann's third Bremen goal. In that game, Diego received an unfortunate yellow card, preventing him from playing in the final, and with a 3–2 away win, he ended his UEFA Cup participation, leading Bremen to their first UEFA Cup final ever.\n\nWithout Diego in the 2009 UEFA Cup Final, Bremen lost the game 2–1 in extra time to Ukrainian team Shakhtar Donetsk. In his last match with Bremen, Diego gave the assist to Mesut Özil's winning goal against Bayer Leverkusen in the DFB-Pokal final to secure Bremen's sixth title in the competition.\n\nOn 26 May 2009, Diego signed a five-year contract to join Juventus of Serie A at the end of the season 2008–09 season. The fee paid to Bremen by Juventus was worth €24.5 million, though the price can rise by a further €2.5 million in case of the fulfillment of established sports objectives in the next five years.\n\nDiego made his Juventus debut against the Korean side Seongnam, a game they won 3–0. In the first half, Diego made the pass to Mauro Camoranesi, whose pass followed up to a goal. Diego then scored in the second half and was subbed out at the 60th minute. On his Serie A debut, he assisted Vincenzo Iaquinta's goal from a set-piece. In the second fixture of the campaign, Diego recorded his first Serie A goal, scoring twice in Juventus' 3–1 victory against Roma on 30 August 2009. He also scored goals against Bologna, Fiorentina and Napoli. One of his most noted assists was his backheel to Alessandro Del Piero's goal against Genoa. He has also scored in the 2010 TIM Trophy against Milan.\n\nDiego's swaggering displays he produced during his time in Bremen were met with anger and confusion from Juventus fans; the formation did not suit him and he had a fall-out with then coach Ciro Ferrara. Juventus announced Diego would leave Juventus despite pleading to stay at the club. German clubs like VfL Wolfsburg, Bayern Munich and his former club Werder Bremen were linked to sign him. Bremen, however, ruled out signing him due to sporting director Klaus Allofs believing a deal to bring him back to Bremen would be \"economically impossible\", and Diego reiterated his desire to stay.\n\nEventually, on 27 August 2010, Diego moved from Juventus to VfL Wolfsburg for a club record transfer fee of €15.5 million, which Juve would only received €14.75 million as 5% of the transfer fee transferred to his youth clubs as solidarity contribution. Following his move to Wolfsburg, Diego criticized Juventus general director Giuseppe Marotta for his exit and is the blame for letting Juventus make huge losses on some high-profile players.\n\nIn Diego's first match for Wolfsburg, he scored his debut goal in a game which Wolfsburg lost 3–4 to Mainz 05. On 5 February 2011, he won a penalty for Wolfsburg; he subsequently took the ball from designated spot-kick taker Patrick Helmes, then hit the woodwork ten minutes from time. Wolfsburg later lost the match by one goal, prompting Wolfsburg manager Steve McClaren to fine him €100,000 (£86,000) for failing to follow instructions. Diego was defended by Dieter Hoeneß, claiming that Diego does not believe he should be banned for the incident. Nonetheless, Diego was also informed that he would be removed from the first team for Wolfsburg's upcoming game against Hamburger SV. He once again got in trouble with the management of Wolfsburg, when, on 14 May before a crucial relegation game against 1899 Hoffenheim, he left the hotel in which the team was staying when he was informed he would not be starting the game. This left Wolfsburg with only six players on the bench for the game that would determine whether they would play another season in the Bundesliga or be relegated. Wolfsburg went on to win the game 3–1 without Diego, ensuring another top flight season for the club, though Diego was fined €500,000 for his actions.\n\nAfter the 2010–11 season at Wolfsburg, new manager Felix Magath told Diego in May he had no future with the club. On the last day of the transfer season, Diego joined Atlético Madrid in La Liga on a season-long loan. On 10 September 2011, he made his debut for Atlético against Valencia. He scored his first goal for Atlético in the 60th minute of a UEFA Europa League game against Celtic to make it 2–0 and made an assist to Radamel Falcao in the third minute. The match finished in a 2–0 win for Atlético. Diego scored his first league goal in a 3–2 win over Levante on 20 November 2011.\n\nAs a key player for Atlético, Diego provided assists and established himself in the first team. But on 19 February 2012, against Sporting de Gijón, Diego sustained a hamstring injury in the second half. It was announced that Diego would be out for a month. After a month out, Diego recovered from his injury and made his return to training. Diego made his return against Real Zaragoza on 26 March 2012.\n\nOn 9 May 2012, Diego scored the third goal on Atlético's win over Athletic Bilbao in the Europa League Final, assuring the capital side won the title for the second time in three years. After the match, Diego told UEFA's official website, \"We played against a tough rival like Athletic, but we played an almost perfect match, it was a difficult match, we never said it was going to be easy. I have to thank God for this [victory].\"\n\nAtlético teammate Juanfran revealed that Diego wanted to stay at Madrid rather than go back to Germany, but confessed that it would be tough for the club to buy him outright. Diego admitted that his time with Atlético has been \"magical\", stating that his time in Spain was more than what he could have hoped for: \"This season was positive on both an individual and collective level and I'm delighted.\" and made a farewell message to the club's fans, telling them about the club will be part of his life. Seven months on, Diego revealed he was unaware over a permanent move to Atlético, as the move never transpired.\n\nDiego returned to VfL Wolfsburg following the end of his loan spell in Madrid. Upon his return, his relationship with manager Felix Magath continued to deteriorate: he was placed in the reserve side after Magath criticised his attitude on his first training session back. Despite the strained relationship between the two, he was selected by Magath in a series of pre-season friendlies in a tour of China. Although he was told by Magath he has no future in Wolfsburg, Diego nonetheless announced that he would stay at the club, as clubs overseas had no apparent interest in signing him.\n\nDiego played his first game for the club in a 1–0 victory over VfB Stuttgart on the opening game of the 2012–13 Bundesliga. In the club's first game without Magath, who had been sacked with only five points in eight matches (and no goals and points in the last four games), Diego scored his first goal and provided his first assist of the Bundesliga season in Wolfsburg's 4–1 defeat of Fortuna Düsseldorf on 27 October 2012, which ended a run of four-straight defeats. Following the match, Diego stated that the club are enjoying their football again and he had given a chance under new interim manager Lorenz-Günther Köstner. Four days later, in the DFB-Pokal, Diego opened the scoring before providing an assist for Bas Dost as Wolfsburg defeated FSV Frankfurt 2–0. He then netted a brace in Wolfsburg's 3–1 victory over Bayer Leverkusen on 11 November, bringing to an end Bayer's 11-game unbeaten run and giving Wolfsburg their first home win of the Bundesliga campaign. Then, on 8 December 2012, Diego scored and set up the second and third goal in match in a 3–2 win over Borussia Dortmund. Throughout the 2012–13 season, Diego continued to make an impressive display for the club, scoring 10 goals in 37 appearance in all competitions, making him the club's top-scorer.\n\nBefore and during the 2013–14 Bundesliga season, Diego was linked with a move back to Santos in Brazil, as well as with English Premier League side Arsenal. Despite the rumours, Diego stayed with Wolfsburg for the first half of the season, scoring 3 times in 15 appearances. Throughout the first half of the season, however, Diego's future at Wolfsburg was uncertain after he disagreed with sporting director Klaus Allofs. At this time, Diego earned the highest wages at the club. The club was keen to extend Diego's contract.\n\nOn 31 January 2014, Diego moved back from Wolfsburg to Atlético Madrid. He signed a contract for the rest of the 2013–14 season. Prior the move, Diego desired to leave Wolfsburg in order to play in the Champions League.\n\nDiego debuted on 2 February on Atlético's victory 4–0 against Real Sociedad, scoring the match's fourth and final goal. On 1 April, Diego scored from a long-range shot against Barcelona in the Champions League, as Atlético reached the semi-finals for the first time since 1974. Atlético would reach the final of the Champions League for the second time since 1974, after beating Chelsea 3–1 to face their rivals Real Madrid in their first ever Madrid derby in the Champions League final. Unfortunately for him, Diego was an unused substitute in the final, as Atlético Madrid lost 4–1. Nevertheless, Diego helped the club win the La Liga championship to earn his team its first league title in 18 years.\n\nAfter being linked a move away, Diego wrote on his Instagram account, giving the Atlético supporters a farewell message, as he left the club for the second time.\n\nUpon his contract with Wolfsburg expiring at the end of the 2013–14 season, Diego was linked with a move to both Arsenal and Turkish Süper Lig side Fenerbahçe, and on 11 July 2014, Fenerbahçe confirmed a three-year deal after a medical. The next day, Diego was presented with the number 10 shirt.\n\nDiego made his Fenerbahçe debut in the opening game of the season, coming on as a substitute for Emmanuel Emenike in the 62nd minute, in a 3–2 win over Karabükspor. Diego continued to be in the first team by the first half of the season until he suffered a partial muscle tear during a 1–1 draw against Bursaspor on 24 November 2014. After being on the sidelined for three weeks, Diego made his first team return against Altınordu in the Groupstage of Turkish Cup, which he scored in a 1–1 draw on 23 December 2014. On 24 January 2015, Diego played a vital role when he provided two assist for Dirk Kuyt and Caner Erkin in a 3–0 win over Kasımpaşa on 24 January 2015. Diego's second goal then came four months later on 3 April 2015 in the quarter-final of Turkish Cup in a 2–1 win over Mersin İdmanyurdu. Soon after, Diego soon made complaint, claiming he had not been paid by the club. Diego scored his first league goal for the club in a 4–3 win over Balıkesirspor on 2 May 2015 after making his first team from the previous game as a substitute. This was followed up his second league goal seven days later, in a 3–2 win over Sivasspor. Diego's third goal later came in a 2–2 draw against İstanbul Başakşehir. In his first season at Fenerbahçe, Diego made 30 appearance and scored five goals in all competitions.\n\nAfter various failed attempts to sign Diego in previous years, Flamengo was finally able to hire the player for three years in 19 July 2016. The player, who had already expressed a wish of playing for a Brazilian club chose Flamengo over other rival clubs. The great moment lived by Rubro-Negro, in the Brazilian Série A, according Diego, resulted from \"complicity and generosity.\"\n\nDiego made an instant impact in Flamengo and quickly became the team's most important midfielder. He debuted in 21 August 2016 in a Brazilian Série A match against Grêmio scoring the winning goal with a header. He went on to score another goal in the next match, this time in a 3–1 win over Chapecoense on 28 August 2016.\n\nDiego made his international debut in April 2003 in a friendly match against Mexico. He was later included in Brazil under-23 team that competed in 2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup alongside Santos' teammate Robinho. Although Brazil compete as an under-23 team, the international appearances and goals were recorded as FIFA acknowledge the tournament as senior team matches. He appeared five times and scored two goals as Brazil U-23 lost out to the Mexico senior team in the final.\n\nIn 2004, Diego was called up for the Brazil national squad for the 2004 Copa América, and he was instrumental in securing the tournament victory for Brazil when he scored in the penalty shootout against Argentina in the final.\n\nHowever, due to his decline in performance with Porto between 2004 and 2006, he was often left out of the Brazil squad. He was mostly playing as deputy to Kaká and was also left out of the Brazil squad for the 2006 World Cup.\n\nHe was then included in Brazil's squad for the 2007 Copa América, which Brazil went on to win, once again defeating Argentina in the final.\n\nDiego also participated with Brazil U-23 team for 2008 Olympics in Beijing. Brazil went on to earn the bronze medal with a third-place finish in the tournament.\n\nOn 19 January 2017, he came back to Brazilian team being called up by coach Tite for a friendly game against Colombia, six days later. Only footballers playing for Brazilian clubs were called up.\nBrazil won the game 1–0.\n\nDiego is a creative offensive playmaker known for his technique, dribbling ability, vision and accurate passing; usually deployed as an attacking midfielder, he is also capable of playing as a supporting forward or on the wing on occasion. As well as being an effective assist provider, he is also known for his goalscoring ability, and he is an accurate set-piece taker. Diego is also known for his trickery and ball-skills, such as his use of back-heels, feints and overhead kicks, among an assortment of other tricks.\n\nDiego is of Italian ancestry, with both of his paternal great-grandparents emigrating from Italy to Brazil. His great-grandfather, Carlo Lazzari, came from Ferrara, and his great-grandmother, Maria Concetta Viola, came from Naples. As a result of his Italian ancestry, Diego received his Italian passport in 2004.\n\nDiego is married to Bruna Letícia Araújo, by whom he has two children; a son Davi (born in 2011) and another son Matteo (born in 2013).\n\nSantos\n\nPorto\n\nWerder Bremen\n\nAtlético Madrid\n\nFlamengo\n\nBrazil Youth\n\nBrazil\n\n\n"}

The old towns of Arenal and Tronadora now lie abandoned at the bottom of the lake, with the new town of Arenal existing to the northeast on the lake.\n\nLake Arenal was tripled in size with the construction of the Arenal dam in 1979, which exists at the eastern end of the lake. This hydroelectric project is hugely important to Costa Rica, initially generating 70% of the country's electricity, now closer to 17%, and was also a driving force behind Costa Rica's green energy policy.\n\nFish species in Lake Arenal include the machaca and the rainbow bass. There are also many species of plants, 120 mammals (including jaguar and tapir), and 300 birds (including quetzal).\n\nFrom November through April the strong, dependable winds attract windsurfers and kite surfers to its western end. Many consider Lake Arenal one of the world's foremost windsurfing and kite surfing areas. Wakeboarding is gaining popularity in Costa Rica, with Lake Arenal being the center of this activity. Stand up paddling and kayaking are also popular activities for tourists visiting the lake's Eastern part near the earthen dam. There is much good fishing (primarily for rainbow bass) and now kayak fishing opportunities in the shallow and secluded coves.

{"id": "2110282", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2110282", "title": "Spokane Garry", "text": "Spokane Garry\n\nSpokane Garry (sometimes spelled Spokan Garry) ( 1811 – 1892) was a Native American leader of the Middle Spokane tribe. He also acted as a liaison between white settlers and American Indian tribes in the area which is now eastern Washington state.\n\nThe future Spokane Garry (whose Spokan name was Slough-Keetcha) was born at the junction of the Spokane and the Little Spokane Rivers in or around 1811. He was the son of the tribal chief of the Middle Spokanes, whose name is given by various sources as Illum-Spokanee, Illim-Spokanee and Ileeum Spokanee.\n\nWhen white settlers arrived in the area in 1825, the boy was one of two chosen by the Hudson's Bay Company to be taught at an Anglican mission school at Fort Garry, Rupert's Land (now Winnipeg, Manitoba), which was run by the Missionary Society of the Church of England. Before he left for Manitoba, he was renamed \"Spokane Garry\" in honor of his tribe and the deputy governor of the Hudson's Bay Company, Nicholas Garry. His baptism on June 24, 1827 is said to be the first Protestant baptism of a non-white person west of the Rocky Mountains. He was accompanied by another boy known as Kootenais Pelly, who became Garry's closest friend at the school.\n\nThe students learned English at Fort Garry and were also taught new forms of survival skills. Garry enjoyed learning, but found adjusting to the new life difficult. One story relates that he was once disciplined for disobedience by being whipped with a switch while an older white student held him. Garry became afraid and clenched his teeth only to realize afterwards that he had bitten into the ear of the student holding him. The student waved off the inadvertent attack, leading Garry to realize for the first time that white settlers could be well-intentioned, but also that resistance to authority would likely be futile.\n\nChief Illim-Spokanee died in late 1828. When spring arrived, Garry and Pelly left the mission school and began the arduous trek back to the Spokane River so that Garry could assume the position of chief of his tribe.\n\nUpon their return to Spokane in the fall of 1829, Garry passed on what he had learned at Fort Garry to both his people and to the neighboring peoples of the Columbia Plateau. They returned to the mission the next spring, bringing five other students with them. In 1831 Garry was sent back to the West to notify the Kootenais of Pelly's death, which had taken place at Easter; instead of returning to the Red River afterwards as expected, however, he travelled on to Spokane and never returned.\n\nGarry spent much of the next few years preaching his simple Anglican faith in the Columbia Plateau and teaching his people methods of agriculture which he had picked up at the Red River settlement. He found that his new position within the tribal hierarchy created a stronger sense of duty to his people and a need to ensure their peaceful co-existence with white settlers. At this time he married a woman who he renamed Lucy.\n\nIn the 1840s the Spokanes were visited by a number of missionaries. Rev. Samuel Parker of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions was impressed by the piety of the peoples of the region, but other Protestant missionaries thought less highly of the Indians' typical activities, while Catholic missionaries were hostile to both. None were successful in converting the Spokanes to their denominations of Christianity. However, the missionaries' denunciation of Spokane Garry's simple but \"primitive\" faith was said to have lessened his reputation among the Christians and possibly among his people. His decision to take a second wife was also viewed negatively.\n\nIn the mid-1840s Garry joined the first Walla Walla expedition. While there, the party found themselves short of trading goods and went into the mountains to hunt for hides. A white man named Grove Cook killed a young Christian member of the party named Toayahnu, who was the son of Piupiumaksmaks the chief of the Walla Wallas. The apparent unwillingness of the Indian agent at Walla Walla, Elijah White, to prosecute the crime enraged the Indians; tensions worsened after the Whitman Massacre of 1847. Garry, a wealthy man by the standards of his tribe, attempted to keep the peace between the two groups.\n\nOn October 17, 1853, Garry met with Isaac Stevens, the newly appointed Governor of Washington Territory. Stevens later professed himself surprised that Garry could speak both English and French fluently, but also wrote that he found himself frustrated by Garry's unwillingness to speak frankly.\n\nTwo years later, Stevens summoned the Walla Walla, Nez Perce, Cayuse and Yakama tribes to negotiate a treaty, as well as asking Garry to attend as an observer. The chiefs agreed on a treaty and it seemed there would be peace, but soon the Yakama decided against allowing the whites to take their land and began to prepare for war against the United States. They recruited younger members of the Spokanes, but Garry was able to prevent his men from joining the impending battle. He could not stop the war, though, which began on September 23 with the deaths of several miners on the Yakima River and of A.J. Bolton, the special agent to the Yakamas.\n\nWhen Stevens heard that war had broken out, he went immediately to the Spokane village and demanded to speak to Garry. The chiefs of the Coeur d'Alenes, the Spokanes, and Colvilles, as well as the leaders of the local French Canadian community were also in attendance. Stevens promised friendship, but asked the Spokanes to decide immediately between signing a treaty that would hand most of their land over to the whites or declaring war against the United States. He said in part:\n\nGarry made an impassioned speech itemizing all the grievances the Indians had and their unwillingness to give up their ancestral lands for the benefit of the whites. Stevens, finding himself unable to win the argument, retreated, and the Spokanes kept their lands.\n\nIn the following years Garry worked to keep the peace between the Spokanes and white settlers. His attempts to negotiate a new treaty with the territorial government were ignored; Stevens instead encouraged the Spokanes to abandon their traditional lands and take up individual ownership under the Indian Homestead Act of 1862. The Spokanes did not receive a reservation under the terms of the treaty they finally signed in 1887.\n\nGarry continued teaching well into old age and advising his people until he allegedly gave into gambling and drinking. During his final years he spent much of his time living in his teepee on the Spokane River. He died in 1892.\n\nIn 1961 Dudley C. Carter created a carving of Garry on the site of St. Dunstan's Church of the Highlands in Shoreline, Washington in honor of a biography of Garry written by the then vicar of the congregation.\n\n\n"}

Tomislav Ivić eventually decided he should be the replacement for an ageing Fernando Gomes, and made his debuts with the first team at age 19, being crowned top scorer in the Primeira Liga in the 1995–96 season; previously, in 1990–91, he was involved in a last-matchday battle for the \"Bola de Prata\" award with S.L. Benfica's Rui Águas, with Águas' team having won the championship the game before: Domingos played first, putting four past Vitória de Guimarães in a 5–0 home win, going from 20 to 24 goals. Águas appeared hours later against S.C. Beira-Mar, and scored two second-half goals in an eventual 3–0 triumph, finishing with 25.\n\nFor 1997–98, Domingos moved to the Canary Islands' CD Tenerife, one year after Porto signed prolific striker Mário Jardel. There, he teamed up with Roy Makaay, but never fully adapted to La Liga, netting only once in his final season – which ended in relegation – in a 1–2 home loss to Deportivo Alavés.\n\nDomingos eventually returned to Porto two years later, who outbid Sporting Clube de Portugal at the eleventh hour. While cherished by the crowd, he did not impose himself as in the past, and retired at the end of the 2000–01. He won seven league titles, six supercups and five cups.\n\nFor Portugal, Domingos scored nine goals in 34 appearances, including one against Croatia at UEFA Euro 1996 as the national team reached the quarter-finals.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2110300", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2110300", "title": "D. A. Miller", "text": "D. A. Miller\n\nD. A. Miller (born 1948) is an American literary critic and film scholar. He is John F. Hotchkis Professor Emeritus and Professor of the Graduate School in the Department of English at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nHe received his PhD in Comparative Literature from Yale University in 1977 and taught comparative literature and English at UC Berkeley, Harvard University, and Columbia University before returning to UC Berkeley.\n\nMiller's work has been enormously influential in a wide range of fields in literary and cultural studies, including narrative theory, the history of the novel, film studies, and gay studies.\n\nIn his early work, Miller examined the cultural and ideological work of the nineteenth-century novel in English and French. Influenced by structuralism and centered on novels by Jane Austen, George Eliot and Stendhal, \"Narrative and Its Discontents: Problems of Closure in the Traditional Novel\" (1981) considered the novel form's fraught relationship to the social and ethical principles that it purports to convey. Miller argued that these closure-promoting principles belie the openness required by traditional narrative itself, defined as both “a quest after that which will end questing” and “an interruption of what will be resumed.”\n\nMiller's \"The Novel and the Police\" (1988) drew on the writing and teaching of Michel Foucault to consider the novel's setting to work as a technology of discipline. \"Disciplinary power,\" Miller wrote, \"constitutively mobilizes a tactic of tact: it is the policing power that never passes for such, but is either invisible or visible only under cover of other, nobler or simply blander intentionalities (to educate, to cure, to produce, to defend).\" Miller's book thus countered critical celebrations of the novel as inherently emancipatory. (Indeed, \"The Novel and the Police\" exposed these celebrations as \"perpetuating the [novel’s] ruse\".) Against this \"subversion hypothesis\", Miller called for attention to the novel's ability effectively to produce subjects, its capacity to form \"a subject habituated to psychic displacements, evacuations, reinvestments, in a social order whose totalizing power circulates all the more easily for being pulverized\".\n\nIn \"Anal Rope\"(1990), his definitive reading of Alfred Hitchcock’s 1948 film \"Rope\", and in his next books, \"Bringing Out Roland Barthes\" (1992) and \"Place for Us: Essay on the Broadway Musical\" (1998), Miller turned to more explicitly gay-themed works, even while insisting on the importance of the implicit in mainstream culture’s representations and disavowals of homosexuality.\n\n\"Anal Rope\" treated, among other things, the role of connotation in such representations and disavowals. Redressing film criticism’s refusal to acknowledge the homosexuality of Hitchcock’s protagonists (inspired by Leopold and Loeb), Miller argued that the celebrated technique that had been film critics’ exclusive and obsessive focus was informed by and inseparable from the threat posed by gay male sexuality. Like Miller's later essays on homosexuality and Hollywood cinema \"Visual Pleasure in 1959\" (1997) and \"On the Universality of Brokeback Mountain\" (2007), \"Anal Rope\" maintained that this threat was not marginal, but rather \"central\" to the making and maintenance of heterosexual identity. The critical reception of \"Rope\", like that of \"Suddenly, Last Summer\" and \"Brokeback Mountain\", allowed Miller to locate \"a homosexual closet constructed for heterosexual use, for the indulgence, in other words, of a homosexual fantasy that we must understand as not the peculiar coinage of the gay male brain, but the common, even central daydream of the normal world\" (\"Visual Pleasure in 1959\").\n\nAt once \"openly autobiographical\" and programmatically \"novelesque\", \"Bringing Out Roland Barthes\" responded to this fantasy in kind, with a fantasy of its own. Miller wrote that it \"had come to interest [him] to know that Barthes – or any man for that matter – was gay\" only because \"such information broached to fantasy the possibility of alleviating an erotic pessimism by producing with him, against him, a sexuality that had become ‘ours.’\" Miller’s tribute to Barthes thus anticipated \"Place for Us\" in its desire and determination to elaborate, without romanticizing, \"gay community\".\n\nSet in three differently communal spaces that were also \"hiding places\" – named in the chapter titles, \"In the Basement\", \"At the Bar\", and \"On Broadway\" – Miller's study of the Broadway musical further complicated the theory of the closet as \"Open Secret\" that Miller had first put forward in \"The Novel and the Police\" and had continued to unfold in \"Bringing Out Roland Barthes\". \"Place for Us\" shared \"The Novel and the Police\"s suspicion of emancipatory narratives and \"Bringing Out Roland Barthes\"s refusal of the politics of \"gay avowal\". The path of that Miller traced in \"Place for Us\", from the family basement to Broadway, thus entailed significant losses as well as gains. Against easy assimilationist pieties, Miller claimed that \"the featuring of homosexuals on the Broadway stage – even ones amicably drawn to our type – works positively against the recognition of homosexual desire that diffuses through ‘other’ subjects, objects, relations, all over the [musical] form. Indeed, by the contrary application of the same cruel logic, \"Gypsy\" and its closeted kind can now seem to have rendered a far richer account of this desire than anything we are likely to owe to a counter-tradition of gay avowal. After all, who that saw the closet at work on the musical stage, least of all ourselves, failed to witness this double operation: not only of ‘hiding’ homosexual desire, but also of manifesting, across all manner of landscapes, an extensive network of hiding places — call them latencies — apparently ready-made for the purpose? To perceive the closet was always also to perceive the multitude of conditions under which closeting was possible, to glimpse, even as it was being denied, the homosexual disposition of the world. No doubt we like La cage [aux folles] and its meager progeny even less for obliging us to admit, to our confusion, how keenly we miss this sublime vision, though it may have been the only truth that the closet's mendacity ever told.\"\n\nReturning to Austen in \"Austen’s Attitude\" (1995) and especially \"Jane Austen, or the Secret of Style\" (2003), Miller remained interested in the possibilities afforded by effacement. Noting that \"the realism of her works allows no one like Jane Austen to appear in them\", Miller argued that Austen's omniscient, disembodied and widely celebrated (successful) narrator emerges to compensate, if only partially, for the unmarried (and thus \"failed\") author's oppression by \"the conjugal imperative\": \"Behind the glory of style’s willed evacuation of substance lies the ignominy of a subject’s hopelessly insufficient social realization, just as behind style’s ahistorical impersonality lies the historical impasse of someone whose social representation doubles for social humiliation.\" \"For all along,\" Miller wrote later in \"Jane Austen\", \"shame has been style’s encrypted alter ego—its alternate form as ego—and style, the unremitting labor of managing and masking this encryption.\"\n\nQuestions of style and of its relationship to shame were also at the center of Miller's next book-length work, an essay on Federico Fellini's \"8½\". Framed as a response to critics’ complaints about Fellini's having (like his director-protagonist) \"nothing to say\" – complaints, that is, about the auteur's \"self-indulgence\" and the film's lack of substance and legible \"social engagement\" – Miller's \"8½\" contended that the film mapped out \"two ways\": \"In one direction lies the man, marked out by his fearful shortage of being and meaning; in the other lies style, which never acknowledges, unless it be to destroy, any order besides its own to which it is required to be sufficient. In the man, substance is inchoate, inadequate to the desired form; it is a drag on everything. In style, substance loses any such power of pressure, dissolving into a play of movement and light; marks of dishonor, feelings of shame, behaviors of abashment—these suddenly have no more pertinence than the rules of a schoolmarm in the Wild West, or the laws of a nation in a foreign embassy.\" These two ways formed, according to Miller, \"the basis for the social engagement that 8½ is not widely supposed to have\". Miller continued, \"The self-declared irresponsibility of Fellini’s style announces not a lapse to be deplored, but an intention to be understood. For every 'strong' style — I mean one, like Fellini’s, of blatantly insufficient substance — marks a refusal to come to terms with a world whose social organization it lets us perceive, in specific ways as intolerable. More: every such style mounts a positive offensive against this organization, an offensive that, if we choose to understand it, makes the familiar unmasking of style as \"denial\" look like a kind of denial itself.\"\n\nIn his typically dialectical (and inimitably stylish) way, Miller thus made the case for Fellini’s (Barthesian) \"nothing to say\", and for the continued relevance of \"8½\"’s programmatic irrelevance. For Miller, Fellini’s style, like Austen’s, capitalized on a condition of scarcity and turned blatant insufficiency to profit; this style combined negative refusal with \"positive offensive\" and derived strength from weakness.\n\nThroughout his career, Miller has been a committed, not to say peerless, practitioner of close reading, and in his recent studies of Austen and Hitchcock, including \"Hidden Hitchcock\" (2016), he has offered explicit defenses as well as models of that practice. But these defenses have been anything but triumphalist, and have instead sought to derive strength from weakness, or at least from untimeliness. As Miller writes in \"Jane Austen, or The Secret of Style\", close reading has long since fallen into disfavor, but this is not a fall to be straightforwardly lamented: \"it is close reading in its humbled, futile, ‘minoritized’ state that would win my preference in any contest. For only when close reading has lost its respectability, has ceased to be the slave of mere convenience, can it come out as a thing that, even under the high-minded (but now kitchy-sounding) rationales of its former mission, it had always been: an almost infantile desire to be close period, as close as one can get, without literal plagiarism, to merging with the mother-text. (In an essay once, citing the first sentence of Pride and Prejudice, I left out the quotation marks.)\" Miller’s parenthesis marks his love for and affinity with Austen, and his references to \"the mother-text\" and a coming out into \"infantile desire\" call Miller's Barthes to memory: \"far from having the sense to be ashamed of his prolonged dependency\", this critic \"shares with, say, the clone whose much different body is devoted to signaling its various sexual availabilities this common refusal: of the desirability, even the possibility, of the male body’s autonomy\" (\"Bringing Out Roland Barthes\"). Likewise, for Miller, \"[t]he adept in close reading must assert an autonomy of which he must also continually betray the weak and easily overwhelmed defenses.\" Closely linked to intimacy, Miller's close reading in this way implies an ethics and even a politics.\nBooks\n\nEssays\n\n"}

Born in Saint Michael and raised in Bridgetown, Barbados, Rihanna moved to the US in 2005 when she signed with Def Jam. She earned significant recognition following the release of her first two studio albums, \"Music of the Sun\" (2005) and \"A Girl like Me\" (2006), both of which were influenced by Caribbean music and peaked within the top ten of the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart.\n\nRihanna's third album, \"Good Girl Gone Bad\" (2007), which incorporated elements of dance-pop, catapulted her to greater stardom, establishing her status as a sex symbol and a leading figure in the music industry. Its international chart-topping single \"Umbrella\" earned Rihanna her first Grammy Award, winning Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. Rihanna extended her fusion of pop, dance, and R&B on her next four albums, \"Rated R\" (2009), \"Loud\" (2010), \"Talk That Talk\" (2011), and the Grammy Award-winning \"Unapologetic\" (2012). All four releases incorporated experimentation of various musical styles and consolidated Rihanna's international chart success, \"Unapologetic\" being her first number-one album in the US. The records spawned a string of chart-topping singles, including \"Rude Boy\", \"Only Girl (In the World)\", \"What's My Name?\", \"S&M\", \"We Found Love\", \"Diamonds\", and \"Stay\". Her eighth album, \"Anti\" (2016), showcased her control over artistic creativity after her departure from Def Jam. It became her second US number-one album and featured the chart-topping single \"Work\". Besides solo material, Rihanna has collaborated with recording artists such as Drake, Eminem, and Calvin Harris.\n\nHaving sold over 250 million records, Rihanna is one of the world's best-selling music artists. She has earned 14 number-one singles, 31 top-ten singles in the US, and 30 top-ten entries in the UK. Her accolades include nine Grammy Awards, 13 American Music Awards, 12 \"Billboard\" Music Awards, and six \"Guinness World Records\". \"Forbes\" ranked her among the top ten highest-paid celebrities in 2012 and 2014; as of 2019, she is the wealthiest female musician with an estimated net worth of $600 million. \"Time\" named her as one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2012 and 2018. Alongside a successful music career, Rihanna is well known for her involvement in humanitarian causes, entrepreneurial ventures, and the fashion industry. She is the founder of the nonprofit organization Clara Lionel Foundation, cosmetics brand Fenty Beauty, and fashion house Fenty under LVMH. In 2018, the Government of Barbados appointed her as an ambassador with duties promoting education, tourism, and investment.\n\nRobyn Rihanna Fenty was born on February 20, 1988 in Saint Michael, Barbados, the daughter of accountant Monica (née Braithwaite) and warehouse supervisor Ronald Fenty. Rihanna has two brothers, Rorrey and Rajad Fenty, and two half-sisters and a half-brother from her father's side, each born to different mothers from his previous relationships. She grew up in a three-bedroom bungalow in Bridgetown and sold clothes with her father in a stall on the street. Her childhood was deeply affected by her father's alcoholism and crack cocaine addiction, which contributed to her parents' strained marriage. Rihanna's father used to physically abuse her mother and she would try to get in between them to break up fights.\n\nAs a child, Rihanna had many CT scans for the excruciating headaches she suffered, recalling, \"The doctors even thought it was a tumor, because it was that intense.\" By the time she was 14, her parents had divorced and her health began to improve. She grew up listening to reggae music. She attended Charles F. Broome Memorial Primary School and Combermere School, where she studied alongside future international cricketers Chris Jordan and Carlos Brathwaite. Rihanna was an army cadet in a sub-military programme, where the later Barbadian singer-songwriter Shontelle was her drill sergeant. Although she initially wanted to graduate from high school, she chose to pursue a musical career instead.\n\nIn 2003, Rihanna formed a musical trio with two of her classmates. She was discovered in her home country of Barbados by American record producer Evan Rogers. Without a name or any material, the girl group managed to land an audition with Rogers who commented, \"The minute Rihanna walked into the room, it was like the other two girls didn't exist.\" Rihanna went to Rogers's hotel room, where she performed renditions of Destiny's Child's \"Emotion\" and Mariah Carey's \"Hero\". Impressed, Rogers scheduled a second meeting with Rihanna's mother present and then invited Rihanna to his hometown in the United States to record some demo tapes that could be sent to record labels. Recordings were intermittent, taking about a year, because she was only able to record during school holidays. \"Pon de Replay\" and \"The Last Time\" were two tracks recorded for the demo tape, which were eventually included on her debut album \"Music of the Sun\". That same year, Rihanna was signed to Rogers's and Carl Sturken's production company, Syndicated Rhythm Productions.\n\nRihanna's demo was shipped out to Def Jam Recordings, where Jay Brown, an A&R executive at the record label, was one of the first to hear the demo. Brown played the demo tape for rapper Jay-Z, who had recently been appointed as president and CEO of Def Jam. When Jay-Z first heard the track \"Pon de Replay\", he felt the song was too big for her. Despite being skeptical, he invited Rihanna to audition for the label. In early 2005, Rihanna auditioned for Def Jam in New York City, where Jay-Z introduced her to music mogul Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid. At the audition, she sang Whitney Houston's cover of \"For the Love of You\", as well as the demo tracks \"Pon de Replay\" and \"The Last Time\". Jay-Z was absolutely certain about signing her after she performed her future hit single \"Pon de Replay\". His boss, L.A. Reid, was also impressed with her audition, telling Jay-Z not to let Rihanna leave the building until the contract was signed. Reid left it to Jay-Z and his team to close the deal which resulted in a six-album record deal with Def Jam. She waited in Jay-Z's office until 3:00 in the morning to get lawyers to draft up a contract because he wanted to prevent her from signing with another label.\nRihanna canceled other meetings with record labels and relocated from Barbados to the United States to live with Rogers and his wife.\nAfter signing with Def Jam, Jay-Z and his team did the A&R for Rihanna's debut album and spent the next three months recording and completing her debut album. She worked with different producers to complete her debut studio album, primarily Rogers and his production partner Carl Sturken. With several songs to pick as a lead single, \"Pon de Replay\" was chosen because it seemed like the best song suited for a summer release. In May 2005, her debut single, \"Pon de Replay\", was released under her mononym \"Rihanna\". It charted successfully worldwide, peaking in the top five in fifteen countries, including at No. 2 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart and the UK Singles Chart. The song became a club hit in the United States, peaking at No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" Dance Club Songs.\n\n\"Music of the Sun\" was released in August 2005. It debuted at No. 10 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and received a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of over 500,000 units. The album sold over 2 million copies worldwide. A second single, \"If It's Lovin' that You Want\", was not as successful as its predecessor, but reached the top 10 in Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.\nAside from her work in music, Rihanna made her acting debut in a cameo role in the successful straight-to-DVD film \"\", released in August 2006.\n\nA month after the release of her debut album, Rihanna began working on her second studio album. \"A Girl like Me\" was released in April 2006. \"Rolling Stone\" felt that \"the burning rock guitar\" and haunted strings of some of the album's tracks made \"\"A Girl like Me\" [...] likable.\" The album was a commercial success, charting in the top 10 in 13 countries. The album reached No. 1 in Canada and No. 5 in the United Kingdom and the United States, where it sold 115,000 copies in its first week. The album became Rihanna's first to be certified Platinum by the RIAA, after selling over 1,000,000 units. Its lead single, \"SOS\", was an international success, charting in the top five in 11 countries. The song reached No. 1 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and in Australia, her first to reach this chart position. \"Unfaithful\", the album's second single, reached the top 10 in 18 countries, including No. 1 in Canada and Switzerland. Two more singles were released from the album: \"We Ride\" and \"Break It Off\".\n\nIn early 2007, Rihanna appeared on the single \"Roll It\" with Jamaican band J-Status and fellow Barbadian singer-songwriter Shontelle. The song appeared on J-Status' debut album \"The Beginning\", released in several European countries only. Around that time, Rihanna had already begun work on her third studio album, \"Good Girl Gone Bad\". With the help of producers Timbaland, Tricky Stewart and Sean Garrett she embraced a new musical direction through uptempo dance tracks. Released in May 2007, the album charted at No. 2 in Australia and the US and topped the charts in multiple countries, including Brazil, Canada, Ireland and the UK. The album received the most positive critical reviews of her first three albums.\nThe lead single, \"Umbrella\", topped the charts in 13 countries and remained at No. 1 in the UK for 10 consecutive weeks, the longest-running No. 1 single there since Wet Wet Wet's single \"Love Is All Around\" spent 15 weeks at the top in 1994. It was Rihanna's first single to be named one of the best-selling singles worldwide, with sales of over 8 million copies. The songs \"Shut Up and Drive\", \"Hate That I Love You\" (featuring Ne-Yo) and \"Don't Stop the Music\" were also released as singles, with the latter becoming an international hit. In support of the album, Rihanna began the Good Girl Gone Bad Tour in September 2007, with 80 shows across the US, Canada and Europe. Rihanna was nominated for several 2008 Grammy Awards for \"Good Girl Gone Bad\", winning Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for \"Umbrella\" alongside Jay-Z, her first Grammy Award.\n\nOn June 9, 2008, Rihanna released \"Good Girl Gone Bad Live\", her first live long-form video. The DVD and Blu-ray release featured Rihanna's concert at the Manchester Arena in Manchester, United Kingdom, held on December 6, 2007 as part of the Good Girl Gone Bad Tour. The release also contained a special documentary that presented Rihanna discussing her experiences during the tour. By late 2008, Rihanna still remained on the charts with the release of the fifth single from \"Good Girl Gone Bad\", \"Rehab\", and was named \"Diva of the Year\" by \"Entertainment Weekly\" for her \"newfound staying power\". \"Good Girl Gone Bad\" has sold over 2.8 million units in the United States alone, receiving a two-times-Platinum certification from the RIAA. It is Rihanna's best-selling album in the country to date. The album has sold 9 million units worldwide.\n\nDuring the late 2000s, Rihanna experimented further with pop, dubstep and rock music, officially shifting her musical style and image away from the Barbados island girl. Throughout 2008, Rihanna performed on the Glow in the Dark Tour alongside Kanye West, Lupe Fiasco and N.E.R.D. Her third studio album's reissue, \"\", was released in June 2008 with three new songs: \"Disturbia\", \"Take a Bow\" and the Maroon 5 duet \"If I Never See Your Face Again\", plus a Spanglish version of \"Hate That I Love You\" featuring Spanish pop singer David Bisbal. All four were released as singles and charted highly, reaching peak positions worldwide. In August 2008, Rihanna and a host of other female singers recorded the charity single \"Just Stand Up!\", the theme song to the anti-cancer campaign Stand Up to Cancer. \"Live Your Life\", a duet between T.I. and Rihanna, was released that November and topped the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n\nOn February 8, 2009, Rihanna's scheduled performance at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards was cancelled.\nReports surfaced that then-boyfriend, singer Chris Brown, had physically assaulted her. He was arrested on suspicion of making criminal threats. On March 5, 2009, Brown was charged with assault and for making criminal threats. A leaked photograph from the police department obtained by TMZ.com revealed that Rihanna had sustained visible injuries.\nA few months after the incident, Rihanna was featured on the single \"Run This Town\" by Jay-Z, which also featured Kanye West and was released as the second single from Jay-Z's 11th studio album \"The Blueprint 3\".\n\nIn early 2009, Rihanna began working on her fourth studio album, \"Rated R\". \"Rated R\" was released in November 2009. The album had \"Rolling Stone\" magazine stating that Rihanna \"transformed her sound and made one of the best pop records of the year\".\n\"Rated R\" featured a darker and more foreboding tone than Rihanna's previous albums.\n\"Rated R\" debuted at No. 4 on the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart.\nThe album was supported by six singles, including \"Rude Boy\", which was the biggest worldwide success from the album, topping the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for six weeks and reaching top 10 positions in 22 other countries.\nIn January 2010, Rihanna released her charity cover version of \"Redemption Song\" for the campaign. She also recorded the song \"Stranded (Haiti Mon Amour)\" together with Jay-Z, Bono and The Edge for the same campaign to alleviate the 2010 Haiti earthquake.\n\nIn summer 2010, Rihanna collaborated with rapper Eminem on \"Love the Way You Lie\", which was a major worldwide success, reaching No. 1 in over 20 countries. Reaching number 2, the song became the biggest-selling song of 2010 in the UK and the first of Rihanna's singles to sell over a million copies in the country. In October 2010, Rihanna switched managers, joining Jay-Z's Roc Nation Management. In late 2010, she was featured on three singles: Kanye West's \"All of the Lights\", from the album \"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\" (2010), Nicki Minaj's \"Fly\", from her debut studio album \"Pink Friday\" (2010) and David Guetta's \"Who's That Chick?\", from the album \"One More Love\" (2010).\n\"Loud\", Rihanna's fifth studio album, was released in November 2010. \nThe album produced three US Billboard Hot 100s. Its lead single, \"Only Girl (In the World)\", \"What's My Name?\", featuring rapper Drake and \"S&M\", following the release of its official remix featuring Britney Spears. Rihanna set a record as the solo artist with the fastest accumulation of 10 chart toppers in the Hot 100s history. At the 53rd Grammy Awards, \"Only Girl (In the World)\" won the award for Best Dance Recording.\n\n\"Man Down\" and \"California King Bed\" were released as singles in May 2011 with moderate success. \"Cheers (Drink to That)\", which interpolates Avril Lavigne's 2002 single \"I'm with You\", was released as the seventh and final single from the album. To promote the album, Rihanna embarked on her Loud Tour in June 2011, which sold out 10 nights at The O Arena in London, the most sold-out shows for a female artist in the venue's history. The tour was the seventh highest-grossing tour worldwide of 2011.\n\nRihanna's sixth album, \"Talk That Talk\", was released in November 2011. The album debuted at No. 3 in the U.S and number No. 1 in the UK The album's lead single, \"We Found Love\", topped charts in twenty-seven countries, peaked in the top 10 in 30 countries and broke many chart records worldwide. The single topped the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for 10 non-consecutive weeks, becoming Rihanna's longest-running No. 1 single on the chart and the longest-running No. 1 single of 2011 in the US. The song was later named the 24th biggest hit of all time on the \"Billboard \"Hot 100. \"You Da One\" and the album's title track, featuring Jay-Z, were released as the second and third singles, to moderate success. \"Where Have You Been\", the fifth single, successfully charted worldwide, reaching No. 5 in the US and No. 6 in the UK. \"Cockiness (Love It)\" was released as the album's sixth and final single in a remixed form featuring rapper ASAP Rocky.\n\nIn early 2012, two collaborations featuring Rihanna were released: Coldplay's \"Princess of China\", from their album \"Mylo Xyloto\", and Drake's \"Take Care\", from his album of the same name. In February 2012, Rihanna won her third Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 2012 Grammy Awards for her Kanye West collaboration \"All of the Lights\" and was voted the Best International Female Solo Artist at the 2012 BRIT Awards for the second consecutive year. March 2012 saw the simultaneous releases of two collaborations between Rihanna and Chris Brown: remixes of her song \"Birthday Cake\" and his \"Turn Up the Music\". The recordings received mainly negative responses due to the pair's history of domestic violence. In September 2012, \"We Found Love\" won the MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year, making Rihanna the first woman to receive the accolade more than once.\nRihanna's seventh studio album, \"Unapologetic\", was released in November 2012. In the United States, the album debuted at No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" 200 albums chart, marking Rihanna's first No. 1 album in the country.

Following the release of \"Unapologetic\" and its accompanying tour, Rihanna aimed to take a hiatus from recording music, stating: \"I wanted to have a year to just do whatever I want artistically, creatively.\" In May 2014, Rihanna left Def Jam Recordings to sign fully with Roc Nation, the record label that had managed her career since October 2010.\n\nA year after Rihanna began working on her eighth studio album, the single \"FourFiveSeconds\" was released, which featured Rihanna paired up with Kanye West and Paul McCartney. Two further singles followed its release: \"Bitch Better Have My Money\" and \"American Oxygen\"; neither made the final track listing for Rihanna's eighth studio album.

Further Platinum-certified singles \"Needed Me\" and \"Love on the Brain\" both peaked inside the top 10 of the US Hot 100.\n\nIn 2016, Rihanna was featured on several singles. The first collaboration single was Kanye West's \"Famous\", where Rihanna provided uncredited guest vocals. She was then officially featured on Calvin Harris' \"This Is What You Came For\", which was a success. Rihanna was also featured on Drake's \"Too Good\" and on Mike Will Made Its \"Nothing Is Promised\". In June 2016, Rihanna released \"Sledgehammer\", a single from the \"Star Trek Beyond\" movie soundtrack. On August 28, 2016, Rihanna was honored with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards after performing various medleys of her hit songs.\n\nRihanna released several collaborations in 2017. First she was the featured part in Future's \"Selfish\", the lead single from the rapper's sixth studio album, \"Hndrxx\". Summer 2017 saw the release of Rihanna's collaborations with record producer DJ Khaled, \"Wild Thoughts\", which also featured Bryson Tiller and was a worldwide success, and Kendrick Lamar's single, \"Loyalty\", which earned Rihanna her ninth Grammy Award at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards. In November 2017, Rihanna was part of N.E.R.Ds comeback single \"Lemon\" from the band's album \"No One Ever Really Dies\".\n\nIn October 2017, Shakka revealed that he was working with Rihanna on her \"absolutely insane\" album. In December 2018, Rihanna confirmed that the album would be released in 2019, and later announced that it is a reggae project. In August 2019, fans noticed that Rihanna and co-songwriters Collin Edwards, Monique Lawrence, and Alexander Ogunmokun registered a song titled \"Private Loving\" with the music publishing organization BMI. In September 2019, it was announced she had signed with Sony/ATV Music Publishing. In December 2019, Rihanna alluded to her album being complete and indefinitely withholding the release date in an Instagram post. She was next featured on Canadian singer PartyNextDoor's song \"Believe It\", which was released on March 27, 2020.\n\nRihanna is a mezzo-soprano, with a range spanning from B to C#. While recording tracks for her third studio album, \"Good Girl Gone Bad\" (2007), Rihanna took vocal lessons from Ne-Yo. Speaking of the experience she stated, \"I've never had vocal training, so when I'm in the studio, he'll tell me how to breathe and stuff... He'll call out these big fancy words: 'OK, I want you to do staccato.' And I'm like, 'OK, I don't know what that is.'\" Her vocal performance on \"Loud\" (2010) received positive reviews from music critics. James Skinner from BBC praised Rihanna's vocals on the song \"Love the Way You Lie (Part II)\" and wrote that her voice is powerful and that \"it is Rihanna's vocal – at once commanding, soulful and vulnerable – that anchors the song, and Loud itself\". Andy Gill from \"The Independent\" feels that \"California King Bed\" features her best vocal performance. In a review of \"Unapologetic\", \"Billboard\" magazine wrote, \"Diamonds finds Rihanna doing one of her throatiest, most impassioned vocals to date, on this inspirational pop ballad.\" Jon Caramanica of the \"New York Times\" stated, \"over the years, as her game face froze in place, her voice cured into a weapon of emotional chill and strategic indifference. It's decidedly unfriendly, made to give orders\".\nGrowing up in Barbados, she was not exposed to a variety music, mainly reggae, hip-hop and soca music. When she moved to the United States, she was exposed to varieties of American music \"rock being one of them, and I fell in love with it. [Now] I love rock music.\" At the time of her debut, she recorded songs that were inspired by her Caribbean roots and described her early sound as \"a fusion of reggae, hip-hop and R&B, with a little something different thrown in\". Her early dancehall roots can be found on her debut album, \"Music of the Sun\" (2005), and its follow-up, \"A Girl like Me\" (2006). \"Music of the Sun\" demonstrates the influence of Rihanna's musical heritage of the Caribbean. Kelefa Sanneh of the \"New York Times\" complimented its combination of dancehall and reggae, who said, \"Dancehall reggae sometimes seems like a furiously insular form of music, but ... Rihanna is only the latest singer to discover how versatile the genre's spring-loaded electronic rhythms can be\". Her debut single, \"Pon de Replay\" features a dancehall-pop mixture that infuses a reggae style, while \"If It's Lovin' that You Want\" talks about a girl seducing a guy to be her boyfriend. Aiming for artistic growth, \"A Girl like Me\" expresses personal experiences that typical 18-year-old girls go through with ballads that were described as elegant and mature. After her second album, she slowly dismissed her dancehall and reggae roots.\n\nRihanna's music has incorporated a wide range of genres including, pop, R&B, reggae, dubstep, hip hop and EDM. With its provocative subject matter and lyrics, her musical career has been an experiment with new musical ideas and stated that she wants \"to make music that could be heard in parts of the world that I'd never been to\". During a review for \"Good Girl Gone Bad\" (2007), \"Slant Magazine\" to write that Rihanna \"finally figured out that she's a dance artist and the majority of the album is uptempo dance-pop [songs like]\" \"Push Up on Me\" and \"Don't Stop the Music\". It represents a departure from the Caribbean sound of her previous albums and is described as a turning point in her career. While the first half of the record shares many 1980s pop influences with songs like \"Don't Stop the Music\" and \"Shut Up and Drive\", the second half retreats into standard R&B.\n\nRecorded after the assault by her then-boyfriend, Chris Brown, \"Rated R\" (2009) had a much darker tone and was filled with various emotions she experienced throughout 2009. In \"Loud\" (2010), Rihanna reflects on the fun and energetic vibe she had while recording the album. The album is a mixture of ballads, party anthems and empowering love songs. \"Talk That Talk\" (2011) was similar to \"Rated R\", as both contain hip hop, R&B, dancehall and dubstep genres. \"Loud\" and \"Talk That Talk\" saw her explore sexuality in her work (\"S&M\" and \"Birthday Cake\") and return to her dancehall roots (\"Man Down\" and \"Watch n' Learn\"). She also branched out into house music with tracks like \"We Found Love\", \"Only Girl (In the World)\" and \"Complicated.\" Her songs are also inspired through record sampling from other artists.\n\nRihanna has named Madonna as her idol and biggest influence. She said that she wanted to be the \"black Madonna\" and praised the singer for being able to constantly reinvent herself successfully throughout her career. She noted, \"I think that Madonna was a great inspiration for me, especially on my earlier work. If I had to examine her evolution through time, I think she reinvented her clothing style and music with success every single time. And at the same time remained a real force in entertainment in the whole world.\"\nAnother major influence on Rihanna's music and career has been Mariah Carey, whose song \"Hero\" she performed when Rihanna was still a teenager at her high school talent show. She revealed that Carey's song \"Vision of Love\" \"was the song that made [her] want to do music.\"\n\nIn her youth, she would see Bob Marley on television because of his fame in the Caribbean. She stated, \"He's one of my favourite artists of all time – he really paved the way for every other artist out of the Caribbean\". She built a shrine in her home dedicated to the reggae legend and has covered Marley's \"Is This Love\" and Bob Marley & The Wailers' \"Redemption Song\" during her concert tours.\nDuring her childhood, she would go around singing Whitney Houston songs and \"A Whole New World\" into her hairbrush so much that her neighbors started calling her \"Robyn Redbreast\". She also stated that one of the first songs she remembers falling in love with was Houston's version of \"I Will Always Love You\" and that it \"was really inspiring, and it made me develop a passion for music, so really, she's partly responsible for me being here in this industry.\"\n\nRihanna was also influenced by Janet Jackson, Aaliyah, Beyoncé and Destiny's Child. Other musical influences and idols include Celine Dion, Grace Jones, Lil' Kim, Alicia Keys, Prince, Fefe Dobson, and Brandy. Rihanna takes influence from the different types of music she discovered when she came to America and revealed that rock music was one of the first genres she fell in love with. She commented, \"as I grow older, I want to know more about music. I want to discover more types of music\". She cited Brandy's fourth studio album, \"Afrodisiac\" (2004), as her main inspiration for her third album, \"Good Girl Gone Bad\" (2007). In her early career, her music contained strong influences of Caribbean music, including reggae and dancehall. The music video of the song \"Rude Boy\" featured images inspired by her Caribbean roots.\n\nRihanna has worked with music video director Anthony Mandler on more than a dozen music videos, the first being \"Unfaithful\" (2006). \"We've done 16 videos together; they're not all tough, [...] Yeah, I mean, I'm known for the 'Disturbia's and the 'Russian Roulette's and things like that, but 'Only Girl (In the World)' is certainly an ethereal kind of empowering, beauty-filled video,\" Mandler said. Jocelyn Vena of MTV wrote, \"Rihanna, like Madonna, also has a tendency to make truly thought-provoking music videos that fit the songs they represent. Smattered in between glitzier, more glamorous clips, Madge and Ri want us to think about bigger issues\". Jon Bream of the \"Star Tribune\" commented \"[i]n the tradition of Madonna and Janet Jackson, Rihanna has become the video vixen of the '00s ... Rihanna has perfected the pout, the long-legged strut and trend-setting hairdos that keep women and men alike checking her out on YouTube.\" George Epaminondas of \"InStyle\" considers Rihanna's music videos to be \"cinematic\" due to her \"blend of lush island rhythms and swinging pop and ... mischievous sensuality.\"\nMany of her music videos were shot as short films exploring issues such as love triangles, abuse and substance abuse romance, including \"We Found Love\" and \"Man Down\". Her music video for \"Umbrella\" shows Rihanna's transition into adulthood and her newly adopted image. The \"dark, creepy\" scenes of \"Disturbia\" have been compared to \"Michael Jackson's Thriller\". The video for \"Russian Roulette\" features Rihanna in a padded room playing a game of russian roulette with her partner. A scene of Rihanna being approached by a speeding car at night was compared to the altercation with Chris Brown. \nIn 2011, Rihanna released three controversial music videos about sadomasochism, rape and domestic violence. \"Man Down\", which features Rihanna shooting a man in a train station, was criticized by the Parents Television Council. \"We Found Love\", which shows Rihanna and her love interest in a drug-filled unhealthy relationship, sparked criticism from the Rape Crisis Centre for its inappropriate message. But Charne Graham of the \"Houston Press\" defended the singer, asking, \"Why should Rihanna's music videos get everyone riled up when others' equally sexual and controversial videos are in rotation? [...] she just like[s] to make music videos that give us something to talk about.\" She is the first woman to pass 2 billion cumulative views on the music video website Vevo. As of December 2016, she has accumulated over 10 billion views on the site.\n\nDenis Armstrong of Canadian Online Explorer commented on her performance at the Ottawa Bluesfest, saying \"her show was a Disney-esque choreographed fantasy of non-stop hip-swiveling, sassy attitude and personal endearments and a string of funky, sugar-free hits.\" Her performance of \"Disturbia\" at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards was ranked tenth best on the MTV Video Music Awards, according to a \"Billboard\" poll. Her revealing leather costumes during her Good Girl Gone Bad Tour were highly criticized by Malaysia's conservative Islamic party, who recommended that her concert tour should be banned. Whilst commenting on her third album's accompanying tour, \"The Times\" compared Rihanna's stage wardrobe styling to that of Janet Jackson and called her \"a vision of Ann Summers couture in thigh-high boots and a few scraps of black PVC.\" In the October 2011 issue of \"British Vogue\", Rihanna said her performance outfits and appearances are all an act; \"[t]hat's not me. That's a part I play. You know, like it's a piece of art, with all these toys and textures to play with\".\n\nKnown for reinventing her style and image, Rihanna's music and fashion sense are noted by the media. In 2009, \"New York\" magazine described Rihanna's early look as that of \"a cookie-cutter teen queen\", noting she has the ability \"to shift looks dramatically and with such ease\". Around the time of the release of her second studio album, \"A Girl like Me\" (2006), many critics felt that Rihanna's style, sound and musical material were too similar to those of Beyoncé. In an interview with \"Look\" magazine, Rihanna spoke about comparisons to Beyoncé: \"Beyoncé is a great artist and I feel honored to be mentioned in the same sentence, but we're different performers with different styles\". She revealed during \"Oprah's Next Chapter\" that Def Jam's pop-princess blueprint made her feel claustrophobic during her early years with the label. According to Rihanna, \"I felt like they were giving me a blueprint. [...] They had a brand, they had an idea of what they wanted me to be without figuring out who I was.\" With the release of her third album, \"Good Girl Gone Bad\" (2007), Rihanna dismissed her innocent image for an edgier look with a new hairstyle, which was inspired by Charlize Theron's bob cut in the science fiction thriller \"Æon Flux\" (2005). She followed the likes of recording artists Janet Jackson and Christina Aguilera who also shed their innocent image for an edgier look and sound.\nNico Amarca of \"Highsnobiety\" magazine wrote \"over the course of her now 10-year career, [Rihanna] has undergone one of the most significant aesthetic metamorphoses the world has ever seen\". Her image and fashion has changed several times with different hairstyles since the release of her third album. She commented that as a child she \"used to watch her [mother] get dressed\" and that her love and admiration for fashion started with her mom. When putting together her own wardrobe she stated, \"It's become more about taking a risk ... I always look for the most interesting silhouette or something that's a little off.\" Jess Cartner-Morley of \"The Guardian\" wrote that \"Rihanna's wardrobe is the most talked-about, influential and dissected in pop right now\" and that whatever she wears \"is immediately reproduced on the high street, because it sells\". Country singer Miranda Lambert admires Rihanna's fashion and style stating, \"I don't necessarily get inspired by the whole no-bra thing, but I love that you never know what she's going to wear. It always keeps you guessing, which makes her sassy and interesting.\"\n\nIn an interview with Alexa Chung during \"Vogue\" Festival 2015, Balmain designer Olivier Rousteing praised Rihanna by stylistically comparing her to some of the biggest fashion icons in music history, such as Madonna, David Bowie, Michael Jackson and Prince. Commenting on the cultural expectation for pop stars to be role models, she said \"[being a role model] became more of my job than I wanted it to be. But no, I just want to make music. That's it\". In a May 2013 interview with MTV, \"The Vagina Monologues\" writer and feminist Eve Ensler praised the singer, saying, \"I'm a huge Rihanna fan, I think she has a kind of agency over her sexuality and she's open about her sexuality, she has enormous grace and she's immensely talented.\"\nDescribed as one of the sexiest women of her generation, she revealed that being a sex symbol is not a priority and that \"it's definitely flattering, but also uncomfortable.\" Her appearance has landed her on the cover of magazines such as \"Maxim\", \"FHM\", \"Rolling Stone\", and in December 2012, Rihanna became the first woman to be featured on the cover of \"GQ\" magazine's \"Men of the Year\" issue.\n\nRihanna made her first appearance at the Met Gala in 2007. She has made eight appearances in the years since; notably in 2015, for , her Guo Pei-designed yellow dress garnered the most attention of the event, accruing a billion impressions on social media. The dress, which had taken two years to make before Rihanna came across it, became the subject of a documentary by Pietra Brettkelly, entitled \"Yellow Is Forbidden\".\nShe co-chaired the 2018 \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination\" themed event, wearing Maison Margiela.\n\nRihanna is recognized by the media as a pop and fashion icon, particularly since her third studio album \"Good Girl Gone Bad\" (2007). Nick Levine of \"Digital Spy\" described \"Good Girl Gone Bad\" as \"the closest thing to a \"Thriller\" that 2007/08 is likely to produce\". Her single \"Umbrella\", famous for its \"ella ella\" hook, is considered by \"Rolling Stone\" to be one of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. Her 2011 single \"We Found Love\" was ranked by \"Billboard\" as the 24th biggest US \"Billboard \"Hot 100 hit of all time. Rihanna's eighth studio album \"Anti\" (2016) and its lead single \"Work\" has been credited by a \"Billboard\" editor for bringing the dancehall genre to the forefront of mainstream American music. Music critic Jayson Greene of \"Pitchfork\" described Rihanna as the most influential singer of the past decade, writing:\"Rihanna Voice has become an industry-wide idea, a creative property like the Korg synth or LinnDrum […] We crave the thrill that you can only get when a dozen or so good ideas manifest themselves in a single voice. For the past 10 years, that voice has more or less been Rihanna's. Now that she's gleefully shredding it apart, she'll probably generate a whole new comet trail of Rihannabes. Inevitably, none of them will carry the charge, the glassy cool and subterranean heat, of the real thing.\" \n\n\"Time\" magazine included Rihanna on its 100 Most Influential People in the World issue in 2012 and 2018, with Stella McCartney writing: \"She's one of the coolest, hottest, most talented, most liked, most listened to, most followed, most impressive artists at work today, but she does it in her own stride. She works hard, very hard. She gives to her fans, friends and foundation not just herself but her energy and spirit.\" On June 2, 2014, Rihanna was presented with Fashion Icon lifetime achievement award from Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA), a special prize reserved for \"an individual whose style has made a significant impact on popular culture on an international stage\".

In a January 2013 interview with \"Rolling Stone\", Rihanna confirmed that she had rekindled her relationship with Chris Brown, though he remained under probation for the 2009 domestic violence incident. The confirmation followed persistent media speculation throughout 2013 regarding the pair's reunion. In a May 2013 interview, Brown stated that he and Rihanna had broken up again. Rihanna began a relationship with Saudi businessman Hassan Jameel in 2017. The couple reportedly split in January 2020.\n\nRihanna is well known for her tattoos, the most famous of which (such as the tribal design on her hand, the gun on her ribcage, and the \"shhh...\" on her finger) have been done by New York tattoo artist Bang Bang.

He was arrested on suspicion of making criminal threats. On March 5, 2009, Brown was charged with assault and making criminal threats. Due to a leaked photograph from the police department obtained by TMZ.com—which revealed that Rihanna had sustained visible injuries—an organization known as STOParazzi proposed \"Rihanna's Law\", which, if enacted, would \"deter employees of law enforcement agencies from releasing photos or information that exploits crime victims.\" Gil Kaufman of VH1 reported the \"nonstop coverage of the Rihanna/Brown case has brought up a number of issues regarding the privacy of alleged victims of domestic violence, including the decision by almost all major news outlets to divulge the identity of the victim—which is not typically done in domestic-violence cases\" and discussed the controversial distribution of the leaked photograph. Rihanna was subpoenaed to testify during a preliminary hearing in Los Angeles on June 22, 2009. On June 22, 2009, Brown pleaded guilty to felony assault. Brown received five years of probation and was ordered to stay away from Rihanna, unless at public events, which then would be reduced to .\nOn September 2, 2009, Brown spoke about the domestic violence case in a pre-recorded \"Larry King Live\" interview, his first public interview about the matter. He was accompanied to the interview by his mother, Joyce Hawkins, and attorney Mark Geragos, as he discussed growing up in a household with his mother being repeatedly assaulted by his stepfather. Brown said of hearing details of his assault of Rihanna, \"I'm in shock, because, first of all, that's not who I am as a person, and that's not who I promise I want to be.\"\n\nIn March 2018, Rihanna posted a statement shaming Snapchat for mocking her domestic violence situation. The ad put out by Snapchat asked if users would rather \"slap Rihanna or punch Chris Brown\" in a \"Would You Rather\" format. Snapchat issued an apology statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

OOCL has 59 vessels of different classes, with capacity varying from to , including two ice-class vessels for extreme weather conditions.\n\nOOCL is a member of the Grand Alliance formed in 1998. Its founder members are Hapag-Lloyd (Germany), NYK (Japan) and OOCL (Hong Kong).\nOOCL offers around 78 weekly services around the world. Linking Asia, Europe, North America, the Mediterranean, the Indian sub-continent, the Middle East, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nOOCL affiliated companies own or operate dedicated container terminals in North America and Asia, namely: Long Beach Container Terminal in California and KAOCT in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.\n\nBeginning in 1993, the group adopted the Integrated Regional Information System (IRIS-2), specifically designed for the container shipping industry. IRIS-2 integrates the business processes of all OOCL offices, customers' shipments and financial information into one system. OOCL was a finalist for the Smithsonian Institution Award for Innovation in 1999 for its achievements with IRIS-2. The program is written in GemStone/S Smalltalk, making it one of the largest Smalltalk applications in the world.\n\nOn 24 April 2018, OOCL revealed that it had come to an agreement with Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) to investigate the potential of Artificial Intelligence to improve network operations and efficiencies for the shipping industry.\n\nOOCL was the first container shipping line to have achieved the Safety, Quality and Environmental (SQE) Management System certification (which consolidates the ISM-Code, ISO9001.2000 and ISO14001 requirements)\n\nIn 1992, five years in advance of the Montreal Protocol, an international treaty designed to protect the Earth's ozone layer, OOCL changed the design of its refrigerated container machinery in order to eliminate the use of CFCs.\n\nOOCL maintained a 100 percent compliance with the Port of Long Beach Green Flag program in 2006 and 2007. OOCL donated its rebates, totaling US$140,000, back to community projects and charities in Long Beach. From 1 January 2006, OOCL stopped using pre-1989 trucks for all port moves between Southern Californian terminals and off-dock rail ramps, helping to reduce emissions as part of the Port's \"Clean Truck Program\" It also complies with the Qualship 21 program, which identifies quality operation of non-US-flagged vessels.\n\nOOCL has a had a fuel saving program in place since 2001, to cut down on greenhouse gases. Initiatives to minimize fuel consumption include:\n\nOOCL conducted a Shore Power Study (in 2003) and a Sea Water Scrubber Study (in 2005) in order to identify different ways to reduce emissions, both in port and at sea.\n\nThe \"Tung OOCL Scholarship\" was set up in 1995 to support the continued education of young people. Currently, the Tung OOCL Scholarship comprises two programs: University Scholarship Program (China) and Employee's Children Scholarship Program. The University Scholarships have been established in six universities. They are Tsinghua University, Peking University, Fudan University, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Zhejiang University and Nanjing University. Since the establishment of the scholarship more than 2,500 undergraduate and post-graduate students have been awarded scholarships with more than US$2.3 million in funding. Every year, a selection panel is set up in each university to shortlist potential candidates, based on academic results and performance, plus active participation in extracurricular activities. Based on the same selection criteria, the Employees' Children Scholarship is awarded annually to the children of employees in all OOCL offices.\n\nOOCL also participates in many other types of community support.

The ISPS Code states that, as threat increases, the only logical counteraction is to reduce vulnerability. Subsequently, ships will be subject to a system of survey, verification, certification, and control to ensure that their security measures are implemented. This system will be based on a considerably expanded control system as stipulated in the 1974 Convention for Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS). The company also complies with the Container Security Initiative (CSI) and the US Customs 24-Hour Advance Cargo Manifest Declaration Rule.\n\nOOCL Logistics Ltd. (OLL), the OOIL Group's international freight consolidation and logistics service unit, began in 1979. Services extend from basic freight consolidation services to the management and operation of more comprehensive programs involving multi-modal transportation, warehousing and distribution activities.\n\nOOCL was founded by C. Y. Tung in 1947 as the Orient Overseas Line. In 1969, OOL was the first Asian -based shipping line to transport containerized cargo across the Pacific. Consequently, the company was renamed Orient Overseas Container Line. In those days its Victory-class vessels could carry 300 TEU, a far cry from today's post-Panamax vessels. In April 2003, OOCL took delivery of the SX-Class \"OOCL Shenzhen\", then the largest containership ever built at 8,063 TEU. In 2006, it lost its title to the \" Emma Mærsk\". At its peak, OOCL had a fleet of over 150 freight ships, with a cargo capacity exceeding 10 million tons; it was one of the world's top seven shipping lines.

Tung, assumed the leadership of Orient Overseas (International) Limited (OOIL), OOCL's parent company for 14 years. In 1996, C. C. Tung took over at the helm on his brother C. H. Tung's election as Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.\n\nIn September 1970, Tung purchased the ocean liner to convert it into a floating university, to be known as \"Seawise University\", as part of the World Campus Afloat programme. On 9 January 1972, the ship caught fire during refurbishing and sank in Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour and the wreckage had to be scrapped three years later.\n\nIn 2003, OOCL lost one of its senior executives, Courtenay Allan, the company's Transatlantic Trade Director. Allen died after falling down a lift shaft on the \"OOCL Montreal\" in Le Havre.\n\nIn recent years, OOCL has taken over a number of well-known shipping lines. These include Furness Withy, Houlder Brothers, Manchester Liners, Shaw Savill, PSNC, Prince Line & the Alexander Shipping Company.\n\nIn 2015, OOCL ordered six of the largest container ships, holding up to 20,150 TEU each. The first of these, the OOCL Hong Kong, was christened on 12 May 2017. The ship became the world's first container ship to exceed 21,000 TEU mark and achieved a Guinness World Record.\n\nIn July 2017, the parent company, OOIL, received a US$6.3 billion take over bid from its Chinese rival, COSCO. The bid has been accepted subject to shareholder and regulatory approval.\n\nThe fleet consists of 59 vessels of 6 different classes. There are variations within each class.\n\n\n"}

She also had a career as a child singer starting in the early 1980s. She is the daughter of music producer Don Costa and is married to Australian producer/songwriter Justin Stanley.\n\nNikka Costa was born in Tokyo, Japan. Her father Don Costa was a producer and musician. During her childhood Costa was surrounded by famous musicians and traveled around the world with her father.\n\nAt age 5 Costa recorded a single with Hawaiian singer Don Ho. Italian producers Danny B. Besquet and Tony Renis were working with her father on the album \"Don Costa Plays the Beatles\" when they had a brainstorm to produce an album with Nikka singing while her father played acoustic guitar. The album was well received in Europe and Costa became known as a child star. At age 9 Costa sang with Frank Sinatra in an appearance on the lawn of the White House.\n\nCosta's career as a recording artist under her own name started in 1981, when she recorded the song \"(Out Here) On My Own\" (from the movie \"Fame\"). The single reached #72 in Germany, #7 in Switzerland, #32 in the Netherlands, #13 in the Flanders region of Belgium., and #1 in Italy. The album \"Nikka Costa\" was released outside the U.S. in 1981. Costa toured the world. Her second album \"Fairy Tales (cuentos de hadas)\" was released in 1983. Don Costa died of a heart attack shortly after the album was recorded. The pop album \"Here I Am... Yes, It's Me\" was released to fulfill a contractual obligation in 1989.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Costa decided to move away from pop and moved toward funk and soul, becoming influenced by Motown artists.\n\nWhile already a music business veteran, in the early 1990s Costa transitioned away from childhood pop to mature soul. She married Australian producer/songwriter Justin Stanley and moved to his country. (Costa and Stanley now have a daughter named Sugar McQueen.) While in Australia, Costa began writing her own songs and formed a \"happy funk\" band called Little Mona & the Shag Daddies, which broke up after four gigs in Sydney. Costa's next venture was a band called Sugarbone, which toured Australia in 1994. Costa describes the experience as \"It was really scary to unveil it but the reaction was good. It helped my confidence.\" After Sugarbone, she signed to the Mushroom label in Australia. In 1996 Costa released the album \"Butterfly Rocket\" in Australia. The record led to a nomination for ARIA Music Awards Breakthrough Artist in 1996 and Best Female Artist in 1997.\n\nIn 2000, Costa's song \"Like A Feather\" was featured in a Tommy Hilfiger television advertising campaign. That exposure coupled with the track's music video helped launch her U.S. music career. The album \"Everybody Got Their Something\" was released in 2001 and reached #120 on the \"Billboard\" 200. The title track and \"Like a Feather\" were radio hits, although the latter did peak at #53 in the United Kingdom.

The belief its holders were considered world champions was expressed by Jesse Ventura, an announcer for some of its defenses. Velvet McIntyre and Princess Victoria were recognized as the inaugural champions when they came to the promotion in 1983 as the NWA Women's World Tag Team Champions. The final champions were The Glamour Girls (Leilani Kai and Judy Martin) when the titles were abandoned in 1989.\n\nIn 1983, the team of Velvet McIntyre and Princess Victoria joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) as the reigning NWA Women's World Tag Team Champions. However, the WWF had since withdrawn from the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), and the rights to the championship were owned by The Fabulous Moolah. The WWF in turn bought the rights to the championship from Moolah, and recognized McIntyre and Victoria as the first WWF Women's Tag Team Champions. This ended the lineage of the NWA Women's World Tag Team Championship, though the WWF continued to use the championship belts of the former title to represent their new title. After six years, the championship was abandoned in 1989, with The Glamour Girls (Leilani Kai and Judy Martin) as the final champions. This happened largely due to the lack of tag teams in the women's division, and a lack of female performers in general.\n\nDuring the December 24, 2018, episode of \"Monday Night Raw\", WWE Chairman/CEO Vince McMahon announced that a new WWE Women's Tag Team Championship would be introduced in 2019, however, it does not carry the lineage of the original.\n\nOver the course of the championship's six-year history, there were five reigns between four championship teams, composed of seven individual champions. The inaugural championship team was Velvet McIntyre and Princess Victoria. The Glamour Girls (Leilani Kai and Judy Martin) had the most reigns as a team at two, while individually, Kai, Martin, and McIntyre had the most reigns, also at two. The Glamour Girls' first reign was the longest reign at 909 days, and they had the longest combined reign at 1,157 days. The Jumping Bomb Angels (Noriyo Tateno and Itsuki Yamazaki) had the shortest reign at 136 days.

It is the concept of \"open source\" computer software applied to music. However, the non-commercial stipulation associated with Open Music is incompatible with the first section of the Open Source Definition as well as the first freedom put forth in The Free Software Definition (freedom 0). Open Music is one of the general responses to the RIAA's and governmental actions against the music industry and its consumers.\n\n\"Open music\" can be considered a subset of \"free music\" (referring to freedom). The differences of philosophy between advocates of \"open source software\" and \"free software\" have not surfaced in the community of musicians contributing music to the copyleft commons. This may be due to the relatively recent emergence of copyleft music, as well as to the fact that software development generally involves much more collaboration and derivatization than does music production. It is not clear that open collaboration using copyleft licenses provides any significant advantages in music production, as open source advocates commonly argue is the case for software development.\n\nSeveral websites have surfaced to provide musicians with the platform and tools necessary for online music collaboration.

The penalty can be lessened in severity, in duration, or both. Unlike most pardons by government and overturning by the court (a full overturning is equal to an acquittal), a commutation does not affect the status of a defendant's underlying criminal conviction.\n\nAlthough the concept of commutation may be used to broadly describe the substitution of a lesser criminal penalty for the original sentence, some jurisdictions have historically used the term only for the substitution of a sentence of a different character than was originally imposed by the court. For example, the substitution of a sentence of parole for the original sentence of incarceration. A jurisdiction that uses that definition of commutation would use another term, such as a remission, to describe a reduction of a penalty that does not change its character.\n\nA commutation does not reverse a conviction and the recipient of a commutation remains guilty in accordance with the original conviction. For example, someone convicted of capital murder may have their sentence of death commuted to life imprisonment, a lessening of the punishment that does not affect the underlying criminal conviction, as may occur on a discretionary basis or following upon a change in the law or judicial ruling that limits or eliminates the death penalty.\n\nIn some jurisdictions a commutation of sentence may be conditional, meaning that the convicted person may be required to abide by specified conditions or may lose the benefit of the commutation. The conditions must be lawful and reasonable, and will typically expire when the convicted completes any remaining portion of his or her sentence. For example, the pardon may be conditioned upon the person's being a law-abiding citizen, such that if the beneficiary of the commutation commits a new crime before the condition expires the original sentence may be restored.\n"}

The genus includes both annual and perennial species, mostly with erect 3-sided stems and 3-ranked leaves. The achenes bear a beak-like tubercule (hence the name “beak-rush”, although the plants are sedges, not rushes) and are sometimes subtended by bristles. Many of the species are similar in vegetative appearance, and mature fruits are needed to make a positive identification.\n\nThe inflorescences (spikelets) are sometimes subtended by bracts which can be leaf-like or showy.\n\n\"Rhynchospora\" occurs on all continents except Antarctica, but is most diverse in the neotropics. It is most frequent in sunny habitats with wet, acidic soils. In marshes and savannas, \"Rhynchospora\" may be the dominant form of vegetation.\n\nContemporary taxonomic treatments include \"Rhynchospora\" and the related genus \"Pleurostachys\" in the tribe Rhynchosporae, a well-supported clade within Cyperaceae. The most comprehensive monograph of the genus divides \"Rhynchospora\" into two subgenera and 29 sections. A recent molecular analysis identifies two primary clades within the genus, with well-supported subgroups that agree with several of the sections identified by Kükenthal. However, this molecular analysis also suggests that \"Pleurostachys\" is embedded within one of the primary clades of \"Rhynchospora\" and that several of the recognized sections are not monophyletic.\n\n\n"}

Summers (July 12, 1918 – August 3, 1983) was a United States Army soldier and a decorated war veteran. He served with the 1st Battalion, 502nd Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division in World War II.\n\nSummers was born in Marion County, West Virginia, one of six sons to William L. Summers and Florence Swisher.\n\nSummers worked as a coal miner in Rivesville, West Virginia. A highway bridge there is named in his honor.\n\nOn June 6, 1944, Summers landed as part of the first night drop of troops during the American airborne landings in Normandy. His unit had captured Saint-Germain-de-Varreville, France, near Exit 4 off Utah Beach. Summers and 15 soldiers were ordered by 1st Battalion commander, Lt Col. Patrick Cassidy, to capture a building complex nearby designated \"WXYZ\" on the field order map. The buildings turned out to be the barracks for 100 or more German soldiers.\n\nSummers led the attack, charging inside with his Thompson submachine gun. He had ordered the others to follow, however only Private William Burt and Private John Camien followed him while the other soldiers stayed behind. He and the two others cleared out the buildings. Five hours later, the position was clear, and Summers killed more than 30 German soldiers.\n\nSummers received an honorable discharge on November 30, 1945, as a 1st Lieutenant. Summers was twice nominated for the Medal of Honor for his efforts that day, however was instead awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.\n\nWorld War II historian Stephen Ambrose described him this way:\n\nSummers is a legend with American paratroopers ..., the Sergeant York of World War II. His story has too much John Wayne/Hollywood in it to be believed, except that more than 10 men saw and reported his exploits.\n\nSummers died of lung cancer on August 3, 1983. He was buried in Beverly Hills Memorial Park in Morgantown, West Virginia. After his death, his friends and fellow soldiers tried to get him posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor; however the effort failed.\n\n\n"}

WNYE is operated by NYC Media, a division of the Mayor's Office of Media and Entertainment, along with WNYE-TV (channel 25). WNYE's studios are located at the City University of New York’s Graduate Center at 365 Fifth Avenue, while its transmitter is located at the former Condé Nast Building. Because its funding comes from the City of New York, WNYE is different from most non-commercial radio stations in that it does not ask for listener donations and it airs no fund drives.\n\nWNYE began broadcasting as a high-frequency Apex band station in November 1938 with the call sign WCNY, giving it an earlier starting date than any other FM station in New York City. In October 1939 the call letters were changed to WNYE because the original call sign was considered to be too similar to WNYC, the New York City municipal station. WNYE switched to 42.1 MHz in the old FM band in 1942. In 1946, it moved to 91.7 MHz, in today's current FM band; then in 1948, it settled at 91.5 MHz. \n\nThe station's original licensee was the New York City Board of Education, and as such WNYE was a laboratory devoted to programming designed for the city's public school system and known as the High School of the Air. As time went on, WNYE also broadcast adult learning, community-interest and ethnic programming as well. The station's studios and transmitter were originally located at the Brooklyn Technical High School. In 1967, the Board of Education added a television station, WNYE-TV Channel 25, also broadcasting classroom instruction programs and other educational shows. In the mid-1990s, WNYE's studios were moved to nearby George Westinghouse High School in Downtown Brooklyn.\n\nIn December 2004, the Department of Education transferred the licenses of WNYE-FM-TV to the New York City Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications. The transfer integrated WNYE-FM-TV's operations with those of the city-owned cable television services CUNY-TV and Crosswalks Television Network, combining them to form NYC Media. WNYE's programming format remained largely unchanged at that time, but in March 2007 the station was rebranded as \"Radio New York, WNYE 91.5 FM,\" and in 2009 it launched its digital programming with a new transmitter located at the Condé Nast Building (4 Times Square).\n\nOn February 11, 2008, the station management announced a partnership with Seattle station KEXP-FM to produce a new format branded as \"Radio Liberation\", featuring indie rock music simulcast from KEXP. The format started on March 24, 2008, replacing a number of NPR, BBC and Public Radio International shows.\n\nOn June 1, 2011 KEXP was replaced with \"The Alternate Side\" from Fordham University's WFUV. It featured indie rock and alternative rock programming. This ended on August 21, 2015. \n\nAs of August 31, 2015 WNYE airs adult album alternative music by simulcasting WFUV weekdays from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. On weekday late mornings and afternoons, the station airs news programming from NPR and other public radio organizations. That includes the NPR news show \"All Things Considered,\" \"Here and Now\" from WBUR-FM in Boston and \"1A,\" a news and interview program from WAMU in Washington, D.C. Late nights, music programs are heard including the \"World Cafe\" from WXPN Philadelphia, \"Afropop Worldwide\" from Public Radio International and \"Echoes\" which specializes in ambient and electronic music. Evenings and weekends are devoted to ethnic programming for the Greek, Irish, Croatian, Haitian, Slavic and Brazilian communities. In the early 2010s, it carried New York Islanders hockey games, simulcast with WRHU in Hempstead, New York.\n\n"}

He is a member of Freestyle Fellowship, Haiku D'Etat and The A-Team and a co-founder of Project Blowed. Aceyalone is best known for his role in evolving left-field hip-hop on the West Coast at a time when the West Coast was dominated by Gangsta Rap.\n\nAceyalone emerged from the legendary Project Blowed collective, considered to be the longest-running open mic hip-hop workshop. He began rapping as part of the group Freestyle Fellowship, which consisted of himself, Myka 9, and Self Jupiter and, later, P.E.A.C.E.. Freestyle Fellowship developed a reputation for influencing a style of fast double-time rap used by rappers like Busta Rhymes and Bone Thugs-n-Harmony.\n\nFollowing the Freestyle Fellowship releases of \"To Whom It May Concern...\" and \"Innercity Griots\" as well as a Project Blowed compilation in 1994, Aceyalone signed as a solo artist to Capitol Records after Island failed to break the Freestyle Fellowship on mainstream radio.\n\nAceyalone released his breakthrough solo debut album, \"All Balls Don't Bounce\", in 1995. He returned three years later with his second album \"A Book of Human Language\", a collaboration with producer Mumbles, which was a dark concept album.\n\nHis third solo album, \"Accepted Eclectic\", was released in 2001, featuring Abstract Rude and production from Evidence. He released \"Hip Hop and the World We Live In\" in 2002. Aceyalone's next offering came a year later, and was titled \"Love & Hate\". The track \"Find Out\" was featured on the soundtrack to \"You Got Served\". In 2006, Aceyalone released \"Magnificent City\", a collaborative album with producer RJD2, followed by the \"Grand Imperial\" mixtape.\n\nAceyalone frequently collaborates with producer Bionik such as on the 2007 release \"Lightning Strikes\" and the 2009 release \"Aceyalone & the Lonely Ones\". Both albums explored different genres – dancehall and doo-wop respectively – as part of Aceyalone's goal of \"exploring the world of music through hip hop.\" The Phil Spector-inspired \"Aceyalone & the Lonely Ones\" followed. Inspired by Spector's Wall of Sound, Motown and Bo Diddley, Aceyalone said: \"I'm not from that era, but this is my ode to it. I'm just putting myself into that character as a showman and bandleader.\" \"Leanin' on Slick\", released in 2013 with Decon Records, continued the retro flow of the previous release, this time taking inspiration from 1960s style-R&B and hot buttered soul.\n\nAceyalone has been noted particularly for his innovative lyrical style and content. Some attribute the double-time rap styles that emerged in the mid-1990s to Aceyalone and Freestyle Fellowship, although this is disputed by others.\n\nAceyalone and Freestyle Fellowship were noted for their rejection of the West Coast trend in Gangsta Rap. Aceyalone developed strong critiques of rap music’s commercialization and glorification of violence.\n\nAceyalone\n\nFreestyle Fellowship \n\nHaiku d'Etat \n\nThe A-Team \n\n\n"}

They speak Amis, an Austronesian language, and are one of the sixteen officially recognized groups of Taiwanese aborigines. The traditional territory of the Amis includes the long, narrow valley between the Central Mountains and the Coastal Mountains (Huatung Valley), the Pacific coastal plain eastern to the Coastal Mountains and the Hengchun Peninsula.\n\nIn 2014, the Amis numbered 200,604. This was approximately 37.1% of Taiwan's total indigenous population, making them the largest indigenous group. The Amis are primarily fishermen due to their coastal location. They traditionally have a matrilineal kinship system, by which inheritance and property pass through the maternal line, and children are considered born to the mother's people. \n\nTraditional Amis villages were relatively large for indigenous groups, typically holding between 500 and 1,000 people. In today's Taiwan, the Amis also comprise the majority of \"urban aboriginals\" and have developed many urban communities all around the island. In recent decades, Amis have also married exogamously to the Han as well as other indigenous peoples.\n\nThe Amis people generally identify as Pangcah, which means \"human\" or \"people of our kind.\" But in 21st-century Taiwan, the term Amis is much more frequently used. This name comes from the word \"amis\", meaning \"north.\" There is still no consensus in the academic circle as to how \"Amis\" came to be used to address the Pangcah. It may originally have been a term used by the Puyuma to refer to the Pangcah, who lived to the north of them. Another theory is that those who lived in the Taitung Plain called themselves \"Amis\" because their ancestors had come from the north. This later explanation is recorded in the \"Banzoku Chōsa Hōkokusho\", indicating this term may have originated from a group classified by anthropologists as Falangaw Amis, the Amis group occupying territory from today's Chenggong to the Taitung Plain. Their closest genetic relatives appear to be the Filipino people.\n\nAccording to \"Taiwanese Aboriginal History: Amis\", the Amis are classified into five groups:\n\n\nSuch classification, however widely accepted, is based simply on the geographical distribution and ethnic migration. It does not correspond to observed differences in culture, language, and physiques.\n\nFamily affairs, including finance of the family, are decided by the female householder, in the Ami tradition. The most important traditional ceremony is the Harvest Festival. The Ami's Harvest festival is held to express the people's thanks and appreciation to the gods, and to pray for harvest in the next coming year. It takes place every July to September.\n\nThe musical project Enigma used an Ami chant in their song \"Return to Innocence,\" on their second album, \"The Cross of Changes\" (1993). This song was used as the theme song of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. The main chorus was sung by Difang (Chinese name Kuo Ying-nan) and his wife, Igay (Chinese name Kuo Hsiu-chu), who were part of a Taiwanese aboriginal cultural performance group. \n\nMaison des Cultures du Monde had earlier recorded the singing of this group while on tour, and released a CD. \nThis song was subsequently used by Enigma (although they did not note the ethnic origin of the song and the singers). The recording studio and the Taiwanese group filed a suit for copyright infringement, which was later settled by Enigma out of court. Ami singing is known for its complex contrapuntal polyphony.\n\n\n\n"}

The group originally consisted of brothers Ala Diamond (Baby Blue) Smith and Spectacular Smith, plus Corey (Slick 'Em) Mathis and Marcus (Pleasure P) Cooper. Pleasure P was the group's main singer while the other three members performed as rappers. After he departed in 2007 to embark on a solo career, the group shuffled through several replacement vocalists.\n\nThe name \"Pretty Ricky\" was taken from a character in the sitcom \"Martin\". The group enjoyed its biggest success in the mid-2000s with their gold-selling albums \"Bluestars\" and \"Late Night Special\", and the platinum singles \"Grind With Me\" and \"On The Hotline\".\n\nIn 1997 while performing together in Miami, Florida Pretty Ricky was signed to Bluestar Entertainment by CEO Joseph \"Blue\" Smith. Supported by their father, Joseph Smith, Sr., who also served as the band's manager and who is of Jamaican descent, the group developed their music under the name of \"Pretty Rickie and The Maverix\" before changing it to \"Pretty Ricky\". With the help from producer Jim Jonsin of the Unusual Suspects production team, Pretty Ricky began to gain desirable attention through their local performances. However, it was not until 2002 that the group encountered their initial success as their song \"Flossin'\" became a huge hit on Miami radio station Power 96.\n\nIn 2004, Pretty Ricky released their first official single \"Grind With Me\". It reached #7 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and was certified Platinum by the RIAA.\n\nThe single made its way to popularity on Power 96, and station assistant program director Eddie Mix sent the single to Craig Kallman of Atlantic Records. After auditioning with Kallman, Pretty Ricky was offered a record deal on the spot.\n\nOn May 17, 2005, Pretty Ricky released their debut album titled \"Bluestars\". It debuted at #16 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart, selling 56,000 copies in the first week, and within several months, was certified Gold by RIAA. On June 15, 2005, Pretty Ricky released their second single from the album, \"Your Body\", which charted on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 at #12.\n\nIn the summer of 2005 the group toured with Omarion, Bow Wow, Chris Brown, Bobby V, and other acts in the Scream Tour IV concert series.\n\nOn November 9, 2006, Pretty Ricky released the first single off their second album, \"Late Night Special\", titled \"On the Hotline\". It peaked on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 at #97 and was certified platinum by the RIAA. In January 2007, \"Late Night Special\" topped the \"Billboard\" 200 album charts with over 132,000 copies sold in the first week. The second single from the album, \"Push It Baby\", featured Sean Paul but failed to crack the Hot 100, reaching only #109. Pleasure P was later expelled from the group after accusations of child molestation surfaced, and was replaced by singer Christopher \"4Play\" Myers, who wrote most of Pretty Ricky's songs.\n\nIn 2008, Pretty Ricky began work on a new album, \"Eighties Babies\", with an intended release date of October 14, 2008, but the album was shelved due to leaking and creative differences. 4Play quit the group in 2009 and was replaced by Emanuel \"Lingerie\" DeAnda. Pretty Ricky then split from Atlantic and signed with independent Atlanta label Big Cat Records, who released their official third album, \"Pretty Ricky\", in November 2009. It charted for only one week on the \"Billboard\" 200, at #97.\n\nIn 2010, Pretty Ricky released the singles \"Personal Freak\" and \"Cookie Cutter\", neither of which charted. On August 10, 2010, they released an extended play titled \"Topless\". In December 2010, the group announced their fourth album, \"Bluestars 2\", was in the works, but the album was never produced.\n\nOn August 12, 2011, Pretty Ricky released a mixtape titled \"Sex Music Vol. 1: Streets N The Sheets\".\n\nAfter a three-year hiatus, Pretty Ricky released the non-charting single \"Puddles\" on February 16, 2015. This marked the return of Pleasure P. \n\nIn 2019, Pretty Ricky joined The Millennium Tour along with B2K, Mario, Chingy, Ying Yang Twins, Lloyd, and Bobby Valentino. on February 21, 2020, Pretty Ricky returned with a new single titled \"Body\", which is set to appear on the group's reunion album.\n"}

He was one of the principal poets of the Delhi School of the Urdu \"ghazal\" and is often remembered as one of the best poets of the Urdu language. His \"takhallus\" (pen name) was Mir. He spent the latter part of his life in the court of Asaf-ud-Daulah in Lucknow.\n\nThe main source of information on Mir's life is his autobiography \"Zikr-e-Mir\", which covers the period from his childhood to the beginning of his sojourn in Lucknow. However, it is said to conceal more than it reveals, with material that is undated or presented in no chronological sequence. Therefore, many of the 'true details' of Mir's life remain a matter of speculation.\n\nMir was born in Agra, India (then called \"Akbarabad\" and ruled by the Mughals) in August or February 1723. His grandfather migrated from Hejaz to Hyderabad State, then to Akbarabad. His philosophy of life was formed primarily by his father, a religious man with a large following, whose emphasis on the importance of love and the value of compassion remained with Mir throughout his life and imbued his poetry. Mir's father died while the poet was in his teens. He left Agra for Delhi a few years after his father's death, to finish his education and also to find patrons who offered him financial support (Mir's many patrons and his relationship with them have been described by his translator C. M. Naim).\n\nSome scholars consider two of Mir's \"masnavis\" (long narrative poems rhymed in couplets), \"Mu'amlat-e-ishq\" (The Stages of Love) and \"Khwab o khyal-e Mir\" (\"Mir's Vision\"), written in the first person, as inspired by Mir's own early love affairs, but it is by no means clear how autobiographical these accounts of a poet's passionate love affair and descent into madness are. Especially, as Frances W. Pritchett points out, the austere portrait of Mir from these masnavis must be juxtaposed against the picture drawn by Andalib Shadani, whose inquiry suggests a very different poet, given to unabashed eroticism in his verse.\n\nMir lived much of his life in Mughal Delhi. \"Kuchha Chelan\", in Old Delhi was his address at that time. However, after Ahmad Shah Abdali's sack of Delhi each year starting 1748, he eventually moved to the court of Asaf-ud-Daulah in Lucknow, at the king's invitation. Distressed to witness the plundering of his beloved Delhi, he gave vent to his feelings through some of his couplets.\n\nMir migrated to Lucknow in 1782 and stayed there for the remainder of his life. Though he was given a kind welcome by Asaf-ud-Daulah, he found that he was considered old-fashioned by the courtiers of Lucknow (Mir, in turn, was contemptuous of the new Lucknow poetry, dismissing the poet Jur'at's work as merely 'kissing and cuddling'). Mir's relationships with his patron gradually grew strained, and he eventually severed his connections with the court. In his last years Mir was very isolated. His health failed, and the untimely deaths of his daughter, son and wife caused him great distress.\n\nHe died of a purgative overdose on Friday, 21 September 1810. The marker of his burial place was removed in modern times when a railway was built over his grave.\n\nHis complete works, \"Kulliaat\", consist of six \"Diwans\" containing 13,585 couplets, comprising all kinds of poetic forms: \"ghazal\", \"masnavi\", \"qasida\", \"rubai\", \"mustezaad\", satire, etc. Mir's literary reputation is anchored on the \"ghazals\" in his \"Kulliyat-e-Mir\", much of them on themes of love. His masnavi \"Mu'amlat-e-Ishq\" (The Stages of Love) is one of the greatest known love poems in Urdu literature.\n\nMir lived at a time when Urdu language and poetry was at a formative stage – and Mir's instinctive aesthetic sense helped him strike a balance between the indigenous expression and new enrichment coming in from Persian imagery and idiom, to constitute the new elite language known as \"Rekhta\" or \"Hindui\". Basing his language on his native Hindustani, he leavened it with a sprinkling of Persian diction and phraseology, and created a poetic language at once simple, natural and elegant, which was to guide generations of future poets.\n\nThe death of his family members, together with earlier setbacks (including the traumatic stages in Delhi), lend a strong pathos to much of Mir's writing – and indeed Mir is noted for his poetry of pathos and melancholy.\n\nMir's famous contemporary, also an Urdu poet of no inconsiderable repute, was Mirza Rafi Sauda. Mir Taqi Mir was often compared with the later day Urdu poet, Mirza Ghalib. Lovers of Urdu poetry often debate Mir's supremacy over Ghalib or vice versa. It may be noted that Ghalib himself acknowledged, through some of his couplets, that Mir was indeed a genius who deserved respect.

After a stint to the northeast, the designation changes once again to South Garrison Avenue. This commercial strip is interrupted by another short stint at the intersection with West Centennial Avenue, paralleling the nearby freight railroad tracks. At the intersection with West Central Avenue (Route 96), Route 571 turns westward along West Central from South Garrison, creating a concurrency. The two highways create a commercial strip down West Central, crossing under the railroad near North Parsons Street. Route 571 terminates at an interchange with I-49/US 71 (Trooper Charles P.

Golfer Casey Martin, whose circulatory condition impaired his ability to walk, sued the PGA Tour under the ADA, asserting that it must accommodate his disability by allowing him to use a golf cart. The Supreme Court ruled for Martin in a 7–2 decision.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in favor of Martin in a 7–2 decision. The court found that the PGA Tour should be viewed as a commercial enterprise operating in the entertainment industry for the economic benefit of its members rather than as a private club. It agreed with the Magistrate Judge Thomas Coffin that the statutory definition of public accommodation included a \"golf course\", rejecting the Tour's argument that its competitions are only places of public accommodation in the areas open to spectators. The operator of a public accommodation could not, in Judge Coffin's view, create private enclaves within the facility \"… and thus relegate the ADA to hop-scotch areas.\" The finding was originally upheld by the United States Court for the Ninth Circuit.\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia wrote a dissent that concluded by referencing Kurt Vonnegut's story \"Harrison Bergeron.\"\n\nMartin has failed to make it through the PGA Tour Q-school since 2000.

Page initially recorded and performed it with the Yardbirds and later included it in many Led Zeppelin concerts. \n\nAccording to biographer Keith Shadwick, it is based on an old Irish folk song, \"specifically derived from 'She Moved Through the Fair' in the 1963 version by [Davy] Graham, which he in turn credited to Padraic Colum\". The later Led Zeppelin song \"Over the Hills and Far Away\" was \"spun off\" from \"White Summer\" as well as an unreleased 20-minute instrumental recorded in early 1974 at Headley Grange.\n\n\"White Summer\" was recorded 28–29 April 1967 at De Lane Lea Studios in London. Jimmy Page was the only band member to perform on the recording and was accompanied by Chris Karan on tabla and an unidentified oboe player doubling the melody line. The song combines elements of traditional Eastern as well as Western music. In a 1977 interview, Page commented, \"I used a special tuning for [the song]; the low string down to D, then A, D, G, A and D. It’s like a modal tuning, a sitar tuning, in fact\". He added that he called this tuning \"'C.I.A.' tuning—Celtic-Indian-Arabic—because that's what it was ... D–A–D–G–A–D was something going around the folk scene during the 1960s\" and was used by Davy Graham for his \"She Moved Through the Fair\".\n\n\"White Summer\" was released on the Yardbirds' last album, \"Little Games\". An alternate take/mix without the accompaniment was included on the 1992 Yardbirds compilation \"Cumular Limit\". It was a staple of live Yardbird performances with Jim McCarty usually providing a drum part and appears on the albums \"\" and \"Glimpses 1963–1968\". When playing the song live with the Yardbirds, Page used a 1961 Danelectro 3021 guitar.\n\nLed Zeppelin frequently performed \"White Summer\" as part of a medley with \"Black Mountain Side\" during their 1968–70 tours and again on the 1977 US, 1979 and 1980 Europe tours. A live performance during the band's U.K. Tour of Summer 1969 was recorded by the BBC at the Playhouse Theatre in London on 27 June 1969 for the pilot of Radio One's \"In Concert\" series. This recording was produced by Jeff Griffin and released in 1990 on the \"Led Zeppelin Boxed Set\" with the combined title \"White Summer/Black Mountain Side\". The piece was later included in the expanded 1993 reissue of \"Coda\" from \"The Complete Studio Recordings\" and \"Led Zeppelin Definitive Collection\" (2008) box sets.\n\nPage used his Danelectro to play the medley, as shown on 2003's \"Led Zeppelin DVD\", which was filmed at the Royal Albert Hall on 9 January 1970. On 23 April 1970, Page performed the piece on the \"Julie Felix Show\". Page also played it when he was with the Firm and again during his \"Outrider\" tour, seguing into \"White Summer/Black Mountain Side\" as part of the solo section of \"Midnight Moonlight\".\n"}

The Eclipse was based on many of the same concepts as the Data General Nova, but included support for virtual memory and multitasking more suitable to the small office than the lab. It was also packaged differently for this reason, in a floor-standing case the size of a small refrigerator.\n\nIf the Nova was an improved PDP-8, the Eclipse was meant to compete against larger\nPDP-11 computers. However, it kept the simple register architecture, and the stack\nwas kept in a special memory address location, as it was on the later 32-bit Data General Eclipse MV/8000. The AOS operating system was quite sophisticated, and far advanced compared to the PDP-11 offerings, with access control lists (ACLs) for file protection. One of the key goals for the 32-bit MV was to be able to run 16-bit applications without modification, and the AOS/VS 32-bit operating system would indeed run 16-bit AOS binaries. (By contrast, although the VAX-11 could run PDP-11 code in a compatibility mode, the MV/8000 did not require a \"mode bit.\")\n\nProduction problems with the Eclipse led to a rash of lawsuits in the late 1970s, after new versions of the machine were pre-ordered by many DG customers and then never arrived. After over a year of waiting, many decided to sue the company, while others simply cancelled their orders and went elsewhere. It appeared that the Eclipse was originally intended to replace the Nova outright, also evidenced by the fact that the Nova 3 series released at the same time was phased out the next year. However, strong continuing demand resulted in the Nova 4, perhaps as a result of the continuing problems with the Eclipse.\n\nThe 16-bit Eclipse series was replaced by the 32-bit Data General Eclipse MV/8000 in 1980. The development of this machine was described by Tracy Kidder in his book \"The Soul of a New Machine\". \n\nThe original Cray-1 system used an Eclipse to act as a Maintenance and Control Unit (MCU). It was configured with two Ampex CRTs, an 80 MB Ampex disk drive, a thermal printer, and a 9-track tape drive. Its primary purpose was to download an image of either the Cray Operating System or customer engineering diagnostics at boot time. Once booted, it acted as a status and control console via RDOS \"station software\".\n"}

It is located north of the urban area of Whitby, at the south junction of Ontario Highways 12 and 7.\n\nBrooklin is located primarily in a rural area, with hills covering the north and the west. The hills and forests that dominate the north are part of the South Slope of the Oak Ridges Moraine. It is located within the Lynde Creek Watershed which retains 19 to 26% of its forest cover. The population has grown steadily since the early 1990s, with the addition of thousands of homes surrounding the heart of Brooklin.\n\n\nFarmlands dominated and some farms have now become residential areas to the south and east; hills and forests are covered with pine and other types of forests especially oaks and birches covers the west, the north and east with some farming. Macedonian Village is located about 6 km to the southwest, housing about 100 residents. The villages of Ashburn and Myrtle are about 5 km to the north of the village. Highway 407 opened on June 20, 2016 and travels just south of Brooklin along a power line transmission corridor.\n\nThe area around Brooklin began to be settled in the 1820s. The community itself grew after 1840, when brothers John & Robert Campbell built a flour mill on Lynde Creek. (The present mill building was built in 1848 after a lightning fire destroyed the original.) The village was originally named Winchester, but renamed when the post office was established to avoid duplication with a village named Winchester in eastern Ontario. In 1847, the residents chose to rename the community Brooklin, possibly from Brooklyn, New York or Brooklin, Maine. It could have been named for the \"brook\" that ran through the town, but this waterway has always been described as a \"creek\", and naming the village after a community in New England or New York is logical since several prominent early residents migrated from there.\n\nProminent people from Brooklin include John Dryden (1840–1909), long-serving agriculture minister of the Province of Ontario. While a government minister, Dryden created the northwestern Ontario experimental farm that eventually led to the formation of the town of Dryden.\n\nHousing developments arrived in the late 1950s with the Meadowcrest subdivision, which expanded the village to the west of Baldwin Street. For several decades after this, there was no further major house construction and Meadowcrest was known colloquially as \"The Subdivision\". Housing activity resumed in the mid-1990s east of the village between Queen Street and Thickson Road with the Village of Brooklin subdivision, and continued into the late-1990s with further developments to the southeast. Housing developments reached Ashburn Road to the west in 2000, the development featuring a decorative pond, and the Olde Winchester subdivision was begun east of Thickson in 2001.\n\nBrooklin is largely a bedroom community and many residents commute to parts of the Greater Toronto Area. The largest employers in Brooklin include Brooklin Concrete Products and a FreshCo.\n\nLacrosse is a popular sport in the area. At one time, Brooklin was known as being the smallest town to have a Major Series Lacrosse team. In 1968, the Brooklin Redmen MSL team won the esteemed Mann Cup, and the team went on to win the cup again in 1969, 1985, 1987, 1988, 1990 and 2000. The team still bears the name of Brooklin, but plays its home games in the southern part of Whitby.\n\nMeadowcrest Public School was for a number of years known as a \"volleyball school\" as it won 4 Provincial Cup awards as well as being the top school in all of Durham for 10 years.\n\nBrooklin and area has 8 elementary schools, including Meadowcrest P.S., Winchester P.S., Brooklin Village P.S., Blair Ridge P.S., St. Leo's C.S., St. Bridget C.S., Blessed John Paul II C.S., and Chris Hadfield P.S. Five high schools service the community (with three located in Whitby south of the village): Brooklin High School, Donald A Wilson Secondary School (French immersion), Saint-Charles Garnier C.S. (French-language instruction), All Saints Catholic Secondary School, and Anderson Collegiate Vocational Institute (gifted). A post office, library, fire hall, community centre, and ice arena are provided to the citizens by the municipal government. Many church communities provide for their adherents, including St. Thomas' Anglican, Brooklin United, St. Leo's Roman Catholic, Burn's Presbyterian (actually located in Ashburn), Renaissance Baptist, Hebron Christian Reform, Unitarian Universalist Congregation Of Durham, and Brooklin Village Church. A shopping plaza is the southern gateway to an older established downtown business corridor.\n\n\n\n"}

The album includes a rendition of Kraftwerk's \"The Model\" in a remixed version from that which appeared on Big Black's then-recent single. The compact disc of \"Songs About Fucking\" added the other side of that single, a cover of Cheap Trick's \"He's a Whore\".\n\nSteve Albini has said that \"Songs About Fucking\" is the Big Black album that he is most satisfied with. In a 1992 interview with \"Maximumrocknroll\" magazine, Albini said: \nThe band had already decided to split up before the album was recorded, prompted by guitarist Santiago Durango's decision to enroll in law school, and the band's desire to quit while at their peak.\n\n\"Songs About Fucking\" has been called \"certainly the most honest album title of the rock'n'roll era\". Lyrical themes on the album include South American killing techniques (\"Colombian Necktie\"), bread that gets you high (\"Ergot\"), and how \"slowly, without trying, everyone becomes what he despises most\". While the album's title (commonly blanked out when displayed in shops on its release) and the sleeve were controversial, according to one reviewer, \"as brutal as that cover is, the music is even more so\", and it was considered \"as dark and frightening as the band name suggests\" by another, \"Treble\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Hubert Vigilla, who goes on to say \"\"Songs About Fucking\" is loud, it's abrasive, it's unattractive in the extreme ... So really, it's everything that made Big Black so great in the first place\". Dave Henderson of \"Underground\" magazine gave the album a 2.5/3 rating, calling it \"a napalm attack that sticks to your skin like burning party-jell, spiced with hundreds and thousands, a prickly sensation that's as all-consuming as it is repellent\".\n\n"}

He is ranked number 46 on \"Bass Player\" magazine's list of \"The 100 Greatest Bass Players of All Time\".\n\nOakley was born in Chicago, Illinois, raised in the suburb of Park Forest, Illinois, then moved to Florida where he met and joined Dickey Betts's band, The Second Coming. He was a founding member of The Allman Brothers Band in 1969, along with guitarists Duane Allman and Dickey Betts, singer and keyboardist Gregg Allman, and drummers and percussionists Butch Trucks and Jai Johanny \"Jaimoe\" Johanson.\n\nOakley was known for his long, melodic bass runs that formed a throbbing foundation underneath Allman and Betts' furious guitar solos and jams. \"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed\", \"Mountain Jam\" and \"Whipping Post\" from the live album \"At Fillmore East\" capture Oakley at his best. Oakley was also the band member most involved in establishing domestic unity among the band's extended family.\nWhen Duane Allman died in a motorcycle accident on October 29, 1971, Oakley was devastated.\n\nOakley's bass guitar, nicknamed \"The Tractor Bass\", was a Fender Jazz Bass with a Guild bass pickup (manufactured by Hagström, a Swedish company).\n\nOn November 11, 1972, Oakley was involved in a motorcycle accident in Macon, Georgia, just three blocks from where Duane Allman had his fatal motorcycle accident the year before. Oakley was driving around a sharp right bend of the road on Napier Avenue at Inverness when he crossed the line and collided at an angle with a city bus making the bend from the opposite direction. After striking the front and then the back of the bus, Oakley was thrown from his bike, just as Allman had been, and struck his head. Oakley said he was okay after the accident, declined medical treatment, and caught a ride home. Three hours later, he was rushed back to the hospital, delirious and in pain, and died of cerebral swelling caused by a fractured skull. Attending doctors stated that even if Oakley had gone straight to the hospital from the scene of the accident, he could not have been saved. He was 24 years old when he died, the same age as Allman.\n\nIn 1998, the Georgia State Legislature passed a resolution designating a bridge on State Highway 19/U.S. Route 41 in Macon, Georgia, as the \"Raymond Berry Oakley III Bridge.\" At the same time, the road carried by the bridge was named Duane Allman Boulevard. The resolution stated that the names were designated \"in honor and remembrance of the late founding members of the Allman Brothers Band.\"\n\nHe is survived by his sister, Candace Rose Oakley, his widow Linda Diane Oakley Miller and daughter, Brittany Ann Oakley (whose photo appeared on the back cover of the Allmans' 1973 album, \"Brothers and Sisters\").

It is a non-immigrant visa, and is valid for a relatively short amount of time, from three months (for Iran nationals) to five years (India, Japan, Germany), based on a \"reciprocity schedule\". With extensions, the maximum stay is seven years.\n\nL-1 visas are available to employees of an international company with offices in both the United States and abroad. The visa allows such foreign workers to relocate to the corporation's US office after having worked abroad for the company for at least one continuous year within the previous three prior to admission in the US. The US and non-US employers must be related in one of four ways: parent and subsidiary; branch and headquarters; sister companies owned by a mutual parent; or \"affiliates\" owned by the same or people in approximately the same percentages. \n\nSpouses of L-1 visa holders are allowed to work without restriction in the US (using an L-2 visa) once EAD is granted, and the L-1 visa may legally be used as a stepping stone to a green card under the doctrine of dual intent.\n\nIn 2010, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) approved 74,719 L-1 visas, out of 91,086 applications (a refusal rate of 18%). In contrast, the same document reports a refusal rate of 21% for the H-1B non-immigrant skilled employment visa (117,409 approvals out of 147,937 applicants) and an overall refusal rate of 23% for all non-immigrant visa categories listed (6,275,540 approvals out of 8,142,444 applicants).\n\nThe L-1 visa has two subcategories:\nAfter the expiration of the 7 or 5 years respectively, the foreign national can generally only qualify for L-1 status again by working abroad for at least 1 year for the parent, subsidiary, affiliate or branch office of the U.S. company.\n\nThere are two types of L-1 procedures:\n\n\nFor a regular L-1 visa, the company must file a petition with the USCIS and each petition is evaluated on its own merits.\n\nIn the case of a blanket L-1 visa petition, it has already been determined by USCIS that the company qualifies for the issuance of Intracompany Transferee visa, so the individual visa applicant need only file a copy of the approved blanket petition, along with documents supporting their personal qualifications, with the U.S. consulate or embassy having jurisdiction over their place of residence proving the applicant's qualifications\n\nApplication to an L-1 visa begins with the filing of a petition with the U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services (USCIS) on Form I-129 along with supporting documentation showing that both the U.S. company and the foreign parent, subsidiary, affiliate or branch meet the qualifying factors set forth in the law and regulations.\n\nNotice of approval of the Form I-129 is given by the USCIS on a Notice of Action, Form I-797, and using this as the basis of the application, the alien may apply for visa issuance at a consulate or embassy of the United States in the country having jurisdiction over their residence.\n\nApplicants who are in the United States at the time of the filing of the I-129 can request a change of status from their present nonimmigrant status (i.e. visitor, student, etc.), so long as they are in status at the time of the filing of the I-129. If they go out of status after the filing, but before approval, there is no negative consequence, and the person does not accrue unlawful presence.\n\nUpon application at the consulate or embassy, the spouse and children of the primary applicant who are under the age of 21 may be issued L-2 visas. Children of the primary L-1 can attend school. The spouse of the primary L-1 has an automatic right to work in the United States. Children cannot accept paid employment. The spouse can, but need not, apply with the USCIS for employment authorization after arriving in the United States and, after issuance of the Employment Authorization Document (EAD, Form I-765), may thereafter work for any employer. According to the Social Security Administration, the L-2 spouse is permitted to work, even without an Employment Authorization Document. However, USCIS takes the position that the L-2 spouse must obtain the Employment Authorization Document for I-9 purposes. The spouse may apply directly to Social Security for issuance of a Social Security Number. The documents required for the L-2 Social Security number application are the same as the L-1 holder, but with the addition of either the EAD or an original marriage certificate.\n\nAn I-797 Notice of Action showing the approval of the visa petition does not guarantee that a visa will be issued at the U.S. consulate or embassy, but L-1 visas are normally approved if the consular officer concludes that the individual is qualified and that both the U.S. company and the foreign parent, subsidiary, affiliate or branch are legitimate.\n\nBasis for visa denial: A consular officer may deny the issuance of an L-1 visa in cases where the officer determines the U.S. company that filed the L-1 petition may not be qualified, or that the parent, subsidiary, affiliate or branch outside the United States is not qualified or does not intend to continue in business after L-1 visa issuance, or that USCIS approved the petition based on a fraud committed by the company or the visa applicant, or that the applicant is ineligible for that class of visa under section 212(a) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act. In addition, the consular officer may request that the underlying petition be reconsidered by USCIS.\n\nFor an L-1 visa applicant, \"dual Intent\" is allowed: unlike some classes of non-immigrant visas (e.g., J-1 visas), L-1 applicants may not be denied a visa on the basis that they are an intending immigrant to the United States, or that they do not have a residence abroad which they do not intend to abandon.\n\nIf the person is a Canadian citizen applying for admission as an L-1 under the North American Free Trade Agreement, the petition may be filed at the port of entry when the person applies for admission.\n\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (Public Law 114-113), signed into law by President Obama on December 18, 2015, increases fees for certain H-1B and L-1 petitioners who employ 50 or more employees in the United States with more than 50 percent of their employees in the United States in H-1B or L (including L-1A and L-1B) nonimmigrant status. These petitioners must submit an additional fee of $4,000 for certain H-1B petitions and $4,500 for certain L-1A and L-1B petitions postmarked on or after December 18, 2015.\n\nL-1 status may be renewed and extended within the United States. Except in the case of blanket petitions, a new I-129 petition must be filed. Renewal in the United States applies to status only, not the actual visa in the passport. For visa renewal, the applicant must go to a U.S. consulate or embassy outside the United States. An alien cannot leave the United States and then reenter without a valid L-1 visa, and must appear personally before a consular officer for visa issuance.\n\nA petition to change status to L-1A may be filed on behalf of a foreign national in L-1B status in order for the individual to move into a managerial position or an executive position. In order for the L-1B worker to be eligible for the full 7 years of L-1 status typically provided to L-1A workers, the petition must be approved by United States Citizenship and Immigration Services at least 6 months prior to the individual reaching the 5-year maximum period in L-1B status.\n\nA person in L-1 status generally may work only for the petitioning company. If the L-1 worker enters based on an L-1 blanket, however, it generally is possible for the worker to be moved in the same capacity to any other related company listed on the blanket. \n\nSome industry representatives have accused companies of utilizing the L-1 program to replace U.S. workers.\n\nAn individual with a valid L-1 visa does not need a visa to enter Costa Rica for tourism for up to 30 days. The L-1 visa must be stamped in the passport and be valid for at least six months. The passport needs to be valid for at least six months after entering Costa Rica.\n\n"}

They are among the most endangered seals in the world, having a total population of only about 400 individuals. The only existing population of these seals is found in Lake Saimaa, Finland (hence the name). They have lived in complete isolation from other ringed seal species for around 9,500 years and have diverged into a morphologically and ecologically different subspecies of ringed seal. The population is descended from ringed seals that were separated from the rest when the land rose after the last ice age. This seal, along with the Ladoga seal and the Baikal seal, is one of the few living freshwater seals.\n\nThe habitat of the Saimaa ringed seal is Lake Saimaa, Finland. The lake spans a circumference of approximately 180 km x 140 km and It has an area of 443 sq mi (1,147 km) and is relatively shallow, averaging about 12m deep and has a max depth of 85 m. Lake Saimaa contains approximately 13,000 islands and has over 14,850 km of shoreline. The freshwater lake freezes over between the months of November and May. Leaving the seals to two types of habitats throughout the year; the ice habitat and open water habitat. The freezing and the lake’s natural architecture create a labyrinth-like habitat for the seals. During summer months when the ice is melted, these islands provide ample space for the seals to molt and breed.\n\nSaimaa ringed seals are named as such due to their only habitat being Lake Saimaa, Finland. Thus, their range is restricted only to the waters of Lake Saimaa and its and surrounding banks.\n\nAn adult Saimaa ringed seal is between in length and weighs between ; males usually being larger than females. They are coloured dark gray, with a gray-black dorsal with circular white rings. The bottom is light gray. The Saimaa ringed seal is darker in color than other ringed seals.\n\nThe Saimaa ringed seal does not have an incredibly varied diet. They are generalist feeders and eat exclusively fish. The fish consumed consist primarily of small schooling fish averaging 8.6 cm in length and up to 21 cm in length, while it has been shown that the pups eat slightly smaller fish than the average. The majority of their diet consists of vendace, smelt, perch and roach. The pups’ diet varies markedly from the adults in that their diet consists primarily of perch and roach found in the shallow water where they spend most of their time in their earlier months while the adults consume more vendace and smelt.\n\nIt was believed for a long time that the Saimaa ringed seal was competing with the commercial and recreational fishing industries and there were bounties paid on them until the 1940s. However it has recently been proven that the Saimaa ringed seal has minimal to no effect on the fishing industry. They do not prey on the local endangered salmon species (\"Salmo salar m. Sebago\", \"S. trutta m. lacustris\", and \"Salvelinus alpines\") and although they do prey on the valuable vendace population, the proportion of the vendace population to the amount consumed by the seals indicates that they do not compete with the local fishing industries.\n\nSaimaa ringed seals have a gender ratio of 1:1 and become mature between the ages of 4 and 6. Their pregnancy rate is between 80 and 95 percent. Ringed seals' gestation lasts 11 months. Their pups are between , and at birth. The Saimaa ringed seal's longevity is just over 20 years.\n\nA study conducted from 1980-84 revealed that Saimaa ringed seals make burrowed dens close to the shore and they reproduce once a year due to their longevity.\n\nSaimaa ringed seals have two kinds of lairs or dens; they have a haul out lair where no breeding takes place, and the breeding lair. Breeding lairs are located closer to the shore than haul out dens.\n\nDiving is an important behavior for aquatic mammals as it is something they rely on for behaviors such as foraging and travelling. The duration of their dives increases from spring to autumn, which may be a result of food availability, but is interesting because they are one of the few land locked seal species. Many studies have been done to observe Saimaa ringed seal diving, and has been discovered to last longer than expected. Their average time for a long dive was recorded to last for 15 min and was believed to be an aerobic resting dive.\n\nThe average dive depth ranges from 10 to 15 m, however, their maximum dive depths were limited by environmental depth. The saimaa ringed seal has also been observed to have seasonal hauling-out patterns. In May and June, when the seals are molting, they are observed to haul out both day and night, however, in late summer they are observed to haul out only at night.\n\nThe saimaa ringed seal is able to complete its dives and navigate in its environment due to its highly developed vibrissae, also known as whiskers. Using their vibrissae they are able to detect sound and pressure waves in their otherwise dark environment.\n\nThe Saimaa ringed seal has been protected since 1955. In 1983, the population was between 100 and 150 seals. In 2005, it was about 270, but as a result of two unfavorable breeding seasons, 2006 and 2007, the number dropped down to 260. In 2013 the population was estimated at just over 300 and the population numbers were in a slight growth. The number of breeding-aged females was 87. It is thought that the immediate threat of extinction would be alleviated if the population grew to over 400 individuals. It is listed as endangered by the U.S. government under the Endangered Species Act.\n\nIn spring 2016, 79 pups were found, four of which were dead.\n\nIn order to protect the Saimaa ringed seal, there are voluntary fisheries restrictions in a part of their living areas. The most important form of restriction is a ban on fishing nets from April 15 to the end of June in about 15% of the lake; nearly all fishing is recreational. Bycatch mortality has, however, remained high with estimated mortality of 20–30 seals annually, most of them pups of the same year.\n\nIn 2010 the European Union required Finland to do more to protect the seals, particularly from net fishing. To reduce the by-catch mortality of seals aged over one year, the use of certain fishing methods has been banned since 2011. The banned fishing methods include strong mesh nets, large fish traps, and fish-baited hooks, in the main part of the Saimaa ringed seal's habitat.\n\nIn 2016, one act and mutual agreements between authorities and owners of fishing waters replace earlier two acts. The fishing co-operatives get 1.7 euros per hectare to monitor that fishing limitations are followed. Net fishing (except of vendace nets) is forbidden between 15 April and end of June in certain areas, which have been drawn at 5 km radius from nesting sites.\n\nBreeding success of Saimaa ringed seal depends on sufficient ice and snow cover. The loss of snow and ice caused by the ongoing climate change poses a direct threat to them. Human-made snowdrifts have proved to be successful in improving seals' breeding success during winters with poor snow conditions. Snowdrifts were tested for three winters, and from 2014 they have been used regularly.\n\nTarget of the protection is to have 400 ringed seals in Saimaa by year 2020.\n\nThe Saimaa ringed seal lives nowadays mainly in two Finnish national parks, Kolovesi and Linnansaari. Strays have been seen in a much larger area, including Savonlinna centre.\n\n"}
{"id": "2110507", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2110507", "title": "Fighters Destiny", "text": "Fighters Destiny\n\nFighters Destiny, known in Japan as is a 1998 video game developed by Genki and published by Imagineer for the Nintendo 64. It closely models the 3D fighting game standard set by Sega's \"Virtua Fighter\", but integrates a unique point scoring system. The game's generic characters and unoriginal presentation have been panned by critics, but reviewers praise its point system and consider it to be one of the best fighting games on the Nintendo 64. It was followed by a 2000 sequel \"Fighter Destiny 2\".\n\nIn \"Fighters Destiny\", the player controls a polygon-based character in a three dimensional battle arena. The game features typical hand to hand combat fighting: using a variety of punches, kicks, locks, and throws, players attempt to pummel their opponents into submission. Each character also has a large list of special commands (called \"moves\") that can be accessed during battle. These different moves range from simply pressing the \"B\" button to inputting button combinations.\n\nIn most versus fighting games, the objective is to deplete the opponent's health gauge. \"Fighters Destiny\" follows the same concept but also relies on a customizable point scoring system to determine the winner. These points, which are displayed as yellow stars under the character's health gauge, can be earned in a variety of ways. By default, knocking the character off the fighting platform (a \"Ring Out\") is worth one point, taking down an opponent with a throw nets the player two points, while a typical K.O. is worth three points, as well as taking the opponent down with a counterattack, and executing a \"special\" is worth four points. Finally, if the adjustable time counter runs out, then the winner is awarded one point by virtue of judge's decision. By default setting, the first fighter to score seven points wins the match.\n\nK.O.'s can be achieved with instant-K.O. hits (referred to as \"1-shot\") or counterattack moves, or can be executed with a finishing blow when the player's opponent is in \"Piyori condition,\" a brief spell of dizziness in which opponent's life bar has been drained completely and the fighter is allowed only limited control. \"Specials\" can only be executed when the opponent is in Piyori condition. If players are able to survive until Piyori condition passes, their health gauge refills completely. The health bar also refills continuously (albeit slowly) throughout the fight.\n\n\"Fighters Destiny\" offers five different gameplay modes. By playing the traditional versus computer mode, players can earn a new character (Boro) and learn new skills for their character. They can also select to fight against a second player, challenge their skills and gain new characters in \"Record Attack,\" play through the \"Master Challenge\" to expand their character's command list, and train against a robot character. When players learn new skills playing the computer or the Master Challenge, they can save their character's expanded command list to the Controller Pak; afterwards, the new command list can be accessed in any mode to aid the player.\n\nThere are nine regular characters in \"Fighters Destiny\": Ryuji, a Japanese karate exponent; Abdul, a well-balanced fighter from Mongolia obsessed with Arabic culture; Tomahawk, a professional wrestler from the United States; Meiling, a Chinese martial artist; a Japanese ninja with a massive catalog of special moves; Pierre, a French clown with a deceptive fighting style; Leon, an all-rounder from Spain; Bob, a powerful Brazilian fighter; and the tough aerial combat specialist Valerie from Germany.\n\nIn addition to the standard nine characters, there are five secret characters that can be unlocked by completing various challenge modes, with the secret characters themselves consisting of a quick and powerful female Swiss warrior named Boro, a Russian jester-esque fighter named Joker, a training robot from Germany named Robert, an old Japanese karate expert named the Master, and a comical fighting cow from Hokkaido named Ushi.\n\n\"Fighters Destiny\" was initially announced under the title \"Struggle Hard\".\n\n\"Fighters Destiny\" received positive reviews. Despite the game's critical acclaim, it missed its initial Christmas release date and was subsequently greeted with lukewarm sales figures, selling only 18,000 copies in the first two months after its North American release. As a result, Infogrames Entertainment (the parent company of \"Fighters Destiny\" international distributor Ocean Software) decided to shave US$20 off the price tag, dropping the game's price to US$29.99. \"\"Fighters Destiny\" has been praised as the best fighting game for the N64 by the vast majority of video game media,\" said Mike Markey, vice president of sales and marketing, Infogrames Entertainment. \"The aim of the new price point is to make the game more accessible to all consumers.\"\n\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the Nintendo 64 version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \"\"Fighters Destiny\" is hands-down the best fighter on Nintendo 64. Mastering the fighting techniques of each character is a challenge, and the depth of the single-player game is impressive.\"\n\nIn 2000, a sequel to \"Fighters Destiny\", titled Fighter Destiny 2, was released. Publisher SouthPeak Games dropped the \"s\" in the title due to copyright issues. \"Fighter Destiny 2\" made improvements upon its predecessor, boosting the FPS to 60, and adding graphic and audio enhancements. Some of the characters make a second appearance in the sequel, but the majority of the cast is all new. Although the game mechanics remain unchanged, a new \"Fighter's Arena\" mode has been added, a giant board game that allows players to build up their characters' attributes in addition to having them learn new fighting skills. The character Ryuji, from the first game, seems to have been renamed as Saeki for unknown reasons.\n\nThere are eleven default characters in \"Fighter Destiny 2\". Ryuji makes a return as Saeki, while Abdul, Meiling and Ninja make another appearance with their original names. Pierre makes another appearance as well, but is now more flamboyant than previously. They are joined by newcomers Adriana, a Samba dancer from Brazil; Federico, a scientist from Italy; American street warrior D-Dog, who very much resembles Dennis Rodman; Fashion Model Kate from Great Britain; German professional wrestler Ziege; and British punk rocker Dixon.\n\nLike in the first game, there are five secret characters to unlock from within the various game modes, with the secret characters themselves consisting of a nobleman from France named Fabien, Ushi (who is now renamed as Mou), Robert (who is now renamed as Samurai), the Master, who once again makes an appearance, and a crossdressing man from the United States named Cherry. In the North American release, Cherry's voice actor is changed to female for appropriateness; however, nothing on his body is changed such as his muscles, his tattoos, and his face, which all resemble a male.\n\nOn release, \"Famitsu\" magazine scored \"Fighter Destiny 2\" a 30 out of 40.\n"}

The band originally formed in 1997 and disbanded in 2003, but announced their official reunion in December 2014.\n\nThe Movielife formed in 1997 in Long Island, New York with vocalist Vinnie Caruana, guitarists Alex Amiruddin and Eddie Reyes, bassist Nick Ghanbarian and drummer Evan Baken. The band recorded a tape titled \"Red Demo\" with Mike Sapone. Reyes left the group to form Runner Up and subsequently Taking Back Sunday. He was replaced by Dave O'Connell, who in turn would leave shortly afterwards to form the Quick Fix Kills, subsequently being replaced by Brandon Reilly. Ghanbarian then left the group and was replaced by Phil Navetta. Ghanbarian would later join Bayside. In 1998, the band recorded another demo tape, titled the \"White Demo\". The demo caught the attention of Fadeway Records, with whom the band signed a one-album contract. The band recorded their debut album with Peng Chia at Tin Pan Alley Studios. \"It's Go Time\" was released through Fadeaway Records in September 1999 and was supported by heavy touring.\n\nWith the band's growing popularity, they almost signed with Equal Vision Records, however they instead signed with Revelation Records. The band recorded their second album with producer Brian McTernan at Salad Days Studio in Washington, DC. \"This Time Next Year\" was released through Revelation Records in October 2000, with touring alongside New Found Glory and Glassjaw to promote it. In 2001, the Movielife signed to Drive-Thru Records, and released to \"Has a Gambling Problem EP\" in November of the same year. During the recording of the follow-up full length, Amiruddin quit to start Keep Breathing. Amiruddin explained that he \"grew disenchanted with the new direction of the music, and my friendships with the other guys in the band suffered for various reasons\". He was replaced by Dan Navetta, Phil's younger brother. In 2003, \"Forty Hour Train Back to Penn\" was released, and the Movielife again set out on tour in support of the effort. The album reached number 164 on the \"Billboard\" 200. On September 29, a note on the band's website revealed that the Movielife had decided to break up.\n\nMost of the members of the Movielife formed other bands; Caruana formed I Am the Avalanche, Reilly formed Nightmare of You, in which Phil Navetta also played briefly, but has since left and currently resides in Queens, NY. Dan Navetta founded Heavy Rescue and a media company, while Baken worked in business management. In 2008, Caruana performed a set of the Movielife with Set Your Goals backing at The Bamboozle festival. On December 16, 2010 a video was posted on Caruana's YouTube account featuring himself and Reilly, announcing that the Movielife will be playing at The Bamboozle in New Jersey, marking their first performance in almost 8 years. They followed this up with a show in New York in August. Caruana remarked in 2015 the group had planned to continue, however, he \"[didn't] think [he] was ready. I don’t think Brandon was ready. The timing was wrong -- we were trying to force it, but our lives weren’t there yet\". Also in 2011, Amiruddin joined Wiretap Crash.\n\nCaruana and Reilly re-connected as friends and shortly afterwards began talking about a potential the Movielife reunion. The band subsequently began rehearsing in December 2014, performing their first shows since 2011 in New York City at Irving Plaza in February 2015. Asked whether a new album would be released, Caruana said he would \"never rule that out\". The Movielife performed several additional shows in the US later in the year, including an appearance at Today's Mixtape Festival, as well as a tour of the UK in June. In March 2016, Caruana revealed that the band were in the process of writing new material. The following month, the band released \"Future Feeling (Afraid of Drugs)\" as a single. In 2017, the group performed at Slam Dunk Festival in the UK. All promotional materials posted to the band's Twitter after the 2016 Presidential election feature only Brett Romnes, Brandon and Vinnie, implying they are the only current members of the band.

Arizona, 536 U.S. 584 (2002), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court applied the rule of \"Apprendi v. New Jersey\", to capital sentencing schemes, holding that the Sixth Amendment requires a jury to find the aggravating factors necessary for imposing the death penalty. \"Ring\" overruled a portion of \"Walton v. Arizona\", which had rejected that contention.\n\nOn November 28, 1994, an armored car parked in front of Arrowhead Mall in Glendale, Arizona, was robbed. The driver, John Magoch, was shot in the head as he opened the door to smoke, and died almost instantly. One of the robbers then drove the van to a church in nearby Sun City, where they made off with $562,000 in cash and $271,000 in personal checks. An informant tipped the police off to Timothy Ring and two of his friends, who had recently made expensive purchases such as a new truck. Police eventually discovered that Ring was the ringleader of the operation. Ring was later charged with capital felony murder under Arizona law.\n\nThe jury eventually convicted Ring of felony murder, but Ring could not be sentenced to death without further findings, and Arizona law provided that the judge alone would make the findings. After a sentencing hearing, at which Ring's accomplices testified, the judge found that two aggravating factors applied: that Ring had committed the murder in expectation of pecuniary gain and that he had committed the murder in an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner. Although he found that Ring had a \"minimal\" criminal record, the judge concluded that it did not outweigh the aggravating factors and sentenced Ring to death.\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice Ginsburg began with an important characterization of Arizona's capital sentencing scheme. Based solely on the jury's verdict that Ring was guilty of first-degree murder, the greatest sentence for which Ring was eligible was life in prison. To satisfy the jury-trial requirement of the Sixth Amendment as interpreted by \"Apprendi\", additional factfinding was required. However, in \"Walton\", the Court had expressly held that Arizona's capital sentencing scheme was not subject to such a requirement.\n\nThat characterization all but dictated the result. Prior decisions, including \"Walton\", had distinguished between the \"elements\" of a crime and \"sentencing factors.\" The Sixth Amendment required a jury to find elements but allowed a judge to determine sentencing factors. Under \"Walton\", the aggravating factors were \"sentencing factors\" because they were the modern vehicle by which judges expressed their traditional sentencing discretion in capital cases. However, after \"Apprendi\", which built on \"Jones v. United States\", , the relevant inquiry was \"one not of form, but of effect.\" If a particular fact, whether it was called an \"element\" or a \"sentencing factor,\" exposed the defendant to a greater punishment, then the Court said that the Sixth Amendment required a jury to find it. The Court found no principled basis for exempting capital cases from \"Apprendi\"'s general rule.\n\nNoting the disparity between Justice Breyer's continued rejection of \"Apprendi\" and concurrence in \"Ring\", Justice Antonin Scalia added:\n\nJustice Sandra Day O'Connor argued that the Court's decision would have serious consequences, opening up a flood of litigation from death-row inmates and creating uncertainty in the laws of nine other states that employed either total or partial judicial factfinding in death sentences.\n\n"}

Many music enthusiasts consider the group unique among girl groups because the members played their own instruments. Originally called Pretty and Pink, the band started playing 60's music at Rock Ma Jazz ( a bar owned by RJ Jacinto) and eventually played 80's music from the Gogo's, Bangles, B-52's, etc. at different bars such as Par Avion, Kalye, Fat Tuesdays, and Cosmo.\n\nIn 1995 a self-produced demo garnered interest from various record labels and the group changed its name to Prettier Than Pink. Neo Records (now VIVA Records) eventually signed them up. After five months, an eponymous debut album went Gold. The single \"\"Cool Ka Lang\",\" written and composed by the band's lead singer and founding member Lei Bautista, reached no. 1 on the OPM charts.\n\nBy 1997, Prettier Than Pink had undergone a line-up transformation, with Bautista remaining as the group's leader. Their second album, \"UnPink\", took a less commercial turn; but the release received regional airplay with \"Baby\". In 1998, Lei Bautista was nominated for an Awit award for \"Baby.\"\n\nBautista left for the U.S. shortly thereafter, reviving Prettier Than Pink in America as a new wave-styled group.

This is currently one of the very few populated areas of the Greater Toronto Area where the Trans Canada Highway passes near, thus also making this the closest point from the highway to the City of Toronto at apart.\n\nSunderland has a community of small businesses that focus primarily on the needs of surrounding rural families. Downtown Sunderland also has a number of restaurants, drug store, dog groomer, grocery and bottle store, hardware store, an art gallery, a museum (Sunderland & District Historical Society), bank, post office and a branch of the Royal Canadian Legion.\n\nThe land that the Town of Sunderland was built on, was granted in the early 1820s to United Empire Loyalists. (Sir Isaac Brock's Estate was given of free land in the vicinity). Sunderland slowly grew around the Brock Hotel - a popular overnight stop for travelers that was owned by Lorenzo Jones. The first post office was called \"Brock\" and was run by Andrew Hill; it was located just north at the modern junction of Highway 12 and 7th Concession.\n\nSunderland was originally called \"Jones Corners\", as both Arch and Lorenzo Jones owned property in what became the downtown core. They produced a town plan and it was renamed Sunderland by 1871 when the Toronto - Lindsay Line of the Toronto and Nipissing Railway was built. The town's population grew rapidly during this time. (Vroomanton, a larger village to the west was bypassed by the railway, and its population subsequently dropped).\n\nSunderland's name is thought to come from Charles Spencer, the Third \"Earl of Sunderland\" in England. He was the \"Secretary of State\", and he helped move Palatine German families to London and then, with Queen Anne's aid, to Ireland in the early 18th century. Many of the men in these families had ancestors who fought for Britain in the American War of Independence in 1776 and in the War of 1812 in the New World, and so, in 1818, after the wars, for their efforts, they were granted free land in what was to become Brock Township, Ontario. These early Palatine settlers included surnames like: Shier, Baker, Bagshaw, Switzer, Lowe, St. John, Lodwick, Brethour and Doble.\n\nHurricane Hazel struck Sunderland in 1954, and another storm in 1957 destroyed the skating arena and tore out many trees. \nAlthough the railway ceased operations through Sunderland in the 1980s, the town has remained vibrant, due in no small part to its close proximity to Toronto, Lindsay, and Newmarket.\n\nThe region around Sunderland is rolling farmland, with dense first-growth deciduous forests and rich agricultural soil. Sunderland displays many typical traits of a temperate humid climate. Its altitude and proximity to the Canadian Shield allows for much deciduous forests with beginning sprouts of coniferous trees.\n\nSunderland has one public school, Sunderland Public School, which celebrated its 50-year anniversary on 20 October 2007. The nearest high school is Brock High School, located west of Cannington.\n\nSunderland is home of the Brock Minor Hockey Association and the Sunderland Skating Club www.sunderlandskatingclub.com\n\nSunderland hosts the annual Maple Syrup Festival at the beginning of April each year. The town also hosts the annual Sunderland Agricultural Fall Fair in September of each year. This fair has been held annually since the 1850s and is the longest continuously running fair in Ontario. As well, Sunderland hosts Orange Parades with the Orange Order, usually during the month of July.\n\nSunderland has been home to a local Lions Club since 1955. As of 2011 the club has approximately 60 members which puts it amongst the largest in its Lions International District known as A-16. The club runs various fundraisers throughout the year such as a Car Draw and Beach Volleyball tournament as well as annually hosting a Blue Rodeo concert. All profits from these events are put back into service projects and used for the purpose of community betterment. One of the club's largest service projects is the annual Sunderland Lions Music Festival which is held over 3 weeks, beginning in mid-February.\n\n\n\n\nThere are about 30 homes on the extreme south-west corner of Brock Township with (rural route) Sunderland mailing addresses and a 905 North American area code.\n\n"}

The Upper East regional capital is Bolgatanga, sometimes referred to as Bolga. Other major towns in the region include Navrongo, Paga, Bawku and Zebilla.\n\nThe Upper East region is located in the north-eastern corner of Ghana, precisely located in the Kingdom of Dagbon, and bordered by Burkina Faso to the north and Togo to the east. It lies between longitude 0° and 1° West, and latitudes 10° 30′N and 11°N. The region shares boundaries with Burkina Faso to the north, Togo to the east, Upper West Region to the west, and the Northern Region to the south. The Upper East region is divided into 15 districts, each headed by a district chief executive.\n\n\n\n\nThe region plays host to many festivals throughout the year, most of which are either to bring a good planting season or celebrate the harvest.\n\n\nThe center of population of the Upper East Region is located in its capital of Bolgatanga.\n\nThe population is primarily rural (79%) and scattered in dispersed settlements. The rural population was 87.1 percent in 1984 and 84.3% in 2000. There was, thus, a 2.8 percentage point reduction in the rural share of the population between 1984 and 2000 and a further 5.3 percent reduction between 2000 and 2010.\n\nWith only 21 per cent of the population living in urban areas, the region is the least urbanized in Ghana.

Krauss inaugurated the genre to allow for a juxtaposition of the works of Roland Barthes and Jacques Derrida. Krauss argues the paraliterary is 'the space of debate, quotation, partisanship, betrayal, reconciliation; but it is not the space of unity, coherence, or resolution that we think of as constituting the work of literature.' She links the paraliterary to postmodern literature, noting 'it is not surprising that the medium of a postmodernist literature should be the critical text wrought into a paraliterary form.'\n\nOn the term \"paraliterature\", Ursula K.

He was the oldest of three siblings and at age fourteen his father died. As a young man he studied law at the University of Athens and worked in the Athens court of first instance. He was a member of Panellinios sports club, a dedicated athlete, and pursued running.\n\nOn March 22, 1896, Greece held the first modern Panhellenic Games. The main purpose of the games was to select the team that would compete in the first Modern Olympic Games later the same year. All participants were members of Greek sports clubs. Vasilakos had a reputation as a strong long-distance runner. He won the marathon race with a time of 3 hours and 18 minutes.\n\nVasilakos was one of seventeen athletes to start the Olympic race on April 10, 1896. He finished in second place, behind Spiridon Louis, with a time of 3:06.03 as one of only nine finishers. Both races were on 40 kilometre courses rather than the now-standard 42.195 kilometres.\n\nAfter the Olympics, Vasilakos helped establish, and participated in, racewalking in Greece. In 1900 he won the first Greek 1000 metres walking race and participated in several races between 1900 and 1906.\n\nVasilakos studied law and went on to become a customs director in the Greek Ministry of Finance. He had a reputation for honesty and integrity. In 1960 he was awarded the Gold Cross of the Order of Phoenix by King Paul of Greece. Annual marathon races in Olympia commemorate Vasilakos. He was married to wife Helen. He died in Athens in 1964.\n\nThe 2011 book titled \"Ο Χαρίλαος Βασιλάκος και η αμφιλεγόμενη πρωτιά του Σπύρου Λούη\", which translates from Greek to \"Charilaos Vasilakos and the controversial lead of Spyros Louis\", presents a biography of Vasilakos and signs which challenge the 1896 Olympic race results.\n\n"}

The society sponsored lectures, concerts, publications, and exhibitions of modern art, including the International Exhibition of Modern Art at the Brooklyn Museum in 1926. Between 1920 and 1940 they held 80 exhibitions showing mostly Cubist and abstract art. Their galleries in their \"first modest headquarters\" were at 19 East 47th Street.\n\nMan Ray picked the name \"Société Anonyme\", having seen it in French magazines, but knowing little French, assumed it referred to some anonymous society. It actually means \"Corporation\", but Duchamp thought it a fine name and later while the legal paperwork was being written up the \"Inc.\" was added, making its English translation, \"Corporation, Inc.\".\n\nThe Société gave Alexander Archipenko, Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Fernand Léger, Jacques Villon, and Louis Eilshemius their first one-man shows in America, helped to familiarize American viewers with the little known work of Piet Mondrian and Kurt Schwitters and sponsored traveling exhibitions, lectures by artists and critics, and other special events. It also put on this country's first comprehensive survey of postwar international art, at the Brooklyn Museum in 1926, three years before the Museum of Modern Art came into existence. Katherine Dreier deeply resented this upstart rival, whose wealthy backers, she felt, had stolen her mission and her ideas and even her name -- the Société Anonyme's subtitle was \"Museum of Modern Art.\" In truth however, Dreier's tireless idealism could not make up for her lack of significant financial support. The Société Anonyme's exhibition rooms were too small, but Dreier's attempts to find larger quarters kept breaking down because the funds, which came mainly from her and her two sisters, were insufficient. Her society -- as time went on it became more and more a one-woman operation -- could and did claim precedence, nevertheless, as the first museum anywhere in the world that was devoted exclusively to modern art. \n\nThe Société's headquarters in New Jersey closed in 1928, but Dreier continued to organize events, and accumulate artwork to add to the Société Anonyme's collection. Dreier donated the collection to the Yale University Art Gallery in 1941.\n\nOn April 30, 1950, the 30th anniversary of the Société Anonyme's first exhibition, Dreier and Duchamp hosted a dinner at the New Haven Lawn Club, where they formally dissolved the organization. \n\n\n"}

The German Football Association ( or ) is the sport's national governing body, with 6.6 million members (roughly eight percent of the population) organized in over 26,000 football clubs. There is a league system, with the Bundesliga, 2. Bundesliga and 3. Liga on top. The winner of the Bundesliga is crowned the German football champion. Additionally, there are national cup competitions, most notably the DFB-Pokal (German Cup) and DFL-Supercup (German Supercup).\n\nThe Germany national football team has won four FIFA World Cups (1954, 1974, 1990, 2014), being the joint second most successful nation in the tournament only surpassed by Brazil. It also holds a record (tied with Spain) three UEFA European Championships (1972, 1980, 1996), and won the FIFA Confederations Cup in 2017. The Germany women's national football team has won two FIFA Women's World Cups (2003, 2007) and a record eight UEFA European Women's Championships (1989, 1991, 1995, 1997, 2001, 2005, 2009, 2013), as well as a gold medal in the Summer Olympics in 2016. Germany is the only nation that has won both the men's and women's World Cup. No team has more combined men's and women's World Cup championships, and only the United States has won more combined men's and women's regional/continental championships (USA 12 in CONCACAF, Germany 11 in UEFA Euro). Germany was the host of the 1974 FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 1988, the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2006 FIFA World Cup and the 1989 UEFA European Women's Championship, 1995 UEFA European Women's Championship, 2001 UEFA European Women's Championship, and 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup. Germany will host the UEFA Euro 2024 after beating out rival Turkey by 8 votes of 12-4.\n\nThe first football match arguably took place in Braunschweig in 1874. Two schoolteachers, August Hermann and Konrad Koch, initiated the first match after Hermann had obtained a round football from England. In 1875, Koch published the first German version of the rules of football, although Koch's version of the game still closely resembled Rugby football.\n\nThe Dresden English Football Club is considered the first modern football club in Germany. It was founded in 1874 by Englishmen living and working around Dresden. In the following 20 years the game achieved a growing popularity. Football clubs were founded in Berlin, Hamburg and Karlsruhe.\n\nOn 28 January 1900, representatives from 86 football clubs from German-speaking areas in and outside the German Empire met in the restaurant \"Mariengarten\" in Leipzig, founding the DFB. The founding meeting was led by E. J. Kirmse, chairman of the \"Leipziger Fussball Verband (Leipzig Football Association)\". Ferdinand Hueppe, representing the DFC Prag, was elected first president of the DFB.\n\nAlready some years before 1900, associations like the \"Bund Deutscher Fussballspieler\" or \"Deutscher Fussball und Cricket-Bund\" were founded, but they were limited to smaller areas of the German Empire, in those cases to areas around Berlin. The first championship beyond municipal areas was held in 1898 from the \"Verband Sueddeutscher Fussball-Vereine (Association of South German football clubs)\", later affiliated with the DFB.\n\nThe German national football team represents Germany in international football competitions since 1908. It is controlled by the German Football Association DFB, the governing body of football in Germany.\n\nThe German national football team played its first post-WWI match on the 27th of June 1920 in Zürich against Switzerland, which the Swiss team won 1:4.\n\nClub football was centered in the region of Franconia during the 1920s as 1. FC Nürnberg and SpVgg Fürth dominated the competition.\n\nIn 1919, the proletarian Arbeiter-Turnbund was renamed Arbeiter-Turn- und Sportbund (ATSB). The name change especially reflected the incorporation of football into the federation, which promoted leftist political views and attempted to break the monopolisation of football under the umbrella of the DFB.\n\nWith the rise of Nazism, left-leaning sporting associations such as the ATSB and Rotsport were banned. Communist sporting officials such as Ernst Grube, Reichstag deputy and head of Rotsport, were murdered in concentration camps. The DFB integrated as \"Fachamt Reichsfußball\" into the National Socialist League of the Reich for Physical Exercise. From 1933 to 1945 the highest level of play in German football was organised in 16 Gauligen, whose winners qualified for the finals in the German championship, held at the end of season.\n\nAfter the war, Germany was occupied in three states. The DFB and its team continued in what was called West Germany, while the Saarland and East Germany fielded separate teams for some years.\n\nThe FIFA World Cup 1974 was staged in West Germany, and both German teams were drawn in the same group in the first round. Meeting on 22 June 1974 in a politically charged match in Hamburg, East Germany beat West Germany 1–0, on a goal by Jürgen Sparwasser. Both German teams advanced to the second round anyway. The GDR team was eliminated there, while the DFB team eventually went on to win the tournament.\n\nIn the year of German reunification (1990), West Germany secured its third World Cup as West and East Germans celebrated together. The present-day German national team is identical to the team informally called West Germany from 1949 to 1990 team, as the German Football Association was again recognized by FIFA after WW2. Nothing changed in 1990 except enlarged membership due to the access of East German states and players, thus the continuity in the German logo and uniform style as well as references to Germany's four World Cup and three European Cup titles. Thus, all references to a \"former West German team\" are considered by many as false - according to the DFB, this team still exists, called Germany.\n\nGermany's greatest triumphs since 1990 has been the 2014 World Championship in Brazil, and the 1996 European Championship secured in England with players from both the former West, including (Jürgen Klinsmann as captain) and East (Matthias Sammer) as anchor of the defence.\n\nThe greatest success for German team in the new millennium has been their conquest of the 2014 FIFA World Cup. They had also finished in second place to Brazil at the 2002 World Cup in South Korea and Japan and second place at the 2008 European Championship. There was also a third place at the 2006 World Cup in Germany and in addition another third place at World Cup 2010. Germany's women have achieved even greater success, winning both the 2003 FIFA Women's World Cup in the US and the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup in China.\n\nThe national association is the German Football Association (or Deutscher Fußball-Bund) headquartered in Frankfurt.\n\nThe DFB was founded in 1900 in Leipzig, by the representatives of 86 clubs. Today, the association has some 26,000 member clubs which field 170,000 teams with over 2 million players: these numbers include 870,000 female members and 8,600 women's teams. With over six million members, the DFB is the world's largest sports federation.\n\nThe German national football team represents Germany in international football competitions since 1908. It is controlled by the German Football Association (DFB), the governing body of football in Germany. They have won four FIFA World Cups and have been runners up on four occasions.\n\nSince the 1954 World Cup, the German national team has been outfitted by the German firm adidas. For home games, the German team wears white jerseys, black shorts and white socks in honour of the Prussian colours. Along with black both red and gold, the other two colours of the German flag, have been included in the strip over the years.\n\nTraditionally, the Germans have worn green jerseys, white shorts and green socks as their alternate strip. In recent years, however, the Germans have changed their away strip to grey in 2002–2003, black in 2004 and recently to red. The Germans wore red as their alternate colour in the 2006 World Cup.\n\nThe German national team during the 2006 World Cup was coached by former captain Jürgen Klinsmann. Since 12 July 2006, former Assistant Coach Joachim Löw has coached the national team. Its current captain is Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer.\n\nThe German women's national football team, also organised by the DFB, are two-time world champions, having won the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2003 under past coach Tina Theune-Meyer and 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup under current coach Silvia Neid. They are the first women's team to have successfully defended a World Cup. They have also won eight UEFA Women's Championships (1989, 1991, 1995, 1997, 2001, 2005, 2009, 2013), which includes six consecutive titles. Germany is the only nation to have won both the men's and women's World Cup and European Championship.\n\nThe Germany women's team are also the first to have won a World Cup at senior level, either for men or women, without conceding a single goal, having done so in 2007. Nadine Angerer was the goalkeeper who managed this feat.\n\nThe national teams play in various stadiums throughout Germany. The cities of Düsseldorf, Munich, Dortmund and Berlin are some of the more popular locations.\n\nThe Germany national football team has won four FIFA World Cups and have been the runners up on four other occasions. The four World Cup championships are commemorated by the four stars above the German national team logo on the team's jerseys. Germany hosted the World Cups in 1974 and in 2006.\n\nThe women's national team has won two FIFA Women's World Cups, commemorated by two stars above the crest on their jerseys. Germany hosted the 2011 Women's World Cup.\n\nThe Wankdorf Stadion in Bern saw 60,000 people cram inside to watch the Final between West Germany and Hungary, a rematch of a first-round game, which Hungary had won 8–3. In response to his team's earlier thrashing at the hands of the Hungarians, legendary West German coach Sepp Herberger made key tactical adjustments in his team's lineup prior to the Final. Shortly before the match, it had started raining - in Germany this was dubbed \"Fritz-Walter-Wetter\" (Fritz Walter Weather) because the German team captain Fritz Walter was said to play his best in rainy weather.\n\nThe Final saw the legendary Ferenc Puskás playing even though he was not fully fit. Despite this he put his team ahead after only 6 minutes and, with Zoltán Czibor adding another two minutes later, it seemed destined that the pre-tournament favourites would take the title.\n\nHowever, with a goal from Max Morlock on the tenth minute and Helmut Rahn on the nineteenth before halftime, the tide began to turn in the Germans' favor. The second half saw misses from the Hungarian team as well as a disallowed goal from Puskás with 2 minutes left.\n\nRahn then scored again to make the score 3–2. As he was scoring the goal, the popular German reporter Herbert Zimmermann gave the most famous German piece of commentary of all time - \"Rahn schiesst - TOR!\" (\"Rahn shoots - GOAL!\") - while the Hungarian reporter burst into tears. The game would become known as the \"Das Wunder von Bern\" (the \"Miracle of Bern\") in German lore and would be the basis for a successful movie released in 2003.\n\nThe FIFA World Cup 1974 was held in West Germany.\n\nLed by legendary libero Franz Beckenbauer, keeper Sepp Maier, playmaker Paul Breitner, and strikers Uli Hoeneß and \"Der Bomber\" Gerd Müller (Germany's all-time leading scorer with 68 goals in 62 games), Germany won its second World Cup by defeating the Netherlands in the final, 2–1, behind goals by Breitner and Müller. The Final was famous for the battle between Kaiser Franz (Beckenbauer) and King Johann (Cruyff).\n\nThe tournament marked the first time that the current trophy, the FIFA World Cup, was awarded. The previous trophy, the Jules Rimet Trophy, was won for the third time by Brazil in 1970 and awarded permanently to the Brazilians.\n\nIn a tournament which included a memorable clash with rival the Netherlands, Germany defeated Argentina, 1–0, on an Andreas Brehme penalty kick, to win its third World Cup title. With its third title (and three second-place finishes), West Germany became the most successful World Cup nation for 4 years, until Brazil won their 4th Championship in 1994. West German team manager Franz Beckenbauer became the second footballer, after Mario Zagallo of Brazil, to become World Champion as a player (in 1974) and as team manager. In doing so, Beckenbauer also became the first captain of a winning team to later manage a winning squad.\n\nThe 2003 FIFA Women's World Cup was held in the United States (changed from China due to the SARS epidemic) and won by Germany, who defeated Sweden by 2–1 in extra time. Earlier in the semifinals they had disposed of the defending champions and hosts, the United States, 3–0.\n\nGermany hosted the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Thirty-two nations competed in the tournament, with matches played in a dozen cities ranging from Hamburg in the north to Munich in the south; Leipzig was the only former East city to hold matches (the matches at Berlin were held at former West Berliner territory). The opening match (Germany vs Costa Rica) was held on 9 June in the Allianz Arena in Munich, with Germany defeating Costa Rica 4–2. The final match took place in Olympiastadion Berlin one month later between Italy and France. The match was drawn 1–1 at full-time and after extra time. Zinedine Zidane was controversially sent off for headbutting Italy's Marco Materazzi with 10 minutes to go before the match went into penalties. France lost to Italy in the shootout 5–3.\n\nGermany defeated Portugal 3–1 in the third place play off at the Gottlieb-Daimler-Stadion in Stuttgart on 8 July. Miroslav Klose won the Golden Boot for the highest goalscorer of the tournament with 5 goals. Lukas Podolski received the Best Young Player Award.\n\nThe 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup was held in China and won by Germany, who became the first women's team to successfully defend the title. In the opening match in Shanghai, Germany beat Argentina by a record 11–0. Nadine Angerer, the key goalkeeper, went unbeaten the entire tournament. In the final at Shanghai, Germany beat Brazil, 2–0.\n\nBirgit Prinz became the all-time top World Cup goalscorer with 14 goals total.\n\nGermany finished third for the second consecutive time, behind Spain and the Netherlands. Germany was the team that scored the most goals in the FIFA World Cup 2010, with three 4-goal hauls. They lost to only two teams, Serbia and Spain. Thomas Müller won the Golden Shoe and Best Young Player award.\n\nThe 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup was held in Germany. The competition kicked off with two matches on 26 June—the first in Sinsheim pitting France and Nigeria, followed by the official opening match in Berlin featuring Germany and Canada. Germany went on to win Group A without dropping a point, but lost in the quarterfinals to eventual champion Japan.\n\nGermany emerged champions of the 2014 World Cup, defeating Argentina 1–0 thanks to a memorable goal by 22-year-old Mario Götze. In the run-up to the finals, Germany eviscerated Brazil 7–1 in their semifinal match, breaking several World Cup records. Miroslav Klose also scored his 16th World Cup goal in this match to become the highest scoring player in World Cup history.\n\nThe 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup was held in Canada. Germany won Group B on goal difference over Norway. In the knockout rounds, they defeated Sweden in the round of 16 and France in the quarterfinals. They would ultimately be eliminated for the second straight World Cup by the eventual champion, dropping their semifinal to the United States. In the third-place game, Germany lost to England 1–0 on an extra-time penalty.\n\nGermany's Célia Šašić won the tournament's Golden Boot. Šašić and the USA's Carli Lloyd had 6 goals and were level on the first tiebreaker of assists, with 1 each; Šašić won on the second tiebreaker of fewer minutes played.\n\nGermany have won three European Championship (1972, 1980 and 1996). The German team also placed second in the 1976, 1992 and 2008 championships.\n\nIn Euro 1972, a young West German team that would go on to win the World Cup two years later captured the first of its three European Cup titles. In the two-leg quarter-finals, Germany first crushed England, 3–1, in Wembley Stadium on 29 April 1972, then closed the door by earning a 0–0 draw in Berlin. The Germans then advanced to the finals in Belgium, where they defeated the host nation, 2–1, in the semifinal and the Soviet Union, 3–0, in the final to capture their first major championship since the Miracle of Bern.\n\n\"This is the best team we ever had,\" stated former coach Helmut Schön in the hour of his triumph. In admiration of the German effort, the French L’Equipe wrote: \"Brussels witnessed the rehabilitation of attacking football.\" \"The Times\" noted: \"Germany has the most talented football team on the continent.\"\n\nOnly 8 years passed before the Germans secured their next title. After defeating Czechoslovakia, Netherlands, and Greece in the opening round, Germany got past Belgium, 2–1, in the final through two goals by Horst Hrubesch. This tournament would be the first of many for midfielder Lothar Matthäus, who would retire after Euro 2000 as Germany's most capped (experienced) player with 150 national team appearances.\n\nIn 1996, Germany won perhaps its most memorable European Championship and its first major championship since reunification. Led by captain Jürgen Klinsmann on offense and Matthias Sammer on defense, the Germans easily defeated the Czech Republic, 2–0, and Russia, 3–0, in the first round. A hard-fought 0–0 draw against Italy completed the first round and saw Germany through to the quarterfinals, where it defeated Croatia 2–1.\n\nThis victory set the stage for a classic battle against England, again in Wembley Stadium, in the tournament semifinals. After England jumped in front with a goal in the third minute, the Germans - playing without injured captain Klinsmann - fought back and equalized behind a Stefan Kuntz goal in the 16. minute. Both teams fought through the remainder of regulation and two sudden-death 15-minute overtime periods without scoring, leading to a dramatic penalty kick shootout. In the shootout, German keeper Andreas Köpke held England's sixth attempt, allowing Andreas Möller to stun the Wembley faithful and send Germany through to the final.\n\nIn the final, Germany fell behind the same Czech squad it had defeated earlier in the tournament on a controversial (bad) penalty kick decision. Nonetheless, the Germans displayed their usual fighting spirit and tied the game on substitute Oliver Bierhoff's 73. minute header. Regulation ended in a 1–1 tie. Five minutes into the first sudden-death overtime, it was again Oliver Bierhoff who led the Germans to victory with his historic golden goal. Largely because of his outstanding defensive efforts in the tournament, Matthias Sammer was voted \"Europe's Player of the Year\" after the finals.\n\nIn 2024, Germany will host the UEFA Euro 2024, it will be taking place in 10 cities, Berlin, Cologne, Dortmund, Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, Gelsenkirchen, Hamburg, Leipzig, Munich and Stuttgart. The opening match will take place at the Allianz Arena in Munich and the final will take place at the Olympiastadion in Berlin.\n\nThe country's premier football competition is the 18-team Bundesliga. Bayern München has won a record of twenty-eight Bundesliga championships since the formation of the league in 1963. Hamburger SV was the only team to have played in every Bundesliga season until 2017/18 season when they were relegated for the first time in club history. The second-tier league is known as the 2. Bundesliga. A 3. Liga, to be run directly by the DFB instead of the DFB-affiliated German Football League (DFL, from the German \"Deutsche Fußball Liga\") which operates the two \"Bundesligen\", was introduced in 2008.\n\nThe German Cup (German: \"DFB-Pokal\", Deutscher Fußball Bund-Pokal) is a national football tournament held annually since 1952. It is the second most important national title in German football after the Bundesliga championship.\n\nEach football club which participates in the German football league system is entitled to enter the tournament. The clubs of the lower leagues play in regional qualification rounds, with the winners joining the teams of the Bundesliga and 2.Bundesliga in the main round of the tournament in the following year. Each elimination is determined by a single game held on the ground of one of the two participating teams. Since 1985 the final has been held each year at the Olympic Stadium in Berlin. \"Bayern Munich\" has won the cup a record 18 times.\n\nThe Tschammer-Pokal was the predecessor to today's cup competition. It was introduced in 1934–35 and contested until 1944.\n\nDivided after World War II, Germany had two cup competitions with East German sides competing for the East German Cup (German: \"FDGB-Pokal\", Freier Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund-Pokal or Free German Trade Union Federation Cup). Introduced in 1949, the cup was contested annually until 1991 when the tournament was ended in the wake of German re-unification and the merger of the football leagues of the two Germanys.\n\nUnder current co-efficient rankings, Germany is guaranteed at least four UEFA Champions League spots and three UEFA Europa League spots. Clubs finishing first, second, third and fourth in the Bundesliga are put into the group stage of the Champions League. The fifth and sixth place finishers enter the Europa League, respectively in the group stage and second qualifying round. The winner of the DFB-Pokal also enters the group stage of the Europa League. However, if the winner of the Cup has already been granted a place in the Champions League through league standings, then the team placed seventh in the Bundesliga is granted a place in the second qualifying round of the Europa League.\n\nThere are many foreign football players in the German professional football leagues. In November 2009, there were 249 foreign players in the 1. Bundesliga, or 45% of all players. In the 2. Bundesliga, there are 145 foreign players, with a ratio of 31%. In the 3. Liga, the foreigner percentage is 15%.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2110621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2110621", "title": "The Redwalls", "text": "The Redwalls\n\nThe Redwalls were a two-member rock band from Deerfield, Illinois, in suburban Chicago.\n\nFormed in 2001 by brothers Logan and Justin Baren, The Redwalls were originally a British Invasion-inspired cover band dubbed The Pages. Still in high school, singer/guitarist Logan, his bassist brother Justin, lead guitarist Andrew Langer, and drummer Jordan Kozer played their first show at the local jazz club Pops for Champagne. Soon after, The Pages began writing original material and earned a regular booking at the local Evanston club Nevin's Live, with the venue's booking manager Mitchell Marlow, who eventually quit his post to manage the band full-time. With the help of Marlow's longtime friend and former Wilco drummer Ken Coomer, the Pages' demo recording made its way to Capitol Records' A&R Julian Raymond, and while in the midst of working on their debut LP for the Chicago-based indie label Undertow, the band signed to Capitol in mid-2003. The band changed their name to The Redwalls at the label's request due to a conflict regarding an earlier Capitol signing known as Pages, who were better known as Mr. Mister. The band finished recording in 2003, however after completing sessions for the album, Kozer quit the group to attend college and Ben Greeno signed on to play drums. The Redwalls' debut album \"Universal Blues,\" was later released on November 18, 2003.\n\nNearly two years after \"Universal Blues\" the band would release their second studio album (first under Capitol Records), titled \"De Nova,\" on June 21, 2005. Shortly after, The Redwalls were invited to join Oasis on their Summer 2005 UK tour and were also featured at Lollapalooza in 2005 & 2006. In 2007, The Redwalls finished recording material for their third studio album, however before its release, the band was dropped from Capitol Records. They quickly signed with indie label MAD Dragon Records and their album \"The Redwalls\" was later released on October 23, 2007. In addition, their song \"Build a Bridge\" was featured on an AT&T commercial. By 2008, the band had achieved moderate success and began their highly successful US tour, which culminated with performances on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\" and \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" on April 10, 2008. In the latter part of 2008, The Redwalls once again began touring in the UK, this time supporting The Zutons. However, lead guitarist Andrew Langer, as well as drummer Rob Jensen, left the group to focus on other musical projects. Studio musician Duane Leinan joined the band in 2010 playing bass guitar supporting the tour and in the studio.\n\nThe Redwalls released their debut UK single \"Memories\" on January 5, 2009. Shortly after, drummer Rob Jensen announced his departure from the group to focus on other musical projects. In regards to Jensen's departure, Justin stated through the band's MySpace,\nThe Redwalls were winners in the 8th Annual Independent Music Awards for best College Record Label Album of the year and the song \"Modern Diet\" was nominated for Pop/Rock song of the year\n\n\n\n"}

He was Prebendary of Sandiacre from 3 February 1297 until, presumably, 1308, when he married. He was also King's Secretary, and he served variously as keeper of the Great Seal and controller of the wardrobe (for Edward I). He also served as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1305–1306, and as a royal judge from 1309 onwards.\n\nOn the chancellor, John de Langton, going to Rome in reference to the action of the pope in annulling his election to the see of Ely, which the king had approved, the seal was delivered to Benstede, who almost immediately transferred it to William de Hamilton, afterwards (1305) Lord Chancellor. We find him again mentioned as having charge of the seal during the interval which elapsed between William de Hamilton's appointment as Chancellor (29 December 1304) and its delivery to him (16 January 1305).\n\nIn the parliament of 1305, he was one of twenty-one English members appointed to confer with the same number of Scotch representatives concerning the best means of promoting the stability of Scotland. In the same year he was made chancellor of the exchequer. This office he held until 20 August 1307, when John de Sandale was appointed in his place. In June 1307, he was entrusted by the Prince of Wales with the presentation of a petition from the Earl of Ulster and John and Eustace le Poer, praying that the king would assign such other justices in place of those already appointed as would redress certain grievances of which they complained. In the following year he was appointed keeper of the wardrobe, and in 1309 justice of the common pleas. \nIn 1315, he was sent to Northumberland with authority to summon the barons, knights, and men-at-arms of the northern counties to meet him to concert measures for securing the border against the incursions of the Scots, and in the following year was despatched on a mission to the court of the pope for the purpose of ‘expediting certain arduous matters touching the realm of Scotland and the said pope,’ but was recalled when he had got no further than Dover. He was assigned as one of the justices for the county of Hertford in 1317.\n\nIn 1318, he acted as one of the envoys empowered to treat for peace with Robert Bruce, and in the following year was placed on a special commission to assess damages sustained by certain subjects of the Count of Flanders in 1307. In the same year (1319) he was sent, with the Bishop of Hereford and two other envoys, to Rome to urge on the pope the canonisation of Thomas de Cantilupe, bishop of Hereford in the reign of Henry III. Between 1301 and 1303 we find him in attendance upon the king in Scotland. In 1302 the king granted him the right of holding two markets weekly and one fair yearly at his manor of Ermington in Devonshire, with other privileges, and in the following year he obtained a similar grant for his manor of Bennington, Hertfordshire. In 1306 he went the northern circuit as one of the commission of trailbaston. He was appointed justice of the common bench on the accession of Edward II (1307), the king in the same year granting him the right of fortifying his house called Rosemont at Eye, near Westminster, with walls of lime and stone. Next year he attended the king in Scotland, and was also despatched with Roger Savage to Philip of France to arrange a personal interview between the two kings, which took place at Pontoise.\n\nBetween 1311 and 1321 he was regularly summoned to parliament as a justice. In 1312 we find him present on two occasions at the exchequer with the barons; but there is no reason to infer from this, with Dugdale, that he was ever regularly appointed a baron. He was probably present merely as one of the council. In 1314–15 he was employed in Scotland upon affairs of state, the nature of which does not very clearly appear. Fines were regularly levied before him between 1312 and 1320. In the latter year he resigned, William de Hale being appointed to succeed him. \nIn 1322, he was returned by the sheriff as one of the inhabitants of Hertfordshire liable to military service, and summoned to render the same, being described as a banneret. His death probably took place in 1323, as his estates are entered amongst the escheats of the seventeenth year of Edward II's reign (July 1323–July 1324).\n\nHe was twice married, the name of his first wife being Isabella, and that of his second Petronilla. At the date of his death he was possessed of estates in Devonshire, Middlesex, Hertfordshire, Essex, Wiltshire, and Hampshire. His wife Petronilla and a son, Edmund, thirteen years old, survived him. Petronilla was life-tenant of a portion of the estates in right of dower. She died in 1342. The last male representative of the family, Sir William de Benstede, died in 1485.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2110658", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2110658", "title": "LTP induction", "text": "LTP induction\n\nThe induction of NMDA receptor-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) in chemical synapses in the brain occurs via a fairly straightforward mechanism. A substantial and rapid rise in calcium ion concentration inside the postsynaptic cell (or more specifically, within the dendritic spine) is most possibly all that is required to induce LTP. But the mechanism of calcium delivery to the postsynaptic cell in inducing LTP is more complicated.\n\nThe AMPA receptor (AMPAR) is the engine that drives excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). While some forms of the AMPAR can conduct calcium, most AMPARs found in the neocortex do not. The AMPAR, upon binding two glutamate molecules, undergoes a conformational change that resembles the opening of a clam shell. This conformational change opens an ion channel within the AMPAR protein structure that allows sodium ions to flow into the cell and potassium ions to flow out (i.e. it is a mixed cation-conducting channel). The Na and K permeabilities of the AMPAR channel are roughly equal, so when this channel is open the resulting change in membrane potential tends towards zero (a bit more than halfway between the equilibrium potentials E and E). This balance point is reached at around 0 mV (i.e. the reversal potential of the EPSP current is roughly 0 mV). However, the postsynaptic membrane potential will not change by more than a few millivolts from resting potential with a single presynaptic release of glutamate, because not many AMPAR channels open. The lifetime of the glutamate in the synaptic cleft is too short to allow more than a brief opening of the AMPAR channel, thus causing only a small depolarization. The open AMPAR channel is often considered to be non-calcium permeable, but this is only an approximation as AMPARs with certain subunit compositions will allow calcium through, albeit at different levels and frequency to NMDARs.\n\nHistorically, the most widely used experimental means of inducing LTP has been to deliver a tetanic stimulation to the presynaptic axon of a synapse or group of synapses. The frequency of this tetanus is typically 100 Hz, and the duration typically 1 s. A single AMPAR-mediated EPSP has a rise time-to-peak of approximately 2–5 ms and a duration of approximately 30 ms. If a synapse is being stimulated at 100 Hz, the presynaptic neuron will be attempting to release glutamate once every 10 ms. An EPSP occurring only 10 ms after a previous EPSP will arrive at a time when that previous EPSP is at its peak amplitude. Thus, during a 100 Hz stimulus train, each EPSP will add to the membrane depolarization caused by the previous EPSPs. This synaptic summation drives the membrane potential toward values that could not be reached with single synaptic stimuli. As the EPSPs summate, they will exceed the spike threshold.\n\nThe NMDA receptor (NMDAR) does not, in resting or near-resting membrane potential conditions, contribute significant current to the EPSP. Following the presynaptic release of the glutamate that binds to and opens the AMPAR, the NMDAR also binds this glutamate and opens. However, current does not flow through the NMDAR ion channel because it is instantaneously blocked by a magnesium ion (Mg) that binds to a site \"inside\" the open pore of the NMDAR channel. Magnesium has access to this binding site only when the NMDAR channel is opened by glutamate binding, a so-called open channel block.\n\nWhat makes this magnesium blockade of the NMDAR channel particularly significant in terms of LTP induction is that the block is membrane voltage-dependent. The basis of this voltage dependence is relatively straightforward. The NMDAR channel is a transmembrane protein; that is, it spans the cell membrane. As such, it also spans the electric field generated by the membrane potential. The magnesium binding site within the NMDAR channel is physically located within this electric field. Magnesium ions carrying a double positive charge can be acted upon by the field. When the cell is hyperpolarized, magnesium is stabilized inside the channel (i.e. the two positive charges on the magnesium ion are attracted toward the negative pole of the electric field, which points toward the inside of the cell). As a cell is depolarized, the field effect on the magnesium ion weakens, and the dwell time of magnesium ions within the channel decreases. Thus, the kinetics of the binding reaction between magnesium and the NMDAR channel are such that magnesium periodically unbinds and leaves the channel, only to be replaced by another magnesium ion. During the (very brief) time that the magnesium is absent from the open channel, other ions (such as sodium and calcium) can flow through the channel. However, when the cell is more hyperpolarized, the bound state of magnesium is stabilized and it leaves the channel less often and for a shorter period of time (on average). When the cell is less hyperpolarized, the magnesium leaves the channel more often and stays away for longer (on average). Hence, the magnesium blockade of the open NMDAR channel is membrane voltage-dependent.\n\nWhile the NMDAR channel itself displays little or no voltage dependence (its open channel I/V curve is more or less linear), the voltage dependence of the magnesium block effectively, if indirectly, confers voltage dependence to this channel. Thus, in effect, the NMDAR channel is both a ligand-gated and voltage-gated channel at the same time. This fact is critical to the function of the NMDAR as a Hebbian coincidence detector. More strictly speaking, inward cationic current (sodium or calcium) through the open unblocked NMDAR does decrease with depolarization (because of the decreased electrochemical \"driving force\"), but the voltage-dependent unblocking seems to outweigh this decrease in driving force, so the calcium influx into the spine caused by a pair of appropriately timed pre- and postsynaptic spikes significantly exceeds the sum of the influxes due to the individual spikes alone. This extra, or \"nonlinear\", calcium entry triggers the strength change.\n"}

It is owned by Ryman Hospitality Properties (formerly known as Gaylord Entertainment Company), and operated by Marriott International. With 2888 rooms, it is one of the 30 largest hotels in the world.\n\nThe original Opryland Hotel opened on Thanksgiving Day in 1977, on land adjacent to the Opryland USA amusement park. The hotel was originally built to support the Grand Ole Opry, a Nashville country music institution. The hotel at that time had 580 guest rooms and a ballroom. The Magnolia Lobby was designed to resemble a grand Southern mansion with an impressive staircase and a Tiffany-style chandelier.\n\nIn 1983-84 the hotel was expanded, adding over 400 guest rooms and incorporating facilities to meet the demands of the corporate meeting and convention market. A Garden Conservatory resembling a Victorian garden was added. This atrium maintained a constant temperature of 71 degrees and housed more than 10,000 plants.\n\nIn 1988, 2 acres and 797 guest rooms were added to the hotel. The Cascades Atrium was built, including a 3.5-story waterfall and more than 8,000 tropical plants. The Cascades Lobby expanded to 24 check-in stations that could check in 580 guests per hour when necessary.\n\nA 4.5-acre expansion completed in 1996 doubled the size of the resort, adding approximately 1,000 guest rooms, 10 meeting rooms, a 289,000-square-foot exhibit hall and a 57,000-square-foot ballroom. The trademark feature of this addition was the Cajun-themed Delta Atrium, which incorporated a quarter-mile-long indoor river. Flatboats were introduced to carry guests along the river, and past a water feature that included jets which were choreographed to music. When the expansion was christened, water samples from more than 1,700 rivers throughout the world (including every registered river in the United States) were poured into the Delta River. The Old Hickory Steak House, built to resemble an antebellum-style mansion, was also added. \nOn October 26, 2001, Opryland Hotel Nashville was rebranded as Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center (or Gaylord Opryland, for short), taking its name from its corporate parent. Company officials at the time stated that the \"Opryland\" branding was strong to Nashville (and Texas, initially), but did not fit with projects in other parts of the United States.\nAccording to a 2003 press release, Gaylord Opryland planned to build a 5,000-seat amphitheatre on the site in the near future, but those plans seem to have been abandoned in favor of a convention center expansion.\n\nOn May 2, 2010, a flood devastated Nashville and caused considerable damage to the Opryland Hotel. Guests were evacuated as the flood waters rose as high as 10 feet in some parts of the hotel. The hotel underwent renovations and reopened Nov. 15, 2010. Repairs and renovations to the famed hotel included the addition of five restaurants and restoration of the atriums and guest rooms.\n\nOn January 19, 2012, Gaylord Entertainment announced a new partnership with Dolly Parton's The Dollywood Company to build a new water and seasonal snow park on acreage the company owns across Briley Parkway from Gaylord Opryland. The $50 Million Phase 1 of the overall project was expected to open in Spring of 2014. On September 28, 2012, Dolly decided to withdraw her partnership in the new Nashville theme park.\n\nOn October 3, 2014, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission imposed a $600,000 fine on Marriott for willful interference with private Wi-fi hotspot connections linking its clients' portable computers to client-owned mobile telephones in the hotel's convention space.\n\nThe scheme abused a \"containment\" feature of a Wi-Fi monitoring system which was designed for the nominally lawful purpose of removing unwanted \"rogue access points\" from corporations' own local area networks. Marriott misused the system to send spurious de-authentication packets to client-owned wireless access points, which is unlawful as these are not part of Marriott's network but are owned by individual mobile subscribers. The fraudulent packets, which dissociate consumers' devices from their own Wi-Fi hotspot access points, were sent deliberately as a means to force convention-goers to buy wireless Internet access from the hotel at rates from $250–1000 per access point.\n\nAccording to FCC Enforcement Bureau Chief Travis LeBlanc, \"It is unacceptable for any hotel to intentionally disable personal hotspots while also charging consumers and small businesses high fees to use the hotel's own Wi-Fi network. This practice puts consumers in the untenable position of either paying twice for the same service or forgoing Internet access altogether.\" Despite the substantial fine, Marriott continues to deny that its conduct is illegal, saying it was using FCC approved equipment to protect its customers from hackers.\n\n\n"}

He was the 35th mayor of Los Angeles, California, from September 26, 1938, until June 30, 1953. He was the longest-serving mayor to date in the city, and was the city's second longest-serving mayor after Tom Bradley, presiding over the war boom and very heavy population growth, and building freeways to handle them.\n\nBowron was born in Poway, California, the youngest of three children. His Yankee parents, who had migrated from the Midwest, sent him to Los Angeles High School, where he graduated in 1904. In 1907, he began studies at UC Berkeley, where his two brothers had graduated, then enrolled in the University of Southern California Law School two years later where he became a member of the Delta Chi fraternity. He dropped out of law school and became a reporter for San Francisco, Oakland and Los Angeles newspapers, working the City Hall and court beats in the latter city. He was finally admitted to the bar in 1917.\n\nUpon the U.S. entry into World War I in 1917, Bowron enlisted in the Army, serving in the 14th Field Artillery before transferring to the military intelligence division. Upon his return, he once again practiced law before he married Irene Martin in 1922. The following year, he was appointed as a deputy state corporations commissioner. His work in that capacity caught the attention of California governor, Friend Richardson, who hired him as executive secretary in 1925, and then appointed him to the superior court in 1926.\n\nIn his first tenure as a superior court judge, which lasted 12 years, Bowron became the first jurist on the West Coast to use the pre-trial calendar system.\n\nHe was then elected mayor of Los Angeles on a fusion ticket in 1938 in the wake of the corruption arising from the previous administration of Frank L. Shaw, and earned the reputation of being lawful, unlike his predecessor. This was part of what he called the Los Angeles Urban Reform Revival.\n\nLos Angeles grew enormously during the war years, with very large defense industries. After the war Bowron began construction of the Los Angeles International Airport and the 1st phases of the elaborate freeway system. He obtained hundred million dollars from the Federal Housing Authority for the construction of 10,000 units. As president of the American Municipal Association, representing 9500 cities, he was the leader of the nation's mayors in their dealings with the federal government. A high priority was eliminating organized crime from the city's police department. He forced the resignation of numerous officers, and prevented Los Angeles from becoming a wide open town. Bowron ran on nonpartisan fusion tickets, but his popularity declined in his 4th term. The Los Angeles Citizens Committee demanded his recall, claiming he was responsible for high taxes and continued police corruption. In 1952 he lost his reelection bid in the Republican primary to Norris Poulson, a conservative opponent of public housing.\n\nHe served during the era of World War II, most notably supporting the removal of Japanese Americans from California and their subsequent Internment. In January 1942 Bowron began to call for relocating Japanese Americans away from the coast and putting them to work in farm camps. He forced all Japanese American employees of the City of Los Angeles to take a leave of absence and circulated propaganda targeted at people of Japanese descent. By February he was pushing for internment on his radio show, quoted on Abraham Lincoln's birthday in support of the camps: \"There isn't a shadow of a doubt but that Lincoln, the mild-mannered man whose memory we regard with almost saint-like reverence, would make short work of rounding up the Japanese and putting them where they could do no harm.\" He continued by talking about \"the people born on American soil who have secret loyalty to the Japanese Emperor.\" Bowron also attempted to pass a constitutional amendment under which American-born Japanese would be stripped of their citizen rights if they held dual U.S.-Japanese citizenship or if their parents were ineligible for U.S. citizenship. He additionally proposed allowing the government to ignore portions of the Selective Service Act and call Japanese Americans, including women and those whose age or physical status would otherwise exempt them, into non-combat military service if the war required it.\n\nHe lost re-election in 1953 after having survived a number of recall attempts, with his defeat linked partly because his liberal backing began to wane as a result of McCarthyism. In 1956, he once again ran for superior court judge, defeating Joseph L. Call in the November election. Serving one six-year term, he retired from political office in 1962, but remained active in city activities.\n\nHe played himself on the January 29, 1953 episode of \"The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show,\" titled \"The Tax Refund.\"\n\nOn January 4, 1961, his wife Irene died at the Madison Lodge Sanitarium after spending nearly five years at the facility. Ten months later, Bowron married his long-time executive assistant, Albine Norton.\n\nFollowing his retirement from the bench, he served as director of the Metropolitan Los Angeles History Project, hiring Robert C. Post, then a graduate student at UCLA, as his chief researcher. In 1967, Bowron was named chairman of the city's Citizen's Committee on Zoning Practices and Procedures.\n\nAfter finishing work on September 11, 1968 he suffered a fatal heart attack while driving home. While his body lay in state in the Los Angeles City Hall rotunda, people came to pay their respects.

This \"transitional\" DPT takes into account a physical therapist's current level of knowledge and skill and purports to offer programs that upgrade clinical skills to meet the needs of the current health care environment. Creighton University followed by initiating the first entry-level DPT program in 1993.\n\nThe Doctor of Physiotherapy has since been adopted in other countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia, and Taiwan. In the United Kingdom and Australia, the PhD or Professional Doctorate in Physiotherapy is offered by a number of Universities. These programs are usually professional entry masters level programs, with the opportunity to undertake research to lead to a doctorate degree. Alternatively, these programs are masters pre-qualifying Physiotherapy courses with an enhanced research element in the final phase of the course that leads to undertaking a doctorate. The first full pre-qualifying Doctorate in Physiotherapy program in the United Kingdom was accredited in 2017 at Glasgow Caledonian University in Glasgow.\n\nThe DPT degree currently prepares students to be eligible for the physical therapy license examination in all 50 US states. Along with the license examination, some states do require physical therapists to take a law exam and a criminal background check. As of March 2017, there are 222 accredited Doctor of Physical Therapy programs in the United States. After completing a DPT program the doctor of physical therapy may continue training in a residency and then fellowship. As of December 2013, there are 178 credentialed physical therapy residencies and 34 fellowships in the US, and 63 additional developing residencies and fellowships. Credentialed residencies are between 9 and 36 months while credentialed fellowships are between 6 and 36 months.\n\nIn 2000 the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) passed its \"Vision 2020\" statement, which states (in part):\n\nAs this statement highlights, the DPT program is an integral part of the APTA's continued advocacy for legislation granting consumers (\"i.e.\" patients and clients) direct access to physical therapists, rather than requiring physician referral. Direct access is said to decrease wait times for access to care and even help reduce both cost to consumer and overall healthcare costs. As of January 1, 2015, all 50 states and the District of Columbia currently allow some form of direct access to physical therapists.\n\nThe typical time frame for completion of a Doctor of Physical Therapy is 3 to 4 years after earning a bachelor's degree. Depending on residency and fellowship training, if undertaken, the doctor may have completed several years of additional training. Obtaining a DPT could also be done by accelerated programs offered by some universities that can be applied to by freshman. These programs give students the opportunity receive a bachelor's degree and DPT in 6- to 7- years. With these programs, there are various admission points over the course of their curriculum. Various programs allow students to apply directly out of high school and they will automatically matriculate into the professional phase of the program after completing the required undergraduate courses.\n\nAdmission to a Doctor of Physical Therapy program in the USA is highly competitive. According to the Aggregate Program Data Report from CAPTE from 2016–2017, the average GPA for enrolling students was 3.6 with a range of 3.20 - 3.88 for all programs. On average there were 1,000 applicants per program with an average of 46 students enrolled. A bachelor's degree generally is required before beginning a Doctor of Physical Therapy program, but there is no requirement on the degree earned as long as all prerequisite course requirements are met. Obtaining a DPT could also be done by accelerated programs by some universities that can be applied by freshman. Through these programs students can receive a bachelor's degree and a DPT in 6 to 7 years. During the admission process into schools, one must fulfill the course prerequisites of the program. Students also must obtain physical therapy experience from clinics with hours that might have to be verified by a physical therapist depending on the school they are applying to. The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) must be taken and submitted to the school.\n\nThe t-DPT degree is conferred upon completion of a structured post-professional educational experience that results in the augmentation of knowledge, skills, and behaviors to a level consistent with the current professional (entry-level) DPT standards. The t-DPT degree enables the US-licensed physical therapist to attain degree parity with therapists who hold the professional DPT by filling in any gaps between their professional baccalaureate or master's degree PT education and the current professional DPT degree education.\n\nThe post-professional DPT (Transitional) degree is designed to provide the doctoral credential to those who currently holding a master's or bachelor's degree in the field. Post-professional DPT (Transitional) degree programs are typically offered on a primarily online learning model and are often one year in length.\n\nThe use of the title \"doctor\" by physical therapists and other non-physician health care professionals has been debated. In a letter to \"The New York Times\", the president of the American Physical Therapy Association responded:\n\nIn 2007, the DPT degree has been described as an example of \"credential creep\" or degree inflation in \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\". Citing concerns that the DPT, and similar professional doctorates in areas such as occupational therapy, do not meet the standards of traditional doctorate degrees, the journal states: \"The six-and-a-half-year doctor of physical therapy, or DPT, is rapidly replacing a six-year master's degree ... The American Physical Therapy Association ... has not set separate requirements for doctoral programs. To be accredited they need only to meet the same requirements as master's programs.\"\nCritics in the 1990s questioned whether the rigor of the physical therapy curriculum and the scope of practice warranted the conferral of a professional degree similar to that characteristic of medicine, dentistry, or nursing. Proponents countered that the existing curricula are \"victims of 'curricular inflation'.\" Rothstein and Moffat noted, the previous master's and even baccalaureate curricula rivaled those of most other professional doctorate programs, and these curricula often required more than the typical 72 credits mandated for a doctoral degree. The 2000 Fact Sheet from APTA reported that the mean number of credits required for the professional phase of the typical baccalaureate program was 83.0 credits and that the typical master's degree program required 95.5 credits. As of 2009 the typical number of prerequisite credits was 114.2 and the total number of professional credits was 116.5 for a total of 230.7 credit hours. Additional credit hours may also be earned in residency and fellowship. Threlkeld et al. suggested that the scope of existing physical therapy curricula already (in 1999) matched that of a professional doctorate, further submitting that students of a well-defined DPT program \"will have earned the right to be recognized by the doctoral title\".\n\nThe professional (entry-level) DPT degree is currently the degree conferred by all physical therapist professional programs upon successful completion of a three- to four-year post-baccalaureate degree program in the United States, preparing the graduate to enter the practice of physical therapy. Admission requirements for the program include completion of an undergraduate degree that includes specific prerequisite coursework, volunteer experience (or other exposure to the profession), and completion of a standardized graduate examination (e.g., GRE).\n\nTypical prerequisite courses may include two semesters of anatomy and physiology with labs, two semesters of physics with labs, two semesters of chemistry with labs, a general course in psychology, another course in psychology, statistics, two semesters of biology, and may include other courses required by specific schools.\n\nThe physical therapist curriculum consists of foundational sciences (i.e., gross anatomy, cellular histology, embryology, neurology, neuroscience, kinesiology, physiology, exercise physiology, pathology, pharmacology, radiology/imaging, medical screening), behavioral sciences (communication, social and psychologic factors, ethics and values, law, business and management sciences, clinical reasoning and evidence-based practice), and clinical sciences (cardiovascular/pulmonary, endocrine and metabolic, gastrointestinal and genitourinary, integumentary, musculoskeletal, neuromuscular). Coursework also includes material specific to the practice of physical therapy (patient/client management model, prevention, wellness, and health promotion, practice management, management of care delivery, social responsibility, advocacy, and core values). Additionally, students have to engage in full-time clinical practice under the supervision of licensed physical therapists with an expectation of providing safe, competent, and effective physical therapy.\n\nPost-graduation, licensed physical therapists have the ability to pursue a clinical residency or fellowship to expand their knowledge and experience. Clinical residencies are designed to further a physical therapy resident's knowledge in a specific area of clinical practice. A clinical fellowship is a program for physical therapists in an area of the specific focus.\n\nPhysical therapists also have the ability to pursue specialty certifications, where they become board certified clinical specialists. Becoming a certified specialist allows the therapist to earn credentials that represents further dedication to patient care. It gives the opportunity for professional growth and positions in leadership and service. This specialization is done by building a broad foundation of professional education then building a skill set related to the particular specialization area. The certifications given in the specific areas are: cardiovascular and pulmonary, clinical electrophysiology, geriatrics, neurology, orthopedics, pediatrics, sports physical therapy, and women's health.\n\nPhysical therapists can provide various modalities of treatment for the patient. The modalities include: ultrasound, electrical stimulation, traction, joint mobilization, massage, heat, ice, kinesiology taping, and many more. Forms of treatment depends on the therapist's preference of treatment and the clinics equipment availability. Based on the patient, specific types of treatment might be better suited. Therapists might also find different modalities not as effective as others. However, some modalities might not be possible due to the clinics restrictions on space and equipment availability.\n\nThe \"advanced clinical science\" doctorate (e.g., DPTSc or DScPT, DHSc, ScDPT) is one of several degrees conferred by academic institutions upon successful completion of a post-professional physical therapist education program. This program is intended to provide an experienced clinician with advanced knowledge, clinical skills, and professional behavior, usually in a specific specialty practice area. These programs typically culminate work that contributes new knowledge to clinical practice in the profession. Completion of these advanced clinical science doctoral programs may include credentialed clinical residencies and lead to ABPTS clinical specialization or other advanced certifications.\n\nSome universities, such as Glasgow Caledonian University and Robert Gordon University, offer a 3.5 year DPT program, including both professional training and research, which leads to qualification as a physiotherapist eligible to register with the Health and Care Professions Council. In general, the qualifying degree for physiotherapy in the UK is a Bachelor or Master of Science in Physiotherapy.\nIn 2013 the United Kingdom gave physiotherapists the power to prescribe medication.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2110712", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2110712", "title": "ICO (file format)", "text": "ICO (file format)\n\nThe ICO file format is an image file format for computer icons in Microsoft Windows. ICO files contain one or more small images at multiple sizes and color depths, such that they may be scaled appropriately. In Windows, all executables that display an icon to the user, on the desktop, in the Start Menu, or in Windows Explorer, must carry the icon in ICO format.\n\nThe CUR file format is an almost identical image file format for non-animated cursors in Microsoft Windows. The only differences between these two file formats are the bytes used to identify them and the addition of a hotspot in the CUR format header; the hotspot is defined as the pixel offset (in x,y coordinates) from the top-left corner of the cursor image where the user is actually pointing the mouse.\n\nIcons introduced in Windows 1.0 were 32×32 pixels in size and were monochrome. Support for 16 colors was introduced in Windows 3.0.\n\nWin32 introduced support for storing icon images of up to 16.7 million colors (TrueColor) and up to 256x256 pixels in dimensions. Windows 95 also introduced a new Device Independent Bitmap (DIB) engine. However, 256 color was the default icon color depth in Windows 95. It was possible to enable 65535 color (Highcolor) icons by either modifying the \"Shell Icon BPP\" value in the registry or by purchasing Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95. The \"Shell Icon Size\" value allows using larger icons in place of 32×32 icons and the \"Shell Small Icon Size\" value allows using custom sizes in place of 16×16 icons. Thus, a single icon file could store images of any size from 1×1 pixel up to 256×256 pixels (including non-square sizes) with 2 (rarely used),16, 256, 65535, or 16.7 million colors; but the shell could not display very large sized icons. The notification area of the Windows taskbar was limited to 16 color icons by default until Windows Me when it was updated to support high color icons.\n\nWindows XP added support for 32-bit color (16.7 million colors plus alpha channel transparency) icon images, thus allowing semitransparent areas like shadows, anti-aliasing, and glass-like effects to be drawn in an icon. Windows XP, by default, employs 48×48 pixel icons in Windows Explorer. Windows XP can be forced to use icons as large as 256×256 by modifying the \"Shell icon size\" value but this would cause all 32×32 icons throughout the shell to be upscaled. Microsoft only recommended icon sizes up to 48×48 pixels for Windows XP. Windows XP can downscale 256×256 and larger icons if no closer image size is available.\n\nWindows Vista added a 256×256-pixel icon view to Windows Explorer, as well as support for the compressed PNG format. Although compression is not required, Microsoft recommends that all 256×256 icons in ICO files should be stored in PNG format to reduce the overall size of the file. The Windows Vista Explorer supports smoothly scaling icons to non-standard sizes which are rendered on the fly even if an image is not present for that size in the icon file. The Windows Vista shell adds a slider for \"zooming\" the icon sizes in and out. With users using higher resolutions and high DPI modes, larger icon formats (such as 256×256) are recommended.\n\nWhile the IANA-registered MIME type for ICO files is codice_1, it was submitted to IANA in 2003 by a third party and is not recognised by Microsoft software, which uses codice_2 instead. Erroneous types codice_3, codice_4, codice_5 and codice_6 have also been seen in use.\n\nAn ICO or CUR file is made up of an ICONDIR (\"Icon directory\") structure, containing an ICONDIRENTRY structure for each image in the file, followed by a contiguous block of all image bitmap data (which may be in either Windows BMP format, excluding the BITMAPFILEHEADER structure, or in PNG format, stored in its entirety).\n\nImages with less than 32 bits of color depth follow a particular format: the image is encoded as a single image consisting of a color mask (the \"XOR mask\") together with an opacity mask (the \"AND mask\"). The XOR mask must precede the AND mask inside the bitmap data; if the image is stored in bottom-up order (which it most likely is), the XOR mask would be drawn below the AND mask. The AND mask is 1 bit per pixel, regardless of the color depth specified by the BMP header, and specifies which pixels are fully transparent and which are fully opaque. The XOR mask conforms to the bit depth specified in the BMP header and specifies the numerical color or palette value for each pixel. Together, the AND mask and XOR mask make for a non-transparent image representing an image with 1-bit transparency; they also allow for inversion of the background. The height for the image in the ICONDIRENTRY structure of the ICO/CUR file takes on that of the intended image dimensions (after the masks are composited), whereas the height in the BMP header takes on that of the two mask images combined (before they are composited). Therefore, the masks must each be of the same dimensions, and the height specified in the BMP header must be exactly twice the height specified in the ICONDIRENTRY structure.\n\n32-bit images (including 32-bit BITMAPINFOHEADER-format BMP images) are specifically a 24-bit image with the addition of an 8-bit channel for alpha compositing. Thus, in 32-bit images, the AND mask is not required, but recommended for consideration. Windows XP and higher will use a 32-bit image in less than True color mode by constructing an AND mask based on the alpha channel (if one does not reside with the image already) if no 24-bit version of the image is supplied in the ICO/CUR file. However, earlier versions of Windows interpret all pixels with 100% opacity unless an AND mask is supplied with the image. Supplying a custom AND mask will also allow for tweaking and hinting by the icon author. Even if the AND mask is not supplied, if the image is in Windows BMP format, the BMP header must still specify a doubled height.\n\nAll values in ICO/CUR files are represented in little-endian byte order.\n\nHeader\n\nStructure of image directory\n\nReferenced image data\n\nAll image data referenced by entries in the image directory proceed directly after the image directory. It is customary practice to store them in the same order as defined in the image directory.\n\nRecall that if an image is stored in BMP format, it must exclude the opening BITMAPFILEHEADER structure, whereas if it is stored in PNG format, it must be stored in its entirety.\n\nThe ability to read PNG images from ICO and CUR format images was introduced in Windows Vista. A PNG image can be stored in the image in the same way as done for a standard Windows BMP format image, with the exception that the PNG image must be stored in its entirety, with its file header.\n\nAn icon library is a way to package Windows icons. It is typically a 16-bit New Executable or a 32-bit Portable Executable binary file having .ICL extension with icon resources being the packaged icons. Windows Vista and later versions do not support viewing icons from 16-bit (New Executable) files.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2110720", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2110720", "title": "Pencil fish", "text": "Pencil fish\n\nNannostomus, (from the Greek: \"nanos\" = small, and the Latin \"stomus\" = relating to the mouth), is a genus of fish belonging to the characin family Lebiasinidae. All of the species in this genus are known as pencil fish or pencilfish, a popular name that was first only applied to two species in the 1920s, \"Nannostomus unifasciatus\" and \"Nannostomus eques\", but by the late 1950s would come to be applied to all members of the genus. Several of the species have become popular aquarium fish due to their attractive coloration, unique shape, and interesting demeanor.\n\nThe genus \"Nannostomus\" was first erected by Günther in 1872 with the type species, \"Nannostomus beckfordi\". In 1876, Steindachner described three more species, \"Nannostomus unifasciatus\", \"Nannostomus eques\" (pictured below) and \"Nannostomus trifasciatus\" (pictured above). In 1909, Carl H. Eigenmann described \"Nannostomus marginatus\", \"Nannostomus minimus\" and \"Nannostomus harrisoni\". All but \"N. minimus\" have been popular with aquarists since the early 20th century, in part due to enthusiastic articles written about them, and photographs taken of them, by William T. Innes that were published as early as 1933. Over the years, the genus was split by subsequent authors into other genera, including \"Poecilobrycon\" and \"Nannobrycon\". After nearly a century of debate on the subject, Dr. Stanley H. Weitzman and Dr. J. Stanley Cobb restored earlier taxonomy and expanded upon it, unifying all species under \"Nannostomus\" in 1975. This comprehensive revision of the genus has now been widely accepted. Dr. Weitzman is also responsible for the description of five of the more recently introduced species, \"Nannostomus marilynae\", \"Nannostomus limatus\", \"Nannostomus nitidus,\" \"Nannostomus britskii\", and \"Nannostomus anduzei\". Nineteen species are now known, most of which are also familiar to aquarists. Several other unidentified \"Nannostomus\" species have been imported over the years, many found as bycatch with other small characins, but their taxonomic status is yet to be determined.\n\nThe 19 currently recognized species in this genus are:\n\nMost species are slender, pencil-shaped fish ranging in size from under 1 to about 2 in long. \"N. marginatus\", \"N. rubrocaudatus\", and \"N. mortenthaleri\" possess shortened, blockier outlines reminiscent of pencil stubs. All but one species, \"Nannostomus espei\", possess one to five horizontal black or brown stripes with gold or silver iridescence appearing dorsal to the primary stripe. Most also display red, orange, or maroon highlights in their fins, and many have flashes of these colors on their flanks, as well. The recently described \"N. mortenthaleri\" and \"N. rubrocaudatus\" are especially vividly colored. For \"N. espei\" alone, horizontal stripes are only weakly present and are supplanted by five dark comma-shaped blotches. This pattern is assumed by other species at night, but only \"N. espei\" displays the pattern permanently and in daylight. The adipose fin is present in some species and absent in others, while in certain species, \"N. eques\" for example, it may be present or absent within the species. All swim in a horizontal attitude except \"N. unifasciatus\" and \"N. eques\", which assume an oblique, 'snout-up' posture. A range of sexual dimorphism occurs in the genus, with males being more brilliantly colored in some species, especially with regard to color present in the fins, and far less evident in other species. However, a reliable indicator of gender for most of the species rests in the anal fin of adult males which is enlarged and elongated (as in \"N. espei\", \"N. eques\", etc.) and/or the anal fin of males is more colorful (as in \"N. harrisoni\", \"N. marginatus\" etc.). The popular aquarium species, \"N. trifasciatus\", is an exception in this regard.\n\nThe genus has a vast distribution in South America, from Colombia, Venezuela, and the Guyanas in the north, to the southern Amazon basin and Bolivia in the south, to Peru in the west and Belém, Brazil, in the east. Several of the individual species have a distribution nearly as vast. As a result, many of the species are polymorphic and manifest marked color variations depending on the population. Over the years, some of these color variants have been erroneously described as separate species. Such names as 'Nannostomus ocellatus', 'N. anomalus' and 'N. auratus', among many others, are now known to be junior synonyms to the various species. To date, only two species, \"N. beckfordi\" and \"N. harrisoni\", have been commercially raised for the aquarium trade in fisheries, mostly in Asia. All of the remaining species that find their way to home aquaria are wild-caught from South American waters.\n\n\"Nannostomus\" species thrive in home aquaria when provided with soft, moderately acidic water, low nitrate levels, and temperatures in the range of 22 to 28 °C. The addition of aquatic plants, including floating varieties, is recommended. The latter reduce the likelihood of the fish jumping, which is a common occurrence for some of the species, especially \"N. espei\" and \"N. unifasciatus\". They should be kept in schools of at least six. If kept in a community aquarium, the best tankmates are other species of \"Nannostomus,\" small peaceful characins, and corydoras. Aquaria with strong water current, large tankmates, or swift-moving species are contraindicated. If kept in a thickly planted single-species aquarium with the above water parameters, most species will spawn, eggs will not be eaten, and the fry will be found among the floating plants. Baby brine shrimp, live or frozen, and other small-sized foods are required for both fry and adults. They are also avid biofilm grazers and, for most of the species, algae are under-reported staples of their diet. In most species, the males establish small territories and defend them. Their defensive actions are usually harmless, but in two species, \"N. mortenthaleri\" and \"N. trifasciatus\", antagonistic behavior directed at conspecifics can have deleterious results if sufficient space and plant cover are not provided. Once acclimated to the aquarium and provided with suitable conditions, they are hardy, often living for five or more years.\n\n"}

It is a two-dimensional case of the general \"n\"-dimensional phase space.\n\nThe phase plane method refers to graphically determining the existence of limit cycles in the solutions of the differential equation.\n\nThe solutions to the differential equation are a family of functions. Graphically, this can be plotted in the phase plane like a two-dimensional vector field. Vectors representing the derivatives of the points with respect to a parameter (say time \"t\"), that is (\"dx\"/\"dt\", \"dy\"/\"dt\"), at representative points are drawn. With enough of these arrows in place the system behaviour over the regions of plane in analysis can be visualized and limit cycles can be easily identified.\n\nThe entire field is the \"phase portrait\", a particular path taken along a flow line (i.e. a path always tangent to the vectors) is a \"phase path\". The flows in the vector field indicate the time-evolution of the system the differential equation describes.\n\nIn this way, phase planes are useful in visualizing the behaviour of physical systems; in particular, of oscillatory systems such as predator-prey models (see Lotka–Volterra equations). In these models the phase paths can \"spiral in\" towards zero, \"spiral out\" towards infinity, or reach neutrally stable situations called centres where the path traced out can be either circular, elliptical, or ovoid, or some variant thereof. This is useful in determining if the dynamics are stable or not.\n\nOther examples of oscillatory systems are certain chemical reactions with multiple steps, some of which involve dynamic equilibria rather than reactions that go to completion. In such cases one can model the rise and fall of reactant and product concentration (or mass, or amount of substance) with the correct differential equations and a good understanding of chemical kinetics.\n\nA two-dimensional system of linear differential equations can be written in the form:\n\nwhich can be organized into a matrix equation:\n\nwhere A is the 2 × 2 coefficient matrix above, and x = (\"x\", \"y\") is a coordinate vector of two independent variables.\n\nSuch systems may be solved analytically, for this case by integrating:\n\nformula_3\n\nalthough the solutions are implicit functions in \"x\" and \"y\", and are difficult to interpret.\n\nMore commonly they are solved with the coefficients of the right hand side written in matrix form using eigenvalues λ, given by the determinant:\n\nand eigenvectors:\n\nThe eigenvalues represent the powers of the exponential components and the eigenvectors are coefficients. If the solutions are written in algebraic form, they express the fundamental multiplicative factor of the exponential term. Due to the nonuniqueness of eigenvectors, every solution arrived at in this way has undetermined constants \"c\", \"c\", ... \"c\".\n\nThe general solution is:\n\nwhere λ and λ are the eigenvalues, and (k, k), (k, k) are the basic eigenvectors. The constants \"c\" and \"c\" account for the nonuniqueness of eigenvectors and are not solvable unless an initial condition is given for the system.\n\nThe above determinant leads to the characteristic polynomial:\n\nwhich is just a quadratic equation of the form:\n\nwhere;\n\n(\"tr\" denotes trace) and\n\nThe explicit solution of the eigenvalues are then given by the quadratic formula:\n\nwhere\n\nThe eigenvectors and nodes determine the profile of the phase paths, providing a pictorial interpretation of the solution to the dynamical system, as shown next.\n\nThe phase plane is then first set-up by drawing straight lines representing the two eigenvectors (which represent stable situations where the system either converges towards those lines or diverges away from them). Then the phase plane is plotted by using full lines instead of direction field dashes. The signs of the eigenvalues indicate the phase plane's behaviour:\n\n\nThe above can be visualized by recalling the behaviour of exponential terms in differential equation solutions.\n\nThis example covers only the case for real, separate eigenvalues. Real, repeated eigenvalues require solving the coefficient matrix with an unknown vector and the first eigenvector to generate the second solution of a two-by-two system. However, if the matrix is symmetric, it is possible to use the orthogonal eigenvector to generate the second solution.\n\nComplex eigenvalues and eigenvectors generate solutions in the form of sines and cosines as well as exponentials. One of the simplicities in this situation is that only one of the eigenvalues and one of the eigenvectors is needed to generate the full solution set for the system.\n\n\n"}

The album received mixed reviews from contemporary music critics. \"Ben\" was more successful on the music charts than Jackson's previous studio album, having charted within the top 10 on the \"Billboard\" 200. Internationally, the album was less successful, peaking at number 12 in Canada, while charting within the top 200 positions in Australia and France.\n\nWorldwide, \"Ben\" has sold a reported 5 million units. The album released one single, the title track \"Ben\", which was a commercial success on the music charts, topping both the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and the Australian \"ARIA\" charts, giving Jackson his first number 1 single, domestically and internationally. \"Ben\" also charted within the top 10 in other territories worldwide. \"Everybody's Somebody's Fool\" was planned to be released as the second single from the album, but was cancelled for unspecified reasons. Two of the album's songs were \"stripped\" in 2009 as part of the three-disc compilation \"\".\n\nIn January 1972, while still a member of the band, Jackson released his first studio album, entitled \"Got to Be There\", under Motown Records. The album received generally mixed reviews from contemporary music critics. The album was not commercially successful worldwide, as well as not having a good chart performance on music charts. The album's three singles had a good chart performance on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, with all charting within the top 20 positions on the chart, two peaking within the top 5. \"Got to Be There\" was more successful in the U.S. than internationally, peaking at number 14 on the \"Billboard\" 200 while peaking at number 37 in the U.K. and number 121 in France.\n\nRecording sessions for \"Ben\" began in November 1971, concluding by February 1972 before Jackson's voice began to deepen. It was produced by six people, and executive-produced by Berry Gordy. Songwriters for the 10 tracks of \"Ben\" include Mel Larson, Jerry Marcellino, Thom Bell, Linda Creed, The Corporation, Smokey Robinson, and Ronald White, among others. The album's songs have a tempo ranging from 69 beats per minute on \"Ben\", to 130 on \"Shoo-Be-Doo-Be-Doo-Da-Day\".\n\nThe album's title track, the theme song for the 1972 film of the same name (the sequel to the 1971 killer rat movie \"Willard\"), won a Golden Globe and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Song. \"What Goes Around Comes Around\" has similarities to Jackson's older brother Jackie's single, \"Didn't I (Blow Your Mind This Time)\", which featured vocals from Jackson and his older brothers. For \"Ben\", Jackson recorded a cover of The Temptations' 1964 single, \"My Girl\", a cover of The Stylistics' 1971 hit \"People Make The World Go Round\", a cover of Lionel Hampton's \"Everybody's Somebody's Fool\", a cover of Brenda Holloway's 1965 single, \"You Can Cry on My Shoulder\" and a cover of Stevie Wonder's 1968 single, \"Shoo-Be-Doo-Be-Doo-Da-Day\". \"My Girl\" has a funk rhythm and the song's score includes some call-and-response interaction, which is similar to what Jackson and his brothers displayed in their Jackson 5 material. \"You Can Cry on My Shoulder\" is a mid-tempo song. \"We've Got a Good Thing Going\" was previously issued as the B-side to \"Got to Be There\"s \"I Wanna Be Where You Are\" and \"In Our Small Way\" was also featured on Jackson's previous album \"Got to Be There\".\n\nThe album was released by Motown Records, his second studio album for the label as a solo artist, in August 1972. As part of promotion for the album, \"Ben\" was released as the album's lead and only single in July 1972. \"Ben\" was a commercial success worldwide, generally charting within the top 10 and top 20 positions on the music charts. The song peaked at number 1 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, which was Jackson's first, of what would be 13 songs, to top that chart during his career as a solo artist. \"Ben\" also charted on \"Billboard\"s Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs at number 3 and 5. \"Ben\" charted within the top 10 on the Dutch Top 40 chart, peaking at number 2 and number 7 on the U.K. Singles Chart, as well as charting at number 14 in Australia. \"Everybody's Somebody's Fool\" was planned to be released as the second single from the album, but was cancelled for unspecified reasons.\n\n\"Ben\" was more successful on music charts in both the U.S. and worldwide compared to Jackson's previous studio album. The album peaked at number 5 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" 200; becoming Jackson's first of what would be six studio albums to peak within the top 10 on that chart. \"Ben\" also peaked at number 4 on the U.S. Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. On January 13, 1973, \"Ben\" debuted on the U.K. Album Chart at its peak position, number 17. The album remained within the country's music chart's top 50 positions for seven consecutive weeks. On January 1, 1973, the album was certified Silver by the British Phonographic Industry for shipping 60,000 units across the U.K. After Jackson's death in June 2009, his music experienced a surge in popularity. The album charted on the French music charts on July 25, 2009, at its peak position of number 162. \"Ben\" remained within the country's top 200 positions for two consecutive weeks. The album has reportedly sold over 5 million units worldwide.\n\nThe album generally received mixed to positive reviews from contemporary music critics. Lindsay Planer of Allmusic gave \"Ben\" a four out of five star rating. Planer cited \"What Goes Around Comes Around' as being \"one of \"Ben\"s better deep cuts\" and \"Shoo Be Doo Be Doo Da Day\" as being a \"winner\" while describing \"In Our Small Way\" as being a \"lesser note\" for the album, having felt that the song contained a \"hopelessly dated 'message'\". Planer noted that one \"interesting shift was the lack of participation from the Motown hitmaking machine known collectively as 'The Corporation'\". Vince Aletti of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine gave the album a two out of five star rating. Aletti noted that while the album \"contains a good deal more original material\" it \"has nothing as luscious as 'Got to Be There' or 'I Wanna Be Where You Are,'\" but, \"it's on the whole a much stronger album than the first.\" He noted that in the album's title track, Jackson had a \"surprising amount of feeling\" in his vocal performance. Leah Greenblatt, of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the album a \"B\" grade. Greenblatt commented that \"Ben\"s title track was a \"testament to his talent\" and added that the album would \"always be defined\" by that one song.\n\nAdapted from AllMusic.\n\n\n"}

He later emigrated to South Africa and settled on the Natal coast.\n\nGoulding first gained prominence as a local athlete in the Gloucestershire area when he won a number of races in the 1895 season. In a meeting at Gloucester he defeated the visiting South African champion but was less successful at the AAA championships where he finished last in his heat.\n\nGoulding competed in the 110 metre hurdles in Athens. He finished in first place in his preliminary heat with a time of 18.4 seconds, advancing to the final. In the final he faced only Thomas Curtis of the United States after two other finalists had withdrawn. A stumble from Goulding at the start of the race appears to have been decisive; although he gained ground on Curtis after halfway, he could not close the gap. At the end of the race, the officials declared that Curtis had won by a margin of a mere 5 centimetres. Both finished in 17.6 seconds. In 1932, Curtis wrote in \"The Sportsman\" that Goulding \"stopped neither to linger or say farewell, but went straight from the stadium to the station and took the first train out of Athens\".\n\nIn the 1984 NBC miniseries, \"\", he was portrayed as being very pompous and having a habit of taking his opponents (especially the Americans) very lightly.

{"id": "2110765", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2110765", "title": "P.M. Dawn", "text": "P.M. Dawn\n\nP.M. Dawn was an American hip hop and R&B act formed in 1988 by the brothers Attrell Cordes (known by his stage name Prince Be, sometimes credited as Prince Be the Nocturnal) and Jarrett Cordes (known as DJ Minutemix) in Jersey City, New Jersey. They earned significant crossover success in the early 1990s with music that merged hip hop, older soul, and more pop-oriented urban R&B.\n\nAfter recording their debut single \"Ode to a Forgetful Mind\" in 1988, P.M. Dawn released their first album \"\" in 1991 to critical acclaim. It achieved immediate commercial success because of its single \"Set Adrift on Memory Bliss\". Their 1993 follow-up \"The Bliss Album…? (Vibrations of Love and Anger and the Ponderance of Life and Existence)\" was also praised by critics and featured the hit singles \"I'd Die Without You\" and \"Looking Through Patient Eyes\". P.M. Dawn continued to receive strong reviews with their subsequent albums \"Jesus Wept\" (1995) and \"Dearest Christian, I'm So Very Sorry for Bringing You Here. Love, Dad\" (1998), which sold poorly.\n\nThe Cordes brothers' father died of pneumonia when they were children. Further family tragedy occurred when their baby brother, Duncan, drowned at the age of two. The two elder brothers were raised by their mother and their stepfather George Brown, a founding member of Kool & the Gang.\n\nAttrell Cordes began DJing parties and composing songs in ninth grade. Cordes, known by his stage name Prince Be, and his younger brother, Jarrett Cordes, known as DJ Minutemix, formed P.M. Dawn in 1988. The group's first demo tape was created using $600 that Prince Be had earned through his job as a night security guard at a homeless shelter.\n\nThey first approached Tommy Boy Records, the rap music subsidiary of Warner Brothers, with their demo, but they were told that they were too much like alternative hip-hoppers De La Soul, and not hardcore or ghetto, and were turned away. Eventually, Warlock, an independent record label, issued a debut single, \"Ode to a Forgetful Mind\", in 1989, but it went unnoticed.\n\nThe record label that released the single in the United Kingdom, Gee Street Records, found greater success. Gee Street mixed and marketed the song so that it earned considerable attention from music reviewers, and P.M. Dawn found themselves courted not just by Gee Street's head, Jon Baker, but also by most of the major UK record labels. Gee Street brought the brothers to London in 1990 to record tracks for an album; however, the label found itself facing bankruptcy during the recording. The entire Gee Street operation, along with P.M. Dawn's recording contract, was sold to the highest bidder, Island Records. Island issued a few more singles in the United Kingdom before releasing their debut album, \"\".\n\n\"Of the Heart, of the Soul and of the Cross\" featured the international hit \"Set Adrift on Memory Bliss\", which sampled the Spandau Ballet song \"True\", and featured a cameo by Spandau Ballet singer Tony Hadley in the music video of the song. \"Set Adrift on Memory Bliss\" hit No. 1 the week of November 30, 1991, and is the first No. 1 song on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart following the introduction of Nielsen SoundScan to the chart. The song also reached No. 3 in the United Kingdom. \"Paper Doll\", which was one of the early singles Island released in the United Kingdom, was released in the US as a follow-up to \"Set Adrift on Memory Bliss\", and peaked at No. 28 in early 1992. \"Paper Doll\" is said well over 100 times in the song, which makes it second only to MC Hammer's \"Pray\", which holds the record for the most times a title is repeated in a US Top 40 hit (147 times).\n\nWith the success of their debut album, the band parted company with their manager Nick Hemmings and embarked on a world tour. During this world tour, Prince Be gave an interview to \"Details\" magazine in which he expressed skepticism of rapper KRS-One's activism: \"KRS-One wants to be a teacher, but a teacher of what?\" KRS-One and his crew, Boogie Down Productions, responded by storming a P.M. Dawn concert, forcing the group off the stage and performing their songs \"I'm Still #1\" and \"The Bridge Is Over\". Defending his actions to \"USA Today\"s James T. Jones IV, KRS-One remarked, \"I answered his question. 'A teacher of what?' I'm a teacher of respect.\"\n\nIn 1992, P.M. Dawn appeared on the Red Hot Organization's compilation CD \"Red Hot + Dance\", contributing the Richie Rich Mix of \"Set Adrift on Memory Bliss\". The album, featuring George Michael and Madonna among others, was meant to raise money and awareness in support of the AIDS epidemic.\n\nBefore releasing their follow-up album, \"The Bliss Album…? (Vibrations of Love and Anger and the Ponderance of Life and Existence)\", P.M. Dawn contributed the single \"I'd Die Without You\" to the 1992 Eddie Murphy comedy \"Boomerang\" and its soundtrack. This #3 pop hit was also included on \"The Bliss Album…?\", as was the \"Billboard\" #6 pop hit \"Looking Through Patient Eyes\".\n\n\"Looking Through Patient Eyes\" featured backing vocals by Cathy Dennis and sampled George Michael's hit \"Father Figure\". The music video for the song was shot in a church, and featured Christian images throughout — most notably, Prince Be wore a T-shirt with \"Thank you, Jesus\" written across it in black lettering.\n\n\"The Bliss Album…?\" featured the Boy George duet \"More Than Likely\" and a cover of The Beatles' \"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\". The album also included \"So On and So On,\" which led to a 1999 sampling lawsuit. In the lawsuit \"Batiste v. Island Records, Inc.\", Paul and Michael Batiste claimed that P.M. Dawn's song \"So On and So On\" used unauthorized samples from David Batiste & The Gladiators' \"Funky Soul\". The fifth Circuit Federal Appellate Court found that the Batistes point to no evidence in the record demonstrating that consumers were confused or deceived by either the use of a digital sample of \"Funky Soul\" in \"So On and So On\", or the attribution to David Batiste as a co-author of the track. The Batistes' claim that Paul and Michael Batiste were improperly excluded from the liner notes accompanying the album also failed to suggest that consumers were confused, especially because the liner notes do credit the name of the band in which both Paul and Michael Batiste performed. Though Island Records won the lawsuit, the song was removed from subsequent releases of \"The Bliss Album\" and is no longer available for purchase in their publishing catalog.\n\n P.M. Dawn contributed a cover of \"You Got Me Floatin'\" to the 1993 compilation album \"\". Artists ranging from Pat Metheny to Eric Clapton to Ice-T's Body Count were included. They also remixed Beautiful People's \"If 60's Was 90's\".\n\nTheir 1995 album \"Jesus Wept\" was unable to attain the success of their first two albums. The album's highest charting single was \"Downtown Venus\", which contained a sample of Deep Purple's \"Hush\", and reached #48 on the \"Billboard\" chart. Also, in 1995, P.M. Dawn was credited with the remix of White Zombie's \"Blood, Milk and Sky\" (Miss September Mix) on the \"Supersexy Swingin' Sounds\" compilation album. In 1996, P.M. Dawn contributed \"Non-Fiction Burning\" to the AIDS benefit album \"Red Hot + Rio\" produced by the Red Hot Organization. In 1998, Prince Be contributed the tracks \"Perfect for You\" and \"Gotta Be...Movin' on Up\" to the Marlon Wayans and David Spade comedy \"Senseless\", followed later in the year by P.M. Dawn's fourth album, \"Dearest Christian, I'm So Very Sorry for Bringing You Here. Love, Dad\". It was less successful again, with the album's single, \"Being So Not for You (I Had No Right)\" being a minor chart hit.\n\nIn the same year, Jarret Cordes (DJ Minutemix) was accused of sexually abusing a 14-year old relative and was subsequently arrested in Burlington County. The girl is said to have been a first cousin.\n\nIn 2000, they released the compilation, \"The Best of P.M. Dawn\". Through their website, they also began selling a mail-order-only album called \"Fucked Music\" on December 1, 2000. This was paired with a bonus CD, \"Unreleased Vol. 1\", and a T-shirt.\n\nPrince Be suffered a massive stroke in early 2005 that left him paralyzed on the left side of his body. Undeterred, P.M. Dawn appeared on NBC's \"Hit Me, Baby, One More Time\", performing \"Set Adrift on Memory Bliss\", and covered Puddle of Mudd's \"Blurry\". Despite the fact that Prince Be was still suffering the effects of this stroke, they beat Animotion, Missing Persons, Juice Newton and Shannon to claim the $20,000 charitable prize, which they contributed to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, as Prince Be was a diabetic.\n\nFollowing their appearance on \"Hit Me, Baby, One More Time\", Minutemix was terminated for sexual misconduct. This led to the introduction of the Cordes brothers' paternal first cousin, Gregory Lewis Carr II, known by his stage name Doc. G (also known as 'Dr. Giggles').\n\nDoc. G continues to perform and record music under the P.M. Dawn name. On April 6, 2018, Doc.G announced K-R.O.K. as a new member of P.M. Dawn.\n\nOn June 17, 2016, Attrell Cordes, known within the group as Prince Be, died of renal disease, caused by complications of diabetes, at the age of 46 at a hospital in Neptune City, New Jersey.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2110791", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2110791", "title": "Waroona, Western Australia", "text": "Waroona, Western Australia\n\nWaroona is a town located in the Peel region of Western Australia along the South Western Highway, between Pinjarra and Harvey. The town is the seat of the Shire of Waroona. At the , Waroona had a population of 2,934.\n\nThe town was originally known as Drakesbrook, and was first settled by John Fouracre in 1891. A railway station on the Pinjarra to Picton Junction railway line with the name \"Drake's Brook\", named after William Henry Drake, an Assistant Commissioner General and original landholder in the area (1847), opened in September 1893 and the town was surveyed and gazetted by March 1895. The surveyor-general of the day recommended the name change from Drake's Brook to Drakesbrook as \"it is more euphonious and would look better on the plan\". The change was made official in October 1896, and in the same year a post office was opened.\n\nIn 1895 Joseph McDowell built a timber mill in the northern end of the surveyed townsite at present-day Mill Street, near which a railway siding was opened. Due to the unpopularity of the initial subdivision, new lots were surveyed near the mill, which became known as Waroona. This name was most probably a corruption of Werroona near the Bendigo goldfields in Victoria, believed to be McDowell's hometown. (The original word meant \"resting place\" in the Djadjawurrung language.)\n\nThe town was boosted by the building of the railway, for which local timber was milled for sleepers. It catered to the needs of the mill workers with a post office, general store, school, blacksmith, a number of hotels come boarding houses, churches, doctor and dentist. The farms supplied butter, fruit and vegetables for the men of the mills, and chaff for the horse teams that hauled the logs. In March 1899, McDowell's Siding was converted into Waroona Station, and figures for rail traffic on the South Western Railway reveal that total earnings of outgoing traffic from Waroona was the highest of any station from 1904–47.\n\nDevelopment was confused in the early years as Drakesbrook and Waroona both persisted in usage - in the 1890s referring to the separate towns 2 km apart (of which Waroona was the focus of most major development) but often coming to be used interchangeably. The two settlements gradually merged into one town, which became known as Waroona. The name was officially changed in 1946.\n\nThe first Waroona Dam, now the Drakesbrook Dam, was built in 1931-32 under the guidance of the Waroona Irrigation District by unemployed people on work programmes during the Great Depression. The completion of the dam, together with drainage and irrigation works, were the start of a period of considerable development in Waroona. The present Waroona Dam, further up in the hills, was officially opened in 1966.\n\nThe railway cottages, built in 1896 to accommodate railway employees (until about 1970), and which have survived to the modern day and have been heritage-listed, are the only surviving timber and iron clad platelayers' cottages in Western Australia and are among a very small number of nineteenth-century timber and iron railway houses extant in 2003.\n\nThe local dairy industry included a local Nestlé milk factory, which was functional until the mid-20th century. It has since become a private compound for heavy machinery.\n\nFollowing a lightning strike near Nanga Brook a bushfire broke out that caused extensive damage to bushland, properties and infrastructure in the area including the collapse of the Samson Brook bridge on the South Western Highway. The fire started early on 6 January 2016 and as at 4pm on 7 January it continued to burn out of control with in excess of 21,000 hectares burnt and residents being evacuated to facilities in Pinjarra or Australind. The towns of Yarloop and Harvey were also threatened by the fire with residents urged to evacuate; most of Yarloop was destroyed by it. The town of Preston Beach was isolated with residents sheltering on the beach or evacuated by boat.\n\nWaroona is located on South Western Highway, 113 km south of Perth at the foot of the Darling Range and has a population of about 1,800. Agriculture (including dairying) and tourism are the major economic activities, and an irrigation system from the Drakesbrook Weir waters the town and nearby agricultural areas. Every October the town hosts the Waroona Agricultural Show.\n\nWaroona has a recreation centre and two public sports ovals. Until the 1990s, an abattoir operated from the town, but one in nearby Harvey now fulfils this purpose, and some Waroona residents work there. Shopping needs are met by local businesses and supermarkets. Nearby Waroona Dam and Drakesbrook Weir are now popular tourist/picnic spots and camping grounds, offering activities such as canoeing and water-skiing. Several heritage trails and art and craft shops are also located in Waroona. The shire president is Noel Dew.\n\nThere are two local schools: St Joseph's Primary School (Catholic) and Waroona District High School, which is a primary (elementary) school including kindergarten and junior high school. Senior high school is usually completed by local students in the towns of Pinjarra, Harvey and Mandurah\n\nOn 26 July 2005 the Drakesbrook School House, first opened in 1898 as a one-room school and located in Centennial Park, was burnt down. It had been closed since the 1980s but maintained as a historic site. After police investigations, the remaining structure was removed, but a year later the Council approved a memorial to the school to be built on the site in consultation with the Waroona Historical Society.\n\nThe Waroona Visitor Centre is the location of a local art and craft gallery. Public artwork has been installed around the town site since 1998, as part of the Alcoa and Fremantle Arts Centre \"Art in the Community\" project. These include the \"forest\" of heritage bush poles near the northern tourist information bay, which are jarrah poles that have been carved and painted, as well as a concrete sofa with patchwork quilt, knitted by more than 60 local women, with pieces depicting life in Waroona. The Waroona Heritage Trail – which can be walked or driven – passes by historic buildings and sites, and is marked by artistic bollards. The trail's guidebook is illustrated by sketches of the sites drawn by local artists.\n\nThe main road route through the town is the South Western Highway (Route 20; Perth to Bunbury via Pinjarra and Harvey).\n\nWaroona is located on the South Western Railway and is a stopping place for the \"Australind\" passenger train from Perth to Bunbury.\n\n"}

He guided the Knights to the Louisiana High School Athletic Association Class AAA (the top classification at the time) state championship in 1968. Ferguson succeeded Terry Bradshaw as Woodlawn's starting quarterback.\n\nFerguson played college football at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, where he held the school's single game record for most completions until broken in 2012 (31 against Texas A&M in 1971) and in that same season was named the Southwest Conference's Offensive Player of the Year.\n\nThe Buffalo Bills selected Ferguson in the third round of the 1973 NFL Draft. Although he is most famous for playing with the Bills from 1973 to 1984, Ferguson also played three seasons for the Detroit Lions and two seasons for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and one final season with the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nFerguson placed in the top 10 in pass attempts five times, completions and passing yards four times, passing touchdowns six times, and yards per pass three times. At one time he shared, with Ron Jaworski, the NFL record for consecutive starts by a quarterback with 107, until he was replaced by Joe Dufek on September 30, 1984. He has a 1–3 record in the NFL postseason, winning against the New York Jets in 1981. His three losses came from the Cincinnati Bengals in those same 1981 playoffs, the San Diego Chargers the year before in 1980 (a game in which he played the entire contest with a sprained ankle), and in 1974 to the Pittsburgh Steelers. He retired after the 1990 season after playing only one game with the Colts.\n\nIn 1995, Ferguson briefly came out of retirement to serve as a backup quarterback for the San Antonio Texans of the Canadian Football League's South Division. Kay Stephenson, who had coached Ferguson in his last year in Buffalo, was coach of San Antonio at the time and needed an inexpensive backup who knew Stephenson's system after starter David Archer was injured midseason.\n\nIn 1975 Ferguson tied Fran Tarkenton for the NFL lead with 25 touchdown passes and compiled a passer rating of 81.3. Ferguson also surpassed 20 touchdown passes in three other seasons: 1980, 1981, 1983.\n\nSource:\nSource:\n\n\n\nIn May 2005, Ferguson was diagnosed with Burkitt's lymphoma cancer and underwent treatment at The University of Texas M.

{"id": "2110804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2110804", "title": "Black Donnellys", "text": "Black Donnellys\n\nThe \"Black\" Donnellys were an Irish family who emigrated to Ontario. Five of the family were murdered by an armed mob in the township of Lucan Biddulph in February 1880 and their farm was burned down, the culmination of long-standing conflict between the family and other residents. No one was convicted of the murders, despite two trials.\n\nJames (March 7, 1816 – February 4, 1880) and Johannah (née Magee) Donnelly (September 22, 1823 – February 4, 1880) arrived in Canada from Tipperary, Ireland, with their first child, James Jr.(1842–1877), in 1842. They immigrated to Canada soon afterward, settling as squatters in Biddulph Township in southwestern Ontario. They had seven more children: William Donnelly (1845–1897), John Donnelly (September 16, 1847 – February 4, 1880), Patrick Donnelly - son (1849–1914), Michael Donnelly - son (1850-1879) killed in a pub fight, Robert Donnelly - son (1853–1911) Thomas Donnelly (August 30, 1854 – February 4, 1880) and Jennie \"Jane\" Donnelly - daughter (1857–1917). James' niece, Bridget Donnelly (May 1, 1858 – February 4, 1880) also lived with them.\n\nThe property the Donnelly's settled on originally belonged to the Canada Company which sold it to James Grace. Patrick Farrell had leased part of the lot occupied by the Donnellys. In 1856, owner John Grace brought an action for ejectment in the Court of Common Pleas of Huron County. Squatting was a common North American frontier practice often supported by the courts in the establishment of common law property rights. The judge, recognizing the improvements Donnelly had made to the land during his ten year occupancy, split the lot, awarding Donnelly the north and Farrell the south.\n\nDespite the settlement, hard feelings remained. At a barn raising bee on Saturday, June 27, 1857, James Donnelly and Farrell fought. There are various accounts of what transpired, but in the end Farrell suffered a blow to the head from a handspike thrown by Donnelly, and died two days later. James Donnelly then went into hiding. (\"Farrell's young son was adopted by the Donnellys, and was brought up by them until adulthood\".) Almost two years later, James turned himself in to Jim Hodgins, a sympathetic Justice of the Peace James was sentenced to be hanged on September 17, 1859. A petition for clemency started by his wife Johannah saw his sentence reduced to seven years in Kingston Penitentiary.\n\nThe Donnelly Stagecoach Line is believed to have been started May 24, 1873 by William Donnelly and was a huge success. The line of stages, which ran between London, Lucan and Exeter, was operated by William and his brothers Michael, John, and Thomas, even rivaling the official mail stage that had been in business since 1838.\n\nThe Hawkshaw stage line soon felt the pressure of competition from the Donnellys. In October 1873, Hawkshaw sold his stage to Patrick Flanagan, a husky Irishman, who was determined to drive Donnellys out of business.\n\nThis set the stage for the feud between the Donnelly Stagecoach and the Flanagan & Crawly Stage — the Stagecoach Feud, as it came to be known. Stages were either smashed or burned, horses were savagely beaten or killed, and stables burned to the ground.\n\nThe violence that erupted as a result of the Stagecoach Feud was mostly blamed on the Donnellys and gave the family a bad reputation. From that time on, almost every crime committed was blamed on the family, but although they were charged with numerous crimes, \"few convictions were secured against them\".\n\nIn the buildup towards the murder of the family, the Donnellys became well acquainted with local law enforcement. There are various accounts of assault, arson, trespassing, verbal assault, attempted murder, murder of Patrick Farrell, theft, robbery, assaulting a police officer, as well as various altercations with many residents of the Biddulph Township. \"The Donnellys were not found guilty of everything of which they were accused but through their actions they made many enemies within the township. This all sounds like the Donnellys were a constant source of strife and destruction in their community, but these types of crimes were common for the county in which they lived. It was not just the men of the family who would get into altercations with the law as Johannah was noted to swear at officers quite often, specifically Constable Carroll.\"\n\nIn June 1879 Father John Connolly created a Peace Society/Association in Biddulph. He asked people who attended St. Patrick's Roman Catholic Church to pledge their support. Members of the society agreed to have their homes searched for stolen property. The Donnellys did not sign the pledge. The Vigilance Committee formed out of the Peace Society.\nEvidence indicates that The Biddulph Peace Society or some of its individual members may have been responsible for some of the arson, property damage and physical violence cases in Biddulph.\n\nJohn Connolly was reported to be preaching hatred against Protestants when James stood up in the church and denounced the priest for his hatred, and said his family would from that time go to the Catholic Church in London. The Donnellys had many Protestant friends, many of whom attended their funeral. London Free Press archives. Connolly is reported to have formed the Vigilance Committee that killed the Donnellys.\n\nThe Peace Society's role was to uphold its Code, something the Donnellys were never shy about ignoring. James Donnelly was liberal enough that at one point he even donated money to the building of an Anglican church, outraging the Biddulph Peace Society in the process.\nIn August 1879 a splinter group of the Peace Society began meeting at the Cedar Swamp Schoolhouse in Biddulph. James Carroll was part of the group, as were many of the neighbours of the Donnellys. This group became known as the Vigilance Committee/Society. The Committee was blamed for the murders of the Donnellys.\n\nMembers of the Vigilance Committee allegedly gathered at the Cedar Swamp Schoolhouse late in the evening of February 3, 1880, before proceeding to the Donnelly homestead.\nWilliam Donnelly survived and was listed as the informant on the death certificates for all five, dated April 1 and 2, 1880, with the cause of death listed as \"supposed to be murdered.\"\n\nThere were many feuds associated with the reason behind the death of the Donnellys, however what was considered to be the \"final straw\" is the accusation against the Donnellys of the burning down of Patrick Ryder's barn. \n\nAfter these accusations were disseminated, the community had had \"enough\" of the Donnellys and decided to take the law into their own hands once they heard that there was no supporting evidence linking the Donnellys to the burning of the barn. This news reached the congregation of St. Patrick's Church and the priest addressed that an \"evil had fallen among the community\" and that there would be a reward of five hundred dollars for the \"detection of the wicked persons\" and he vowed that the \"guilty party\" would be punished for their sins. \n\nThere were many considerations as to what was the right form of punishments; some believed fines and jail time would be deemed acceptable. However, others believed that their heads would be the perfect form of punishment.\n\n\"Big\" Jack Kennedy, William Feeheley, Pat Dewan, Heenans (Dennis, Anthony and Michael), John Lanphier, James Harrigan, Ryders (Mr. Ryder, Jim, Patrick Jr., \"Sideroad\" Jim, Thomas and Daniel), McLaughlins (Martin and John), Ted Toohey, John Cain, James Maher, Quigleys (John and Patrick), Patrick Breen, James McGrath, John Purtell, Michael Blake, Ryans (John, Ned and Johnny), William Thompson, John Dorsey, John Bruin, Michael Madigan, James Kenny, and James Carroll.\n\nThe original plan that was generated by the Peace Society was to visit the Donnelly’s family home on the night of February 3rd. \n\nThe plan was to handcuff the Donnelly men and then escort them from the home, where they would be hanged from a tree by their neck until they confessed their crimes against the community. \n\nHowever, one of the problems with their plan was that no one really understood how this would be properly executed. Therefore, this allowed for the plan to be changed or challenged when they arrived on the Donnelly property. \n\nIn the beginning, their original intent was to only \"hurt\" the Donnellys and to \"bring them as near the dissolution point as possible.\" The Peace Society did set up a surveillance of the Donnelly property as a form of preparation in order to determine who was in the home at what times and how they would enter the property in the dark; Jim Feeheley was considered to be one of the spies. \n\nJim Feeheley would visit the Donnelley house earlier in the night as a distraction and to get an understanding on the type of situation they would be encountering that night. There were some more problems associated with these plan such as the society did not plan on Donnelly leaving the Donnelly home and taking his horse to Big Jim Keefe. The society thought Keefe was spying for them and finally they did not plan for Johnny O’Connor to be in the house during the attack.\n\nIt can be said that the day of February 3, began like any other day in the Donnelly household. In the morning, James Donnelly sat down at the kitchen table with his son, Tom, and asked him to write a letter to Alderman Edmund Meredith; the London lawyer that was going to be handling the Donnelly's case against Patrick Ryder. He wrote;\nOnce the letter was delivered, the day carried on as it normally would; at roughly 4 o'clock Johnny, James and Jim returned to their house on Roman Line. This time frame was given by William Casey because he stated that he remembered the sound of the Donnellys speeding down Roman Line and that they were being \"reckless.\" \n\nCasey stopped what he was doing in the front yard, to bear witness to this recklessness that was occurring as well as it was at this point where he noticed the time at which they passed by his home. They had pick up Johnny O'Connor from town, because James Donnelly needed assistance on the farm; this was a normal occurrence. When the chores where completed it was Mr. Donnelly that insisted that Johnny O'Connor stay the night and to sleep in Mr. Donnelly's bed as a form of protection as well as the bed was extremely big. \n\nAs the Donnellys were getting ready for bed, Feeheley stopped by to say \"hello\" before returning home from Whalen's. Feeheley did not stay long; he was just there to observe the property for the Peace Society; however he did not notice that the John Donnelly voice he thought he heard coming from Mr. Donnelly's bedroom was actually Johnny O'Connor voice. However, John Donnelly had gone to Big Jim Keefe to pick up the vehicle in order to travel to their trial in London, Ontario in the morning; he stayed there over night. Once goodbyes, were said the family returned to their bed and fell asleep.\n\nOnce the decision to attack the Donnellys was made, the Peace Society got together at roughly one o’clock in the morning to drink before they mounted the attack on this family; this is referred to as the \"water of life.\" The men used the liquor as a way to numb their senses as well as use it as a way to enhance their courage and their motivation. \n\nOnce the men had had enough alcohol in their system, they began to walk in the direction of the Donnellys' home; there were also many witnesses that stated they could hear the group of men coming down Roman Line that night. When the group of men finally arrived at the house, they surrounded the perimeter of the property and James Carroll took the first step inside the house, which was considered to be the first attack of the massacre; creating an element of surprise. \n\nCarroll walked into the room and slowly took the handcuffs out of his pocket (these were given to him by the Constable Hodgins) and handcuffed Tom Donnelly while he was still asleep. \n\nOnce Tom Donnelly was handcuffed, Carroll did proclaim that \"he was under arrest,\" and at that moment Tom sat up in bed as well as Ms. Donnelly and Bridget Donnelly due to all the commotion. Carroll slowly moved from Tom's bedroom into Mr. Donnelly's bedroom, where he noticed that John Donnelly was nowhere to be found; their plan was to kill all the Donnellys in a single location. \n\nThe commotion woke up Mr. Donnelly and he noticed that his son was handcuffed and proclaimed \"what have you got against us now?\" Carroll responded that they were being charged with another crime. At that moment in time, Tom requested that Carroll read the warrant; since there was no warrant involved, Carroll let out a signal for the men to come storming into the house with their clubs. \n\nAt this point, the men were beginning to beat Mr. Donnelly, Ms. Donnelly and Tom Donnelly; Bridget Donnelly was able to escape and race up the stairs in order to hide from her attackers. Johnny was so terrified that he hid underneath of Mr. Donnelly's bed; since the men were not expecting him to be there that night, they did not know to look for him as a witness. \n\nThe first one to fall to the ground was Mr. Donnelly; he was beaten rapidly and James Maher hit his skull repeatedly causing brain damage; Mrs. Donnelly on the other hand, fought hard against her attackers. However, she was eventually beaten to the ground by Carroll and Tom Donnelly was fighting extremely hard to protect his family as well as himself; he broke free from the attacks and ran towards the front door, as he was running, Tom Ryder was waiting for him with a pitchfork and thrust the sharp points into Tom multiple times. \n\nOnce Tom was limp on the ground, James Maher, Timothy Toohey and Patrick Quigley carried his body back into the house and placed it in the kitchen with his parents as well as Carroll removed his handcuffs from his wrist.\n\n\"\"Hit this fellow on the head with that shovel and break his head open!\"\" \nIt was said that either Jim Toohey or Patrick Quigley bashed Tom's head in three or four times.\n\nOnce Mr. Donnelly, Ms. Donnelly and Tom Donnelly were all laying on the ground, the men realized that Bridget Donnelly was nowhere to be found. A group of men went upstairs and found Bridget hiding and they began to beat her to the point where they were able to bring her limp body down the stairs to where the rest of her family was located. To increase the amount of blood that was shed in a single household, one of the men bashed in the dog's head with a shovel because it would not stop barking. \n\nAfter the group realized that they were missing John Donnelly, they decided to create another plan for that night to rid their community of the Donnellys; they lit the house on fire with the bodies still inside and went hunting for John.\n\nFirearms, pitchfork (Tom Ryder), axe (Purtell), shovel (Pat Quigley and Tim Toohey), clubs and shortened woken stake made of cordwood.\n\nOriginally the massacre was not intended to have any witnesses, however the Peace Society did not intend for Johnny O’Connor to be at the Donnelly's farmhouse and for him to escape the fire. Johnny O’Connor was a young farm boy that had gone to the Donnelly's house to assist them with farm work; it wasn't until later in the night when Mr. Donnelly had encouraged Johnny to spend the night and assist them with the livestock in the morning. The O’Connors were considered to be good friends of the Donnellys and assisted them regularly with chores around their farm; the mob did not take this into consideration when planning their attack.\n\nAt roughly two in the morning, the Peace Society arrived at Whalen Corners; they surrounded the house, in a similar way as they did to the Donnelly's house. However, the difference was the men were not as relaxed as they were in the beginning and they decided to try to get Will Donnelly to come out of the house, instead of storming into the house; they beat his prized stallion in order to lure him out of house from his dying horse's screams. The problem was that the stables were far from the home and no one inside was able to hear what was going on outside, Jim Ryder called for \"Will!\" while carrying a shotgun to the side door of the house. Will Donnelly woke up from the calling for his name, however it was John that opened the door to Will's house and was greeted by gun shots to the chest and groin; thirty holes were placed in his chest that pierced his lung, broke his collarbone and several ribs. John dropped to the ground; McLaughlin and Ryder walked up to the body and placed seven more shots into John as a form of punishment for his action against the community. Norah Donnelly (Will Donnelly's wife) heard the commotion as well as saw John's body on the ground, she tried to pull his body to safety but it was too heavy to move. Will Donnelly hid in the bedroom and was able to peer through a window in order to get a glimpse of the individuals who were attacking the house; John Kennedy and Carroll were only a few feet away from the bed where he was hiding with his wife. He could also place the faces of Big Mike Heenan, William Carroll and Patrick Ryder; the others faces were blurred by darkness. Since Norah could not pull John to safety, Hogan got down on his knees and snuck out to where John was located and pulled him into the bedroom, which left a bloody trail behind him (John Donnelly died five minutes after). The men of the Peace Society were so worn out from their previous attacks that they decided to just survey the perimeter until someone showed their face inside; the members of the household hid in the house for almost three hours before the group decided to leave the property.\n\n\"There's been enough bloodshed tonight boys. Let's go home.\"\n\nThese words spoken by Jim Feeheley ended the massacre, which would have continued to Big Jim Keefe's house.\n\nThere were two trials in London, Ontario, at the courthouse on Ridout Street.\n\nThe preliminary hearings started on February 4, 1880 at McLean's Hotel in Lucan, Ontario. There were three preliminary hearings leading up to the first trial in October 1880. In between the preliminary hearings and the trial, there was a change of venue request, which was ultimately rejected. The crown felt that a fair trial could not be obtained in Middlesex County, as it was too biased against the Donnellys. One of the key witnesses for the prosecution was Johnny O’Conner, who had witnessed the whole massacre. The vigilantes did everything in their power to try to keep Johnny from testifying. Michael O’Conner, Johnny's father, owned two houses on Francis Street, in Lucan. One of the houses was known to have run a bootlegging operation at times, the other house he rented to Bob Donnelly. During the late evening of April 13, the vigilantes burnt the house of O’Conner to the ground. The vigilantes harassed not only the father, but also Johnny's mother, Mary: while she was in London, on one occasion when she passed Patrick \"Grouchy\" Ryder on the street, he threatened and insulted her. She laid a charge against him of using abusive language. At his court appearance, fellow vigilantes swore that he was in Biddulph at the time of the alleged infraction, and this led to his discharge. Young Johnny was not deterred from testifying by any of the group's activities.\n\nThe trial took place on Monday, October 4, 1880 in London, Ontario, with James Carrol being charged with the murder of Johannah Donnelly. The crown prosecutor was Aemilius Irving assisted by James MaGee; the defense consisted of Hugh MacMahon, William Meredith and John Blake. The witness list for the prosecution was as follows; William Donnelly, Nora Donnelly, Martian Hogan, William Blackwell Hock M.D., William Williams, Enoch Murphy, James Feeley, Robert Rojs, John O’Conner, Patrick Whelan, Anne Whelan, Mary Hastings O’Conner, Michael O’Conner, Charles Pope, William Hodge, Henry Phair, and Martin Hogan Jr. The two key witnesses were Johnny O’Conner and William Donnelly. Johnny O’Conner's testimony ran, in part:\n\nTom told him to read the warrant: Carroll said there was lots of time for that: then in a few minutes a whole crowd jumped in and commenced hammering them with sticks and spade; then Tom ran out into the front room and outside: I saw him run out and Bridget ran upstairs and I ran after her and she shut the door and I ran back again in the room and got under the bed behind the clothes basket: then they started hammering Tom outside: the bed was about two feet and an inch high from the floor and no curtains about the bottom of the bed: they carried Tom in the house again: I heard them throw him down on the floor, and heard the handcuffs rattling or whatever they had on his hand: then someone said, \"Hit that fellow with a spade and break his skull open.\" Then the fellow hit his three or four whacks with the spade: when Tom was outside I heard him say, \"Oh! Oh! Oh!\" I did not see them hit Tom with the spade, but heard them; then some of them told the fellow that had the light to bring it here to where Tom was: he brought the light and they were doing something to Tom: they were standing round him: I saw the standing round him: then I saw Thomas Ryder and John Purtell standing near the room door, the bedroom door; then some of them asked where was the girl; another one answered, \"Look upstairs\"; then they went upstairs and saw some of them too, but did not know any of them; then they came down: I heard nothing going on upstairs, and poured coal oil on the bed and set it on fire; it was the bed I was under; I heard someone say that oil would burn off the blanket, and wouldn’t burn at all; then they all run out when they set fire to it; then I got out from under the bed and put on my pants and tried to quench the fire with my coat; I hit the fire with my coat: I then heard Tom breathing, then I went out to the front room and saw Tom dead on the floor; then I ran out to the kitchen and tramped on the old women; there was a light from the fire in my bed, also from Tom’s bed: the door of Tom’s room was open, and the door from the front room into the kitchen: the old women was lying between the door from the front room into the kitchen and the kitchen door going outside; I then ran out and went over to Whalen’s, Pat Whalen, and rapped at Whalen’s door.\n\nHe then went to explain what James Carroll, Thomas Ryder and John Purtell were wearing that night. \"Purtell had dark clothes, Ryder a peaked cap, and Carroll had grey pants; their faces were not blackened: I saw one man with his face blackened, and a long coat on, a middling sized man; Carroll saw me in bed, he looked right at me, and I saw him looking right at me for a while; he did not speak to me: I did not see anyone strike the Donnellys, I only heard them.\"\n\nWilliam Donnelly was another key witness for the prosecution. Here is his testimony.\n\nI was disturbed about half past two by John coming out of his room through my room to the kitchen; he couldn’t go to the kitchen without going through my room; I didn’t speak to John, he said I wonder whose hollering fire and rapping the door, he kept right on and opened the door; when John opened the door going into the kitchen from my room, I heard them holler, \"Fire! Fire! Open the door Will!\" I heard them shouting as soon as I was thoroughly awakened; I heard the door opened; I then heard two shots in rapid succession almost together; John fell back against the door from my bedroom to the kitchen; the distance between the kitchen door and my bedroom is about six or seven feet; his head came down to the jam of the door; I was lying next to the door with the glass top: my wife was sleeping on the outside: there is a stove close to the bed: I turned the side of the blind and looked out: I saw John Kennedy, James Carroll and James Ryder: they were partly in front of the glass window: Kennedy was standing where his name is now marked on the plan about three feet from the door: James Carroll and James Ryder were standing where their names are written on the plan about nine feet from my window: I saw three others outside of the fence, near to the little gate: I calculated that they were Wm. Carroll, Patrick Ryder Jr., and Michael Heenan: I couldn’t swear positively to them; I don’t speak positively as to them; I speak positively as to John Kennedy, James Carroll and James Ryder; these persons are well known to me.\n\nThe defence witnesses were friends and family of the vigilante community, and backed the stories and alibis of each of the members that stood trial. John Purtell, one of the prisoners stated that he was not a member of the committee and had never attended any of the meetings. Instead he was a hired man of James McGrath's and lived with him and never left the house that night. James and his father Matthew backed his story. Prisoner Thomas Ryder said he was a brother of Patrick \"Grouchy\" Ryder and that he spent the night at home playing cards with his brother-in-law Valentine Mackey, his brother James Ryder Sr., and James Toohey. Those named agreed that they played cards and went home to their own places. Prisoner James Ryder Jr. said that he and his five brothers - William, Michael, Patrick Jr., John and Maurice - all spent the night at their father's house. Vigilante Michael Blake said that he also had spent the night there. Prisoner Martin McLaughlin's daughter, Temperance, backed her father's story that he never left the house. Prisoner John Kennedy said he went to Denis Carty's, along with William Hodgins and James Brien for a game of cards. They all left together about 9:15 p.m. Each testified to the same account, with Brien adding that he visited Kennedy at 2:00 a.m. the same night to borrow medicine for a sick family member.\n\nAfter a four and a half hour parley, the foreman of the jury announced that there was no chance of an agreement on a final verdict. One juror declared that he would not have convicted Carroll even if he had seen the killings himself. Another said he did not want to convict Carroll on Johnny O’Conner's word alone. The rest voted for acquittal out of fear for the dozens of others involved. In the end, one jury member was undecided, seven wanted to acquit, and four wanted to convict, resulting in a hung jury.\n\nThe second trial of James Carroll was overseen by Justice Matthew Crook Cameron, who was described as an \"old Tory mugwump\" and past leader of the Ontario Conservative Party. Like Justice J.W. Meredith, he steered the trial to ensure an acquittal of Carroll on February 2, 1881. James Reaney compares the two trials, noting how much smaller the second one seemed and that it lacked the legal conjecture and maneuvering that had marked the first trial.\n\nBefore the trial the lawyers for both sides, Irving and Hutchinson, agreed to keep the trial date close to the New Year so that the jury pool would not have time to be tainted by either side. Nevertheless, the jury consisted entirely of Protestants ruling on an Irish Catholic defendant. The lawyers also agreed to drop William Donnelly's testimony about the death at Whalen's Corners, as it was decided it would not be necessary until the potential trials of five other defendants, which would only take place if James Carroll were convicted.\n\nReaney comes to the conclusion that the prosecution side was hampered throughout the trial as their only hard evidence was the testimony of young O’Conner. While the boy did an admirable job of recollecting the events in a clear manner, Justice Cameron's continual sustaining of the defense's objections hindered the prosecution. This leads Reaney and others to conclude that Cameron was steering the trial in the defense's favor. As a result, much of the evidence that the prosecution presented to help the boy's account was not admitted. Cameron accepted the defense's assertion that the testimony from the O’Conner boy was unreliable and instructed the jury as such, thus giving the prosecution little chance of securing a guilty verdict. This applied in particular to the question of what Johnny O’Conner could have seen if the valances on the bed had been in position. His declaration that they had been removed became a point of debate within the trial, as the London Advertiser recalls. Justice Cameron's instruction to the jury that Johnny's testimony was unreliable eliminated the hard evidence the prosecution needed.\n\nIn the cross-examination of the boy, the defence tried to trip him up on his answers, but the jury and those present in the court room seemed to believe him. As the Toronto Globe accounts, \"His answers were, as a rule, given very promptly and with a fearlessness that did him credit… looking straight into the face of the Crown counsel, seldom looking elsewhere.\" Hugh McMahon questioned Johnny next, first about the gold watch that he was wearing and secondly about the fact that his christened name was Jeremiah and that he was actually 15 years old as records in St. Patrick's parish had indicated. This was to try and discredit the boy's testimony and bring the jury to doubt the reliability of the other testimony. Johnny's godmother came to the rescue regarding his name, explaining that he was christened both Johnny and Jeremiah at birth. Trying to get the courtroom to doubt the boy's testimony never worked for the defence, as most believed he was telling the truth.\n\nWhat fatally weakened the prosecution was the testimony of his mother. The defence persuaded Justice Cameron that the boy's testimony was obtained under duress, as a result of his mother's wanting more money. Justice Armour had rejected this notion in the first trial, but Cameron's decision to accept it meant that the prosecution had little chance. Mrs. O’Conner's testimony fell apart when she failed to accurately tell her boy's correct age, and she was also unable to give a clear explanation for her recent trip to Toronto to visit with the Deputy Attorney General. McMahon used this to show the jury that she was trying to secure more money for the boy's testimony, because her family was struggling to survive after their house had been burnt down. This made her lose her temper and she arrived on the stand already upset after a dispute with fellow witness Mrs. Pat Whalen. She should have explained clearly that her family did need more money and that the provincial bureaucrats were unwilling to provide this, and that was unrelated to the Crown prosecution. Reaney speculates that the bureaucrats did not want to aid a friend of the Donnellys. Mrs. O’Conner's testimony did not go over well and ended any chances the prosecution might have had, with judge, jury and public opinion already at least leaning if not outright against them.\n\nAfter this, much of the same evidence was presented as at the first trial with the same results, with Michael Donnelly maintaining that the valances on the bed had been removed by the time he woke. At the conclusion of the trial the jury convened for three hours before returning a verdict of not guilty. Irving recalled that the jurors before their final meeting had asked whether there was any way Carroll would not be hanged if found guilty and he had responded, \"No.\" This seems to have been the deciding factor ensuring a not guilty verdict.\n\nThe reporters' description of the various witnesses showed that they believed the Donnelly brothers, William and Patrick, to be intelligent, well spoken individuals, and the press had a hard time believing their family were the ruffians the evidence made them out to be. In contrast the press described Carroll and the others as a \"bunch of envious, dangerous, backwoodsmen\" who had a sinister appearance to them. This characterization by the press and their account ensured that while the Donnellys would not get justice in the courtroom, their story would eventually prevail.\n\nThe fact that the community and trial were strongly polarized along religious lines was a factor in the outcome and in the decisions of the judges and lawyers throughout the case. Orlo Miller in his book goes on to implicate the Biddulph Peace Society and members of other societies like the Whiteboys and their influence on the decisions of those in the courtroom. This combined with the lack of hard evidence left the prosecution with no chance of securing a guilty verdict, and possibly not wanting one because of the backlash that could have taken place. Even the crown attorney Charles Hutchinson had written to Aemilius Irving stating that trying to secure a guilty verdict was a \"waste of time and money,\" because of the negative feelings toward the Donnellys in the Middlesex county.\n\nThe publication of Thomas Kelley's \"The Black Donnellys\" in 1954 generated much interest in the case. The family tombstone, with the inscription \"murdered\" was the focus of curiosity and vandalism. Public access to the St. Patrick's Cemetery was denied. Remaining descendants of Donnelly family eventually chose to have the original tombstone replaced.\n\nToday the Donnellys are widely known in Canadian folklore, and the story of their murder is told throughout Canadian and American farming communities. However, despite the popularity of the Donnelly story throughout North America, the inhabitants of Lucan and Biddulph Township have tried to suppress the subject. Up until recently, even among those who were born and raised in the Lucan area, many had never heard the story of the Donnelly massacre until they were adults. Oral accounts of the murders were purportedly suppressed locally due to the number of residents who had ancestors who were directly involved in the circumstances.\n\nIn recent years, several newcomers to the area have started businesses centred on the Donnelly story, creating tourism venues for visitors fascinated by the events surrounding their deaths, much to the dismay of older inhabitants. One of the more well known of these myths is that of the Midnight Lady who supposedly rides up and down the Roman Line every February 4. Another is that the ghosts of the murdered family members can be seen floating in the fields near the murder site and that horses will not ride past the former Donnelly homestead after midnight.\n\nRay Fazakas best illustrates the situation in his book, when he states that despite the fact that the Donnellys have been removed from Biddulph, they have managed to remain alive thanks to Canadian folklore.\n\nWhile for many years the story of the Donnelly massacre \"was\" suppressed in the town of Lucan, in 1995 the Lucan and Area Heritage Society formed to celebrate the heritage of the Lucan area by gathering local, historical artifacts. Over the next few years, interest in the area's heritage increased within the community, and so the collection continued to grow. In 1998, the museum acquired an 1850s log cabin with a very similar floor plan to that of the Donnelly homestead, making it a dramatic setting for visitors to hear the retelling of the Donnelly story, and visualize the tragic events that occurred in the early morning hours of February 4, 1880.\n\nThe Lucan Area Heritage Society, District Lion's Club, and Township of Lucan Biddulph raised over $600,000 for the construction of a new museum building after the University of Western Ontario identified the need for a new museum to spur economic growth in the community. This building reached completion in 2008, and opened to the public in 2009. The new Lucan Area Heritage & Donnelly Museum now highlights the Ray Fazakas Donnelly Collection, rotating exhibits, the \"Donnelly Log Cabin\", and the Hearn barn, which displays a variety of artifacts relating to agriculture in Biddulph in the past 150 years.\n\nStompin' Tom Connors wrote two songs in reference to the Donnelly family: \"The Black Donnellys' Massacre\" and \"Jenny Donnelly\", the latter of which was covered by Chantal Vitalis.\n\nThe Donnellys are one of the subjects of Steve Earle's song \"Justice in Ontario\", (the other subject being a 1978 motorcycle gang murder in Port Hope, Ontario).\n\nGene MacLellan sings a song called \"Death of the Black Donnellys\" on his album \"Lonesome River\", which refers to the Donnellys as Satan's spawn and their killers \"...send them back to Hell\".\n\nIn the 1980s, the London, Ontario punk band The Black Donnellys formed, taking their name from this infamous feud.\n\nIn 2005, Chris Doty wrote \"The Donnelly Trials\", a play he based on the court script where twelve members of the audience become the jury deciding the fate of the defendants with the script providing two separate endings for either a \"Guilty\" or \"Not Guilty\" verdict. The play was performed in the same courtroom in which the actual trial took place.\n\nIn 2007, an NBC television series entitled \"The Black Donnellys\" followed the lives of four Irish brothers and their entrance into organized crime in Hell's Kitchen, New York City. The title is a homage to the infamous family, though the show is otherwise not related to the historical Donnellys.\n\nIn 2012, on October 26 and 27, the Waterford Heritage and Agricultural Museum hosted \"Moonlight & Mayhem ~ The Murder of Michael Donnelly\". This was an outdoor, after dark, theatrical production recreating the gruesome murder of Michael Donnelly which happened at the Commercial Hotel in Waterford. It was a guided walking tour presented twice nightly.\n\nIn 2013, \"The Donnellys\" ran from April 11 until April 20. It was presented by the Owen Sound Little Theatre at the Roxy Theatre in Owen Sound, Ontario. It was a musical drama by Peter Colley and directed by Corry Lapointe.\n\nIn 2015, running from March 7 to 29 at the Citadel Theatre in Edmonton, Catalyst Theatre's production of Vigilante, Jonathan Christenson as writer/director/composer/lyricist. The play is also touring in early 2017.\n\nIn 2017 it was filmed by Aaron Huggett in Ontario, Canada, screenings will be in October 2017.\n\nBlack Donnelly's Brewing Company is based in Mitchell, Ontario.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2110806", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2110806", "title": "Spats (footwear)", "text": "Spats (footwear)\n\nSpats, a shortening of spatterdashes, or spatter guards are a type of classic footwear accessory for outdoor wear, covering the instep and the ankle. Spats are distinct from gaiters, which are garments worn over the lower trouser leg as well as the shoe.\n\nSpats were worn by men and, less commonly, by women in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They fell out of frequent use during the 1920s. Made of white cloth, grey or brown felt material, spats buttoned around the ankle. Their intended practical purpose was to protect shoes and socks from mud or rain, but also served as a feature of stylish dress in accordance with the fashions of the period.\n\nIncreased informality may have been the primary reason for the decline in the wearing of spats. In 1913, friends scrambled to help Griffith Taylor find spats and a top hat to receive the King's Polar Medal from King George V. In 1923 King George V opened the Chelsea Flower Show, an important event in the London Season, wearing a frock coat, gray top hat and spats. By 1926, the King shocked the public by wearing a black morning coat instead of a frock coat (a small but significant change). This arguably helped speed the frock coat's demise (although it was still being worn on the eve of the Second World War). Spats were another clothing accessory left off by the King in 1926. It is said that the moment this was observed and commented on by the spectators it produced an immediate reaction; the ground beneath the bushes was littered with discarded spats.\n\nFrom New York in 1936, the Associated Press observed that \"in recent years well-dressed men have been discarding spats because they have become the property of the rank and file.\" A revival of high-top shoes with cloth uppers was forecast to replace them.\n\nSince the mid-19th century, soldiers of various nations, especially infantry, often wore leggings or spats to protect their lower leg, to keep dirt, sand, and mud from entering their shoes, and to provide a measure of ankle support. French infantry wore white spats for parade and off-duty wear until 1903. Italian soldiers wore a light tan version until 1910, and the Japanese Army wore long white spats or gaiters during the Russo-Japanese War of 1905.\n\nSpats continue as a distinctive feature of the Scottish dress of Highland pipe bands, whether civilian or military. The modern Royal Regiment of Scotland, into which all Scottish line infantry regiments were amalgamated in 2006, retain white spats as part of their uniform. Prior to that date most Scottish infantry units in the British Army and Canadian Army wore spats. For Highland regiments in kilts, spats reached halfway up the calf. For Lowland regiments in trews, spats were visible only over the brogue shoes.\n\nAs part of their parade uniforms, most regiments of the modern Indian and Pakistani armies wear long white spats into which soldiers tuck the bottoms of their trousers. Other full-dress uniforms that still include spats are those of the Finnish Army, Swedish Army, Portuguese Republican National Guard, the Carabiniers of Monaco, the Egyptian Military Police, and the Italian Military Academy of Modena. In the Finnish Navy, spats are part of the winter uniform; and the United States Navy Honor Guard and Rifle Guard wear them while performing ceremonies. Spats are also still used as a traditional accessory in many marching band and drum and bugle corps uniforms in the United States.\n\nSpats remain in use today as personal protective equipment in certain industries. In foundries, pourers wear leather spats over their boots to protect against splashes of molten metal. Even a small splash that lodges in a shoe or between the shoe and ankle could cause a severe burn. Many welders also wear fire-resistant spats for protection from sparks. Casual chainsaw operators often wear protective spats over steel-toe boots, but professionals are now encouraged to wear true chainsaw boots to prevent injury from accidental chainsaw contact with the foot or ankle.\n"}

In 2007, West received an honorary doctorate from NJIT.\n\nAlong with Gerhard Sessler, West invented the foil electret microphone in 1962 while developing instruments for human hearing research. Compared to the previous condenser microphones, the electret microphone has higher capacitance and does not require a DC bias. West and Sessler optimized the mechanical and surface parameters of the system. Nearly 90 percent of more than two billion microphones produced annually are based on the principles of the foil-electret and are used in everyday items such as telephones, camcorders, hearing aids, baby monitors, and audio recording devices among others. West measured the acoustics of Philharmonic Hall in New York City. Recently, West teamed with Ilene Busch-Vishniac and studied the acoustic environment of hospitals showing that hospitals are in general too loud and that the noise levels affect staff and patients.

The album was reissued in 2009 as part of the 3-disc compilation \"\".\n\nThe album was released during a difficult period for Jackson, who was 14 years old at the time, as he had been experiencing vocal changes and facing a changing music landscape. Having been influenced by fellow Motown label mates Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder, Jackson wanted to include his own compositions on the album, but Motown refused to allow this. Jackson would later express his frustrations about this to his father, Joe Jackson, who would later work to terminate Michael's and his brothers' contract with Motown, and negotiate lucrative contracts for them with Epic Records.\n\nSince Jackson was on a world tour with his brothers as a member of The Jackson 5, promotion on this album was limited. The Stevie Wonder cover, \"With a Child's Heart\", was released as a single in the United States, where it reached on the Billboard R&B Singles chart and on the \"Billboard\" Pop Singles chart. Two additional songs (\"Music and Me\" and \"Morning Glow\") were released as singles in the UK, but they failed to chart. Another track, \"Too Young\", was released as a single in Italy, while the track \"Happy\" was a single in Australia and \"Doggin' Around\" was a limited-release single in the Netherlands. Ten years after this album's release, \"Happy\" was released as a single in the UK to promote Motown's \"18 Greatest Hits\" compilation album.

{"id": "2110836", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2110836", "title": "Water injection (engine)", "text": "Water injection (engine)\n\nIn internal combustion engines, water injection, also known as anti-detonant injection (ADI), can spray water into the incoming air or fuel-air mixture, or directly into the cylinder to cool certain parts of the induction system where \"hot points\" could produce premature ignition. In jet engines it increases engine thrust at low speeds and at takeoff.\n\nWater injection was used historically to increase the power output of military aviation engines for short durations, such as dogfights or takeoff. However it has also been used in motor sports and notably in drag racing. In Otto cycle engines, the cooling effects of water injection also enables greater compression ratios by reducing engine knocking (detonation). Alternately, this reduction in engine knocking in Otto cycle engines means that some applications gain significant performance when water injection is used in conjunction with a supercharger, turbocharger, or modifications such as aggressive ignition timing.\n\nDepending on the engine, improvements in power and fuel efficiency can also be obtained solely by injecting water. Water injection may also be used to reduce NOx or carbon monoxide emissions.\n\nWater injection is also used in some turbine engines and in some turboshaft engines, normally when a momentary high-thrust setting is needed to increase power and fuel efficiency.\n\nWater has a very high heat of vaporization. As the ambient temperature water is injected into the engine, heat transfers from the hot cylinder head and intake air into the water. This makes it evaporate, cooling the intake charge. A cooler intake charge means it is more dense (higher volumetric efficiency) and also has a lower tendency to knock. However, the water vapour displaces some air, negating some of the denser intake charge benefit. Knocking is generally more of a problem in forced induction engines rather than naturally aspirated, so this can help prevent it. On electronic ignition systems the ignition timing is generally retarded to prevent knock from occurring but with water injection it can be advanced closer to maximum brake torque (MBT) timing for additional power.\n\nMany water injection systems use a mixture of water and alcohol (often close to 50/50), with trace amounts of water-soluble oil. The water provides the primary cooling effect due to its great density and high heat absorption properties. The alcohol is combustible, and also serves as an antifreeze for the water. The main purpose of the oil is to prevent corrosion of water injection and fuel system components; it may also assist in engine lubrication when running in a high power state. Because the alcohol mixed into the injection solution is often methanol (CHOH), the system is known as methanol-water injection, or MW50. In high performance automotive applications the use of 100% methanol as opposed to a water-methanol mixture is referred to simply as methanol injection. Safety concerns and part longevity concerns keep this as a controversial option. In the United States, the system is also commonly referred to as anti-detonant injection, or ADI.\n\nIn a piston engine, the initial injection of water cools the fuel-air mixture significantly, which increases its density and hence the amount of mixture that enters the cylinder. The water (if in small liquid droplets) may absorb heat (and lower the pressure) as the charge is compressed, thus reducing compression work. An additional effect comes later during combustion when the water absorbs large amounts of heat as it vaporizes, reducing peak temperature and resultant NO formation, and reducing the amount of heat energy absorbed into the cylinder walls. This also converts part of combustion energy from the form of heat to the form of pressure. As the water droplets vaporize by absorbing heat, they turn to high pressure steam. The alcohol in the mixture burns, but is also much more resistant to detonation than gasoline. The net result is a higher octane charge that supports very high compression ratios or significant forced induction pressures before onset of detonation.\n\nCertain other engines can benefit far more from the use of water injection. Typical pulse jet engines have extremely poor fuel efficiency, specific fuel consumption, and thrust. Water injection has been proven to use the waste heat that causes a pulse jet to glow red hot and convert it into thrust. It cools the engine, it pulls more air in, and it reduces pollution. Water injection and other means of boost may be able to transform the pulse jet from a noisy, inefficient tube to a cleaner burning and powerful enough engine that may be of use in lightweight aircraft.\n\nFuel economy can be improved with water injection. Depending on the engine, the effect of water injection, with no other modification, like leaning out the mixture, may be quite significant.\nIn some cases water may also reduce CO emissions. This may be attributable to the water gas shift reaction, in which CO and HO shift to form CO and H. However, water may also increase hydrocarbon emissions, possibly due to an increased quenching layer thickness.\n\nControl over the water injection is important. It must be injected only when conditions within the engine would otherwise be sufficient to cause detonation or other undesirable effects. This normally occurs when the engine is heavily loaded and running at full power, however may occur outside of these times in specialized engines or applications. Otherwise injecting water cools the combustion process unnecessarily, resulting in negative effects such as reduced efficiency or power.\n\nDirect injection of water is possible and is likely advantageous. In a piston engine, this may be done at any point in the engine's cycle, depending on the desired effect, even late in the power stroke or during the exhaust stroke when used only to reduce engine temperatures.\n\nMost modern consumer vehicle engines are pre-programmed with specific fuel-to-air ratios, so introducing water without re-programming the car's computer or otherwise changing these ratios will most likely provide no benefit, and may likely reduce performance or damage the engine. In addition, most modern fuel systems cannot determine that water in any form has been added, and cannot determine a new compression ratio or otherwise take advantage of lower cylinder temperatures. In most cases in pre-programmed cars, introducing water vapor via an indirect water injection method causes loss of power because the water vapor takes the place of air (and fuel in engines with either a carburetor or single point injection) that is required to complete the combustion process and produce power. Normally, only vehicles re-tuned for water injection see any benefits.\n\nDamage can occur to the engine if too much water is injected or if the injector itself malfunctions. Water is not compressible, and too much water in the cylinder prior to, or during, the compression cycle can cause a condition called hydrolock, where the volume of liquid in the engine is close to or greater than the volume between piston and head (or between pistons in a opposed piston engine) of the engine at top dead center, resulting in extremely high cylinder pressure that may cause blown heads, shattering of the piston, connecting rods or other damage to the engine. This damage is normally fatal to the engine and typically requires a full rebuild or engine replacement.\n\nWater injection is typically used in aviation and was not initially intended for use in consumer grade vehicles. When used in consumer grade vehicles it is normally for the extremely high performance arena (1000 HP+) where vehicles are supercharged or turbocharged and produce excessive heat. These vehicles are typically driven only in an event or controlled race and require extremely high levels of knowledge to maintain and are only driven for very short distances. In most forms of water injection, water is mixed with a combustible fuel rather than being used in isolation.\n\nMany product scams exist touting that inserting a tube of misting spray into an intake manifold increases mileage or horsepower. However, unless the user reprograms the car's ECU or performs major modifications to the engine, power loss and damage may eventually occur.\n\nWater injection has been used in both reciprocating and turbine aircraft engines. When used in a turbine engine, the effects are similar, except that normally preventing detonation is not the primary goal. Water is normally injected either at the compressor inlet or in the diffuser just before the combustion chambers. Adding water increases the mass being accelerated out of the engine, increasing thrust, but it also serves to cool the turbines. Since temperature is normally the limiting factor in turbine engine performance at low altitudes, the cooling effect lets the engine run at higher RPM with more fuel injected and more thrust created without overheating. The drawback of the system is that injecting water quenches the flame in the combustion chambers somewhat, as there is no way to cool the engine parts without also cooling the flame. This leads to unburned fuel out the exhaust and a characteristic trail of black smoke.\n\nPiston-engined petrol military aircraft used water injection technology prior to World War II to increase takeoff power. This was used so that heavily laden fighters could take off from shorter runways, climb faster, and quickly reach high altitudes to intercept enemy bomber formations. Some fighter aircraft also used water injection for a boost in short bursts during dogfights.\n\nAs a general rule, the fuel mixture is set at full rich on an aircraft engine when running it at high power settings (such as during takeoff). The extra fuel does not burn; its only purpose is to evaporate to absorb heat. This uses fuel faster and also decreases the efficiency of the combustion process. By using water injection, the cooling effect of the water lets the fuel mixture run leaner at its maximum power setting. Many military aircraft engines of the 1940s utilized a pressure carburetor, a type of fuel metering system similar to a throttle body injection system. In a water-injected engine, the pressure carburetor features a mechanical \"derichment valve\" that makes the system nearly automatic. When the pilot turns on the water injection pump, water pressure moves the derichment valve to restrict fuel flow to lean the mixture while at the same time mixing the water/methanol fluid into the system. When the system runs out of fluid the derichment valve shuts and cuts off the water injection system, while enriching the fuel mixture to provide a cooling quench to prevent sudden detonation.\n\nDue to the cooling effect of the water, Otto cycle aircraft engines with water injection can be made to produce more power through higher charge densities at the time of combustion. The additional charge density is typically achieved by allowing higher manifold pressures before the onset of detonation. This is normally done by adding or increasing the amount of forced induction or further opening of the throttle. However a similar result may be achieved via higher engine stoke. This has historically been the primary use of a water injection systems in aircraft.\n\nThe extra weight and complexity added by a water injection system was considered worthwhile for military purposes, while it is usually not considered worthwhile for civilian use. The one exception is racing aircraft, which focus on making a tremendous amount of power for a short time. In this case, the disadvantages of a water injection system are less important.\n\nWater injection use in turbine engines has been limited, again, mostly to military aircraft. Many pictures are available of Boeing B-52 takeoffs that clearly show the black smoke emitted by turbine engines running with water injection. For early B-52s, water injection was seen as a vital part of take-off procedures. For later versions of the B-52 as well as later turbine-powered bombers, the problem of taking off heavily loaded from short runways was solved by the use of more powerful engines that had not been available previously.\n\nEarly versions of the Boeing 707 fitted with Pratt & Whitney JT3C turbojets used water injection for extra takeoff power, as did Boeing 747-100 and 200 aircraft fitted with Pratt & Whitney JT9D-3AW and -7AW turbofans; this system was not included in later versions fitted with more powerful engines. The BAC One-Eleven airliner also used water injection for its Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan engines. Filling the tanks with jet fuel instead of water led to the Paninternational Flight 112 crash.\n\nA limited number of road vehicles with forced induction engines from manufacturers such as Chrysler have included water injection. The 1962 Oldsmobile F85 was delivered with the Fluid-Injection Jetfire engine, which, incidentally, shares the title of \"the world's first turbocharged road car\" with the Corvair Spyder. Oldsmobile referred to the water/alcohol mixture as 'Turbo-Rocket Fluid'. Saab offered water injection for the Saab 99 Turbo. With the introduction of the intercooler the interest in water injection to prevent detonation almost disappeared, but recently water injection has also been of interest because it can potentially decrease nitrogen oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions in exhaust. However the most common use of water injection today is in vehicles with high performance aftermarket forced induction systems (such as turbochargers or superchargers); such engines are commonly tuned with a narrower margin of safety from detonation and hence benefit greatly from the cooling effects of vaporized water.\n\nIn 2015 BMW has introduced a version of their high performance M4 coupe, the M4 GTS, that combines water injection with intercooling. The car was featured in the 2015 MotoGP season as the official safety car for the series and was released for the commercial market in 2016. As per BMW example, current engine developments featuring water injection seem to concentrate on the effect of “Performance Improvement”. But by the mid 2020s, engine development will shift focus also on improved fuel consumption, due to the pressure on CO2 emissions reduction and related regulations.\n\nBosch, which co-developed the technology with BMW, offers a water injection system named WaterBoost for other manufacturers. The company claims up to 5% increase in engine performance, up to 4% decrease in CO emissions and up to 13% improvement in fuel economy. Similar results were published by FEV showing up to 5,3% Fuel Efficiency improvement on 2,0L displacement petrol engine and even up to more than 7% in combination with cooled exhaust gas recirculation, depending of the drive cycle considered.\n\nWater Injection and cooled exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) could be seen as competitive technologies: it has been demonstrated that at medium load a 40-50 % Water-to-Fuel Ratio (WFR) with Port Water Injection (PWI) has the same effect as an EGR-rate of 10%, which is seen as relatively limited even for petrol engines. However, Water Injection has some benefits when compared to EGR, especially a better controllability as this is not a closed-loop as EGR, the timing of injection is not linked to other parameters as turbo charger backpressure, limited inertia (PWI timing not linked to engine operation) and combustion delay (as present with EGR). Additionally it does not deteriorate combustion stability significantly. The combustion delay linked to EGR dilution and the necessary adaption of the recirculated gas mass flow to the maximum turbocharger characteristics are typically two limiting parameters of the max. acceptable EGR rate. Therefore, some synergies can be developed when using Water Injection in area of the engine map where EGR is typically not possible (High Load / High Speed).\n\nSurveys asking customers about their willingness to regularly fill up an additional operating fluid have demonstrated that the acceptance level is limited. Therefore, the need for refilling is considered as one of the main barrier for the mass adoption of Water Injection. A key enabler is the development of on-board water generation system to run in close loop system, especially in order to guarantee consistent low level of emissions (engine C02 emissions to raise if run without water supply). Three major sources can be investigated:\nThe first two variants are highly dependent on weather ambient conditions with sufficiently high humidity levels or driver habits (no A/C operation wanted). Consequently, an adequate supply of water cannot be ensured. On the contrary, condensing of water vapour formed during the combustion of gasoline is a reliable source of water: there is approximately a volume of 1L of water vapour in exhaust per each liter of gasoline fuel consumed. \nIn October 2019, Hanon Systems together with FEV, presented an Audi TT Sport demonstrator equipped with port Water Injection operating in close systems thanks to an Hanon Systems equipment called \"Water Harvesting System\". The fully packageable system was able in the most critical cases tested to condensate more than 2 times the water consumed. The quality of the water condensates was presented as being good enough to avoid problems with injectors and potential corrosion issues were not detected during the extensive test drives. the condensates were shown as transparent, without strong odour and color.\n\nA 2016 study combined water injection with exhaust gas recirculation. Water was injected into the exhaust manifold of a diesel engine and, by opening the exhaust valve during the induction stroke, the injected water and some of the exhaust gas was drawn back into the cylinder. The effect was to reduce NOx emissions by up to 85% but at the cost of increased soot emissions.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2110844", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2110844", "title": "China Can Say No", "text": "China Can Say No\n\nChina Can Say No () is a 1996 Chinese language non-fiction manifesto written and edited by Song Qiang, Zhang Zangzang (whose original name is Zhang Xiaobo), Qiao Bian, Tang Zhengyu, and Gu Qingsheng. It was published in China and strongly expresses Chinese nationalism. Its full title is often translated as The China That Can Say No: Political and Emotional Choices in the post Cold-War era. It became an overnight bestseller, as the authors called on the Beijing government to stand up against the United States in a new era of global competition. In addition the book bashes Japan for defection from Asia in favor of an American connection. The popularity indicates the growth of anti-American and anti-Japanese sentiment in the Chinese public. It indicates disillusionment among many younger and better educated Chinese as the nation searches for a major role in the global economic and political systems. The Beijing government originally endorsed the general thesis, but after sharp criticism from the United States and Asia, the government condemned the book as an irresponsible source of confusion, and banned it from circulation. \n\nZhang Xiaobo, one of the authors of \"China Can Say No\", is a former student radical and \"uncritical admirer of all things American\". His disillusionment with foreign countries' treatment of China, and particularly that by America, reflects the experience of about a quarter of Chinese students studying in the United States, who despite initially feelings of Americophilia, undergo a surge in pro-China patriotism following the experience. Contributing factors to this transformation include feelings of racial discrimination while in the United States, a denial of Chinese culture's legitimacy by Americans, and negative images of China from the American media.\n\nThe book, which is modelled on \"The Japan That Can Say No\", argues that many \"fourth-generation\" Chinese embraced Western values too strongly in the 1980s and disregarded their heritage and background. All of the authors were strong critics of Chinese government and Deng Xiaoping's neoliberal reforms, and at least two of the authors participated in the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Another author was sentenced to seven years in jail by the Chinese government in the 1980s for his pro-democracy activities, though he was released after only serving three years. The book specifically criticizes a number of activists such as physicist Fang Lizhi and journalist Liu Binyan.\n\nDescribing a disenchantment among Chinese with the US starting in the 1990s, especially after it adopted a China containment strategy, rejected China's bid for the World Trade Organization, and worked against China's bid for the 2000 Summer Olympics, the authors criticize US foreign policy (in particular, support for Taiwan) and American individualism. The book deplores unfair treatment of China by the US (as symbolized by the Yinhe Incident of 1993). It claims that China is used as a scapegoat for American problems and voices support for such governments as that of Fidel Castro's Cuba which openly declare their opposition to the US. The book also focuses on Japan. It accuses Japan of being a client state of the US, argues that Japan should not get a seat on the United Nations Security Council, and supports a renewed call for war reparations to China from Japan for its actions in the Second Sino-Japanese War.\n\nA Japanese translation by Mo Bangfu and Suzuki Kaori was published in 1996 by Nikkei. No English translation has been published.\n\nIn 2009, \"Unhappy China\", a follow-up version, was published.\n\n"}

At Mississippi State, Hull earned four football letters as the Bulldogs' center from 1979 to 1982 before going on to star first in the USFL then in the NFL.\n\nHull was the starting center for the Generals from 1983 to 1985 where he blocked for Herschel Walker all 3 years. Walker broke the pro football record for rushing yards in a single season with 2,411 in 1985 with the Generals - Hull was a key cog in their attack all three seasons together.\n\nAs a rookie for the Buffalo Bills in 1986, Hull immediately became their starting center, replacing Will Grant, hunched between 7-year veteran Jim Ritcher at left offensive guard and fellow rookie Will Wolford at right guard for all 16 games, with Hall-of-Famer Jim Kelly as rookie quarterback under first-year head coach Marv Levy. In 1988, the Bills won the AFC east division with a strong offensive line, Hull playing between Ritcher and Tim Vogler at right guard. They beat the Houston Oilers in the divisional round of the 1988–89 NFL playoffs, as Kelly passed for 244 yards and Thurman Thomas rushed for 75 yards in only 7 carries, but lost the AFC championship game to the Cincinnati Bengals. In 1989, the Bills won the AFC east division title again but lost a divisional round match of the 1989–90 NFL playoffs to the Cleveland Browns.\n\nIn 1990, the Bills won the AFC east division again, beating the Miami Dolphins in the divisional round of the 1990–91 NFL playoffs, destroying the Los Angeles Raiders 51–3 in the AFC championship game, but barely losing to the Bill Parcells-led New York Giants in Super Bowl XXV 20–19. In 1991, the Bills won the AFC east division again, beating the Kansas City Chiefs in the divisional round of the 1991–92 NFL playoffs, the Denver Broncos in the AFC championship game but losing to the Joe Gibbs-led Washington Redskins in Super Bowl XXVI. One more year of joy and frustration occurred in 1992, when the Bills won the AFC east division title again, beating the Houston Oilers in a wild-card game of the 1992–93 NFL playoffs, the Pittsburgh Steelers in the divisional round, the Miami Dolphins in the AFC championship game, but losing to the Jimmie Johnson-led Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl XXVII. More joys and frustrations occurred in 1993, when the Bills won the AFC east division title again, beating the Los Angeles Raiders in the divisional round of the 1993–94 NFL playoffs, the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC championship game (rushing for 229 yards, 186 by Thomas), but losing to the Johnson-led Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl XXVIII.\n\nThe Bills ran out of gas in 1994, finishing only with a won-lost record of 7–9. But in 1995, the Bills came back to prominence by winning the AFC east divisional title to beat the Dolphins in a wild-card game of the 1995–96 NFL playoffs, rushing for a ridiculous 334 yards, as Hull mauled the opposing defensive tackles Tim Bowens and Chuck Klingbeil as thoroughly as middle linebacker Bryan Cox, but they lost a divisional round game to the Steelers. In 1996, Hull's final year in the NFL, the Bills made the playoffs but lost a wild-card game to the Jacksonville Jaguars. In 1997, he was replaced by sophomore Dusty Zeigler.\n\nFrom 1986 to 1993, he played next to Ritcher at left guard, forming a fine tandem in their hurry-up offense, and in the final two years with a very strong Ruben Brown. During Hull's 11-year career in Buffalo, he played in 121 consecutive games from 1986 to 1993, as the Bills enjoyed eight winning seasons and won four consecutive AFC titles. Named to the Pro Bowl three times, he was also one of the team's captains for his final seven years. Most notably, he was the starting center for Buffalo during their record four straight Super Bowl appearances from 1990 to 1993.\n\nHull was selected to the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame in 1997, inducted into the Mississippi State University Sports Hall of Fame in 2000, received the Ralph C. Wilson Distinguished Service Award in 2001, was selected to the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame in 2002 and was the 19th inductee to the Wall of Fame at Ralph Wilson Stadium in Buffalo in 2002. In 2012, he was added to Mississippi State University's Ring of Honor on Davis Wade Stadium, which is the highest recognition for Mississippi State Football. In 2013, the Kent Hull Trophy was announced and is to be given annually to the best collegiate offensive lineman in the State of Mississippi. The first annual recipient was announced on November 27, 2013 to offensive guard Gabe Jackson of Mississippi State.\n\nHull died at home in Greenwood, Mississippi on October 18, 2011. The cause was announced as a gastrointestinal bleed stemming from chronic liver disease, a condition which he had been battling for some time. A review of his career was published in the New York Times of November 7, 2011.\n"}

Holmes, it was built in 1856 and housed the school's classrooms, offices and laboratories, the school's library/museum, and a multifunction lecture hall/chapel. Along with Saints' Rest, and a horse barn, it was one of three buildings completed when the college opened for classes in 1857.\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, College Hall had outlived its usefulness, and its future was in doubt. Because Michigan state government officials had taken the lowest construction bid possible, College Hall suffered from an extraordinary number of construction defects. These included hollow bricks, doors that would not open, a leaky roof (replaced by student labour in the first year), soft pine floorboards that shrank so they did not reach the walls, and even a tree stump embedded in the foundation. The College considered demolishing the historic edifice, but students organized a campaign to save it from the wrecking ball. They convinced the college to convert the hall into a student union.\n\nThe college went forward with plans to save the structurally unsound building, but it was beyond preservation. The renovation weakened the shoddily built structure, and in August 1918, the building collapsed while a marching band played \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" outside the building. No one was injured in the collapse. After the College cleared away the debris, they entertained several proposals to replace College Hall, but in the end they erected a clock tower on the northeast corner of the site. Beaumont Tower became the new architectural symbol of Michigan State College. Nevertheless, College Hall was not forgotten; to this day it is featured on the great seal of Michigan State University.\n\n\n"}

Cooney (born July 16, 1959) is a former member of the administration of United States President George W. Bush. Before being appointed to chair the Council on Environmental Quality, he was a lawyer and lobbyist for the American Petroleum Institute.\n\nPrior to working for the Bush Administration, Cooney was a lawyer and lobbyist for the American Petroleum Institute (API), an industry group representing the American petroleum industry.\n\nCooney joined the George W. Bush administration when he was appointed chief of staff of the Council on Environmental Quality. On June 10, 2005, Cooney announced his resignation, two days after the story of his tampering with scientific reports broke. It was reported that he had altered government climate reports to downplay scientific consensus about climate change. A few days later, it was announced that Cooney would go to work for the petroleum (oil) company ExxonMobil starting in the fall; ExxonMobil declined to describe the nature of Cooney's new job.\n\nIn early 2005, Rick S. Piltz resigned from his position as a senior associate in the U.S. Climate Change Science Program, saying that Cooney had been editing government climate reports to emphasize doubts about global warming. According to Piltz's resignation letter, Cooney edited documents to \"create an enhanced sense of scientific uncertainty about climate change and its implications.\"\n\nOn June 3, 2002, Myron Ebell wrote a memo to Cooney that was obtained by Greenpeace through an FOI request in 2003, explaining how they were going to deal with the publication of the Climate Action Report 2002 by attacking United States Environmental Protection Agency chair Christine Todd Whitman, adding that he was helping to \"drive a wedge between the President and those in the Administration who think they are serving the president's best interests by publishing this rubbish.\"\n\nOn August 11, 2003, Maine Attorney General G.

He also inquired about the lawsuit the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) had filed on August 6, 2003 against the administration under the little-used Data Quality Act to invalidate the National Assessment of the Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change, which formed the basis for many of the conclusions in the Climate Action Report. Lieberman charged that the suit was apparently an attempt to have the National Assessment (and therefore the Climate Action Report) withdrawn.\n\nOn June 8, 2005, \"The New York Times\" said that it had obtained internal White House documents which proved that Cooney had unilaterally edited the national climate change reports during 2002 and 2003 to water down its conclusions.

His compositions are inspired by American Indian history and culture, and he makes use of traditional instruments.\n\nHe has had several commissioned works, which have been performed by major orchestras in Washington, DC; San Francisco, Detroit, and Minneapolis, among others. When the San Francisco Symphony Chorus performed and recorded his work \"Iholba' \" in 2008, it was the first time the chorus had sung any work in Chickasaw or any American Indian language.\n\nTate has also worked to develop younger musicians and composers. He is founder and artistic director of the Chickasaw Chamber Music Festival. He was Co-Founder and Composition Instructor for the Chickasaw Summer Arts Academy. He has served as composer-in-residence. Since 2011 he has been an adjunct instructor on the music faculty of Oklahoma City University.\n\nJerod Sheffer Impichchaachaaha' Tate was born in 1968 in Norman, Oklahoma, and is an enrolled citizen of the Chickasaw Nation. With both parents involved in music, theatre and dance, he grew up immersed in classical music. His father, Charles Tate (Chickasaw), is a classically trained pianist and baritone, who played at home as well as in professional performance. Through his paternal grandmother, Jerod Tate is part of the Shawi clan. His mother, Dr. Patricia Tate, is of Manx Irish descent. She was a professor of dance and a choreographer. His parents recognized and nurtured Jerod's musical talent. His parents were influential in encouraging his work in music. By accompanying his father to tribal events, Jerod heard much American Indian music among the peoples of Oklahoma.\n\nHis Chickasaw middle name, \"Impichchaachaaha’\", means “high corncrib.” It is his inherited traditional Chickasaw \"house name,\" traditionally used in a manner similar to a European-American surname. A corncrib is a small hut used for the storage of corn and other vegetables. In traditional Chickasaw culture, the corncrib was built high off of the ground on stilts to keep its contents safe from foraging animals.\n\nTate received his BM in Piano Performance from Northwestern University, where he studied with Dr. Donald J. Isaak. He received his MM in Piano Performance and Composition from the Cleveland Institute of Music, where he studied with Elizabeth Pastor and Dr. Donald Erb.\n\nShortly before Tate began his piano studies at the Cleveland Institute of Music, his mother Dr. Patricia Tate commissioned his first composition, asking him for a ballet score. He wrote \"Winter Moons,\" exploring traditions of the tribes from the Northern Plains and Rockies. It premiered at the University of Wyoming in 1992. He found composition to be a way to combine American Indian tradition and classical training. The Colorado Ballet subsequently performed this ballet in 1994 and 1996.\n\nTate later commented about the experience of composing this work: \n\"I didn't mix my identities of being a classically trained musician and being an American Indian. I never saw that there was even a possible relationship between those two until I started composing. And that's when they came together in a way that made me feel just wonderful.\"After this, he returned to the Cleveland Institute of Music and initiated his second major, in composition, in addition to piano studies. He also worked with his father and others to study Chickasaw music more deeply.\n\nTate has said an important influence was Hungarian composer Béla Bartók, saying he was ”the first ethnomusicologist that was aware of his own folk music; he did it so naturally and so joyfully that I felt the same impulse to do the same thing from where I come from.”\n\nIn 1994 Dr. Bill Burkhardt held a convention in Boulder, Colorado about and with American Indian composers, who have made innovations by working with traditional instruments and forms within classical music structure. The American Composers Forum, based in Minneapolis and working to support the composition of new music, implemented the First Nations Composers Initiative (FNCI). FNCI has commissioned several works from North American Indian composers. FNCI is no longer active. The American Composers Forum itself has commissioned three large-scale works from Tate.\n\nTate's works have been commissioned and performed by the National Symphony Orchestra, The San Francisco Symphony and San Francisco Symphony Chorus, The Detroit Symphony, the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra, the South Dakota Symphony Orchestra, Colorado Ballet, Canterbury Choral Society, among others. Tate has said that he works with \"sound icons,\" comparing his use of traditional flutes and drums, to the way that visual artists explore iconic images associated with American Indians: feathers, horses, etc.\n\nIn 2007 the San Francisco Symphony and San Francisco Symphony Chorus performed and recorded his \"Tracing Mississippi\" and \"Iholba',\" released together in 2008. This was the first time the chorus had sung any work in Chickasaw or in any American Indian language. Tate said they took on the challenge just like learning how to sing in any other language.\n\nTate worked with the noted musician, R. Carlos Nakai, composing \"À Bec Quintet\" (2009), a woodwind quintet for him. Nakai premiered it at the Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival.\n\nIn a program on American Indian classical music and composers, NPR noted that some tribes have funded education programs and other initiatives for young composers. Tate is among musicians who have developed institutions for the performance and composition of music by American Indians. He is founder and artistic director of the Chickasaw Chamber Music Festival. He was Co-Founder and Composition Instructor for the Chickasaw Summer Arts Academy.\n\nIn 2009, Tate conceived, coordinated and implemented the CD project \"Oshtali: Music for String Quartet.\" The album consists of original compositions by his students from the Chickasaw Summer Arts Academy; it is the first professional recording in history of works by young American Indian composers. A second CD recording from the Chickasaw Summer Arts Academy, entitled \"Tobachi,\" was released in 2013. The third CD recording, entitled \"Taloowa' Chokma'si\"', was released in 2016. All three recordings were recorded, produced, and released on the Grammy Award-winning label, Azica Records.\n\nHe has also served as composer-in-residence. In 1997, Tate was Composer-in-Residence for the Kennedy Center for Performing Arts/National Symphony Orchestra American Residency Program in the state of Wyoming. In 2004 and 2005, Tate was Composer-in-Residence for the Grand Canyon Music Festival’s Native American Composer Apprentice Project. In 2007, he was Composer-in-Residence for The Joyce Foundation/American Composers Forum, teaching composition to American Indian high school students in Minneapolis. In 2011 Tate was selected as Composer-Mentor of the 2012 Essentially Choral program supported by the Jerome Foundation.\n\nIn 2011 Tate joined the Bass School of Music at Oklahoma City University as an adjunct instructor of orchestration.\n\nIn reviewing a performance of \"Iholba’ (The Vision), for Solo Flute, Orchestra and Chorus,\" which was commissioned by the National Symphony Orchestra and premiered at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, \"The Washington Post\" said, “Tate’s connection to nature and the human experience was quite apparent in this piece...rarer still is his ability to effectively infuse classical music with American Indian nationalism.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It also features several hit songs from 1975 and two hit singles from Elton's last year of performing in 1976.\n\nThere are several versions of the album. There were two original versions, one in the United States and Canada and another for Great Britain and the rest of the world, both released in 1977. The British version, released on DJM Records, included \"Bennie and the Jets\", a song that had appeared on the 1973 album \"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\" but had only recently been released as a single (1976) in Elton John's home country. In North America, where the album was released by MCA Records, this song had already appeared on the first volume of \"Greatest Hits\". It was replaced with \"Levon\", an even older song (from 1971's \"Madman Across the Water\" album) that had not yet been collected.\n\nThe album also contained two songs that would later be replaced, \"Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word\" and \"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\" both from 1976. These were the newest songs on the collection, and the only two not owned by DJM/This Record Company. They had been released on Elton John's own label named The Rocket Record Company and were owned by his own royalty collection company, Sackville Productions. They appeared on this DJM album by mutual agreement. In North America, all his records were released by MCA (the singles from 1976 as well as the \"Blue Moves\" album also carried the Rocket logo), so, at that time, no agreement was necessary.\n\nThe original album contained a booklet containing lyrics to the songs (even to the covers of \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" and \"Pinball Wizard\"), with illustrations or performance photos for each song.\n\nIn 1992, a new version was released worldwide. Elton John had moved to Polygram Records, who got the rights to all of his DJM recordings (pre-1976). MCA now controlled his post-DJM recordings, including his later work on Geffen Records which had been taken over by MCA. Geffen's \"Greatest Hits Volume III\" was deleted and replaced with \"Greatest Hits 1976–1986\", which also contained \"Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word\" and \"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\" from the original version of \"Greatest Hits – Volume 2\". On the new edition, those two songs were replaced with two singles not on the original version, 1971's \"Tiny Dancer\" and 1975's \"I Feel Like a Bullet (In the Gun of Robert Ford)\". Meanwhile, since the current edition of \"Greatest Hits Volume One\" now included \"Bennie and the Jets\" worldwide, Volume 2 now included \"Levon\" worldwide.\n\nIn the US, it was certified gold in September 1977, platinum in November 1977, 3× platinum in March 1993, 4× platinum in September 1995, and 5× platinum in August 1998 by the RIAA.\n\nAll of these versions contain \"The Bitch Is Back\", \"Someone Saved My Life Tonight\", \"Philadelphia Freedom\", \"Island Girl\", \"Grow Some Funk of Your Own\" and John's covers of \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" and \"Pinball Wizard\".\n\nReviewing in \"\" (1981), Robert Christgau wrote:\n"}

The album is credited as having songs with funk and soul material. Edward Holland, Jr., Brian Holland, Hal Davis, Freddie Perren, and Sam Brown III served as producers to \"Forever, Michael\". It is the final album before Jackson's solo breakthrough with his next album, \"Off the Wall\" (1979). \n\nExcept for the peak position of number 101 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and number 10 on the \"Billboard\" Top R&B Albums, \"Forever, Michael\" failed to chart in other countries. Unlike Jackson's previous studio albums, the album was not commercially successful worldwide. \"Forever, Michael\" was generally well received by contemporary music critics. As part of promotion for the album, three singles were released from \"Forever, Michael\", all of which were moderate commercial successes on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and other music charts worldwide. \n\nIn 1981, Motown released \"One Day in Your Life\" as a single, coupled with the compilation album of the same name. The single went to number one in the UK, becoming the 6th best-selling single of 1981 in the country. \"Forever, Michael\" has sold over one million copies worldwide. Songs from the album were reissued in 2009 after Jackson's death in June of the same year as part of the 3-disc compilation album entitled, \"\".\n\nThe album was Jackson's fourth as a solo artist and would end up being his final album released with Motown before he and his brothers, the Jackson 5 (save for Jermaine, who would remain with Motown until 1983) left for CBS Records after the release of their tenth album, \"Moving Violation\". This album displayed a change in musical style for the 16-year-old, who adopted a smoother soul sound that he would continue to develop on his later solo albums for Epic Records, the label he would record on for the rest of his life. The album is also credited as having songs with funk elements. \n\nMost of the tracks were recorded in 1974, and the album was originally set to be released that year. But because of demand from the Jackson 5's huge hit \"Dancing Machine\", production on Jackson's album was delayed until the hype from that song died down.\n\nThe album helped return Jackson to the top 40, aided by the singles \"We're Almost There\" and \"Just a Little Bit of You\", both written by the Holland Brothers (Eddie and Brian) of Holland–Dozier–Holland.\n\nIn 1981, Motown released \"One Day in Your Life\" as a single, coupled with the compilation album of the same name, to capitalize off the success of Jackson's \"Off the Wall\" on Epic. The single went to number one in the UK, becoming the 6th best-selling single of 1981 in that country.\n\nThis is the only Jackson studio album that doesn't share a name with one of the songs on the album (not counting the posthumous 2010 album \"Michael\".)\n\nAlthough his voice was already showing signs of changing on his previous album \"Music & Me\" two years earlier, this was also the first album to feature Jackson as a tenor rather than a boy soprano.\n\nThe compact disc version of the album removes the white border around the photograph of Jackson from the album cover, and instead makes the image larger so that the background cannot be seen. Furthermore, the \"Forever, Michael\" text is changed to more simple text which lists both \"Michael Jackson\" and \"Forever, Michael\" in a different font.\n\nAdapted from AllMusic.\n"}

Other banners under Dillon Stores Division include Gerbes in Missouri, Baker's in Omaha, Nebraska, and a Food 4 Less store in Fremont, Nebraska. Dillons operates grocery stores throughout Kansas with major influences in and around Wichita, Topeka and Lawrence.\n\nDillons operates a dry grocery warehouse in Goddard, near Wichita, in addition to frozen foods and perishable warehouses in Hutchinson. A bakery manufacturing plant and dairy are also in Hutchinson. The dairy produces cultured dairy products and private-label milk for all Dillons stores. Dillons previously operated (until the late 1990s) dry grocery warehouses in Hutchinson and Lenexa, Kansas.\n\nIn the 1890s, John S. Dillon opened a general store in Sterling, Kansas, and learned that allowing customers to charge then pay later and delivering groceries to their homes was a financial and manpower strain on his business. In 1913, he opened his \"J.S. Dillon Cash Store\" in Hutchinson, Kansas employed a new marketing concept called cash and carry, where the store would not offer credit or delivery services. Dillon opened a second store in 1915 that he managed then placed his son, Ray E. Dillon, in charge of the original store. In 1917, the company was incorporated under the name \"Dillon Mercantile Company, Inc\". Due to his sons John and Ray both being overseas in France during World War I, Dillon sold his company to his investment partners, but soon afterward both sons returned. They opened a new store called \"J.S. Dillon and Sons Store\" in 1919 and incorporated in 1921.\n\nAfter several decades of steadily building the chain, a burst of growth began in 1957, when John's son, Raymond, expanded with additional stores in the Wichita market when, in September 1957, Kroger sold off its Wichita, Kansas, store division, then consisting of 16 stores. By 1968, J.S. Dillon and Sons had grown into Dillon Companies, Inc., and began acquiring regional banners, such as City Market, Fry's, Gerbes, and King Soopers, over 300 convenience stores in five states, and Jackson's Ice Cream dairy. Dillon Companies, Inc., joined the Kroger company in 1983 and brought with it two future CEOs: Joe Pichler, who served as CEO of Kroger from 1990 to 2003, and Kroger's former CEO, Dave Dillon. Dave is the great grandson of J. S. Dillon.\n\nToday, more than 12,000 employees work at 93 stores in the Dillon Stores Division, which includes 26 stores in Wichita, Kansas, area; 11 stores in the Omaha, Nebraska, area; nine stores in Topeka, Kansas; and 24 fuel centers. The format for most locations is the traditional combination of food, general merchandise, and pharmacy, with an average of 49,000 square feet per store. The division offers Dillons Marketplace stores in Kansas, located in Wichita, Andover, Derby, and Hutchinson.\n\nIn 1983, Dillon Companies, Inc., was acquired by The Kroger Company of Cincinnati, Ohio, creating a nationwide grocery chain. Several years later, David Dillon was named Kroger's President and COO and became CEO in 2003. Dillon retired from that position effective January 1, 2014.\n\nIn 2006, Kroger opened the first Dillons Marketplace in Wichita, Kansas. The concept, similar to Kroger's Fred Meyer chain, is of grocery and general merchandise.\n\nIn 2013, Dillons opened its fifth Marketplace in its hometown of Hutchinson, at corner of 30th and Waldron Avenue; it is the largest store in the company.\n\nFrank J. Gerbes founded Gerbes Super Markets, Inc. in Tipton, Missouri in 1933. In the following years, he would build multiple buildings which housed its stores and offices. In 1959, a profit sharing and pension trust plan was introduced to all employees by Mr. and Mrs. Gerbes, which was the first in central Missouri.\n\nIn 1966, Gerbes merged with the Dillon Companies, and has been a division ever since. Gerbes currently has six stores in central Missouri, in the Columbia and Jefferson City area.\n"}

The film stars Charlie Sheen, Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton and Joanne Whalley-Kilmer.\n\nThe , an aircraft carrier on station in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, receives a mayday from a cargo ship. The ship reports that they have been attacked, are on fire and adrift. A deployed Navy SH-3 helicopter attempts to rescue the crew, but is downed by a gunboat and the aircrew is captured.\n\nMeanwhile, United States Navy SEALs Dale Hawkins (Charlie Sheen), James Curran (Michael Biehn), William \"Billy\" Graham (Dennis Haysbert), James Leary (Rick Rossovich), Homer Rexer (Cyril O'Reilly), Floyd \"God\" Dane (Bill Paxton), and Ramos (Paul Sanchez) are recovering from a bachelor party. Graham is to be married, but the wedding is canceled at the last minute when the whole team is paged to rescue the captured aircrew.\n\nIn the Mediterranean, the leader of the terrorists that shot at the Navy helicopter, Ben Shaheed, (Nicholas Kadi), orders the killing of the hostages. One crewmember is killed on the spot and another is beaten up, but the SEAL team arrives just in time to prevent any further murders. Responding to a suspicious noise, Hawkins breaks silence when he encounters Shaheed in an adjoining room, inadvertently alerting the terrorists. \n\nShaheed claims to be an Egyptian sailor also being held by the terrorists, and is left by the SEALs. As the SEALs evacuate the hostages from the area, Hawkins and Graham stumble across a warehouse containing Stinger missiles. Hawkins attempts to return to the warehouse to destroy the missiles, only to be ordered by Curran to proceed with extraction.\n\nOn board an aircraft carrier later that night, the individual team members are debriefed by Naval Intelligence. Curran's decision to leave the Stinger missiles behind is questioned, but Curran retorts that his primary mission was to rescue the aircrew and that Naval Intelligence did not do their job properly. Meanwhile, Hawkins is highly agitated by the mission and has trouble dealing with the emotional upheaval the mission provided. Curran tries to calm him down but is rebuffed by Hawkins.\n\nAt the Pentagon, Shaheed is seen in a video interview. The Joint Chiefs of Staff identify Shaheed and his organization, Al Shudadah. They also identify the interviewer as Claire Varrens (Joanne Whalley-Kilmer), a journalist and author who is half Lebanese. Her questioning of Shaheed yields an admission that he and his group participated in the bombing of the Marine barracks in Lebanon in 1983. Shaheed admits the complicity freely, saying they only sought revenge for the bombing of their homes by Navy ships and warplanes. \n\nThe Joint Chiefs are briefed on the recent mission and Curran requests permission to destroy the Stingers, but Navy Intelligence has learned they have already been relocated. The SEALs are ordered on R&R and enjoy a game of golf. Curran, brooding over the previous mission, reads a book authored by Varrens. During the golf outing, Graham convinces his fiancée (S. Epatha Merkerson) to try to finish the wedding, regardless of the hazards of Graham's job.\n\nThe team receives their orders for the next mission. Naval Intelligence has heard that the Stinger missiles are on board a merchant ship, the \"Latanya\", off the coast of Syria. The SEALs deploy from a submerged submarine, the USS \"Nyack\", and successfully board the ship, neutralizing two disguised gunmen, only to find out from an EOD team that the missiles are not on board after all.\n\nFrustrated by the recent unreliable intelligence, Curran solicits Varrens's cooperation. Curran takes Claire on a tour of a SEAL training facility and attempts to woo her over an elegant dinner. Claire is initially wary but opens up to Curran after learning that a Stinger has been used to shoot down a peace delegation in Lebanon. Claire provides pictures of men she has encountered who may possibly provide information that may lead the SEALs to the location of the missiles. \n\nWhile trying to identify possible contacts, Claire tells Curran and Hawkins that one of her contacts is missing, most likely having been kidnapped by the Israelis. Inspired by this, and an outburst by Hawkins, Curran presents the idea of kidnapping a potential informant to his superiors who subsequently recommend the proposal at a National Security Council meeting. A CIA executive at the meeting identifies one of the targets as a known CIA informant who could be co-opted if taken into custody. On that basis, the SEALs are authorized to bring him in.\n\nThe SEALs infiltrate the area by performing a HALO jump and swimming to shore. Curran leads several of the team inside a house to secure the informant while Hawkins, Ramos, and Graham remain outside. When Ramos is pinned down by patrolling militia, Hawkins disobeys Curran's order to stay quiet and instigates a firefight. Although Hawkins finally succeeds in killing the militiamen, Graham is killed during the firefight.\n\nCurran informs Graham's fiancée of his death, and a funeral with full military honors is held. After the wake, the men drown their sorrows at a local bar. Hawkins gives a toast to Graham for being the best friend a guy could have. Curran scolds Hawkins for his carelessness that caused Graham's death. Later, Claire arrives at Curran's houseboat to find a still grieving Curran, leading to a night of intimacy. Curran quietly leaves the next morning with Claire in bed.\n\nThe SEALs are deployed to Beirut, this time to meet a local resistance fighter from the AMAL militia who will guide them to the building containing the Stingers. Although Dane is killed while attempting to set up a sniping overwatch position, the SEALs locate the Stingers in an old school building in a heavily-bombed area of the city. Curran leads Leary and Rexer inside the building to destroy the missiles while Hawkins and Ramos maintain overwatch outside. Hawkins shoots a local gunman questioning him, alerting the terrorists. \n\nLeaving the building, Curran gets shot in the abdomen and thigh. Curran is pinned down near the building door and orders Hawkins to destroy the building regardless of Curran's being in the blast radius. Hawkins disobeys the order and rescues Curran while the other SEALs provide suppressing fire before the building is finally destroyed. \n\nThe SEALs commandeer a car and attempt to exfiltrate from the city while evading pursuit by an enemy BTR-152 Armoured Personnel Carrier (APC) armed with a twin Browning M1919A4 .30 Cal machine gun mount. The car is eventually hit by machine gunfire and Rexer killed by a stray bullet to the head. Leary, using a recovered Stinger missile launcher, manages to destroy the APC, and the four remaining SEALs escape to the beach.\n\nShaheed steals a boat from a pier-side fisherman and follows the SEALs across the water. He spots Curran's body floating in the sea. As he attempts to pull the body from the water he is attacked by the SEALs and, in an underwater fight, Hawkins kills Shaheed. The other SEALs take out the remaining topside terrorists and destroy the small boat. With the mission finally accomplished, the designated exfiltration submarine surfaces, recovering the SEALs.\n\n\nThe movie received negative reviews from critics. At the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 19% \"Rotten\" rating, based on 31 critics' reviews, which are summarized thus: \"a non-winning military recruitment propaganda movie that happens to star Charlie Sheen and Michael Biehn.\" The film received 3 out of 4 stars on UK Virgin Television.\n\nThe movie was not a box office success, debuting at No. 4 and eventually grossing $25 million domestically, just barely above its reported budget of $21 million.\n\nThe film was more successful on home video with a VHS released on January 31, 1991. A Blu-ray was released in 2009 in United States.\n\n\n"}

A survey of Western philosophy from the pre-Socratic philosophers to the early 20th century, it was criticised for Russell's over-generalization and omissions, particularly from the post-Cartesian period, but nevertheless became a popular and commercial success, and has remained in print from its first publication. When Russell was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1950, \"A History of Western Philosophy\" was cited as one of the books that won him the award. Its success provided Russell with financial security for the last part of his life.\n\nThe book was written during the Second World War, having its origins in a series of lectures on the history of philosophy that Russell gave at the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia during 1941 and 1942.\nMuch of the historical research was done by Russell's third wife Patricia. In 1943, Russell received an advance of $3000 from the publishers, and between 1943 and 1944 he wrote the book while living at Bryn Mawr College. The book was published in 1945 in the United States and a year later in the UK. It was re-set as a 'new edition' in 1961, but no new material was added. Corrections and minor revisions were made to printings of the British first edition and for 1961's new edition; no corrections seem to have been transferred to the American edition (even Spinoza's birth year remains wrong).\n\nThe work is divided into three books, each of which is subdivided into chapters; each chapter generally deals with a single philosopher, school of philosophy, or period of time.\n\n\n\n\n\"A History of Western Philosophy\" received a mixed reception, especially from academic reviewers. Russell was somewhat dismayed at the reaction. Russell himself described the text as a work of social history, asking that it be treated in such a manner. Russell also stated: \"I regarded the early part of my \"History of Western Philosophy\" as a history of culture, but in the later parts, where science becomes important, it is more difficult to fit into this framework. I did my best, but I am not at all sure that I succeeded. I was sometimes accused by reviewers of writing not a true history but a biased account of the events that I arbitrarily chose to write of. But to my mind, a man without bias cannot write interesting history — if, indeed, such a man exists.\"\n\nIn the \"Journal of the History of Ideas\", the philosopher George Boas wrote that, \"\"A History of Western Philosophy\" errs consistently in this respect. Its author never seems to be able to make up his mind whether he is writing history or polemic... [Its method] confers on philosophers who are dead and gone a kind of false contemporaneity which may make them seem important to the uninitiate. But nevertheless it is a misreading of history.\" In \"Isis\", Leo Roberts wrote that while Russell was a deft and witty writer, \"A History of Western Philosophy\" was perhaps the worst of Russell's books. In his view, Russell was at his best when dealing with contemporary philosophy, and that in contrast \"his treatment of ancient and medieval doctrines is nearly worthless.\" \"A History of Western Philosophy\" was praised by physicists Albert Einstein and Erwin Schrödinger.\n\nThe philosopher Frederick Copleston, writing in \"A History of Philosophy\", described Russell's book as \"unusually lively and entertaining\", but added that Russell's \"treatment of a number of important philosophers is both inadequate and misleading.\" He credited Russell with drawing attention to the logical side of Leibniz's philosophy, but questioned Russell's view that there is a sharp distinction between Leibniz's \"popular philosophy\" and his \"esoteric doctrine\". The critic George Steiner, writing in \"Heidegger\", described \"A History of Western Philosophy\" as \"vulgar\", noting that Russell omits any mention of Martin Heidegger. In Jon Stewart's anthology \"The Hegel Myths and Legends\" (1996), Russell's work is listed as a book that has propagated \"myths\" about Hegel. Stephen Houlgate writes that Russell's claim that Hegel's doctrine of the state justifies any form of tyranny is ignorant. The philosopher Roger Scruton, writing in \"A Short History of Modern Philosophy\", described \"A History of Western Philosophy\" as elegantly written and witty, but faulted it for Russell's concentration on pre-Cartesian philosophy, lack of understanding of Immanuel Kant, and over-generalization and omissions. The philosopher A. C. Grayling writes of the work that, \"Parts of this famous book are sketchy ... in other respects it is a marvelously readable, magnificently sweeping survey of Western thought, distinctive for placing it informatively into its historical context. Russell enjoyed writing it, and the enjoyment shows; his later remarks about it equally show that he was conscious of its shortcomings.\"\n\n\nCitations\nSources\n\n"}

The team was based in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada.\n\nThe St. Catharines Teepees were born in 1947 when local businessman George Stauffer, president and GM of Thompson Products Ltd., purchased the St. Catharines Falcons team for $2500 from Rudy Pilous and named the team after the company's initials.\n\nDuring the fifteen years the Teepees played, they developed into a powerhouse in the OHA. St. Catharines finished in first place five years in a six-year span, and won the league championship twice. The team also produced five league leading scorers and three MVPs in the same period. The Teepees won the Memorial Cup in both 1954 and 1960.\n\nIn 1961-62 the Teepees, no longer owned by Thompson Products, were in financial trouble and the Chicago Black Hawks came to their rescue. In 1962-63, the Teepees became the St. Catharines Black Hawks and would remain so until the team moved to Niagara Falls for the 1976-77 season.\n\nSt. Catharines, still coached by Rudy Pilous, won the right to play for the Cup by defeating the Toronto Marlboros in seven games for the OHA championship, and the Quebec Frontenacs to win the Richardson Trophy as eastern Canadian representatives. The Teepees won the Memorial Cup in 1954 played at Maple Leaf Gardens. They defeated the Edmonton Oil Kings 4 games to 0 with one tie game, in a best-of-seven series.\n\nSt. Catharines was now coached by Max Kaminsky and Rudy Pilous was the team manager for the 1960 Memorial Cup rematch versus the Edmonton Oil Kings. On the road to the Cup, the Teepees defeated the Toronto St. Michael's Majors for the OHA championship, and the Brockville Canadiens to win the Richardson Trophy as eastern Canadian representatives. The series against Brockville was decided in the 8th game after each team had won three games each with a tie game.\n\nThe 1960 Memorial Cup opened up at the Garden City Arena with remaining games played at Maple Leaf Gardens. The Teepees defeated the Edmonton Oil Kings for the second time in the Memorial Cup, 4 games to 2 in a best-of-seven series.\n\nThe St. Catharines Teepees are one of a few clubs to win multiple Memorial Cup championships. In total the Teepees won the Memorial Cup, the George Richardson Memorial Trophy, the J. Ross Robertson Cup and the Hamilton Spectator Trophy twice each.\nThere have been 54 Teepees alumni play in the NHL. Four of those would be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. St. Catharines also had three MVPs and five scoring champions with a six-year span.\n\nRudy Pilous\n\n\n\nThe St. Catharines Teepees played in the Garden City Arena in downtown St. Catharines, Ontario from 1947-1962, as did their predecessors the Falcons.\n"}

The flight zone is determined by the animal's flight distance, sometimes called flight initiation distance (FID) which extends horizontally from the animal and sometimes vertically. It may also be termed escape distance, alert distance, flush distance, and escape flight distance.\n\nSwiss zoologist Heini Hediger distinguished between \"flight distance\" (run boundary), \"critical distance\" (attack boundary), \"personal distance\" (distance separating members of non-contact species, as a pair of swans), and \"social distance\" (intraspecies communication distance).\n\nFlight distance can be used as a measure of the willingness of an animal to take risks. Escape theory predicts that the probability of fleeing and flight distance increase as predation risk increases and decrease as escape cost increases. Flight initiation distance is one measure of animals' fear responses to humans.\n\nIn a study comparing 56 bird species with long flight distances, it was found these had declining populations in Europe. This indicates that standardized measures of flight distance can provide reliable information about the population consequences of risk-taking behaviour by individuals and the susceptibility of different species to increased levels of disturbance by humans. A further study analyzing 75 flight initiation distance studies of 212 species found that larger species are more tolerant of humans.\n\nWhen the flight zone of a group of bulls was invaded by a mechanical trolley, the bulls moved away and maintained a constant distance between themselves and the trolley. This indicates animals sometimes maintain a flight zone around inanimate objects.\n\nThe flight initiation distance is being used as a tool in wildlife management. By studying flight zones, wildlife managers are able to reduce the impact of humans by creating buffer zones between human populations and animal habitats.\n\nThe alert distance (AD) is the distance, by definition greater, within which the animal changes its behaviour in a manner enabling it to better observe the stimulus, as by raising the head in an alert posture, but does not necessarily flee unless the stimulus is also within the escape distance. These measures are usually used to quantify the tolerance of wildlife to humans.\n\nAnimals faced with approaching predators must decide at which distance to initiate their flight, and they are expected to do so in a way that maximizes their fitness. As flight has both costs (including lost opportunity) and benefits, there will be in general an optimal flight initiation distance, defined as the first point in a predator's approach at which the benefit of flight exceeds the cost. The benefit of\nflight is equivalent to the cost of remaining in place or, in other words, to the risk of capture. The size of the flight zone can therefore vary according to circumstances. However, it has been shown in burrowing owls that individuals showed high repeatability in their FID.\n\n\nWildlife managers often use ED and FID to develop set-back distances to reduce human impacts on wildlife, both in wildlife refuges, and, e.g., in planning areas for outdoor recreation.\n\nThese measures are also important in birding and nature photography.\n\nThe FID in multiple species differs from rural to urban areas. A study by Møller et al. examined 811 FIDs from 37 species of birds and determined that the FID of birds in urban areas is reduced, compared to the FID of birds in rural areas. Urbanization of birds has also been shown to correlate with changes in stress physiology and anti predator behaviour. This may be due to a number of factors differing in rural vs urban areas, such as; difference in predator communities, length of exposure time to humans, relative abundance of humans, and the presence/abundance of food (bird-feeders in winter for example). Wildlife managers must adjust buffer zones depending on urban/rural environments.\n\nSome physical characteristics are very important to determine an animal's FID. Eye size and brain size have a role in determining the FID. FID in 107 species of birds was studied in relation to eye size and brain size and was shown that FID increases with larger eyes and decreases with larger brains. Larger eyes mean that predators can be detected from further away and thus the FID would be larger compared to smaller eyes. Larger brains decrease the FID compared to smaller brains, since they can better process the intent of predators and can delay their flight response for as long as possible.\n\nFID can be highly variable, but it can also be viewed as a species-specific trait. A study conducted using eight species of shorebirds at six different sites in Australia was conducted to determine if FID was species specific. It was demonstrated that while both the species and the site influenced the FID, there was no significant interaction between them. This indicates that FID is species-specific, and while sites do influence the FID of a species, the average FID is a good reference for wildlife managers to use when creating buffer zones.\n\nWhile escape distance has been generally used as a measure of tolerance, other changes in animal behavior in presence of humans, such as increased vigilance time at the cost of decreased feeding time, may have significant overall impact on wildlife. Therefore, it is suggested that a more conservative measure, namely, the alert distance, should be used in determining minimum approaching distance. The latter typically adds a certain buffer distance to the given tolerance measure.\n\nThe flight zone is an important principle for herding, working, and mustering livestock. An animal can be stimulated to move simply by skirting its flight zone, and the animal will move in the desired direction according to the point of balance. The point of balance is usually located at the animals shoulder according to their wide angled vision. An over-stimulated animal will have a larger flight zone, for example an excited or scared animal. A Cumulative Flight Zone is formed when animals move in a herd. In this situation the lead animal and the following animals Points of Balance, within the cumulative flight zone, must both be crossed to entice movement.\n\nThe flight distance during handling is usually 1.5 to 7.6 m for beef cattle raised in a feeding operation and up to 30 m on mountain ranges. Brahman cattle have a larger flight zone than most English breeds. The flight zone can be thought of as the animals personal space. The size of the flight zone is determined by the tameness of the animal; the more domesticated an animal, the smaller the zone. Fully tame animals have no flight zone.\n\nThe flight zones in cattle vary depending on the situation they are experiencing. Novel situations increase their flight zone, while accustomed stimuli will decrease their flight zone. The flight zone is larger in the front than behind, due to the majority of their senses pointing forward. As the animal becomes more relaxed in a situation or with a person its flight zone will reduce. The cow's prior experiences with humans has also been shown to affect their flight zone. Cow's with positive handling experiences were shown to have smaller flight zones than those with negative handling experiences.\nStudies with sheep indicated that animals confined in a narrow alley had a smaller flight zone compared to animals confined in a wider alley.\n\nHandlers sometimes make the mistake of deeply invading the flight zone when animals are being driven down an alley or into an enclosed area such as a crowd pen. If the handler deeply penetrates the flight zone, the animals may turn back and run over them in an attempt to escape. Confining a livestock animal in a crush (chute) or alley can make it feel more secure and thus reduce the size of the flight zone; however, it does not eliminate the flight zone. An animal in a livestock raceway or alley that feels threatened may panic and injure itself or other animals. If handlers lean over fences around animals they penetrate the \"zone of safety\" and may cause the animals to rear.\n\nAnimals have a tendency to move in the opposite direction when their handler walks deep into their flight zone. By crossing an animal's point of balance, within the flight zone, a handler can move the herd in a particular direction and control their speed of movement. For example, crossing the point of balance from front to back will move the animal forwards, while the opposite is also true. The handler's pace should always reflect the animal's speed when herding. Additionally, pressure should be alternated on the flight zone to reduce stress. Constant pressure should never be applied.\n\nIf animals turn to face the handler he or she is considered to be no longer penetrating the flight zone.\n\nIt is important that a handler does not pursue any struggling animals as this will cause undue stress. Instead the animal should be allowed to return to the group as animals naturally have herd instincts, and will follow the group's leader. A good herding practice applying this is the movement of animals through a race by maintaining a steady flow of animals, not herding in groups, this allows new animals to follow the leader calmly. When yarded, animals should always have room to turn away from the handler to reduce stress. Minimal stress prevents injury to the animal and maintains good production, such as increased quality of meat and improved muscle and fat scores.\n\nAppropriate frequent penetration of the flight zone can train the animals to minimise their flight zone to the handler.\n\nPoor husbandry skills including over penetration of the flight zone results in the following behaviours: stress, panic, aggression, bolting, prey behaviour, charging, fainting, sickness and self-inflicted damage. Rough handling, such as constant flight zone pressure, can raise the heart rate of an animal. These factors are all reflective of the General Adaptation Syndrome.\n\nThe general adaptation syndrome (GAS) is a three-phase response to stress in animals. \n\nSample escape distances (mostly mean) from humans:\n\nBirds of Europe\n\nBirds of North America \n\nMammals of North America \n\nEscape distance may differ significantly depending on many circumstances. Body size is the best known general factor influencing interspecies differences. Very frequently large species are more timid than small species, because size affects how rapidly a bird can take off. Surprisingly, an analysis of hundreds of studies found that larger birds are \"more\" tolerant of humans, despite substantial research that shows larger animals are \"less\" tolerant of humans.\n\nAmong the affecting factors:\n\n"}

{"id": "2110996", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2110996", "title": "Civil Rights Congress", "text": "Civil Rights Congress\n\nThe Civil Rights Congress (CRC) was a United States civil rights organization, formed in 1946 at a national conference for radicals and disbanded in 1956. It succeeded the International Labor Defense, the National Federation for Constitutional Liberties, and the National Negro Congress, serving as a defense organization. Beginning about 1948, it became involved in representing African Americans sentenced to death and other highly prominent cases, in part to highlight racial injustice in the United States. After Rosa Lee Ingram and her two teenage sons were sentenced in Georgia, the CRC conducted a national appeals campaign on their behalf, their first for African Americans.\n\nThe CRC coordinated nationally, with 60 chapters at its peak in 1950. These acted on local issues. Most were located on the East and West coasts, with only about 10 chapters in the states of the former Confederacy, five of them in Texas.\n\nThe CRC used a two-pronged strategy of litigation and demonstrations, with extensive public communications, to call attention to racial injustice in the United States. A major tactic was publicizing cases, especially in the South, such as those of Rosa Lee Ingram and her two sons in Georgia, the Martinsville Seven in Virginia, and Willie McGee in Mississippi, in which Black people had been sentenced to death; in the last two cases as a result of questionable rape charges. Given the disenfranchisement of blacks in the South at the turn of the century, all-white juries were standard, as only voters could serve.\n\nThe CRC succeeded particularly in raising international awareness about these cases, which sometimes generated protests to the president and Congress. They also represented defendants in legal appeals to overturn convictions or gain lesser sentences. At that time in the South, when cases were tried by all-white juries, some of the defense team believed that gaining a life sentence instead of capital punishment was akin to acquittal, where social pressure was high for juries to find blacks guilty. The CRC also defended political dissidents, including Communists. The group conducted high-profile protests in Washington, D.C., and at the United Nations. It brought world attention to racism in the United States by presenting the U.N. with a petition titled \"We Charge Genocide,\" detailing the abuses of African Americans in the US, including continuing lynchings in the 1940s.\n\nThe CRC was perceived as an alternative or competitor to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) because it worked on similar issues in representing African Americans in legal cases and suits. The CRC believed that it embraced a wider range of issues and a larger coalition. It became involved in the defense of Rosa Lee Ingram and her sons, and Willie McGee.\n\nIn 1950, while the NAACP was working on appeals of the Martinsville Seven, who had all been convicted and sentenced to death in speedy trials, the parents of one defendant, DeSales Grayson, appealed separately to the CRC to defend their son. The NAACP contended that the organizations had different approaches; it spent more of its funds on direct defense of clients, including appeals, whereas the CRC mounted a public campaign, complete with distribution of pamphlets and advertising on billboards.\n\nBecause the CRC had attracted adverse attention from the government, with the potential to negatively affect reception of appeals in the Martinsville Seven case, the CRC withdrew from direct defense of Grayson in July 1950. But, the NAACP was unable to succeed with its appeals. All seven of the men were executed in February 1951.\n\nDuring the years of the Red Scare, due to its Communist Party affiliations, the CRC was classified as subversive and described as a communist front organization by US Attorney General Thomas Clark under President Harry S. Truman, as well as by the House Committee on Un-American Activities. Targeted by the U.S. government, the group was weakened in 1951, and it finally disbanded in 1956.\n\nThe group was formed at a radical conference in Detroit held on April 27–28, 1946. Early goals included abolition of HUAC and protecting southern workers' right to unionize. In December 1947, the National Negro Congress merged into the group. International Labor Defense (ILD) national secretary William Patterson led the group throughout its existence. Frank Marshall Davis served on the organization's National Executive Board. Patterson also headed the Abraham Lincoln School in Chicago, with Davis also on the faculty and Board of Directors.\n\nThe group gained about 10,000 members at its peak. It was generally stronger on the coasts and weak in the South, but it did conduct several major campaigns to defend the legal rights of Southern Blacks. Its largest and strongest chapters in the South were in New Orleans and Miami. Altogether, the CRC founded more than 60 local chapters which sought to combat racial discrimination, racist stereotyping, and legal injustice in their communities.\n\nThe U.S. Congress and courts weakened the group with legal restrictions in 1951. In 1956, members voted to disband.\n\nThe CRC took up legal causes of those they considered unjustly accused. In addition to pursuing legal campaigns, often alongside the NAACP, the group sought to raise awareness outside the courtroom with demonstrations, propaganda, and high-profile events. As these campaigns gained popular awareness, the CRC received many letters from prisoners requesting legal assistance.\n\nThe CRC opposed the 1940 Smith Act and 1950 McCarran Act, both of which expanded government powers to prosecute domestic dissent. It generally came to the assistance of individuals targeted by HUAC, particularly the \"Top Eleven\" communist leaders tried in 1949 under the Smith Act.\n\nThe CRC was also active in the defense of Harry Bridges, a union organizer and leader of the California chapter of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union. The government had long sought his deportation, and Congress passed the Smith Act to provide a means to accomplish this. After Bridges became a naturalized US citizen in 1945, the government prosecuted him for perjury for having failed to acknowledge being a member of the Communist Party in his naturalization application. The conviction was overturned due to a statute of limitations in the law.\n\nThe CRC campaigned for Rosa Lee Ingram and her two teenage sons (Wallace and Sammie Lee Ingram) against a death penalty murder charge in Georgia, the first African Americans for whom they campaigned on a national level for an appeal. The Ingrams, who were sharecroppers, were accused of murdering their white neighbor, John Ethron Stratford, in 1947 over an argument about animals on his land and his sexual harassment of the mother, Rosa Lee. They had been convicted—on the basis of circumstantial testimony, with no eyewitnesses—by a jury of twelve white men after a one-day trial in January 1948. The Ingrams had no access to lawyers before the trial.\n\nThe Ingram appeal campaign was orchestrated by the Women's Committee for Equal Justice, a CRC subdivision led by the nationally known leader, Mary Church Terrell. As its predecessor, the ILD, had accomplished with the Scottsboro case, the CRC hoped to use the Ingram case to draw national and international attention to racial inequality in the United States. Pressure from the CRC and the NAACP led to a new hearing in March 1948. In this hearing, the judge denied requests for a new trial, but used his discretion to reduce the sentence from death to life in prison.\n\nThe NAACP and CRC came into occasional conflict over the case because of differing goals and strategy. By the wishes of the Ingrams, the NAACP generally handled the legal side; the CRC worked mostly on publicity. It raised $45,125 for the Ingram Defense Fund and held annual Mother's Day rallies. On 21 September 1949, Terrell led a group to the United Nations to demand that officials address the Ingram case. Little progress was made in the case, but both the NAACP and the CRC continued to support Ingram during her imprisonment. Ingram and her sons were all released on parole in 1959, cited as \"model prisoners.\"\n\nAs in the Ingram case, both the NAACP and the CRC rallied to the cause of the Martinsville Seven— seven black men all sentenced to death in Virginia in 1949 for the rape of a white woman. Only black men received the death sentence in Virginia in rape cases. Martin A. Martin, the chief lawyer hired by the NAACP from a major Richmond law firm, refused to work with the CRC because the government had classified the group as subversive and as a Communist front.\n\nAgain excluded from the legal process, the CRC launched a national campaign based on injustices in the cases of Martinsville Seven and Willie McGee in Mississippi. McGee was also sentenced to death for conviction of rape of a white woman. The CRC created national attention and coordinated mailing campaigns to the government in Washington, DC, but the appeals failed. The US Supreme Court refused to hear the Martinsville Seven case, and all the men were executed in February 1951. McGee was executed in May 1951.\n\nIn this period, the CRC was defending Communist officials known as the Top Eleven against prosecution under the Smith Act. This drew attention to their communist affiliation and people worried that the CRC endangered the outcome of the appeals for that reason. It withdrew from representing one of the Martinsville Seven directly.\n\nThe CRC took stances on many issues related to political freedom and the rights of African Americans. It supported anti-lynching laws, and condemned the use of the Confederate flag at many government and school facilities in the South.\n\nIt opposed U.S. intervention in the Korean War. The CRC opposed the Taft-Hartley Act and offered assistance to the Congress of Industrial Organizations and to the American Federation of Labor.\n\nIn Louisiana, a local chapter launched a major campaign to convict the white police officer who shot Roy Cyril Brooks. The Brooks case began a larger effort against police brutality and demands to hire more Black police officers in cities such as New Orleans.\n\nIn January 1949, the group held a \"Freedom Crusade\" in Washington, D.C., right before the re-inauguration of President Truman. Before the demonstration, the group had a public exchange with Congressperson John S. Wood. Wood accused the group of threatening \"violence and riot\" in the capital; the group responded that the white supremacy of the status quo \"is constantly the scene of 'violence and riot' against Negro citizens.\" The Freedom Crusade was ultimately an orderly demonstration in which several thousand people visited elected politicians to demand action against lynching, freedom for communist leaders imprisoned for subversion (known as the Top Eleven), and implementation of the Fair Employment Practices Commission.\n\nIn 1951, the Civil Rights Congress issued its petition to the United Nations entitled \"We Charge Genocide: The Crime of Government Against the Negro People\". This document collected diverse instances of violence and mistreatment against African Americans, and argued that the United States government was a party to genocide in its own country. After William Patterson presented the document to the United Nations assembly in Paris, his passport was revoked by the State Department. Paul Robeson and W. E. B. Du Bois were blocked from traveling, and went to the U.N. offices in New York.\n\nSoon after it was founded, the CRC became a target of the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) and the Internal Revenue Service. A 1947 report to HUAC charged: \"Having adopted a line of militant skullduggery against the United States with the close of World War II, the Communist Party has set up the Civil Rights Congress for the purpose of protecting those of its members who run afoul of the law.\" The group denied these charges and provided a list of sponsors, including Representatives Adam C. Powell, Senator Glen H. Taylor, and Atlanta University President Rufus Early Clement. Patterson called the group \"non-partisan\" and described it as \"the Red Cross of the defenders of peace, constitutional rights, justice and human rights\".\n\nThe 1950 McCarran Internal Security Act increased government persecution of the group, and many of its leaders were jailed. The group's power weakened in 1951 when the federal government barred it from posting bail for communist defendants in the resulting trials. During the Second Red Scare, many Americans wary of the group because of its communist connections. In 1956, the CRC was declared a communist front by the Subversive Activities Control Board. It disbanded the same year.\n\nThe CRC was also infiltrated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. FBI agent Matthew Cvetic, who had joined the Communist Party, testified to HUAC in 1950 that the CRC was Communist-controlled and that Patterson was a Communist. He also identified a long list of politicians as Communist, as well as celebrities and community leaders. Various other agents surfaced to testify at anti-Communist trials. Association with the Civil Rights Congress served as justification for FBI surveillance of Lena Horne and Paul Robeson. One agent later described breaking into the CRC's Chicago offices, saying \"Anything that had the name 'committee' or 'congress' the FBI assumed had to be subversive.\"\n\nDavid Brown, secretary and then chair of the Los Angeles chapter of the CRC, served as an FBI informant from 1950-1954. He disappeared in January 1955 and tried to fake his own kidnapping. Soon after, he unsuccessfully attempted suicide in a hotel room. He later said he felt ashamed and suicidal for being a \"stool pigeon\". He testified that his pay varied from $25/week to $250/month, and that he routinely lied to FBI contacts.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was also introduced in China in 2008 as Dodge's second modern vehicle offering in that market. Dodge vehicles were last officially sold in China during the World War II era. The introduction of the Caliber had marked the return of the Dodge brand to Australia since the early 1970s.\n\nThe Caliber in Japan joined the Chrysler PT Cruiser in 2007, as the PT Cruiser was offered since 2000, but as with previous Chrysler products sold in Japan, the width dimension exceeded Japanese Government dimension regulations, and Japanese consumers were liable for annual taxes for driving a larger car which affected sales. As Chrysler products were considered large to the Japanese market, Chrysler offered products that offered spacious interiors with four doors and one piece liftgates to broaden their appeal to the Japanese as a compromise for paying the annual tax for large vehicles.\n\nThe marketing plan for the first year of the Caliber's production included 20% of the budget for online marketing, print ads, and TV commercials.\n\nThe Dodge Caliber offered a continuously variable transmission (called \"CVT2\" by Dodge) sourced from Jatco (a Nissan subsidiary), the second DaimlerChrysler model to employ this technology after the Mercedes-Benz A-Class. It uses a four-cylinder 1.8-2.4 L \"World\" gasoline engine, designed jointly by Chrysler, Mitsubishi, and Hyundai.\n\nThe car features an optional electronically controlled all-wheel drive system with variable torque at speeds of for optimal handling.\n\nThe Caliber uses a heavily modified GS platform, co-designed with Mitsubishi Motors. The modified GS platform is now called the JS platform by Chrysler for mid-size cars and PM/MK for compact cars. It shares a portion of the platform with the Mitsubishi Lancer, but is most similar to the Jeep Compass and Jeep Patriot. The Caliber wheels have a 5-hole pattern with a 114.3 mm bolt circle.\n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) gave the Caliber an overall \"Good\" score in frontal crash testing. The Dodge Caliber was standard with side curtain airbags, but torso side airbags were optional. The IIHS had scored the Caliber \"Marginal\" overall in their side impact test. However, that Caliber was not equipped with the optional torso side airbag.\n\nThree models were available at the Caliber's launch, with a fourth available in mid-2006.\n\nThe base SE model features front-wheel drive and a 1.8 L \"World\" I4 attached to a Magna Drivetrain T355 5-speed manual transmission. A 2.0 L version of the engine paired with the CVT2 transmission was available as an option.\n\nThe standard configuration for the SE lacks air conditioning, power windows, door locks, or mirrors. The grille surround is body-colored, while that of all other models is chromed. Canadian SXT and R/T models feature body color grilles instead of chrome grilles. The Caliber SE doesn't have a tachometer or assist handles, steel wheels with wheel covers are standard. Some options were not available on the SE.\n\nFor 2011, this model was named Express, reverting to SE for 2012. For 2012, the CVT transmission option was dropped only for the SE, leaving the five-speed manual transmission as the only available transmission option for the SE. The CVT continued to be offered in the SXT and SXT Plus models for 2012.\n\nThe SXT has the same engine choices as the SE but many more features are available as standard. Air conditioning is standard equipment at this level, including the Chill Zone beverage cooler inside the front lower glove compartment. The gauge cluster gains a tachometer and an (optional) trip computer. The driver's seat adds height adjustment, the passenger seat folds flat for load-carrying, and the rear seats recline. Power windows, locks, mirrors, and remote keyless entry are included. The grille is chromed and steel wheels are standard, with aluminum wheels as an option. The cargo area light includes a removable and rechargeable flashlight while the front dome light incorporates two reading lamps. In Europe this version was also commercialized equipped with a VW-built 2.0 liter turbodiesel engine.\n\nSome Dodge publications mention a SXT Sport Wagon model, while others (e.g. the Dodge website) list a SXT \"E\" package with identical features. This consists of aluminum wheels, color-keyed cloth seat inserts, color-matched instrument panel trim, along with fog lamps.\n\nThe UK SXT Sport model has alloy wheels, color-keyed cloth seats and instrument panel, and a 9-speaker audio system as standard; early UK models did not have the chrome grille. The UK SXT Sport was available with a Volkswagen 2.0 L diesel engine mated to a six-speed manual transmission.\n\nFor 2011, the Heat, Uptown, and Mainstreet were three available trim levels of the Caliber, reverting to SXT and SXT Plus in 2012.\n\nThe R/T model has a 2.4 L version of the World engine, equipped with the CVT2 transmission, and programmed with an 'AutoStick' feature giving six simulated fixed ratios in a clutchless manual mode in addition to the standard CVT 'Drive' mode. All-wheel-drive was an option on the R/T model until 2009, but with automatic transmission only. Eighteen-inch aluminum wheels were standard, while chromed versions were optional. At launch, the CVT2 with all-wheel drive was the only powertrain combination available for the R/T. A front-wheel drive variant with the T355 5-speed manual transmission commenced production in late summer 2006. ABS was standard, and the suspension and steering systems were tuned for performance.\n\nExternally, the R/T is distinguishable by body-color/chrome door handles (replacing black on other models), a chrome side molding, chromed exhaust tip, and front fog lights as standard, as well as R/T badging.\n\nInternally, the car came standard with color-keyed fabric seat inserts, while leather seats were an option as on the SXT. Color-keyed instrument panel trim was also standard, as well as a leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio controls and speed control, and a cargo area cover (all options on the SXT).\n\nThe R/T model was discontinued in 2010.\n\nThe SRT4 model that was introduced at the Chicago Auto Show in February 2006, was a replacement for the original Neon-based SRT-4 produced by Chrysler's Street and Racing Technology group.\n\nThe SRT4 hatchback competed with the Volkswagen GTI and the Mazdaspeed3. It featured a 2.4 L DOHC 16V turbocharged I4 with dual variable valve timing (DVVT). The engine produces at 6,400 rpm, and of torque at 5,600 rpm using the TD04HL4S-20 turbo. Edmunds.com tested a Caliber SRT4 on a chassis dynamometer and obtained and of torque at the wheels. Edmunds called the manufacturer's rating conservative; putting more power to the road than cars costing twice as much. This engine is mated to a Getrag six-speed manual transmission, and uses a front-wheel drive drivetrain. The Caliber SRT4 uses a MacPherson strut front suspension, and a multilink rear suspension. The SRT4 came with large vented front disc brakes (from the Dodge Charger Police Pack version) with dual-piston calipers and rear single-piston disc brakes. It also featured four-wheel ABS, with electronic assistance. The wheels are , five-spoke, SRT-stamped, painted aluminum and equipped with Goodyear RSA 225/45R19 tires. Package options included polished aluminum wheels, Goodyear Eagle F1 Supercar tires, SIRIUS satellite radio with Kicker SRT livin' loud audio, EVIC with performance pages, security alarm, and optional paint colors.\n\nThe SRT4 model of the Caliber was available through 2009.\n\nFor the 2009 model, the Caliber underwent a minor revamp. The plain plastic black-colored door handles available on base models were replaced by painted car-colored handles previously available only on R/T. In addition, the trunk lid was reduced in weight and simplified in opening. In the interior, all panels were made black instead of grey. The \"DODGE\" badge that was on top of the Ram logo at the middle was shifted to the left, while \"CALIBER\" badge was moved to the right from the left, both equal in font size. The car model title, previously indicated on the right, was moved to the bottom right corner of the gate lid.\n\nThe 2010 model year was unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show, featuring a refreshed interior design composed of metallic outlines and parts of glass to suppress the abundance of plastic materials on previous models, as well as the addition of an 8-way power drivers seat, heated mirrors, and an automatic climate control system previously available only on R/T. The dashboard also features the relocation of the glove box due to many customer complaints, which now occupies the spot over the radio panel and comprises a \"push-open\" lock instead of the previous \"squeeze-and-lift\" opening mechanism.\n\nThe 1.8 L engine was dropped from the SE and SXT models, and the SRT-4 model is discontinued. European market models receive a new 2.2 L diesel engine with and of torque that provides a combined city and highway fuel efficiency of .\n\nFor United States market only, the models were promptly renamed and rebranded, with SE becoming \"Main Street\", SXT — \"Heat\" and R/T — \"Rush\". Two more models were launched in 2010: a luxury all-included variant \"Uptown\" and a base variant \"Express\" in which the black plastic handles returned. \"Express\" was the only model not to feature the automatic climate control as an option, the \"Main Street\" featured speed control, anti-lock brake system and electronic stability control, which were previously unavailable as options for SE. All models except \"Express\" featured 17-inch wheels.\n\nThe 2011 model brought six new paint schemes, standard stability control except on Express models, Sirius traffic when equipped with a navigation system, 18-inch chrome-clad wheels available on Uptown models (17\" painted are standard), updated steering except on Express models, and new shocks and a thicker rear anti-roll bar on Rush and Heat models. The Caliber and the Nitro were the only two cars in the Dodge vehicle line-up to still feature the Ram logo on both fascia, rear and the steering wheel. The Dodge Nitro also featured driver and passenger's floor mats. The logo was removed from the mats in Calibers with the 2009 model.\n\nFor the 2012 model year, the models were renamed back to SE, SXT, and SXT Plus. The Plus version includes all the SXT items and 18-inch aluminum wheels with performance tires, as well as a 6-way power adjustable driver seat. The SXT Plus was not sold in Canada.\n\nThe 2010 Caliber was the last model sold in Europe. The 2011 model ended production on November 23, 2011, in United States, with the remainder being sold as the 2012 model year Caliber in both U.S. and Canada. A successor called the Dart, based on the Alfa Romeo Giulietta's platform, went on sale in June 2012 for the 2013 model-year as the compact vehicle in Dodge's lineup.\n\n\n"}

Like a number of Ukrainian writers, he flourished in 1920s Ukraine, but was finally constrained and eventually arrested by the Soviet authorities. He is considered one of the leading figures of the Executed Renaissance.\n\nPidmohylny was born in Ekaterinoslav Governorate (now Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Ukraine). His father was a manager for a large landowner. He learned French as a child and continued his efforts, eventually becoming a major translator of French literature into Ukrainian, in particular the works of Anatole France and Guy de Maupassant.\n\nHis early adult life is sketchy, but there is a slight indication that he was a supporter of Symon Petliura, the military commander of the short-lived independent Ukraine created after the Soviet Revolution.\n\nLiving in Kiev, but having difficulty publishing some of his stories in 1923, he was able to secure publication in the anti-Soviet émigré journal \"Nova Ukraina\". This created disagreements with other Ukrainian writers including Khvyl'ovyi, one of the leading writers of the period.\n\nPidmohylny published a wide number of stories in the next several years after having been \"exonerated\" by the major Ukrainian journal \"Chervonyi shliakh\". He also participated in the literary group \"Lanka\" tied to the journal \"Zhyttia i revoliutsiia\". In addition to prose fiction and translations, he also published several critical essays, and is considered one of the pioneers of Freudian criticism in Ukraine.\n\nIn 1927, at the age of 26, Pidmohylny won recognition as a major author with the publication of his novel \"Misto\" (The City), which was also translated into Russian.\n\nAs harsh Stalinism solidified in Ukraine, Pidmohylny had increasing difficulty publishing his work, especially magnified because of questions of his commitment to the Soviet system. In 1934, he was arrested. After being tortured and forced to sign absurd confessions, he was sentenced to the Solovki prison camp and shot in Sandarmokh, Karelia.\n\nAfter Stalin’s death, Pidmohylny was partially rehabilitated in 1956.\n\nThe novel \"Misto\" is the story of a young man thrust into the violent sights and smells of an urban environment and has been translated into English.\n\nThe novel \"A Little Touch of Drama\" (Ukrainian: Невеличка драма), originally only published in serialization, describes the character types of a number of men who compete for the love of one woman. One of her primary admirers is a scientist, and a major theme is the tension between the administration of reason-based science and human emotional life. It is available in English translation.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2111016", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2111016", "title": "Tapestry (Star Trek: The Next Generation)", "text": "Tapestry (Star Trek: The Next Generation)\n\n\"Tapestry\" is the 15th episode of the of the American science fiction television series \"\", the 141st overall. It was originally released on February 15, 1993, in broadcast syndication. Ronald D. Moore was credited with writing the episode, but the basis of the story was a collaborative effort from the writing crew. \"Tapestry\" was directed by Les Landau, with the title coming from executive producer Michael Piller.\n\nSet in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, Q (John de Lancie) allows a supposedly deceased Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) to re-visit a pivotal event in his youth that he since regrets. Picard changes the past, but upon returning to the present he finds that it made him the man he became. He returns once more to the past and returns it to the way it originally took place. Picard wakes up in the present, unsure if the events took place or if it was as a result of his injury.\n\nA number of previously used screen props were used, including some from the 1956 film \"The Ten Commandments\", and from previous episodes. The white room scenes were problematic as there were concerns that the all-white robe worn by de Lancie would make him appear to be a floating head on camera. While Moore was pleased with the episode, Piller was not and some fans complained that it glorified violence. \"Tapestry\" received Nielsen ratings of 13.8 percent, and critics responded very positively with praise directed to the chemistry between Stewart and de Lancie.\n\nDuring a diplomatic mission, Captain Picard is rushed to sickbay due to severe, unexpected injuries. After dying from his wounds, he awakes to find himself in an otherworldly realm, where he is greeted by the god-like alien Q. Q explains that the weapon that shot Picard damaged his artificial heart, and that a natural heart would have survived. Picard lost his original heart as a young officer, when he was stabbed during a bar brawl, an event he regrets, but which led to him becoming the disciplined and restrained man he is today. When Picard remarks that he would do things differently if he could relive that moment, Q sends Picard back in time to two days before the brawl, where he meets with fellow cadets and friends Corey Zweller and Marta Batanides. They are surprised by Picard's change of personality; no more devil-may-care attitude.\n\nZweller is cheated by a group of Nausicaans at a bar game, and plans his revenge by rigging the next match. When the Nausicaans lose, they are enraged and goad Zweller. Instead of joining the fight as he did before, Picard holds Zweller back, averting tragedy but humiliating his friend. Corey leaves him in disgust. Marta is attracted by Picard's unexpectedly mature behavior and has a one-night stand with him, but it complicates their friendship.\n\nQ returns Picard to the \"Enterprise\" in the present. Instead of being captain, Picard is a junior science officer who has led an unremarkable career doing routine work. Picard consults Commander Riker and Counselor Troi, who explains that his aversion to risk means he has never distinguished himself.\n\nPicard confronts Q, who tells him that although the fight with the Nausicaan nearly cost him his life, it also gave him a sense of his mortality. It taught him that life was too precious to squander by playing it safe. Picard realizes that his attempts to suppress and ignore the consequences of his indiscretions have resulted in him losing a part of himself. Picard declares that he would rather die as captain of the \"Enterprise\" than live as a nobody. Q sends him back to the bar fight and events unfold as they did originally, with Picard being stabbed through the heart and laughing as he collapses to the floor. Picard awakens in sickbay, a Captain again. As Picard recovers from his injury, he wonders whether his journey into the past was one of Q's tricks or merely a dream. Regardless, he is grateful for the insight the experience gave him.\n\nThis was the first time that Ronald D. Moore wrote a Q-based episode, and he was excited by the idea of giving Picard a near-death experience and Q appearing to the Captain as if he were God. His plan for \"Tapestry\" was to follow a similar path to Charles Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol\", but with Q playing a similar role to the three ghosts in Dickens' story. Moore envisaged three stages to the story, one where Picard is attacked and needs an artificial heart, another with Picard as a child and a third based on the USS \"Stargazer\". He pitched the idea to executive producer Michael Piller, who wasn't enthusiastic about the premise. The combination of that disapproval and the expected cost of filming because of the additional sets required meant that the episode had to be trimmed.\n\nMoore discussed the idea with other members of the writing staff; they focused on the incident which caused Picard to require an artificial heart. It had previously been mentioned in the episodes \"Samaritan Snare\" and \"Final Mission\". They compared Picard to Captain James T. Kirk, describing them as opposites in terms of development. They saw Picard being a wild child during his time at Starfleet Academy, only to become more serious later. The reverse was true for Kirk, with the staff describing him as a \"bookworm\" while at the Academy and only becoming \"crazy\" once posted to a starship. Together, they sought for a way to support Picard's claim in \"Samaritan Snare\" that he laughed when he was stabbed. Story editor René Echevarria said that \"It made us all think we had really come up with the right story for the premise and tying that together, I think it's one of the finest efforts ever.\" While Moore called the episode \"A Q Carol\" based on the original premise, Piller was the one to suggest \"Tapestry\" as he said \"you have to learn to set your part of the tapestry of your life\".\n\nHowever, the writers could not remember the source of the \"white room\" idea, and it was only after the episode aired that James Mooring contacted the staff. He had submitted a spec script featuring a similar idea. Producer Jeri Taylor admitted that the similarity was unintentional, and after both she and Moore spoke to Mooring, the matter was settled. Mooring was paid, and his contribution to the episode was acknowledged by the staff. There were several changes made to the script prior to filming, including the removal of Edward Jellico as the Captain of the \"Enterprise\" in Picard's alternative future and clarification that the stabbing of Picard was not the major event in his life which Boothby described in \"The First Duty\".\n\nJohn de Lancie returned to the series in \"Tapestry\" as Q, having appeared on a regular basis since his first appearance in the pilot, \"Encounter at Farpoint\". He had already appeared twice during the 1992/93 television series as the character, both earlier in the season in \"True Q\" as well as the \"\" episode \"Q-Less\". De Lancie thought that the script for \"Tapestry\" was \"terrific\", and praised the speech he got to perform at the end of the episode.\n\nAppearing for the first time in \"Star Trek\" was J.C. Brandy as Marta Batanides. She was nervous and intimidated to work with Patrick Stewart, but said that everyone on the cast and crew made her feel welcome. However, there were concerns when she first arrived on set for costume fitting as she looked quite young, and Stewart was worried about the age difference on screen. Director Les Landau requested that the hair and make-up on Brandy should make her look older. Brandy said that this \"worked nicely\", but they still \"downplayed the sex\". She was pleased with her scenes with Stewart, as they managed to capture a \"nervousness and innocence\" in Picard and Marta's relationship. The episode marked the first appearance of the Nausicaans on screen with Clint Carmichael playing the lead alien, although they had been mentioned earlier in the episode \"Samaritan Snare\". The two non-speaking members of the race were portrayed by stuntmen Tom Morta and Dick Dimitri. The two appeared on screen without make-up in the episodes \"A Fistful of Datas\" and \",\" respectively.\n\nA significant number of previously created costumes and make-up were included in the barroom scenes in \"Tapestry\". There were notes from the producers not to include any Ferengi, as at that point the Federation had not yet made first contact with them. The scene featured both Anticans and Selay close to one another, despite being at war at the time that this flashback scene was set and only making peace earlier in \"The Next Generation\" in the episode \"Lonely Among Us\". Several of the glasses and other props in this scene were from a collection that Paramount had stored from the 1956 Charlton Heston film, \"The Ten Commandments\". There were problems with the audio recordings of some scenes with Stewart and Brandy, as the camera dolly was noisy which required them to re-record their lines later so that they could be dubbed over the originals. Brandy was \"amazed\" that there was no difference she could tell in Stewart's performance, but felt that it took away an element from her performance.\n\nThe scenes with Q and Picard together on a white background were compared to those in the Warren Beatty and Buck Henry 1978 film \"Heaven Can Wait\" by producer Merri Howard and director of photography Jonathan West. These particular scenes caused some problems as there were concerns by the director of photography that Q's white robes would not show up on camera well against the all-white background. They were worried that he might appear simply as a floating head. With both de Lancie and Stewart anticipating re-shoots for these scenes, they were both unhappy as they shot those appearances. However, this was filmed late on the last day; de Lancie said that it resulted in both of them looking quite tired. Some scenes were cut in order to reduce the episode down to the required length. This included a one-page monologue by Marta which would have taken place the morning after her liaison with Picard, a scene where Picard was to report to La Forge in engineering, audio mention of Dr. Selar and a mention of Scobee Hall – a reference to Dick Scobee, the commander of the Space Shuttle \"Challenger\" at the time of the destruction of the vessel.\n\nMichele and Duncan Barrett describe in their book \"Star Trek: The Human Frontier\", that \"Tapestry\" has \"complex implications\" as it demonstrates who a person is by the experiences they have had throughout their life as well as who that person truly is. They also wrote that Picard was not required to pay a price for his resurrection at the hands of Q due to \"popular narrative being what it is\". In Atara Stein's \"The Byronic Hero in Film, Fiction, and Television\", the author describes \"Tapestry\" as showing a change in Q from his usual satanic stance and instead taking on the role of Picard's guardian angel. Stein also references the alien's increasing influence on the personal lives of the \"Enterprise\" crew, a path which Q began in the episode \"Hide and Q\".\n\n\"Tapestry\" was originally released in broadcast syndication on February 15, 1993. It received Nielsen ratings of 13.8 percent, placing it in third place in its timeslot. This was the joint second highest rating received by an episode during the sixth season, alongside the second part of \"\". The only episode which had higher Nielsen Ratings during that season was \"Aquiel\", which aired two weeks prior to \"Tapestry\".\n\nWhile the majority of the staff were pleased with \"Tapestry\", Piller felt that the premise was tired and was concerned that it was simply a take on the film \"It's a Wonderful Life\". He said that some scenes were \"very talky\", and the direction and some performances were \"flat\". Moore participated in an AOL chat in 1997, where he described \"Tapestry\" as \"one of the best things I wrote and one of \"TNG\"s finest episodes\". Some fans wrote in to the staff to complain that the episode glorified violence, and was against the principles of \"Star Trek\". Jeri Taylor admitted that the episode could be seen as violent, but it never crossed the mind of any of the staff during production. She went on to say that if they had realized that \"Tapestry\" could be considered to promote violence, then they would have corrected it to ensure that it wouldn't be viewed as such.\n\nReviewers responded positively to \"Tapestry\". Zack Handlen, writing for \"The A.V. Club\", compared \"Tapestry\" to the television series \"Quantum Leap\" with the older Picard jumping into the younger man's body. He also said it had the \"feel\" of \"A Christmas Carol\", and that it was a \"modest episode, with a modest goal: to remind us that [we] are the sum of all our parts, even the ones we aren't very proud of.\" He gave the episode a rating of \"A\".\n\nIn a review for Tor.com, Keith DeCandido compared the episode to \"It's a Wonderful Life\", calling it one of the \"finest hours\" of the series. He praised \"Tapestry\" for endorsing the Q/Picard chemistry at the heart of Q episodes, and said that Stewart and de Lancie \"play off each other magnificently\". He gave it a rating of 9 out of 10.\n\nIn their book \"The Unauthorized Trek: The Complete Next Generation\", James Van Hise and Hal Schuster described the scene where Picard was stabbed through the chest as \"particularly violent\", and overall said that \"Tapestry\" was a good story. They also described the view of \"Star Trek\" creator Gene Roddenberry towards religion, saying that in his world the Q Continuum aren't gods but are instead an \"evolutionary niche higher than mere mortals\". Mark Clark, in his book \"Star Trek FAQ 2.0\", called Stewart's performance \"richly nuanced\" and \"soul searching\". Clark said that this episode was as important to Picard as the events in \"\", \"\" and \"\". He said that the events of \"Tapestry\" explored Picard's soul.\n\nThe episode has been included in \"best of\" lists for both specifically \"The Next Generation\" and more generally for the entire franchise. It ranked ninth on TV Guide's list of the top 10 \"Star Trek\" episodes for the franchise's 30th anniversary, fourth in \"Entertainment Weekly\"s list of top 10 \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" episodes, 22nd out of the top 100 of the entire franchise in Charlie Jane Anders' list for io9, and 7th out of the various \"Star Trek\" episodes involving time travel by James Hunt at Den of Geek. Witney Seibold, on the website Crave Online said that \"Tapestry\" was the best installment of \"The Next Generation\", describing it as \"one of the more philosophical episodes\". In 2016, Radio Times rated the scene where Picard wakes up to find Q in his bed as the 41st greatest scene in \"Star Trek\". In 2014, Gizmodo ranked \"Tapestry\" as the 22nd best episode of \"Star Trek\", out of over 700 episodes made by that time.\n\nIn 2016, IGN ranked \"Tapestry\" the 18th best episode of all \"Star Trek\" series.\n\nIn 2016 \"The Hollywood Reporter\" rated \"Tapestry\" the 16th best television episode of \"Star Trek\". Geek.com rated the presentation of 'Lieutenant Picard' as one of the greatest moments in \"Star Trek\". In 2018, \"Entertainment Weekly\" ranked \"Tapestry\" as one of the top ten moments of Jean-Luc Picard.\nIn May 2019, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" ranked \"Tapestry\" among the top twenty five episodes of \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\".\n\nIn 2017, \"Nerdist\" ranked \"Tapestry\" the seventh best episode of \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\".\n\nIn 2017, \"Den of Geek\" ranked this episode as one of a top 25 \"must watch\" episodes of \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\".\n\nIn 2018, CBR ranked \"Tapestry\" the seventh best time-travel episode of all \"Star Trek\".\n\nIn 2019, \"Screen Rant\" ranked \"Tapestry\" the 9th best episode of \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\".\n\nIn 2019, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" listed this among the twenty five best episodes of \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\".\n\nIn 2020, IGN and Vulture Magazine listed \"Tapestry\" on a list of \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" episodes to watch before \"\".\n\n\"Tapestry\" was released in the United Kingdom on a two-episode VHS tape in 2003, alongside the first part of \"\". The first home media release of \"Tapestry\" in the United States was on a VHS box set entitled \"Star Trek – The Next Generation: The Q Continuum\" on June 18, 1996. It later received an individual release on August 4, 1998. Paramount deliberately delayed the individual release of \"Star Trek\" episodes on VHS within the United States in order to allow for the syndicated series to be shown once more in full. The inclusion of \"Tapestry\" in \"The Q Continuum\" boxed set ahead of the individual release of the episode was intended as an incentive to purchase the set.\n\nThe episode was released as part of the \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" season six DVD box set in the United States on December 3, 2002. It received further releases on DVD as part of a compilation collections of episodes. This included \"The Jean-Luc Picard Collection\", which was released in the United States on August 3, 2004, also the \"Star Trek: Q Fan Collective\", which was released in the United States on June 6, 2006, and later that year in the UK on September 4. A further DVD release came as part of \"The Best of Star Trek: The Next Generation – Volume 2\" on November 17, 2009, in the United States. The most recent release was the first on Blu-ray disc, which took place on June 24, 2014; this also added an audio commentary track for the episode for the first time.\n\nDeCandido described Picard's laugh at being stabbed in \"Tapestry\" as being \"critical to the plot\" of his non-canon \"Star Trek\" novel \"Q & A\". The novel also includes Q's white room, and features a similar alternative universe where Picard followed a career in the sciences. A figure of Captain Picard based on \"Tapestry\" was released by Playmates Toys in 1996, which was a limited edition release of 1,701 units.\n\n"}

{"id": "2111048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2111048", "title": "Earthquake engineering", "text": "Earthquake engineering\n\nEarthquake engineering is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering that designs and analyzes structures, such as buildings and bridges, with earthquakes in mind. Its overall goal is to make such structures more resistant to earthquakes. An earthquake (or seismic) engineer aims to construct structures that will not be damaged in minor shaking and will avoid serious damage or collapse in a major earthquake. Earthquake engineering is the scientific field concerned with protecting society, the natural environment, and the man-made environment from earthquakes by limiting the seismic risk to socio-economically acceptable levels. Traditionally, it has been narrowly defined as the study of the behavior of structures and geo-structures subject to seismic loading; it is considered as a subset of structural engineering, geotechnical engineering, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, applied physics, etc. However, the tremendous costs experienced in recent earthquakes have led to an expansion of its scope to encompass disciplines from the wider field of civil engineering, mechanical engineering, nuclear engineering, and from the social sciences, especially sociology, political science, economics, and finance.\n\nThe main objectives of earthquake engineering are:\n\nA properly engineered structure does not necessarily have to be extremely strong or expensive. It has to be properly designed to withstand the seismic effects while sustaining an acceptable level of damage.\n\nSeismic loading means application of an earthquake-generated excitation on a structure (or geo-structure). It happens at contact surfaces of a structure either with the ground, with adjacent structures, or with gravity waves from tsunami. The loading that is expected at a given location on the Earth's surface is estimated by engineering seismology. It is related to the seismic hazard of the location.\n\nEarthquake or seismic performance defines a structure's ability to sustain its main functions, such as its safety and serviceability, \"at\" and \"after\" a particular earthquake exposure. A structure is normally considered \"safe\" if it does not endanger the lives and well-being of those in or around it by partially or completely collapsing. A structure may be considered \"serviceable\" if it is able to fulfill its operational functions for which it was designed.\n\nBasic concepts of the earthquake engineering, implemented in the major building codes, assume that a building should survive a rare, very severe earthquake by sustaining significant damage but without globally collapsing. On the other hand, it should remain operational for more frequent, but less severe seismic events.\n\nEngineers need to know the quantified level of the actual or anticipated seismic performance associated with the direct damage to an individual building subject to a specified ground shaking.\nSuch an assessment may be performed either experimentally or analytically.\n\nExperimental evaluations are expensive tests that are typically done by placing a (scaled) model of the structure on a shake-table that simulates the earth shaking and observing its behavior. Such kinds of experiments were first performed more than a century ago. Only recently has it become possible to perform 1:1 scale testing on full structures.\n\nDue to the costly nature of such tests, they tend to be used mainly for understanding the seismic behavior of structures, validating models and verifying analysis methods. Thus, once properly validated, computational models and numerical procedures tend to carry the major burden for the seismic performance assessment of structures.\n\nSeismic performance assessment or seismic structural analysis is a powerful tool of earthquake engineering which utilizes detailed modelling of the structure together with methods of structural analysis to gain a better understanding of seismic performance of building and non-building structures. The technique as a formal concept is a relatively recent development.\n\nIn general, seismic structural analysis is based on the methods of structural dynamics. For decades, the most prominent instrument of seismic analysis has been the earthquake response spectrum method which also contributed to the proposed building code's concept of today.\n\nHowever, such methods are good only for linear elastic systems, being largely unable to model the structural behavior when damage (i.e., non-linearity) appears. Numerical \"step-by-step integration\" proved to be a more effective method of analysis for multi-degree-of-freedom structural systems with significant non-linearity under a transient process of ground motion excitation. Use of the finite element method is one of the most common approaches for analyzing non-linear soil structure interaction computer models.\n\nBasically, numerical analysis is conducted in order to evaluate the seismic performance of buildings. Performance evaluations are generally carried out by using nonlinear static pushover analysis or nonlinear time-history analysis. In such analyses, it is essential to achieve accurate non-linear modeling of structural components such as beams, columns, beam-column joints, shear walls etc. Thus, experimental results play an important role in determining the modeling parameters of individual components, especially those that are subject to significant non-linear deformations. The individual components are then assembled to create a full non-linear model of the structure. Thus created models are analyzed to evaluate the performance of buildings.\n\nThe capabilities of the structural analysis software are a major consideration in the above process as they restrict the possible component models, the analysis methods available and, most importantly, the numerical robustness. The latter becomes a major consideration for structures that venture into the non-linear range and approach global or local collapse as the numerical solution becomes increasingly unstable and thus difficult to reach. There are several commercially available Finite Element Analysis software's such as CSI-SAP2000 and CSI-PERFORM-3D, MTR/SASSI, Scia Engineer-ECtools, ABAQUS, and Ansys, all of which can be used for the seismic performance evaluation of buildings. Moreover, there is research-based finite element analysis platforms such as OpenSees, MASTODON, which is based on the MOOSE Framework, RUAUMOKO and the older DRAIN-2D/3D, several of which are now open source.\n\nResearch for earthquake engineering means both field and analytical investigation or experimentation intended for discovery and scientific explanation of earthquake engineering related facts, revision of conventional concepts in the light of new findings, and practical application of the developed theories.\n\nThe National Science Foundation (NSF) is the main United States government agency that supports fundamental research and education in all fields of earthquake engineering. In particular, it focuses on experimental, analytical and computational research on design and performance enhancement of structural systems.\n\nThe Earthquake Engineering Research Institute (EERI) is a leader in dissemination of earthquake engineering research related information both in the U.S. and globally.\n\nA definitive list of earthquake engineering research related shaking tables around the world may be found in Experimental Facilities for Earthquake Engineering Simulation Worldwide. The most prominent of them is now E-Defense Shake Table in Japan.\n\nNSF also supports the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation\n\nThe NSF Hazard Mitigation and Structural Engineering program (HMSE) supports research on new technologies for improving the behavior and response of structural systems subject to earthquake hazards; fundamental research on safety and reliability of constructed systems; innovative developments in analysis and model based simulation of structural behavior and response including soil-structure interaction; design concepts that improve structure performance and flexibility; and application of new control techniques for structural systems.\n\n(NEES) that advances knowledge discovery and innovation for earthquakes and tsunami loss reduction of the nation's civil infrastructure and new experimental simulation techniques and instrumentation.\n\nThe NEES network features 14 geographically-distributed, shared-use laboratories that support several types of experimental work: geotechnical centrifuge research, shake-table tests, large-scale structural testing, tsunami wave basin experiments, and field site research. Participating universities include: Cornell University; Lehigh University; Oregon State University; Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; University at Buffalo, State University of New York; University of California, Berkeley; University of California, Davis; University of California, Los Angeles; University of California, San Diego; University of California, Santa Barbara; University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign; University of Minnesota; University of Nevada, Reno; and the University of Texas, Austin.\n\nThe equipment sites (labs) and a central data repository are connected to the global earthquake engineering community via the NEEShub website. The NEES website is powered by HUBzero software developed at Purdue University for nanoHUB specifically to help the scientific community share resources and collaborate. The cyberinfrastructure, connected via Internet2, provides interactive simulation tools, a simulation tool development area, a curated central data repository, animated presentations, user support, telepresence, mechanism for uploading and sharing resources, and statistics about users and usage patterns.\n\nThis cyberinfrastructure allows researchers to: securely store, organize and share data within a standardized framework in a central location; remotely observe and participate in experiments through the use of synchronized real-time data and video; collaborate with colleagues to facilitate the planning, performance, analysis, and publication of research experiments; and conduct computational and hybrid simulations that may combine the results of multiple distributed experiments and link physical experiments with computer simulations to enable the investigation of overall system performance.\n\nThese resources jointly provide the means for collaboration and discovery to improve the seismic design and performance of civil and mechanical infrastructure systems.\n\nThe very first earthquake simulations were performed by statically applying some \"horizontal inertia forces\" based on scaled peak ground accelerations to a mathematical model of a building. With the further development of computational technologies, static approaches began to give way to dynamic ones.\n\nDynamic experiments on building and non-building structures may be physical, like shake-table testing, or virtual ones. In both cases, to verify a structure's expected seismic performance, some researchers prefer to deal with so called \"real time-histories\" though the last cannot be \"real\" for a hypothetical earthquake specified by either a building code or by some particular research requirements. Therefore, there is a strong incentive to engage an earthquake simulation which is the seismic input that possesses only essential features of a real event.\n\nSometimes earthquake simulation is understood as a re-creation of local effects of a strong earth shaking.\n\nTheoretical or experimental evaluation of anticipated seismic performance mostly requires a structure simulation which is based on the concept of structural likeness or similarity. Similarity is some degree of analogy or resemblance between two or more objects. The notion of similarity rests either on exact or approximate repetitions of patterns in the compared items.\n\nIn general, a building model is said to have similarity with the real object if the two share \"geometric similarity\", \"kinematic similarity\" and \"dynamic similarity\". The most vivid and effective type of similarity is the \"kinematic\" one. \"Kinematic similarity\" exists when the paths and velocities of moving particles of a model and its prototype are similar.\n\nThe ultimate level of \"kinematic similarity\" is \"kinematic equivalence\" when, in the case of earthquake engineering, time-histories of each story lateral displacements of the model and its prototype would be the same.\n\nSeismic vibration control is a set of technical means aimed to mitigate seismic impacts in building and non-building structures. All seismic vibration control devices may be classified as \"passive\", \"active\" or \"hybrid\" where:\n\n\nWhen ground seismic waves reach up and start to penetrate a base of a building, their energy flow density, due to reflections, reduces dramatically: usually, up to 90%. However, the remaining portions of the incident waves during a major earthquake still bear a huge devastating potential.\n\nAfter the seismic waves enter a superstructure, there are a number of ways to control them in order to soothe their damaging effect and improve the building's seismic performance, for instance:\n\nDevices of the last kind, abbreviated correspondingly as TMD for the tuned (\"passive\"), as AMD for the \"active\", and as HMD for the \"hybrid mass dampers\", have been studied and installed in high-rise buildings, predominantly in Japan, for a quarter of a century.\n\nHowever, there is quite another approach: partial suppression of the seismic energy flow into the superstructure known as seismic or base isolation.\n\nFor this, some pads are inserted into or under all major load-carrying elements in the base of the building which should substantially decouple a superstructure from its substructure resting on a shaking ground.\n\nThe first evidence of earthquake protection by using the principle of base isolation was discovered in Pasargadae, a city in ancient Persia, now Iran, and dates back to the 6th century BCE. Below, there are some samples of seismic vibration control technologies of today.\n\nPeru is a highly seismic land; for centuries the dry-stone construction proved to be more earthquake-resistant than using mortar. \nPeople of Inca civilization were masters of the polished 'dry-stone walls', called ashlar, where blocks of stone were cut to fit together tightly without any mortar. The Incas were among the best stonemasons the world has ever seen and many junctions in their masonry were so perfect that even blades of grass could not fit between the stones.\n\nThe stones of the dry-stone walls built by the Incas could move slightly and resettle without the walls collapsing, a passive structural control technique employing both the principle of energy dissipation (coulomb damping) and that of suppressing resonant amplifications.\n\nTypically the tuned mass dampers are huge concrete blocks mounted in skyscrapers or other structures and move in opposition to the resonance frequency oscillations of the structures by means of some sort of spring mechanism.\n\nThe Taipei 101 skyscraper needs to withstand typhoon winds and earthquake tremors common in this area of Asia/Pacific. For this purpose, a steel pendulum weighing 660 metric tonnes that serves as a tuned mass damper was designed and installed atop the structure. Suspended from the 92nd to the 88th floor, the pendulum sways to decrease resonant amplifications of lateral displacements in the building caused by earthquakes and strong gusts.\nA hysteretic damper is intended to provide better and more reliable seismic performance than that of a conventional structure by increasing the dissipation of seismic input energy. There are five major groups of hysteretic dampers used for the purpose, namely:\n\nViscous Dampers have the benefit of being a supplemental damping system. They have an oval hysteretic loop and the damping is velocity dependent. While some minor maintenance is potentially required, viscous dampers generally do not need to be replaced after an earthquake. While more expensive than other damping technologies they can be used for both seismic and wind loads and are the most commonly used hysteretic damper.\n\nFriction dampers tend to be available in two major types, linear and rotational and dissipate energy by heat. The damper operates on the principle of a coulomb damper. Depending on the design, friction dampers can experience stick-slip phenomenon and Cold welding. The main disadvantage being that friction surfaces can wear over time and for this reason they are not recommended for dissipating wind loads. When used in seismic applications wear is not a problem and there is no required maintenance. They have a rectangular hysteretic loop and as long as the building is sufficiently elastic they tend to settle back to their original positions after an earthquake.\n\nMetallic yielding dampers, as the name implies, yield in order to absorb the earthquake's energy. This type of damper absorbs a large amount of energy however they must be replaced after an earthquake and may prevent the building from settling back to its original position.\n\nViscoelastic dampers are useful in that they can be used for both wind and seismic applications, they are usually limited to small displacements. There is some concern as to the reliability of the technology as some brands have been banned from use in buildings in the United States.\n\nBase isolation seeks to prevent the kinetic energy of the earthquake from being transferred into elastic energy in the building. These technologies do so by isolating the structure from the ground, thus enabling them to move somewhat independently. The degree to which the energy is transferred into the structure and how the energy is dissipated will vary depending on the technology used.\n\nLead rubber bearing or LRB is a type of base isolation employing a heavy damping. It was invented by Bill Robinson, a New Zealander.\n\nHeavy damping mechanism incorporated in vibration control technologies and, particularly, in base isolation devices, is often considered a valuable source of suppressing vibrations thus enhancing a building's seismic performance. However, for the rather pliant systems such as base isolated structures, with a relatively low bearing stiffness but with a high damping, the so-called \"damping force\" may turn out the main pushing force at a strong earthquake. The video shows a Lead Rubber Bearing being tested at the UCSD Caltrans-SRMD facility. The bearing is made of rubber with a lead core. It was a uniaxial test in which the bearing was also under a full structure load. Many buildings and bridges, both in New Zealand and elsewhere, are protected with lead dampers and lead and rubber bearings. Te Papa Tongarewa, the national museum of New Zealand, and the New Zealand Parliament Buildings have been fitted with the bearings. Both are in Wellington which sits on an active fault.\n\nSprings-with-damper base isolator installed under a three-story town-house, Santa Monica, California is shown on the photo taken prior to the 1994 Northridge earthquake exposure. It is a base isolation device conceptually similar to \"Lead Rubber Bearing\".\n\nOne of two three-story town-houses like this, which was well instrumented for recording of both vertical and horizontal accelerations on its floors and the ground, has survived a severe shaking during the Northridge earthquake and left valuable recorded information for further study.\n\nSimple roller bearing is a base isolation device which is intended for protection of various building and non-building structures against potentially damaging lateral impacts of strong earthquakes.\n\nThis metallic bearing support may be adapted, with certain precautions, as a seismic isolator to skyscrapers and buildings on soft ground. Recently, it has been employed under the name of \"metallic roller bearing\" for a housing complex (17 stories) in Tokyo, Japan.\n\nFriction pendulum bearing (FPB) is another name of friction pendulum system (FPS). It is based on three pillars:\n\nSnapshot with the link to video clip of a shake-table testing of FPB system supporting a rigid building model is presented at the right.\n\nSeismic design is based on authorized engineering procedures, principles and criteria meant to design or retrofit structures subject to earthquake exposure. Those criteria are only consistent with the contemporary state of the knowledge about earthquake engineering structures. Therefore, a building design which exactly follows seismic code regulations does not guarantee safety against collapse or serious damage.\n\nThe price of poor seismic design may be enormous. Nevertheless, seismic design has always been a trial and error process whether it was based on physical laws or on empirical knowledge of the structural performance of different shapes and materials.\n\nTo practice seismic design, seismic analysis or seismic evaluation of new and existing civil engineering projects, an engineer should, normally, pass examination on \"Seismic Principles\" which, in the State of California, include:\n\nTo build up complex structural systems, seismic design largely uses the same relatively small number of basic structural elements (to say nothing of vibration control devices) as any non-seismic design project.\n\nNormally, according to building codes, structures are designed to \"withstand\" the largest earthquake of a certain probability that is likely to occur at their location. This means the loss of life should be minimized by preventing collapse of the buildings.\n\nSeismic design is carried out by understanding the possible failure modes of a structure and providing the structure with appropriate strength, stiffness, ductility, and configuration to ensure those modes cannot occur.\n\nSeismic design requirements depend on the type of the structure, locality of the project and its authorities which stipulate applicable seismic design codes and criteria. For instance, California Department of Transportation's requirements called \"The Seismic Design Criteria\" (SDC) and aimed at the design of new bridges in California incorporate an innovative seismic performance-based approach.\n\nThe most significant feature in the SDC design philosophy is a shift from a \"force-based assessment\" of seismic demand to a \"displacement-based assessment\" of demand and capacity. Thus, the newly adopted displacement approach is based on comparing the \"elastic displacement\" demand to the \"inelastic displacement\" capacity of the primary structural components while ensuring a minimum level of inelastic capacity at all potential plastic hinge locations.\n\nIn addition to the designed structure itself, seismic design requirements may include a \"ground stabilization\" underneath the structure: sometimes, heavily shaken ground breaks up which leads to collapse of the structure sitting upon it.\nThe following topics should be of primary concerns: liquefaction; dynamic lateral earth pressures on retaining walls; seismic slope stability; earthquake-induced settlement.\n\nNuclear facilities should not jeopardise their safety in case of earthquakes or other hostile external events. Therefore, their seismic design is based on criteria far more stringent than those applying to non-nuclear facilities. The Fukushima I nuclear accidents and damage to other nuclear facilities that followed the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami have, however, drawn attention to ongoing concerns over Japanese nuclear seismic design standards and caused other many governments to re-evaluate their nuclear programs. Doubt has also been expressed over the seismic evaluation and design of certain other plants, including the Fessenheim Nuclear Power Plant in France.\n\nFailure mode is the manner by which an earthquake induced failure is observed. It, generally, describes the way the failure occurs. Though costly and time consuming, learning from each real earthquake failure remains a routine recipe for advancement in \"seismic design\" methods. Below, some typical modes of earthquake-generated failures are presented.\n\nThe lack of reinforcement coupled with poor mortar and inadequate roof-to-wall ties can result in substantial damage to an unreinforced masonry building. Severely cracked or leaning walls are some of the most common earthquake damage. Also hazardous is the damage that may occur between the walls and roof or floor diaphragms. Separation between the framing and the walls can jeopardize the vertical support of roof and floor systems.\n\nSoft story effect. Absence of adequate stiffness on the ground level caused damage to this structure. A close examination of the image reveals that the rough board siding, once covered by a brick veneer, has been completely dismantled from the studwall. Only the rigidity of the floor above combined with the support on the two hidden sides by continuous walls, not penetrated with large doors as on the street sides, is preventing full collapse of the structure.\n\nSoil liquefaction. In the cases where the soil consists of loose granular deposited materials with the tendency to develop excessive hydrostatic pore water pressure of sufficient magnitude and compact, liquefaction of those loose saturated deposits may result in non-uniform settlements and tilting of structures. This caused major damage to thousands of buildings in Niigata, Japan during the 1964 earthquake.\n\nLandslide rock fall. A landslide is a geological phenomenon which includes a wide range of ground movement, including rock falls. Typically, the action of gravity is the primary driving force for a landslide to occur though in this case there was another contributing factor which affected the original slope stability: the landslide required an \"earthquake trigger\" before being released.\n\nPounding against adjacent building. This is a photograph of the collapsed five-story tower, St. Joseph's Seminary, Los Altos, California which resulted in one fatality. During Loma Prieta earthquake, the tower pounded against the independently vibrating adjacent building behind. A possibility of pounding depends on both buildings' lateral displacements which should be accurately estimated and accounted for.\n\nAt Northridge earthquake, the Kaiser Permanente concrete frame office building had joints completely shattered, revealing inadequate confinement steel, which resulted in the second story collapse. In the transverse direction, composite end shear walls, consisting of two wythes of brick and a layer of shotcrete that carried the lateral load, peeled apart because of inadequate through-ties and failed.\n\n\nSliding off foundations effect of a relatively rigid residential building structure during 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake. The magnitude 5.9 earthquake pounded the Garvey West Apartment building in Monterey Park, California and shifted its superstructure about 10 inches to the east on its foundation.\n\nIf a superstructure is not mounted on a base isolation system, its shifting on the basement should be prevented.\n\nReinforced concrete column burst at Northridge earthquake due to insufficient shear reinforcement mode which allows main reinforcement to buckle outwards. The deck unseated at the hinge and failed in shear. As a result, the La Cienega-Venice underpass section of the 10 Freeway collapsed.\n\nLoma Prieta earthquake: side view of reinforced concrete support-columns failure which triggered the upper deck collapse onto the lower deck of the two-level Cypress viaduct of Interstate Highway 880, Oakland, CA.\n\nRetaining wall failure at Loma Prieta earthquake in Santa Cruz Mountains area: prominent northwest-trending extensional cracks up to 12 cm (4.7 in) wide in the concrete spillway to Austrian Dam, the north abutment.\n\nGround shaking triggered soil liquefaction in a subsurface layer of sand, producing differential lateral and vertical movement in an overlying carapace of unliquified sand and silt. This mode of ground failure, termed lateral spreading, is a principal cause of liquefaction-related earthquake damage.\n\nSeverely damaged building of Agriculture Development Bank of China after 2008 Sichuan earthquake: most of the beams and pier columns are sheared. Large diagonal cracks in masonry and veneer are due to in-plane loads while abrupt settlement of the right end of the building should be attributed to a landfill which may be hazardous even without any earthquake.\n\nTwofold tsunami impact: sea waves hydraulic pressure and inundation. Thus, the Indian Ocean earthquake of December 26, 2004, with the epicenter off the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, triggered a series of devastating tsunamis, killing more than 230,000 people in eleven countries by inundating surrounding coastal communities with huge waves up to 30 meters (100 feet) high.\n\nEarthquake construction means implementation of seismic design to enable building and non-building structures to live through the anticipated earthquake exposure up to the expectations and in compliance with the applicable building codes.\n\nDesign and construction are intimately related. To achieve a good workmanship, detailing of the members and their connections should be as simple as possible. As any construction in general, earthquake construction is a process that consists of the building, retrofitting or assembling of infrastructure given the construction materials available.\n\nThe destabilizing action of an earthquake on constructions may be \"direct\" (seismic motion of the ground) or \"indirect\" (earthquake-induced landslides, soil liquefaction and waves of tsunami).\n\nA structure might have all the appearances of stability, yet offer nothing but danger when an earthquake occurs. The crucial fact is that, for safety, earthquake-resistant construction techniques are as important as quality control and using correct materials. \"Earthquake contractor\" should be registered in the state/province/country of the project location (depending on local regulations), bonded and insured .\n\nTo minimize possible losses, construction process should be organized with keeping in mind that earthquake may strike any time prior to the end of construction.\n\nEach construction project requires a qualified team of professionals who understand the basic features of seismic performance of different structures as well as construction management.\n\nAround thirty percent of the world's population lives or works in earth-made construction. Adobe type of mud bricks is one of the oldest and most widely used building materials. The use of adobe is very common in some of the world's most hazard-prone regions, traditionally across Latin America, Africa, Indian subcontinent and other parts of Asia, Middle East and Southern Europe.\n\nAdobe buildings are considered very vulnerable at strong quakes. However, multiple ways of seismic strengthening of new and existing adobe buildings are available.\n\nKey factors for the improved seismic performance of\nadobe construction are:\n\nLimestone is very common in architecture, especially in North America and Europe. Many landmarks across the world are made of limestone. Many medieval churches and castles in Europe are made of limestone and sandstone masonry. They are the long-lasting materials but their rather heavy weight is not beneficial for adequate seismic performance.\n\nApplication of modern technology to seismic retrofitting can enhance the survivability of unreinforced masonry structures. As an example, from 1973 to 1989, the Salt Lake City and County Building in Utah was exhaustively renovated and repaired with an emphasis on preserving historical accuracy in appearance. This was done in concert with a seismic upgrade that placed the weak sandstone structure on base isolation foundation to better protect it from earthquake damage.\n\nTimber framing dates back thousands of years, and has been used in many parts of the world during various periods such as ancient Japan, Europe and medieval England in localities where timber was in good supply and building stone and the skills to work it were not.\n\nThe use of timber framing in buildings provides their complete skeletal framing which offers some structural benefits as the timber frame, if properly engineered, lends itself to better \"seismic survivability\".\n\nLight-frame structures usually gain seismic resistance from rigid plywood shear walls and wood structural panel diaphragms. Special provisions for seismic load-resisting systems for all engineered wood structures requires consideration of diaphragm ratios, horizontal and vertical diaphragm shears, and connector/fastener values. In addition, collectors, or drag struts, to distribute shear along a diaphragm length are required.\n\nA construction system where steel reinforcement is embedded in the mortar joints of masonry or placed in holes and after filled with concrete or grout is called reinforced masonry.\n\nThe devastating 1933 Long Beach earthquake revealed that masonry construction should be improved immediately. Then, the California State Code made the reinforced masonry mandatory.\n\nThere are various practices and techniques to achieve reinforced masonry. The most common type is the reinforced hollow unit masonry. The effectiveness of both vertical and horizontal reinforcement strongly depends on the type and quality of the masonry, i.e. masonry units and mortar.\n\nTo achieve a ductile behavior of masonry, it is necessary that the shear strength of the wall is greater than the flexural strength.\n\nReinforced concrete is concrete in which steel reinforcement bars (rebars) or fibers have been incorporated to strengthen a material that would otherwise be brittle. It can be used to produce beams, columns, floors or bridges.\n\nPrestressed concrete is a kind of reinforced concrete used for overcoming concrete's natural weakness in tension. It can be applied to beams, floors or bridges with a longer span than is practical with ordinary reinforced concrete. Prestressing tendons (generally of high tensile steel cable or rods) are used to provide a clamping load which produces a compressive stress that offsets the tensile stress that the concrete compression member would, otherwise, experience due to a bending load.\n\nTo prevent catastrophic collapse in response earth shaking (in the interest of life safety), a traditional reinforced concrete frame should have ductile joints. Depending upon the methods used and the imposed seismic forces, such buildings may be immediately usable, require extensive repair, or may have to be demolished.\n\nPrestressed structure is the one whose overall integrity, stability and security depend, primarily, on a \"prestressing\". \"Prestressing\" means the intentional creation of permanent stresses in a structure for the purpose of improving its performance under various service conditions.\nThere are the following basic types of prestressing:\nToday, the concept of prestressed structure is widely engaged in design of buildings, underground structures, TV towers, power stations, floating storage and offshore facilities, nuclear reactor vessels, and numerous kinds of bridge systems.\n\nA beneficial idea of \"prestressing\" was, apparently, familiar to the ancient Rome architects; look, e.g., at the tall attic wall of Colosseum working as a stabilizing device for the wall piers beneath.\n\nSteel structures are considered mostly earthquake resistant but some failures have occurred. A great number of welded steel moment-resisting frame buildings, which looked earthquake-proof, surprisingly experienced brittle behavior and were hazardously damaged in the 1994 Northridge earthquake. After that, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) initiated development of repair techniques and new design approaches to minimize damage to steel moment frame buildings in future earthquakes.\n\nFor structural steel seismic design based on Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) approach, it is very important to assess ability of a structure to develop and maintain its bearing resistance in the inelastic range. A measure of this ability is ductility, which may be observed in a \"material itself\", in a \"structural element\", or to a \"whole structure\".\n\nAs a consequence of Northridge earthquake experience, the American Institute of Steel Construction has introduced AISC 358 \"Pre-Qualified Connections for Special and intermediate Steel Moment Frames.\" The AISC Seismic Design Provisions require that all Steel Moment Resisting Frames employ either connections contained in AISC 358, or the use of connections that have been subjected to pre-qualifying cyclic testing.\n\nEarthquake loss estimation is usually defined as a \"Damage Ratio\" (DR) which is a ratio of the earthquake damage repair cost to the total value of a building. \"Probable Maximum Loss\" (PML) is a common term used for earthquake loss estimation, but it lacks a precise definition. In 1999, ASTM E2026 'Standard Guide for the Estimation of Building Damageability in Earthquakes' was produced in order to standardize the nomenclature for seismic loss estimation, as well as establish guidelines as to the review process and qualifications of the reviewer.\n\nEarthquake loss estimations are also referred to as \"Seismic Risk Assessments\". The risk assessment process generally involves determining the probability of various ground motions coupled with the vulnerability or damage of the building under those ground motions. The results are defined as a percent of building replacement value.\n\n\n"}

The album was released by Motown Records in the U.S. on May 15, 1984.\n\nThe nine songs featured on the album were reportedly lost by Motown but rediscovered in 1984. To give the album a more contemporary sound, Motown remixed the songs and added all new musical overdubs. The task of playing the updated sound was given to musicians Tony Peluso, Michael Lovesmith and Steve Barri. Together with drummer Mike Baird, they recorded new guitar, keyboard, percussion drum parts for the songs. The album reached No. 46 on \"Billboard\"s pop album chart and No. 9 on the UK Albums Chart and sold over three million copies worldwide. On July 9, 1984, the album was certified Gold by the BPI for selling at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe title song became a Top 40 hit in the US, reaching No. 38, and a Top 10 hit in the United Kingdom, reaching No. 7. At the time, Jackson was riding high on the success of his best-selling album \"Thriller\". A follow-up single, \"Touch the One You Love\", was released in the US and backed by \"Girl You're So Together\", but it failed to chart. In the UK, however, \"Girl You're So Together\" was released as a single, with \"Touch the One You Love\" on the B-side, and became a top 40 hit.\n\nLike Jackson's 1981 compilation \"One Day in Your Life\", \"Farewell My Summer Love\" has not seen an official re-release and is considered to be one of Jackson's rarest albums, although the title track is available on several of Jackson's greatest hits collections. In particular, the 1995 version of \"Anthology\" features the song \"Farewell My Summer Love\" in its 1984 remix, as well as \"Melodie\", \"Don't Let It Get You Down\", \"Call on Me\" and \"To Make My Father Proud\" in their original 1973 versions.

Skaggs Drug Centers bought American Stores in 1979 and assumed the American Stores name. Combined food and drug stores in Alpha Beta territory were re-branded as Skaggs Alpha Beta. In 1984, American Stores bought The Jewel Companies, Inc., which had owned Osco Drug since 1961. \nIn 1984, all 34 Alpha Beta stores in Arizona were sold to ABCO Foods, and the stores continued operating under the Alpha Beta name. In Tucson, Alpha Beta-branded stores changed to ABCO-branded stores around 1989.\n\nSome Alpha Beta stores carried more than the customary supermarket merchandise. For example, in 1980, a Cupertino, California, Alpha Beta store sold Bohsei color TVs for under $200, Atari 400 and 800 computers, and other goods.\n\nIn September 1991, Skaggs-Alpha Beta re-branded its 76 stores in Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Arkansas as Jewel-Osco, in an attempt to unify some of its subsidiaries under one nationally recognized name. Months later, Albertsons bought some of the Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas stores.\n\nIn 1994, Yucaipa Companies, then owner of the Alpha Beta chain in southern California, purchased the Ralphs Grocery Company. All existing Alpha Beta stores in Southern California were rebranded as Ralphs or Food 4 Less, and the Alpha Beta name ceased to be used by September 1995.\n\nMost remaining Alpha Beta stores in Northern California and the rest of United States were taken over and rebranded by Lucky Stores, which in turn was acquired by Albertsons, triggering another rebranding. Many of the Northern California stores were subsequently sold in 2006 to Save Mart Supermarkets, which had acquired the rights to use the Lucky brand and logo from Albertsons, so many of the stores eventually were rebranded as Lucky. \n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, Alan Hamel was the television spokesman for the Alpha Beta grocery stores in California. Although the chain used various slogans such as \"You Can't Lose\" and \"The Savings Don't Stop\", every commercial featuring Hamel ended with him saying to the audience \"tell a friend\". Popeye was in the Alpha Beta grocery store commercial with Mickey Mouse in the 80s featuring the end of the Alpha Beta commercial with Mickey Mouse saying next to Popeye to the audience \"tell a friend\". Olive Oyl's voiceover ended up saying \"Go shopping with Popeye at Alpha Beta\" and \"Tell A Friend\" at the end of the Alpha Beta commercial in the 80s. Bugs Bunny, Donald Duck, and Hulk Hogan were in the commercial of Alpha Beta grocery store in the 90s featuring Hulk Hogan ended up saying \"Either you're at Alpha Beta or you're not\" next to Bugs Bunny. In the 90s, Looney Tunes were in the commercial of Alpha Beta grocery store commercial and Daffy Duck ended up saying \"Join Looney Tunes at Alpha Beta\", \"Either you're at Alpha Beta or you're not\", and \"Tell A Friend\".\n\n"}

He is an Objectivist and the current chairman of the board at the Ayn Rand Institute, where he was executive director from 2000 to 2017. He is also the co-founder of BH Equity Research and the author of several books, in which he analyzes a variety of topics from an Objectivist perspective.\n\nYaron Brook was born and raised in Israel. His parents were Jewish socialists from South Africa. When he was sixteen, a friend lent him a copy of Ayn Rand's \"Atlas Shrugged\", leading him to abandon the socialism taught to him by his parents and to embrace Objectivism. After graduating from high school, he served as a first sergeant in Israeli military intelligence (1979–1982) and then earned a Bachelor of Science in civil engineering in 1986 from the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa. In 1987, he moved to the United States, where he received his Master of Business Administration in 1989 and PhD in finance in 1994 from the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nBrook began his career as a finance professor at the Leavey School of Business at Santa Clara University, a position he held for seven years and which won him awards of recognition.\n\nIn 1998, he co-founded a financial advisory firm with Robert Hendershott, BH Equity Research, where he continues today as managing director and chairman.\n\nBrook became an associate of leading Objectivist intellectuals, such as philosopher Leonard Peikoff, and in 1994, he co-founded Lyceum International, a company that organized Objectivist conferences and offered distance-learning courses. In 2000, he left Santa Clara University to succeed Michael Berliner as President and Executive Director of the Ayn Rand Institute, which was then located in Marina del Rey, California. In 2002, ARI relocated to Irvine, California.\n\nBrook's philosophical activism includes teaching and public lecturing at events and conferences held predominantly in North America, speaking and debating at numerous American universities, delivering seminars for businesses and corporations in the United States and abroad, and writing opinion editorials for leading newspapers and websites. Speaking venues also include conferences, and professional and community groups. His subjects span a wide range of current events and philosophical issues, including: the causes of the financial crisis, the morality of capitalism, and ending the growth of the state, each discussed with Objectivism at its foundation. In recent years, he has spoken to audiences throughout the world, including those in China, Australia, Brazil, Argentina, Greece, Iceland, Bulgaria, Israel, Guatemala, and England.\n\nBrook is a columnist for \"Forbes\", and his articles have been featured in \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"USA Today\", \"Investor's Business Daily\", and many other publications. A frequent guest on a variety of radio and national television programs, he is the co-author of \"Neoconservatism: An Obituary for an Idea\" and \"Free Market Revolution: How Ayn Rand's Ideas Can End Big Government\", and contributing author of \"Winning the Unwinnable War: America's Self-Crippled Response to Islamic Totalitarianism.\" His newest book is \"Equal Is Unfair: America's Misguided Fight Against Income Inequality,\" co-authored with Don Watkins.\n\nBrook promotes the Objectivist ethical position that rational selfishness is a moral virtue and that altruism is evil. In addition to teaching classes on his moral view of self-interest at ARI and as a guest lecturer at Brown University, Brook also defended the egoist position in a 2006 debate with former US Senator Robert Krueger at Texas State University, San Marcos.\n\nBrook is an outspoken proponent of \"laissez-faire\" capitalism. In appearances on CNBC and in several articles and speeches, he has defended the rights of corporations and businessmen and upheld the virtues of capitalism. In a January 7, 2007 editorial in \"USA Today\", he defended multimillion-dollar CEO pay packages against the attempt by government to regulate them. In a 2010 interview, Brook called the efforts of Democrats to raise taxes on multi-millionaires \"totally immoral.\" He criticized George W. Bush for signing the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which regulates corporate accounting practices. He has also argued that antitrust laws are \"unjust and make no sense ethically or economically.\"\n\nOn gun rights, Brook has stated, \"The government certainly has a role in regulating ownership of weapons\", but he states that it is a \"complex\" issue to do with the philosophy of law. He is inclined to draw the line of prohibition between \"offensive\" weapons, such as tanks and weapons of mass destruction, and \"defensive\" weapons.\n\nBrook has stated that he does not believe regulation has any role to play in protecting the environment and believes human-originated climate change to be a doomsday scenario propagated by environmentalists. He has indicated that as an ideological iteration it goes back decades, and that he believes global warming is \"another in a line of failed scare stories,\" with preferential funding given to researchers promoting it. Drawing a comparison between the role played by low quality housing and infrastructure in the 2010 Haiti earthquake and the contrasting resilience of more developed countries, he suggests the solution to supposed environmental changes is \"laissez-faire\" capitalism and the resultant rise in standard of living.\n\nBrook has gained much attention for his application of Objectivist moral philosophy to the question of American foreign policy, particularly on the Middle East.\n\nHe advocates an American foreign policy of rational self-interest that would serve only to protect the rights of Americans, as opposed to any form of government monetary aid, state-building, or spreading democracy. He has criticized the foreign policy of Ron Paul and other libertarians.\n\nHe advocates the withdrawal of US troops from Europe, and US withdrawal from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the United Nations, calling the latter \"one of the most immoral institutions ever created by man\". He is ambivalent about the World Trade Organization.\n\nBrook calls for an embargo on North Korea, denouncing the regime as \"threatening\" and \"belligerent\", but believes that war is not necessary at present.\n\nBrook argues that Islamic terrorists initiated a war against the West because they hate its culture, wealth, love of life, and global influence, and that they attack Israel because of the influence Western culture has had on it. He explicitly rejects the idea that Islamic terrorists attack Western nations because they support Israel or because of any other reason, such as poverty or retaliation.\n\nBrook claims that the West is not at war with terrorism but the ideology of Islamic totalitarianism. He repeatedly says that just like in World War II, the US wasn't at war against Japanese Kamikaze pilots or German tanks, but the ideas of Nazism and Japanese Imperialism.\n\nBrook claims that Islamic totalitarians are Muslims who wish to dictate every part of life from the teachings of Islam, taken to its logical extreme. He believes Islamic totalitarians want to organize their governments according to Islam, and that they wish to spread a global Islamic government across the world, sometimes using legitimate means, but mainly by using physical force, i.e. terrorism. Brook claims that the Islamic totalitarians repeatedly express this openly, arguing:\n\n... it is a movement that believes in conquest ... Islam should rule every aspect of one's life ... they don't believe in separation of religion and state ... and those who disagree are second class citizens or worthy of death, they want an empire in middle east, but their goal ultimately is world domination, and they state this. They are never satisfied with oppressing their own people or the people around them, they want world domination.\n\nBrook has done a fair amount of work to formulate a unique morality of war, although originated by Ayn Rand and also advocated by other Objectivists like Leonard Peikoff, Onkar Ghate, and Craig Biddle.\n\nBrook claims that when the US goes to war, it should only be to protect the rights of its people, and the government must do everything in its power to end the threat to its citizens, as soon as possible, by using overwhelming military force (or the threat of force). If torturing enemy POWs and purposely targeting civilian population centers will end a war against American citizens, Brook is for it. The specific goal of this total war would be to crush the will of the people who started the war against the United States. After the government of the enemy country is destroyed, the United States should leave unless there is a special circumstance in which the people of the defeated country are realistically willing to adopt Western-style governments.\n\nIn his article \"'Just War Theory' vs. American Self-Defense,\" co-authored with Alex Epstein in \"The Objective Standard\", Brook writes:\n\nWithout physical and spiritual support by these states, the Islamic Totalitarian cause would be a hopeless, discredited one, with few if any willing to kill in its name. Thus, the first order of business in a proper response to 9/11 would have been to end state support of Islamic Totalitarianism—including ending the Iranian regime that is its fatherland.\n\nBrook further argues that these Islamic states must be severely attacked in order to crush their will to engage in and support terrorism.\n\nThe US has been attacked first thus it has the \"moral right\" to fight Islamism. The sole moral duty of the United States is to defend its citizens against its enemies by all means, even with the use of the atom bomb if necessary.\n\nWhat specific military actions would have been required post-9/11 to end state support of Islamic Totalitarianism is a question for specialists in military strategy, but even a cursory look at history can tell us one thing for sure: It would have required the willingness to take \"devastating military action against enemy regimes\"—to oust their leaders and prominent supporters, to make examples of certain regimes or cities in order to win the surrender of others, and to inflict suffering on complicit civilian populations, who enable terrorist-supporting regimes to remain in power.\n\nFrom the beginning of the War on Terrorism, Brook has argued that Iran should be the primary target of US retaliation for Sept. 11, secondary targets being Saudi Arabia and Syria.\n\nHe is for waging war on Islamic totalitarian states, but he believes that Bush's \"Forward Strategy of Freedom\" is altruistic, self-defeating, and in opposition to America's national self-interest.\n\nIn his 2006 speech \"Democracy vs. Victory: Why the 'Forward Strategy of Freedom' Had to Fail\" given at the Ford Hall Forum in Boston he said:\n\nOn December 17, 2004, Yaron Brook appeared on The O'Reilly Factor, Impact Segment, \"Aftermath of Fallujah activities\", the context was that an embedded journalist had reported about the shooting of previously disarmed Iraqi soldiers in Fallujah. During this interview he said:\n\nI'm suggesting that we start bringing this war to the civilians, the consequences of this war, to the civilians who are harboring and helping and supporting the insurgents in Fallujah and other places. ... I would like to see the United States turn Fallujah into dust, and tell the Iraqis: If you're going to continue to support the insurgents you will not have homes, you will not have schools, you will not have mosques ...\n\nBrook argued that if \"flattening Fallujah to end the Iraqi insurgency will save American lives, to refrain from [doing so] is morally evil.\"\n\nBrook considers Israel to be a morally good nation because its Western-style government protects the rights of its citizens, Arab and Jewish alike, vastly more than neighboring countries. On Zionism, Brook argued that \"Zionism fused a valid concern - self-preservation amid a storm of hostility - with a toxic premise - ethnically based collectivism and religion\".\n\nBrook advocates morally, but not necessarily financially, supporting Israel, which he sees as a Western ally against Islamic terrorism.\n\nBrook strongly disagrees with many aspects of Israel's policies, including its collectivist and religious influences, and its 'self-sacrificial' foreign policy of giving its enemies land, money, and other goods.\n\nBrook is married and has two sons, Niv, a comedian, and Edaan.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2111074", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2111074", "title": "Search engine marketing", "text": "Search engine marketing\n\nSearch engine marketing (SEM) is a form of Internet marketing that involves the promotion of websites by increasing their visibility in search engine results pages (SERPs) primarily through paid advertising. SEM may incorporate search engine optimization (SEO), which adjusts or rewrites website content and site architecture to achieve a higher ranking in search engine results pages to enhance pay per click (PPC) listings.\n\nIn 2007, U.S. advertisers spent US $24.6 billion on search engine marketing. In Q2 2015, Google (73.7%) and the Yahoo/Bing (26.3%) partnership accounted for almost 100% of U.S. search engine spend. As of 2006, SEM was growing much faster than traditional advertising and even other channels of online marketing. Managing search campaigns is either done directly with the SEM vendor or through an SEM tool provider. It may also be self-serve or through an advertising agency.\nAs of October 2016, Google leads the global search engine market with a market share of 89.3%. Bing comes second with a market share of 4.36%, Yahoo comes third with a market share of 3.3%, and Chinese search engine Baidu is fourth globally with a share of about 0.68%.\n\nAs the number of sites on the Web increased in the mid-to-late 1990s, search engines started appearing to help people find information quickly. Search engines developed business models to finance their services, such as pay per click programs offered by Open Text in 1996 and then Goto.com in 1998. Goto.com later changed its name to Overture in 2001, was purchased by Yahoo! in 2003, and now offers paid search opportunities for advertisers through Yahoo! Search Marketing. Google also began to offer advertisements on search results pages in 2000 through the Google AdWords program. By 2007, pay-per-click programs proved to be primary moneymakers for search engines. In a market dominated by Google, in 2009 Yahoo! and Microsoft announced the intention to forge an alliance. The Yahoo! & Microsoft Search Alliance eventually received approval from regulators in the US and Europe in February 2010.\n\nSearch engine optimization consultants expanded their offerings to help businesses learn about and use the advertising opportunities offered by search engines, and new agencies focusing primarily upon marketing and advertising through search engines emerged. The term \"search engine marketing\" was popularized by Danny Sullivan in 2001 to cover the spectrum of activities involved in performing SEO, managing paid listings at the search engines, submitting sites to directories, and developing online marketing strategies for businesses, organizations, and individuals.\n\nSearch engine marketing uses at least five methods and metrics to optimize websites.\n\n\nSearch engine marketing is a way to create and edit a website so that search engines rank it higher than other pages. It should be also focused on keyword marketing or pay-per-click advertising (PPC). The technology enables advertisers to bid on specific keywords or phrases and ensures ads appear with the results of search engines.\n\nWith the development of this system, the price is growing under a high level of competition. Many advertisers prefer to expand their activities, including increasing search engines and adding more keywords. The more advertisers are willing to pay for clicks, the higher the ranking for advertising, which leads to higher traffic. PPC comes at a cost. The higher position is likely to cost $5 for a given keyword, and $4.50 for a third location. A third advertiser earns 10% less than the top advertiser while reducing traffic by 50%. \n\nInvestors must consider their return on investment when engaging in PPC campaigns. Buying traffic via PPC will deliver a positive ROI when the total cost-per-click for a single conversion remains below the profit margin. That way the amount of money spent to generate revenue is below the actual revenue generated. A positive ROI is the outcome.\n\nThere are many reasons explaining why advertisers choose the SEM strategy. First, creating a SEM account is easy and can build traffic quickly based on the degree of competition. The shopper who uses the search engine to find information tends to trust and focus on the links showed in the results pages. However, a large number of online sellers do not buy search engine optimization to obtain higher ranking lists of search results but prefer paid links. A growing number of online publishers are allowing search engines such as Google to crawl content on their pages and place relevant ads on it. From an online seller's point of view, this is an extension of the payment settlement and an additional incentive to invest in paid advertising projects. Therefore, it is virtually impossible for advertisers with limited budgets to maintain the highest rankings in the increasingly competitive search market.\n\nGoogle's search engine marketing is one of the western world's marketing leaders, while its search engine marketing is its biggest source of profit. Google's search engine providers are clearly ahead of the Yahoo and Bing network. The display of unknown search results is free, while advertisers are willing to pay for each click of the ad in the sponsored search results.\n\nPaid inclusion involves a search engine company charging fees for the inclusion of a website in their results pages. Also known as sponsored listings, paid inclusion products are provided by most search engine companies either in the main results area or as a separately identified advertising area.\n\nThe fee structure is both a filter against superfluous submissions and a revenue generator. Typically, the fee covers an annual subscription for one webpage, which will automatically be catalogued on a regular basis. However, some companies are experimenting with non-subscription based fee structures where purchased listings are displayed permanently. A per-click fee may also apply. Each search engine is different. Some sites allow only paid inclusion, although these have had little success. More frequently, many search engines, like Yahoo!, mix paid inclusion (per-page and per-click fee) with results from web crawling. Others, like Google (and as of 2006, Ask.com), do not let webmasters pay to be in their search engine listing (advertisements are shown separately and labeled as such).\n\nSome detractors of paid inclusion allege that it causes searches to return results based more on the economic standing of the interests of a web site, and less on the relevancy of that site to end-users.\n\nOften the line between pay per click advertising and paid inclusion is debatable. Some have lobbied for any paid listings to be labeled as an advertisement, while defenders insist they are not actually ads since the webmasters do not control the content of the listing, its ranking, or even whether it is shown to any users. Another advantage of paid inclusion is that it allows site owners to specify particular schedules for crawling pages. In the general case, one has no control as to when their page will be crawled or added to a search engine index. Paid inclusion proves to be particularly useful for cases where pages are dynamically generated and frequently modified.\n\nPaid inclusion is a search engine marketing method in itself, but also a tool of search engine optimization since experts and firms can test out different approaches to improving ranking and see the results often within a couple of days, instead of waiting weeks or months. Knowledge gained this way can be used to optimize other web pages, without paying the search engine company.\n\nSEM is the wider discipline that incorporates SEO. SEM includes both paid search results (using tools like Google Adwords or Bing Ads, formerly known as Microsoft adCenter) and organic search results (SEO). SEM uses paid advertising with AdWords or Bing Ads, pay per click (particularly beneficial for local providers as it enables potential consumers to contact a company directly with one click), article submissions, advertising and making sure SEO has been done. A keyword analysis is performed for both SEO and SEM, but not necessarily at the same time. SEM and SEO both need to be monitored and updated frequently to reflect evolving best practices.\n\nIn some contexts, the term \"SEM\" is used exclusively to mean \"pay per click advertising\", particularly in the commercial advertising and marketing communities which have a vested interest in this narrow definition. Such usage excludes the wider search marketing community that is engaged in other forms of SEM such as search engine optimization and search retargeting.\n\nCreating the link between SEO and PPC represents an integral part of the SEM concept. Sometimes, especially when separate teams work on SEO and PPC and the efforts are not synced, positive results of aligning their strategies can be lost. The aim of both SEO and PPC is maximizing the visibility in search and thus, their actions to achieve it should be centrally coordinated. Both teams can benefit from setting shared goals and combined metrics, evaluating data together to determine future strategy or discuss which of the tools works better to get the traffic for selected keywords in the national and local search results. Thanks to this, the search visibility can be increased along with optimizing both conversions and costs.\n\nAnother part of SEM is social media marketing (SMM). SMM is a type of marketing that involves exploiting social media to influence consumers that one company’s products and/or services are valuable. \nSome of the latest theoretical advances include search engine marketing management (SEMM). SEMM relates to activities including SEO but focuses on return on investment (ROI) management instead of relevant traffic building (as is the case of mainstream SEO). SEMM also integrates organic SEO, trying to achieve top ranking without using paid means to achieve it, and pay per click SEO. For example, some of the attention is placed on the web page layout design and how content and information is displayed to the website visitor. SEO & SEM are two pillars of one marketing job and they both run side by side to produce much better results than focusing on only one pillar.\n\nPaid search advertising has not been without controversy and the issue of how search engines present advertising on their search result pages has been the target of a series of studies and reports by \"Consumer Reports\" WebWatch. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) also issued a letter in 2002 about the importance of disclosure of paid advertising on search engines, in response to a complaint from Commercial Alert, a consumer advocacy group with ties to Ralph Nader.\n\nAnother ethical controversy associated with search marketing has been the issue of trademark infringement. The debate as to whether third parties should have the right to bid on their competitors' brand names has been underway for years. In 2009 Google changed their policy, which formerly prohibited these tactics, allowing 3rd parties to bid on branded terms as long as their landing page in fact provides information on the trademarked term. Though the policy has been changed this continues to be a source of heated debate.\n\nOn April 24, 2012, many started to see that Google has started to penalize companies that are buying links for the purpose of passing off the rank. The Google Update was called Penguin. Since then, there have been several different Penguin/Panda updates rolled out by Google. SEM has, however, nothing to do with link buying and focuses on organic SEO and PPC management. As of October 20, 2014, Google had released three official revisions of their Penguin Update.\n\nIn 2013, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals held in \"Lens.com, Inc. v. 1-800 Contacts, Inc.\" that online contact lens seller Lens.com did not commit trademark infringement when it purchased search advertisements using competitor 1-800 Contacts' federally registered 1800 CONTACTS trademark as a keyword. In August 2016, the Federal Trade Commission filed an administrative complaint against 1-800 Contacts alleging, among other things, that its trademark enforcement practices in the search engine marketing space have unreasonably restrained competition in violation of the FTC Act. 1-800 Contacts has denied all wrongdoing and appeared before an FTC administrative law judge in April 2017.\n\nAdWords is recognized as a web-based advertising utensil since it adopts keywords that can deliver adverts explicitly to web users looking for information in respect to a certain product or service. It is flexible and provides customizable options like Ad Extensions, access to non-search sites, leveraging the display network to help increase brand awareness. The project hinges on cost per click (CPC) pricing where the maximum cost per day for the campaign can be chosen, thus the payment of the service only applies if the advert has been clicked. SEM companies have embarked on AdWords projects as a way to publicize their SEM and SEO services. One of the most successful approaches to the strategy of this project was to focus on making sure that PPC advertising funds were prudently invested. Moreover, SEM companies have described AdWords as a practical tool for increasing a consumer’s investment earnings on Internet advertising. The use of conversion tracking and Google Analytics tools was deemed to be practical for presenting to clients the performance of their canvas from click to conversion. AdWords project has enabled SEM companies to train their clients on the utensil and delivers better performance to the canvass. The assistance of AdWord canvass could contribute to the growth of web traffic for a number of its consumer’s websites, by as much as 250% in only nine months.\n\nAnother way search engine marketing is managed is by contextual advertising. Here marketers place ads on other sites or portals that carry information relevant to their products so that the ads jump into the circle of vision of browsers who are seeking information from those sites. A successful SEM plan is the approach to capture the relationships amongst information searchers, businesses, and search engines. Search engines were not important to some industries in the past, but over the past years the use of search engines for accessing information has become vital to increase business opportunities. The use of SEM strategic tools for businesses such as tourism can attract potential consumers to view their products, but it could also pose various challenges. These challenges could be the competition that companies face amongst their industry and other sources of information that could draw the attention of online consumers. To assist the combat of challenges, the main objective for businesses applying SEM is to improve and maintain their ranking as high as possible on SERPs so that they can gain visibility. Therefore, search engines are adjusting and developing algorithms and the shifting criteria by which web pages are ranked sequentially to combat against search engine misuse and spamming, and to supply the most relevant information to searchers. This could enhance the relationship amongst information searchers, businesses, and search engines by understanding the strategies of marketing to attract business.\n\n"}

Brought up in a Mennonite family, he first learned the trumpet and by age 13 was engaged with his local chapter of The Salvation Army. Gospel music and rock, combined with a broad interest in music made him record three albums with the band within 10 years. These were successful in Germany and included 1979's \"Leaving LA\" which reached No. 56 on \"Billboard\". In 1984, he launched his solo career, which culminated in four projects with a string of chart-topping hits from each album. The first solo album recorded at Greenhouse Studios in Vancouver would achieve gold record status in Canada. In 1986, Michael Godin, who was vice president of A&R with A&M Records Canada, left to become the Janz's manager. The success of his projects led to his nomination for the Juno Awards, Canada's most prominent music award. Despite achieving great success in Canada, his U.S. record label's restructuring of its roster of artists led to the end of promotion in the American market. Janz's final project, \"Trust\", which was recorded under a co-partnership with the Attic Records label, continued the same ground-breaking tradition with Janz's trademark lyrical compositions and driving melodic rhythms. Since that time, Janz hasn't released any new material.\n\nIn 1981 he took part in the German selection for the Eurovision Song Contest with the song \"\"Steine\" (Stones)\". He finished tenth behind musicians like Taco and Peter Cornelius. Instead, Lena Valaitis was selected to represent Germany at the Eurovision Song Contest 1981 with the song \"Johnny Blue\". The song has also been recorded in English with his band Deliverance, a longer version titled \"Last Road to Forever\".\n\nIn 1989 \"Songwriter\" was released, an album distributed by the publisher, Irving Music of Canada, to promote Janz's songs to other artists and producers, not intended for commercial release.\n\nPrior to retiring, he was the Professor Emeritus of Philosophical Theology and Head of the Department of Theology and Religious Studies at King's College London. He formerly taught philosophy at Trinity Western University in Langley, British Columbia and has written a book entitled \"God, the Mind's Desire: Reference, Reason and Christian Thinking\" published by Cambridge University Press. In 2004, Janz's first album \"High Strung\" was re-released on CD for the first time by Escape Music in the UK. More recently, he has launched a new brand, Transformation Theology, a re-make of Bonhoeffer's grass-root theology.\n\nHis son Chris Janz was a recording artist and GMA Canada Covenant Award winning songwriter and Covenant Award-nominated producer.

However, there is no specific source about the number of JSL users because of the difficulty in distinguishing who are JSL users and who use other kinds of sign, like Taiou Shuwa and Chuukan Shuwa. According to the Japanese Association for Sign Language Studies, the estimated number of JSL users is around 60,000 in Japan.\n\nLittle is known about sign language and the deaf community before the Edo period. In 1862, the Tokugawa shogunate dispatched envoys to various European schools for the deaf but the first school for the deaf was not established until 1878 in Kyōto.\n\nUntil 1948, deaf children were not required to attend school or to receive a formal education.\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, a subtle cultural change in views about the Deaf in Japan evolved. The long-standing concept that \"deaf\" only means \"people who can't hear\" emphasized a physical impairment as part of a biomedical disease model; however, this was gradually replaced by a slightly different paradigm. \"Deaf people\" were more often identified as \"people who use Japanese sign language\". In other words, the biomedical disability model began slowly to be displaced by a social-cultural or JSL paradigm.\n\nThe Japanese Federation of the Deaf has worked with slow success in efforts to enhance communication opportunities for Japanese whose primary language is JSL.\n\nThe changing status of JSL and the Deaf in Japan is a slow process; but there are highlights. For example, JSL has an advocate among the Imperial family. Kiko, Princess Akishino has studied JSL and is a trained sign language interpreter. She attends the Sign Language Speech Contest for High School Students held every August, and Praising Mothers Raising Children with Hearing Impairments every December. In October 2008, she participated in the 38th National Deaf Women's Conference. She also signs in informal Deaf gatherings.\n\nThe Deaf community supported passage of the proposed Sign Language Law. The \"Basic Act for Persons with Disabilities\" was enacted in 2011. This law recognized sign language as a language.\n\nThe slow integration of JSL within the context of Japanese culture has been accompanied by an expansion of the numbers of sign language interpreters:\n\nIn 2006, the Japanese government amended the Supporting Independence of People with Disabilities Act. The new language in the law encourages local governments to increase the number and use of JSL interpreters.\n\nJapanese Sign Language is often confused with other Manually coded language for communicating that are used in Japan. Japanese Sign Language is a naturally evolved language, and like any other language has its own linguistic structures. Manual systems for expressing a spoken language often lead to ungrammatical structures and incomplete sentences in both the spoken and signed language. In Japan, there are three kinds of sign terms:\nA sign language among the sign terms is only JSL. However, those three kinds of sign terms are called “Shuwa (sign)” widely in Japan.\n\nThe sign languages of Korea and Taiwan share some signs with JSL, perhaps due to cultural transfer during the period of Japanese occupation. JSL has about a 60% lexical similarity with Taiwanese Sign Language.\n\nThe confliction about the definition of JSL and Taiou Shuwa continues, and it affects Deaf education. In the 1990s, the long term of oral education was converted to the total communication method. Previously, Deaf children were forced to speak and banned from using sign language in all schools for the Deaf. With the total communication method, teachers use every communication tool, including spoken language, written language, and simultaneous communication, to fit each Deaf child. Also, sign spread in Japan at that time, but the sign was used along with speaking, called Taiou Shuwa.In 2003, the Japan Deaf Children and Parents Association published a civil rights remedy statement called “Rights of Deaf children to education equality were infringed”. They requested teachers who can teach JSL in all schools, and they demanded the JSL cambism class for the all universities give a license for teachers of the Deaf. However, the Japanese Federation of the Deaf said “human rights may be infringed by distinguishing the two communication methods for users of JSL and Taiou Shuwa,” with some agreement from the Japan Deaf Children and Parents Association. Finally, the Japan Federation of Bar Associations prepared “Opinion to require enriched sign education,” and they used the word “sign” instead of JSL. The statement did not have the power of adding the mention that teachers can teach in JSL in all schools for the Deaf.Currently, JSL is used in only one private school in Tokyo, Meisei Gakuen, and the other schools for the Deaf use other communication methods.\n\nBilingual Education for Deaf aims to acquire JSL and written language. Some parents select other modality of language as well with sign language, like spoken language, to communicate with their children. Some parents also select to use other tools, cochlear implants and hearing aids, for their Deaf children with sign language. In regards to the Deaf education, using sign was cited in studies as it prevents from acquiring written language for a long time. However, recent articles reported that the children who have fluent first language have the ability to acquire second language, like other foreign language learners, even though the modalities are different. Therefore, the most important thing is to acquire fluency in the first language. The future task is to think about how to make the bridge between Japanese sign language and written language in bilingual education. In Japan, the bilingual education has been in free school (Tatsunoko Gakuen) since 1999 and school (Meisei Gakuen) since 2009.\n\nIn 2011, the first sign law was established on “language” as an act for persons with disabilities on July 29th, and it was announced on Aug 5th. After this, sign was enacted and acknowledged as a form of language by law in Japan. In 2013, the first sign language law was established in Tottori Prefecture. “Sign is language”, the law was written. From then on, sign law was spread all over Japan in the scale of prefecture. Currently, there are aims to establish sign language law at the national level. However, there are two conflictive positions about the sign law. Those sign laws were not written as JSL. One position claimed that it is dangerous to mislead that sign language includes not only JSL, but also Taiou Shuwa (Mannually coded Japanese or simultaneous communication), Chuukan Shuwa (Contact Sign). The other claimed that by establishing JSL language law makes it easy to discriminate many various sign users.\n\nInterest in sign language among the hearing population of Japan has been increasing, with numerous books now published targeting the hearing population, a weekly TV program teaching JSL, and the increasing availability of night school classes for the hearing to learn JSL. There have been several TV dramas, including \"Hoshi no Kinka\" (1995), in which signing has been a significant part of the plot, and sign language dramas are now a minor genre on Japanese TV.\n\nThe highly acclaimed 2006 film \"Babel\", which was directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu and nominated for multiple Academy Awards, also featured JSL as a significant element of the plot. Hearing actress Rinko Kikuchi received a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her signing role in this film.\n\nIn Japan, about 40,000 signatures including both the hearing and deaf people were collected to subtitle the scene in Babel spoken in Japanese for the deaf audience.\n\nThe anime school drama film \"A Silent Voice\" (Japanese: 聲の形 Hepburn: Koe no Katachi, lit. \"The Shape of Voice\"), released in 2016, features a prominent deaf JSL-speaking character, Shōko Nishimiya. It was produced by Kyoto Animation, directed by Naoko Yamada, written by Reiko Yoshida, and featured character designs by Futoshi Nishiya. It is based on the manga of the same name written and illustrated by Yoshitoki Ōima. The film premiered in Japan on September 17, 2016.\n\nAs in other sign languages, JSL (usually called simply 手話 \"shuwa\", \"hand talk\") consists of words, or signs, and the grammar with which they are put together. JSL signs may be nouns, verbs, adjectives, or any other part of a sentence, including suffixes indicating tense, negation, and grammatical particles. Signs consist not just of a manual gesture, but also (pronouncing a standard Japanese word with or without making a sound). The same sign may assume one of two different but semantically related meanings, as for example in \"home\" and \"house\", according to its mouthing. Another indispensable part of many signs is facial expression.\nIn addition to signs and their grammar, JSL is augmented by , a form of fingerspelling, which was introduced from the United States in the early part of the twentieth century, but is used less often than in American Sign Language. Each \"yubimoji\" corresponds to a \"kana\", as illustrated by the JSL syllabary. Fingerspelling is used mostly for foreign words, last names, and unusual words. is used to cover situations where existing signs are not sufficient.\n\nBecause JSL is strongly influenced by the complex Japanese writing system, it dedicates particular attention to the written language and includes elements specifically designed to express \"kanji\" in signs. For either conciseness or disambiguation, particular signs are associated with certain commonly used \"kanji\", place names, and sometimes surnames. (tracing \"kanji\" in the air) is also sometimes used for last names or place names, just as it is in spoken Japanese.\n\n\n\n"}

His primary aim through his writing was to entertain by transforming his personal experiences into literary works of art. He was never connected to any one literary movement but he did utilize the precepts of naturalism, Neo-Romanticism, Expressionism, and the Freudian psychoanalytical concepts, but only as long as they suited his desires. “By fusing the realistic narrative and stage tradition of Hungary with Western influences into a cosmopolitan amalgam, Molnár emerged as a versatile artist whose style was uniquely his own.” As a novelist, Molnár may best be remembered for \"The Paul Street Boys\", the story of two rival gangs of youths in Budapest. It has been translated into fourteen languages and adapted for the stage and film. It has been considered a masterpiece by many. It was, however, as a playwright that he made his greatest contribution and how he is best known internationally. \"In his graceful, whimsical, sophisticated drawing-room comedies, he provided a felicitous synthesis of naturalism]] and fantasy, realism and romanticism, cynicism and sentimentality, the profane and the sublime.\" Out of his many plays, \"The Devil\", \"Liliom\", \"The Swan\", \"The Guardsman\" and \"The Play's the Thing\" endure as classics. He was influenced by the likes of Oscar Wilde, George Bernard Shaw, and Gerhart Hauptmann. He immigrated to the United States to escape persecution of Hungarian Jews during World War II and later adopted American citizenship. Molnár’s plays continue to be relevant and are performed all over the world. His national and international fame has inspired many Hungarian playwrights including Elemér Boross, László Fodor, Lajos Bíró, , Ernő Vajda, Attila Orbók, and Imre Földes, among others.\n\nFerenc Molnár was born in Budapest on January 12, 1878 to Dr. Mór Neumann, a prosperous and popular gastroenterologist, and Jozefa Wallfisch. The home in which he lived was opulent but gloomy. Even though he was born into wealth, \"It was not a friendly atmosphere for the lively and precocious Ferenc, who constantly had to be warned to keep quiet.\" Just a year before his birth, his parent's first born son and Molnár's brother, László, died. His mother was frail and frequently bedridden. Illness spread throughout the rooms of his house, and young Ferenc constantly was being told to keep quiet. In 1887, Molnár entered the Református Gimnázium, a secondary school (high school) located in Miskolc, Hungary, where he was inspired to learn foreign languages and where his talent as a writer began to take shape. At the age of 14, he started a periodical titled \"Haladás\" (Progress) which sold only four copies and a secondary publication titled \"É letképek\" (Panorama) selling only 20 copies. His first dramatic work was \"Kék barlang\" (Blue Cave), a controversial play written, directed, and staged in the basement of a friend's house. Upon completing secondary school, Molnár studied law at the University of Budapest in 1895, and shortly thereafter, he was sent to Geneva by his father to continue his studies at the Swiss University. While living in Geneva, he began writing frequently, often sending his work to various papers. Molnár also wrote the short novella \"Magdolna\" during this time. He also traveled to Paris to see some of the popular new plays. \"The fashionable boulevard comedies of Bernstein, Bataille, Capus, and others left a deep impression on him and later greatly influenced his dramatic style.\" In 1896, he abandoned a legal career to pursue a full-time career as a journalist. He covered a variety of topics during his time as a journalist, but his primary focus was the court trials for \"Vészi's Budapesti Napló (\"Budapest Daily), a newspaper then edited and published by József Vészi, a Jewish intellectual who dominated Hungarian political journalism. Molnár's first wife was one of Vészi's daughters (Margit Vészi). His mother died in 1898 when Ferenc was 20 years of age. Molnár served as a proud and jingoistic supporter of the Austro-Hungarian Empire while working as a war correspondent during World War I. So positive were his war reports that he was decorated by the Habsburg emperor, but criticized by some of his pacifist peers. He later wrote \"Reflections of a War Correspondent\", describing his experiences. \n\nIn 1901, Molnár published his first full-length novel \"Az éhes város\" (The Hungry City). This novel made Molnár's name familiar throughout Hungary. It was \"a relentless exposé of the evil effect of money, viewed by a young, idealistic newspaperman.\" The year following the release of \"Az éhes város,\" Molnár began writing for the theatre. It was in this medium that he became known internationally. His early works as a playwright were influenced by his journalistic work. Molnár's first play, \"A doctor úr\" (The Lawyer), and the play that followed, \"Józsi\", are both comedies that were essentially a dramatization of newspaper sketches about a spoiled rich child and published as a collection of short dialogues. His personal life inspired a lot of his writing. After his separation from his first wife (Margit Vészi), he became involved with the famous Hungarian actress Irén Szécsi, who was married to a wealthy manufacturer at the time. Some of his more critically successful works were influenced by this affair. In 1907, Molnár wrote \"Az ördög\" (The Devil) for Irén, in which he challenged her to leave her husband. It brought Molnár international fame and was performed all over Europe and In New York. \"The Devil\" later was adapted into a film by the Hungarian-born American director Michael Curtiz and three years later into an English language version directed by James Young. Also in 1907, Molnár wrote three books including his juvenile novel \"A Pál-utcai Fiúk\" (The Paul Street Boys). \"His fame reached its height with the successful performances of \"Liliom\" abroad, though the play initially had been a failure in Budapest.\" It became his best-known play and later was adapted into the musical \"Carousel\" by the songwriting team of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II. Molnár sought to regain favor with his wife Lili by portraying her in the role of Juli, and then through his plays \"The Guardsman\" and \"The Wolf\", preceded to explain the complexities of his affair with Irén. \"The Guardsman\" was published in 1910 and served as the basis of the 1931 film of the same name, starring American power couple Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne. Molnár fell into a deep depression after Irén cut off the affair and returned to her family. He resorted to drinking heavily as a result, and in 1911, attempted suicide. He was rehabilitated in Austria and during this dark time continued writing. Between 1910 and 1914, five volumes of his collected essays were published as well as his translations of over 30 French plays. \"Molnár's long and turbulent life was one of hard and incessant work. For over 50 years, he transposed his inner conflict in his literary work; writing was his oxygen, elixir, and self-therapy.\" \n\nOn January 12, 1940, Molnár relocated to America and spent the final 12 years of his life living in Room 835 at New York's Plaza Hotel. In 1943, he suffered a massive heart attack which forced him to suspend work for just short of a year to rest. To celebrate the end of World War II, Molnár wrote and published \"Isten veled szivem\" (Farewell My Heart) and the English Edition of \"The Captain of St Margaret's.\" Molnár became depressed after learning the fate of his Jewish friends and colleagues after the war. He was outraged and depressed, and his personality changed as a result. He became apathetic, morose, and misanthropic. In 1947, Molnár experienced a devastating tragedy: His secretary and devoted companion Wanda Bartha committed suicide. This event had a lasting effect on Molnár. Upon her death, he wrote \"Companion in Exile\", his most tragic work, recalling his friend's sacrifices and the times they had spent together. Monár donated all his manuscripts and bound scrapbooks containing articles about him, and prepared by Wanda Bartha, to the New York Public Library. Molnár died of cancer, aged 74, at the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City on April 1, 1952. Because of his superstitious fear that creating a will would hasten his death, Molnár left several manuscripts and unfinished work and a significant amount of money behind. His funeral was attended by only his wife, Lili Darvas, and a few close friends. In the name of all women Molnár had loved, Lili Darvas bid him farewell with a quotation: \"Liliom, sleep my boy, sleep!\"\n\n\n\n"}

San Juan de Lurigancho is bordered by Comas, Independencia and Rímac on the west; and Lurigancho on the east. The Rímac River marks the district's border with downtown Lima and El Agustino on the south.\n\nThe most important urban areas in the district are \"Mangomarca\", \"Zárate\", \"Las Flores de Lima\", \"Canto Grande\" and \"Bayovar\". One of the first urban areas in San Juan de Lurigancho is \"Caja de Agua\", which is located at the entrance of the district. Caja de Agua is surrounded by San Cristobal (south side) and the Santa Rosa hills from south to west and by Gramal hill on the north side. The Próceres de la Independencia Avenue separates Caja de Agua from Zárate. Caja de Agua is the seat of the Police Station located in Avenida Lima. A large and convenient market is found in Avenida Lima; \"Mercado Modelo de Caja de Agua\" which offers value for money products. Another market is \"El Bosque\".

It is formed by the joining of two freshwater rivers, Gunpowder Falls (often referred to locally as \"Big Gunpowder Falls\") and Little Gunpowder Falls.\n\nThe Big Gunpowder, long, begins in the extreme southern part of Pennsylvania's York County. From there, the Gunpowder flows in a generally southeast direction through the length of Baltimore County past the Perry Hall Mansion and the site of its former plantation until it reaches Joppatowne where it is joined by the Little Gunpowder and the Bird River, becoming simply the \"Gunpowder River\" once it passes the Amtrak train bridge that runs from Chase to Joppatowne. The nearby site of old Joppa was an important deep-water seaport and rival to the port of Baltimore in colonial American times, until sedimentation of the Gunpowder River caused by upstream development made its harbor inaccessible to large ships.\n\nLittle Gunpowder Falls, as its name implies, is much smaller than the mainstem Gunpowder Falls. Throughout its length, it forms much of the boundary between eastern Baltimore County and western Harford County until it reaches the Big Gunpowder. The headquarters of the Gunpowder Falls State Park is located in Harford County along the bank of the Little Gunpowder Falls, in the historic Jerusalem Mill Village. The remainder of the boundary between Baltimore and Harford counties is formed by the Gunpowder River, the tidal estuary of the Chesapeake Bay formed by the union of Little Gunpowder Falls and the Gunpowder Falls rivers.\n\nBoth the Gunpowder and Little Gunpowder Falls flow through hilly agricultural and forest land for much of their length. In fact, there are no less than four separate state parks that form Gunpowder Falls State Park, the largest state park in Maryland. At two points, Gunpowder Falls is dammed to form major reservoirs for the Baltimore metropolitan area: Prettyboy Reservoir and Loch Raven Reservoir. By the time the Gunpowder reaches the Bay, however, it is no longer a rural river, but a suburban river that passes under Interstate 95 and many bedroom communities for Baltimore. Nonetheless, Gunpowder State Park on the Chesapeake Bay may give one the impression that this is still a somewhat remote river.\n\nBoth streams flow over the Fall Line separating the Piedmont Plateau from the Atlantic Coastal Plain just downstream of US Route 1.

{"id": "2111156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2111156", "title": "Pinafore", "text": "Pinafore\n\nA pinafore (colloquially a pinny in British English) is a sleeveless garment worn as an apron.\n\nPinafores may be worn as a decorative garment and as a protective apron. A related term is \"pinafore dress\" (known as a \"jumper\" in American English), i.e. a sleeveless dress intended to be worn over a top or blouse. A key difference between a pinafore and a jumper dress is that the pinafore is open in the back. In informal British usage, however, a pinafore dress is sometimes referred to as simply a pinafore, which can lead to confusion. Nevertheless, this has led some authors to use the term \"pinafore apron\", although this is redundant as pinafore alone implies an apron.\n\nThe name reflects the fact that the pinafore was formerly pinned (pin) to the front (afore) of a dress. The pinafore had no buttons and was simply \"pinned on the front\".\n\nPinafores are often confused with smocks. Some languages do not differentiate between these different garments. The pinafore differs from a smock in that it does not have sleeves and there is no back to the bodice. Smocks have both sleeves and a full bodice, both front and back.\n\nA pinafore is a full apron with two holes for the arms that is tied or buttoned in the back, usually just below the neck. Pinafores have complete front shaped over shoulder while aprons usually have no bib, or only a smaller one. A child's garment to wear at school or for play would be a pinafore. More recently, other types of full or dress-like aprons are also occasionally referred to as pinafores. In particular, this is the case for an apron with a full skirt, bib and criss-cross shoulder straps.\n\nFurther confusion results from some foreign languages, which, unlike English, do not have a distinctive term for the pinafore. In German, for example, there is no precise term for pinafore. \"Schürze\" means \"apron\" and thus \"Kinderschürze\" is used to describe a child's apron or pinafore (in contrast to the German word \"Kittelschürze\", which refers to an adult garment, typically worn by older women for housework tasks and cleaning).\n\nIn modern times, the term \"pinny\" or \"pinnie\" has taken another meaning in sports wear, namely a training tabard or scrimmage vest, double-sided short apron, often made of mesh, used to differentiate teams. This usage is chiefly British, with some usage in Canada and the United States. Tabards are also used by large retail stores to indicate employees.\n\nThe pinafore was a type of apron that was pinned over the dress and easily removed for washing. Buttons were frequently damaged by lye soap, which was one reason why dresses were not laundered very often.\n\n\n"}

A circular lip under one disc fits into a groove on the top of the other, holding them fast until a certain amount of force is applied. Different types of snaps can be attached to fabric or leather by riveting with a punch and die set specific to the type of rivet snaps used (striking the punch with a hammer to splay the tail), sewing, or plying with special snap pliers.\n\nSnap fasteners are a noted detail in American Western wear and are also often chosen for children's clothing, as they are relatively easy for children to use compared with traditional buttons.\n\nModern snap fasteners were first patented by German inventor Heribert Bauer in 1885 as the \"Federknopf-Verschluss\", a novelty fastener for men's trousers. Some attribute the invention to Bertel Sanders, of Denmark. In 1886, Albert-Pierre Raymond, of Grenoble, also obtained a patent. These first versions had an S-shaped spring in the \"male\" disc instead of a groove. Australian inventor Myra Juliet Farrell is also credited with inventing a \"stitchless press stud\" and the \"stitchless hook and eye\". In America, Jack Weil (1901–2008) put snaps on his iconic Western shirts, which spread the fashion for them. The Prym company has produced snap fasteners since 1903.\n\nPress studs were worn by rodeo cowboys from the 1930s onwards, because these could be quickly removed if, in the event of a fall, the shirt became snagged in the saddle. Pearl snaps entered American mainstream Western fashion during the 1950s, when singing cowboys like Gene Autry and Roy Rogers incorporated them into their embroidered and fringed stage shirts. The most desirable shirts were unique creations tailored by Nudie Cohn or Rodeo Ben, but commercially produced Western clothing could be purchased from companies like Wrangler, Levi Strauss, Panhandle Slim, Rockmount Ranch Wear, H Bar C, or Roper.\n\nDue to the popularity of Spaghetti Westerns, cowboy shirts with oversized collars were widely worn by teenagers and young adults from the mid 1960s until the early 1980s. By the 1990s, however, press studs had become associated with the adaptable clothing worn by pensioners and the disabled. During the late 2000s and 2010s, shirts with Western detailing made a comeback in Europe and the southern US due to the popularity of indie rock and a resurgence of interest in vintage Americana.\n"}
{"id": "2111171", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2111171", "title": "Fiber cement siding", "text": "Fiber cement siding\n\nFiber cement siding (\"fibre cement cladding\" in the UK and \"fibro\" in Australia) is a building material used to cover the exterior of a building in both commercial and domestic applications. Fiber cement is a composite material made of cement reinforced with cellulose fibers. Originally, asbestos was used as the reinforcing material but, due to safety concerns, that was replaced by cellulose in the 1980s. Fiber cement board may come pre-painted or pre-stained or can be done so after its installation.\n\nFiber cement siding has several benefits since it is resistant to termites, does not rot, is impact resistant, and has fireproof properties.\n\nIn appearance fiber cement siding most often consists of overlapping horizontal boards, imitating wooden siding, clapboard and imitation shingles. Fiber cement siding is also manufactured in a sheet form and is used as cladding, it's also commonly used as a soffit / eave lining and as a tile underlays on decks and in bathrooms. Fiber cement siding can also be utilized as a substitute for timber fascias and bargeboards in high fire areas.\n\nSheet sizes vary slightly from manufacturer to manufacturer but generally they range between 2400 – 3000 mm in length and 900 –1200mm in width (600 & 450 mm increments). This manufactured size minimizes on-site wastage as residential floor, wall and roof structures lay structural members at 450 or 600mm centres.\n\nWhen used as siding boards, widths between 130mm and 300mm (5.25 inch to 12 inch) are available. Fiber cement thicknesses vary between 4.5-18mm and also vary in density – the lower density resulting in a fibrous rough edge when cut and the higher density having a cleaner smoother edge when cut.\n\nThermal resistance and sound transmission can vary greatly between fiber cement products. Fiber cement sheet products rate poorly in thermal resistance and sound transmission and separate wall insulation is highly recommended. Generally the thicker and denser the product the better resistance it will have to temperature and sound transmission.\n\nFiber cement cladding is a very heavy product and requires two people to carry the uncut sheets. Thin fiber cement cladding is fragile before installation and must be handled carefully because it is prone to chipping and breakage if improperly handled. Once the product is cut it may again require two people to install – one to hold the sheet flush against studwork and the other to nail the product in place.\n\nCutting fiber cement sheeting:\nSheeting can be cut to size in three ways.\n\nWhen hanging fiber cement sheets, an approximately gap is required between end-joints (cladding seams), later to be filled with caulking made for fiber cement siding. Metal step flashing is required behind overlapping seams to prevent sheathing damage from water. Hot-dipped galvanized roofing nails are used to secure the sheets.\n\nSome caution must be exercised to properly ventilate areas where fiber cement siding (FCS) is being cut; long-term exposure to the silica dust generated during the installation process can cause silicosis.\n\nFiber cement cladding can be painted or stained before or after installation. For areas of exposure, weatherproof paint must be used. Once the product is fixed the joints are usually covered with timber battens and the entire wall surface is painted.\n\nEarly fiber cement panels used asbestos fibers to add strength. Ludwig Hatschek patented asbestos-reinforced fiber cement in Austria in 1901 and named it \"Eternit\", based on the Latin term \"aeternitas\", meaning everlasting. In 1903, Schweizerische Eternit-Werke AG began fabricating the material in the city of Niederurnen in Switzerland. Cellulose-reinforced fiber cement products were introduced 1980s as a safe replacement for the very widely used asbestos cement products manufactured before that time.\n\nThe external cladding products require very little maintenance once installed and painted. The thicker/denser fiber cement products have excellent impact resistance but the thinner less dense products need to be protected from impact. Compared to wooden siding, fiber cement is not susceptible to termites or rot.\n\nFiber cement siding using baseboard materials that have been classified, by accredited laboratories, as Category A according to BS EN 12467: 2004 Fiber-cement flat sheets - Product specification and test methods are sidings which are intended for applications where they may be subject to heat, high moisture and severe frost.\n\nFiber cement cladding is a non-combustible material which is widely used in high bushfire prone areas throughout Australia.\n\nWhile the best possible reaction to Fire Classifications are A1 (construction applications) and A1Fl (flooring applications) respectively, both of which mean \"non-combustible\" according to European standard EN 13501-1: 2007, as classified by a notified laboratory in Europe, some fiber cement boards only come with Fire Classification of A2 (limited combustibility) or even lower classifications, if they are tested at all.\n\nAs mentioned previously, long-term exposure to silica dust generated by cutting fiber cement siding during installation can lead to silicosis and other lung diseases among workers. Researchers at the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) confirmed these findings, showing that many of the silica dust particles are in the respirable fraction, able to penetrate the deepest parts of the lung. Laboratory tests performed by cutting fiber cement siding within an isolated chamber showed that by connecting a regular shop vacuum to a circular saw, exposures to silica dust produced by the cutting can be reduced by 80-90%. Later, NIOSH completed four field surveys where construction workers cut fiber cement siding. Results showed that exposure to silica dust was controlled below the NIOSH Recommended Exposure Limit (REL) for respirable crystalline silica (0.05 mg/m3) when a regular shop vacuum was used.\n\nCompetitors to fiber cement cladding include products made from vinyl, polyvinyl chloride, wood composite products (such as hardboard and Masonite) and aluminum siding\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2111173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2111173", "title": "California State Guard", "text": "California State Guard\n\nThe California State Guard (CSG), formerly known as the California State Military Reserve, is one of three branches of the Active Militia of the California Military Department. The State Guard was formed to provide California with a trained and organized military force in the event of a state security or natural disaster emergency, to augment the California National Guard or when the National Guard is deployed. Its current mission is articulated in California Military & Veteran's Code § 550:\n\n\"... as the Governor may deem necessary to defend and for the security of this State ...\"\n\nFor the 2012–2013 fiscal year, the CASG had 1400 volunteers and its expenditures were $620,000.\n\nThe California State Guard (CSG) is authorized as a state defense force under the provisions of the Title 32, United States Code, Section 109(c) and the California State Military Reserve Act (codified in the California Military and Veterans Code). It is one of five components of the California Military Department and has legal standing as part of California's Active Militia.\n\nThe force consists of citizens or individuals who have begun their naturalization process, who possess a variety of skills; many members are veterans of other branches of the United States Armed Forces as well as former members of the California Army and Air National Guard. All citizens over the age of 18 who are not felons and possess a high school diploma or GED are eligible to apply for membership, although military veterans and those with special skills which materially contribute to the CSG's mission are preferred.\n\nMembers are considered uncompensated state employees, although when called to Emergency State Active Duty (ESAD), they become compensated employees at the same rate as National Guard members of the same rank. Reimbursement may also be provided in limited circumstances for travel, billeting and meals when directly supporting a National Guard mission. \n\nUnlike the Civil Air Patrol or the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary, the CSG is a statutory military entity of the State with each CSG member subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) per CMVC § 560.\n\nFormer members of the military are likely to have a smooth transition into the CSG. If the break in service is long (more than six years), the soldier may need an adjustment period while going through IET (see below) to come up to speed with modern Army and National Guard practices. Any MOS qualifications, ribbons, medals, badges, or awards earned in federal or state national guard service transfer directly; this includes \"combat patches\". Depending on the rank earned and length of time since separation, previously-held rank in those services also transfers.\n\nCSG regulations require all soldiers to attend the Basic Orientation Course (BOC) which consists of basic military customs and courtesies and a general overview of the CSMR, and lasts a few days at most. In addition to this, any soldier entering the CSG in the southern region must attend an Initial Entry Training (IET) course through the 223d Training Support Regiment, Southern Detachment. This is a five-month course where soldiers report to a student chain of command that changes every month. They are given weekly homework and accountability tasks to strengthen unit cohesion and train soldiers on how to interact with the chain of command. Every month roles are switched around and new soldiers are assigned as squad leaders while soldiers completing Echo track (final phase) graduate and are released to their gaining units. During this five-month course they report for UTA at the Training Company IEP (Initial Entry Platoon). They are taught customs and courtesies in depth and practice drill and ceremony. This is the most physical part of the training; the course is similar to federal boot camp curriculum and training without the physical component. Soldiers are required to maintain Army height and weight standards, but that is done on the soldier's own time. There is no CSG equivalent to Advanced Individual Training (AIT): This is done on the unit level once the soldier arrives from IET.\n\nOther schools are available to soldiers who want to rise in rank. These include NCOA (Noncommissioned Officer's Academy) which has three levels of courses: BLC (Basic Leadership Course: E4-E5), ALC (Advanced Leadership Course: E5-E6), and SLC (Senior Leadership Course: E7 and above). These courses are broken into four or five live-in phases at Camp San Luis Obispo for three days each. On the officer's side is OCS (Officer Candidate School) which is an intense, year-long course meeting six times at Camp San Luis Obispo for live-in phases of four days each. In both courses, work is done on-site and during the interim.\n\nWhile prior service soldiers retain any MOSq obtained previously, non-prior-service soldiers have no MOS qualification. When Army Knowledge Online (AKO) accounts were available, CSG soldiers could take courses and become MOSq in select MOS's; however there is no AKO replacement for non-veteran soldiers to obtain an MOS. Soldiers with civilian qualifications that meet or exceed Army standard for a particular MOS are used as Subject Matter Experts (SME) to train their National Guard counterparts. An example of this is the Small Arms Training Team (SATT) which is responsible for small arms training for the California National Guard.\n\nAs of 1 August 2016, the California State Guard has been reorganized. Most units have now been directly embedded with and placed under the operational control of National Guard units throughout the state. The current organization is as follows:\n\nThe command structure prior to August 2016 was as follows:\n\n\nLike other state defense forces, CSG members are generally not subject to federal activation. However, 10 USC 331-333 may grant powers to the federal government to call up the CSG, because militia is defined as both organized (National Guard) and unorganized under 10 USC 311(b). In addition, Article II, Section II of the United States Constitution further states:\n\n\"The President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the militia of the several states, when called into the actual service of the United States\"\n\nThe CSG accomplishes its Homeland Security Mission by providing individual soldiers, sailors, and airmen as well as rapid response teams to Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA) missions in the preparation, prevention, deterrence, preemption, defense, and mitigation of natural and man-made threats to California.\n\nMembers of the CSG are required to serve a minimum of 100 hours annually. Part of that time is spent at Unit Training Assemblies (drills) which are usually eight to twelve hours on one Saturday each month. Many units require two-day drills or more depending on their mission. These drills are used for training sessions, activity coordination, and to work with their National Guard counterparts. CSG soldiers embedded with National Guard units for training purposes will drill the full weekend - or longer - with their National Guard counterparts.\n\nCSG Soldiers of the Army Component wear the standard Army Service Uniform (ASU Class A and Class B) and Mess Dress for formal occasions, as well as the Army Combat Uniform (ACU), OEF (Multicam) and OCP Scorpion utility uniform. Wear-out date for the ACU is the same as the Army National Guard. CSG airmen of the Air Component wear the standard U.S. Air Force Service Dress and Mess Dress uniforms, as well as the Airman Battle Uniform (ABU) utilities. MARSCOM Sailors wear uniforms similar to USN NWU Type III, referred to as MWU (Maritime Working Uniform). All uniforms have distinctive state insignia designating them as a member of the California State Guard. This includes the buttons on the ASU, which are the same as worn by the California Highway Patrol on its dress uniforms, a unique beret flash, and a name badge indicating the wearer is a member of the \"CA State Guard\". Utility uniform nametapes bear the word \"California\" rather than \"U.S. Army\" or \"U.S. Air Force\". Unlike most SDFs, CSG personnel wear the U.S. Flag on their right shoulder (Army component wear \"Flag forward\"). Combat patches are worn on the right shoulder. A unique CA unit patch is worn on the left shoulder.\n\nAwards and decorations earned from prior service in other branches of the military may be worn, so it is not unusual to see a CSG Soldier wearing \"water wings\" earned while on active duty in the USN, and ribbons and decorations earned in other branches. CSG also has its own unique awards and decorations. All officers and enlisted members are responsible for purchasing their uniforms and accessories. This could require an initial investment of $300 or more for utility uniforms, boots and accessories. Purchase of an ASU, rucksack, LBE, etc. adds substantially to the cost. A yearly $125 uniform allowance has been authorized for all CSG soldiers and airmen who have maintained 100% attendance in a twelve-month period.\n\nThe Center for Military History has a Distinctive Unit Insignia which is worn by members. Legal Support Command wears the DUI for JAG.\n\nThe California Military and Veterans Code also provides for a naval branch. The California Naval Militia was founded in 1891 and grew to have many ships and sailors at statewide ports, from San Diego to Eureka. It provided officers and sailors to the U.S. Navy during the Spanish–American War and World War I. The California Naval Militia was reactivated in 1976 by the Governor of California. Unlike New York and the few other states with ship-borne active naval militia units, the California Naval Militia was, until 2017, a small unit of military lawyers and strategists who provided advice and legal expertise in the field of military and naval matters for the benefit of California's state defense force. The California Naval Militia was last mustered into the Navy during World War I.\n\nEffective 1 October 2015, California approved the process of reactivating and standing up the Naval Militia, initially taking the form of the \"Maritime Support Element\" per TAG policy memorandum dated 15 January 2016, as a component of the CASG (similar to the organization of the Maritime Regiment of the Texas State Guard) instead of a separate Branch like the New York and Ohio Naval Militias.\n\nOn 18 March 2017, the California State Guard established the Maritime Support Command (MARSCOM) under the command of CAPT (CA) M. Hanson, with SCPO (CA) E. Anderson as the MARSCOM Senior Enlisted Advisor, in a ceremony aboard the decommissioned WWII-era carrier USS \"Hornet\".\n\nIn March 2020, elements of the California State Guard were activated to provide emergency pre-hospital response to patients in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn 2019 CSG service members were activated to assist evacuation and rescue operation during the Russian River High Water Incident in Guerneville. CSG members were also instrumental in emergency management operations after the Ridgecrest earthquake in July 2019.\n\nCSG service members were again called to Emergency State Active Duty (ESAD) to assist firefighting, support, relief, and shelter operations during the Camp Fire in Butte County.\n\nService members of the CSG were activated on Emergency State Active Duty (ESAD) orders to assist firefighting, support, and relief operations during the Mendocino Complex and again during the Carr Fire.\n\nCalifornia severe winter storms, flooding, mudslides (DR-4308)\n\nIncident period: February 01, 2017 - February 23, 2017\nMajor Disaster Declaration on April 01, 2017\n\nThe CSG took an active and vital role in the 2008 Operation Lightning Strike, when Governor Schwarzenegger called on over 2,000 troops from the California Army National Guard, Air National Guard, and California State Guard to help overwhelmed firefighters fight statewide wildfires.\n\nA large-scale operation of the CSG was during Operation Fall Blaze in October/November 2007, in which over 100 citizen soldiers of the CASG were integrated with their National Guard counterparts to help firefighters fight the California wildfires.\n\nIn the 2007 comedy movie \"Delta Farce\", about a group of misfit reservists who think they are in Iraq when they are really in Mexico, the CSMR is alluded to when the characters played by Bill Engvall and Larry the Cable Guy say, \"We're just State Military Reserves\" \"Yeah, SMURFS!\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2111177", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2111177", "title": "Roddy McCorley", "text": "Roddy McCorley\n\nRoddy McCorley (died 28 February 1800) was an Irish nationalist from the civil parish of Duneane, County Antrim, modern day Northern Ireland. Following the publication of the Ethna Carbery poem bearing his name in 1902, where he is associated with events around the Battle of Antrim, he is alleged to have been a member of the United Irishmen and claimed as a participant in their rebellion of 1798.\n\nRoddy McCorley was the son of a miller and was born near Toome in the parish of Duneane, County Antrim. A few years before the 1798 rebellion McCorley's father is believed to have been executed for stealing sheep. These charges may have been politically motivated in an attempt to remove a troublesome agitator at a time of great social unrest. Following his father's execution, his family were evicted from their home.\n\nThere is uncertainty as to whether McCorley was actually actively involved with the predominantly Presbyterian United Irishmen or the predominantly Catholic Defenders. McCorley's role in the 1798 rebellion itself is unrecorded. In a poem written 100 years after the rebellion by Ethna Carbery, he is claimed to have been one of the leaders of the United Irishmen at the Battle of Antrim, however there is no contemporary documentary evidence to support this claim or prove that he was even active in the rebellion.\n\nAfter the rebellion, McCorley joined a notorious outlaw gang known as Archer's Gang, made up of former rebels and led by Thomas Archer. Some of these men had been British soldiers (members of the Irish militia) who changed sides in the conflict, and as such were guilty of treason and thus exempt from the terms of amnesty offered to the rank and file of the United Irishmen. This meant that they were always on the run in an attempt to evade capture. This \"quasi-rebel\" group were claimed to have attacked loyalists and participated in common crime. It is believed that McCorley was caught whilst in hiding, having been betrayed by an informer.\n\nAfter McCorley was arrested he was tried by court martial in Ballymena on 20 February 1800 and sentenced to be hanged \"near the Bridge of Toome\", in the parish of Duneane. His execution occurred on 28 February 1800. This bridge had been partially destroyed by rebels in 1798 to prevent the arrival of loyalist reinforcements from west of the River Bann.\n\nHis body was then dismembered and buried under the gallows, on the main Antrim to Derry road. A letter published in the Belfast Newsletter a few days after McCorley's execution gave an account of the execution and how McCorley was viewed by some. In it he is called Roger McCorley, which may be his proper Christian name.\n\nIn 1852, McCorley's alleged nephew Hugh McCorley was appointed foreman of construction of a new bridge across the River Bann at Toome. Hugh made plans to recover his uncle's body and on 29 June 1852, buried him in an unmarked grave at Duneane parish graveyard.\n\nHis alleged great-grandson, Roger McCorley, was an officer in the Irish Republican Army in the Irish War of Independence (1919–1921).\n\nDespite lack of contemporary evidence of McCorley's actual involvement in the United Irishmen rebellion, he became a major figure in nationalist-republican martyrology due to a song by Ethna Carbery called \"Roddy McCorley\", written in the 1890s. Historian Guy Beiner uncovered earlier references to Roddy McCorley in Presbyterian folklore, which he showed to have been repeatedly forgotten and obscured on the background of mainstream Presbyterian identification with Unionism.\n\nCarbery's ballad was re-popularised (without attribution) by The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem, The Dubliners, The Kingston Trio, and others during the folk music revival of the 1960s. It was recorded in 1995 by Shane MacGowan and The Popes for their album \"The Snake\" and has also been recorded by other contemporary artists, such as Heather Dale on her 2006 album \"The Hidden Path.\" The melody for \"Roddy McCorley\" was reused in 1957 for \"Sean South\", about a failed operation that year during the IRA's \"Border Campaign\".\n\nAn account of McCorley's career compiled in the early twentieth century from local traditions and correspondence with his descendants, \"Who Fears to Speak of '98?\", was written by the Belfast antiquary and nationalist Francis Joseph Bigger. It contains an edited version of an early 19th-century ballad about Roddy McCorley's fate.\n\n\n"}

Cancellation was formally announced at the Adult Swim panel at Comic-Con 2006.\n\nIn October 2006, Adultswim.com stated that \"Perfect Hair Forever\" was back in production with 16 episodes to be aired on its online streaming network \"The Fix\", though after episode seven aired, the series was never continued.\n\nEpisode 7 aired April 1, 2007, as part of Adult Swim's annual April Fool's Day joke, and was also available on Adult Swim's \"The Fix\" website.\n\nIn 2007, the Japanese noise rock band Melt-Banana recorded the song \"Hair-Cat (Cause the Wolf Is a Cat!)\" for \"Perfect Hair Forever\".\n\nThe \"Perfect Hair Forever\" pilot first aired on November 7, 2004, in the time slot that had been advertised as the premiere of the \"Squidbillies\" pilot. Unknown to the audience at the time, the existing \"Squidbillies\" pilot had fallen behind and wasn't ready to air. Williams Street continued advertising the \"Squidbillies\" premiere up to and including the bump directly preceding the show, which talked about wanting to make the show \"perfect\" for you and your \"hair\" \"forever\", revealing the title \"Perfect Hair Forever.\" The night's confusion continued when, instead of seeing the opening titles for \"Squidbillies\", viewers were confronted with a title card for an episode of \"Space Ghost\" called \"Perfect Hair Forever\", thus starting the pilot episode.\n\nAfter the ending credits ran, a bumper card appeared, apologizing for the apparent scheduling mixup only for it to fade out to a fake \"Technical Difficulties\" card featuring a selection of \"Perfect Hair Forever\" characters. This was shown on screen for several seconds, accompanied by typical music before the card faded to static whilst the Action Hot Dog's \"Do da la la la la!\" echoed. The card returned and the music was replaced with a techno remix of Action Hot Dog's chant.\n\nThe first season of \"Perfect Hair Forever\" premiered on Sunday, November 27, 2005, at 12:30 AM Eastern Standard Time with the airing of the second episode. The pilot re-aired on November 20, 2005, though without the \"Anime Talk Show\" discussion spoof.\n\nSeason 2 was supposed to contain 16 episodes, and was planned to premiere online on Adult Swim Video. On May 22, 2007, \"Return to Balding Victory\" debuted on Adult Swim Video, officially ending the series. This episode had already aired on television on April 1, 2007, as part of Adult Swim's April Fool's Joke. This joke spanned the entire block, beginning with this episode and then airing all of season one in reverse order and in the style of old VHS fansubs, complete with Engrish subtitles on most episodes. Occasionally, instead of the Engrish subtitles, transcripts from other Adult Swim shows were presented instead. It replaced scheduled premieres of \"Bleach\", \"Blood+\", and \"Eureka Seven\". The prank was hinted at though, as the schedule listed the same episodes that were to be shown that weekend for the next weekend ahead of time.\n\nSeven years after the series conclusion, an eighth episode was produced and aired unannounced on April 1, 2014, as part of Adult Swim's 2014 April Fools' Stunt. Two versions of this episode, \"Muscular Distraction - A\" and \"Muscular Distraction - B,\" exist and were aired at 12:00 AM and 12:15 AM respectively.\n\n\nOn October 27, 2009, Adult Swim and distributor Warner Home Video released \"Adult Swim in a Box\", a seven-disc DVD box set of various Adult Swim shows.\n\nThe pilot episode of \"Perfect Hair Forever\" appears in this set. In June 2010, the individual DVD was made briefly available for purchase at the Adult Swim website store.\n\nThe first season was released on iTunes. The entire series has been made available for free streaming on the Adult Swim website.\n\n"}

{"id": "2111194", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2111194", "title": "Carl H. Brans", "text": "Carl H. Brans\n\nCarl Henry Brans (; born December 13, 1935) is an American mathematical physicist best known for his research into the theoretical underpinnings of gravitation elucidated in his most widely publicized work, the Brans–Dicke theory.\n\nA Texan, born in Dallas, Carl Brans spent his academic career in neighboring Louisiana, graduating in 1957 from Loyola University New Orleans. Having obtained his Ph.D from New Jersey's Princeton University in 1961, he returned to Loyola in 1960 and later became the J.C. Carter Distinguished Professor of Theoretical Physics. Since then he has held visiting professorships at Princeton University, the Institute for Advanced Studies, and the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Koeln, Germany.\n\nBrans is well known among those engaged in the study of gravity and is noted for his development, with Robert H. Dicke of the Brans–Dicke theory of gravitation in which the gravitational constant varies with time, a leading competitor of Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity. The work of Brans and Dicke actually was closely related to earlier work of Pascual Jordan, but was developed independently. This formulation is often referred to as the Jordan–Brans–Dicke (JBD) scalar–tensor theory of gravity. In this theory, based on speculations of Mach, Eddington, Dirac and others, a universally coupled scalar field, in addition to the metric, is introduced which ultimately results in a theory in which the gravitational constant depends on the distribution of matter in the universe. A number of very accurate measurements made in the late 1970s has indicated that JBD fares no better than the simpler standard Einstein General Relativity, in the solar system context. However, developments in string theory and in inflationary cosmology have renewed interest in scalar field modifications of standard general relativity, although not in the original JBD form.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s Brans developed a complete and effective invariant classication of four dimensional Ricci at geometries, a type of post-Petrov approach, developing very early computer programs for symbolic manipulations. He summarized this work in terms of the complexification of the two-form fiber over space-time. He also worked on certain questions related to the apparently circular argument in proofs of Bell's theorem in which the hidden variables are a priori assumed to not influence detector settings, denying hidden variable causality from the beginning.\n\nFrom the 1980s on, Brans has considered certain developments in differential topology concerning the existence of exotic (non-standard) global differential structures and their possible applications to physics. This work includes looking at the exotic 7-sphere of Milnor as an exotic Yang-Mills bundle, and most especially the infinity of exotic differential structure on Euclidean four space (exotic R) as alternative models for space-time in general relativity. Much of this work has been done in collaboration with Torsten Asselmeyer-Maluga of Berlin. In particular, they proposed that exotic smoothness structures can resolve some of the problems in cosmology like dark matter or dark energy. Together they published a book, \"Exotic Smoothness and Physics\" World Scientific Press, 2007.\n\n"}
{"id": "2111204", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2111204", "title": "People With AIDS", "text": "People With AIDS\n\nPeople With AIDS (PWA) means \"person with HIV/AIDS\", also sometimes phrased as, Person Living with AIDS. It is a term of self-empowerment, adopted by those with the virus in the early years of the pandemic (the 1980s), as an alternative to the passive implications of \"AIDS patient\". The phrase arose largely from the ACT UP activist community, however use of the term may or may not indicate that the person is associated with any particular political group. \n\nThe PWA self-empowerment movement believes that those living with HIV/AIDS have the human rights to \"take charge of their own life, illness, and care, and to minimize dependence on others\". The predominant attitude is that one should not assume that one's life is over and will end soon solely because they have been diagnosed with HIV/AIDS. Although most of the earliest organizers have died, and organizations dissolved or reconfigured into AIDS service organizations (ASOs), the self-empowerment and self-determination aspects of the movement continue. \n\nIn New York City in 1982, one of the first People With AIDS (PWA) groups in the east was formed by Michael Callen and Richard Berkowitz. Callen and Berkowitz met through their doctor, Joseph Sonnabend. Initially, Callen and Berkowitz attended a peer support group for people with AIDS at Beth Israel Hospital, as well as meetings of Gay Men's Health Crisis.\n\nAfter some time, however, the two grew frustrated with the meetings, and left to form Gay Men With AIDS. In the same year, they wrote an article for the \"New York Native\" titled “We Know Who We Are: Two Gay Men Declare War on Promiscuity”. In it, they put forth that AIDS was the result of not a single virus, but a cumulative overload of the immune system, called the Immune Overload Theory, from sexual promiscuity and abuses of the body. Their hypothesis on the cause of AIDS has since been dismissed.\n\nIn mid-to-late 1982, Callen, Matthew Sarner, and several other people with AIDS became aware of the New York AIDS Network, which met every Tuesday morning at the East Village offices of the Community Health Project. The New York AIDS Network was founded by Hal Kooden, Virginia Apuzzo and a doctor, Roger Enlow, as an open political forum for the sharing of information related to AIDS.\n\nAs those in New York grew frustrated from listening to doctors, nurses, lawyers, insurance experts and social workers talk about AIDS, they realized they were hearing very little from the \"real\" experts. The decision was made to attend the Second National AIDS Forum at the National Lesbian and Gay Health Conference, which was sponsored by the Lesbian and Gay Health Education Foundation. By this point, some of the activists in New York learned of Bobbi Campbell and others in San Francisco. They learned that Campbell and others would be in attendance, and had been calling on organizations that provided AIDS services to sponsor gay men in order so that they may attend the conference. Alan Long, another person with AIDS, sponsored three of the New York activists to attend the conference in Denver.\n\nBobbi Campbell was a gay San Francisco man who was diagnosed with AIDS in September 1981, making him one of the first people in the US to be diagnosed with AIDS. On the recommendation of Marcus Conant, a doctor specializing in AIDS care, Bobbi began meeting with another man diagnosed with HIV, Dan Turner. The two met at Turner’s house in the Castro. There, they laid the groundwork for what was to become known as People with AIDS San Francisco. After that, Turner was invited to speak at the posthumous birthday party of Harvey Milk, the openly gay city supervisor of San Francisco who had been assassinated in 1978. On Castro street, Turner, as well as Campbell, identified themselves publicly as having AIDS. Turner’s speech urged people to do three things: keep informed, be cautious but not paranoid, and be supportive. This was the first of many speaking events for Campbell and Turner.\n\nShortly afterwards, a meeting was held to form the KS/AIDS Foundation, which later became the San Francisco AIDS Foundation. In May 1983, the first AIDS candlelight march led and organized by people with AIDS was held. The stated goal of the march was to draw attention to the plight of those with AIDS and to remember those who had died. The march was led by a banner with the slogan \"Fighting For Our Lives\", which became the motto of the movement.\n\nLater that month, on 23 May 1983, People With AIDS San Francisco voted to send Campbell and Turner to the National Lesbian and Gay Health Conference, at which the Second National AIDS Forum would be held.\n\nAt the conference, which had the theme “Health Pioneering in the Eighties”, people with AIDS from around the country met, gathering in a hospitality suite organized by Helen Shietinger, R.N. and Dan Bailey, who coordinated the event.\n\nBobbi Campbell took charge of the discussion. He believed in a political network of with groups of AIDS infected people in every major city. It was believed that these groups would then form a National Association of People With AIDS. There was very little friction between those in attendance, with only small arguments such as the terms patients and victims versus people with AIDS, the latter of which was agreed on as being the label of choice. This discussion led to the drafting of The Denver Principles.\n\nThe Denver Principles were drafted during the conference. They read:\nThe drafters of The Denver Principles stormed the closing of the conference in order to present their work. At the presentation, the San Francisco activists brought the “Fighting For Our Lives” banner. The presentation brought the crowd to tears, and it was ten minutes until the audience was able to compose itself. The keynote speaker, Ginny Apuzzo, in response to the presentation, opened with, “if those health care providers in attendance were the health care pioneers, then those of us with AIDS were truly the trailblazers”.\n\nAfter the Denver Conference, five of the activists (Bobbi Campbell, Richard Berkowitz, Artie Felson, Matthew Sarner, and Mike Campbell) began to plan for the National Association of People with AIDS while on the smoking section of the plane. Afterwards, the first of the political organizations planned was formed, called simply PWA-New York. While PWA-New York initially was met with resistance by the Gay Men's Health Crisis, the two organizations learned to coexist.\n\nPWA-New York is noted for designing the first safer sex poster to appear in New York bathhouses. Across the country, PWA organizations became active. In Denver, local PWA members took part in parades and lobbied in the legislature, in general, putting a human face on the disease. In San Francisco, posters similar to those in New York were distributed.\n\nIn June 1984, the annual Gay Freedom Day Parade in San Francisco was dedicated to people with AIDS. People With AIDS marched near the front of the parade, with Bobbi Campbell and the “Fighting For Our Lives” banner.\n\nBy the mid-eighties, PWA-New York faced challenges. A negative environment, combined with the deaths of many founders, led to the group being disbanded. However, the New York activists were quick to rebound, forming the PWA Coalition. PWA Coalitions continue to exist today throughout the country. In 1987, the National Association of People With AIDS was incorporated as a 501(c)3 not–for–profit corporation to be the national voice of people with AIDS. It was the oldest national AIDS organization in the United States and the oldest national network of people living with HIV/AIDS in the world when on February 14, 2013 NAPWA declared bankruptcy and announced it was suspending operations.\n\nIn 2009, the National Association of People with AIDS (NAPWA) and \"POZ\" magazine announced a new initiative called The Denver Principles Project. The Denver Principles Project will recommit the HIV community to the Denver Principles and dramatically increase NAPWA's membership. With a vastly increased membership, NAPWA will be better able to advocate for effective HIV prevention and care, as well as to combat the stigma that surrounds HIV and impedes education, prevention and treatment of HIV.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2111213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2111213", "title": "Spaghetti Warehouse", "text": "Spaghetti Warehouse\n\nSpaghetti Warehouse is an Italian restaurant chain geared towards families with five locations in two U.S. states: four in Ohio and one in New York. The chain started in 1972 in Dallas, Texas, and at one point had spread throughout the southern and eastern parts of the United States. Each restaurant has a trolley car in the dining room and patrons are able to sit in the car. One of Spaghetti Warehouse's unique characteristics is that many of the older locations are in renovated, historic buildings.\n\nThe location in Columbus, Ohio, which opened in 1978, is the largest both in seating capacity and in sales. The Columbus location seats approximately 800 people.\n\nSpaghetti Warehouse, Inc., was acquired in 1998 by Consolidated Restaurant Cos. (a holding company of the private equity firm Cracken, Harkey & Co. L.L.C.). In June 2007, Consolidated Restaurants sold the chain to the Los Angeles-based investment firm Frandeli, Inc.\n\nThe Old Spaghetti Factory, which started in 1969, has a very similar format; as does Houston, Texas-based Warehouse 72.\n\nThe original location, in the West End of Dallas, Texas, opened in 1972. The building was built in 1891 and served as a pillow factory for much of its history. The 3rd largest location in the chain, including two floors and private dining rooms, it was credited as the first restaurant-retail business in the neighbourhood that spurred the rebirth of the West End area of Downtown Dallas in the 1970s and 80s. It was home to many former brass bed headboards, an old confessional, and the headboard and footboard of a bed that belonged to Stephen F. Austin, which is now a booth that fits up to 8 people. An original East Dallas trolley car was in the main dining room. On October 2019, the location was shut down after 47 years.\n\nThe Austin location was the third location in the chain's history. Opened in 1975, and built in 1902, it used to be a grocery warehouse, and during prohibition, was a brothel. Two chandeliers from New York City's Penn Station reside there as well as the original box office from Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles, California. Like its Dallas counterpart, it is also home to an original East Dallas trolley car. The Austin location closed April 23, 2011 due to physical building issues.\n\nThe Columbus location was the first Spaghetti Warehouse outside of Texas, and the fifth to open in the chain. It opened in April 1978 in an old ice house built in the 1880s. It is the largest in the company and continually exceeds its counterparts in weekly sales. It is such a \"landmark\" in Columbus, that many diners there believe it to be the only location. It is home to two confessionals taken from churches in New England, as well as a 1920s German elevator in which patrons may sit for dinner. The original steam engine that kept the building cold when it was an ice house, is still located in its lobby. Another artifact there includes the head of a moose killed by former President Theodore Roosevelt along with its certificate of authenticity.\n\nThe Akron location opened in 1992 on the site of a former B. F. Goodrich Corporation warehouse, adjacent to the former B. F. Goodrich Corporation Headquarters until 1988 and the building was originally built in the 1870's as a warehouse of B.F. Goodrich tires. The Akron store features a 20-foot chandelier that once belonged to the Dunes Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. This location features several signs of former rubber tires companies that once called Akron home, as well as old arcade games and antiques. Diners can sit in an old hotel elevator, and a former Akron street trolley car. Although not one of the original, warehouse type stores from the 1970's and 1980's, it is in a historical building in a historical area, on the old B. F. Goodrich Corporation property.\n\nThe Memphis location was inside a typical warehouse of the late 19th to early 20th century. It was decorated with an original trolley used for transportation in downtown Memphis, and with doors and light fixtures from Memphis Union Station which had been abandoned and razed in 1968 to make way for a new post office. When Elvis Presley returned from the Army on 7 March 1960, he was greeted in Memphis Union Station by a crowd of several hundred fans. The station was located about southeast of the restaurant's current site. The restaurant closed in mid-November 2017 after 30 years of service.\n\nThe Houston location was the company's second location & the second largest, after Columbus, Ohio. It opened in 1973 in Downtown Houston. Like the Dallas location, it had two floors of dining. During lunch, guests were seated in a trolley structure for their meal. The Houston location is said to be haunted. Many employees refuse to speak on the matter, but there have been a few, who are willing to share. Many signs of haunting include floating wine glasses, strange flickers of light, mysterious sounds, and voices in the night. Some waiters report mysterious sightings, especially when working late at night. According to reports from a variety of sources, including the Houston Press, a managers willingly recounted the haunting tales. Long ago, the building that Spaghetti Warehouse currently occupies served as a pharmacy. One day, one of the pharmacists was tragically killed in by a freak accident in an elevator shaft. His wife, devastated by his death, died of a broken heart exactly one year later. Her spirit is said to haunt the second floor of the Spaghetti Warehouse. Visitors have taken pictures of mysterious figures, and creepy noises have been recorded. The creepy element of the restaurant attracts many thrill seekers, who seek to explore the spiritual world.\n\nIn late August 2017, Hurricane Harvey forced the restaurant to close as a result of water seeping through the top of the main floor, causing significant damage. It reopened in August 2019 as Warehouse 72/Butcher's Plates & Pizza, at the Marq*E Entertainment Center.\n\nThe Tampa store was located in the former tobacco storage warehouse of the Ybor Factory Building in the historic neighborhood of Ybor City. The building was constructed in 1886 and was the largest cigar factory in the world at the time. The walls and floors of the restaurant consist mainly of original exposed brick, and a replica of an Ybor City street car is located inside the main dining room. On 4 March 2016, it was announced this location would be closing, however, 5 days later the parent brand, BLD Brands, stated the location will remain open for another full year while another location is scouted. By 2 October the restaurant was out of business as efforts to save the building and relocate it were moot.\n\nThe Little Rock location opened on October 14, 1990, housed in the former Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway passenger station. This historic building had opened in 1901 as the Choctaw Route station, but had been vacant since 1968, after being purchased by the preservation minded owners of the Arkansas Gazette. At the time this Spaghetti Warehouse location opened, it was reported to be the company's most expensive renovation to date, and part of the dining area also include a 1924 Pullman car, originally named Mt. Sheridan, which had been used by the Cotton Belt Railroad. Spaghetti Warehouse also acquired an antebellum home, the Alexander George house, which had served as a division headquarters for the railroad. For four years, Spaghetti Warehouse worked with local preservationists in an effort to save this structure, which was finally razed in 1994. The slow pace of downtown Little Rock redevelopment doomed the restaurant, and this location was closed on February 4, 1996. The former passenger station building is today part of the Clinton Presidential Center.\n\nThe Norfolk location opened in 1991 and closed in 2001. It was housed in the Southern Bagging Company building, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.\n\nThe Tulsa location opened in the historic Brady Arts District in 1992 and had closed in late March 2017.\n\nThe Syracuse location opened in 1989 in a factory building that was originally built by L.B. Doman in 1909 for his Amphion Piano Player Company (moving it from Elbridge, New York). The building was later used as a pocketbook factory (Julius Resnick, Inc.) and then as a bakery warehouse before being acquired by the restaurant chain.\n\nNOTE: the Texas location is open daily but Mondays in limited hours due to COVID-19 outbreak; all others are allowing delivery/takeout.\n\n\n\n"}

Two imposing gateways lead to the main hall. It is said that there are 1024 ways to reach the terrace but only two to come back first gate or the last gate. It is an accidental architecture.\n\nConstruction of Bara Imambara was started in 1784, a year of a devastating famine, and one of Asaf-ud-Daula's objectives in embarking on this grandiose project was to provide employment for people in the region for almost a decade while the famine lasted. It is said that ordinary people used to work in the day building up the edifice, while noblemen and other elite worked at night to break down anything that was raised that day. It was a project that preceded a Keynesian like an intervention for employment generation. Construction of the Imambara was completed in 1791. The estimated cost of building the Imambara ranges between half a million rupees to a million rupees. Even after completion, the Nawab used to spend between four and five hundred thousand rupees on its decoration annually.\n\nThe architecture of the complex reflects the maturation of ornamented Mughal design, namely the Badshahi Mosque - it is one of the last major projects not incorporating any European elements or the use of iron. The main imambara consists of a large vaulted central chamber containing the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. At 50 by 16 meters and over 15 meters tall, it has no beams supporting the ceiling and is one of the largest such arched constructions in the world. There are eight surrounding chambers built to different roof heights, permitting the space above these to be reconstructed as a three-dimensional labyrinth with passages interconnecting with each other through 489 identical doorways. This part of the building, and often the whole complex, may be referred to as the \"Bhulbhulaiya\". Known as a popular attraction, it is possibly the only existing maze in India and came about unintentionally to support the weight of the building which is constructed on marshy land. Asaf-ud-Daula also erected the 18 meter (59 foot) high Roomi Darwaza, just outside. This portal, embellished with lavish decorations, was the Imambara's west-facing entrance.\n\nThe design of the Imambara was obtained through a competitive process. The winner was a Delhi architect Kifayatullah, who also lies buried in the main hall of the Imambara. It is another unique aspect of the building that the sponsor and the architect lie buried beside each other. The roof of Imambara is made up from the rice husk which makes this Imambara a unique building.\n\nThere is also a blocked tunnel passageway which, according to legends, leads through a mile-long underground passage to a location near the Gomti river. Other passages are rumored to lead to Faizabad (the former seat of power of the Nawabs), Allahabad, Agra and even to Delhi. They exist but have been sealed after a period of long disuse as well as fears over the disappearance of people who had reportedly gone missing, while exploring but still the reality has not been checked.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2111262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2111262", "title": "Gertrude Yorkes", "text": "Gertrude Yorkes\n\nGertrude Yorkes (self-referred to as Arsenic), is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. She was created by author Brian K. Vaughan and artist Adrian Alphona, and debuted in \"Runaways\" #1 with most of the other main characters. Like every member of the original Runaways, she is the daughter of evil villains with special abilities; in Gert's case, time-travellers. Gertrude, often called \"Gert\" for short, is often regarded as the most \"book-smart\" of the Runaways yet also the most sarcastic and cynical. She has socialist leanings and is ethnically Jewish but spiritually agnostic. Gert is known for her sarcastic one-liners, glasses, and purple-dyed hair. She stands at a rough height of 5'1\" and weighs .\n\nIn 2008, Marvel.com named Gert's death as the sixth out of ten best deaths in Marvel Comics history.\n\nGert Yorkes was portrayed by Ariela Barer in the Hulu television series \"Runaways\".\n\nGertrude Yorkes first appeared in \"Runaways\" #1 and was created by Brian K. Vaughan and Adrian Alphona.\n\nThe daughter of Dale and Stacey Yorkes, Gert is first seen flatly yelling that she does not want to go to the Wilders' annual supposed charity organization; after the witnessing of the murder of an innocent girl by their parents (\"the Pride\"), despite being shocked her parents are a part of it, Gert remains the only one not surprised that her parents are actually villains, saying that she had suspected her parents of being evil ever since her pet pig suspiciously disappeared. Gert joins her team in the mass ransack to escape from their respective homes. Before leaving, however, Gert discovers a dinosaur in a hidden room in her basement that has a telepathic bond with Gert's mind, meaning it obeys her every command. Clueing a holographic message featuring Gert's parents and the fact her basement is full of rare antiques, the Runaways conclude Gert's parents are actually time travellers. After running off, Gert takes the name Arsenic and dubs her dinosaur Old Lace, a reference to the film of the same name. While the other members take codenames to be more like superheroes, Gert takes her name to cut all ties to her parents and former life. Later she and the other Runaways decide to use their real names again, but Old Lace continues with her codename, since she did not have any name before.\n\nThroughout the entire first volume, Gert refuses to answer to her given name and sticks with her codename the longest of all the Runaways, who begin dropping their names. Gert's cynical view on her parents (and adults in general) also carries through the first and second volumes, where her belief her parents killed her pet pig becomes stronger. Though all the Runaways share a mutual distrust of adults, Gert remains the most fervent and vocal about the philosophy.\n\nGert's cynical attitude breaks when after resuscitating Chase from drowning (after their last encounter with the Pride), she shares a passionate kiss after he awakens; it's generally accepted that Chase and Gert become a couple at this point. After the battle, the government is forced to admit the Runaways are not murderers, but innocent victims. Gert is sent to live in a boarding school while the Avengers detain Old Lace in a secret holding facility in LA itself. A few months later, she runs away from the school to join up with her friends and, with Chase's assistance, frees Old Lace. She joins the cadre in the Leapfrog, an old Pride land/sea transport also confiscated by the Avengers, and runs away to start life as a full-time vigilante.\n\nThe second volume finds Gert fighting under Nico's command, still dating Chase. Meanwhile, one of her parents' old time machines appears in the new Hostel carrying a black-haired, physically fit woman without glasses, claiming to be Gert from the future; this version of Gert grew up to become the leader of the Avengers under the alias Heroine. Heroine warns the Runaways of Victor Mancha, a dormant teenage threat that will grow up to kill every hero under the alias \"Victorious.\" The future Gert dies in Chase's arms without being able to finish saying, \"I love you.\" The team fights and defeats Ultron, and Victor rewrites his programming and claims that he is free of Ultron's influence. Nico invites him to join the team. Shortly after the runaways' trip to New York City, a new Pride reveals a kiss shared between Chase and Nico to Gert; Gert is distraught and the Runaways begin to deteriorate; Molly gets kidnapped and Old Lace physically attacks Nico. Gert and Nico are able to put aside their differences long enough to rescue Molly from the new Pride, but during the rescue, Gert takes a dagger in the stomach to save Chase. In her final moments, Gert transfers empathic control of Old Lace to Chase, ensuring the dinosaur would live. Gert dies in Chase's arms, having forgiven Chase for kissing Nico. Her last words, are her lamenting that the older version of her never told Chase how she felt, she then dies without finishing saying \"I love you.\"\n\nChase bumps into a girl bearing an uncanny resemblance to the late Gert, who does not recognize him. Initially stunned, he chases her to catch up to her, recklessly running through impending traffic. She yells for him to stop, as a silhouette resembling Old Lace appears in an alley behind her, but he is struck by a van. The girl apparently leaves as paramedics rush Chase to a hospital.\n\nChase is eventually able to go back in time and rescue Gert from the moment of her death, taking her straight to Nico, who is able to save Gert's life through a rapid range of spells that include summoning a podiatrist (as the nearest doctor to Nico at the time) to treat Gert's injuries. Although she swiftly returns to her old bond with Old Lace, Gert is shaken to learn how the Runaways have fallen apart since her death, her words inspiring the team to come back together, rescuing Molly from her manipulative grandmother. \n\nGert rarely interacts with Karolina. The two have been noted to remark upon each other's appearance or family, but are rarely seen conversing like the other characters. Gert is one to often babysit Molly, though Molly has more brotherly relationships with Chase and Victor. Gert, despite her foreshadowing future of her and Victor, often defended him. Gert dated Chase from \"Runaways\" volume 1, issue 16 to \"Runaways\" volume 2, issue 18. Their relationship was often defined by bickering - Chase's dim-witted moments often clashed with Gert's sarcastic and intelligent quips. Gert's relationship with Chase softened her somewhat, though she did not entirely lose her sarcastic edge. Their relationship developed quickly, with a few off-hand comments suggesting that they shared the same bed and were sexually intimate. However, their relationship was threatened when Gert learned that Nico had kissed Chase; though Chase rebuffed Nico's advances, Gert was still hurt that Chase had kept the interaction hidden from her. She revealed her insecurity about her appearance and fear that Chase would eventually leave her for a more conventionally pretty girl. Though implying she was hurt beyond reconciliation, she still ran into a burning building to save Chase from Geoffrey Wilder after their falling out. She bluffed some details about Chase's past to keep Geoffrey from sacrificing Chase and Geoffrey fell for the bluff, but plunged his dagger into Gert's stomach instead. As she lay dying, she transferred control of Old Lace to Chase and died forgiving Chase for Nico's kiss and without finishing saying she loved him.\n\nGert and Nico had been friends since birth. Nico reveals that Gert had always been a liberal thinker when Gert hid all of Nico's My Little Pony dolls in the forest because Gert thought the animals should be free. Nico knit Gert a purple scarf for her birthday and it prompted Gert to dye her hair the same color. Although she sometimes questioned Nico, Gert always stood by her friend with unwavering loyalty. Gert's loyalty did not go unrecognized, as Nico requested that Gert take over leadership if something should happen. Although their relationship strained after Gert discovered Nico's kiss, they reconciled shortly afterwards, following a round of tossing insults and internet slang, demonstrating the close relationship and respect they shared. Nico grieved for a long time following Gert's death and even experienced survivor's guilt.\n\nAfter Gert is 'resurrected' by Chase taking a trip back in time and bringing the dying Gert into the present to be saved, Gert swiftly helps bring the rest of the Runaways back into one team.\n\nGert has no physical powers, but a mental link with Old Lace. Old Lace makes her first appearance after being discovered in a secret compartment in Gert's basement. Gert discovered that she had a telepathic bond to Old Lace when the dinosaur halted from devouring the Runaways because Gert yelled out \"STOP IT!\" in fear. In one of the Runaways' early encounters with the Pride, Gert also discovered she had an empathic bond to Old Lace when she experienced the same pain Old Lace felt. Gert's telepathic bond to Old Lace allowed her to directly communicate with the dinosaur and command it to do anything she wished. The bond worked both ways, enabling Old Lace to transfer her thoughts directly to Gert, but Old Lace could not give commands to Gert in the same fashion. Old Lace was unconditionally loyal to Gert, even to the point of fighting against the team; Old Lace once lashed out at Nico without Gert's orders when Gert and Nico had their brief falling out. Gert and Old Lace's empathic bond was beneficial in that whenever one was healed, the other would always get better. However, it also made each known to injuries they would not normally be grossly affected by. For example, in \"Runaways\" volume 2, issue 7, Gert refuses to fight Swarm because she is allergic to bee stings and posits that even one sting on Old Lace could end the both of them.\n\nThough Gertrude herself possessed no powers she seemed to have a high level of intellect at her age being able in the first volume to understand how Cloaks' cape and powers worked and how to revive them. While Marvel Handbook files have indeed given her intelligence levels a rating of 4 out of 7, and thus reasonably higher than the average mind, equal to Alex or even Victor Mancha's, she was not quite a genius. In the third volume when the team reunited and got back, when she returned to the team with Molly stating \"It's hard to trick the guards when they're all psychics\", though unknown if it was sarcasm or true. In the first volume her smarts seemed to be on the same level as Alex Wilder seeing to be the first to understand him.\n\nIn the original pitch for the series, Gert was originally referred to as Gertie. She also had the sibling-like relationship with Molly that Chase has in the series, and was the one who named Molly 'Bruiser' instead of Chase.\n\n\n\nArsenic and Old Lace (disambiguation)\n"}

{"id": "2111270", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2111270", "title": "Karolina Dean", "text": "Karolina Dean\n\nKarolina Dean ( ), also briefly known as Lucy in the Sky, or L.S.D., is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character first appeared in the series \"Runaways\". Like every member of the original Runaways, she is the daughter of evil super-powered criminals; while searching through her parents' home, Karolina inadvertently discovers that her parents were Majesdanian invaders. Majesdanians are an alien race that absorbs solar energy and re-radiates it in the form of the colors of the rainbow. She is often called \"Kar,\" “Karo,” or \"K\" for short, and is known for her free spirit and kind nature.\n\nKarolina is the only extraterrestrial in the group, except for a period of time when her Skrull fiancée, Xavin, becomes part of the team. \"Runaways\" creator Brian K. Vaughan played a significant role in the character's subsequent development as well as artist/writer Adrian Alphona, both of whom spent most of the first volume of the series hinting that Karolina was romantically attracted to fellow member Nico Minoru. By \"Runaways\"'s fourth relaunch, Karolina's storyline picks up with her relationship with Lightspeed of Power Pack referenced in \"Avengers Academy\".\n\nKarolina Dean was portrayed by Virginia Gardner in the Hulu television series \"Runaways\" which is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This version of the character is half human and half Gibborim.\n\nKarolina Dean was created by author Brian K. Vaughan & artist Adrian Alphona and debuted in \"Runaways\" #1.\n\nKarolina is the daughter of renowned Hollywood actors Frank and Leslie Dean and is the only older Runaway who didn't witness their parents murder an innocent girl as a sacrifice. Karolina denies the entire situation primarily, but finally believes the group soon after discovering she is an alien. The kids decide to go for a massive ransack, and leave home; before leaving for good, they decide to put their parents to justice by collecting certain evidence from their homes. When arriving at the Dean mansion, they find Karolina's parent's last will and testament; Karolina is given a piece of paper with the circular \"no symbol\" covering the Caduceus. Alex convinces her to remove her medic alert bracelet because it is emblazoned with the symbol. Karolina angrily concedes, thinking that she only wears the bracelet because she's allergic to penicillin, and her skin immediately glows with a fluid, rainbow-like light. Remembering something they heard from the Pride's sacrifice, the group assumes Karolina is an alien and the bracelet is an anchor to hide her powers; Leslie Dean later confirms these theories for Karolina. After escaping their parents, Karolina takes the name Lucy in the Sky, a reference to the song \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\".\n\nEarly in the series, Karolina constantly struggled with her alien heritage, feeling that she is a \"freak\" amongst the group, the only one who needs to actively hide her true form. Another insecurity was of her speculated homosexuality. Her insecurities even prompt Karolina to offer her life to the vampire Topher, as Karolina expresses little desire to live. After her first near-death experience at the hands of Alex Wilder, Karolina overcomes her death wish and helps the Runaways escape the rampaging Gibborim as the Pride fight their former benefactors. After the Pride's defeat, Karolina is sent to live with foster parents, but she organizes a secret reunion for the Runaways, after which they run away again, this time to the Pride's old lair beneath the La Brea Tar Pits. Karolina is portrayed as having a wide, free spirit, notably when she discovers she can fly. But she is also shown as being quite sensitive, often crying at her pain and misfortune, as well as the pain and misfortune of others.\n\nIn the early issues of \"Runaways\", volume 2, Karolina fights under the command of de facto leader Nico. Karolina expresses more comfort with being an extraterrestrial and makes strong hints at being a lesbian, especially as she stops to compliment Julie Power on her beauty during a battle with Excelsior over the custody of Victor Mancha and later even agrees to go on a date with her following a joint Avengers Academy/Runaways mission (and would eventually become romantically involved). Soon after Victor joins the team, Karolina \"comes out\" to Nico with an attempted kiss, which Nico rejects outright. Karolina's \"outcast\" insecurities resurface when her Skrull fiancée Xavin comes to Earth in search for her. Unbeknownst to her, Karolina's parents arranged Xavin's and Karolina's marriage as part of a peaceweaving effort between the Skrull and Majesdanian (her species) homeworlds. Karolina leaves with Xavin, much to Nico's distress.\n\nWhile on her home planet Majesdane, Karolina learns to control the shift between her Majesdanian and humanoid forms and how to further control her solar powers. However, the wedding does not go as planned and the couple flees towards Earth as their homeworlds reignite the old war. They crash land near the Hostel and return in time to assist in the rescue of Molly Hayes. Karolina has a dream of her parents tearing her apart. Karolina remains with the team and Xavin becomes accepted as a member after Gertrude Yorkes' death, and they both join the Runaways in defeating the Gibborim for good. When the Runaways are accidentally displaced in 1907, Karolina meets Klara Prast, and convinces everyone to accept her on the team.\n\nIn \"S.W.O.R.D.\" #2, Karolina is one of the aliens kidnapped by Henry Gyrich in his \"aliens go home\" policy. He uses pheromones to target Karolina's Majesdanian physiology and leads her away from the Runaways and kidnaps her without difficulty. She was eventually freed along with the other aliens. She assists in saving the Earth from a fleet of murder-happy aliens. Abigail Brand, now the sole head of S.W.O.R.D., returns all the aliens to Earth, reassuring them they will have their freedom and they are each owed one favor. In \"Avengers Arena\", Karolina and Molly sought out Hank Pym for help when Nico and Chase go missing. Karolina dismissed Molly's concerns that somebody took their friends instead she believed they ran off to be together. Karolina later appears in the pages of \"Avengers Undercover\" where she and Molly visit Nico and Chase in the S.H.I.E.L.D. detention center after Hazmat allegedly killed Arcade. Karolina entered a relationship with Julie Power of Power Pack. \n\nAfter the Runaways disbanded for some time, Karolina has moved on to a happy new life in college and left behind her anxieties over her old life with the help of therapy; thus, declined the invitation to reunite even with the return of undead Gert. Karolina reasoned she had grown up and changed from their time as scared kids on the run. She also felt it didn't make sense for them to get back together because they were never a team, like the Avengers, or had a mission, other than staying alive and not becoming their parents. Nico agreed with Karolina's assessment, but it still left her riddled with guilt. Karolina dropped by Nico's apartment to reconsider the reunion when Nico attempted to kiss Karolina but is rejected due to having a girlfriend and dismissed it as Nico's habit of seeking comfort at times of stress. The Runaways banded together to rescue Gert and Molly from Molly's mad scientist grandmother's house. Karolina avoided hurting Molly's grandmother and her genetically engineered creations; however, once Nico was struck by a telepathic attack, Karolina blasted the house and put an end to it. Battered but finding solace together as a makeshift family, they all decided to go home. \n\nThe Runaways resettled into their old hideout, the Hostel. Karolina is fitting in like she never left like her friendship with Nico hasn't missed a beat, but she struggles to give equal attention to her classes and girlfriend. When Julie's eagerly awaited visit is interrupted by Doctor Doom's attack on the hostel, Karolina and Julie don't see eye-to-eye on how Runaways improvise-styled battle plan and their functionality as a super-hero family team works. Julie expressed frustration of Karolina not opening up in their relationship, especially about her past that's now her present. To drown her sorrows in sugar over Karolina ignoring her once again, Julie unknowingly ate an enchanted cupcake that transformed her back to a thirteen year old forever. The Runaways eventually reverse the spell, but Julie still broke up with Karolina as she felt Karolina placed her membership in the Runaways on a higher priority. While Nico and Karolina bonded over lost loves, Karolina admitted she had been neglecting Julie which, perhaps, made their breakup inevitable. Following the break-up, Karolina invited Nico to attend her parents’ legitimate children's charity ball with her. While there, Nico confessed her feelings asking Karolina for a second chance. Karolina was surprised and scared. After some hesitation that left Karolina feeling rejected again, Nico finally seized her chance and the two kissed, beginning a relationship.\n\nKarolina gets along well with the other Runaways, and the only time she had ever got into an argument with them was after they questioned her about Xavin's gender. She has an older-sister type relationship with Molly, but a caring relationship with both Chase and Victor, whom she had both comforted after they lost loved ones.\n\nIt was subtly hinted throughout the first volume of \"Runaways\" that Karolina had harbored a longtime crush on Nico. Much later, Karolina attempted to kiss Nico, but was rejected. Karolina then came out to Nico as a lesbian, admitting her feelings for Nico. After deciding to leave Earth to marry Xavin, Karolina left her medical alert bracelet with Nico as a token of remembrance. When Karolina later returned to Earth, she accidentally confessed to Xavin (who had taken on the form of Nico) that she was still in love with Nico. Despite this, Karolina remained staunch in her devotion to Xavin, and thus her feelings for and attraction to Nico occasionally put a strain on their friendship.\n\nWhen the Runaways re-banded some time later, Nico made possible romantic overtures towards Karolina, ultimately attempting to kiss her. However, Karolina rejected Nico out of faithfulness to Julie and dismissed it as Nico's habit of seeking comfort in times of stress. Following Julie and Karolina's break-up, Karolina invited Nico to attend her parents’ legitimate foundation's a charity ball with her. While there, Karolina's usual nervousness was replaced by newfound confidence because of Nico's support as she's felt Nico had “always seen the real” her. Nico confessed she was confused about herself for so long she couldn't see her clearly. Nico knows who and what she wants now and asks Karolina for a second chance. Karolina was surprised and scared, which exacerbated her old feelings of rejection when Nico pulled away. But Nico seized her chance and the two kissed, beginning a relationship.\n\nXavin came to Earth to marry Karolina, revealing that their parents had arranged a marriage between the two of them in order to keep Earth safe from Skrull attacks. Karolina initially rejected Xavin; Xavin attempted to persuade her, explaining that the marriage would be part of a peace treaty. Karolina still refused, stating that it would be a \"lie\" for her to marry a man. Xavin then revealed that Skrulls had the ability to shapeshift into different sexes, prompting Karolina to decide to accept the marriage proposal. However, they were later unable to get married when war broke out again between the Skrulls and Majesdanians. They escaped to Earth and re-joined the Runaways. Throughout their relationship, Karolina apparently fully accepted Xavin's continued changing between male and female appearances. However, she secretly expressed confusion and doubts over Xavin's true gender. However, during an argument, Xavin subconsciously reverted to female human form, which pleased Karolina. Their relationship ended when Xavin left Earth with a remaining group of Majesdanians, sacrificing themself for Karolina.\n\nKarolina flirted with and later began dating Julie Power, after a trip to Avengers Academy; this resulted in long-term relationship. Julie attempted to convince Karolina to move to New York so they could be together full-time after the past year apart, though Karolina was resistant to this. After visiting Karolina in Los Angeles, Julie broke up with her, believing that she and Karolina were too incompatible and that Karolina's first priority would always be to the Runaways.\n\nLike all Majesdanians, Karolina's natural form is luminous, iridescent, and visually fluid, often depicted with waves of rainbow-like light floating off her body (Chase described her as \"a burning painting\") though body structure is essentially humanoid. Originally, Karolina required a custom made medic alert bracelet constructed of an unspecified alien metal to revert to humanoid form. However, after spending many months on Majesdane, Karolina learned to control the change and can make it at will. In her Majesdanian form, Karolina is able to manipulate solar energy absorbed by her body to generate large concussive blasts, fine laser-like beams and force fields capable of stopping cave-ins, gunfire and explosions. Like her parents, Karolina learned the ability to bind people, binding a New Pride in a colorful sphere. Karolina's Majesdanian form also grants her the ability to fly. During an encounter with the vampire Topher, it is revealed that Karolina's blood also harbors solar energy-based properties, because drinking her blood caused Topher to combust.\n\nThe drawback to Karolina's powers is that they have a finite charge. If she is in her Majesdanian form too long or exerts her powers too much, her glow will start to fade and revert her to human form until she uses the sun's rays to recharge. The only time she entirely lost her powers was when the Runaways battled the Gibborim to prevent Chase from sacrificing himself. Leslie Dean stated early in the series that Majesdanians' abilities do not affect one another.\n\nIn Brian K. Vaughan's original pitch for the series, Karolina Dean was originally called Leslie. This name would eventually be given to the character's mother. Her parents were originally real estate agents, rather than famous actors.\nKarolina's Majesdanian form has been colored in two distinct styles. Brian Reber, the first colorist of \"Runaways\", colored Karolina with many different colors of the visible spectrum from panel to panel. Christina Strain, the second colorist for \"Runaways\", colors Karolina in lighter tones, using primarily blue, yellow, and pink with a glitter-like effect.\n\nKarolina Dean is mentioned as being a \"go-to\" girl for the Wolfpack. However, this is a ploy to capture the Wolfpack. It is mentioned, however, that the Pride rule Southern California.\n\nA zombie Karolina Dean is attacking Kitty Pryde and her son Peter in \"Marvel Zombies Halloween\". She is stopped by Mephisto.\n\n\n\n"}

Lazard.\n\nWithin two weeks after Cohn's death, no will could be produced, and the right to share in his estate of $67,762 was demanded by a woman named Delphina Varelas, who claimed that Cohn had fathered her seven children, four of whom were still living—Bernard M.J, Miguel Daniel, Marcus Cerracio and Edward Anastacio. Verelas said she had met Cohn when she was 17 and he was about 30. They lived together on New High Street from 1872 to 1874, although Cohn had a wife who was still alive. Later Cohn provided houses for his second family on the Los Angeles Plaza, Sainsevin Street and Buena Vista Street. Cohn's estate included the Pico House, the St. Elmo Hotel and 1,100 acres of ranch land.\n\nThe trial was described as \"one of the most sensational in the annals of the Probate Court,\" and more than three hundred witnesses were called, some of whom testified that Cohn and Varelas were considered husband and wife and some that she was \"only Cohn's mistress.\" There was testimony that the couple had been married under a written contract, which Judge Clark nevertheless ruled to be invalid. Therefore, he decided in his judgment, the right of inheritance was applicable only in the case of three of Varelas's children—those whom Cohn had acknowledged to be his—and not to the eldest child or to Varelas herself. Upon appeal, a settlement was reached in which the three \"legitimate\" children would receive \"the sum of $7300, in full satisfaction of their claim against the estate.\"\n\nAt the age of fourteen Cohn worked as a seaman on a vessel that sailed around Cape Horn and docked in San Francisco, where the boy left ship to head for the gold country. He worked on sheep ranches in Montana between 1851 and 1856, finally settling in Los Angeles in 1857. He set up as a wool buyer, with a loan and mortgage office, in a combined office-home at 182 Main Street. In 1871 he partnered with Herman Hellman, Abraham Haas, and Jacob Haas to open a grocery business on Los Angeles Street.\n\nIn 1893, Cohn made an arrangement with Pio Pico, the last Mexican governor of California, whereby Cohn handed over some sixty thousand dollars in exchange for a deed to Pico's property in Los Angeles and elsewhere in the county. Pico claimed the exchange amounted to a mortgage and when he offered to redeem the property, Cohn refused the offer, stating that the transaction had been a sale. Pico sued and lost in court and, on appeal, the California Supreme Court sided with Cohn in a decision that left Pico stripped of his property and virtually a pauper. The decision, \"Pico v. Cohn\" (1891) 91 Cal. 129, 133-134, is classically cited by California appellate courts in cases having to do with the setting-aside of a judgment in case of fraud.\n\nA Democrat, Cohn was elected to the Los Angeles Common Council in December 1876 to represent the 2nd Ward and served two one-year terms. He returned to the council in 1880 from the 4th Ward, was defeated in a re-election bid but came back again to win in 1887 and in 1888. Cohn was acting mayor of Los Angeles between November 21 and December 5, 1878, having been appointed by the Common Council to the position after the death of Frederick A. MacDougal. Cohn later ran for the mayoralty, but lost to J. R. Toberman. \n\nCohn worked to help the Jewish population of Los Angeles, founding and financing a Cohn Memorial Clinic for indigent Jews on Whittier Boulevard.\n\nHe was a member of what was said to be the city's first social club, called the Los Angeles Social Club, organized about 1869.\n\n"}

{"id": "2111292", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2111292", "title": "Chase Stein", "text": "Chase Stein\n\nVictor Chase Stein (also known as Talkback), is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He was created by author Brian K. Vaughan and artist Adrian Alphona, and debuted in \"Runaways\" vol. 1 #1 with most of the other main characters. Like every member of the original Runaways, he is the son of evil villains with special abilities; in Chase's case, mad scientists. Chase is often regarded as the \"wild card\" in the series, due to his often changing role in the group, from being the getaway guy and technical guru to the \"loose cannon\" after he departed the group for a short while. However, despite his rule-breaking persona, Chase is fiercely loyal to his friends and remains a valued member of the team. Chase is the eldest of the Runaways at age 18. Chase shares a psychic and empathic link with \"Deinonychus\" Old Lace, granting him the ability to command the dinosaur to do his bidding and also possesses the Fistigons, the world's most powerful gauntlets.\n\nChase Stein was portrayed by Gregg Sulkin in the Hulu television series \"Runaways\" which is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nChase Stein first appeared in \"Runaways\" # 1 (July, 2003) and was created by Brian K. Vaughan and Adrian Alphona.\n\nChase Stein appeared in \"Avengers Arena\", written by Dennis Hopeless and illustrated by Kev Walker as well as its sequel, \"Avengers Undercover\".\n\nThe son of Victor and Janet Stein, Chase is first seen taking a punch from his abusive father for getting straight C's and being a \"dumb athlete\"; after the witnessing of the murder of an innocent girl by their parents (\"the Pride\"), Chase appears not to be surprised, though blames everyone else's parents for the murder. Chase joins the team in the mass ransack to escape from their respective homes. While going through Chase's parents' homes, he discovers that his parents are mad scientists, with many technological advances. Chase steals the Fistigons, which Janet Stein calls \"the world's strongest gloves\". Able to conjure and mold fire with the gloves, Chase also steals the special X-ray goggles from his parents. The Fistigons are later destroyed, giving Chase the role of \"getaway guy\". Chase provides the Runaways with their first hideout, a dilapidated caved-in mansion he called \"the Hostel,\" and their first transport, his white, unmarked van with stolen license plates. After running off, Chase wishes to take the name Neo, but Gert calls him Talkback, a reference to his defiant nature. It is later revealed Janet's pregnancy with Chase prompted the remaining Pride to have kids, and to give them eternal life in continuing the Pride.\n\nWhen Chase first confronts his parents (in their scientific villain-attire), Chase remains defiant and unafraid of his parents, firmly establishing himself as the most rebellious and reckless of the group, a trait he carries for the rest of Brian K. Vaughan's initial run on the title. Chase is portrayed as having a free, reckless spirit, shown when he purposely repeatedly crashes the Leapfrog.\n\nChase is known for having a temper; after the death of Gert, Chase leaves the team for a time, with the intention of resurrecting Gert in exchange for selling his own life. The search for Victor Mancha ends up being personal for him, to kill the one person who'd be destined to murder Gert. Chase also mentions he had murdered someone in the past, and refuses to talk about it. An associate to the Kingpin describes him as being simple, despite his scientific pedigree.\n\nChase seems to be a devout Christian - when attacked by Old Lace, he recites The Lord's Prayer, and he later refers to the Devil as a real being. He also called Karolina an angel after her alien origins are revealed.\n\nSince the Fistigons and X-ray goggles were destroyed, Chase resumes his \"getaway guy\" role as the Leapfrog pilot in the second volume. In a relationship with Gert, Chase is able to comfort Nico over the loss of Karolina; two issues later, Nico kisses him, straining their relationship. When a new incarnation of the Pride reveals Chase and Nico's kiss to Gert, she ends up hurt, angered, and the resulting friction almost tears the Runaways apart and seriously wears on Chase, but the group reconciles in time to rescue Molly. After Gert's death, Chase departs the Runaways for a short period, but he is convinced to return, after turning eighteen. Chase strikes a deal with the Gibborim to exchange one innocent soul for Gert's life and eventually settles on sacrificing himself, viewing his life as worthless compared to Gert's. This deal fails to please the Gibborim, as going through with this removed Chase's 'innocent' status. Chase is saved from making a dire mistake, and is gratefully allowed to return after learning that his grief nearly destroyed all his friends.\n\nIn \"Runaways\" Vol. 3 #7, the Runaways pay little attention to Chase's opinions, prompting Chase to question his role on the team. In \"Runaways\" Vol. 3 #9, the last issue to have been written by Terry Moore, features Chase acting as an older brother to Molly and Klara. Moore had wanted this storyline to heavily focus on Chase's relationship with the team, and identifies him as a kid who \"will grow up to become the next Captain America.\"\n\nIn \"Runaways\" Vol. 3 #11, the first issue written by Kathryn Immonen and drawn by Sara Pichelli, Chase, Nico, Victor and Karolina hold a house prom. An outside source manages to send a UAV flying into the Runaways' Malibu home, in the upstairs living room where Klara and Old Lace lie. Nico, Victor and Karolina rush to save Klara and Old Lace - upon arriving at the top, however, it's revealed that Old Lace had shielded Klara, who ends up alive. Old Lace, however, dies. Chase, feeling her death because of their link, falls into a slump and repeatedly mutters an apology for Gert. In \"Runaways\" Vol. 3 #12 Chase encounters a man claiming to be his (paternal) uncle Hunter Stein. Chase believes the man is lying because he remembers killing his uncle and driving off. Not long thereafter, Chase makes the error of following a girl resembling Gertrude, and is hit by a car, ending up in the hospital. However, he is shown in S.W.O.R.D. #2 alive and well with the group in Los Angeles. It is later revealed that the other Runaways are aware of Chase being hit by a car, but he apparently did not reveal to them further details of what happened.\n\nWhen Daken, the psychopathic son of Wolverine, invades the Runaways' home, Chase knocks him out with his gloves.\n\nChase began having dreams about Old Lace, but soon began sensing her presence in his waking hours. He asked Nico to try to find it and discovers that Old Lace was sent to a different dimension as a result of Nico's spell to put her to rest. Chase led the Runaways to the Avengers Academy to receive help from Giant-Man and Reptil. After a brief skirmish, the two teams join forces to open a portal and find Old Lace in a prehistoric dimension.\n\nChase and Nico are later abducted by Arcade and placed into an arena with other young heroes where they are forced to fight to the death. The two try to form an alliance with Hazmat, Reptil and X-23, reasoning that they can work together to find a way to escape. The alliance soon dissolves after an unknown party frames Chase for an attack on Reptil. While fleeing, Chase finds the amulet that belonged to the presumably deceased superhero Darkhawk. The amulet attaches itself to Chase's body and transforms him into the new Darkhawk. He was then possessed by Apex in his Darkhawk armor, resulting in him cutting off Nico's arm and causing her death. When the Staff of One resurrects Nico, it increases her power level enough to destroy the Darkhawk armor and defeat Apex. Chase returns to his normal self and then helps Nico and Reptil fight a possessed Cullen. In the ensuing battle, Nara is killed returning Cullen to human form and Anachronism goes wild. Reptil asks Nico and Chase for help breaking up the fight, but Nico insists she and Chase stay out of it. At Nico's command, Chase then turns into Darkhawk and sucker-punches Reptil as part of some secret plan that he and Nico devised. Chase showed regret at having to attack Reptil. When Chase refused to let Cammi stop Nico, she broke his arm and leg, taking the Darkhawk amulet for herself in order to stop Nico from killing everyone. Cammi gives Chase the amulet again when Apex unleashes bugs, sentient typhoon, and weaponized sand to attack the remaining teens on Murderworld. Soon after, Deathlocket stops the fight by killing Apex, and everyone is able to escape Murderworld and disperse.\n\nOnce news broke about Arcade's kidnappings, Chase and the other Murder World Survivors became infamous at the start of \"Avengers Undercover\". Unlike the others, Chase has gone public, opening up his story to several talk shows much to Nico's chagrin. Chase now has shaved most of his head in favor of a mohawk, has gotten his ears pierced, and constantly wears sunglasses. However, when Cammi and Anachronism reveal that Cullen Bloodstone has gone missing, all the survivors team up to head to Bagalia to find him. Once they do, he reveals that he enjoys life among the villains, and the others, minus Cammi, start to enjoy it as well. When Cammi tries to tell the others to leave, Bloodstone instead has Daimon Hellstrom teleport the group to Arcade's latest party so they can kill him.\n\nAfter Hazmat seemingly kills Arcade, the group decides to infiltrate Bagalia by pretending to join Baron Zemo's Masters of Evil, excluding Deathlocket who they never had a chance to inform of the plan. On a mission to A.I.M. Island, Deathlocket has a chance to shoot Captain America. When she tries to take the shot, Chase tries to talk some sense into her by having her \"choose who she is fighting for.\" Excavator gets into a scuffle with Chase. Deathlocket tries to get them to stop and finally opens up her arm cannon and shoots Chase in the chest, seriously wounding him. Though Nico is able to cast a \"Fix him\" spell to heal his body, he remains in a coma.\n\nHe is next seen, apparently fully recovered, enjoying some vacation time on a lake with the rest of the group in the final issue of the series.\n\nSome time after the team's last appearance, Chase salvaged the Leapfrog and went back in time to rescue Gert from the moment of her death, taking her into the present so that Nico can heal her injuries. Time-displaced Gert felt confused and left behind by her friends who had grown up without her. Chase comforted her telling her he would never abandoned her and in fact, came back for her. Gert tells Chase they can’t be anything anymore because of their current age difference. He also received Victor's head in the post from the Avengers after Victor was destroyed by Vision's new family, which Chase eventually reactivated. Although in reality, Victor awoke weeks earlier with his \"Victorious\" program booted and just remained 'asleep' until Chase aggravated him enough to tell him they must go rescue Molly and Gert from Molly's creepy grandmother. Chase re-banded the team and rescued Molly and Gert and reported the grandmother to the Avengers. The Runaways resettled into their old hideout, The Hostel, which Chase repaired and remodeled. He was determined to step up as a provider for his found family and got a job. Also, Chase and Nico magically became Molly’s legal guardians. After a battle with Dr. Doom, who turned out to be Victor’s Avengers A.I. friend, Doombot, Chase and Doombot fought over who would fix Victor with a new body, who's content to remain just a head.\n\nIn the first volume, Chase stole telescopic X-ray goggles and the Fistigons from his parents' secret laboratory. The X-ray goggles allowed Chase to see through clothing, walls, and even through miles of rock. The Fistigons were metal gauntlets with built-in flamethrowers. The gloves allowed the wearer to mentally shape the produced flame into any form the wearer desired. Before the final fight with their parents, Chase nearly drowned and was too weak to go on. He gave the Fistigons and X-ray goggles to Alex, who subsequently betrayed the team to their parents. Nico used the Staff of One to magically destroy the gauntlets while he was still wearing them, and the X-ray goggles were incinerated with Alex by the Gibborim. Chase has been known to use the Leapfrog (a frog-like land and sea transport designed by his parents, but mother's idea) and a switchblade.\n\nBefore Gert's death, she transferred telepathic control of Old Lace to Chase. He now shares an empathic link with the dinosaur, so both suffer from one another's injuries and benefit when the other heals. Chase and Old Lace's minds are also directly connected so the dinosaur can telepathically communicate thoughts and feelings to her master. Old Lace is engineered to follow Chase's every mental command though she can express dissatisfaction; to date, Old Lace has directly disobeyed only one of Chase's orders and was able to only with Karolina's help. Chase has also used Nico's Staff of One against Nico. Chase uses a time machine later in the series to travel through time. He returns shortly afterward with newly built Fistigons of his own design; to protect the team from the Yorkes' by conjuring fire and electricity to defeat them. And then protects the Leapfrog from a barrage of missiles by using the Fistigons to shoot out missiles of their own. In addition it was revealed that most of his father's devices are protected against magic, though obviously the first pair were not. In promotional art for upcoming \"Runaways\" issues, Chase is shown with a pair of rocket boots. In \"Runaways\" v3 #5, he calls them \"the Footstigons\".\n\nDuring the events of Avengers Arena, Chase obtained Darkhawk's powers, as the original owner was separated from the amulet. At the series' end, Chase returned the amulet to its original owner.\n\nGert dated Chase from \"Runaways\" volume 1, issue 16 to \"Runaways\" volume 2, issue 18. Their relationship was often defined by bickering - Chase's dim-witted moments often clashed with Gert's sarcastic and intelligent quips. Gert's relationship with Chase softened her somewhat, though she did not entirely lose her sarcastic edge. Their relationship developed quickly, with a few off-hand comments suggesting that they shared the same bed and were sexually intimate. However, their relationship was threatened when Gert learned that Nico had kissed Chase; though Chase rebuffed Nico's advances, Gert was still hurt that Chase had kept the interaction hidden from her. She revealed her insecurity about her appearance and fear that Chase would eventually leave her for a more conventionally pretty girl. Though implying she was hurt beyond reconciliation, she still ran into a burning building to save Chase from Geoffrey Wilder after their falling out. She bluffed some details about Chase's past to keep Geoffrey from sacrificing Chase and Geoffrey fell for the bluff, but plunged his dagger into Gert's stomach instead. As she lay dying, she transferred control of Old Lace to Chase and died forgiving Chase for Nico's kiss and without finishing saying she loved him.\n\nEver since the beginning of the series, Molly and Chase engage in a big brother/little sister relationship: they bicker, call each other names, and joke around. Chase had always stood up to protect Molly. After Gert's death, Chase's relationship with Molly turns into one of pure anger, prompting Chase to say in \"Civil War: Young Avengers/Runaways\" \"Molly why don't you $&!?ing grow up?!\" Their relationship is repaired by the end of the story arc when Chase expresses jealousy over Molly's growing attachment to the Young Avenger Speed, who tells him at the end of the story that no matter what, Molly looks up to him. Chase continues to be a father figure to Molly.\n\nNico provides the motherly and leadership foil for Chase's rule-breaking persona. The pair maintain a strong respect for each other despite often disagreeing over major group decisions, including Gert's burial site and allowing Victor Mancha to join the team. Chase cares for Nico's safety and well-being, as evidenced from when he comforted Nico after Karolina's departure and later when he took the Staff of One from Nico to destroy it (along with himself) and give her a normal life. Nico and Chase shared a kiss after Chase bluffed their way out of a potentially fatal encounter with inter-dimensional drug lord Pusher Man and managed to get a customer's name from the drug lord. Chase rejected the kiss but did not make a huge deal of it, even though Nico treated him more as an employee instead of a friend after the incident. After Gert's death, Chase and Nico's friendship strained as he allowed anger and grief to isolate him (both physically and emotionally) from the group's support. Nico was also the only person that Chase bid farewell before leaving to sacrifice himself for the Gibborim, which Nico interpreted as a cry for help, and is presumably a signal of the level of trust and respect Chase holds for Nico.. In Joss Whedon's stint on \"Runaways\", Chase and Nico's friendship appears more stable now that Chase seems to have moved past grieving for Gert. Their relationship became strained when Chase acted out frequently during Terry Moore's run on the series. However, their relationship stabilized and during Kathryn Immonen's run they were close once again. Especially, following the \"death\" of Old Lace, the two rekindled their relationship and shared an implied romantic moment to help then relieve their tension. He appears in the \"Runaways\" DLC.\n"}

{"id": "2111297", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2111297", "title": "San Carlos Nuevo Guaymas", "text": "San Carlos Nuevo Guaymas\n\nSan Carlos is a beachfront subdivision within the port city of Guaymas, in the northern state of Sonora in Mexico. It is noted for the exceptional clarity and warmth of the ocean water in its shallow bays. It lies on the Sea of Cortez. Given the size of the city, with nearly 7,000 inhabitants, there is a remarkable number of RV parks, resorts and stores. There is also a very large and active diving community.\n\nThere are also other outdoors activities like climbing, San Carlos is a beautiful place because it is an encounter of the desert with the sea, that gives life to many places to enjoy watching, like the most popular local mountain called \"cerro del tetakawi\", that in native Yaqui language means in English \"rocky mountain\", not only the mountain by itself is beautiful once its formed with rocks and desertic vegetation, but it is also an excellent option for those who enjoy climbing, and enjoying the view from the mountain top of this beautiful bay, and all the magic that surrounds it.\n\nThere are also many Americans and Canadians who live in San Carlos during the winter as the summer months are very hot and humid, much like Texas. There are many opportunities to fish, scuba dive, and relax on the beach.\n\nSan Carlos is about a six-hour drive from the United States along Mexican interstate Highway 15.\nAnother popular sport in San Carlos is sailing and it is the sailing capital of northern Baja.\n\nThe community of San Carlos was founded on lands that previously were a large cattle ranch known as the \"Baviso de Navarro\". This was later subdivided in four great estates known as Rancho Los Algodones, Rancho San Carlos, Rancho El Baviso and Rancho El Represo. In the mid-1950s, Mr. Rafael T. Caballero acquired the ranches Los Algodones, San Carlos and El Baviso, contracting the services of City planners who designed the first stages of a gradual and carefully planned tourist development that in time would become one of the first and most important tourist and recreational communities in the State.\n\nWhen the private investors began the initial works for this development, in support of this vision, the State Congress of Sonora during the governorship of Luis Encinas Johnson issued a declaration establishing the official incorporation of the Township of San Carlos, Nuevo Guaymas, Municipality of Guaymas, Sonora, Mexico, through a Decree published on 28 September 1963, with an endowment of 27.746 square kilometres of privately owned lands located in the Southern portion of the estate Ranch El Baviso.\n\nTo complement the Township Land Endowment, the State Congress, during the office of Governor Faustino Felix Serna, increased the Legal Land Fund by adding the estates known as Ranch San Carlos and Ranch Los Algodones, both with a surface of 22.04 km², as published in the Official State Bulletin no. 23, on 21 March 1973. A total of 49.79 km² of privately owned lands constitute the territorial reserves of this development.\n\nOn 1 July 1976, The Agrarian reform Secretariat, through the Director of Legal Affaires, declared by means of official notification no. 240-438155, Reference XV; that the mentioned privately owned lands located in the remaining lands of the estates El Baviso and San Carlos, have no agrarian legal claims upon them, and consequently the proprietors are free to lien, to encumber, to contribute to societies, to merge, to cede on trusteeship and to freely dispose of these lands. In that same official notice it is recognized that the proprietors of these four estates, voluntarily ceded to the Federal Government part of their lands for the creation of the new center of population and for the formation of the Ejido 13 July, affecting the Northern and the western portions of the estates San Carlos, El Baviso, Los Algodones and El Represo. The above in accordance to the Presidential Resolution of 15 July 1968, was published in the Official Gazette of the Federation on 27 August 1968.\n\nIn support of the objectives set forth by the private investors for the development of a new tourist destination, the Agrarian Reform Secretariat, the Secretary of Human Settlements and Public Works, and the Secretary of Tourism, altogether issued a Declaration of High-priority Tourist Zoning, for all the effects of law; in favor of the estates El Baviso, San Carlos and Los Algodones, owned by Grupo Caballero. The cited declaration was published in the Official Gazette of the Federation No. 34 on 15 August 1980.\n\nIn the State of Sonora as well as its personable cities and towns, is a diversity of 'real time' leisure attractions, as well as a strong historical perspective. Filled with great presidential traditions, Guaymas is the birthplace of three former Republic of Mexico presidents: Abelardo Rodriguez, Plutarco Elías Calles and Adolfo de la Huerta.\n\nSan Carlos has been used for many films, including:\n\n\nThe hotel/resorts of Club Med (now closed\n) and the San Carlos Plaza were built on beach frontage. A major alternative to the hotels in San Carlos are vacation rentals. \n\nThe waters of the Gulf of California in the San Carlos area offer a multitude of diving opportunities at all skill levels year-round. Average surface temperatures are 85°F(29.4°C)-90°F(32.2°C) (often even warmer) June–August, 80°F(26.6°C)-89°F(31.6°C) September and October, 63°F(17.2°C)-71°F(21.6°C) in the winter months November–March, Then warms-up again 72°F(22.2°C)-77°F(25°C) in April and May.\n\nUnderwater visibility of over 100 ft. (30m) is very common. Sometimes visibility exceeds 200 ft. (61 m) as is often the case at San Pedro Nolasco Island. However, a consultation with a local shop dive shop or divemaster is recommended, and can provide accurate and detailed information on current conditions at specific dive sites.\n\n"}
{"id": "2111299", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2111299", "title": "Condorcet loser criterion", "text": "Condorcet loser criterion\n\nIn single-winner voting system theory, the Condorcet loser criterion (CLC) is a measure for differentiating voting systems. It implies the majority loser criterion.\n\nA voting system complying with the Condorcet loser criterion will never allow a \"Condorcet loser\" to win. A Condorcet loser is a candidate who can be defeated in a head-to-head competition against each other candidate. (Not all elections will have a Condorcet loser since it is possible for three or more candidates to be mutually defeatable in different head-to-head competitions.)\n\nA slightly weaker (easier to pass) version is the majority Condorcet loser criterion (MCLC), which requires that a candidate who can be defeated \"by a majority\" in a head-to-head competition against each other candidate, lose. It is possible for a system, such as Majority Judgment, which allows voters not to state a preference between two candidates, to pass the MCLC but not the CLC.\n\nThe Smith criterion implies the Condorcet loser criterion, because no candidate in the Smith set can lose a head-to-head matchup against a candidate not in the Smith set.\n\nCompliant methods include: two-round system, instant-runoff voting (AV), contingent vote, borda count, Schulze method, ranked pairs, and Kemeny-Young method. Any voting method that ends in a runoff passes the criterion, so long as all voters are able to express their preferences in that runoff i.e. STAR voting passes only when voters can always indicate their ranked preference in their scores; if there are more than 6 candidates, then this is impossible.\n\nNoncompliant methods include: plurality voting, supplementary voting, Sri Lankan contingent voting, approval voting, range voting, Bucklin voting and minimax Condorcet.\n\nThe ballots for Approval voting do not contain the information to identify the Condorcet loser. Thus, Approval Voting cannot prevent the Condorcet loser from winning in some cases. The following example shows that Approval voting violates the Condorcet loser criterion.\n\nAssume four candidates A, B, C and L with 3 voters with the following preferences:\n\nThe Condorcet loser is L, since every other candidate is preferred to him by 2 out of 3 voters.\n\nThere are several possibilities how the voters could translate their preference order into an approval ballot, i.e. where they set the threshold between approvals and disapprovals. For example, the first voter could approve (i) only A or (ii) A and B or (iii) A, B and L or (iv) all candidates or (v) none of them. Let's assume, that all voters approve three candidates and disapprove only the last one. The approval ballots would be:\nResult: L is approved by all three voters, whereas the three other candidates are approved by only two voters. Thus, the Condorcet loser L is elected Approval winner.\n\nNote, that if any voter would set the threshold between approvals and disapprovals at any other place, the Condorcet loser L would not be the (single) Approval winner. However, since Approval voting elects the Condorcet loser in the example, Approval voting fails the Condorcet loser criterion.\n\nThis example shows that Majority Judgment violates the Condorcet loser criterion. Assume three candidates A, B and L and 3 voters with the following opinions:\nThe sorted ratings would be as follows:\nL has the median rating \"Good\", A has the median rating \"Fair\" and B has the median rating \"Poor\". Thus, L is the Majority Judgment winner.\n\nNow, the Condorcet loser is determined. If all informations are removed that are not considered to determine the Condorcet loser, we have:\n\nA is preferred over L by two voters and B is preferred over L by two voters. Thus, L is the Condorcet loser.\n\nResult: L is the Condorcet loser. However, while the voter least preferring L also rates A and B relatively low, the other two voters rate L close to their favorites. Thus, L is elected Majority Judgment winner. Hence, Majority Judgment fails the Condorcet loser criterion.\n\nThis example shows that the Minimax method violates the Condorcet loser criterion. Assume four candidates A, B, C and L with 9 voters with the following preferences:\nSince all preferences are strict rankings (no equals are present), all three Minimax methods (winning votes, margins and pairwise opposite) elect the same winners:\n\nResult: L loses against all other candidates and, thus, is Condorcet loser. However, the candidates A, B and C form a cycle with clear defeats. L benefits from that since it loses relatively closely against all three and therefore L's biggest defeat is the closest of all candidates. Thus, the Condorcet loser L is elected Minimax winner. Hence, the Minimax method fails the Condorcet loser criterion.\n\nHere, Memphis has a plurality (42%) of the first preferences, so would be the winner under simple plurality voting. However, the majority (58%) of voters have Memphis as their \"fourth\" preference, and if two of the remaining three cities were not in the running to become the capital, Memphis would lose all of the contests 58–42. Hence, Memphis is the Condorcet loser.\n\nThis example shows that Range voting violates the Condorcet loser criterion. Assume two candidates A and L and 3 voters with the following opinions:\n\nThe total scores would be:\n\nHence, L is the Range voting winner.\n\nNow, the Condorcet loser is determined. If all informations are removed that are not considered to determine the Condorcet loser, we have:\n\nThus, L would be the Condorcet loser.\n\nResult: L is preferred only by one of the three voters, so L is the Condorcet loser. However, while the two voters preferring A over L rate both candidates nearly equal and L's supporter rates him clearly over A, L is elected Range voting winner. Hence, Range voting fails the Condorcet loser criterion.\n\n"}

Countries with congressional districts include the United States, the Philippines, and Japan. A congressional district is based on population, which, in the United States, is taken using a census every ten years.\n\nThere are 435 congressional districts in the United States House of Representatives, with each one representing approximately 710,000 people. In addition to 435 congressional districts, the five inhabited U.S. territories and the federal district of Washington, D.C. each send a non-voting delegate to the House of Representatives. The Census Bureau within the United States Department of Commerce conducts a decennial census whose figures are used to determine the number of Representatives that each state sends to Congress, and therefore the number of congressional districts within each state. The borders of those districts are set by the states, and within each state all districts are required to have approximately equal populations (see \"Wesberry v. Sanders\"). The 2012 elections were the first to be based on the congressional districts which were defined based on the 2010 Census data.\n\n"}

Other common sources are fuming silver, gold, platinum, chromium (from stainless steel), nickel, arsenic, manganese, beryllium, cadmium, cobalt, lead, selenium, and zinc.\n\nWelders are commonly exposed to the substances that cause metal fume fever from the base metal, plating, or filler. Brazing and soldering can also cause metal poisoning due to exposure to lead, zinc, copper, or cadmium. In extreme cases, cadmium (present in some older silver solder alloys) can cause loss of consciousness.\n\nThe signs and symptoms are generally flu-like. They include fever, chills, nausea, headache, fatigue, muscle aches, joint pains, lack of appetite, shortness of breath, pneumonia, chest pain, change in blood pressure, dizziness, and coughing. A sweet or metallic taste in the mouth may also be reported, along with a dry or irritated throat which may lead to hoarseness. Symptoms of a more severe metal toxicity may also include a burning sensation in the body, shock, no urine output, collapse, convulsions, shortness of breath, yellow eyes or yellow skin, rash, vomiting, watery or bloody diarrhea or low or high blood pressure, which require prompt medical attention. \n\nMetal fume fever is due to the inhalation of certain metals, either as fine dust or most commonly as fumes. Simple metal compounds such as oxides are equally capable of causing it. The effects of particularly toxic compounds, such as nickel carbonyl, are not considered merely metal fume fever.\n\nExposure usually arises through hot metalworking processes, such as smelting and casting of zinc alloys, welding of galvanized metals, brazing, or soldering. If the metal concerned is particularly high-risk, the residue from cold sanding processes may also cause fume fever, even if the dose is lower. It may also be caused by electroplated surfaces or metal-rich anti-corrosion paint, such as cadmium passivated steel or zinc chromate primer on aluminium aircraft parts. Exposure has also been reported in use of lead-free ammunition, by the harder steel core stripping metal from the jacket of the bullet and barrel of the rifle.\n\nThe most plausible metabolic source of the symptoms is a dose-dependent release of certain cytokines, an event which occurs by inhaling metal oxide fumes that injure the lung cells. This is not an allergic reaction, though allergic reactions to metal fumes can occur.\n\nDiagnosis is primarily anecdotal, that is, it depends upon a good occupational history. Diagnosis of metal fume fever can be easily missed because the complaints are non-specific, resemble a number of other common illnesses, and presentation occurs typically 2–4 hours after the exposure. When respiratory symptoms are prominent, metal fume fever may be confused with acute bronchitis or pneumonia. The diagnosis is based primarily upon a history of exposure to metal oxide fumes. Cain and Fletcher (2010) report a case of metal fume fever that was diagnosed only by taking a full occupational history and by close collaboration between primary and secondary health care personnel.\n\nPhysical symptoms vary among persons exposed, depending largely upon the stage in the course of the syndrome during which examination occurs. Patients may present with wheezing or crackles in the lungs. They typically have an increased white blood cell count, and urine, blood plasma and skin zinc levels may (unsurprisingly) be elevated. Chest X-ray abnormalities may also be present.\n\nAn interesting feature of metal fume fever involves rapid adaptation to the development of the syndrome following repeated metal oxide exposure. Workers with a history of recurrent metal fume fever often develop a tolerance to the fumes. This tolerance, however, is transient, and only persists through the work week. After a weekend hiatus, the tolerance has usually disappeared. This phenomenon of tolerance is what led to the name \"Monday Fever\".\n\nIn 2018, there were 259 cases of metal fume fever reported to the United States Poison Control Center.\n\nTreatment of mild metal fume fever consists of bedrest, keeping the patient well hydrated, and symptomatic therapy (e.g. aspirin for headaches) as indicated. In the case of non-allergic acute lung injury, standard or recommended approaches to treatment have not been defined.\n\nThe consumption of large quantities of cow's milk, either before or immediately after exposure is a traditional remedy. However, the United Kingdom Health and Safety Executive challenges this advice, warning, \"Don’t believe the stories about drinking milk before welding. It does not prevent you getting metal fume fever.\"\n\nPrevention of metal fume fever in workers who are at risk (such as welders) involves avoidance of direct contact with potentially toxic fumes, improved engineering controls (exhaust ventilation systems), personal protective equipment (respirators), and education of workers regarding the features of the syndrome itself and proactive measures to prevent its development.\n\nIn some cases, the product's design may be changed so as to eliminate the use of risky metals. Cadmium is often replaced by other metals. NiCd rechargeable batteries are being replaced by NiMH. These contain other toxic metals, such as chromium, vanadium and cerium. Zinc or nickel plating can be used instead of cadmium plating, and brazing filler alloys now rarely contain cadmium.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2111318", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2111318", "title": "I Walked with a Zombie", "text": "I Walked with a Zombie\n\nI Walked with a Zombie is a 1943 American horror film directed by Jacques Tourneur, and starring James Ellison, Frances Dee, and Tom Conway. Its plot follows a nurse who travels to care for the ailing wife of a sugar plantation owner in the Caribbean, where she encounters supernatural phenomena such as voodoo and the walking dead. The screenplay is based on an article of the same name by Inez Wallace, and also partly reinterprets the narrative of the 1847 novel \"Jane Eyre\" by Charlotte Brontë. It was the second horror film from producer Val Lewton for RKO Pictures.\n\nBetsy Connell (Frances Dee), a Canadian nurse, relates in a voiceover how she once \"walked with a zombie.\"\n\nBetsy is hired to care for the wife of Paul Holland (Tom Conway), a sugar plantation owner on the Caribbean island of Saint Sebastian. Saint Sebastian is home to a small white community and descendants of African slaves. On the way to the plantation, the black driver tells Betsy that the Hollands brought slaves to the island, and that the statue of \"Ti-Misery\" (Saint Sebastian pierced by arrows) in the courtyard is the figurehead from a slave ship.\n\nAt dinner, Betsy meets Paul's half-brother and employee, Wesley Rand (James Ellison), who clearly resents Paul. While getting ready for bed, Betsy hears crying. When she investigates, a woman in a white robe walks towards her, her eyes staring. Betsy screams, waking everyone. Paul takes charge of Jessica Holland, the woman Betsy is to care for. The next morning, Dr. Maxwell tells Betsy that Jessica's spinal cord was irreparably damaged by a serious illness, leaving her totally without the willpower to do anything for herself.\n\nOn her day off, Betsy encounters Wesley in town. While he drinks himself into a stupor, a calypso singer (Sir Lancelot) sings about how Jessica was going to run away with Wesley, but Paul would not let them go. Then she was struck down by the fever. Betsy meets Mrs. Rand (Edith Barrett), Paul and Wesley's doctor mother.\n\nThat night, at dinner, Paul tries to persuade Wesley to reduce his drinking (at Betsy's suggestion), but he accuses Paul of trying to impress Betsy and of driving Jessica insane in the first place.\n\nLater, Betsy is drawn to the sound of Paul playing the piano. He apologizes for bringing her to the island and admits that he may have been the cause of his wife's condition. Betsy has been falling in love with her moody employer. She determines to make him happy by curing Jessica.\n\nBetsy gets Paul to agree to try a potentially fatal insulin shock treatment on Jessica, but it has no effect. Housemaid Alma (Theresa Harris) then tells her that a voodoo priest cured a woman of a similar condition. Betsy takes her patient without permission through cane fields past a crossroads guarded by an eerie Carre-Four (a reference to the loa Maitre Carrefours) to the houmfort (a place where voodoo worshipers gather).\n\nThere, they watch a man (the Sabreur) wield a saber during a ritual. People are given advice through a shack door by a voodoo priest. Betsy is shocked to find that the priest is Mrs. Rand. Mrs. Rand explains that she uses voodoo to convince the natives to accept conventional medical practices and tells Betsy that Jessica is incurable. Outside, the locals stab Jessica in the arm with the sword as a test. When she does not bleed, they are convinced she is a zombie.\n\nBetsy takes her home. Paul is furious, but is moved when he realizes that Betsy was trying to cure Jessica. The local authorities investigate the next day, and the natives demand that Jessica be returned to them for \"ritual tests\". Later, Carre-Four approaches the residence, but Mrs. Rand orders him to leave.\n\nPaul suggests that Betsy return to Canada, regretting entangling her in his family problems and fearful of demeaning and abusing her as he did Jessica. Betsy reluctantly agrees.\n\nThe next day, Doctor Maxwell reports that the unrest has sparked an official inquiry into Jessica's illness. Mrs. Rand shocks everyone by claiming that Jessica is a zombie. Although she had never taken voodoo seriously before, Mrs Rand reveals that when she discovered that Jessica was planning to run away with Wesley and break up her family, she felt herself possessed by a voodoo god. She then put a curse on Jessica. Paul, Maxwell and Betsy dismiss her story, but Wesley becomes obsessed with freeing Jessica. He asks Betsy if she would consider euthanasia, but she refuses.\n\nUsing an effigy of Jessica, the Sabreur draws her to him from afar. Paul and Betsy stop her, but they are not around when he tries again. Wesley opens the gate, letting Jessica out. Then he pulls an arrow out of the statue of Ti-Misery and follows. As the Sabreur stabs the doll with a pin, Wesley thrusts the arrow into Jessica. He then carries her body into the sea, pursued slowly by Carre-Four. Later, the natives discover the bodies of Jessica and Wesley floating in the surf.\n\n\nProducer Val Lewton was obligated to use the film's title by RKO executives, which they had culled from an article of the same name written by Inez Wallace for \"American Weekly Magazine.\" Wallace's article detailed her own experience meeting \"zombies\" not the literal living dead, but rather people she had encountered working on a plantation in Haiti whose vocal cords and cognitive abilities had been impaired by drug use, rendering them obedient servants who understood and followed simple orders.\n\nIn devising the screenplay, Lewton asked his writers to use Charlotte Brontë's \"Jane Eyre\" as a model for its narrative structure, and to undertake research on Haitian voodoo practices. Lewton purportedly proclaimed that he wanted to make a \"West Indian version of \"Jane Eyre\".\" Screenwriters Curt Siodmak and Ardel Wray were appointed to write the script; Siodmak's original draft revolved around the wife of a plantation owner who is made into a zombie to prevent her from leaving to Paris, but the screenplay underwent significant revisions by Wray and Lewton.\n\nAnna Lee was originally slated for the Frances Dee role, but had to bow out due to another commitment.\n\nPrincipal photography for \"I Walked with a Zombie\" began October 26, 1942. Wray described the film as being shot on a \"shoestring budget.\" Shooting was completed less than one month later on November 19.\n\n\"I Walked with a Zombie\" had its theatrical premiere in Cleveland, Ohio in April 1943, the hometown of the source material's author, Inez Wallace. It opened in New York City on April 21, 1943, before expanding wide on April 30. It continued to screen in North American theaters throughout the year, with screenings beginning as late as December 19, 1943 in Casper, Wyoming.\n\nThe film was re-released in the United States through RKO in 1956, opening in Los Angeles in July of that year. It continued to screen throughout the country during the fall of 1956, into late December.\n\nThe film was released on DVD in 2005 by Warner Home Video as a double-feature disc with \"The Body Snatcher\" (1945). This disc was featured in a Val Lewton box set released the same year.\n\nInitial reception for \"I Walked with a Zombie\" was mixed. \n\"The New York Times\" was critical of the film, calling it \" a dull, disgusting exaggeration of an unhealthy, abnormal concept of life\". Wanda Hale of the \"New York Daily News\" praised it as a \"spine-chilling horror film,\" awarding it two-and-a-half out of three stars. A critic of \"The Boston Globe\" felt the film \"gets nowhere in the telling and finishes its overdone melodramatics with a most unconvincing climax.\" A reviewer in Albany, New York thought it well-suited for its likely viewers: \"rigs up a great atmosphere for the haunt and holler audience and, compared with 'Cat People,' the movie with which it is mentioned most often in publicity, it is a success.\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, \"I Walked with a Zombie\" holds an approval rating of 92%, based on 26 reviews, and an average rating of 8.1/10. It's consensus reads, \"Evocative direction by Jacques Tourneur collides with the low-rent production values of exploitateer Val Lewton in \"I Walked with a Zombie\", a sultry sleeper that's simultaneously smarmy, eloquent and fascinating.\"\n\nAuthor and film critic Leonard Maltin rated the film three and a half out of four stars, praising the film's atmosphere and story, calling it \"[an] Exceptional Val Lewton chiller\". Dennis Schwartz of \"Ozus' World Movie Reviews\" awarded the film a grade A, praising the film's atmosphere, Tourneur's direction, and story. TV Guide awarded the film their highest rating of 5/5 stars, calling it \"an unqualified horror masterpiece\". Alan Jones from \"Radio Times\" gave the film four out of five stars, writing, \"Jacques Tourneur's direction creates palpable fear and tension in a typically low-key nightmare from the Lewton fright factory. The lighting, shadows, exotic setting and music all contribute to the immensely disturbing atmosphere, making this stunning piece of poetic horror a classic of the genre.\"\n\nIn 2007, \"Stylus Magazine\" named it the fifth best zombie movie of all time.\n\n\n"}

At just over one millimeter in length, its purpose is to stabilize the smallest bone in the body, the stapes.\n\nThe stapedius emerges from a pinpoint foramen in the apex of the pyramidal eminence (a hollow, cone-shaped prominence in the posterior wall of the tympanic cavity), and inserts into the neck of the stapes. \n\nThe stapedius is supplied by the nerve to stapedius, a branch of the facial nerve. \n\nThe stapedius dampens the vibrations of the stapes by pulling on the neck of that bone. As one of the muscles involved in the acoustic reflex it prevents excess movement of the stapes, helping to control the amplitude of sound waves from the general external environment to the inner ear. \n\nParalysis of the stapedius allows wider oscillation of the stapes, resulting in heightened reaction of the auditory ossicles to sound vibration. This condition, known as hyperacusis, causes normal sounds to be perceived as very loud. Paralysis of the stapedius muscle may result when the nerve to the stapedius, a branch of the facial nerve, is damaged, or when the facial nerve itself is damaged before the nerve to stapedius branches. In cases of Bell's palsy, a unilateral paralysis of the facial nerve, the stapedius is paralyzed and hyperacusis may result.\n\nLike the stapes bone to which it attaches, the stapedius muscle shares evolutionary history with other vertebrate structures.\n\nThe mammalian stapedius evolved from a muscle called the depressor mandibulae in other tetrapods, the function of which was to open the jaws (this function was taken over by the digastric muscle in mammals). The depressor mandibulae arose from the levator operculi in bony fish, and is equivalent to the epihyoidean in sharks. Like the stapedius, all of these muscles derive from the hyoid arch and are innervated by cranial nerve VII.\n\n"}

He has been named Manager of the Year three times, most recently in 2018. He is currently the longest-tenured manager in the MLB. During a 10-year playing career from 1985 through 1994, Melvin was a catcher for the Detroit Tigers, San Francisco Giants, Baltimore Orioles, Kansas City Royals, Boston Red Sox, New York Yankees, and Chicago White Sox. \n\nIn his managing career Melvin has led the Seattle Mariners (2003–04), Arizona Diamondbacks (2005–09), and Oakland Athletics (2011–present). Melvin was named the National League Manager of the Year in 2007, and the American League Manager of the Year in both 2012 (becoming the 6th manager in history to win the award in both leagues) and in 2018 (becoming the 8th manager ever to win the award three or more times in a career). Through 2019, his 731 Oakland wins were third-most in team history (behind Connie Mack and Tony La Russa), and he had an aggregate career record of 1,224-1,172 (.511) in 16 seasons as a Major League manager.\n\nEntering the 2020 MLB season, Melvin is the longest tenured manager in MLB with the same team after the retirement of Bruce Bochy, the long time manager of the San Francisco Giants, at the conclusion of the 2019 MLB season.\n\nMelvin was born in Palo Alto, California, to Judy and Paul Melvin, and grew up in Menlo Park, California. He is Jewish, the son of a Jewish mother and a Catholic father. Through 2018, he was one of seven Jewish managers in MLB history. The others were Gabe Kapler, Brad Ausmus, Jeff Newman, Norm Sherry, Lou Boudreau, and Lipman Pike. Melvin's grandfather, R.B. \"Bud\" Levitas, was the original ballboy in the 1920s for the Acme Packers (precursor to the Green Bay Packers).\n\nHe resides in Berkeley, California, and in Greenwich Village in New York City, with his wife, Kelley, whom Melvin met in 1982 when he was 21 years of age. They have one daughter, Alexi (born December 21, 1988), who is an actress, writer, and filmmaker. Melvin and his family are very actively involved with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation; Alexi was diagnosed with juvenile diabetes at age 14.\n\nAfter attending Laurel and Encinal elementary schools in Menlo Park, Melvin played baseball (at catcher), basketball (at forward), and golf at Menlo-Atherton High School in Atherton, south of San Francisco, graduating in 1979. He batted .474 with 11 home runs for the baseball team, including .529 his senior year when he was named to the \"San Jose Mercury News\"' All-Central Coast Section baseball team. He was the first student inducted into the school's Hall of Fame. \n\nMelvin then enrolled at the University of California in Berkeley, and played catcher for the Golden Bears. As a freshman, he helped lead Cal to a 44–23–1 () record and a third-place finish at the College World Series in 1980. Melvin finished his freshman season batting .269 with two doubles and 12 RBIs in 67 at bats over 29 games.\n\nFollowing his freshman year at California, Melvin transferred to Cañada College in Redwood City, California. He played fall ball for the baseball team.\n\nBobby Melvin was then selected in the 1st round (2nd pick) by the Detroit Tigers in the secondary phase of the 1981 draft. He debuted in the major leagues on May 25, 1985, at the age of 23. He played 11 seasons, mostly as a back-up catcher, for the Tigers, San Francisco Giants, Baltimore Orioles, Kansas City Royals, Boston Red Sox, New York Yankees, and Chicago White Sox. As a Tiger, he backed up Lance Parrish, and as a Giant, he served as the backup for fellow catcher Bob Brenly, who, like him, went on to manage the Diamondbacks. During his winters in San Francisco, he interned at Bear Stearns.\n\nIn 1987, he caught stealing 42.9% of attempted base-stealers, second-best in the National League. In 1991, Melvin turned five double plays at catcher, fifth-most in the American League, despite playing in only 79 games. Melvin finished his career with a batting average of .233, and 35 home runs.\n\nMelvin worked for Milwaukee as a scout in 1996, roving instructor in 1997, and assistant to General Manager Sal Bando in 1998. He began his coaching career as Manager Phil Garner's bench coach from 1999-2000, first with the Brewers in 1999 wearing #12 (during which time he also managed the Maryvale team in the Arizona Fall League), and then in 2000 with the Tigers, wearing #15. He was inducted into the AFL Hall of Fame in 2013. Melvin then was Bob Brenly's bench coach with the Diamondbacks from 2001-02 wearing #3, when the team won two NL West titles, as well as the World Series in 2001.\n\nMelvin managed the Seattle Mariners in 2003 and 2004 Wearing #3, following the ten-year run of Lou Piniella. The M's won 93 games with a .574 win-loss percentage in 2003, as the 93 wins tied Melvin for the 15th-most by any rookie manager in Major League history. However, the team missed the playoffs, finishing three games behind Oakland in the division, and two behind Boston for the one wild card spot.\n\nThe following season was less successful, as the Mariners lost 99 games in 2004, and Melvin's contract was not extended. He finished with a 156–168 career record (.481) as Mariners manager. He returned to the Diamondbacks for whom he previously had been bench coach before being hired by the Mariners.\n\nMelvin was the second manager the Diamondbacks hired for 2005, after they fired Wally Backman before he managed a single game due to revelations of his past arrests and serious financial troubles. Melvin led the team on a 26-game improvement from a franchise-worst 51-111 mark in 2004, as the team finished 2005 with a record of 77-85.\n\nMelvin led Arizona to a National League West title in 2007 with a record of 90–72, and a .556 win-loss percentage. The Diamondbacks entered the playoffs as the No. 1 seed in the National League. They swept the Chicago Cubs in the NLDS, but then were swept themselves in the NLCS by the Colorado Rockies. \n\nMelvin was named National League Sporting News Manager of the Year and MLB Manager of the Year for 2007. His nickname was \"The Mad Scientist,\" because of his mental approach to the game.\n\nOn August 14, 2008, with his 304th win Melvin became the winningest manager in Arizona history, passing Bob Brenly. \nMelvin wore #3 as Manager with the Diamondbacks, the same number he wore with them when he was bench coach from 2001-2002.\n\nMelvin was fired as manager and replaced by A.J. Hinch, another former catcher, after the May 8, 2009, game. Melvin finished with a 337–340 regular season record as Diamondbacks manager, and a 3–4 post–season record. \n\nFollowing the 2009 season, Melvin was a candidate to be the next manager of the Houston Astros. However, the position was filled by Brad Mills. He was interviewed by the Milwaukee Brewers for their managerial opening in October 2010, and was believed to be a finalist along with Bobby Valentine, Joey Cora, and Ron Roenicke. The position eventually went to Roenicke, then the Angels' bench coach. He was then interviewed by the New York Mets for their managerial opening before the 2011 season, but the position eventually was awarded to former Astros and Angels manager Terry Collins.\n\nIn 2010, Melvin was a scout for the New York Mets, and in May 2011 he worked for the Diamondbacks as a special baseball advisor to President & CEO Derrick Hall.\n\nOn June 9, 2011, Melvin was named interim manager of the Oakland Athletics following Bob Geren's dismissal, Melvin has worn #6 since becoming manager. On September 21, he was given the managerial position on a permanent basis, with a three-year contract extension, and became the 30th manager in franchise history, and the 18th in Oakland history. The Athletics fashioned a 47–52 record under Melvin's watch, and a 74–88 overall finish to 2011. \n\nMelvin went on the \"Chris Townsend Show\" in the Bay Area after the first game of the 2012 season in Tokyo, and promised the fans that the A's would work hard every game. He managed the A's to the franchise's best-ever record in July at 19–5. On October 1, the A's clinched their first playoff appearance since 2006, and two days later clinched the Western Division of the American League. For the regular season, the team was 94-68, a .580 win-loss percentage. The A's lost the 2012 ALDS to the Detroit Tigers, three games to two. \n\nMelvin was honored as the 2012 American League Manager of the Year. He became the 14th manager in history to win the award at least twice in a career, and the sixth manager to win the award in both leagues.\n\nDuring the 2013 season, Melvin's second full season at the helm, the A's continued what began the previous year, posting winning records for every month of the season and securing a second consecutive AL West Division Championship. Athletics' outfielder Josh Reddick referred to Melvin as the \"King of Platoons\" due to his extensive use of platoons. In the 2013 regular season, the team was 96-66 with a .593 win-loss percentage.\n\nIn 2014, Melvin's Athletics entered the All-Star Break with the best record in the majors. While the team faded down the stretch, it still managed to clinch an AL Wild Card berth on the final day of the season. \n\nOn July 29, 2017, he became the 64th MLB manager to win 1,000 games in his career. On September 28, 2017, the A's and Melvin agreed to extend his contract through the 2019 season. On October 29, 2018, the A's awarded Melvin a long-term contract extension, through 2021 with a club option for 2022.\n\nOn November 13, 2018, Melvin won his third Manager of the Year award, becoming just the 8th manager in MLB history win the award three times. He won the award after leading the baseball team with the lowest Opening Day payroll to a 97-65 record and its first post-season in four years. \n\nAs of 2019, his 731 wins with the A's were third-most in team history, behind only Hall of Fame managers Connie Mack and Tony La Russa, and his 1,224 wins ranked 44th in MLB history.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2111368", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2111368", "title": "Hindu law", "text": "Hindu law\n\nHindu law, as a historical term, refers to the code of laws applied to Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs in British India. Hindu law, in modern scholarship, also refers to the legal theory, jurisprudence and philosophical reflections on the nature of law discovered in ancient and medieval era Indian texts. It is one of the oldest known jurisprudence theories in the world.\n\nHindu tradition, in its surviving ancient texts, does not universally express the law in the canonical sense of \"ius\" or of \"lex\". The ancient term in Indian texts is Dharma, which means more than a code of law, though collections of legal maxims were compiled into works such as the Nāradasmṛti. The term \"Hindu law\" is a colonial construction, and emerged after the colonial rule arrived in South Asia, and when in 1772 it was decided by British colonial officials, that European common law system would not be implemented in India, that Hindus of India would be ruled under their \"Hindu law\" and Muslims of India would be ruled under \"Muslim law\" (Sharia).\n\nPrior to the British colonial rule, Muslim law was codified as \"Fatawa-e-Alamgiri\", Theravada Buddhism in the 13th century, Manusmriti derived, Wareru Dhammathat, Jayasthiti Malla’s, also Manusmriti rooted, 14th century Manav Nyaya Shastra, for what would become predominantly Hindu Nepal, as was the Kuṭāra-Mānawa of Java; Ngawang Namgyal’s 17th century, Tibetan Buddhism based, Tsa Yig Chenmo of Bhutan, with the Dutch codifying Tamil customarily law in the Thesavalamai, but elsewhere separate laws for non-Muslims – such as Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jains, Parsis – were not codified during the 601 years of Islamic Mughal and Sultanate rule. The substance of Hindu law implemented by the British was derived from a Dharmaśāstra named Manusmriti, one of the many treatises (śāstra) on \"Dharma\". The British, however, mistook the Dharmaśāstra as codes of law and failed to recognise that these Sanskrit texts were not used as statements of positive law until the British colonial officials chose to do so. Rather, Dharmaśāstra contained jurisprudence commentary, i.e., a theoretical reflection upon practical law, but not a statement of the law of the land as such. Scholars have also questioned the authenticity and the corruption in the Manusmriti manuscript used to derive the colonial era Hindu law.\n\nIn colonial history context, the construction and implementation of Hindu law and Islamic law was an attempt at \"legal pluralism\" during the British colonial era, where people in the same region were subjected to different civil and criminal laws based on the religion of the plaintiff and defendant. Legal scholars state that this divided the Indian society, and that Indian law and politics have ever since vacillated between \"legal pluralism - the notion that religion is the basic unit of society and different religions must have different legal rights and obligations\" and \"legal universalism – the notion that individuals are the basic unit of society and all citizens must have uniform legal rights and obligations\".\n\nIn Hinduism, law is discussed as a subset of \"dharma\" which signifies behaviors that are considered in accord with \"rta\", the order that makes life and the universe possible, and includes duties, rights, laws, conduct, virtues and ‘‘right way of living’’. The concept of \"Dharma\" includes Hindu law.\n\nIn ancient texts of Hinduism, the concept of dharma incorporates the principles of law, order, harmony, and truth. It is explained as the necessary law of life and equated to \"satya\" (Sanskrit: सत्यं, truth), in hymn 1.4.14 of Brhadaranyaka Upanishad, as follows:\n\nIn ancient Hindu jurisprudence texts, a number of Sanskrit words refer to aspects of law. Some of these include \"Niyama\" (Sanskrit: नियम, rule), \"Nyaya\" (न्याय, justice), \"Yuktata\" (युक्तता, justice), \"Samya\" (साम्य, equality and impartiality in law), \"Vidhi\" (विधि, precept or rule), \"Vyavastha\" (व्यवस्था, regulation), \"Sambhasa\" (सम्भाषा, contract or mutual engagement), \"Prasamvida-patra\" (प्रसंविदा-पत्र, written contract), \"Vivadayati\" (विवादयति, litigate or dispute), \"Adhivakta\" (अधिवक्ता, lawyer), \"Nyayavadi\" (न्यायवादी, male lawyer), \"Nyayavadini\" (न्यायवादिनी, female lawyer), \"Nyayadata\" (न्यायदाता, judge), \"Danda\" (दण्ड, punishment, penalty or fine), among others.\n\nJohn Mayne, in 1910, wrote that the classical Hindu law has the oldest pedigree of any known system of jurisprudence. Mayne noted that while being ancient, the conflicting texts on almost every question presents a great difficulty in deciding what the classical Hindu law was. As more literature emerges, and is translated or interpreted, Mayne noted that the conflict between the texts on every matter of law has multiplied, and that there is a lack of consensus between the Western legal scholars resident in India.\n\nLudo Rocher states that Hindu tradition does not express law in the sense of \"ius\" nor of \"lex\". The term \"Hindu law\" is a colonial construction, and emerged when the colonial rule arrived in South Asia, and when in 1772 it was decided by British colonial officials in consultation with Mughal rulers, that European common law system would not be implemented in India, that Hindus of India would be ruled under their \"Hindu law\" and Muslims of India would be ruled under sharia (Muslim law). However, Hindu law was neither mentioned, nor in use, nor codified, during the 600 years of Islamic rule of India. An attempt was made to find any old surviving Sanskrit text that mentioned elements of law, and this is how Western editors and translators arrived at the equation that \"dharma shastra equals lawbook, code or Institute\", states Rocher.\n\nScholars such as Derrett, Menski and others have repeatedly asked whether and what evidence there is that the Dharmasastras were the actual legal authority before and during the Islamic rule in India. They have also questioned whether the Dharmasastras contain \"precepts\" or \"recommendations\", that is whether the jurisprudence mentioned in Dharmasastras was actually ever used in disputes in Indian society. Early scholars during the British colonial rule such as John Mayne suggested that it is probable that Dharma-smriti texts reflect the \"practical administration of law\", at least before the arrival of Islam in India. However, most later scholars state that Dharma texts of Hinduism are \"purely or mostly concerned with moral and religious norms which have some but not a very close relationship to legal practice\". A few scholars have suggested that the Dharma-related Smritis such as Manusmriti, Naradasmriti and Parashara Smriti do not embody the Hindu law but are commentaries and scholarly notes on more ancient authoritative legal texts that have been lost or yet to be found.\n\nClassical Hindu law, states Donald Davis, \"represents one of the least known, yet most sophisticated traditions of legal theory and jurisprudence in world history. Hindu jurisprudential texts contain elaborate and careful philosophical reflections on the nature of law and religion. The nature of Hindu law as a tradition has been subject to some debate and some misunderstanding both within and especially outside of specialist circles.\"\n\nIn South India, temples were intimately involved in the administration of law.\n\n\"Śruti\" have been considered as the authority in the Hindu Dharma. The \"Smritis\", such as Manusmriti, Naradasmriti and Parashara Smriti, contribute to the exposition of the Hindu Dharma but are considered less authoritative than \"Śrutis\" (the Vedic corpus that includes early Upanishads). The root texts of ancient Hindu jurisprudence and law are the \"Dharma-sūtras\". These express that the Shruti, Smriti and Achara are sources of jurisprudence and law. The precedence of these sources is declared in the opening verses of each of the known, surviving Dharma-sūtras. For example,\nThe \"Smritis\", such as Manusmriti, Naradasmriti, Yajnavalkya Smrti and Parashara Smriti, expanded this definition, as follows,\n\nAs a source of \"Dharma\", only three of the four types of texts in the Vedas have behavioral precepts. Lingat notes (abridged),\n\nBilimoria states the role of \"Shruti\" in Hindu Dharma has been inspired by \"the belief in a higher natural cosmic order (\"Rta\" succeeded later by the concept \"Dharma\") that regulates the universe and provides the basis for its growth, flourishing and sustenance – be that of the gods, human beings, animals and eco-formations\".\n\nLevinson states that the role of \"Shruti\" and \"Smriti\" in Hindu law is as a source of guidance, and its tradition cultivates the principle that \"the facts and circumstances of any particular case determine what is good or bad\". The later Hindu texts include fourfold sources of \"Dharma\", states Levinson, which include \"Atmanastushti\" (satisfaction of one's conscience), \"Sadachara\" (local norms of virtuous individuals), \"Smriti\" and \"Sruti\".\n\nWhile texts on ancient Hindu law have not survived, texts that confirm the existence of the institution of lawyers in ancient India have. The Sanskrit text \"Vivadarnavasetu\", in Chapter 3, for example, states,\nAncient texts of the Hindu tradition formulate and articulate punishment. These texts from the last 2500 years, states Terence Day, imply or recognize key elements in their theories of fair punishment: (1) the texts set a standard of Right, in order to define a violation that warrants punishment; (2) they discuss the possibility of a violation thereby defining a wrongdoing; (3) they discuss a theory of responsibility and assignability of a wrongdoing; (4) the texts discuss degrees of guilt, and therewith the form and severity of punishment must match the transgression; (5) they discuss approved and authorized forms of punishments and how these may be properly administered. The goal of punishment, in Hindu law, has been retributive and reformative. Hindu law, states Sarkar, developed the theory of punishment from its foundational theory of what it believed was necessary for the prosperity of the individual and a collection of individuals, of state and non-state.\n\nThere are wide variations in the statement of crime and associated punishment in different texts. Some texts for example discuss punishment for crimes such as murder, without mentioning the gender, class or caste of the plaintiff or defendant, while some discuss and differentiate the crime based on gender, class or caste. It is unclear, states Terence Day, whether these were part of the original, because the stylistic, structural and substantive evidence such as inconsistencies between versions of different manuscripts of the same text suggest changes and corruption of the original texts.\n\nAncient Hindu legal texts and traditions arrived in parts of Southeast Asia (Cambodia, Java, Bali, Malaysia, Thailand, and Burma) as trade grew and as part of a larger culture sharing in ancient Asia. In each of these regions, Hindu law fused with local norms and practices, giving rise to legal texts (Āgamas such as the Kuṭāra-Mānawa in Java, and the Buddhist-influenced Dhammasattas/Dhammathats of Burma and Thailand) as well as legal records embodied (as in India) in stone and copper-plate inscriptions.\n\nIn 18th century, the earliest British of the East India Company acted as agents of the Mughal emperor. As the British colonial rule took over the political and administrative powers in India, it was faced with various state responsibilities such as legislative and judiciary functions. The East India Company, and later the British Crown, sought profits for its British shareholders through trade as well as sought to maintain effective political control with minimal military engagement. The administration pursued a path of least resistance, relying upon co-opted local intermediaries that were mostly Muslims and some Hindus in various princely states. The British exercised power by avoiding interference and adapting to law practices as explained by the local intermediaries. The colonial state thus sustained what were essentially pre-colonial religious and political law and conflicts, well into the late nineteenth century. The colonial policy on the system of personal laws for India, for example, was expressed by Governor-General Hastings in 1772 as follows,\nFor Muslims of India, the code of Muslim law was readily available in al-Hidaya and Fatawa-i Alamgiri written under sponsorship of Aurangzeb. For Hindus and other non-Muslims such as Buddhists, Sikhs, Jains, Parsis and Tribal people, this information was unavailable. The British colonial officials, for practice, attempted to extract from the Dharmaśāstra the English categories of law and religion for the purposes of colonial administration.\n\nThe early period of Anglo-Hindu Law (1772–1828) was structured along the lines of Muslim law practice. It included the extracted portions of law from one Dharmaśāstra by British colonial government appointed scholars (especially Jones, Henry Thomas Colebrooke, Sutherland, and Borrodaile) in a manner similar to Islamic al-Hidaya and Fatawa-i Alamgiri. It also included the use of court pandits in British courts to aid British judges in interpreting Shastras just like Qadis (Maulavis) for interpreting the Islamic law.\n\nThe arrival of William Bentinck as the Governor-General of British India in 1828, marked a shift towards universal civil code, whose administration emphasized same law for all human beings, individualism and equal treatment to help liberate, empower and end social practices among Hindus and Muslims of India that had received much public coverage in Britain through the publications of Christian missionaries and individuals such as Thomas Macaulay.\n\nGovernor-General Dalhousie, in 1848, extended this trend and stated his policy that the law must \"treat all natives much the same manner\". Over time, between 1828-1855, a series of British parliamentary acts were passed to revise the Anglo-Hindu and Anglo-Muslim laws, such as those relating to the right to religious conversion, widow remarriage, and right to create wills for inheritance. In 1832, the British colonial government abolished accepting religious fatwa as a source of law. In 1835, the British began creating a criminal code that would replace the existing criminal code which was a complex conflicting mixture of laws derived from Muslim texts (Quran) and Hindu texts (Shastras), and this common criminal code was ready by 1855. These changes were welcomed by Hindu law reform movement, but considered abrogating religion-defined rules within the Muslim law. The changes triggered discontent, call for jihad and religious war, and became partly responsible for the 1857 Indian revolt against the British rule.\n\nIn 1864, after the East India Company was dissolved and India became a formal part of the British Empire, Anglo-Hindu law entered into a second phase (1864–1947), one in which British colonial courts in India relied less on the Muslim Qadis and Hindu Pandits for determining the respective religious laws, and relied more on a written law. A universal criminal code in India, that did not discriminate between people based on their religion, was adopted for the first time in 1864. It was expanded to include a universal procedural and commercial code by 1882, which overruled pre-existing Anglo-Hindu and Anglo-Muslim laws. However, the personal laws for Muslims remained sharia-based, while the Anglo-Hindu law was enacted independent of any text on matters such as marriage, divorce, inheritance and the Anglo-Hindu law covered all Hindus, Jains, Sikhs and Buddhists in India. In 1872, the British crown enacted the Indian Christian Marriage Act which covered marriage, divorce and alimony laws for Indian Christians of all denominations except the Roman Catholics.\n\nThe development of legal pluralism, that is separate law based on individual's religion, was controversial in India from the very start.\n\nAfter the independence of India from the colonial rule of Britain in 1947, India adopted a new constitution in 1950. Most of the legal code from the colonial era continued as the law of the new nation, including the personal laws contained in Anglo-Hindu law for Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs, the Anglo-Christian law for Christians, and the Anglo-Muslim law for Muslims. Article 44 of the 1950 Indian constitution mandates a uniform civil code, eliminating all religion-based civil laws including Hindu law, Christian law and Muslim law throughout the territory of India. However, while Hindu law has since been amended to be independent of ancient religious texts, the Article 44 of the Indian constitution has remained largely ignored in matters of Muslim law,by successive Indian governments since 1950.\n\nAn amendment to the constitution (42nd Amendment, 1976) formally inserted the word \"secular\" as a feature of the Indian republic. However, unlike the Western concept of secularism which separates religion and state, the concept of secularism in India means acceptance of religious laws as binding on the state, and equal participation of state in different religions.\n\nSince the early 1950s, India has debated whether legal pluralism should be replaced with legal universalism and a uniform civil code that does not differentiate between people based on their religion. This debate remains unresolved. The Quran-based Indian Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act of 1937 remains the law of the land of modern India for Indian Muslims, while the Parliamentary, non-religious uniform civil code passed in the mid-1950s applies to Indians who are Hindus (along with Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs and Parsees), as well as to Indian Christians and Jews. In 1955, India revised its Hindu Marriage Act and it applied to all Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs; scholars contest whether the law applies to cases where either the husband or wife is Hindu, Buddhist, Jain or Sikh, and the other is a Christian or Muslim.\n\n\nSources\n\n\n\n"}
