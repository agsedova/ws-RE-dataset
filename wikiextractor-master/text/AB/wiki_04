One of its first titles, \"Night Trap\" (starring Dana Plato) was originally produced as a title for the NEMO, before being converted for use with Sega's new Sega CD. The mature-themed content of \"Night Trap\" made it the source of some controversy. Nevertheless, the title was a bestseller. Digital Pictures went on to create other full motion video-based titles primarily for Sega hardware, and are regarded as a pioneer of the interactive movie genre. However, the company declined in the mid-1990s due to waning interest in full motion video games. Its final title, \"Maximum Surge\" went unreleased and was later repurposed into a film called \"Game Over\".\n\nThe founders of Digital Pictures met in the late 1980s while working at a division of the toy manufacturer Hasbro originally called \"Hasbro Interactive\" and later renamed \"Isix.\" The Isix team developed a video game system called NEMO (a code name abbreviation for \"never ever mention outside\") that used VHS tapes rather than cartridges, which allowed games to offer live action and interactive full motion video. They also developed a software prototype called \"Scene Of The Crime,\" which led to the production of two full-length titles, \"Night Trap\" and \"Sewer Shark\".\n\nAfter Hasbro executives declined to bring the NEMO system to market, closing its Isix division, key members of the Isix team founded Digital Pictures in 1991 and purchased the NEMO software assets from Hasbro. Digital Pictures converted \"Night Trap\" and \"Sewer Shark\" from their video-tape-based format to the Sega CD platform.\nThroughout the 1990s, Digital Pictures continued to design interactive full motion video games for the CD-ROM format. Steve Russell worked for the company for a time. Several celebrities, including actors Steve Eastin, Corey Haim, Yasmine Bleeth, R. Lee Ermey, and Dana Plato; sports stars Scottie Pippen and Mike Ditka; and musicians Debbie Harry, INXS, Kris Kross, C+C Music Factory, and Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch, appeared in Digital Pictures games.\n\nIn the early 1990s, \"Night Trap\" was singled out by numerous interest groups and by Senators Joseph Lieberman and Herbert Kohl as evidence that the video game industry was marketing games with graphic violence and other adult content to minors. Concern about \"Night Trap\" and several other games such as \"Mortal Kombat\" helped to bring about the creation of the ESRB video game rating system.\n\nBy the late 1990s, consumer interest in full-motion video games, which accounted for the majority of the company's profits, was in decline. After the collapse of the company, its assets were acquired by Cyber Cinema Interactive. The new company intended to re-release the games for DVD but that never came about. The only actual production for Cyber Cinema was the direct to video film \"Game Over\" – also known as \"Maximum Surge Movie\". It used footage from an unreleased video game called \"Maximum Surge\" as well as clips from other Digital Pictures games. Although the film boasted stars such as Yasmine Bleeth and Walter Koenig, they only appear in the segments that had been pulled from the FMV sequences of the game, which suffer from lower image quality than the original footage.\n\nFlash Film Works later acquired the rights to some of the games. They remastered and re-released \"Double Switch\" and \"Quarterback Attack\" for iTunes and Google Play in late 2016 before partnering with Screaming Villains and Limited Run Games to release PlayStation 4 remasters starting in 2018 with \"Double Switch\" and 2019 with \"Corpse Killer\".\n\n"}

It was the first to be completed. The Man Mo Temple was a place for trial in very early years.\n\nHollywood Road was put up early in 1844, before the more famous Hollywood in California was settled. The street runs between Central and Sheung Wan, with Wyndham Street, Arbuthnot Road, Ladder Street, Upper Lascar Row, and Old Bailey Street in the vicinity. \n\nIt was probably named by Sir John Francis Davis, the second Governor of Hong Kong, after his family home at Westbury-on-Trym, near Bristol, England. Another origin mentioned for the name is that holly shrubs were growing in the area when the road was constructed. Such plants were not indigenous to the area and would have been imported.\n\nHollywood Road was the second road to be built when the colony of Hong Kong was founded, after Queen's Road Central. It was the first to be completed. Like most major roads in the early years of the colony, Hollywood Road was built by the Royal Engineers. More than 100 years ago, Hollywood Road was rather close to the coastline. In those days, foreign merchants and sailors would put up the antiques and artefacts they \"collected\" from China for sale here on their way back to Europe. This is how Hollywood Road began its role as an antique market. The 1960 Hollywood film \"The World of Suzie Wong\" was shot in part in Hollywood Road. An old wood-built building was re-constructed as a bar for the movie.\n\nThere was a Union Church in the street founded in 1844 by the Reverend James Legge, a Scottish missionary who had been sent to Hong Kong in 1843 by the London Missionary Society. The first Union Church was built in 1845 on Hollywood Road above Central. Every Sunday an English language service was held in the morning and a Chinese language service in the afternoon. The Church was later relocated to a new site on Staunton Street.\n\nHollywood Road is filled with trinket and antique shops of all sorts: from Chinese furniture to porcelain ware, from Buddha sculptures to Tibetan rugs, from Japanese netsukes to Coromandel screens, from Ming dynasty ceramic horsemen and kitsch Maoist memorabilia. Previously known solely for antique shops, Hollywood Road has developed into a contemporary art district in Hong Kong. The first gallery to open was Plum Blossoms in 1987. From then on, many galleries opened in the area.\n\nMan Mo Temple or Man Mo Miu (文武廟) is a common sort of temple for worshipping the Man Tai (文帝), Pau Kung and Mo Tai (武帝), Kwan Yu, to pray for good results in examinations in China. The one on the Hollywood Road was built in 1847. It has been managed by Tung Wah Group of Hospitals since 1908. It is a declared monument.\n\nCentral Police Station was the first police station in Hong Kong. The oldest structure within the compound is a barrack block built in 1864. It is a three-storey building constructed alongside Victoria Prison (see below). A storey was later added to the mass in 1905. In 1919, Headquarters Block facing Hollywood Road was constructed. Subsequently in 1925, the two-storey Stable Block was constructed at the northwest end of the procession ground and later used as a munitions store. The Police Station accompanied by the former Central Magistracy and Victoria Prison form a group of historical architecture representing law and order in Hong Kong.\n\nOther features along Hollywood Road include:\n\n\n"}

He is a two-time Olympic bronze medalist (1994, 1998), a two-time World medalist (1994 silver, 1995 bronze), a two-time European silver medalist (1993, 1997), and a four-time French national champion (1994–97). He has been a commentator for French television during figure skating events at the Olympics. He also voices a villain, \"Frozer\", in \"\".\n\nPhilippe Candeloro was born in Courbevoie, France, the youngest of four children. His father, Luigi, was a mason, and, a few years after Philippe's birth, built a family home in the Parisian suburb of Colombes.\n\nEarly in his childhood Candeloro enjoyed swimming and elastic springboard. In 1979, at age seven, he began taking weekly ice skating lessons. During one of his first lessons, trainer André Brunet noted Candeloro's potential and invited him to increase his skating practices. At first, he participated in the village's hockey team but quickly veered into figure skating. He stole one of his first pairs of skates. His mother paid for them when the theft was discovered.\n\nWithin a few years of stepping onto the ice, Candeloro found himself on the fast track with the French figure skating federation. He was invited to a summer training camp at Font-Romeu, which would become an annual event for him. When he was 10, the French Federation offered him a place at the prestigious national training center in Paris, INSEP. Candeloro refused this invitation, opting instead to continue training in Colombes with Brunet. At the age of 16, he left school to concentrate full-time on his training.\n\nBy sixteen, Candeloro was receiving attention from both the French Federation and the international skating community. He participated in the closing ceremony at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary and began to work with choreographer Natacha Dabadie. His goal of competing at the 1992 Olympics in Albertville, France was derailed in October 1991 when he broke his leg. He finished third at the French nationals and was assigned to the post-Olympic World Championships, where he placed ninth.\n\nIn the 1992–93 season, Candeloro won gold at the 1992 NHK Trophy and silver at the 1993 European Championships. He finished fifth at the World Championships. In the first half of the following season, he placed fifth at Skate America and earned medals at three events — Piruetten, International de Paris, and NHK Trophy — before becoming French national champion for the first time. Candeloro finished off the podium at the 1994 European Championships but a month later he won the bronze medal at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. He ended his season with a silver medal at the 1994 World Championships in Chiba, Japan. He then toured with Champions on Ice in the United States and performed in other shows. In France, he attracted sponsorships and television and print publicity.\n\nCandeloro had mixed results in the following years. The bronze medalist at the 1995 World Championships in Birmingham, England, he placed ninth the next season at the 1996 World Championships in Edmonton, Canada. After finishing off the podium at three Europeans in a row, he won silver at the 1997 European Championships in Paris, France.\n\nIn the 1997–98 season, Candeloro again placed fifth at the pre-Olympic European Championships but went on to win the bronze medal at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. Following his second Olympics, Candeloro turned pro and appeared in a wide variety of tours and professional competitions ; in 2000, he became world champion... In the United States he was a popular fixture with Champions on Ice; in Europe he founded the successful Candel Euro Tour and performed with the \"Holiday on Ice\" tour. He also appeared as Captain Sheng in a Disney television special based on the cartoon \"Mulan\", with Michelle Kwan playing the title role. He started his farewell tour, \"Hello and Goodbye\", in France in February 2008.\n\nCandeloro's signature move, in which he spins and drops to his knees on the ice, is not allowed in amateur competition. He developed the spin accidentally when he slipped to his knees during a scratch spin.\n\nCandeloro has worked as a sports journalist. During the 2006 Olympics, Candeloro stirred controversy by commenting that Olympic champion Shizuka Arakawa was \"worth a bowl of rice\" after rising from third place to win the gold medal. Apologizing to the Japanese ambassador to France, Hiroshi Hirabayashi, who was unaware of the comment, French public television stated, \"We were taken aback by the comment.\" In 2014, Candeloro and his co-commentator Nelson Montfort were criticized for some of their comments on female skaters at the Sochi Olympics. In March 2014, the Conseil supérieur de l'audiovisuel issued a warning to the broadcaster, France Télévisions, stating that some comments were \"inappropriate\" and \"reflected sexist prejudice\".\n\nCandeloro is known to be a big fan of Japanese figure skater Mao Asada, calling himself her 'godfather'.\n\nIn 2011, he was one of the contestants during the second season of \"Danse avec les stars\".\n\nCandeloro is married to ballet dancer Olivia Darmon, with whom he has three daughters: Luna Nizza, Maya Estella and Thalia Soleya. He was introduced to his future wife by the choreographer of his 1994 Olympic program, Natasha Dabadie. He speaks several languages besides French, including English and Italian.\n\nIn 2008, Candeloro was involved in the development of a namesake rose, the Philippe Candeloro rose with Lyonnais rose breeder Jean-Pierre Guillot.\n\nHe narrowly escaped his death in the Villa Castelli helicopter collision in 2015, when he had to be forced to wait for one of the helicopters on the next flight due to over-occupancy. The accident claimed 10 lives, including 3 French athletes.\n\n\"GP: Champions Series (Grand Prix)\"\n"}

He was Interior Minister from 2001 to 2003 and Speaker of the State Duma (the lower house of parliament) from 2003 to 2011. He is one of the leaders of the largest Russian political party, United Russia. Boris Gryzlov is a close ally of President Vladimir Putin.\n\nGryzlov was born in Vladivostok but was raised in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg). He graduated from the Leningrad Electrical Institute of Communications in 1973 and worked as a radio engineer. From 1977 to 1996 he worked his way up from being an engineer to division director in the Elektronpribor plant. He was not a public figure before 1999. In October 1999 he became head of the St Petersburg regional branch of Sergey Shoygu's Unity party and in December 1999 he was elected to the State Duma running on the Unity party ticket. In January 2000 he was elected chairman of the Unity fraction in the Duma.\n\nIn March 2001 he was appointed to the post of chief of Russian police and became Interior Minister. In this position Gryzlov proclaimed that the fight against terrorism and corruption were his priorities.\n\nGryzlov supported the Kremlin's policies in Chechnya and won the reputation of being a trusted and loyal supporter of the president.\n\nIn August 2001 Boris Gryzlov claimed that up to 100 industrial enterprises in Saint Petersburg, including the Petersburg Fuel Company, a leading gasoline retailing operator in the city, as well as the four main sea ports of Northwestern Russia, Saint Petersburg, Kaliningrad, Arkhangelsk and Murmansk, were controlled by the Tambov Gang. In May 2002 he sent a commission to St. Petersburg to investigate corruption allegations in the city's gasoline market. The investigation was initiated after the Faeton Gasoline Company, the second leading fuel retailing company in the city, had complained to both Gryzlov and the Prosecutor General's Office in April that the Saint Petersburg City Administration had given preferential treatment to the Petersburg Fuel Company.\n\nWithin a year he returned to party politics and in November 2002 became the head of the United Russia, a centrist pro-Putin group what emerged from Unity and several other pro-government movements that joined it. In December 2003 Boris Gryzlov was elected as speaker of the Duma.\n\nIn November 2009, Gryzlov defined United Russia's ideology as \"Russian conservatism\"characterizing such conservatism as \"an ideology of stability and development, constant creative renovation of society without stagnation and revolutions.\" Gryzlov resigned from the office of Parliament speaker on 14 December 2011, amongst accusations of polling fraud orchestrated by the United Russia party in the 2011 Russian Duma elections.\n\nIn 2005, one of the statements of Gryzlov was famously mis-quoted: the phrase, ascribed to him was, \"Parliament is no place for discussions.\" Gryzlov was widely criticized and ridiculed by Russian liberals for allegedly making this statement, and was later misquoted, among others, by Garry Kasparov, a chess champion and one of the prominent opposition spokespersons in the West.\n\nIn fact, however, Gryzlov never made such a statement. Original phrase was pronounced on December, 29th, 2003: \"I believe that the Parliament should not be a ground for political battles, for fighting for political slogans and ideologies. This is a place where [MPs] should be engaged in a constructive, effective legislative activity\". The phrase was later abridged by journalists to the infamous \"the Parliament is no place for discussions\".\n\nFollowing the 2007 Parliamentary elections, Gryzlov responded to criticism of electoral violations saying: \"They in no way put in doubt the final result. The fact that these violations have been registered shows that we have a transparent ballot.\"\n\nFollowing the 2009 regional parliamentary elections, Gryzlov stated in response to criticism of electoral violations: \"Corruption and legal nihilism, inherent to Russian mentality, should not be shifted onto \"United Russia\" party\". Representatives of the nationalist Movement Against Illegal Immigration responded by telling the press that they were offended by such comments. The nationalists attempted to file charges against Gryzlov for belittling the Russian people under the same article used to prosecute nationalists for incitement to inter-ethnic violence, but these allegations were rejected by the prosecutor general.\n\nHe has also voiced significant support for the controversial Russian inventor Viktor Petrik, even co-signing together with Petrik a number of patent applications. After the Russian Academy of Sciences commission claimed that Petrik was a fraud, Gryzlov denounced the panel as obscurantism.\n\n"}
{"id": "1919071", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1919071", "title": "Porringer", "text": "Porringer\n\nA porringer is a shallow bowl, between 4 and 6 inches (100 to 150mm) in diameter, and 1½\" to 3\" (40 to 80mm) deep; the form originated in the medieval period in Europe and was made in wood, ceramic, pewter and silver. They had flat, horizontal handles. Colonial porringers tended to have one handle, whereas European ones tended to have two handles on opposite sides, on which the owner's initials were sometimes engraved, and they occasionally came with a lid. Porringers resembled the smaller quaich, a Scottish drinking vessel.\n\nOne can discern authentic pewter porringers in much the same way that silver can be authenticated from the touch marks that were stamped either into the bowl of the porringer or on its base. Wooden porringers are occasionally found from excavations; e.g. 16th-century example from Southwark and 11th century from Winchester.\n\nThe most famous colonial porringers are probably those made by Paul Revere.\n\nIn more modern times, some manufacturers of porringers have produced them without handles. These types of porringers appear to be deep bowls, with the sides being nearly totally flat. Porringers are also used less and less, as a bowl will suffice for most people; porringers, however, are still circulated, mainly as a Christening-gift.\n\nA second, modern usage, for the term porringer is a double saucepan similar to a bain-marie used for cooking porridge. The porridge is cooked gently in the inner saucepan, heated by steam from boiling water in the outer saucepan. This ensures the porridge does not burn and allows a longer cooking time so that the oats can absorb the water or milk in which they are cooked more completely. Also the porridge does not need stirring during the cooking process, which means the oats maintain their structural integrity and the porridge has a better mouthfeel and texture. The lower heat may also degrade less of the beta-glucan in the oats, which gives oats their cholesterol-lowering properties.\n\nPorringers were also made out of red earthenware clay in a type of pottery that is called \"redware\" today but called \"earthen\" during colonial and Early America. These would have the typical strap or pulled handle that is familiar on mugs and cups today. \n\nSome collectors or materials historians also call what resembles the pewter porringer a \"bleeding cup\".\n\n\n"}

In 1962, at the age of 19, Lotsof was addicted to heroin and accidentally discovered the anti-addictive effects of ibogaine. He later attended Fairleigh Dickinson University and then New York University, graduating with a degree in film in 1976.\n\nLotsof authored and co-authoring numerous research papers and was awarded a number of patents for the treatment of various chemical dependencies with ibogaine. The first of his patents, issued in 1985, was US Patent 4,499,096, Rapid Method for Interrupting the Narcotic Addiction Syndrome. The last patent in the series for the use of ibogaine to treat chemical dependence was US Patent 5,152,994, Rapid Method for Interrupting or Attenuating Poly-Drug Dependency Syndromes, awarded October 6, 1992. Lotsof was active in promoting medical usage and further research of ibogaine and had an interest in chemical dependence patient advocacy including authoring the Ibogaine Patients' Bill of Rights.\n\nThe systematic use of ibogaine was developed first by the Bwiti discipline from where it originated, by the Babongo, Mitsogo and Fang peoples of Gabon and Cameroon, while Western clinical treatment, mostly for the treatment of substance addictions, began was pioneered by Lotsof and others. In the 1980s, Lotsof convinced a Belgian company to manufacture Ibogaine in capsule form and performed successful trials in the Netherlands. The use of ibogaine spread across Europe, and was brought to the Americas by Eric Taub in 1992, who had contacted Lotsof in 1989. Lex Kogan later joined Taub and systematized the treatment of ibogaine with centers across the world, and further academic research and trials were conducted by Deborah Mash. As the use of ibogaine spread, its administration has varied widely, with some groups administering it systematically with well developed methods and medical personnel, while many use or administer it haphazardly in a way that many believe is dangerous.\n\nLotsof was a member of the Board of Directors of the National Alliance of Methadone Advocates and President of the Dora Weiner Foundation. In March 2009, Lotsof was honored for his discovery of ibogaine's antiaddictive effects during the Sayulita, Mexico ibogaine Provider and Facilitator conference. Some fifty experts from around the world joined to present on ibogaine and associated subjects. \n\nHe died on January 31, 2010, aged 66, from liver cancer.\n\nLotsof was born in The Bronx, New York to Abnor and Lillian Lotsof.

She also served as a Member of the European Parliament from 2009 until 2019.\n\nBorn in the neighbourhood of Grünerløkka, Oslo in 1943 during Norway's occupation by Nazi Germany, she was raised by a tailor father and a hairdresser mother and grew up in what was then a working-class district of the inner city. She moved to Paris at 20 to work as an au pair. There she married the son of the family who employed her, Pascal Joly (now deceased), and adopted her middle name 'Eva', which is easier to pronounce in French.\n\nWhile working as a secretary, Joly studied law at night school and became a magistrate when she was 38. Joly specialised in financial affairs, and as an investigating judge.\n\nHere she quickly made a mark with her crusade against corruption, in particular taking on, among others, former minister Bernard Tapie and the bank Crédit Lyonnais. Her most famous case, however, was that of France's leading oil company, Elf Aquitaine. In the face of death threats, she carried on the case to uncover several cases of fraud, leading to the conviction of tens of persons involved in the oil business. In 2001, she received for this work the award for integrity from the non-governmental organisation Transparency International.\n\nIn 2002, Joly was asked by the Norwegian Minister of Justice, Odd Einar Dørum, to accept a three-year position as a special advisor on corruption. The \"Anti-Corruption and Money Laundering project\" involved cooperation between the Ministry of Justice and Police, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Norway. The project worked on issues related to financial crimes and organized crime, with a special focus on strong international cooperation. Collaboration with the Ministry of Finance was also important, in addition to strengthening connections to the private sector. The project has among other things led to a Norwegian focus on corruption in foreign affairs. During the three-year period Joly also initiated the \"Paris Declaration Against Corruption\" in 2003.\n\nThe 2006 French film \"L'Ivresse du pouvoir\" (English title \"Comedy of Power\") is loosely based on Joly.\n\nIn 2009, Joly was employed as a special adviser by the Icelandic government to investigate the possibility that white-collar crime may have played a part in the 2008–2012 Icelandic financial crisis.\n\nOn 10 June 2009, Joly was a guest at a popular talk show in Iceland and implied that she would quit as advisor to the Icelandic government if it did not do more to help the investigation.\n\nOn 7 June 2009, Joly was elected as a French member of the European Parliament on the Ile de France \"Europe Écologie\" list on which she was second after Daniel Cohn-Bendit.\n\nDuring her first term in Parliament between 2009 and 2014, Joly held the position of chairwoman of the Committee on Development. After the 2014 European elections, Joly joined the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. She later became vice-chairwoman of the Parliament's special committees created to investigate the Luxleaks scandal in 2015 into the Panama Papers scandal in 2016, respectively. Within the Greens–European Free Alliance parliamentary group, she served as spokesperson on financial policy.\n\nIn addition to her committee assignments, Joly was a member of the Parliament's delegations for relations with Afghanistan and to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Mediterranean. She previously served as member of the delegation to the ACP–EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly between 2009 and 2014.\n\nJoly also worked in Afghanistan during July 2012 as part of an UN anti-corruption mission.\n\nWhen Joly filed a lawsuit in December 2015 on behalf of the company's works council, a preliminary tax inquiry into McDonald's was opened in early 2015. Joly accused the company of understating its earnings to avoid a legal obligation to share profits with employees.\n\nIn 2011, Joly competed in the primaries of Europe Écologie–The Greens against Nicolas Hulot, Stéphane Lhomme and Henri Stoll to represent the party at the 2012 presidential election. She was elected in the second round of voting against Hulot, with 58% of votes. At the first round of the presidential election, she received 2.3% of the vote, and subsequently endorsed Socialist Party candidate François Hollande for the second round.\n\n\nDuring her 2012 presidential campaign, Joly called for stopping all nuclear energy production in France by 2020 and deriving 40% of the country's energy needs from renewable sources by that date. She also wanted to replace the Stability and Growth Pact on budget discipline with an Ecological and Social Development Pact, with financial, environmental and social targets.\n\nIn addition, Joly promised to increase minimum income benefits by 50%, freeze rents for three years and introduce new tax rates of 60% for those earning 100,000 euros or more a year and 70% for those earning over 500,000 euros. She also demanded a minimum 17% corporate tax rate on multinational companies.\n\n\nIn June 2010, Joly was sent a court summons by Nadine Berthélémy-Dupuis, an investigating magistrate in Paris, following a legal complaint from David Douillet, a retired sportsman and a national member of parliament from France's then-ruling Union for a Popular Movement. Douillet alleged that Joly breached France's defamation laws when she made comments at a public meeting in September 2009 about his banking arrangements.\n\nIn November 2011, Joly was criticized for her support of the Greens' deal with the Socialist Party under which they gained safe seats in parliament, in exchange for accepting a slow-motion plan to reduce nuclear energy use to 50 percent of electricity generation by 2025.\n\nDuring her 2012 presidential campaign, Joly led reporters on a tour of sites linked to bad publicity or sleaze allegations around then-president Nicolas Sarkozy. Her tour included a Champs-Élysées nightspot in which Sarkozy feted his 2007 victory with millionaire friends, and the home of L'Oréal heiress Liliane Bettencourt, at the centre of an investigation into illegal alleged cash contributions to his 2007 campaign.\n\n\n\n"}

It was headquartered in the First American Center in downtown Nashville.\n\nThe bank began, in Nashville, as the American National Bank and later (1930), merged with James E. Caldwell's Fourth and First National Bank, to become First American National Bank. In 1971, construction of the First American Center (now the UBS Tower) in downtown Nashville resulted in the discovery of the skeleton of a sabertooth cat (\"Smilodon floridanus\") within a cave beneath the bedrock. First American National Bank facilitated archaeological excavations at the site, funded radiocarbon analysis of the bone, and altered their original building design to protect the remnants of the cave, which still exist beneath the lower level of the building's parking garage. The cave is known variously as the \"First American Cave\" or by its official state archaeological site number, 40DV40. In 1997, the \"Smilodon\" skeleton from the First American Site was the source for the logo of the Nashville Predators hockey team and the inspiration for their mascot, Gnash.\n\nIts name and logo disappeared in December 2000 when it was acquired by AmSouth Bancorporation, an institution based in Birmingham, Alabama that was slightly smaller in size. First American had operated as a fully owned subsidiary of AmSouth for most of the year 2000. First American was sold after a series of unprofitable mergers, including one with Jackson, Mississippi-based Deposit Guaranty Bank that proved to be a hurdle the corporation could not clear financially. Deposit Guaranty was fully integrated into First American, but kept its name. This allowed FANB to gain significant market share in Mississippi, Arkansas, and Louisiana, though it did not operate these branches under the corporate brand.\n\nFirst American's demise ended Nashville's storied history as a strong financial center. It, along with Third National Bank (now a part of SunTrust) and Commerce Union Bank (now a part of Bank of America), was once involved in a tight three-way battle for market share that ultimately helped all three banks expand well beyond their respective bounds. When the resources of the three could no longer stand the rapid expansion and numerous acquisitions, they all succumbed and merged with other banks. FANB, the largest of these three banks, was the only one to fold itself into a smaller institution. As of 2007, Nashville is still home to several local banks, but most do not exist outside of Davidson County.\n\nUntil 2005, AmSouth Bank continued First American's former tradition of having the highest market share in Nashville, however it was surpassed by SunTrust after its acquisition of Memphis-based National Commerce Financial. In 2006, however, AmSouth reclaimed the distinction of largest market share in metropolitan Nashville. In 2006-2007, AmSouth merged with Regions Financial Corporation which is headquartered in Birmingham. The newly combined bank retained Nashville's largest market share in addition to AmSouth's CEO, C. Dowd Ritter continuing as CEO of the company.\n\nFirst American was very visible in the Nashville area and carried a large load of sponsorships, most notably the now-closed First American Music Center, to which it held naming rights for just one season before selling to AmSouth. First American also prided itself as the \"official bank\" of several Nashville-based sports franchises, including the Tennessee Titans, Nashville Predators, Nashville Kats, and Nashville Sounds. Following the purchase, AmSouth/Regions opted to let each of these sponsorships expire without renewal.\n\nThere are several regional banks around the United States that now carry the \"First American\" name. One in particular, in Mississippi, has adopted the full name \"First American National Bank\". None of these regional institutions are affiliated with the former First American National Bank or AmSouth Bancorporation.\n"}
{"id": "1919101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1919101", "title": "Friedrich Wieck", "text": "Friedrich Wieck\n\nJohann Gottlob Friedrich Wieck (18 August 1785 – 6 October 1873, aged 88) was a noted German piano teacher, voice teacher, owner of a piano store, and author of essays and music reviews. He is remembered as the teacher of his daughter, Clara, a child prodigy who was undertaking international concert tours by age eleven and who later married her father's pupil Robert Schumann, in defiance of her father's extreme objections. As Clara Schumann, she became one of the most famous pianists of her time. Another of Wieck's daughters, Marie Wieck, also had a career in music, although not nearly so illustrious as Clara's. Other pupils included Hans von Bülow.\n\nWieck was born in Pretzsch, not far from Leipzig, in 1785, the son of a not very successful merchant. Although the family was not musical, Wieck was deeply interested in music and attended the Thomas-Schule in Leipzig in 1798; however, because of illness, his stay lasted only six weeks and he was forced to return home. In 1800 he attended the Torgau \"gymnasium\", where he received his only formal training in piano, six hours of lessons from Johann Peter Milchmeyer. He had little exposure to the wider world of music and he later developed his pedagogical theories by reading Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi.\n\nHe studied theology at the University of Wittenberg in preparation for the ministry, matriculating in 1803, and, having preached the obligatory trial sermon in Dresden, he left theology. The following nine years he worked as a private tutor to various wealthy families in Thuringia. He became a friend of a music teacher, Adolph Bargiel, at his first position with a Baron von Seckendorff in Querfurth, and in 1815 he composed a group of songs which he sent to Carl Maria von Weber. The songs were published and reviewed in the \"Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung\". Spurred on by a favorable comment (also including harsh criticism) from von Weber, he left his position as a tutor and established himself in Leipzig as a piano teacher and in the business of renting and selling pianos and other musical instruments and keeping a music lending library, which Richard Wagner was known to use.\n\nMarriage was considered by Wieck as a means to improve his status, which he did in 1816 by marrying Mariane Tromlitz. Tromlitz was a famous singer in Leipzig at the time. She taught the more advanced piano students of Wieck. As an accomplished singer, Marianne Tromlitz sang at the well-known Gewandhaus in Leipzig on a weekly basis.\n\nHe did everything to be known as father of a child prodigy, a piano virtuoso. Clara Schumann was his second born and her musical education was planned down to the smallest detail. She daily received one-hour lesson (in piano, violin, singing, theory, harmony, composition, and counterpoint), and two hours of practice, using the teaching methods he had developed on his own. He accompanied her on the tours throughout Europe. His wife gave birth to another two children, Alwyn and Gustav. The differences between Wieck and his wife, Marianne, were irreconcilable in large part due to Wieck’s unyielding nature. When his friend Adolph Bargiel, father of Woldemar Bargiel, had an affair with her, she divorced Wieck in 1824. She then married Adolph Bargiel.\n\nHis second wife, Clementine Fechner – whom he married in 1828 – was twenty years his junior. Clementine was the sister of painter Eduard Clemens Fechner and of experimental psychology pioneer Gustav Fechner. One of the three children she gave birth to, besides Cäcilie and Clemens (1829–1833), who died at the age of four, Marie Wieck was also a concert pianist, although she was not as famous as was his first-born daughter. In 1844, he moved to Dresden, where he lived for the rest of his life, spending the summers at Loschwitz, where he died in 1873.\n\nHis home was a meeting place for his piano students and other musicians. Not only his wife, his children, and his close friends, but also his business associates were affected by his drive to success. Felix Mendelssohn supported his becoming professor of piano at the Leipzig Conservatory, although the post went to Ignaz Moscheles.\n\nHis methods appear progressive, flexible, nuanced, emphasizing the individuality of the student and leading the student on by means of the enjoyment of music-making rather than harsh discipline and drills. For him, mere finger dexterity was not the focus, and he did not advocate monotonous, mechanical exercises. He emphasized evenness of tone, a beautiful, song-like legato, and expressiveness. While including finger-stretching exercises to increase the student's span, he was careful to avoid fatigue by limiting the number of hours of practice per day and insisting on long walks and fresh air. Overall musical development was essential, achieved by lessons in theory, counterpoint and composition, and regular exposure to the best possible musical performances.\n\nIn practice, however, he might not always have lived up to the ideals he described in the book \"Piano and Song: How to Teach, How To Learn, and How to Form a Judgment of Musical Performances.\" When Robert Schumann was living and studying in the Wieck household, he reported seeing Wieck punishing his nine-year-old son, Alwyn, for playing the violin poorly, tearing at his hair and yelling, \"You wretch, you scoundrel, is this the way you try to please your father?\" Clara seemed unconcerned at the violent scene. Shocked, Schumann wrote in his diary, \"Am I among human beings?\" Besides the book he published some studies and exercises for the piano, a number of pamphlets and substantial essays, and edited various piano works.\n\nA turning point came in Wieck's life when Clara and Robert Schumann fell in love.\n\nFearing that her marriage to an impecunious composer would destroy the plans he had for her music career, he opposed their union in every way he could. He threatened to shoot Robert. The young lovers resorted to clandestine meetings and letter-writing. Because Clara was not yet of age, her father's consent was required before they could marry. Not receiving his consent, they applied to the Saxon Court of Appeals for permission to be married without his consent. Wieck threatened that if Clara did not give up Robert, he would disinherit her, deprive her even of the money she had earned herself and tie the pair up in legal proceedings for 3–5 years. On July 2, 1839 Schumann's attorney tried to negotiate with Wieck but was unsuccessful.\n\nOn July 16 Schumann filed a complaint against Wieck. The court scheduled a meeting for Wieck, Clara and Robert but when the day came Wieck did not appear, pleading that he was too busy. He then offered to settle with the court, setting highly demanding terms: he would allow Clara to marry provided that Clara give all her seven years of concert earnings to her brothers and pay 1000 thalers in order to retrieve her piano and personal belongings from the Wieck home; he demanded that Robert set aside 8000 thalers to be invested so that the interest would compensate Clara if the marriage failed.\n\nThe court rejected his highly demanding terms. Wieck asked for another conference with the court, which was set for October 2, but again Wieck failed to appear. The conference was re-scheduled for December 18. Four days before the conference date, Wieck filed another appeal, an ugly, defamatory \"declaration\" to court objecting to the marriage, accusing Schumann of a litany of weaknesses and vices, especially habitual drunkenness and the inability to support a wife. Schumann \"cannot speak coherently or write legibly,\" he is \"lazy, unreliable, and conceited,\" \"a mediocre composer whose music is unclear and almost impossible to perform,\" \"incompetent, childish, unmanly, in short totally lost for any social adjustment.\" Some of the information he used was obtained by breaking into Clara's locked letter-box. The court did not issue a judgment for several months.\n\nWieck took to spreading vicious rumours against the couple. He sent copies of his court documents to every city where Clara was planning to give concerts. When she traveled to Hamburg and Berlin to perform, he sent letters claiming that Clara's playing had declined. Striking an emotional blow against Clara, he began to promote the career of a rival female pianist, Camilla Pleyel.\n\nIn July 1840, the court ruled against Wieck, and it gave consent to the marriage. Schumann then sued Wieck for slander and won. Wieck was forced to pay the couple a large sum, and he was sentenced to jail for 18 days for unruly courtroom behaviour, although it is not clear whether he actually served the sentence.\n\nClara and Robert married on September 12, 1840, the day before her twenty-first birthday. For several months Wieck refused to release to Clara the piano from the Wieck home on which she had played since childhood; finally he was forced to do so by court order. By 1843 Wieck was a grandfather, Clara having given birth to the first two of her eight children, and Schumann was winning a growing reputation as a serious composer.\n\nWieck invited Schumann to a reconciliation, writing, \"For Clara's sake and the world's, we can no longer keep each other at a distance. You too are now a family man – is a longer explanation needed?\". The reconciliation was welcomed by Clara, although Robert was less enthusiastic. However, Schumann must have enjoyed the way Wieck treated him in his essays from 1844 on: as a first-grade model for art, beside Chopin, Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy and Ignaz Moscheles. In 1844 Wieck was again involved in managing Clara's career, but by March 1850 he was promoting the musical career not of Clara but of her sister, Marie, as well as the singer Minna \"Schulz-Wieck,\" whom he falsely advertised as his daughter.\n\nWieck published a very positive review of Frédéric Chopin's Variations on \"La ci darem la mano\" in the German periodical, \"Caecilia\". Chopin found the review so embarrassingly cloying that he blocked Wieck's attempts to publish the review in French. In a letter to a friend, Chopin wrote that Wieck, \"instead of being clever, is very stupid\" and that he did not want his musical integrity to \"die\" because of \"the imagination of that ... stubborn German.\"\n\n"}

The SSSI is part of Chichester Harbour Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and Solent Maritime Special Area of Conservation. It is also part of Chichester and Langstone Harbours Ramsar site, Special Protection Area and Nature Conservation Review site, Grade I. Part of it is a Geological Conservation Review site and two areas are Local Nature Reserves. \nChichester Harbour is a large natural harbour to the south west of the city of Chichester on the Solent. It is one of four natural harbours in that area of the coastline, the others being Portsmouth Harbour, Langstone Harbour and Pagham Harbour. The harbour and surrounding land is managed by Chichester Harbour Conservancy. It is one of the few remaining undeveloped coastal areas in Southern England and remains relatively wild. Its wide expanses and intricate creeks are at the same time a major wildlife haven and among some of Britain's most popular boating waters.\n\nThe massive stretch of tidal flats and saltings are of outstanding ecological significance. Very large populations of wildfowl and waders use the mudflats feeding on the rich plant life and the huge populations of intertidal invertebrates. More than 7,500 Brent geese overwinter on the intertidal mud-land and adjacent farmland and around 55,000 birds reside in or visit the Harbour throughout the year.\n\nThe harbourside villages are: West Wittering, West Itchenor, Birdham, Dell Quay, Fishbourne, Bosham, Chidham, Prinsted, Thorney Island, Emsworth, Langstone and Northney. The nearest towns are Havant, Chichester and Hayling Island. The harbour lowlands contain high quality arable farmland. Boatyards, marinas and commercial fishing are important elements of the local economy.\n\nThis is one of the south coast's most popular sailing waters with as many as 12,500 craft regularly using the harbour, with competitive racing taking place among the 14 sailing clubs of the Chichester Harbour Federation. The villages, sea walls and footpaths are a popular leisure area for residents and tourists alike.\n\nSet up by Act of Parliament in 1971, Chichester Harbour Conservancy has the duty to conserve, maintain and improve the harbour and amenity area for recreation, natural conservation and natural beauty. As well as being the statutory harbour authority, the Conservancy manages the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).\n\nTo the south west of the entrance to Chichester Harbour is Chichester Bar, a shallow spit which can present a significant navigation hazard at all states of the tide. The entrance to the harbour is deep with a fast tidal stream and to the east of the main harbour entrance channel is a gravel bank known as The Winner.\n\nThe east side of the harbour entrance is an area of geographical, recreational and conservation interest known as East Head. It is a large sand dune linked to land by a narrow area known as The Hinge. In recent years The Hinge has been breached by several storms and then repaired. There is much debate about whether and how it should continue to be repaired.\n\nThe western boundary with Langstone Harbour is defined by a historic causeway known as the wade way, once the principal access from Hayling Island to the mainland, but since bisected by a deep channel for the Portsmouth and Chichester Canal in the 1820s, and no longer safely traversable.\n\nChichester Harbour has three main channels. The Emsworth Channel, the Thorney Channel and the Chichester Channel, which also branches off into the Bosham Lake and Itchenor Reach.\n\nThe harbour has diverse habitats, including intertidal mudflats, shingle, saltmarsh, sand dunes, marshes and woodland. The mudflats provide feeding grounds for internationally important numbers of ringed plovers, grey plovers, redshanks, black-tailed godwits, dunlins, sanderlings, curlews and greenshanks.

He was the long-time partner of Allen Ginsberg.\n\nOrlovsky was born in the Lower East Side of New York City, the son of Katherine (née Schwarten) and Oleg Orlovsky, a Russian immigrant. He was raised in poverty and was forced to drop out of Newtown High School in his senior year so he could support his impoverished family. After many odd jobs, he began working as an orderly at Creedmoor State Mental Hospital, known today as Creedmoor Psychiatric Center.\n\nIn 1953, Orlovsky was drafted into the United States Army for the Korean War at nineteen years old. Army psychiatrists ordered his transfer off the front to work as a medic in a San Francisco hospital. He later went to Columbia University.\n\nHe met Allen Ginsberg while working as a model for the painter Robert La Vigne in San Francisco in December 1954. Prior to meeting Ginsberg, Orlovsky had made no deliberate attempts at becoming a poet.\n\nWith Ginsberg's encouragement, Orlovsky began writing in 1957 while the pair were living in Paris. Accompanied by other beat writers, Orlovsky traveled extensively for several years throughout the Middle East, Northern Africa, India, and Europe. He also helped produce and contributed vocals to Ginsberg's 1970 LP \"Songs of Innocence and Experience\", based on William Blake's poetry collection of the same name. Orlovsky was Ginsberg's lover in an open relationship until Ginsberg's death in 1997.\n\nIn 1974, Orlovsky joined the faculty of the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at the Naropa Institute in Boulder, Colorado, teaching poetry. In 1979 he received a $10,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts to continue his creative endeavors.\n\nIn May 2010, friends reported that Orlovsky, who had had lung cancer for several months, was moved from his home in St. Johnsbury, Vermont, to the Vermont Respite House in Williston. He died there on May 30, 2010, from complications of the disease; he was 76 years old. He was buried at Shambhala Mountain Center in Red Feather Lakes, Colorado. His epitaph reads: \"Train will tug my grave, my breathe hueing gentil vapor between weel & track\".\n\nHis work has also appeared in \"The New American Poetry 1945–1960\" (1960), \"The Beatitude Anthology\" (1965), as well as the literary magazines \"Yugen\" and \"Outsider\". Orlovsky appeared in four films: Andy Warhol's \"Couch\" (1965) and in three films by photographer Robert Frank, \"Pull My Daisy\" (1959) (a partly improvised 26-minute-long film based on a Kerouac script), \"Me and My Brother\" (1969) (a film documenting his brother Julius Orlovsky's mental illness) and \"C'est Vrai!

{"id": "1919166", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1919166", "title": "Ham on Rye", "text": "Ham on Rye\n\nHam on Rye is a 1982 semi-autobiographical novel by American author and poet Charles Bukowski. Written in the first person, the novel follows Henry Chinaski, Bukowski’s thinly veiled alter ego, during his early years. Written in Bukowski’s characteristically straightforward prose, the novel tells of his coming-of-age in Los Angeles during the Great Depression.\n\nThe title may be a play on J. D. Salinger's 1951 book \"The Catcher in the Rye\", which is one of the most notable coming-of-age novels about American males. Both Bukowski and Salinger were first published professionally in the 1940s in the literary magazine \"Story\", edited by Whit Burnett. However, Bukowski's admiration of John Fante also suggests that a phrase in Fante's \"Ask the Dust\", \"liverwurst on rye,\" may have inspired the title \"Ham on Rye.\" A third possibility is that the title is a dig at the New York literary critics who generally disdained Bukowski's work, dismissing him as the equivalent of a ham actor with an overwrought, amateurish style. Thus, Bukowski may be appropriating the insult and boldly declaring himself a ham writer fueled by rye whiskey. Still another possible interpretation is that Hank perceived himself as being sandwiched, or trapped, between his highly dysfunctional parents during his formative years.\n\nLike his previous works, \"Ham on Rye\" is set in Los Angeles where the author grew up. Bukowski keeps his descriptions of his hometown grounded in reality, paying more attention to the people that make up Los Angeles than to the city itself. This type of description does not venerate or idealize the city, a contrast to other so-called \"Los Angeles Novels\". Scenes outside of Los Angeles show Chinaski as an intruder, as with an early scene where he and his family are chased out of an orange grove. The story takes place at home, at his different schools, at the doctor's office (for his never-ending acne treatments) and at various other locales around town.\n\nThe novel focuses on the protagonist, Henry Chinaski, between the years of 1920 and 1941. It begins with Chinaski's early memories. As the story progresses the reader follows his life through the school years and into young adulthood. Chinaski relates that he has an abusive father, and his mother does nothing to stop his father's abuse. She is, in fact, a victim of her husband's brutality as well. Henry is not athletic but wants to be and therefore tries hard to improve. Football is difficult for him, but he enjoys the violence that comes with it. He has only slightly better results in baseball. As Chinaski progresses through grammar school, the focus of Henry's attention is on sports, violence, and girls. As Henry grinds his way through Junior High School, he discovers the manifold pleasures of alcohol and masturbation. As Henry begins High School, his father, who is experiencing downward inter-generational socioeconomic mobility, makes him go to a private school where he fits in even less amongst all the well-heeled, spoiled rich kids with their flashy, colorful, convertible sports cars and beautiful girlfriends. To make matters worse, Chinaski develops horrible acne so severe that he has to undergo painful, and mostly ineffective, treatments, essentially becoming a human guinea pig for various experiments thought up by his uninterested doctors. The reader eventually follows Chinaski to college and reads of Henry's attempt to find a worthwhile occupation.\n\nLike his previous autobiographical novels, \"Ham on Rye\" centers on the life of Henry Chinaski, this time during his childhood and teenage years. Throughout the course of the novel, Bukowski develops his misanthropic anti-hero character that is seen in his other works like \"Post Office\" and \"Hollywood\". Chinaski, growing up poor in Los Angeles during the Great Depression, is shown developing into a sarcastic loner. This stems in large part from his home life, in which he is beaten frequently (often for no reason) by his father. He becomes alienated from the children at school simply for somehow being different in a way that none of them could ever coherently articulate. The post-facto rationalizations they concoct for their hostility, however, involve his inability to play sports and his being viscerally revolted by cruelty to animals, the latter being one of the favorite past-times of neighborhood men and boys alike. The grotesque-looking boils of his acne vulgaris will eventually turn their excuses for hating him into an ostracizing trifecta.\n\nChinaski has been compared to both Frankenstein's monster and Kafka's Gregor Samsa, because of his alienation and outcast resulting from his \"monstrous\" appearance. He often resorts to violence when confronted with those who alienate him, giving him a tough guy image to his peers. However, he rarely is completely confident with his own abilities and often second-guesses himself.\n\nAs a prequel to Bukowski’s previous novels, \"Ham on Rye\" depicts the origin and development of many of the reoccurring themes of his work as well as the persona of Henry Chinaski. \n\nSome of the major themes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike Henry, the rest of the Chinaskis are modeled after Bukowski’s own family. For example, Henry’s parents, like Bukowski’s, had met in Germany after World War I.\n\n\n\n"}

The method and aims of protection vary according to the importance of the resource and whether it has public or private status. Nearly 30 percent of the land mass of New Zealand is in public ownership and has some degree of protection; these areas include conservation parks, mainland islands, island reserves, marine reserves, and national parks.\n\nIn 1840 Governor Hobson was instructed that some Crown land was to be, \"reserved, for the use of the public at large, all tracts which are likely to be required for purposes of public health, utility, convenience, or enjoyment.\" The Public Reserves Act 1854 allowed the Crown to grant public utility reserves to provinces. The Public Domains Act 1860 covered domains in Auckland and Wellington and allowed the governor to buy other land. The Public Reserves Act 1877 extended the powers, as did the Public Reserves Act 1881, the Public Reserves and Domains Act 1908, the Public Reserves, Domains and National Parks Act 1928, the Reserves and Domains Act 1953 and now the Reserves Act 1977.\n\nThe Department of Conservation administers the majority of the publicly owned land in New Zealand that is protected for scenic, scientific, historic and cultural reasons, or set aside for recreational purposes. More than 80,000 km – nearly 30 percent of the nation's total area – is administered by the department. The main legislation controlling this is the Reserves Act 1977.\n\nThere are 13 national parks (excluding the disestablished Te Urewera National Park), covering almost 28,900 km, over 50 Conservation Parks covering some 18,000 km, about 3,500 reserves covering around 15,000 km, and some 610 km of protected private land and covenants that have been set aside for scenic, scientific or ecological reasons. The department also has responsibility for the preservation and management of wildlife, and has a role in management of the coastal marine area with 19 marine reserves and two other protected marine areas from the Kermadec Islands to Fiordland.\n\nAny development in Coastal Marine Areas, which extend up to the mean high water spring mark and up to a kilometre up rivers, require a Resource Consent under the Resource Management Act (RMA).\n\nConservation Parks defined in the Conservation Act 1987 to protect their natural and historic resources, and to facilitate public recreation and enjoyment. Prior to changes in 1987, many Conservation Parks were administered as \"Forest Parks\", before the Conservation Act declared that all such parks would automatically become Conservation Parks in a legal sense.\n\nOften referred to as \"Island Sanctuaries\" these off-shore islands have been set aside by organisations like the Department of Conservation as reserves for endemic and native New Zealand species:\n\n\nThe Department of Conservation have set up five mainland islands:\n\nNew Zealand has over three dozen marine reserves spread around the North and South Islands, and two on outlying island groups. The first marine reserve was created in 1975.\n\nThere are 13 national parks, covering just under 25,000 km.\n\n\nA national reserve is a reserve that has been designated as having national importance under section 16 of the Reserves Act 1977. Some have historic values and others have ecological values.\n\nRegional parks of New Zealand are administered by regional councils.\n\nScenic reserves are the most common protected area in New Zealand and most are relatively small – many are less than 1 square kilometre, though some are more than 10 square kilometres. Most scenic reserves are visually attractive remnant areas of native forest close to roads. Statutory control of scenic reserves was earlier provided by the Scenery Preservation Act 1903 and now by the Reserves Act 1977.\n\nEsplanade Reserves are strips of land beside the sea, rivers and lakes. They were usually wide when created; hence often known as the 'Queen's Chain'. s.229 of the RMA requires that esplanade reserves contribute to the protection of conservation values, by supporting the natural functioning of an adjacent waterway, its water quality, aquatic habitats, natural values, mitigating natural hazards, or allowing public access, proving access is compatible with conservation values. District Plans can set reserve widths and the size of subdivision for which they're required.\n\nLocal reserves can be created for, \"utility, road, street, access way, esplanade, service lane, playcentre, kindergarten, plunket room, or other like purpose\" They cover a wide range of purposes, many of them not for conservation, such as water reserves to protect reservoir catchments, quarry reserves, pilot reserves, and aerodrome reserves.\n\nNew Zealand is a signatory to the Ramsar Convention, and as of 2008 there are six Ramsar-registered sites in New Zealand:\n\nTravis Wetland is an ecological restoration project in Christchurch that was purchased by the city council as a nature reserve.\n\nThere are three World Heritage Sites in New Zealand:\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1919203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1919203", "title": "The Lady from Shanghai", "text": "The Lady from Shanghai\n\nThe Lady from Shanghai is a 1947 film noir directed by Orson Welles and starring Welles, his estranged wife Rita Hayworth and Everett Sloane. It is based on the novel \"If I Die Before I Wake\" by Sherwood King.\n\nAlthough \"The Lady from Shanghai\" initially received mixed reviews, it has grown in stature over the years, and many critics have praised its set designs and camerawork. In 2018, \"The Lady from Shanghai\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\n\nThe overall story is narrated by Orson Welles in a very unconvincing Irish accent.\n\nIrish sailor Michael O'Hara meets the beautiful blonde Elsa as she rides a horse-drawn coach in Central Park. Three hooligans waylay the coach. Michael rescues Elsa and escorts her home. Michael reveals he is a seaman and learns Elsa and her husband, disabled criminal defense attorney Arthur Bannister, are newly arrived in New York City from Shanghai. They are on their way to San Francisco via the Panama Canal. Michael, attracted to Elsa despite misgivings, agrees to sign on as an able seaman aboard Bannister's yacht.\n\nThey are joined on the boat by Bannister's partner, George Grisby, who proposes that Michael \"murder\" him in a plot to fake his own death. He promises Michael $5,000 and explains that since he would not really be dead and since there would be no corpse, Michael could not be convicted of murder (reflecting \"corpus delicti\" laws at the time). Michael agrees, intending to use the money to run away with Elsa. Grisby has Michael sign a confession.\nOn the night of the crime, Sydney Broome, a private investigator who has been following Elsa on her husband's orders, confronts Grisby. Broome has learned of Grisby's plan to murder Bannister, frame Michael, and escape by pretending to have also been murdered. Grisby shoots Broome and leaves him for dead. Unaware of what has happened, Michael proceeds with the night's arrangement and sees Grisby off on a motorboat before shooting a gun into the air to draw attention to himself. Meanwhile, Broome, mortally wounded but still alive, asks Elsa for help. He warns her that Grisby intends to kill her husband.\n\nMichael makes a phone call to Elsa, but finds Broome on the other end of the line. Broome warns Michael that Grisby was setting him up. Michael rushes to Bannister's office in time to see Bannister is alive, but that the police are removing Grisby's body from the premises. The police find evidence implicating Michael, including his confession, and take him away.\n\nAt trial, Bannister acts as Michael's attorney. He feels he can win the case if Michael pleads justifiable homicide. During the trial, Bannister learns of his wife's relationship with Michael. He ultimately takes pleasure in his suspicion that they will lose the case. Bannister also indicates that he knows the real killer's identity. Before the verdict, Michael escapes by feigning a suicide attempt (swallowing pain relief pills Bannister takes for his disability), causing a commotion in which he slips out of the building with the jury for another case. Elsa follows. Michael and she hide in a Chinatown theater. Elsa calls some Chinese friends to meet her. As Michael and Elsa wait and pretend to watch the show, Michael realizes that she killed Grisby. Michael passes out from the pills he took just as Elsa's Chinese friends arrive; they carry the unconscious Michael to an empty fun house. When he wakes, he realizes that Grisby and Elsa had been planning to murder Bannister and frame him for the crime, but that Broome's involvement ruined the scheme and that Elsa had to kill Grisby for her own protection.\n\nThe film features a unique climactic shootout in a hall of mirrors involving a multitude of false and real mirrored images in the Magic Mirror Maze, in which Elsa is mortally wounded and Bannister is killed. Heartbroken, and ignoring Elsa's pleas to save her life, Michael leaves presuming that events which have unfolded since the trial will clear him of any crimes. \"Maybe I'd forget her. Maybe I'd die trying\".\n\nIn the summer of 1946, Welles was directing a musical stage version of \"Around the World in Eighty Days\", with a comedic and ironic rewriting of the Jules Verne novel by Welles, incidental music and songs by Cole Porter, and production by Mike Todd, who would later produce the successful film version with David Niven.\n\nWhen Todd pulled out from the lavish and expensive production, Welles financed it. When he ran out of money and urgently needed $55,000 to release costumes which were being held, he convinced Columbia Pictures president Harry Cohn to send him the money to continue the show and in exchange Welles promised to write, produce and direct a film for Cohn for no further fee. As Welles tells it, on the spur of the moment, he suggested the film be based on a book that he happened to see in front of him during his call with Cohn, one a girl in the theatre box office was reading at the time. Welles had never read it. However, according to the daughter of William Castle, it was her father who had purchased the film adaptation rights for the novel and who then asked Welles to pitch it to Cohn, with Castle hoping to receive the directoral assignment himself. She described her father as greatly respecting Welles' talents, but feeling nonetheless disappointed at being relegated to serve merely as Welles' assistant director on the film.\n\n\"The Lady from Shanghai\" began filming on 2 October 1946, and originally finished filming on 27 February 1947, with studio-ordered retakes continuing through March 1947—but it was not released in the U.S. until 9 June 1948. Cohn strongly disliked Welles's rough cut, particularly what he considered to be a confusing plot and lack of close-ups (Welles had deliberately avoided these, as a stylistic device), and was not in sympathy with Welles's Brechtian use of irony and black comedy, especially in a farcical courtroom scene. He also objected to the appearance of the film—Welles had aimed for documentary-style authenticity by shooting one of the first major Hollywood pictures almost entirely on location (in Acapulco, Pie de la Cuesta, Sausalito and San Francisco) using long takes, and Cohn preferred the more tightly-controlled look of footage lit and shot in a studio. Release was delayed due to Cohn order for extensive editing and reshoots. Whereas Welles had delivered his cut of the film on time and under budget, the reshoots Welles was ordered to do meant that the film ended up over budget by a third, contributing to the director's reputation for going over budget. Once the reshoots were over, the heavy editing ordered by Cohn took over a year to complete; editor Viola Lawrence cut about an hour from Welles's rough cut. Welles was appalled at the musical score and particularly aggrieved by the cuts to the climactic confrontation scene in an amusement park funhouse at the end of the film. Intended as a climactic tour-de-force of editing and production design, the scene was cut to fewer than three minutes out of an intended running time of twenty. As with many of Welles's films over which he did not have control over the final cut, the missing footage has not been found and is presumed to have been destroyed. Surviving production stills show elaborate and expensive sets built for the sequence which were entirely cut from the film.\n\nWelles cast his wife Rita Hayworth as Elsa and caused controversy when he instructed her to cut her long red hair and bleach it blonde for the role. \"Orson was trying something new with me, but Harry Cohn wanted The Image—The Image he was gonna make me 'til I was 90,\" Rita Hayworth recalled. \"\"The Lady from Shanghai\" was a very good picture. So what does Harry Cohn say when he sees it? 'He's \"ruined\" you—he cut your hair off!'\"\n\nThe film was considered a disaster in America at the time of its release, though the closing shootout in a hall of mirrors has since become one of the touchstones of film noir. Not long after release, Welles and Hayworth finalized their divorce.\n\nA remake of the film came close to production at the turn of the century from a screenplay written by Jeff Vintar, based both on the Orson Welles script and the original pulp novel, produced by John Woo and Terence Chang, and starring Brendan Fraser, who wanted Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones to co-star. Although the screenplay was considered highly successful, and Fraser was coming off the highly praised \"Gods and Monsters\", the project was abandoned when the head of Sony Pictures, Amy Pascal, decided to concentrate on teen films.\n\nIn addition to the Columbia Pictures studios, the film was partly shot on location in San Francisco. It features the Sausalito waterfront and Sally Stanford's Valhalla waterfront bar and cafe, the front, interior, and a courtroom scene of the old Kearny Street Hall of Justice, and shots of Welles running across Portsmouth Square, escaping to a long scene in a theater in Chinatown, then the Steinhart Aquarium in Golden Gate Park, and Whitney's Playland-at-the-Beach amusement park at Ocean Beach for the hall of mirrors scene, for which interiors were shot on a soundstage.\n\nOther scenes were filmed in Acapulco.

He was originally drafted by the Carolina Panthers in the fourth round (121st overall) of the 2005 NFL Draft. He played collegiately at Louisville.\n\nIn 2003, LeFors became the starting quarterback for the Louisville Cardinals football team. In 2004, LeFors started every game that season. LeFors ranks as the 4th all-time leading passer at the University of Louisville with 5,853 yards & first in pass completion percentage with 66%. In 2004, he narrowly missed breaking Daunte Culpepper's season-record completion percentage with 73.5 to Culpepper's 73.6. He led Louisville that season to an 11-1 season in which they finished 6th in the final AP Poll (the highest finish in school history) and won the Liberty Bowl. Louisville was the only D-1A (now FBS) university to recruit LeFors out of high school as a quarterback. LeFors was redshirted as a freshman in 2000 and served as a backup to Dave Ragone in 2001 and 2002. In 2003, he took over as a starter, throwing for 3,145 passing yards and 17 touchdowns, and was named 1st team All-Conference USA Quarterback in both 2003 and 2004.

While the rest of the constitution theoretically assured the public freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and freedom of press these rights were rendered less meaningful by the reservation of article 6 that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was the \"leading and guiding force of the Soviet society\".\n\nThe text of the article follows in English translation.\n\nThe leading and guiding force of the Soviet society and the nucleus of its political system, of all state organisations and public organisations, is the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The CPSU exists for the people and serves the people. \n\nThe Communist Party, armed with Marxism-Leninism, determines the general perspectives of the development of society and the course of the home and foreign policy of the USSR, directs the great constructive work of the Soviet people, and imparts a planned, systematic and theoretically substantiated character to their struggle for the victory of communism. \n\nAll party organisations shall function within the framework of the Constitution of the USSR.\n\nThis provision was used to justify the banning of opposition parties, as well as harsh measures against opposition of any sort. The theory was that since the CPSU was the vanguard of the state, its right to rule could not be legitimately questioned.\n\nThe \"leading role\" of the CPSU was first enshrined in Article 126 of the Stalin Constitution, which described the Party as \"the vanguard of the working people in their struggle to strengthen and develop the socialist system and is the leading core of all organizations of the working people, both public and state.\" \n\nOn March 14, 1990 Article 6 was amended by the 3rd Extraordinary Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union, to read as follows:\n\nThe Communist Party of the Soviet Union, other political parties as well as labor, youth and other public organisations and mass movements, through their representatives elected to the Councils of People's Deputies and in other forms participate in the policy-making of the Soviet state, in the management of state and public affairs.\n\nThis move was introduced by Mikhail Gorbachev in tandem with the creation of the office of the president of the USSR (which he viewed largely as an office for himself), and as a means to formalize the transition to a multi-party political system. After the amending of Article 6 of the Constitution, the CPSU effectively lost its right to rule the Soviet Union's government apparatus; paving the way towards a Multi-party democracy.\n"}

{"id": "1919240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1919240", "title": "Catopsis berteroniana", "text": "Catopsis berteroniana\n\nCatopsis berteroniana , commonly known as the powdery strap airplant, is an epiphytic bromeliad thought to be a possible carnivorous plant, similar to \"Brocchinia reducta\", although the evidence is equivocal. Its native range is from southern Florida to southern Brazil. It generally grows on the unshaded twigs of trees, and has been shown experimentally to trap more insects in its tank than other bromeliads of comparable size. There are several other species in the genus, none of which is believed to be carnivorous.\n\n\"Catopsis berteroniana\" is an epiphytic insectivorous plant with elongate leaves. These erect leaves overlap to form tube-like structures characteristic of many tank bromeliads. Rainwater falls and lands in the tubes, forming pools of water called phytotelmata, an aqueous medium filled with copious amounts of nutrients available for the plant to absorb. This medium is slightly acidic, but very close to neutral; according to algae in bromeliads, the pH of the phytotelmata of \"Catopsis berteroniana\" is 6.8. This species has sessile glands located on the plant epidermis that are used to absorb nutrients. Other species of carnivorous plants, such as \"Cephalotus\" \"follicularis\", use these glands to secrete enzymes to break down detritus and trap prey. However, \"C. berteroniana\" lacks enzyme production, so this plant breaks down materials using other methods. An important feature located on the leaves of \"Catopsis berteroniana\" is the presence of a white powder. This powder is released from the leaves of the plant. It is very slippery and reflects ultraviolet light.\n\n\"Catopsis berteroniana\" is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on another host. However, the plant does not receive nutrients from its host via its roots. Instead, the roots attach to the tree in order to provide stability. In turn, nutrients are obtained from its leaves. According to Fish, 1976, plants have moved away from root absorption in relation to adaptations and moved toward foliar procurement and nutrient absorption.\n\n\"Catopsis berteroniana\" is found in the neotropics, from southern Florida to southern Brazil. It grows above the tree canopies where it is exposed to a high amount of sunlight. According to Fish, 1976, due to the location of \"Catopsis berteroniana\" above the tree canopies, this species dodges direct competition with other species because they do not need to receive any nutrients from the soil or tree canopies. In Everglades National Park in southern Florida, these plants were found at the apex of red mangroves and in areas of limited shade. One of the major reasons this species is restricted to the neotropics is because the phytotelmata are limited to humid environments. This is because the plant does not have enough energy available to make up for the excessive evaporation that occurs in very dry climates.\n\nPhytotelmata of \"Catopsis berteroniana\" serve as homes for many organisms, called inquilines. Many types of larvae develop in this medium. This is a very interesting feature because the major function of phytotelmata is to catch prey, not to support life forms. According to Adlassnig, Peroutka & Lendl, 2010, this plant hosts 11 inquiline species. \"Wyeomyia mitchellii\" is a species of mosquito that develops in the medium of the phytotelmata. It takes about 2 weeks for the larvae to fully develop. Once they develop, the mosquitoes can escape from the plant without getting trapped by the powder. Mutualism occurs between \"Catopsis berteroniana\" and these larvae: the plant provides a habitat for the larvae while the larvae help break down nitrogenous nutrients for faster absorption by the plant. There are also parasitic relationships that affect the bromeliad. \"Metamasius callizona\", a weevil, will feed on the meristematic tissue of the \"Catopsis\" species, which will inevitably kill the plant.\n\nOther organisms that use phytotelmata as a home are algae. These organisms are essential to the plant itself. There is an entire food web within the phytotelmata: through anemophilous nutrition, the plant obtains its nutrients from the wind. Algae use these nutrients to grow and then become a food source for other organisms. Sunlight is a major factor that determines algal growth within the tanks: an increase in transmitted light results in an increase in algal growth. It shapes the entire food web because algae make up 30% of the living carbon within the bromeliad tanks located in an area with a high amount of sunlight.\n\nTrapping prey is the main mechanism for obtaining nutrients for \"Catopsis berteroniana\". This species uses a passive trap, called a tank, to trap and digest the target. Because this species is insectivorous, the typical prey that get trapped are insects. The purpose of these traps is to obtain inorganic nutrients from the degradation of insects, most commonly nitrogen and phosphorus. This species is an epiphyte, so most of the insects that get caught in the trap are winged insects. They are lured to the plant by a white powder that is located on the leaves. This powder reflects UV light, so the insect sees the UV reflection better than visual light, because pollen reflects these wavelengths. The organism falls into the fluid where it cannot escape due to the slippery powder on the leaves. The fluid's purpose is to drown the organisms because most cannot survive in the fluid.\n"}

The martyrs take their name from Scilla (or Scillium), a town in Numidia. The \"Acts of the Scillitan Martyrs\" are considered to be the earliest documents of the church of Africa and also the earliest specimen of Christian Latin\".\"\n\nIt was the last of the persecutions during the reign of Marcus Aurelius, which is best known from the sufferings of the churches of Vienne and Lyon in South Gaul. Marcus Aurelius died on 17 March of the year in question, and persecution ceased sometime after the accession of his son Commodus. A group of sufferers called the Madaurian martyrs seems to belong to the same period: for in the correspondence of St Augustine, Namphamo, one of their number, is spoken of as \"archimartyr,\" which appears to mean protomartyr of Africa.\n\nThe martyrs' trial and execution took place in Carthage under the proconsul Publius Vigellius Saturninus, whom Tertullian declares to have been the first persecutor of Christians in Africa.\n\nThe Scillitan sufferers were twelve in all—seven men and five women. Their names were Speratus, Nartzalus, Cintinus (Cittinus), Veturius, Felix, Aquilinus, Laetantius, Januaria, Generosa, Vestia, Donata, and Secunda. Two of these bear Punic names (Nartzalus, Cintinus), but the rest are Latin names. Six had already been tried: of the remainder, to whom these \"Acta\" primarily relate, Speratus was the principal spokesman. He claimed for himself and his companions that they had lived a quiet and moral life, paying their dues and doing no wrong to their neighbors. But when called upon to swear by the name of the emperor, he replied \"I recognize not the empire of this world; but rather do I serve that God whom no man hath seen, nor with these eyes can see.\" The response was a reference to the language of 1 Tim. vi. 16. In reply to the question, \"What are the things in your satchel?\", he said \"Books and letters of Paul, a just man.\" The martyrs were offered a delay of 30 days to reconsider their decision, which they all refused. The fame of the martyrs led to the building of a basilica in their honor at Carthage and their annual commemoration required that the brevity and obscurity of their \"Acta\" should be supplemented and explained to make them suitable for public recitation.\n\nAgobard, archbishop of Lyons (c. 779–840) stated that the relics of Speratus, and those of Cyprian, were translated by Charlemagne's orders from Carthage to Lyons.\n\nThe historical questions connected with these martyrs were addressed by bishop Joseph Barber Lightfoot in \"Epistles of Ignatius and Polycarp\", 1885.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Both inhabit islands in the Gulf of Carpentaria, the Lardil on Mornington Island, the largest island of the Wesley Group, and the Yangkaal on the Forsyth Islands. Their languages belong to the same family, the Tangkic languages. Lardil is the most divergent of the Tangkic languages, while the others are mutually comprehensible with Yangkaal.\n\nThe Lardil word \"Demiin\" can be translated as \"being silent\".\n\nThe Lardil had two initiation ceremonies for men, namely \"luruku\", which involved circumcision, and \"warama\", which involved penile subincision. There were no ceremonies for women, although women did play an important role in these ceremonies, especially in the luruku ceremony.\n\nIt is sometimes said that Damin was a secret language, but this is misleading since there was no attempt to prevent the uninitiated members of the Leerdil tribe from overhearing it. However it was taught during the \"warama\" ceremony and, therefore, in isolation from the uninitiated. At least one elder is known, who, though not having been subincised, had an excellent command of Damin, but this seems to have been a unique case.\n\nDamin lexical words were organised into semantic fields and shouted out to the initiate in a single session. As each word was announced, a second speaker gave its Lardil equivalent. However, it normally took several sessions before a novice mastered the basics and could use Damin openly in the community. One speaker did claim to have learned to speak Damin in a single session, but on the other hand two senior \"warama\" men admitted that they lacked a firm command of the register.\n\nOnce Damin had been learned, the speakers were known as \"Demiinkurlda\" (\"Damin possessors\"). They spoke the register particularly in ritual contexts, but also in everyday secular life, when foraging, sitting about gossiping, and the like.\n\nDamin is the only click language outside Africa.\n\nDamin had a much more restricted and generic lexicon than everyday language. With only about 150 lexical roots, each word in Damin stood for several words of Lardil or Yangkaal. It had only two pronouns (\"n!a\" \"me\" (ego) and \"n!u\" \"not me\" (alter)), for example, compared to Lardil's nineteen, and had an antonymic prefix \"kuri-\" (\"jijuu\" \"small\", \"kurijijuu\" \"large\").\n\nGrammatically, the Damin registers of the Lardil and Yangkaal use all the grammatical morphology of those languages, and so therefore are broadly similar, though it does not employ the phonologically conditioned alternations of that morphology.\n\nDamin words have three of Lardil's four pairs of vowels, ; the fourth, , occurs in grammatical suffixes. Vowel length is not contrastive, but depends on the preceding consonant. Damin uses only some of the (pulmonic) consonants of everyday Lardil, but they are augmented by four other airstream mechanisms: lingual ingressive (the nasal clicks), glottalic egressive (a velar ejective), pulmonic ingressive (an indrawn lateral fricative), and lingual egressive (a bilabial 'spurt'). Even some of the pulmonic egressive consonants are exotic for the Australian context: fricatives, voiceless nasals, and bilabial trills. The consonants of Damin, in the practical orthography and IPA equivalents, are:\n§ These sounds are found in standard Lardil, but not in Damin, apart from grammatical words and suffixes.\n\n\"L*\" is described as \"ingressive with egressive glottalic release\".\n\nThere is no alveolar–retroflex distinction in Damin, with the possible exception of the clicks. (This distinction is neutralized word-initially in Lardil, as it is in most Australian languages.) However, Hale notes that the Damin alveolar and retroflex clicks (found in the pronouns \"n!aa, n!uu\" and in \"rn!aa, rn!ii\" respectively) might be in complementary distribution, and it is not clear that they are distinct sounds.\n\nSome of the consonants listed above only occur in clusters. only occurs as a coda. A derivational rule seems to be to pronounce all onset nasals as clicks; it is likely that is not a click because a velar click in the straightforward sense is not possible.\n\nDamin consonant clusters at the beginning of a word are \"p'ny\" , \"p'ng\" , \"fny\" , \"fng\" , \"fy\" , \"prpry\" , \"thrr\" . Words in normal Lardil may not begin with a cluster. However, Lardil has several clusters in the middle of words, and many of these are not found in Damin words, as Damin only allows \"n\" and \"rr\" in a syllable coda. (The attested stem\nmedial Damin clusters are \"rrd, rrth, rrk, rrb, jb\" (Hale & Nash 1997: 255), though \"j\" of \"jb\" is supposedly not allowed in that position. Other clusters, such as nasal–stop, are produced by Lardil grammatical suffixes.)\n\nHale & Nash posit that Damin syllables (not counting codas) may only be CVV or CCV. Purported CV syllables are restricted to C = , , , suggesting that these are underlyingly iterated consonants. Hale suggests they might be \"k2, ng2, l2\" (rather as is a realization of \"j2\" ) and also that \"thrr\" might be \"d2\" . (Note that transcription of vowel length is inconsistent, and the vocabulary given above does not follow these patterns.)\n\nNo consonant occurs before all three vowels. Known sequences are as follows. Note however that with only 150 roots in Damin, and several consonants and consonant clusters attested from only a single root, there are certain to be accidental gaps in this list.\n\nDamin is spoken by replacing the lexical roots of ordinary Lardil with Damin words. Apart from a leveling of grammatical allomorphs, the grammar remains the same. For example,\n\nSome vocabulary:\n\nAntonymic derivation with \"kurri-\":\n\nSpecific reference requires paraphrasing. For example, a sandpiper is called a 'person-burning creature' (\"ngaajpu wiiwi-n wuujpu\" human burn- animal) in reference to its role as a character in the Rainbow Serpent Story, while a wooden axe is 'wood that (negatively) affects honey' (\"m!iwu didi-i-n wiijpu\" honey affect- wood\")\n\nThere is some suggestion of internal morphology or compounding, as suggested by the patterns in the word list above. For example, \"m!iwu\" '(native) beehive, honey' and \"wum!i\" 'sp. mud crab' may derive from \"m!ii\" 'food' and \"wuu\" 'mud shell clam'.\n\nThe origin of Damin is unclear. The Lardil and the Yangkaal say that Damin was created by a mythological figure in Dreamtime. Hale and colleagues believe that it was invented by Lardil elders; it has several aspects found in language games around the world, such as turning nasal occlusives such as \"m\" and \"n\" into nasal clicks, doubling consonants, and the like. Evans and colleagues, after studying the mythology of both tribes, speculate that it was the Yangkaal elders who invented Damin and passed it to the Lardil.\n\nThe cultural traditions of the Lardil and Yangkaal have been in decline for several decades, and the Lardil and Yangkaal languages are nearly extinct. The last \"warama\" ceremony was held in the 1950s, so nowadays Damin is no longer in use by either the Yangkaal or the Lardil. However, recently a revival of cultural traditions has begun, and \"luruku\" has been celebrated. It remains to be seen whether \"warama\" ceremonies will also be reactivated.\n\n"}

It was first serialized in the magazine \" Pilote\", issues 126–168, in 1962.\n\nWhile stopping at the Roman Camp of Compendium, Prefect 'Odius Asparagus' wants one of the indomitable Gauls as a present for Julius Caesar. Because none of the others can be captured, Centurion Gracchus Armisurplus decides on Cacofonix the bard. Soldiers sent by the centurion, although driven away by Cacofonix's singing at first, counteract this by stuffing parsley in their ears and capture him easily. A young boy from the village raises the alarm to Asterix and Obelix, and the Gauls attack Compendium; but learn that the prefect has already left in his galley with Cacofonix.\n\nAsterix and Obelix therefore board a ship with Ekonomikrisis the Phoenician merchant, who agrees to take them to Rome after they save him from the pirates. In Rome, after Cacofonix has subjected the slaves in the prefect's galley to his bad singing, the prefect presents him to Julius Caesar; but when Caius Fatuous, the gladiators' trainer, declares Cacofonix unfit to serve as a gladiator, Caesar decides to throw the bard to the lions. Upon arrival in Rome, Asterix and Obelix befriend Instantmix (a Gaulish cook working in Rome) and visit the public baths. There, Caius Fatuous decides they would be perfect candidates for the gladiators' fights in the Circus Maximus, and he arranges to have them captured. That night, Asterix and Obelix visit Instantmix in his insula, where he identifies the location of Cacofonix. The next morning, the Gauls' first attempt at rescuing the bard fails when they raid the Circus prison and discover that Cacofonix has been transferred to a lower basement. Caius Fatuous has his men try to ambush them in groups of three, but Asterix and Obelix defeat them with ease, and apparently without taking notice.\n\nCaius Fatuous then offers a reward of 10,000 sestertii to any citizen who captures Asterix and Obelix; but the two of them volunteer as gladiators to infiltrate the following Games, and Fatuous places them in training under his assistant Insalubrius. Soon, the Gauls demoralize Insalubrius and irritate Caius Fatuous by having the other gladiators play guessing-games instead of training. Later, when Fatuous plans the Games to Julius Caesar, the Gauls go on a stroll, with Caius Fatuous (reluctantly) as their guide. On the eve before the games, Asterix and Obelix visit Cacofonix in his cell and inform him of their intentions to free him and the gladiators.\n\nThe next day, during the chariot races, Asterix and Obelix substitute themselves for an inebriated contestant, and win the race. As Cacofonix is put into the arena to be killed by the lions, he sings to the Romans, and thus frightens the lions into retreat; whereupon Caesar orders the gladiators' competition to begin. When Asterix, Obelix, and the gladiators introduce Caesar to their guessing-game, and Caesar insists on a martial contest, Asterix challenges a cohort of Caesar's own guard, and the two Gauls win easily. Seeing that the audience are amused, Caesar releases the three Gauls and grants them Fatuous as a prisoner. Soon afterwards, the four men meet back up with Ekonomikrisis, and Asterix surprises him and his men by having Caius Fatuous row the ship back to the Gaulish Village alone. After a brief journey (plus a second run in with the pirates, which sinks their ship), the Gauls arrive home and Ekonomikrisis keeps his promise to return Caius Fatuous to Rome. The villagers then celebrate the return of their heroes with a banquet, only with Cacofonix having to sit it out bound and gagged after offering to sing a song to celebrate his triumphant return.\n\nThis book is noteworthy in the Asterix series as the first in which Obelix says his famous catchphrase \"These Romans are crazy!\"\n\nAn audiobook of \"Asterix the Gladiator\" adapted by Anthea Bell and narrated by Willie Rushton was released on EMI Records \"Listen for Pleasure\" label in 1988.\n\n\nOn Goodreads, Asterix the Gladiator has a score of 4.19 out of 5.\n\nThis story was blended with \"Asterix the Legionary\" for the animated movie \"Asterix Versus Caesar\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1919263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1919263", "title": "Alec Bedser", "text": "Alec Bedser\n\nSir Alec Victor Bedser (4 July 1918 – 4 April 2010) was a professional English cricketer, primarily a medium-fast bowler. He is widely regarded as one of the best English cricketers of the 20th century.\n\nBedser played first-class cricket for Surrey from 1939 to 1960 alongside his identical twin brother Eric. He took 1924 first-class wickets in 485 matches. He played Test cricket for England from 1946 to 1955, taking 236 wickets in 51 Test matches. He passed Clarrie Grimmett's world record for Test wickets in 1953. He held the record until his final tally was passed by Brian Statham in 1963.\n\nAfter retirement as an active cricketer, Bedser became the chairman of selectors for the English national cricket team, and was the president of Surrey County Cricket Club. He was knighted in the 1997 New Year Honours.\n\nBedser was born in Reading, Berkshire, ten minutes after his identical twin brother Eric (1918–2006). His father was a bricklayer, but had been stationed in Reading with the Royal Air Force during the First World War. The brothers remained inseparable through their lives: they often dressed identically, and shared a bank account; neither married.\n\nWithin six months the family moved to Horsell, Surrey, where, at the age of seven, the brothers played their first organised cricket. The family moved to Knaphill, Surrey and then to a house they helped their father to build in Woking. They were educated at Maybury Junior School and then Monument Hill Central School in Woking. Over the next decade, the twin brothers played cricket together for Monument Hill School and Woking Cricket Club. They also both played football for Monument Hill School, both as full backs.\n\nAfter leaving school, Eric and Alec became clerks at the same firm of solicitors in Lincoln's Inn Fields. They were spotted practising in the nets for Woking Cricket Club by Surrey coach Alan Peach, and he recruited them to the staff at the Oval in 1938. Initially, they were both medium-fast bowlers, but (after Alec won a toss of a coin) Eric became an off spinner instead. They made their first-class débuts for Surrey against Oxford University in June 1939.\n\nTheir cricket careers were soon interrupted by the outbreak of the Second World War. They both joined the RAF police, and were sent to France with the British Expeditionary Force. They both narrowly escaped being shot before being evacuated from Dunkirk, and later served in North Africa, Italy and Austria.\n\nEric was promoted to Warrant Officer, but Alec refused a similar promotion, staying a flight sergeant so they could continue to serve together. They were demobilised in 1946.\n\n\"Alec Bedser founded England's eventual success. He toiled for hours without complaint, and never once looked annoyed at the missing of a catch, or at a rejected l.b.w. appeal. A great bowler, and an example to all who aspire to cricketing fame. The schoolboys who cheered him, and the elderly folk who applauded politely, all realised one thing. In Alec Bedser England had the best bowler Australia had seen for years, and friend and foe alike admitted the fact.\"\nAlec Bedser's performances during war-time cricket matches were impressive: in games for the RAF he took 6 wickets for 27 runs (including a hat-trick) against the West Indies and 9 for 36, featuring another hat-trick, against a Metropolitan Police team.\nIn his first full season for Surrey, in 1946, he passed 100 wickets before July and established himself as a bowler in the England Test team. In each of his first two Tests, against the visiting Indians, he took eleven wickets: 11 for 139 in his début at Lord's, including 7 in the first innings, and 11 for 96 in the next game at Old Trafford, Manchester. His amazing season resulted in his nomination as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year for 1947. He was selected for the 1946–47 Ashes series in Australia and for most of the next decade \"carried England's bowling attack\".\n\nIn Australia he was overbowled and exhausted and found that his natural in-swingers were liked by Australian leg-side batsmen like Sid Barnes. To counter this he gripped the ball across the seam like a spinner and the result was an in-swinging leg-break which would be known as Bedser's \"Special Ball\". Don Bradman wrote \"the ball with which Alec Bedser bowled me in the Adelaide Test Match was, I think, the finest ever to take my wicket. It must have come three-quarters of the way straight on my off-stump, then suddenly dipped in to pitch on the leg stump, only to turn off the pitch and hit the middle and off stumps.\"\n\nMeanwhile, his brother Eric became an all-rounder in the Surrey team, concentrating on his batting as the team also included spinners such as Jim Laker and Tony Lock. The two were difficult to tell apart, both 6'3\" tall and just over 15 stone. Playing for Surrey against an England representative team in 1946, they are reputed to have shared an over – Alec bowling the first three balls and then swapping with Eric fielding at mid-on for Eric to complete the over – without being detected by the batsman, Frank Woolley.\n\nIn the 1950-51 Ashes series, Alec began his dominance of Australian batsmen, taking 30 wickets at an average of 16.06 and 10 for 105 in the Fifth Test when he ended Australia's unbeaten run of 26 Tests since 1938. In 1953 at 35, an age by which many fast bowlers have retired from first-class cricket, Bedser demonstrated his longevity by helping England regain the Ashes. He took 39 wickets at an average of 17.48 at home to Australia, including career-best match figures of 14 for 99 in the Nottingham Test.\n\nBedser founded his success on accuracy of line and length, bowled at a medium pace from a short run-up, using his powerful shoulders and large hands to achieve sharp inswing and surprising batsmen with occasional leg cutters.\nBedser was aged 36 by the first Test of the 1954–55 tour of Australia. He took 1 for 131 as seven catches were dropped off his bowling, including Arthur Morris (153) before he had scored – and England lost by an innings. He was subsequently diagnosed as suffering from shingles and despite a recovery and a green wicket tailor-made for his bowling in the second Test he was dropped from the side, and watched as the younger Frank Tyson and Brian Statham bowled England to victory. He was recalled for one Test against South Africa in 1955.\n\nIn a Test career extending from 1946 to 1955, Bedser played 51 matches and took 236 wickets (average 24.89), at the time the most wickets taken in Test cricket. He was England's post-war bowling spearhead. He had 14 new ball partners, and took five wickets in an innings 15 times and ten wickets in a match 5 times. His entire first-class career spanned 485 matches, in which he helped Surrey to eight County Championships between 1950 and 1958. Bedser occasionally captained the side in place of Stuart Surridge or Peter May. He took 100 wickets in a county season eleven times, figures that place him high amongst the game's greats. He took five or more wickets in an innings 96 times, and ten wickets or more in a match 16 times. Bedser retired from cricket in 1960, and his brother Eric retired in 1962.\n\nAfter retiring from playing cricket, Bedser went into business with his brother. Among other business interests, they co-operated with Ronald Straker in a successful stationery firm, Straker-Bedser, which was later taken over by Ryman in 1977.\n\nBedser served as a national team selector from 1962 to 1985, and was chairman of selectors from 1968 to 1981. He was on the board of selectors who controversially left Basil d'Oliveira out of the England team for 1968's tour of South Africa. England won ten of the 18 series while Bedser was chairman of selectors. Bedser also managed two England overseas tours. Bedser was made president of Surrey in 1987 in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the county's cricketing fortunes over the previous five decades. He was knighted for his services to cricket in the 1997 New Year Honours. In October 2004 Bedser was selected in 'England's Greatest Post-War XI' by The Wisden Cricketer, an authoritative monthly cricket magazine. In May 2009, Christopher Martin-Jenkins ranked Bedser 29th in picking his 100 greatest cricketers of all time.\n\nOutside of cricket, Bedser was a founding member of the right-wing pressure group, the Freedom Association during the 1970s, which advocated the maintenance of sporting relations with South Africa during the apartheid era.\n\nHe was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1964, advanced to Commander (CBE) in 1982, and in 1996 he became the first (and still only) England bowler to be knighted for services to cricket.\n\nNeither Alec nor his brother Eric ever married. They lived together in Woking until Eric's death in 2006. Sir Alec Bedser died in hospital in Woking on 4 April 2010 after a short illness. Among those to pay tribute to the more famous of the two brothers was former Prime Minister, well-known cricket lover and lifelong Surrey supporter John Major, who said: \"Alec Bedser was one of the greatest medium-fast bowlers of all time. He was also one of the great thinkers about cricket and his wisdom was one of the great untapped resources of the modern game.\" For three months following the death of Arthur McIntyre on 26 December 2009, Bedser was the oldest surviving England Test cricketer. On Bedser's death, that distinction passed to Reg Simpson.\n\nTest debut: vs India, Lord's, Middlesex, 1946<br>\nLast Test: vs South Africa, Old Trafford, Manchester, 1955\n\n\nIn the 1980s UK TV sitcom \"Chance in a Million\", the main character Tom Chance (played by Simon Callow) has a fascination with Bedser and one of his prized possessions is a cricket bat autographed by him. In the episode \"Honour Thy Father And Thy Mother\" (17 September 1984), the bat is mauled by a dog off-screen, much to Chance's annoyance.\n\n"}

G. Buzzard. Before that it was the Geography Club at Illinois State Normal University. After three years letters were sent out to other geography clubs suggesting the formation of a national fraternity.\n\nOn May 15, 1931, the organization, consisting of four chapters, was announced. On March 5, 1936, Gamma Theta Upsilon was incorporated, then with ten chapters, as a professional fraternity in geography under the laws of Illinois.\n\nGamma Theta Upsilon became an International Honorary Geographical Society in January 1969. The organization is a college honor society, and has been a member of the Association of College Honor Societies since 1976.\n\nThe badge of Gamma Theta Upsilon is a key, significant of achievement of quality in a field of science. The symbolism of the key is as follows:\n\nThe base or body of the key is a seven sided shield, the bevel of which carries on each side the initial of one of the great land masses of the earth. Beginning with Europe at the top, to the right is Asia, Africa and Australia, the great land masses of the Old or Eastern World.

A petition for a new chapter must be submitted by the faculty member who will serve as chapter sponsor or by the department chair and a letter of support from the department chair (if not the petitioner) or an appropriate administrator is required. An on-line form is available at http://www.gammathetaupsilon.org/petition-for-charter.html.

{"id": "1919281", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1919281", "title": "Angostura bitters", "text": "Angostura bitters\n\nAngostura bitters () is a concentrated bitters (herbal alcoholic preparation) based on gentian, herbs, and spices, by House of Angostura in Trinidad and Tobago. It is typically used for flavouring beverages or, less often, food. The bitters were first produced in the town of Angostura (now Ciudad Bolívar, Venezuela), hence the name, but do not contain angostura bark. The bottle is recognisable by its distinctive over-sized label. \"Angostura\" is Spanish for \"narrowing\", the town of Angostura having been located at the first narrowing of the Orinoco River.\n\nThe recipe was developed as a tonic by , a German surgeon general in Simón Bolívar's army in Venezuela. Siegert began to sell it in 1824 and established a distillery for the purpose in 1830. Siegert was based in the town of Angostura and used locally available ingredients, perhaps aided by botanical knowledge of the local Amerindians. The product was sold abroad from 1853, and in 1875 the plant was moved from Ciudad Bolivar to Port of Spain, Trinidad, where it remains. Angostura won a medal at the Weltausstellung 1873 Wien. The medal is still depicted on the over-sized label, along with reverse which shows Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria in profile.\n\nThe exact formula is a closely guarded secret, with only one person knowing the whole recipe, passed hereditarily.\n\nSince 2007, Angostura has also produced Angostura Orange, an orange bitters with bright floral notes and fresh orange peel. Angostura Orange has not dominated the orange bitters market in the same way that its aromatic bitters have become a go-to product for bars and consumers.\n\nIn 2009 there was a shortage of Angostura bitters; the company reported that this was caused primarily by a problem in their supply of bottles. There were incorrect rumours of a product recall, or that production of the bitters had stopped at the plant in Trinidad. The shortage was the subject of many news articles and blogs, particularly in the cocktail industry.\n\nAngostura bitters are extremely concentrated and may be an acquired taste; though 44.7% alcohol by volume, bitters are not normally ingested undiluted, but instead are used in small amounts as flavouring.\n\nAngostura bitters are alleged to have restorative properties. Angostura bitters is often incorrectly believed to have poisonous qualities because it is associated with angostura bark (although it does not actually contain any), which, although not toxic, during its use as a medicine was often adulterated by unscrupulous sellers, who padded out the sacks of bark with cheaper, poisonous \"Strychnos nux-vomica\" or copalchi bark. Angostura is still often used by Trinidadians to treat digestive problems, under the assumption that the containing gentian may aid indigestion.\n\nAngostura bitters are a key ingredient in many cocktails. Originally used to help with upset stomachs of the soldiers in Simón Bolívar's army, it later became popular in soda water and was usually served with gin. The mix stuck in the form of a pink gin, and is also used in many other cocktails such as long vodka, consisting of vodka, bitters, and lemonade. In the United States, it is best known for its use in whiskey cocktails: old fashioneds, made with whiskey, bitters, sugar, and water, and Manhattans, made usually with rye whiskey and red vermouth. In a pisco sour, a few drops are sprinkled on top of the foam, both for aroma and decoration. In a champagne cocktail, a few drops of bitters are added to a sugar cube.\n\nIn Hong Kong, Angostura bitters are included in the local gunner cocktail. Though not in the classic recipe, bartenders sometimes add more flavour to the mojito cocktail by sprinkling a few drops of Angostura bitters on top. Bitters can also be used in \"soft\" drinks; a common drink served in Australian and New Zealand pubs is lemon, lime and bitters. In Malawi, bitters are added to a mix of crushed ice, ginger ale, and Sprite to make a rock shandy.\n\nAmong certain bartending communities (especially in Malaysia), shots of Angostura are taken as the \"bartender's handshake\" either during or after the shift is done.\n\nThe largest purveyor of Angostura bitters in the world is Nelsen's Hall Bitters Pub on Washington Island off the northeast tip of Door Peninsula in Door County, Wisconsin. The pub began selling shots of bitters as a \"stomach tonic for medicinal purposes\" under a pharmaceutical license during Prohibition in the United States. The practice, which helped the pub to become the oldest continuously operating tavern in Wisconsin, remained a tradition after the repeal of Prohibition. As of 2018, the pub hosts a Bitters Club, incorporates bitters into food menu items, and sells upwards of 10,000 shots per year.\n\n\n\n"}

They comprised the almshouses, a hall and chapel, and the library added to the foundation by Dr John Simson, rector of St Olave Hart Street, one of White's executors. There were also, at least originally, apartments for students. The site was bounded by London Wall, Philip Lane, and Gayspur Lane (now Aldermanbury), roughly where Aldermanbury Square now stands. The first Court (committee) from 1630 consisted of John Gifford (President), Thomas Worrall and John Simson (Deans), and Francis Dee, Cornelius Burges, Edward Abbott and Thomas Wood (Assistants).\n\nIn the 1640s Sion College was regarded as a stronghold of the London presbyterians, their \"de facto headquarters\", and it took on a collective role from around 1645. The administration of the College fell into the hands of the parliamentarian side during 1643, as John Sedgwick of St Alphage London Wall took on the royalists President James Marsh, archdeacon of Chichester, and Edward Sparke. A work from 1646 by Anthony Burges claimed support from College members including the President Arthur Jackson, There were attacks on the College by the Independents John Goodwin (\"Sion-Colledg visited\" and \"Neophytopresbyteros\") and John Price (1625?–1691) (\"The Pulpit Incendiary\", 1648), and it was defended by Cornelius Burges (\"Sion College what it is, and doeth\", 1648). William Jenkyn also attacked Goodwin (\"The Busie Bishop, or the Visitor Visited\", and \"The Blind Guide, or Doling Doctor\", 1648).\nFrom 1647 to 1659 the provincial synod met there, leading to the name \"Sion College Conclave\"; There was a practical distinction, the London Provincial Assembly consisting of elders rather than all ministers. The first synod took particular aim at John Milton's divorce tracts, beginning a polemic relationship with Milton. The \"Serious and Faithfull Representation\" (January 1649) of 47 London ministers, a work against Oliver Cromwell, arose from an assembly in the College; Milton's \"The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates\" from February of that year is in part an answer, and snipes at the ministers.\nThe College was badly damaged in the Great Fire of London. In 1884 the almshouses were abolished, and the almsfolk became out-pensioners. It was subsequently found possible to extend their numbers from the original number of two men and two women to 40 in all, and to increase the pension. In 1886 Sion College was moved to new buildings at 56 Victoria Embankment, between Carmelite Street and John Carpenter Street. It became principally known for its theological library which served as a lending library to members of the college, and was accessible to the public. A governing body appointed by the members to administer the foundation includes a president, two deans and four assistants.\n\nIn 1996, the college disposed of its large Victorian premises on the banks of the River Thames. The building has been converted into offices. The library was closed June 1996, with the manuscripts, pamphlets, and pre-1850 printed books going to Lambeth Palace Library, and newer books to The Maughan Library, King's College London. Its activities now take place in a variety of locations.\n\nSource: Pearce, Appendix A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n"}

{"id": "1919297", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1919297", "title": "Mama (Spice Girls song)", "text": "Mama (Spice Girls song)\n\n\"Mama\" is a song by the British girl group the Spice Girls. It was written by the Spice Girls, Matt Rowe and Richard Stannard, and produced by Rowe and Stannard for the group's debut album \"Spice\", released in November 1996. \"Mama\" is a pop ballad that features instrumentation from keyboards, a rhythm guitar, a cello, and a violin, and its lyrics deal with the difficulties in relationships between mothers and daughters that appear during their childhood.\n\nIt was released as a double A-side with \"Who Do You Think You Are\", and became the official single of the 1997 Comic Relief. Its Big TV! directed music video, featured the group singing to an audience of children and their own mothers. Despite receiving mixed reviews from music critics, \"Mama\" was commercially successful. Released as the album's fourth single in March 1997, it became their fourth consecutive number-one single in the United Kingdom, which made the Spice Girls the first act in UK chart history to have its first four singles reach number one. It was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). The single performed well internationally, reaching the top ten in many European countries and New Zealand, and the top fifteen in Australia.\n\n\"Mama\" was written by the Spice Girls with songwriting partners Matt Rowe and Richard Stannard. In an interview about the writing process between the group and the duo, Rowe credits Mel B as the one who came up with the song's concept. During the writing process, each member wrote a small verse in a different corner of the recording studio, while the chorus was finished around the piano with a guitar. Then, the producers added a gospel choir filled with the group's harmonies at the end of the song. Brown explained the song's inspiration on the book \"Real Life: Real Spice The Official Story\":\nWe wrote 'Mama' when I was going through a bad phase with my mum. The sentiments are really that your mum's probably the best friend that you've got. Whether she's an over-protective mother or a bit of a landmine, she probably knows you better than yourself in some ways.\nIn the same book, Melanie C further elaborated: \"'Mama's all about how you're such a cow to your mum when you're going through that rebellious teenage stage. Then when you get a bit older, you realise that whatever she was doing, she was only doing it for your own good. And you think: 'God, I was really horrible.'\" \"Mama\" was released in the UK and Ireland as a double A-side along with \"Who Do You Think You Are\" in March 1997, timed not only for the Comic Relief telethon, but also for Mothering Sunday.\n\n\"Mama\" is a pop ballad, written in the key of Ab Major, it is set in the time signature of common time and moves at a moderate tempo of 100 beats per minute. The song is constructed in a verse-chorus form, with a bridge before the third chorus, and its instrumentation comes from keyboards, a rhythm guitar, a cello, and a violin.\n\nIt opens with an instrumental introduction, with a chord progression of D–E–Fm–E/G–A, that is used in the entire song. Bunton and Brown sing the first and second verse respectively. The bridge and third chorus follow. Then a choir, arranged by Mark Beswick, supplements the group during the last part of the song. \"Mama\" ends with the group repeating the chorus until the song gradually fades out. Lyrically, the song deals with the difficulties in the relationships between mothers and teenagers that appears during the adolescence, and it was dedicated to the group's mothers.\n\n\"Mama\" received mixed reviews from music critics. The \"Daily Mirror\" criticised the song saying \"Yuk! We don't want our Spice Girls sweet, ta very much. They should concentrate on the raunch and let Daniel O'Donnell take care of the mums.\" Dev Sherlock of Yahoo! Music Radio called it a \"glossy ballad that would do Mariah Carey proud\". Edna Gundersen of the \"USA Today\" said that their album \"Spice\" \"is assembly-line dance-pop\", adding that \"only the funky 'Say You'll Be There' and touchingly cornball 'Mama' hint at depth\".\n\nIn a review of their album \"Spice\", Ken Tucker from \"Entertainment Weekly\" called it \"a fearlessly corny ballad\", and added that it \"will likely keep them from being one-hit wonders in America\". Melissa Ruggieri of the \"Richmond Times-Dispatch\" said that in the song, the girls \"are sunny vocalists who harmonize with perfumey sweetness when called upon\". Daniel Incognito of Sputnikmusic said that in \"Mama\" the group \"sing with heartfelt emotion\", and added that \"their somewhat amateurish singing is brought up and pushed along by the production crew, harmonising nicely into a stirring pop hook\".\n\n\"Mama\" was released in the UK as a double A-side single with \"Who Do You Think You Are\" on 3 March 1997. It debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number one, with sales of 248,000 copies, becoming the group's fourth consecutive chart-topper. This achievement made the Spice Girls the first act in UK chart history to have its first four singles reach number one, breaking the record set by Gerry & The Pacemakers, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Jive Bunny and the Mastermixers, and Robson & Jerome with three number ones each. It spent three weeks at number one, nine weeks in the top forty, fifteen weeks in the top seventy-five, and sold 786,000 copies as of May 2019, earning a platinum certification by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI).\n\n\"Mama\" was commercially successful in Europe. It peaked at number three on the Eurochart Hot 100, and performed similarly in other European charts. It became the group's third number-one single in Ireland, and peaked inside the top ten in Belgium (both the Flemish and French charts), Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland. \"Mama\" was released as a standalone single in Austria, Finland, and Italy. In Austria, it was released on 23 March 1997, debuting on the Ö3 Austria Top 40 at number thirty-one. It peaked at number one in its ninth week, and remained fifteen weeks on the chart.\n\nIn Oceania, its commercial performance was generally positive, though not as overwhelming as their three first singles. In New Zealand, it debuted on 23 March 1997 at number ten, while their three first singles were slowly descending from the chart. It peaked at number six and stayed fifteen weeks on the chart. In Australia, it did not perform as well as their previous releases. On 27 July 1997, it debuted on the singles chart at number thirteen, but was unable to reach a higher position and dropped off the chart after fourteen weeks.\n\nThe music video for \"Mama\" was directed in February 1997 by Big TV!, and filmed in a studio in Ealing, London. It features the group singing to an audience of children and their own mothers. The video alternated between this scenes and shots of child actors playing younger versions of the Spice Girls doing various things all together, such as playing and practicing singing and dancing, though none of the group's members grew up together. It also shows each mother of the girls holding a picture of their daughter.\n\nAbout the shoot, Victoria Beckham commented: \"It took such a long time to film the 'Mama' video, but it was nice that our mums were there and could see what we're doing. It's good, because they were actually knackered at the end of the day and I said to my mum: 'Ha! Now you know how I feel every day!\" Geri Halliwell commented: \"I found it a bit bizarre bringing my mum to work with me on the 'Mama' video. You know: 'This is what I do—come and do it, too.' If you worked in Sainsbury's, you wouldn't get your mum to sit with you on the till\".\n\nThe song was performed many times on television, including \"An Audience with...\", \"Live & Kicking\", \"Top of the Pops\", the 1997 Prince's Trust Gala, and the 1997 Comic Relief. In October 1997, the group performed it as the thirteenth song of their first live concert at the Abdi İpekçi Arena in Istanbul, Turkey. The performance was broadcast on Showtime in a pay-per-view event titled \"Spice Girls In Concert Wild!\". However, the VHS and DVD release of the concert, \"Girl Power! Live in Istanbul\", does not include the performance. The song was also used during the climax of their 1997 film, \"Spice World\". In the scene, the group performs \"Mama\" at London's Royal Albert Hall, surrounded by the media and thousands of fans. The scene was included as a bonus performance in the VHS and DVD release of the movie.\n\nThe group have performed the song on their four tours, the Spiceworld Tour, the Christmas In Spiceworld Tour, the Return of the Spice Girls Tour and the Spice World - 2019 Tour. It remained in the group's live set after Halliwell's departure at the end of the European leg of the Spiceworld Tour. The performance at the tour's final concert can be found on the video: \"Spice Girls Live at Wembley Stadium\", filmed in London, on 20 September 1998. During the Return of the Spice Girls tour, \"Mama\" was performed as the second song from the show's fifth segment. All five girls stood together holding hands to perform it, while the LED screens in the background showed photos of their mothers holding baby pictures of the group, and a montage of them and their children. For the British shows, fifty young girls from the Capital Children's Choir dressed in white came out from a platform and lined the stage against the backdrop screens to sing with the Spice Girls.\n\nThese are the formats and track listings of major single releases of \"Mama\":\n\n\n\n\n\nPublished by Windswept Pacific Music Ltd/PolyGram Music Publishing Ltd.\n\n"}

He was the elder identical twin brother of Alec Bedser (1918–2010), widely regarded as one of England's top bowlers of the 20th century. Eric was an all-rounder, a useful right-handed batsman and right-arm off-spin bowler.\n\nEric Bedser was born in Reading, Berkshire 10 minutes before his twin brother Alec. The twins were regarded as 'inseparable' throughout their lives, and they often dressed identically. Their father served in the Royal Flying Corps in the First World War, later becoming a bricklayer. He also played cricket and football.\n\nThe Bedser brothers began playing cricket together at age seven for local school sides and Woking Cricket Club. Both twins also played football for Surrey Boys, and considered a professional career in that sport. They were educated at Maybury Junior School and Monument Hill Central School. From the age of 14, the twins worked as clerks at a solicitor's office in Lincoln's Inn Fields. They were spotted by Surrey coach Alan Peach in 1938 and joined the Surrey county squad staff at the Oval, making their first-class debuts in the same match in June 1939. There is a famous story that when Eric and Alec were first selected for Surrey, they agreed they couldn't both be fast bowlers, as at that time they were. A flip of the coin saw Alec win the toss, and Eric consequently took up off-spin bowling, at which he became very adept in a Surrey county team that was dominated by famous spinners such as Jim Laker and Tony Lock, and concentrated on his batting.\n\nThe pair were called up for duty with the Royal Air Force in 1939, serving in France and being evacuated from Dunkirk. They later served variously together throughout the war, in North Africa and Italy. Eric was promoted to Warrant Officer (and Alec refused a similar promotion, staying a flight sergeant so they could stay together), and both being demobilised in 1946, and returned to cricket at Surrey.\n\nBedser enjoyed a successful first-class career, a member of the Surrey team that won seven successive County Championships from 1952 to 1958, despite many of the side's best players being away playing for England. Despite being called to a Test Trial in 1950, in which Laker took 8 wickets for 2 runs, one of which was scored by Eric, he was never called to play in a Test himself: he played for England only once, in a first-class tour match in Tasmania. As a result, Eric's record will always be lacking when compared with Alec's, who played in 51 Test matches, although Eric often accompanied Alec on overseas tours.\n\nIn a first-class career that lasted twenty-three years, Bedser played in 457 matches for Surrey, scoring 14,716 runs at the useful batting average of 24.00, and taking 833 wickets at the good bowling average of 24.95. He passed 1,000 runs in six seasons.\n\nAfter retiring from playing cricket he went into business with his brother. Among other business interests, they co-operated with Ronald Straker in a successful stationery firm, Straker-Bedser, which was later taken over by Ryman in 1977. While Alec became a selector for England, Eric served on various committees at Surrey.

It emphasized human dignity and equality among all people, and made mention of issues such as the rights of women, nuclear non-proliferation, and the United Nations, all of which it endorsed. It was the last encyclical drafted by John XXIII, who had been diagnosed with cancer in September 1962 and died two months after the encyclical's completion. Biographer Peter Hebblethwaite called it Pope John's \"last will and testament\". Published on Holy Thursday, the Pope called it his \"Easter gift\".\n\nDue to its importance and popularity, \"Pacem in Terris\" is deposited at the UN archives.\n\nThe full title of the encyclical is \"On Establishing Universal Peace in Truth, Justice, Charity and Liberty\". The short title \"Pacem in terris\" is derived from the opening words of the encyclical, as is customary with papal documents:\n\n\"Pacem in terris\" was the first encyclical that a pope addressed to \"all men of good will\", rather than only to Catholics, quoting the praise to God as said by the heavenly army above the manger of Bethlehem (Latin Vulgate: \"in terra pax in hominibus bonae voluntatis\", Luke ; English translation: ). Learned Hand Professor of Law at Harvard Law School, Mary Ann Glendon, interprets this to mean, \"He was insisting that the responsibility for setting conditions for peace does not just belong to the great and powerful of the world—it belongs to each and every one of us.\" In theological terms, it marked a major shift in papal teaching from reliance on classical scholastic categories of natural law to a more inductive approach based on the signs of the times.\n\nIn this work, John XXIII reacted to the political situation in the middle of the Cold War. Coming just months after the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, during which the Vatican served as an intermediary between the White House and the Kremlin, the document also reflected the Pope's experience of 1960 in trying to resolve difficulties arising out the four-power occupation of Berlin. The \"peace encyclical\" was issued only two years after the erection of the Berlin Wall. It also draws on Pope John's reading of Saint Augustines \"The City of God\" and Thomas Aquinas' view of Eternal Law. In this it echoes the Gospel's core values and principles of patristic and medieval thought, while reflecting the historical period in which it was written.\n\nSociologist Monsignor Pietro Pavan and a small group of theologians helped draft it. In Pavan's view \"Pacem in terris\" would present the teachings of Leo XIII on the eternal law, \"in light of the changing tides of history, and allow them to resonate with a much wider audience\".\n\nThe Pope explains in this encyclical that conflicts \"should not be resolved by recourse to arms, but rather by negotiation\". He further emphasizes the importance of respect of human rights as an essential consequence of the Christian understanding of men. He clearly establishes \"that every man has the right to life, to bodily integrity, and to the means which are suitable for the proper development of life.\"\n\n\"Pacem in terris\" is an extended reflection on the moral order. The document is divided into four sections.\n\n“Pacem in Terris was more than an encyclical—it was an event,\" recalls Glendon.\n\"Pacem in Terris\" was the first papal encyclical published in its entirety in the \"New York Times\". The \"Washington Post\" said, \"\"Pacem in terris\" is not just the voice of an old priest, nor just that of an ancient Church; it is the voice of the conscience of the world.\" According to the periodical \"Catholic World Report\", \"Two years later, it was the subject of a conference at the United Nations attended by over 2,000 statespersons and scholars.\"\n\nF. Russell Hittinger describes the encyclical \"as a kind of magna carta of the Catholic Church's position on human rights and natural law\". Pope John XXIII's 1963 encyclical \"Pacem in terris\" (\"Peace on Earth\") radically affected Catholic social teaching not only on war and peace, but on church-state relations, women's rights, religious freedom, international relations and other major issues. Fr. J. Bryan Hehir called \"Pacem in terris\" \"a pivotal text in [papal] encyclical history\" that played a major role in the development of the Second Vatican Council's Declaration on Religious Freedom and its Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World, and on Pope John Paul II's encyclical \"Centesimus annus\" (\"The Hundredth Year\"), which marked the centennial of Pope Leo XIII's 1891 encyclical on labor, \"Rerum Novarum\". It also influenced the 1965 \"Declaration on Religious Freedom\" (\"Dignitatis humanae\").\n\nIn commemoration of this encyclical, the annual \"Pacem in Terris Peace and Freedom award\" was instituted in 1964, first by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Davenport and later by the Quad Cities Pacem in Terris Coalition.\n\nDuring an event held on May 6, 2019, in Bulgaria, where John XXIII gained a reputation for protecting Jews when serving as the country's Vatican representative, Pope Francis invoked the encyclical as a \"code of conduct\" for peace between Catholics and other religions.\n\n\n"}

Montmédy soon became the capital of his territory – later it belonged to Luxembourg, Burgundy, Austria and Spain. The original castle was replaced with a fortress by Charles V in the 16th Century.\n\nAfter Marville and Stenay had been occupied by the French, 30,000 soldiers, including King Louis XIV, attacked Montmédy, whilst 756 were defending it in 1657. They held it for 57 days and surrendered only after the death of the governor Jean V of Allamont. The military engineer Vauban advanced the outer fortifications, the moats and the walls after the siege of 1657.\n\nDuring the French Revolution in 1791, the fortress was the anticipated destination of King Louis XVI and his family in their unsuccessful attempt to escape from the growing radical republicanism of Paris. The area at that time was overwhelmingly pro-monarchy. The royal party never arrived, however, because they were discovered en route at Varennes and escorted back to the capital city. The King had hoped to establish a counter-revolutionary military base of operations in the citadel from which he could reclaim the country. The citadel has also been used as a fortress during both World Wars.\n\nBuildings, including a church dating back to the 17th century, can be found inside the citadel itself; it still is used as a place to live.

{"id": "1919367", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1919367", "title": "QCD matter", "text": "QCD matter\n\nQuark matter or QCD matter (quantum chromodynamic) refers to any of a number of phases of matter whose degrees of freedom include quarks and gluons. These phases occur at extremely high temperatures and/or densities, and some of them are still only theoretical as they require conditions so extreme that they can not be produced in any laboratory, especially not at equilibrium conditions. Under these extreme conditions, the familiar structure of matter, where the basic constituents are nuclei (consisting of nucleons which are bound states of quarks) and electrons, is disrupted. In quark matter it is more appropriate to treat the quarks themselves as the basic degrees of freedom.\n\nIn the standard model of particle physics, the strong force is described by the theory of QCD. At ordinary temperatures or densities this force just confines the quarks into composite particles (hadrons) of size around 10 m = 1 femtometer = 1 fm (corresponding to the QCD energy scale Λ ≈ 200 MeV) and its effects are not noticeable at longer distances. However, when the temperature reaches the QCD energy scale (T of order 10 kelvins) or the density rises to the point where the average inter-quark separation is less than 1 fm (quark chemical potential μ around 400 MeV), the hadrons are melted into their constituent quarks, and the strong interaction becomes the dominant feature of the physics. Such phases are called quark matter or QCD matter.\n\nThe strength of the color force makes the properties of quark matter unlike gas or plasma, instead leading to a state of matter more reminiscent of a liquid. At high densities, quark matter is a Fermi liquid, but is predicted to exhibit color superconductivity at high densities and temperatures below 10 K.\n\n\nEven though quark-gluon plasma can only occur under quite extreme conditions of temperature and/or pressure, it is being actively studied at particle colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider LHC at CERN and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider RHIC at Brookhaven National Laboratory. In these collisions, the plasma only occurs for a very short time before it spontaneously disintegrates. The plasma's physical characteristics are studied by detecting the debris emanating from the collision region with large particle detectors \n\nHeavy-ion collisions at very high energies can produce small short-lived regions of space whose energy density is comparable to that of the 20-micro-second-old universe. This has been achieved by colliding heavy nuclei such as lead nuclei at high speeds, and a first time claim of formation of quark–gluon plasma came from the SPS accelerator at CERN in February 2000. This work has been continued at more powerful accelerators, such as RHIC in the US, and as of 2010 at the European LHC at CERN located in the border area of Switzerland and France. There is good evidence that the quark–gluon plasma has also been produced at RHIC.\n\nThe context for understanding the thermodynamics of quark matter is the standard model of particle physics, which contains six different flavors of quarks, as well as leptons like electrons and neutrinos. These interact via the strong interaction, electromagnetism, and also the weak interaction which allows one flavor of quark to turn into another. Electromagnetic interactions occur between particles that carry electrical charge; strong interactions occur between particles that carry color charge.\n\nThe correct thermodynamic treatment of quark matter depends on the physical context. For large quantities that exist for long periods of time (the \"thermodynamic limit\"), we must take into account the fact that the only conserved charges in the standard model are quark number (equivalent to baryon number), electric charge, the eight color charges, and lepton number. Each of these can have an associated chemical potential. However, large volumes of matter must be electrically and color-neutral, which determines the electric and color charge chemical potentials. This leaves a three-dimensional phase space, parameterized by quark chemical potential, lepton chemical potential, and temperature.\n\nIn compact stars quark matter would occupy cubic kilometers and exist for millions of years, so the thermodynamic limit is appropriate. However, the neutrinos escape, violating lepton number, so the phase space for quark matter in compact stars only has two dimensions, temperature (\"T\") and quark number chemical potential μ. A strangelet is not in the thermodynamic limit of large volume, so it is like an exotic nucleus: it may carry electric charge.\n\nA heavy-ion collision is in neither the thermodynamic limit of large volumes nor long times. Putting aside questions of whether it is sufficiently equilibrated for thermodynamics to be applicable, there is certainly not enough time for weak interactions to occur, so flavor is conserved, and there are independent chemical potentials for all six quark flavors. The initial conditions (the impact parameter of the collision, the number of up and down quarks in the colliding nuclei, and the fact that they contain no quarks of other flavors) determine the chemical potentials. (Reference for this section:,).\n\nThe phase diagram of quark matter is not well known, either experimentally or theoretically. A commonly conjectured form of the\nphase diagram is shown in the figure to the right. It is applicable to matter in a compact star, where the only relevant thermodynamic potentials are quark chemical potential μ and temperature T. For guidance it also shows the typical values of μ and \"T\" in heavy-ion collisions and in the early universe. For readers who are not familiar with the concept of a chemical potential, it is helpful to think of μ as a measure of the imbalance between quarks and antiquarks in the system. Higher μ means a stronger bias favoring quarks over antiquarks. At low temperatures there are no antiquarks, and then higher μ generally means a higher density of quarks.\n\nOrdinary atomic matter as we know it is really a mixed phase, droplets of nuclear matter (nuclei) surrounded by vacuum, which exists at the low-temperature phase boundary between vacuum and nuclear matter, at μ = 310 MeV and \"T\" close to zero. If we increase the quark density (i.e. increase μ) keeping the temperature low, we move into a phase of more and more compressed nuclear matter. Following this path corresponds to burrowing more and more deeply into a neutron star. Eventually, at an unknown critical value of μ, there is a transition to quark matter. At ultra-high densities we expect to find the color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase of color-superconducting quark matter. At intermediate densities we expect some other phases (labelled \"non-CFL quark liquid\" in the figure) whose nature is presently unknown. They might be other forms of color-superconducting quark matter, or something different.\n\nNow, imagine starting at the bottom left corner of the phase diagram, in the vacuum where μ = \"T\" = 0. If we heat up the system without introducing any preference for quarks over antiquarks, this corresponds to moving vertically upwards along the \"T\" axis. At first, quarks are still confined and we create a gas of hadrons (pions, mostly). Then around \"T\" = 150 MeV there is a crossover to the quark gluon plasma: thermal fluctuations break up the pions, and we find a gas of quarks, antiquarks, and gluons, as well as lighter particles such as photons, electrons, positrons, etc. Following this path corresponds to travelling far back in time (so to say), to the state of the universe shortly after the big bang (where there was a very tiny preference for quarks over antiquarks).\n\nThe line that rises up from the nuclear/quark matter transition and then bends back towards the \"T\" axis, with its end marked by a star, is the conjectured boundary between confined and unconfined phases. Until recently it was also believed to be a boundary between phases where chiral symmetry is broken (low temperature and density) and phases where it is unbroken (high temperature and density). It is now known that the CFL phase exhibits chiral symmetry breaking, and other quark matter phases may also break chiral symmetry, so it is not clear whether this is really a chiral transition line. The line ends at the \"chiral critical point\", marked by a star in this figure, which is a special temperature and density at which striking physical phenomena, analogous to critical opalescence, are expected. (Reference for this section:,).\n\nFor a complete description of phase diagram it is required that one must have complete understanding of dense, strongly interacting hadronic matter and strongly interacting quark matter from some underlying theory e.g. quantum chromodynamics (QCD). However, because such a description requires the proper understanding of QCD in its non-perturbative regime, which is still far from being completely understood, any theoretical advance remains very challenging.\n\nThe phase structure of quark matter remains mostly conjectural because it is difficult to perform calculations predicting the properties of quark matter. The reason is that QCD, the theory describing the dominant interaction between quarks, is strongly coupled at the densities and temperatures of greatest physical interest, and hence it is very hard to obtain any predictions from it. Here are brief descriptions of some of the standard approaches.\n\nThe only first-principles calculational tool currently available is lattice QCD, i.e. brute-force computer calculations. Because of a technical obstacle known as the fermion sign problem, this method can only be used at low density and high temperature (μ < \"T\"), and it predicts that the crossover to the quark–gluon plasma will occur around \"T\" = 150 MeV However, it cannot be used to investigate the interesting color-superconducting phase structure at high density and low temperature.\n\nBecause QCD is asymptotically free it becomes weakly coupled at unrealistically high densities, and diagrammatic\nmethods can be used. Such methods show that the CFL phase occurs at very high density. At high temperatures, however, diagrammatic methods are still not under full control.\n\nTo obtain a rough idea of what phases might occur, one can use a model that has some of the same properties as QCD, but is easier to manipulate. Many physicists use Nambu-Jona-Lasinio models, which contain no gluons, and replace the strong interaction with a four-fermion interaction. Mean-field methods are commonly used to analyse the phases. Another approach is the bag model, in which the effects of confinement are simulated by an additive energy density that penalizes unconfined quark matter.\n\nMany physicists simply give up on a microscopic approach, and make informed guesses of the expected phases (perhaps based on NJL model results). For each phase, they then write down an effective theory for the low-energy excitations, in terms of a small number of parameters, and use it to make predictions that could allow those parameters to be fixed by experimental observations.\n\nThere are other methods that are sometimes used to shed light on QCD, but for various reasons have not yet yielded useful results in studying quark matter.\n\nTreat the number of colors \"N\", which is actually 3, as a large number, and expand in powers of 1/\"N\". It turns out that at high density the higher-order corrections are large, and the expansion gives misleading results.\n\nAdding scalar quarks (squarks) and fermionic gluons (gluinos) to the theory makes it more tractable, but the thermodynamics of quark matter depends crucially on the fact that only fermions can carry quark number, and on the number of degrees of freedom in general.\n\nExperimentally, it is hard to map the phase diagram of quark matter because it has been rather difficult to learn how to tune to high enough temperatures and density in the laboratory experiment using collisions of relativistic heavy ions as experimental tools. However, these collisions ultimately will provide information about the crossover from hadronic matter to QGP. It has been suggested that the observations of compact stars may also constrain the information about the high-density low-temperature region. Models of the cooling, spin-down, and precession of these stars offer information about the relevant properties of their interior. As observations become more precise, physicists hope to learn more.\n\nOne of the natural subjects for future research is the search for the exact location of the chiral critical point. Some ambitious lattice QCD calculations may have found evidence for it, and future calculations will clarify the situation. Heavy-ion collisions might be able to measure its position experimentally, but this will require scanning across a range of values of μ and T.\n\n\n\n"}

It represents the historic county of Hampshire. Hampshire teams formed by earlier organisations, principally the Hambledon Club, always had first-class status and the same applied to the county club when it was founded in 1863. Because of poor performances for several seasons until 1885, Hampshire then lost its status for nine seasons until it was invited into the County Championship in 1895, since when the team have played in every top-level domestic cricket competition in England. Hampshire originally played at the Antelope Ground, Southampton until 1885 when they relocated to the County Ground, Southampton until 2000, before moving to the purpose-built Rose Bowl in West End, which is in the Borough of Eastleigh. The club has twice won the County Championship, in the 1961 and 1973 seasons.\n\nHampshire played their first one-day match in the 1963 Gillette Cup, but did not win their first one-day silverware until 1975 when they won the Sunday League which it won twice more, in 1978 and 1986. It has twice won the Benson & Hedges Cup, in 1988 and 1991; the Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy once in 2005 and the Friends Provident Trophy once in 2009. Having first played Twenty20 cricket in 2003, Hampshire won the Friends Provident t20 in 2010. The County Championship was restructured in 2000, and at the end of the 2002 Hampshire was relegated for the first time. The club remained in the second division for three seasons and since 2004 had competed in the top tier. However, the club was relegated once more in 2011. The club won both the Friends Life t20 and ECB 40 in 2012, but it wasn't until 2014 before they were promoted to the first division again. They narrowly avoided relegation in 2015 before being relegated again in 2016, only to be reprieved after Durham were relegated after taking ECB sanctions to secure their future.\n\nPhil Mead is the club's leading run-scorer with 48,892 runs in 700 matches for Hampshire between 1905 and 1936. Fast bowler Derek Shackleton took 2,669 wickets in 583 first-class matches between 1948 and 1969 which remains a club record. Alec Kennedy, whose career lasted from 1907 to 1936, was the first player to score 10,000 runs and take 1,000 wickets for Hampshire. Colin Ingleby-Mackenzie was both Hampshire last amateur captain and first professional captain.\n\n\nA poem written in Latin by Robert Matthew in 1647 contains a probable reference to cricket being played by pupils of Winchester College on nearby St. Catherine’s Hill. If authentic, this is the earliest known mention of cricket in Hampshire. But, with the sport having originated in Saxon or Norman times on the Weald, it is likely to have reached what is now modern Hampshire long before 1647. In 1680, lines written in an old Bible invite \"All you that do delight in Cricket, come to Marden, pitch your wickets\". Marden is in Sussex, north of Chichester, and close to Hambledon, which is just across the county boundary in Hampshire. Hampshire is used in a team name for the first time in August 1729, when a combined Hampshire, Surrey and Sussex XI played against Kent.\n\nThe origin of the legendary Hambledon Club is lost. There remains no definite knowledge of Hambledon cricket before 1756, when its team had gained sufficient repute to be capable of attempting three matches against Dartford, itself a famous club since the 1720s if not earlier. Hambledon had presumably earned recognition as the best parish team in Hampshire, but no reports of their local matches have been found. We do not know when the Hambledon Club was founded and it seems likely that some kind of parish organisation was operating in 1756, although there may well have been a patron involved. The Sussex v Hampshire match in June 1766 is the earliest reference to Hampshire as an individual county team. Whether the Hambledon Club was involved is unrecorded but presumably it was. Some historians believe it was at about this time that the club, as distinct from a parish organisation, was founded. The Hambledon Club was in many respects a Hampshire county club for it organised Hampshire matches, although it was a multi-functional club and not dedicated to cricket alone. Its membership attracted large numbers of sporting gentry and it dominated the sport, both on and off the field, for about thirty years until the formation of Marylebone Cricket Club in 1787. Hambledon produced some legendary Hampshire players including master batsman John Small and the two great fast bowlers Thomas Brett and David Harris. Following the demise of the Hambledon Club towards the end of the 18th century, Hampshire continued to be recognised as a first-class team into the nineteenth century but, after the 1828 season, they had long spells without any first-class matches until the county club was founded in 1864. The county played some first-class fixtures during 1842 to 1845 and one match versus MCC in 1861 but was otherwise outside cricket’s mainstream through 1829 to 1863.\n\nHampshire County Cricket Club was founded on 12 August 1863 and played its first first-class match against Sussex at the Antelope Ground, Southampton on 7 and 8 July 1864. Sussex won by 10 wickets with James Lillywhite claiming ten wickets in the match for 80 runs, including his 100th career wicket. Hampshire was recognised as a first-class team from 1864 to 1885. In 1886, Hampshire lost its status after years of difficult circumstances and poor results. The team did play against Surrey and Sussex in 1886 but the matches were considered minor standard. Hampshire recovered first-class status from the beginning of the 1895 County Championship season when the team was invited to join the now official County Championship. They finished the season in tenth place, sixteen points behind winners Surrey.\n\nBetween 1900 and 1905, Hampshire were almost continuously struggling as their key officer-batsmen, Major Poore and Captain Wynyard were faced with either moving to South Africa or increased military duties at home from the Boer War. The club finished last or equal last in 1900, 1902, 1903, 1904 and 1905, failing to win a single game in the first of those seasons; however in 1901, with the temporary acquisition of Captain Greig from India and the qualification of Charlie Llewellyn, Hampshire won as many games as it lost. From 1906 onwards, with the qualification of Phil Mead, Jack Newman and later George Brown, Hampshire became a much more competitive side, though not until 1910 did they win as many games as they lost in a season.\n\nThe period from 1912 to 1926, though they never got near County Championship honours, was to be the most successful for a long time in Hampshire’s history: in those eleven seasons they won 98 and lost 96 of 292 games – only once otherwise until 1954 did they win more games than they lost. Mead, Brown, Kennedy and Newman were in the prime during this period, and they had the services of Lord Tennyson who captained the side from 1919–1932 as well as captaining the England team in three Tests, and the occasional aid of many other amateurs including the great C. B. Fry, who averaged an amazing 102 in seven games during 1912. In 1922, Hampshire won one of the most remarkable victories in County Championship history when, they defeated Warwickshire by 155 runs after having followed on when dismissed for just 15. They scored 521 after being invited to bat again, set Warwickshire 314 to win and bowled them out for 158. Brown, with 172, and Livsey who scored 110* at number 10, were the heroes.\n\nFrom 1927, Hampshire declined severely as their stalwart professionals declined and the level of amateur support fell off alarmingly. Only in 1932 and 1948 did they finish above tenth until 1955. With Stuart Boyes and Lofty Herman not fully adequate replacements as bowling mainstays for Kennedy and Newman, the bowling was never strong, and the batting generally uncertain especially when Mead declined from 1929 onwards. In 1937 Dick Moore set the individual scoring record for Hampshire against Warwickshire at Dean Park Cricket Ground in Bournemouth. His 316 took just 380 minutes and contained 43 fours and three sixes. After World War II, Derek Shackleton became an outstanding bowling mainstay well backed up by Victor Cannings, but not until 1955 did these two have enough support to rise the fortunes of the club. In 1955 Hampshire finished as high as third with Shackleton taking 160 wickets and Cannings and Peter Sainsbury around 100, with Roy Marshall was one of the few exciting batsmen of the time.\n\nThe following years were mixed: a rise to second in 1958 with Malcolm Heath replacing Cannings as Shackleton’s partner was followed by two disappointing years before Hampshire won the 1961 County Championship, their first ever County Championship success, finishing the season with 268 points, 18 ahead of Yorkshire. Hampshire won 19 of their 32 matches, losing only seven matches all season. The club were led by Colin Ingleby-Mackenzie with Marshall scoring the most runs for the club with 2,455. Derek Shackleton took the most wickets for the club with 153, and Butch White’s tearaway speed was equally dangerous in a dry summer.\n\nAgain, however, Hampshire were disappointing until Barry Richards joined the county in 1968, when they rose from tenth to fifth in the Championship and established themselves as a power in limited-overs cricket. Bob Cottam was the second-highest first-class wicket-taker in 1968 and the highest in 1969, but did not maintain this excellence before joining Northamptonshire and in 1970 and 1971 Hampshire fell to mid-table. In the 1973 County Championship Hampshire won the County Championship for a second time, winning the competition by 31 points from Surrey. The club won 10 of their 20 matches and drew the other 10. During this season they were led by Richard Gilliat with Gordon Greenidge scoring the most runs for the club with 1,620. Bob Herman and Mike Taylor both took 63 wickets. This remains Hampshire's last success in the tournament. In 1979 West Indian Malcolm Marshall, widely regarded as one of the best bowlers to grace the game joined the club. This was to be the start of a 14-year stay with the club. During that time Marshall would go on to take 824 first-class wickets at an average of 18.64 and 239 wickets at 24.88 in one-day cricket. 1984 also saw the last game of Venezuelan captain Nick Pocock (Maracaibo, 1951) and the arrival of another West Indian, Cardigan Connor who would spend 14 years with the club. Regarded as one of the best players not to play Test cricket, Connor took 614 first-class wickets for Hampshire at an average of 31.74 and 411 wickets at 25.07 in one-day cricket. In 1985 Hampshire finished second in the County Championship, finishing 18 points behind winners Middlesex. Chris Smith led the way with the bat, scoring 1,720 runs. and was well backed up by the bowling of Malcolm Marshall who took 95 wickets at the impressive average of 17.68. Later in, 1988 the club won the Benson & Hedges Cup by beating Derbyshire by 7 wickets at Lord's, largely thanks to a five wicket haul by Stephen Jefferies. The 1990s brought about further success in the first half of the decade, and later struggles in the latter half. In the 1991 County Championship season Hampshire won the NatWest Trophy, defeating Surrey by 4 wickets, with Shaun Udal claiming the man of the match award. This was the clubs first one day honour in this competition. Hampshire again repeated their 1988 success in the Benson & Hedges Cup by winning the 1992 competition. In the final at Lord's they beat Kent by 41 runs, including 90 runs from Robin Smith and three wickets each from Malcolm Marshall and Shaun Udal. This marked Hampshire's second success in the competition. In 1996 Malcolm Marshall returned to coach the club. In 1997 work begun on Hampshire's long-awaited new ground. The realisation of this move almost led the club to financial ruin, as encouragement from financial partners Sport England and the hiring of architect Sir Michael Hopkins had led the then part-time voluntary committee running the club to lose control of the budget.\n\nIn 2000 Australian great Shane Warne was signed as the club's overseas player. The 2000 County Championship was to be the last season that Hampshire would play at the County Ground Southampton before they moved in 2001 to the new Rose Bowl ground just outside Southampton. 2001 also saw current club chairman take over the running of the club, after a period of financial difficulty. In the 2002 County Championship Hampshire were relegated back to Division Two, finishing third bottom in Division One. It was during this season that the club signed former England batsman John Crawley from Lancashire. In the 2003 season Hampshire and England great Robin Smith retired from all forms of cricket after 23 years with the club. In 2005, Hampshire performed well in both first-class and one-day forms of the game. The side narrowly missed out on winning the County Championship Division 1 by just 2.5 points to Nottinghamshire. In the 2005 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy Hampshire progressed to the final thanks to a century in the semi-final against Yorkshire by Sean Ervine. In the final at Lord's against Warwickshire Ervine repeated the feat scoring 104 runs as Hampshire won by 18 runs; Hampshire's first silverware in 13 years. Two years later, Hampshire progressed to the final of the newly renamed 2007 Friends Provident Trophy at Lord's after finishing top of the South Division. In the final the club played Durham where they lost by 125 runs as the match went into a reserve day due to rain. In 2007 Hampshire chairman Rod Bransgrove announced plans for the redevelopment of the Rose Bowl to bring Test cricket to the ground. Prior to the 2008 County Championship season Australian legend and club captain Shane Warne reiterated his commitment to the club. But shortly before the start of the season Warne announced his retirement from first-class cricket. Former captain Shaun Udal also announced his retirement, having played for Hampshire since 1989, though he later joined Middlesex. Dimitri Mascarenhas was named Warne's replacement as captain for the 2008 season. In 2008, Hampshire struggled and were near the foot of the Division 1 table for the majority of the season. Midway through the season coach Paul Terry stood down and was replaced by Giles White. A series of strong performances helped Hampshire go from relegation favourites to title outsiders going into the final round of matches. The club ended up finishing in third place, twelve points behind winners Durham. On 25 July the club won the 2009 Friends Provident Trophy final at Lord's, beating rivals Sussex thanks to a man-of-the-match performance from Dominic Cork, with him taking 4/41. Hampshire created history by winning the 2010 Friends Provident t20 in front of home support after defeating Somerset – the first team to win a Twenty20 trophy on home turf in England and Wales. On 14 September 2011, in their four-day game against Warwickshire at The Rose Bowl, Hampshire were officially relegated to the County Championship Second Division. The 2012 season though, under new captain Jimmy Adams after the retirement of Cork, would prove to be highly successful for Hampshire with the county winning both the 2012 Friends Life t20 – their 2nd Twenty20 title, and the 2012 Clydesdale Bank 40 where a final ball dot ball from Kabir Ali led to Hampshire winning as a result of losing less wickets than opponents Warwickshire. Club legend Dimitri Mascarenhas played in both finals but retired at the end of the 2013 season.\n\nHowever, despite constant success in limited overs cricket the county continued to struggle in First class cricket leading to coach Giles White moving into a Director of Cricket position and Dale Benkenstein being appointed the new coach at the beginning of 2014. He brought instant success as Hampshire won promotion as champions to the County Championship First Division with victory over Glamorgan on 23 September 2014. The 2015 season was reasonable successful with Hampshire qualifying for a record 6th successive Twenty20 Finals Day, however their First class performances at the beginning of the season were poor leading to Adams' resignation as captain. James Vince took over as captain, having already become List A and T20 captain previously, and led a revival as Hampshire won four of their last five games, meaning that Hampshire completed the 'Great Escape' as victory over Nottinghamshire in their final games thanks to 10 wickets from West Indian Fidel Edwards, and Yorkshire's victory over Sussex meant that Sussex and Worcestershire were relegated to Division Two with Hampshire staying up.\n\nIn the winter of 2015 Hampshire completed the signing of England seamer Reece Topley from Essex. The club also announced that Fidel Edwards had signed a new deal and South African all rounder Ryan McLaren had signed as an overseas player. On 14 January 2016, Hampshire Cricket was announced as one of six new teams in the inaugural Women's Cricket Super League. Hampshire, in partnership with Berkshire, Dorset, Isle of Wight, Oxfordshire, Sussex and Wiltshire cricket boards along with Southampton Solent University, will compete in a women's Twenty20 competition against the other team. On 28 January 2016 Hampshire appointed former Wiltshire coach Nick Denning as their inaugural coach for their Women's team. Following the appointment of Denning, Hampshire announced the naming of their Women's Cricket Super League team as the Southern Vipers. The Vipers then won the inaugural Kia Super League on 21 August, defeating Western Force in the final by 7 wickets. Overseas star Suzie Bates was named as player of the tournament. For the male team though it was a season of disappointment. A large number of injuries at the start of the season, including to fast bowlers Reece Topley, Fidel Edwards, Chris Wood and Ryan Stevenson, coupled with poor form and tough circumstances, after the death of trialist fast bowler Hamza Ali in a drowning accident, and long serving opening batsman Michael Carberry being diagnosed with a cancerous lung tumour, saw Hampshire suffer a poor season, being knocked out in the group stages of both the Natwest t20 Blast, where they missed out on Finals Day for the first time since 2009, and the Royal London One-Day Cup. Their championship season was much the same as in 2015, again making a slow start, but they gave themselves too much to do and were relegated back to Division Two after defeat against Durham on 23 September 2016. However, on 3 October 2016 Hampshire were given a reprieve as Durham were relegated to Division Two after taking up a financial package from the ECB to help with their finances, with their relegation and a points deduction being the fine for taking this agreement. Coach Dale Benkenstein departed as coach for 'Personal Reasons' in mid-July and was replaced by Craig White originally in a caretaker role, before taking over as full-time first team coach in November. At the end of the season, long serving seamer James Tomlinson retired having been with Hampshire since 2002 and making over 150 appearances in all formats for Hampshire. The Winter of 2017 saw Hampshire draw criticism over the signings of Kyle Abbott and Rilee Rossouw on Kolpak deals, with these players giving up international cricket to represent Hampshire. On the field Hampshire again had a mixed season in first class cricket, avoiding relegation for the 3rd season in a row by drawing against already relegated Warwickshire meaning relegation for Middlesex, with Kolpak Abbott taking 60 wickets across the First-class season. In List A cricket Hampshire again missed out on the knockout stages. However Hampshire performed better in Twenty20 cricket, qualifying for their 7th Finals Day in 8 years, although they lost in the Semi-final to eventual winners Nottinghamshire. They also recorded their highest Twenty20 score in their Quarter final victory over Derbyshire scoring 249-8, with Pakistan overseas player Shahid Afridi scoring a century.\n\n2018 saw improved performances in first-class cricket as Hampshire secured their Division One status before the final day for the first time since promotion in 2014. Kolpak stars Kyle Abbott and Fidel Edwards both taking more than 50 wickets in the season but it was in List A cricket where Hampshire were most successful, winning the 2018 Royal London One-Day Cup, with a century in the final at Lord's by Rilee Rossouw. Hampshire though performed poorly in Twenty20 cricket finishing 2nd bottom of the South group. Overseas player Mujeeb Ur Rahman though became the first Afghan to play for Hampshire, and the first player to be born in the 21st century to play for Hampshire. Long time players Jimmy Adams and Sean Ervine though retired at the end of the 2018 season having amassed more than 35,000 runs in all formats between them for Hampshire, while coach Craig White also departed after two seasons as head coach, and was replaced by South African Adrian Birrell in December.\n\n2019 again saw strong performance in first-class cricket as Hampshire finished 3rd in the County Championship, their highest finish in over 10 years. Kyle Abbott once again was leading wicket taker, while also taking the best Hampshire bowling figures in a match when he took 17/86 against Somerset in September. Ajinkya Rahane also became the first Indian player to represent Hampshire during an overseas spell in June. Hampshire once again also made the 2019 Royal London One-Day Cup final, however this year they were defeated in the final by Somerset. There was though success for Hampshire academy graduates James Vince and Liam Dawson as they were part of England's victorious World Cup winning side. Hampshire, though, again failed to progress from the group in T20 cricket.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For more details on this topic, see List of Hampshire CCC first-class cricket records, List of Hampshire CCC List A cricket records, List of Hampshire CCC Twenty20 cricket records.\"\n\n\"For more details on this topic, see Hampshire County Cricket Club record by opponent.\"\n\nHampshire play the majority of their home matches at The Rose Bowl. One reason for building the new Rose Bowl ground was to attract international cricket to the south coast of England. The old County Ground, Hampshire's home since 1885, no longer had the capability to do this. Land in West End, on the outskirts of Southampton was chosen as the location for The Rose Bowl. Construction began in March 1997 and was completed in time for the 2001 season. Hampshire's first first-class match on the ground was against Worcestershire, ending in a victory by 124 runs for Hampshire. In July 2008 the ground hosted the Twenty20 Cup final, with Middlesex defeating Kent by 3 runs in the final. In August 2010, the ground hosted the Friends Provident t20 finals day, in which history was created when Hampshire became the first team to win the tournament at their home ground as they defeated Somerset in dramatic scenes off the last ball of the match. In 2011, England played their first Test cricket|Test match at the Rose Bowl during their series with Sri Lanka.\n\nThe ends are called the \"Pavilion End\" and the \"Northern End\".\n\n\n\n"}

The original Broadway production played in 1961–62.\n\nThe musical was inspired by an article about subway homelessness in the March 1956 issue of \"Harper's\" magazine and a subsequent 1957 book based on it, both by Edmund G. Love, who slept on subway trains throughout the 1950s and encountered many unique individuals. With the profits from his book, Love then embarked on a bizarre hobby: over the course of several years, he ate dinner at every restaurant listed in the Manhattan yellow pages directory, visiting them in alphabetical order. A previous adaptation of the \"Harper's\" article was aired August 3, 1956 on \"CBS Radio Workshop\".\n\nAngie McKay is a magazine writer assigned to write a story about a group of well-dressed homeless people sleeping in the New York subway system. Their leader is Tom Bailey, a one-man employment agency who finds other drifters odd jobs and sleeping quarters. To help research her story, Angie goes undercover and pretends to be a stranded girl from out-of-town. Trouble ensues when Tom discovers her real identity.\n\nAfter two previews, the Broadway production, directed and choreographed by Michael Kidd, opened on December 27, 1961 at the St. James Theatre, where it ran for 205 performances. The cast included Orson Bean, Sydney Chaplin, Carol Lawrence, Gordon Connell, Grayson Hall, and Green's wife Phyllis Newman (whose costume, consisting solely of a towel, was probably Freddy Wittop's easiest design in his distinguished career), with newcomers Michael Bennett and Valerie Harper in the chorus.\n\n\"Subways Are for Sleeping\" opened to mostly negative reviews. The show already was hampered by a lack of publicity, since the New York City Transit Authority refused to post advertisements on the city's buses and in subway trains and stations for fear they would be perceived as officially sanctioning the right of vagrants to use these facilities as overnight accommodations. Producer David Merrick and press agent Harvey Sabinson decided to invite individuals with the same names as prominent theatre critics (such as Walter Kerr, Richard Watts, Jr. and Howard Taubman) to see the show, and afterwards used their favorable comments in print ads. Thanks to photographs of the seven \"critics\" accompanying their blurbs (the well-known real Richard Watts was not African American), the ad was discovered to be a deception. It was pulled from most newspapers, but not before running in an early edition of the \"New York Herald Tribune\". However, the clever publicity stunt allowed the musical to continue to run and it eventually turned a small profit.\n\nNewman won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical, and nominations went to Bean for Best Featured Actor and Kidd's choreography.\n\nAn original cast recording was released by Columbia Records. A revival production was briefly mounted in 2009.\n\n\n\n"}

The VN700A has a shaft drive. Kawasaki also made the now rare VZ 750 variant with chromed wheel arches and other subtle differences. To avoid United States tariffs on Japanese motorcycles over 700cc, the initial US model was limited to 699 cc but in 1986, the tariff was lifted so the engine capacity was increased to 749 cc. Apart from paint schemes the Vulcan remained largely unchanged throughout its 22-year production run with only minor adjustments to components.\n\nKawasaki introduced the Vulcan 400 in 1986 as an entry level cruiser. For a first series, The Vulcan 400 featured a 398 cc liquid-cooled twin engine, and was fitted with a belt drive and six-speed transmission. The series 2 Vulcan 400 featured a 399 cc liquid-cooled V-twin engine similar in design to the 750. The series 2 was fitted with a chain drive and five-speed transmission to reduce cost and was produced in both \"Classic\" and \"Drifter\" variations.\n\nThe Vulcan 500 (EN500A) introduced in 1990 was the successor to the Kawasaki 454 LTD. The EN500A was fitted with a parallel twin 498 cc engine nearly identical to the Kawasaki Ninja 500R. It had a 6 speed transmission and belt final drive. The EN500A was discontinued after 1996 and replaced with the Vulcan 500 LTD (EN500C). Both versions were available as 1996 models. With the EN500C the ergonomics changed as well as the engine tuning. New cam shaft profiles and slightly lower compression pistons moved the power band down to increase low end torque. Also the carburetors were downsized from 34mm to 32mm. The belt final drive was replaced with a chain. The Vulcan 500 LTD was discontinued after the 2009 model year for a nearly 20 year production run.\n\nThe Vulcan 650 S (EN650AF/BF) is designated as a Sport cruiser. Introduced in 2015 with an Ergo-Fit system designed for better custom comfort adjustability for different rider sizes. A choice of three foot peg positions, three seats and three handlebars are available to choose from, at time of purchase. The engine is a 649cc parallel twin derived from the Ninja 650. Retuned, heavier flywheel and redesigned intake give the Vulcan S more low and mid range torque. It has very non traditional cruiser looks with a unique frame and suspension layout. \n\nAll Specs via \n\nThe Vulcan 1500 Classic has a liquid-cooled SOHC 50° V-twin engine with a single-pin crankshaft. It has a seat height, wide handlebar, forward-mounted floorboards. \n\nThe Vulcan 1500 Drifter ceased production in 2005.\nThe Vulcan 88, with its 1464 cc liquid-cooled V-twin design was produced from 1987 through 1999. A four speed transmission was blended with the, \"large for its time motor\" and offered consumers a big-bore metric cruiser that was comfortable and relatively light-weight at just over 600 lbs when \"rider ready\".\n\nThe 1500 Meanstreak was introduced in 2002 and lasted 2 years, before giving way to the 1600 Meanstreak. This performance version of the 1500 had the same basic engine as the 1500FI, but sported several upgrades including new camshafts, larger valves, larger fuel injection throttle bodies, new high compression pistons, and re-designed combustion chamber. It also had a slimmed down narrower gas tank. This meant an increase to 72hp at 5500rpm and 90ft/lbs at 3000rpm, while weighing in at a mere 637 lbs dry.\n\nTwo models of the Vulcan were discontinued in 2006 with the introduction of the VN900. These were the VN800A introduced in 1995 and the first of Kawasaki's modern cruiser style. The VN800A featured a softail design, bobbed rear fender and a 21-inch front wheel. The second, the VN800B (Classic) was introduced in 1996 and had a retro styling that featured full fenders and 16-inch wheels on both front and rear.\n\n\nBased and built on the same frame, the Vulcan 2000 base model, Classic, and Classic LT have only subtle differences between the variations. The most apparent is the \"bug-eye\" chrome nacelle projection headlight that was first introduced on 2004 Vulcan VN2000A base model. This headlight was the only offering from Kawasaki until the introduction of the Vulcan Classic VN2000D in 2006, which employed a more traditional headlight.

The game stars Tails from the \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" series in a solo adventure, as he collects an array of items to help him explore Tails Island and defeat the enemies inhabiting it. The gameplay is more slow-paced than other \"Sonic\" games, with Tails only capable of walking and flying at a moderate speed. The stages are explored in a non-linear fashion, with newly collected items opening up pathways in previous areas.\n\nAlong with \"Tails' Skypatrol\", the game is one of two on the Game Gear to star Tails in a solo role. \"Tails Adventure\" received mixed reviews, with critics finding the game unoriginal and too slow-paced compared to previous \"Sonic\" offerings. Retrospective reviews commended the game for trying something different and compared the gameplay to the \"Metroid\" series, but disliked what they felt was repetitive backtracking. \"Tails Adventure\" was included in \"Sonic Adventure DX\" (2003), \"Sonic Gems Collection\" (2005), and re-released on the Nintendo 3DS in 2013.\n\nContrary to the classic speedy gameplay in the \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" series, \"Tails Adventure\" is a slow-paced platformer with an emphasis on exploration. The player controls Tails in a story set before he befriended Sonic, as he adventures to save Tails Island from an invasion of the Kukku Army. He cannot run, but only walk at a steady pace. The player explores twelve non-linear stages, collecting new items and abilities to open up new path ways in previous stages. A total of 26 items can be collected, including some to defeat enemies and others to aid in exploration. Along with using items, Tails can fly for a short period of time. His fly duration can be extended by locating Chaos Emeralds. Rings are collected as a form of health, and unlike other \"Sonic\" games, only a few rings are lost when touching a hazard. This gameplay has been compared to Metroidvania games.\n\nTails finds several different kinds of gadgets on his adventures. Some of these items are weapons used to defeat enemies, like bombs and hammers. Some items aid in exploration, such as a small robot which Tails can control to scout ahead and squeeze into tight spaces. Tails can only carry four tools when entering a stage. Only one item can be equipped at a time, the player must pause the game to change items. If the player finds that they cannot advance because they require another item, they must find a stage exit, swap items, and re-enter the stage from the beginning.\n\n\"Tails Adventure\" was developed for the Game Gear by Aspect and published by Sega. Along with \"Tails Skypatrol\", it is one of two \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" games on the Game Gear to star Tails. The soundtrack was composed by Koijro Mikusa, who also wrote music for \"Sonic Blast\". \"Tails Adventure\" was released for the Game Gear on September 22, 1995 in Japan. It was released in Europe in October, and in North America in November. The game was first re-released through \"Sonic Adventure DX\" in 2003 as an unlockable bonus game, and later in the \"Sonic Gems Collection\" compilation in 2005. It was also re-released on the Nintendo 3DS via the eShop worldwide in 2013 along with several other \"Sonic\" games for the Game Gear.\n\nCritics felt \"Tails Adventure\" was too similar to other platform games, and its slow pace made it weaker than other \"Sonic\" offerings. \"Famitsu\" felt it lacked any surprising elements and was disappointed it was much more standard than other \"Sonic\" games. \"Mean Machines Sega\" agreed, calling it \"decidedly unoriginal\", but believed secret areas and a steep learning curve made it interesting enough to continue playing. \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" compared the game to \"Super Mario\" platforming titles and also enjoyed finding hidden areas. Critics generally liked the graphics and controls, however the graphics did receive some criticism. \"Mean Machines Sega\" felt some of the background textures repeated too much, \"Famitsu\" criticized the screen's narrow field of vision, and \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" noted some screen blur issues.\n\nIn retrospective reviews, both \"Nintendo World Report\" and \"Nintendo Life\" felt the game was a significant contrast to the other \"Sonic\" Game Gear games. They believed the game exchanged the speed of previous series installments for exploratory gameplay more akin to the \"Metroid\" series and \"Gargoyle's Quest\" (1990). \"USgamer\" recommended the game, calling it a departure from the \"Sonic\" series, and the closest a \"Sonic\" game ever felt to a Nintendo franchise. \"Nintendo Life\" enjoyed the variety of gadgets and level designs, but criticized the dark environments and repeating background textures. Along with \"Nintendo World Report\", they criticized the game's poor handling of inventory. The journalists would often explore large portions of a level only to learn they were missing a necessary item, and would need to restart the stage. The game's presence in \"Sonic Gems Collection\" was welcomed as a modern convenience, but was criticized along with other Game Gear inclusions for graphical glitches and poor emulation. Some felt the portable games were merely supplemental to the more substantial games in the collection and dismissed them. \"1UP.com\" called \"Tails Adventure\" and \"Tails Skypatrol\" \"the bottom of the barrel [...] nigh-unplayable portable titles from an era best forgotten.\"\n"}

Sa'sa' was demolished by the Israeli Seventh Brigade and Oded Brigade on October 30, 1948. Sa'sa' surrendered without resistance and allegations of Israeli atrocities later surfaced. Many of the villagers from Sa'sa live in Nahr al-Bared, a Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon, although some resettled in nearby Jish.\n\nOn the grounds of the kibbutz is the alleged tomb of rabbi Levi ben Sisi, who is actually known to have died in far-away Babylonia during the first half of the third century.\n\nIn 1950, the American correspondent Kenneth W. Bilby started his book \"New Star in The Near East\" - depicting the 1948 war and its aftermath - with an eyewitness account of Sassa: \"Face Lifting. The Mukhtar of Sassa had fled, and his 2000 Arab villagers with him. By November 1949, 120 young American-born Jews had supplanted them, and the old village roosting on a Galilean hilltop had begun to acquire a Western flavor. The Mukhtar's home was being plastered and cemented into a communal shower. Power-driven lathes, imported from the United States, were turning out furniture for the new Jewish settlements which mushroomed in the Galilee. Prefabricated barracks with beaverboard interiors, fresh-painted American tractors, and an experimental windmill which resembled a radar antenna provided more accouterments of progress. Sassa, which had existed unchanged for over a thousand years, was on the altar - an offering, like the lambs of Abraham, for the betterment of the people of Israel\" .\nIn 1992, the Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi described the remains of Sa'sa' village: \"Some of the old olive trees remain, and a number of walls and houses still stand. Some of the houses are presently used by the kibbutz; one of them has an arched entrance and arched windows. A large portion of the surrounding land is forested, the rest is cultivated by Israeli farmers.\" The village mosque has been converted into the kibbutz museum.\n\nSasa operates Plasan, a plastics factory that manufactures vehicle armour. The company, which is shared between some 100 families, is now a world leader in armor protection technology for vehicles. The kibbutz has signed contracts worth billions of dollars with major clients, including the U.S. military.\n\nOther branches of the economy include a dairy, in cooperation with kibbutz Tuval; a beef herd; fruit trees (kiwi, apple, avocado and grapefruit); Bereshit, a fruit marketing company in cooperation with 11 other kibbutzim; and Sasa Tech, a manufacturer of technical and home care products. Buza, a chain of ice cream shops founded by a Sasa resident, runs a branch on the kibbutz and offers ice cream workshops.\n"}

He was also a generous mentor and inspiration to a great many Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal students, professionals, and political leaders.\n\nHe died of lung cancer in 2005 at the age of 60.\n\nCardinal's activism began early, as he was elected president of the Canadian Indian Youth Council in 1966. His leadership qualities began to surface in 1968 when, at age 23, he was elected leader of the Indian Association of Alberta for an unprecedented nine terms, during which he was instrumental in the formation of the National Indian Brotherhood (the forerunner of the Assembly of First Nations).\n\nCardinal then served the people of his home community, the Sucker Creek Indian Band, as their Chief.\n\nCardinal served as the Vice Chief of the Assembly of First Nations during the period of the patriation of the Canadian Constitution in the early 1980s.\n\nCardinal was instrumental in the creation, in 1984, of the Prairie Treaty Nations Alliance, representing all First Nations of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, to advance issues of concern to those First Nations with particular emphasis on their treaties with the Crown.\n\nCardinal also participated in Canadian federal politics, in 2000 running unsuccessfully as a candidate for the Liberal Party in the riding of Athabasca. He ran against David Chatters, who had been accused of being anti-Native, in explicit opposition to the apparent revival of popular and political support for policies of Aboriginal assimilation.\n\nCardinal rose to national prominence in the late 1960s. In 1968, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau proclaimed Canada to be a \"just society.\" However, after a promising round of consultations between the government of Canada and aboriginal leaders in which issues of Aboriginal and Treaty rights and the right of self-government were prominently discussed, Aboriginal people were outraged when Trudeau's Minister of Indian Affairs, the Hon. Jean Chrétien (later Prime Minister of Canada) introduced a \"White Paper\" which advocated the elimination of separate legal status for native people in Canada. The white paper amounted to an assimilation program which, if implemented, would have repealed the \"Indian Act\", transferred responsibility for Indian Affairs to the provinces and terminated the rights of Indians under the various treaties they had made with the Crown.\n\nIn 1969, Cardinal swept open what he called, in his first book \"The Unjust Society,\" (cf. Just Society) the \"buckskin curtain\" between aboriginal people and mainstream society with force that was backed up with knowledge, understanding, dignity, anger and pride. The result, as expressed in the title of his second book, published in 1977, was \"The Rebirth of Canada's Indians\" as a political force in Canada.\n\"The Unjust Society\" was Cardinal's personal response to the Trudeau White Paper. It became an immediate Canadian best-seller and was reprinted in 2000 with a new introduction by Cardinal. \"The Unjust Society\" was instrumental in causing the Canadian government to abandon the policy of the White Paper. Cardinal was also the principal author of the Indian Association of Alberta's response to the White Paper, entitled \"Citizens Plus\", also known as \"The Red Paper\". Cardinal's words galvanized the First Nations of Canada into action. The result was a complete about-face by the federal government on the policies of the White Paper and the establishment of joint meetings between First Nations and the federal cabinet in the early 1970.\n\nCardinal's gift for satire was displayed in his early writings, turning Trudeau's promise of a \"just society\" into an \"unjust society\" and a \"white paper\" into \"red paper\", and then equating the brutal slaughter of American Indians by the U.S. Cavalry with bayonet and guns with the cultural genocide which the Canadian government was perpetrating on aboriginal people with paper.\n\nCardinal's lifelong demand for radical changes in policy on aboriginal rights, education, social programs and economic development was a beacon of hope for Canada's First Nations people.\n\nIn 1969, along with Indigenous communities, Elders, and other leaders, Cardinal radically questioned the hegemony of the nation state through his efforts to stop \"The White Paper,\" which culminated in his book \"The Unjust Society\". The book was instrumental in bringing Indigenous people's voices and issues to a centre stage in Canadian life; it also critically engaged the theoretical foundation and practice of Canadian liberalism as found in then Prime Minister Trudeau's conceptualizations of a \"just society\" where all citizens would be considered \"equal\" in the context of the current nation state. Cardinal argued the state's premise of equality and justice was a false one because it failed to take into account the historical conditions under which the nation state was created: conditions that denied Indigenous people's rights as entrenched in the treaties and conditions that, subsequently, oppressed and subjugated them.\n\nCardinal was not only an architect of change on the political level, he was also instrumental in engaging and redefining the manner in which Indigenous and non-Indigenous people related to one another. One of the foundations of his life work was the insistence of the need for mutual recognition, understanding, and respect between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. While he acknowledged difference, he still fundamentally believed in the power of relationship: \"Two more disparate people, speaking in different tongues, speaking from different worlds, would be hard to find anywhere, and yet their dreams, their visions, their hopes, and their aspirations could not find any greater fusion\"(Cardinal,1977, p.-). Cardinal is also one of the first Indigenous scholars who actively sought \"…a convergence between the knowledge systems of the Cree people and other First Nations and the knowledge systems found in Western educational institutions\" (Cardinal,2007, p. 65). Upon recognition of the power of colonization over both societies, Cardinal foresaw a bridge of understanding between them.\n\nAs embedded in Cardinal's philosophical praxis, his most profound legacy was felt within Indigenous communities. He was one of the first contemporary Indigenous scholars to articulate the notion that Indigenous people could still hold onto traditions while fully engaging in modernity. Cardinal also opened the mindset of the Canadian public to the idea that Indigenous Elders were effectively \"public intellectuals,\" tacitly, raising the profile of Indigenous knowledge. He made further intellectual road maps between Indigenous scholarship and traditional knowledge by articulating the Elders' desires to see Indigenous scholars become familiar with conceptual and theoretical frameworks of Indigenous thought through Indigenous languages in order to maintain cultural strength.\n\nIn addition to his political posts, Cardinal had a full and varied career. In the 1970s, Cardinal was the first Aboriginal person to be appointed to the post of regional director general of Indian Affairs. His tenure was brief and controversial.\n\nIn 1984, Cardinal was appointed by the chiefs of Treaty 8 to negotiate an agreement to \"renovate\" that treaty. The failure of the negotiations after a promising beginning caused Cardinal to undertake a lengthy period of personal reflection, including much study with elders.\n\nCardinal also acted as a negotiator and consultant to many First Nations relating to land and other issues, usually relating to treaty rights.\n\nCardinal made a significant contribution to the work of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, as well as the work of the Assembly of First Nations, particularly on the need for recognition of the sovereignty of First Nations as expressed through their treaties with the Crown. His lifelong position has been that the spirit and intent of the treaties must be the principal instrument governing relations between First Nations and the Crown.\n\nAfter a career in First Nations politics and extensive study with First Nation elders, Cardinal undertook the formal study of law in his 40s. While studying law at the University of Saskatchewan he also served as an assistant professor at that University. He completed his LLM at Harvard University. A Doctorate in Law from the University of British Columbia was awarded to Cardinal days before his death in June, 2005.\n\nOn November 4, 2004, two months before his 60th birthday, Cardinal was admitted to the Bar of Alberta.\n\nIn 1999, Cardinal received an honorary doctor of laws from the University of Alberta in recognition of his unique achievements in leadership, public policy and law.\n\nIn 2001 Cardinal received a National Aboriginal Achievement Award, now the Indspire Awards, lifetime achievement award.\n\n\nCardinal, Harold. \"Nation-Building as Process: Reflections of a Nihiyow (Cree), in DePasquale (ed.), Natives & Settlers, 2007.\n\nCardinal, Harold.

{"id": "1919426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1919426", "title": "Mitsubishi Chariot", "text": "Mitsubishi Chariot\n\nThe Mitsubishi Chariot is a small multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) manufactured and marketed by Mitsubishi from 1983 to 2003. Based on the SSW concept car first exhibited at the 23rd Tokyo Motor Show in 1979, the MPV derives its nameplate from chariots used by the ancient Greek and Roman Empires.\n\nInternationally, the MPV has been marketed as the Mitsubishi Space Wagon, Mitsubishi Nimbus and Mitsubishi Expo — and as the Dodge and Plymouth Colt Vista Wagon, as captive imports in North America, and as the Eagle Vista Wagon in Canada. It has also been manufactured under license as the Hyundai Santamo and Mitsubishi Savrin in Asia.\n\nThe first generation Chariot (D0#W-series) was produced from February 1983 to May 1991 with a choice of SOHC straight-four powerplants ranging from the 1.6-liter \"4G32\" to the 2.0-liter \"4G63\" petrol engines, or the 1.8 liter 4D65T turbodiesel (from October 1984), mated to a five-speed manual or three-speed automatic transmission. It occupied the market segment previously served by the Mitsubishi Galant station wagon.\n\nThe Chariot's wheelbase was , while overall length ranged from depending on market and equipment level, which was within compliance with Japanese regulations concerning exterior dimensions and engine displacement size.\n\nA van version with an extended fiberglass roof was sold in Finland as the Mitsubishi Space Van. At the time vans were exempt from tax in Finland and the roof was extended to reach the minimum height of cargo space needed to be registered as a van. The fiberglass extensions were produced by boat manufacturer Esboat. The van's top speed was limited to 80 km/h.\n\nFrom June 1984, a version with permanent four-wheel drive was also offered for the two-liter engined model, while Japanese customers could also get the \"4G62\" engine in the MR Turbo version from July 1983 until the 1987 model year (1795 cc, at 5800 rpm). This version could reach , and was also available with the 3-speed automatic.\n\nIn Australia, where it was marketed as the \"Nimbus\", it won the 1984 \"Wheels\" Car of the Year award in its debut year. The Nimbus model codes were \"UA\" (1984), \"UB\" (1986), and \"UC\" (1987).\n\nA single 1.8-litre GLX version, with manual or automatic transmission, was assembled from CKD kits in New Zealand by importer Todd Motors (later Mitsubishi NZ Ltd).\n\nThe rebadged Dodge and Plymouth Colt Vista, or in Canada, the Eagle Vista Wagon (1989-1991), were introduced in August 1983 as a 1984 model and they were offered in North America until 1991. The Colt Vista was originally available only with front-wheel drive and the 2.0-liter 4G63 engine producing in US trim. Transmissions were the \"Twin-Stick\" (4x2 gears), a five-speed manual, or a three-speed automatic. In later years, power crept up to and four-wheel drive became an option. Top speed was , for the 4WD. The Dodge/Plymouth Colt/Eagle Summit wagons replaced the Vista.\n\nThe second generation (1991-1997) featured a longer wheelbase as well as greater length, width, and height, while still remaining in the Japanese Governments regulations concerning vehicle exterior dimensions and engine displacement. The G63B engine was replaced with the architecturally similar but updated 4G63 four-cylinder engine, and the turbodiesel 4G37B was phased out and replaced with a newer and larger 1,997 cc 4D68T powerplant. In 1993 a 2,350 cc 4G64 was added to the range. A five-speed manual, or four-speed automatic could be specified, and in high-end models an INVECS electronically controlled four-speed auto with \"fuzzy logic\" was also available.\n\nA limited production 4WD and turbocharged version was offered only in Japan, called the \"Resort Runner GT\", which borrowed the powertrain from the Lancer Evolution and the Galant VR-4, offering the 4G63 engine, producing with the manual transmission, and with the automatic transmission. It was a continuation of the first generation 1.8MR, also installed with a turbocharged engine from 1983 through 1987.\n\nIt continued the previous seating arrangement of three rows of seats, capable of seating seven people. The middle row can be slid forward or back to accommodate multiple seating arrangements. The second and third row have solid bench seat cushions with seat backs that are split 50:50; the second row seatbacks can be both folded down upon the seat cushions or reclined completely flat with the third row seat cushion. The second row can also be slid forward to provide access to the third row.\n\nAgain, from 1992, a single GLX model was assembled in New Zealand, with manual or automatic transmissions, at Mitsubishi's Porirua plant. Due to the partnership that existed between Chrysler Motors and Mitsubishi Motors during this time period, this generation of Chariot shares a similar appearance with the sales leader Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager, and was sold in North America as the Mitsubishi Expo. This vehicle was also sold on a shorter wheelbase, in a version marketed as the Mitsubishi RVR.\n\nIn Korea, Hyundai Precision & Ind. Co. built a rebadged version of the second generation Mitsubishi Chariot between 1996 and 2002 that was called Hyundai Santamo and Galloper Santamo. According to the corresponding article on Korean Wikipedia, the Hyundai Santamo name was an acronym, meaning \"SAfety aNd TAlented MOtor\".\n\nWhilst the vehicle was sold in many countries under a variety of names, not all markets received the full range of models. For example, Australia only received the 2.4L 4G64 front wheel drive, in Manual and Automatic.\n\nThe third and final generation was introduced on October 17, 1997, and was larger and heavier again. It was now known in its home market as the Chariot Grandis, after the French \"grandiose\", to emphasise the increase in the car's size and quality as it moved from a ladder frame to monocoque construction, using the company's \"RISE\" safety body. Mitsubishi discontinued all other straight-4 engines in favour of a single gasoline direct injection version of the \"4G64\", while introducing a new 2972 cc SOHC \"6G72\" V6 powerplant, also GDI-equipped.\nFor Europe, there were also available 2.0 4G63 SOHC 16 valve engine, which is well known on the 8th generation Galant. The INVECS-II four-speed semi-auto and 5-speed manual transmission were options. Four-wheel-drive version was only available with 2.4 GDI and 5-speed manual transmission. Rear viscous-limited-slip differential was an option. Center differential is also with viscous-coupling-unit. Gearbox and transfer box look similar to Lancer Evolution, but still are different.\nFor Japanese market, due to the engine size exceeding 2000cc, and the width exceeding 1.7 m, this generation was no longer in compliance with Japanese regulations, and buyers were now liable for additional yearly taxes, which affected sales. The 3.0 litre engine also obligated Japanese buyers to pay more annual road tax which was also a consideration affecting purchases.\n\nThis generation was not sold in North America, as the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager were now sold in regular and extended length vehicles, with the longer models sold as Grand Caravan and Grand Voyager in addition to the Chrysler Town and Country. It was marketed as a large minivan as a result.\n\nThe Chariot Grandis was finally superseded by release of the Mitsubishi Grandis on May 14, 2003, although production of the older vehicle continued until the following year for overseas markets.\n\n\"(Sources: Fact & Figures 2000, Fact & Figures 2005, Mitsubishi Motors website)\"\n"}
{"id": "1919436", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1919436", "title": "Sa'sa'", "text": "Sa'sa'\n\nSa'sa' (, ) was a Palestinian village, located 12 kilometres northwest of Safed that was depopulated by Israeli forces during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. The village suffered two massacres committed by Haganah forces: one in mid-February 1948 and the other at the end of October the same year. Its place has been taken since 1949 by Sasa, an Israeli kibbutz.\n\nSa'sa' was built on the site of a Bronze Age (early second millennium B.C.) settlement whose remains (walls, tombs, cisterns, and olive and wine presses), have been unearthed. One village house had foundations which has been dated back to fourth century by archaeologists. Another excavated in 2003 yielded ceramics dated to the fourteenth–fifteenth centuries CE.\n\nThe Arab geographer Abū 'Ubayd 'Abd Allāh al-Bakrī (d.1094) reported that one passed through Sa'sa' when travelling from Dayr al-Qasi to Safad.\n\nIn 1516 Sa'sa', with the rest of Palestine, came under the control of the Ottoman Empire. Shortly after, Sa'sa' was made a checkpoint where a toll was collected on various goods and travellers; the first records of such taxes are from 1525/6.\n\nIn 1596 Sa'sa' was classified as a village in the \"nahiya\" (\"subdistrict\") of Jira, part of \"liwa'\" (\"district\") of Safad, with a population of 457. It paid taxes on wheat, barley, olives and fruits, as well as on goats, beehives, and vineyards. According to this tax records, all the villagers were Muslim. In the eighteenth century Sa'sa' in mentioned as one of the fortified villages of Galilee controlled by Zahir al-Umar's son, Ali. After the defeat of Zahir al-Umar in 1775 Ali continued to resist the Ottoman authorities and defeated an army sent against him at Sa'sa'.\n\nExcavations in 1972 on the west side of the hill revealed the remains of a large rectangular structure (15m x 41 m) with 2m thick walls made out of rubble stone with ashlar facing. At the south-west corner of the building there was a solid semi-circular tower (diameter 7m). The main part of the structure is a rectangular hall divided into two rows of five bays. There was a central row of four piers and two half-piers which would probably have supported a cross-vaulted roof. In a later phase an outer skin (2m wide) was added, making the wall a total of 4m thick. At the same time the round tower was converted into a square plan. According to the excavators, the place was occupied for a \"fairly long\" period, and suggest that it was probably part of the fortress built by Ali, (son of Zahir al-Umar) in the eighteenth century. The design of the building is quite compatible with other fortresses of the period, like Qalat Jiddin and Dayr Hanna.\n\nIn 1875, Victor Guérin found it to be a Muslim village with about 350 inhabitants.\n\nIn 1881, the PEF's \"Survey of Western Palestine\" (SWP) described Sa'sa' as a village with a population of 300, built on a slight hill that was surrounded by vineyards and olive and fig trees.\n\nA population list from about 1887 showed \"Sa'sa\"' to have about 1,740 inhabitants; all Muslims.\n\nPottery vessels from the Rashaya al-Fukhar workshops, dating to the late Ottoman and early Mandate eras have been found here.\n\nIn the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, \"Sa'sa\" had a population of 634; all Muslim, increasing in the 1931 census to 840, still all Muslims, in a total of 154 houses.\n\nThe village had a small market-place in the village center with a few shops, as well as a mosque and two elementary schools, one for girls and one for boys.\n\nIn the 1944/45 statistics the village had a population of 1,130 Muslims and a total land area of 14,796 dunams. Of this, 4,496 dunums were used for cereals; 1,404 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards, while 48 dunams were built-up (urban) area.\nIn February 1948, Yigal Allon, commander of the Palmach in the north, ordered an attack on Sa'sa'. The order was given to Moshe Kelman, the deputy commander of Third Battalion. The order read: \"You have to blow up twenty houses and kill as many warriors as possible\". According to Pappé, the quote says which said \"warriors\" should be read \"villagers\". Khalidi, referencing \"The History of the Haganah\" by Ben-Zion Dinur, say they referred to the massacre as \"one of the most daring raids into enemy territory.\"\n\nOn February 15, 1948, a Palmach unit entered the village during the night and, without resistance, planted explosives against some of the houses. It was reported at the time that ten or more houses were totally or partially destroyed and 11 villagers were killed (5 of them small children).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1919437", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1919437", "title": "The Civilizing Process", "text": "The Civilizing Process\n\nThe Civilizing Process is a book by German sociologist Norbert Elias. It is an influential work in sociology and Elias' most important work. It was first published in Basel, Switzerland in two volumes in 1939 in German as \"Über den Prozeß der Zivilisation\". \n\nBecause of World War II, it was virtually ignored, but gained popularity when it was republished in 1969 and translated into English. Covering European history from roughly 800 AD to 1900 AD, it is the first formal analysis and theory of civilization. Elias proposes a double sociogenesis of the state: the social development of the state has two sides, a mental and political. The civilisation process that Elias describes results in a profound change in human behaviour. It leads to the construction of the modern state and transition of man from the warrior of the Middle Ages to the civil man of the end of the 19th c.\n\n\"The Civilizing Process\" is today regarded as the founding work of Figurational Sociology. In 1998 the International Sociological Association listed the work as the seventh most important sociological book of the 20th century.\n\nThe first volume, \"The History of Manners\", traces the historical developments of the European \"habitus\", or \"second nature\", the particular individual psychic structures molded by social attitudes. Elias traced how post-medieval European standards regarding violence, sexual behaviour, bodily functions, table manners and forms of speech were gradually transformed by increasing thresholds of shame and repugnance, working outward from a nucleus in court etiquette. The internalized \"self-restraint\" imposed by increasingly complex networks of social connections developed the \"psychological\" self-perceptions that Freud recognized as the \"super-ego\".\n\nThe second volume, \"State Formation and Civilization\", looks into the formation of the state and the theory of civilisation. First, Elias explains that throughout time, social unity increased its control over military and fiscal power until possessing the monopoly over it. The progressive monopolisation of the military and taxation were feeding another (the political power was using tax money to pay its army and using the army to collect the taxes). Elias describes several steps of the creation of the State: \n\n\nAt the end of the process, the State is created and possessed the monopoly of legitimate physical violence. Elias also describes that the \"absolutist mechanism\": the state became the supreme body that coordinates the different interdependent group of the society. \n\nIn parallel of the sociogeneses of the state, Elias notes the change in the way to manage the bodily functions. Individuals tried to repress in themselves what is perceived to be part of animal nature, repress in a sphere that appears through time, intimacy. Hence, new feelings appeared: embarrassment and prudishness.\n\nWhen Elias' work found a larger audience in the 1960s, at first his analysis of the process was misunderstood as an extension of discredited \"social Darwinism\", the idea of upward \"progress\" was dismissed by reading it as consecutive history rather than a metaphor for a social process. It soon became obvious that Elias had intended no moral \"superiority\". Instead he describes the increasing structuring and restraining of human behavior in European history, a process termed as \"civilization\" by its own protagonists. Elias had merely intended to analyze this concept and process dubbed civilization, and researched into its origins, patterns, and methods.\n\nA particular criticism of \"The Civilizing Process\" was formulated by German ethnologist and cultural anthropologist Hans Peter Duerr in his 5-volume \"Der Mythos vom Zivilisationsprozeß\" (1988–2002), pointing out there existed plenty of social restrictions and regulations in Western culture and elsewhere since long before the Medieval period. Elias and his supporters responded that he had never intended to claim that social regulations or self-restraining psychological agents would be institutions singular to Western modernity, it is just that Western culture developed particularly sophisticated, concise, comprehensive, and rigid institutions apparent for instance in its decisive technological advances when compared to other cultures.\n\n\n"}

The company employs over 5,000 people worldwide in 32 locations around Europe, America, Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Headquartered in the City of London, it is traded on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. \n\nSchroders bears the name of the Schröder family, a prominent Hanseatic family of Hamburg with branches in other countries. The Schroder family, through trustee companies, individual ownership and charities, control 47.93 per cent of the company's ordinary shares.\n\nSchroders' history began in 1804 when Johann Heinrich Schröder (John Henry) became a partner in the London-based firm of his brother, Johann Friedrich (John Frederick). In 1818 J. Henry Schröder & Co. was established in London.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, Schroders \"issued £3m bonds in 1863 for the Confederacy.\"\n\nKey events in the development of the business include the establishment of J Henry Schroder Banking Corporation ('Schrobanco') as a commercial bank in New York in 1923, the public offering of the shares in J. Henry Schroder & Co. Ltd on the London Stock Exchange in 1959 and the acquisition of Helbert, Wagg & Co, a leading issuing house, in 1962.\n\nIn 1986 the company disposed of Schrobanco, its commercial banking arm in New York and acquired 50% of Wertheim & Co., a mid-tier New York based investment bank, whose activities more closely mirrored those of the London business.\n\nSchroders played a leading role in the privatisations carried out by the UK Government in the 1980s and was to grow dramatically under Winfried Bischoff. Schroders was worth £30 million when he took over as CEO in 1984: yet in 2000 the company sold its investment banking division to Citigroup for £1.3 billion. Citigroup's European investment banking arm traded as Schroder Salomon Smith Barney from 2000 to 2003.\n\nIn 2013, Schroders purchased the capital management arm of Cazenove in a deal worth £424 million.\n\nAs at 31 December 2018, Schroders was responsible for assets worth £421.4 billion on behalf of clients including corporations, insurance companies, local and public authorities, charities, pension funds, high-net-worth individuals and retail investors.\n\nIn June 2014, Schroders' Multi-Asset Investments and Portfolio Solutions (MAPS) announced a collaboration with Professor Anthony G.

He is best known for his roles as PC/DC Jim Carver in \"The Bill\" and \"EastEnders\" as Mike Swann, \"Hollyoaks\" as Frank Symons and \"Heartbeat\" as Terry Molloy.\n\nWingett was born in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire. His father was an officer in the Royal Navy, and the family moved to wherever he was stationed, including Malta and Singapore, but mostly in Portsmouth.\n\nWingett wanted to act from his youth and joined the National Youth Theatre. His film debut came in 1979 when he played Dave, a reckless and rebellious mod, in \"Quadrophenia\". Because the film was X-rated, he was too young to watch it legally.\n\nIn 1983 he made his first appearance as PC Jim Carver in \"Woodentop\", which became the pilot episode for \"The Bill\". He was one of four actors in \"Woodentop\" who returned in the series' first complete season. He played Jim Carver in around 780 episodes, from 1984 until his departure in 2005 which ended 21 years on The Bill. Jim Carver was central to several major plotlines on \"The Bill\", including the character's struggles with alcoholism, gambling and as a victim of domestic violence. Wingett made a brief return in March 2007 to coincide with the departure of Trudie Goodwin, then the only other remaining original cast member.\n\nIn 2005 he appeared in the BBC One soap opera \"EastEnders\" as Mike Swann, the father of Mickey Miller and Dawn Swann, initially for a week-long stint. He returned to the soap in late 2005, leaving in March 2006. Also in 2005 he appeared as Terry Molloy, a London gangster who had turned Queen's evidence on his cohorts following a robbery in the \"Heartbeat\" episode \"A Fresh Start.\"\n\nWingett provides the voiceover for the British television version of the hit American TV series \"American Chopper\" aired on the Discovery Channel. He also appeared in the \"Spartacus\" episode of the BBC's \"Heroes and Villains\" as the gladiator trainer Lentulus Batiatus.\n\nIn 2009, he appeared in the BBC daytime series \"Missing\" as Danny Hayworth alongside Pauline Quirke, returning to the programme for its second series in 2010.\n\nIn addition to acting, Wingett has directed several stage productions. In 2010, he directed the play \"Good to Firm\" by Ed Waugh and Trevor Wood at the Customs House, South Shields. In 2000, Wingett directed the play \"Lone Star\" by James McLure, in a production which toured Australia and starred his fellow \"Bill\" cast members Russell Boulter and Huw Higginson.\n\nWingett's partner is Sharon Martin, a makeup artist. They have a daughter, Jamila, and a stepson Benny from Martin's previous relationship. The couple separated in 2000 after Yvonne Williams, a fire-eater who had appeared on \"The Bill\" as an extra, went to the press detailing her affair with Wingett over a number of years, but had reconciled by 2003 after a two-year separation. They both worked on the 2012 film \"Snow White and the Huntsman\", with Martin as head of the makeup department and Wingett playing the character of Thomas.\n\nWingett is a keen scuba diver, fisherman, skier and wreck hunter. He started diving in 1984 at a sub-aqua club for London black cab driverss.\n\nWingett's sister, Fiona Wingett, is a magazine editor. She was the editor of \"New Idea\" magazine in Australia in the mid-1990s, then returned to Britain to edit the \"Personal\" magazine for the \"Sunday Mirror\". His brother, Matthew Wingett, wrote several episodes of \"The Bill\" in the 1990s. His first episode, \"Thicker than Water\" was submitted under the false name \"Matthew Brothers\", so that it would not receive favourable treatment because of their relationship.\n\nIn 2018, Wingett recorded a two-part interview for \"The Bill Podcast\" celebrating his life and career.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1919470", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1919470", "title": "St Bartholomew's Hospital", "text": "St Bartholomew's Hospital\n\nSt Bartholomew's Hospital, commonly known as Barts, is a teaching hospital located in the City of London. It was founded in 1123 and is currently run by Barts Health NHS Trust.\n\nBarts was founded in 1123 by Rahere (died 1144, and entombed in the nearby Priory Church of St Bartholomew the Great), a favourite courtier of King Henry I. The Dissolution of the Monasteries did not affect the running of Barts as a hospital, but left it in a precarious position by removing its income. It was refounded by King Henry VIII in December 1546, on the signing of an agreement granting the hospital to the Corporation of London.\n\nThe hospital became legally styled as the \"House of the Poore in Farringdon in the suburbs of the City of London of Henry VIII's Foundation\", although the title was never used by the general public. The first Superintendent of the hospital was Thomas Vicary, sergeant-surgeon to King Henry, and an early writer on anatomy. It was here that William Harvey conducted his research on the circulatory system in the 17th century, Percivall Pott and John Abernethy developed important principles of modern surgery in the 18th century, and Mrs Bedford Fenwick worked to advance the nursing profession in the late 19th century.\n\nIn 1839 to 1872, the mortality reports show that surgical trauma and postoperative infection were the greatest causes of death. Tuberculosis, however, remained the most fatal nontraumatic cause of death. Nurses were expected to work 12 hours a day, and sometimes 14, with meal breaks in 1890. They had 2 weeks annual holiday. Upon the creation of the National Health Service in 1948, it officially became known as St Bartholomew's Hospital.\n\nBarts is the oldest hospital in Britain still providing medical services which occupies the site it was originally built on, and has an important current role as well as a long history and architecturally important buildings. The so-named Henry VIII entrance to the hospital continues to be the main public entrance; and the statue of King Henry VIII above the gate is the only remaining statue of him in London.\n\nIts main square was designed by James Gibbs in the 1730s. Of the four original blocks only three survive; they include the block containing the Great Hall and two flanking blocks that contained wards. The first wing to be built was the North Wing, in 1732, which includes the Great Hall and the murals by William Hogarth. The South Wing followed in 1740, the West in 1752 and finally the East Wing in 1769. In 1859, a fountain was placed at the square's centre with a small garden.\n\nSt Bartholomew's Hospital has existed on the same site since its founding in the 12th century, surviving both the Great Fire of London and the Blitz. Its museum, which is open Tuesdays to Fridays every week, shows how medical care has developed over this time and explains the history of the hospital. Part-way around the exhibition is a door which opens on to the hospital's official entrance hall. On the walls of the staircase are two murals painted by William Hogarth, \"The Pool of Bethesda\" (1736) and \"The Good Samaritan\" (1737). They can only be seen at close quarters on Friday afternoons. Hogarth was so outraged by the news that the hospital was commissioning art from Italian painters that he insisted on doing these murals free of charge, as a demonstration that English painting was equal to the task. \"The Pool of Bethesda\" is of particular medical interest, as it depicts a scene in which Christ cures the sick: display material on the first floor speculates in modern medical terms about the ailments from which Christ's patients in the painting are suffering.\nThe room to which the staircase leads is the hospital's Great Hall, a double-height room in Baroque-style. Although there are a few paintings inside the Great Hall, nearly all are on movable stands: the walls themselves are mostly given over to the display of the very many large, painted plaques which list, in detail, the sums of money given to the hospital by its benefactors.\n\nAfter the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the hospital precincts of the ancient priory were redesignated as an Anglican ecclesiastical parish, with St Bartholomew-the-Less becoming the parish church – a unique situation amongst English hospital foundations. St Barts-the-Less is the only survivor of five chapels originally within the hospital's estate, the others failing to survive the Reformation. The church has a 15th-century tower and vestry, and its connections with the hospital can be seen not only in its early-20th century stained glass window of a nurse, a gift from the Worshipful Company of Glaziers, but also in commemorative plaques adorning its interior.\n\nThroughout the whole of the 19th century, the Hardwick family were major benefactors of the hospital. Thomas Hardwick Jr. (1752–1825), Philip Hardwick (1792–1870), and Philip Charles Hardwick (1822–1892) were all architects/surveyors to Barts Hospital. Philip Hardwick, a Royal Academician, was also engaged in the rebuilding of the Church of St Bartholomew-the-Less in 1823 and donated the fountain in the hospital's courtyard.\n\nBy 1872, Barts contained 676 beds. About 6,000 in-patients were admitted every year, as well as 101,000 out-patients. The average income of the hospital was £40,000 (derived chiefly from rents and funded property) and the number of governors exceeded 300.\n\nIn 1993 the controversial Tomlinson Review of London hospitals was published and concluded that there were too many hospitals in central London. It recommended that the service should be delivered closer to where people lived. Barts was identified as a hospital with a catchment area that had a low population and the hospital was threatened with closure. A determined campaign was mounted to save the hospital by the \"Save Barts Campaign\", supported by staff, residents, local MPs and the City of London Corporation.\n\nSome facilities were saved, but the accident and emergency department closed in 1995, with facilities relocated to the Royal London Hospital (a hospital in the same trust group, but a couple of miles away in Whitechapel). A minor injuries unit was established at Barts for small cases (which often represent a significant part of the workload of A&E services) but urgent and major work goes to other hospitals.\n\nA plan was formulated for Barts to develop as a centre of excellence in cardiac care and cancer. The plan came under threat when it was announced that the works would be procured under a private finance initiative contract; the \"Save Barts\" campaign continued to protest. The opposition subsided and a new Barts Heart Centre and new cancer care facilities were created. The Queen Mary Wing was demolished and the façade of the George V building was retained within a new hospital building. A new main entrance was established on King Edward Street. The three James Gibbs blocks were refurbished and car parking was removed from the area. The works, which were designed by HOK and undertaken by Skanska at a cost of circa £500 million, were completed in early 2016.\n\nBarts continues to be associated with excellence at its medical school's significant research and teaching facilities on the Charterhouse Square site. Barts, along with the Royal London Hospital and London Chest Hospital, was part of Barts and The London NHS Trust. There are 388 beds in Barts, 675 beds in the Royal London and 109 in the London Chest Hospital. These hospitals amalgamated with Whipps Cross and Newham hospitals on 1 March 2012 to form the Barts Health NHS Trust.\n\nIn 2018, Nuffield Health, a not-for-profit healthcare organisation, was granted planning permission to redevelop the former pathology and residential staff quarters building into a new private hospital. It will be the only private hospital in the City of London, and will have 48 beds and 4 operating theatres. It is expected to open in 2021, at a cost of £60 million. It will be physically and operationally separate from the rest of the hospital, and will be known as Nuffield Health at St Bartholomew's Hospital.\n\nIn 1843, St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College was established to train medics although considered to have been started by John Abernethy when the hospital built a theatre for his lectures at the beginning of the century. In 1995 the college, along with that attached to the Royal London, merged into Queen Mary University of London, but maintains a distinctive identity to this day. It is now known as Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry. It occupies some space at the Barts site in Farringdon, with a presence a short walk away at Charterhouse Square. The main preclinical teaching domain of the medical school is at Whitechapel in the award-winning Blizard Building.\n\nThe present School of Nursing and Midwifery was formed in 1994 from merging the Schools from St Bartholomew's Hospital and the Royal London Hospital to become the St Bartholomew School of Nursing & Midwifery. In 1995 the new School was incorporated into the City University. Both Schools have a strong and respected history dating back over 120 years and have produced many nurse leaders and educators. The School has since been incorporated into the School of Health Sciences, City University London.\n\n\nThe Barts Museum tells the historical narrative of the hospital and its work in caring for the sick and injured. The museum collections include historic surgical instruments, sculptures, medieval archives, and works of art, including paintings by William Hogarth. The museum is part of the London Museums of Health & Medicine group, and has been described as one of the world's \"10 weirdest medical museums.\"\n\nThe museum is located under the North Wing archway and is open from Tuesday to Friday from 10 am to 4 pm. Admission is free, but donations are welcome. The collections are searchable on the Barts Health NHS Trust online catalogue, which contains information on over 50,000 entries and covering an 800-year span.\n\nA chemical laboratory at Barts was the location of the initial meeting of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson in Arthur Conan Doyle's 1887 novel \"A Study in Scarlet\". Barts was Watson's alma mater. This fictional connection led to a donation by the Tokyo \"Sherlock Holmes Appreciation Society\" to the Save Barts Campaign in the 1990s.\n\nIn 2012, the final episode of the second series of the BBC drama \"Sherlock\", \"The Reichenbach Fall\", had Holmes appearing to have deliberately leapt to his death from the roof of St Bartholomew's as a surrogate for the waterfall of the original story \"The Final Problem\". The hospital was again used as the location for the resolution to Holmes' faked suicide, in the first series three episode \"The Empty Hearse\".\n\nLondon Buses routes 4, 8, 17, 25, 45, 46, 56, 63, 76, 100, 153, 172, 242, 521, N8, N63 and N76 serve the hospital, with bus stops located outside or near the hospital. The nearest Underground stations are Barbican and Farringdon on the Circle, Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan lines and St Paul's on the Central line. Farringdon is also served by Thameslink trains.\n\n\n"}

He was numbered as a member of the Céli Dé, an abbot of Cork Abbey and Clonfert Abbey, and possibly a bishop. After his death, he was later considered a saint in some martyrologies.\n\nFedelmid was of the Cenél Fíngin sept of the Eóganacht Chaisil branch of the Eóganachta, and he is noted as having assumed the sovereignty of Munster in 820. In 823, in co-operation with Bishop Artrí mac Conchobar of Armagh, he had the \"Law of St. Patrick\" established in Munster\", and sacked the monastery, that of Gailline of the Britons, in modern County Offaly. The Dealbhna Breatha was burnt by Fedelmid in 825. In 827, there is the first of a number of royal meetings between Fedelmid and Conchobar mac Donnchada, the Southern Uí Néill, King of Tara or High King of Ireland.\n\nIn 830, Fedelmid was back burning monasteries this time it was probably that of Fore Abbey in modern County Westmeath, while in Southern Galway, he destroyed the Uí Briúin, and in the same year, the Munstermen were recorded as killing Folloman, son of Donnchad, brother of Conchobhar, the High King of Ireland. In 831 and 832, he is recorded as taking an army of Leinster and Munster into East Meath, plundering as far north as Slane, while also raiding the Dealbhna Beatha of southern Offaly three times, and burning Clonmacnoise. In 833, he is back in Clonmacnoise burning it and the Clann Cholmáin monastery of Durrow to the door of their churches. In 835, the Munstermen are recorded as having slain Fergus, son of Bodbchad, the King of Carraic-Brachaidhe, from the very north-west of country, Inishowen.\n\nIn 836, Fedelmid took the oratory in Kildare, against Forindam, the abbot of Armagh, and had him and the congregation of Patrick congregation imprisoned. In 837, Fedelmid is recording as taking the abbacy of Cork, and also he plundered the Cenél Cairpri Cruim. In 838, there was a great royal meeting in Cluain-Conaire-Tommain (north modern Kildare) between Fedelmid and Niall Caille mac Áeda, the King of the Northern Uí Néill, as a result of which the Annals of Inisfallen, presumably acting on Munster tradition, that Fedelmid became full king of Ireland that day and occupied the abbot's chair of Clonfert.\n\nThe year 840 was probably the high point of Fedelmid's rule, when he ravaged the east midland kingdoms of Mide and Brega and is recorded as having rested in Temhar (Tara), and the annals have a short poem on this:\"Feidhlimid is the King,<br>\nTo whom it was but one day’s work<br>\n[To obtain] the pledges of Connaught without battle,<br>\nAnd to devastate Midhe.\"\nHowever, this was short lived and in 841, he was defeated in battle by Niall Caille at Magh-Ochtar in Kildare, a presumably meet with surprise, as the following verse suggest:\nThe crozier of the devout Feidlimid,<br>\nWas abandoned in the blackthorns,<br>\nNiall, mighty in combat, took it,<br>\nBy right of victory in battle with swords.\nFedelmid does not appear to have recovered from this defeat and died in 847. Although the cause of his death is not noted in the Annals of Ulster, the majority of the other sources, place the cause of his death on St. Kieran, the patron saint of Clonmacnoise, as revenge for Fedelmid's plunderings of the site. The Annals of Clonmacnoise offers the following description:\nAfter his returne to Munster ye next year, he was overtaken by a great disease of the flux of the belly, which happened in this wide. As King felym (soone after his return to Mounster) was taking his rest inn his bed, St. Wueran appeared to him with his habit and bachall.. & there gave him a push of his Bachall in his belly whereof he tooke his disease and occasiontion of Death, and notwithstanding his great irregularity and great desire of spoyle he was of sum numbered among the scribes and anchorites of Ireland.\n\n\n\n"}

The region consistently includes the states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana and Wyoming. Some sources include Southeast Alaska in the Northwest. The related but distinct term \"Pacific Northwest\" generally excludes areas from the Rockies eastward.\n\nThe Northwestern United States is a subportion of the Western United States (which is, itself, even more ambiguous). In contrast, states included in the neighboring regions (Southwestern United States and Great Plains) and Utah are not simultaneously considered part of both regions.\n\nLike the southwestern United States, the Northwest definition has moved westward over time. The current area includes the old Oregon Territory (created in 1848–Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and areas in Montana west of the Continental Divide). The region is similar to Federal Region X, which comprises Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Alaska.\n\nIt is home to over 14.2 million people. Some of the fastest growing cities in this region and in the nation include Seattle, Spokane, Bellevue, Tacoma, Kennewick, Pasco, Yakima, Portland, Eugene, Salem, Boise, Idaho Falls, Missoula, Bozeman, and Billings.\n\nAs the United States' westward expansion, the country's western border also shifted westward, and consequently, so did the location of the Northwestern and Southwestern United States. In the early years of the United States, newly colonized lands lying immediately west of the Allegheny Mountains were detached from Virginia and given the name Northwest Territory. During the decades that followed, the Northwest Territory covered much of the Great Lakes region east of the Mississippi River.\n\nAs of 2016, the Northwestern states have a cumulative population of 14,297,316, with Oregon and Washington accounting for 77% of the entire five-state region's population. As of 2016, there are 25 metropolitan statistical areas in the Northwest with populations of 100,000 or more, none of which are in Wyoming. Since adjacent metropolitan areas often function as one combined agglomeration, the U.S. Census Bureau additionally defines nine combined statistical areas across the Northwest, eight of which having populations of 100,000 or more.\n\n"}

{"id": "1919475", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1919475", "title": "Artur Boruc", "text": "Artur Boruc\n\nArtur Boruc (; born 20 February 1980) is a Polish professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for club AFC Bournemouth.\n\nHe began his career in the Polish third division with hometown club Pogoń Siedlce. He joined Ekstraklasa team Legia Warsaw in 1999 and, whilst still a reserve, had a spell on loan at Dolcan Ząbki in 2000. Boruc broke through to the Legia first team in 2002 and by 2003 had become the club's first choice goalkeeper. In the summer of 2005, he joined Scottish Premier League side Celtic. In his five years in Glasgow, Boruc made 221 appearances for the club, winning the league three times, the Scottish Cup once and the Scottish League Cup twice. Celtic fans nicknamed Boruc 'The Holy Goalie' for his devout Catholicism. He moved to Italy in 2010 to join Fiorentina, spending two years at the Serie A club before returning to Britain in 2012 to sign for Premier League side Southampton, moving to Bournemouth in 2015 after a season on loan.\n\nBoruc made his international debut against the Republic of Ireland in April 2004 and became a regular in the Polish international squad, earning 65 caps. He represented the nation at the 2006 FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 2008 and UEFA Euro 2016. In November 2017, Boruc retired from international football.\n\nBorn in Siedlce, Boruc began his career in 1998 at Pogoń Siedlce, in his hometown.\n\nThe next season Boruc joined Legia Warsaw, initially playing for the reserve team, as well as being loaned out in 2000 for half a season to Dolcan Ząbki.\n\nOn 8 March 2002, Boruc played his first league match for Legia when he came on as a substitute during a 2–2 draw against Pogoń Szczecin. This unexpected debut was due to an injury sustained by Bulgarian goalkeeper, Radostin Stanev, during the game. Boruc played in Legia's next four league matches and kept clean sheets against Wisła Kraków and Odra Wodzisław, although Stanev regained his place in the side upon his return from injury for the remaining league and cup fixtures. Legia went on to win the Ekstraklasa title that season for the first time in seven years.\n\nIn the second half of the following season, 2002–03, Boruc established himself as the club's first choice goalkeeper where he played in 11 of the club's last 15 league fixtures. Legia lost only 1 of these 11 matches and Boruc kept 5 clean sheets, although Legia only managed to finish fourth.\n\nBy the 2003–04 season, Boruc was very much a first-pick for Legia and played in all 26 of their league fixtures. In June 2004, Boruc scored his only goal for the club, converting a penalty kick in a home game against Widzew Łódź (final score: 6–0) and then celebrated by waving the corner flag. Legia finished second in the league and qualified for the following season's UEFA Cup. Boruc also made his first appearance for Poland in April 2004, playing in a scoreless draw against the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe 2004–05 season saw Boruc remain Legia's key player and a fan-favourite, again playing in all of the club's league fixtures. Boruc's performances for Legia saw the club extend his contract up to 2012. In March 2005, Boruc was made captain of the side. However, it was another disappointing league campaign for Legia, as they came a distant third behind Wisła Kraków who finished as champions for the third year in a row. Legia's UEFA Cup run was also relatively brief, disposing of FC Tbilisi 7–0 on aggregate in a relatively easy qualifying tie before going out 1–4 on aggregate in the first-round proper to Austria Wien. Despite the lack of silverware though, Boruc's form was by the summer of 2005 attracting attention from abroad.\n\nOn 20 July 2005, Boruc signed with Scottish club Celtic. The deal was initially a year's loan, with an option to make it permanent. The move was later made permanent, with Boruc penning a three-and-a-half-year contract on 17 October until 2009. On 5 January 2008, it was reported that Boruc had signed a new contract with Celtic set to keep him at the club until 2011.\n\nBoruc made his debut for Celtic on 2 August 2005 when he replaced David Marshall for the second leg of their UEFA Champions League qualifier tie against Slovakian side Artmedia Bratislava. Celtic won 4–0, but having lost the first leg 5–0 still went out on aggregate. Boruc quickly established himself as first-choice keeper at Celtic, displaying a combination of outstanding shot-stopping, immense self-belief and, at times, outright arrogance. Indeed, gestures allegedly made by Boruc towards Rangers fans at Ibrox Stadium on 12 February 2006 later resulted in the player being cautioned by the police. In his first season, he made 40 appearances and kept 17 clean sheets. Boruc also added to his winner's medals collection as Celtic won the Scottish Premier League and the Scottish League Cup, the latter after beating Dunfermline Athletic 3–0.\nBoruc continued his fine form for Celtic the following season. On 21 November 2006, in a UEFA Champions League match against Manchester United at Celtic Park, Boruc helped Celtic through to the knockout stage of the competition by saving Louis Saha's 89th-minute penalty. Indeed, Boruc succeeded in keeping a clean sheet in each of Celtic's three home Champions League group stages games (Copenhagen 1–0, Benfica 3–0 and Manchester United 1–0). He was named player of the month for December 2006 in the Scottish Premier League, a very uncommon event for a goalkeeper. His form was also recognised with a nomination for the Scottish PFA Players' Player of the Year award for 2007. The season culminated in more silverware for Boruc as Celtic retained their Scottish Premier League title and defeated Dunfermline 1–0 on 26 May 2007 to win the Scottish Cup.\n\nThe start of the 2007–08 season saw Celtic drawn against Russian side Spartak Moscow in the third qualifying round for the Champions League. The tie ended in a penalty shootout, with Boruc saving twice to ensure Celtic's passage to the group stages. The season also saw Celtic complete a hat-trick of consecutive Scottish Premier League titles.\n\nBoruc was fined an estimated £50,000 by Celtic in August 2008 for breaching the club's drinking policy after a pre-season friendly in the Netherlands against Feyenoord.\n\nBoruc endured a decline of form in the first half of season 2008–09 as he committed several goalkeeping errors, in particular against Rangers in a 2–4 defeat at Parkhead on 31 August 2008 where he was badly at fault for Rangers fourth goal, and against Hibernian at Easter Road on 7 December 2008, where John Rankin scored against him from 45 yards out, a goal Rankin later referred to as a \"squiggler.\" He did however save a James McArthur penalty in a 4–0 win over Hamilton Academical on 4 October 2008. Despite this run of relatively poor performances, Boruc was one of 55 players (including five goalkeepers) shortlisted on 20 October 2008 for the FIFPro World XI Player Awards. Discipline, however, also became an issue again, with Boruc fined £500 by the Scottish Football Association (SFA) for gestures he made towards Rangers fans during the Old Firm game in August.\n\nOn 28 January 2009, Boruc converted a penalty for Celtic during the penalty shootout in the semi-final match of the League Cup against Dundee United, helping Celtic to an 11–10 win on penalties. Boruc picked up his last silverware at Celtic in the same tournament a couple of months later when Celtic defeated Rangers 2–0 after extra-time in the Scottish League Cup Final.\n\nOn 12 December 2009, Boruc made his 200th appearance for Celtic against Motherwell, which Celtic won 3–2. In April 2010, he won the Scottish Premier League save of the season award for a reflex save against Hibernian at Easter Road in August 2009.\n\nOn 4 May 2010, Boruc made the last appearance of his Celtic career in a 2–1 victory against Old Firm rivals Rangers, although he had to be substituted in the second half as he was unable to continue playing due to an injury he sustained to his hand in the pre-match warm up. This transpired to be a broken finger and ruled him out of the final league fixture of the season.\n\nOn 12 July 2010, Celtic agreed to sell Boruc to Serie A club Fiorentina subject to a medical, for an undisclosed fee. The transfer was confirmed three days later.\n\nHe made his Fiorentina debut on 26 October 2010 in the Coppa Italia against Empoli. After an injury to first-choice goalkeeper Sébastien Frey, he made his Serie A debut in a 1–0 win over Chievo on 7 November 2010. Boruc went on to play in the next 25 Serie A fixtures, before Frey regained his place in the team for the final two league games of the season.\n\nOn 18 August 2011, Boruc officially claimed Fiorentina's number one jersey after Frey's move to Genoa. For the next year, Boruc played in all but two of Fiorentina's Serie A fixtures, but despite this he was criticised for some of his performances and apparent lack of fitness. After two seasons in Italy, Boruc was released by Fiorentina in July 2012.\n\nOn 22 September 2012, Boruc joined Premier League club Southampton on a one-year deal. He made his debut on 20 October in a 4–1 defeat away to West Ham United at Upton Park.\n\nOn 28 October 2012, he was allegedly involved in an incident following Tottenham Hotspur's second goal, when he responded to the jeers coming from behind him by sarcastically applauding the home fans, before throwing a water bottle in their direction. The incident resulted in Boruc being dropped from the side.\n\nDespite the early controversy in his Southampton career, Boruc regained his place in the first team and played in all the club's league matches from 1 January 2013 to the end of the season. On 9 March 2013 in a league match against Norwich City at Carrow Road, Boruc saved a penalty in the 90th minute from Grant Holt. The game finished 0–0, with Southampton winning a point in their bid to avoid relegation. Boruc's form since returning to the Southampton first team resulted in manager Mauricio Pochettino expressing a desire for Boruc to be signed up on a longer-term deal at Southampton. On 18 April 2013 this wish was realised when Boruc signed a new 2-year contract for the club. Southampton's 1–1 draw with Sunderland on 12 May 2013 ensured their Premier League status for the following season., and they eventually finished in 14th place at the end of season.\n\nNow firmly established as first-choice goalkeeper at Southampton, Boruc helped his team make an excellent start to the 2013–14 season. The club's 2–0 win over Fulham on 26 October 2013 saw the team move to 18 points and into third place in the Premier League, their best-ever start to a top-flight season.\n\nOn 2 November 2013, in a 1–1 draw at Stoke City, Boruc conceded a goal to opposing goalkeeper Asmir Begović after just 13 seconds. Three weeks later, under pressure from Arsenal's Olivier Giroud, \"instead of simply clearing he did one Cruyff turn, then another, before tying himself into so many knots attempting a third that Giroud was able to nick the ball off him\" and score the first of Arsenal's two goals. A week later, he suffered a broken hand trying to keep out a Demba Ba goal in a 3–1 defeat against Chelsea, which kept him out for six weeks. Boruc returned from injury on 11 January 2014 and kept a clean sheet in Southampton's 1–0 win over West Bromwich Albion, impressing with a last minute save from Shane Long to deny the club an equaliser. Boruc maintained his place in his side, and although he was at fault for one of Sunderland's goals in a 2–2 draw on 18 January, he redeemed himself with better performances in 1–0 and 3–0 league wins over Fulham and Hull City respectively during February 2014. His form remained reasonably consistent, although his distribution was occasionally poor, and he helped Southampton to an eighth-place finish in the league at the end of the season.\n\nAt the start of the 2014–15 season, Fraser Forster arrived at Southampton from Celtic in a £10 million transfer deal, with the Englishman taking over Boruc's place in goal. On 19 September 2014, Boruc joined Championship side AFC Bournemouth on an emergency loan deal until January 2015. He made his debut the following day in a 1–1 draw away against Watford. On 25 October, Bournemouth won 0–8 away at St. Andrew's against Birmingham City. It was the first time that the Cherries had ever scored eight goals in a league game (barring a 10–0 win over Northampton Town in September 1939 which was expunged from the records after World War II broke out the next day), and they recorded their biggest winning margin in a league fixture. Boruc played his part in this statistic by saving a penalty taken by Paul Caddis in the 53rd minute with the score at 0–3. The loan spell at Bournemouth went well, and by the end of December 2014, Boruc had kept clean sheets in nine of his 18 appearances, helping the club go top of the Championship. As such, the loan was extended to the end of the season, with Boruc commenting, \"I'm pleased I'm here and that I'm part of a great team, and that's why I'm staying until the end of the season.\"\n\nOn 2 May 2015, Boruc was part of the Bournemouth team which won the Championship title and a first-ever promotion to the Premier League. Twenty-four days later, he was one of six players released by Southampton,\n\nBoruc began the 2015–16 season as Bournemouth's first choice goalkeeper, starting the club's first ever top division match against Aston Villa on 8 August 2015. His and the club's first clean sheet came in a 2–0 defeat of Sunderland at Dean Court on 19 September.\n\nAfter a poor performance in a 1–5 home defeat by Tottenham Hotspur on 25 October, Boruc was replaced in the Bournemouth goal by Adam Federici for all four of the Cherries' November fixtures. An injury to Federici saw Boruc return to the side for an away fixture at Premier League champions Chelsea on 5 December, with the Polish goalkeeper keeping a clean sheet in a 1–0 win for Bournemouth. A week later, Boruc was a member of the Bournemouth side that beat Manchester United 2–1 at Dean Court.\n\nOn 17 May 2018 he signed a new contract with Bournemouth, keeping him at the club until the summer of 2019. He signed a further contract in June 2019.\n\nBoruc's debut for Poland came on 28 April 2004 in a friendly against the Republic of Ireland, coming on as second-half substitute for Jerzy Dudek, with the match ending in a goalless draw. Boruc made his first starting appearance for Poland with his third cap, a friendly on 12 July 2004 in Chicago against the United States. Boruc saved a penalty in the 11th minute from American striker Brian McBride.\n\nBoruc soon established himself as a regular in the Polish squad and was selected to the 23-men national squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup finals held in Germany. He had been battling with Tomasz Kuszczak and also Łukasz Fabiański for the starting slot, but was first-choice goalkeeper during the World Cup and played in all three of their games. Boruc was particularly outstanding in the game against Germany, although he was unable to prevent his country losing 1–0.\n\nBoruc remained first choice goalkeeper and was named in Poland's UEFA Euro 2008 squad. He played their first game against Germany and held his place through to the important second game against co-hosts Austria in which the Poles conceded a penalty in the 92nd minute to level the game. In the same match, he saved all three shots by the Austrians, leading to a final score of 1–1. He was nicknamed \"Spaceman\" by the Austrian and German press during the tournament. The famous Polish striker from the late 1970s and 1980s, Zbigniew Boniek, criticised Poland's team performance at Euro 2008 but singled out Boruc for praise, describing him as \"world class.\"\n\nBoruc incurred the wrath of manager Leo Beenhakker in August 2008 when he and two teammates went on a night out after a friendly against Ukraine in defiance of the orders of their manager. As a result, Boruc, Dariusz Dudka and Radosław Majewski were all suspended by Beenhakker for the next two internationals. Boruc, however, quickly regained his place in the team and continued to be the regular choice until falling from favour again in October 2010 under Beenhakker's successor as Poland manager, Franciszek Smuda.\n\nAfter an absence of over two years, Boruc was recalled to the Polish squad in January 2013 and played in their 0–2 defeat against the Republic of Ireland a week later on 6 February 2013. Boruc maintained his place in the international side for their next two competitive games on 22 and 26 March 2013, World Cup qualifiers against Ukraine and San Marino respectively.\n\nBoruc made 64 appearances for his country, his last appearance coming in a friendly on 14 November 2016 against Slovenia, playing the first half before being substituted at half time in a 1–1 draw. His appearance in that game saw him become the most highly capped goalkeeper for Poland, passing Jan Tomaszewski's record of 63 caps.\n\nIn March 2017, Boruc announced his retirement from international football, through his Instagram profile, citing his age, \"peace of mind\" regarding the position of a Polish goalkeeper, and focusing on his career in Bournemouth. He earned his final 65th cap at his farewell match against Uruguay on 10 November 2017 in Warsaw, being substituted shortly before half-time by former Legia Warszawa teammate, Łukasz Fabiański.\n\nBoruc was at the centre of many controversies during his Celtic tenure.\n\nOn 25 August 2006, Boruc was cautioned by the Strathclyde Police for a breach of the peace for making gestures in front of Rangers fans before a game earlier that year. According to the \"Sunday Herald\", \"police reports highlighted three hand gestures made by 26-year-old Boruc ... a V sign at the crowd, another obscene gesture at the crowd and a blessing.\" The gestures were not caught on video and the caution was issued on the basis of police reports and witness statements. This incident has led to him attaining the nickname \"The Holy Goalie\".\n\nThe Procurator Fiscal said Boruc \"was seen by members of the public and police officers to bless himself. Witnesses describe him smiling or laughing at a Rangers section of the crowd and making 'come on' gestures. This action appeared to incense a section of the crowd to react in such a way that police officers and security personnel had to become involved to calm the situation. The police reported that it took 10 minutes to restore normality in the crowd.\" According to a cross-party working group of the Scottish Parliament, \"the sign of the cross in itself is an expression of the Roman Catholic faith; however, using it to alarm, upset or provoke others might be a breach of the peace at common law.\"\n\nThe Catholic Church condemned the legal action, however, expressing regret that \"Scotland seems to have made itself one of the few countries in the world where this simple religious gesture is considered an offence.\" Following extensive press comment, the Crown Office issued a statement on 28 August 2006 stressing that the \"very limited\" action had been taken against Boruc for gestures made toward Rangers supporters rather than for crossing himself, and that it would not take action against individuals for \"acts of religious observance.\" According to BBC News Online, the caution \"brought the issue of sectarianism in Scotland back into sharp focus.\" The Roman Catholic Church welcomed the Crown Office's clarification of the limited action taken against Boruc, particularly the statement that it \"did not in any way refer to the act of blessing himself.\"\n\nOn 17 December 2006, Boruc again crossed himself during his first Old Firm game since the caution, drawing \"a roar\" from the Rangers fans behind his goal. A spokesman for Celtic defended his gesture, stating \"the police have said they have no problem with Artur Boruc in this regard and neither does Celtic Football Club.\"\n\nBoruc courted further controversy in April 2008 when he displayed a T-shirt saying \"God bless the Pope\" and bearing a picture of Pope John Paul II after a game against Rangers, and also in May 2007 when he waved a flag proclaiming Celtic the \"champions\" following a match against Rangers.\n\nBoruc is a Legia Warsaw fan and attends matches in Poland.\n\nOn 21 April 2007, he helped a 27-year-old pregnant Polish woman, her sister and brother-in-law, when they were attacked in Glasgow.\n\nBoruc's father died in April 2010; his mother Jadwiga died when he was only 20. He has a brother and three sisters. On 11 June 2008, Boruc's then-wife Katarzyna gave birth to their son, Aleksander (\"Aleks\"), in Warsaw. Boruc and his wife separated in 2008, amid reports of his relationship with former \"Polish Idol\" contestant Sara Mannei. Mannei gave birth to daughter Amelia on 9 August 2010 in Poland and the couple married in 2014.\n\nIn September 2009, \"The Scottish Sun\" published an apology, for claiming Boruc had had an affair with a young woman, shown in a photograph, who was actually his sister. In June 2011, the \"News of the World\" admitted it had published a false report on Boruc, and paid him £70,000, believed to be a record for Scottish libel cases, plus legal expenses.\n\nLegia Warsaw\n\nCeltic\n\nAFC Bournemouth\n\nIndividual\n\n"}
{"id": "1919497", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1919497", "title": "Anne Steele", "text": "Anne Steele\n\nAnne Steele (pen name, Theodosia; 171711 November 1778) was an English Baptist hymn writer and essayist. For a full century after her death, she filled a larger place in United States and British hymnals than any other woman.\n\nAt an early age, Steele showed a taste for literature, and would often entertain her friends by her poetical compositions. To a fervour of devotion, which increased as she got older, she developed a fondness for sacred literature, which led her to compose a considerable number of pieces in prose and verse. These works were published using the pseudonym, \"Theodosia\". Portions of these spiritual lyrics soon found their way into collections, while the diffidence of the authoress because of her pen name, left her comparatively unknown beyond the circle of her personal friends.\n\nIn 1760, two volumes, appeared under the title of \"Poems on Subjects chiefly Devotional, by Theodosia\". After her death, which occurred in 1778, a new edition was published with an additional volume and a Preface by the Rev. Dr. Caleb Evans of Bristol (Bristol, 1780). In the three volumes, there are 144 hymns, 34 Psalms in verse, and about 30 short poems. They were reprinted in one volume by D. Sedgwick, 1863. Steele's hymns were first made available for congregational use in 1769, 62 of them being then introduced into the Bristol Baptist \"Collections\" of Ash & Evans, the letter T for \"Theodosia\" being affixed; 47 were also given in Dr. Rippon's \"Selections\", 1787, and 26 in Dr. W. B. Collyer's \"Collections\", 1812. The original edition of \"Theodosia\"‘s works are kept in the Library of the Baptist College, Bristol.\n\nAnne (\"Nanny\") Steele was born at Broughton, Hampshire, in 1717. She was descended from a family of Puritans. Her father, William Steele, was the minister of a community of Baptists, and he himself was descended from preachers. At an early age, Steele manifested a pious disposition, and at the age of fourteen, had become a member of the church of which her father was pastor. Owing to an accident in childhood, she was always an invalid, and often confined to her chamber.\n\nSteele discovered in early life her love of the Muses, and often entertained her friends with her poetical and pious writing. But it was not without extreme reluctance that she finally submitted any of them to be read by the public. Her father's diary mentions Steele's first publication in 1757:— \"1757, Nov. 29. This day Nanny sent a part of her compositions to London to be printed.\" Again: \"Her brother brought with him her poetry, not yet bound.\" Steele's stepmother, the second Mrs. Steele, shared the father's admiration, but they were anxious that any public expression of Steele's abilities as a writer should not injure her character. They prayed that she would remain humble. It was not till she was 44 that she consented to the publication of her hymns, that they might be available for public use. \n\nIn 1760, she published \"Poems on Subjects Chiefly Devotional\" under the name \"Theodosia\". This book had a second edition (3 vols. Bristol, 1780), for which Caleb Evans wrote a preface. Her complete works were published in one volume by Daniel Sedgwick (London, 1863), as \"Hymns, Psalms, and Poems by Anne Steele\", with a memoir by John Sheppard. It comprised 144 hymns, thirty-four metrical psalms and fifty moral poems. Some of them, e.g. \"Father of mercies, in Thy word,\" have found their way into the collections of other churches. She has been called the Frances Ridley Havergal of the 18th-century. Several of Anne Steele's hymns appear in the Sacred Harp. In 1780, a new edition of the \"Poems\", comprising a third and posthumous volume of \"Miscellanies\", was published by Dr. Caleb Evans, the profits of which were to be given to the “Bristol Education Society\", also known as the Baptist College of Bristol, of which he was at that time President; to that volume, the Editor prefixed a biography of \"Mrs. Steele\", as she was more commonly called.\n\n\"A Selection of Hymns for Public Worship\", a hymn book compiled by William Gadsby and first published in 1814, includes twenty-seven of the hymns by Anne Steele. This book is used mainly by some of the Calvinistic Strict Baptist churches in England. Steele, like the Welsh poet, William Williams Pantycelyn, wrote missionary hymns before modern missionary and Bible societies were established. She also wrote a well-known Sunday school hymn before Sunday schools were established.\n\nIt has often been written that the drowning of her betrothed, Robert Elscourt, a few hours before the time fixed for her marriage, deeply affected an otherwise quiet life. However, modern research refutes the details of this story. One man did ask for the hand of Anne Steele, in 1742. This was Benjamin Beddome, but she turned him down, and remained unmarried.\n\nSteele loved the retirement of her Hampshire home. A quiet life suited her best. She said of herself:— \"I enjoy a calm evening on the terrace walk, and I wish, though in vain, for numbers sweet as the lovely prospect, and gentle as the vernal breeze, to describe the beauties of charming spring; but the reflection how soon these blooming pleasures will vanish, spreads a melancholy gloom, till the mind rises by a delightful transition to the celestial Eden—the scenes of undecaying pleasure and immutable perfection.\" She sometimes wrote hymns on creation and providence; and although these lack the powerful originality of those of classical hymnists, they were full of warm, tender, thankful feeling.\n\nAlways of a delicate constitution, it appears that Steele's habits were very reclusive. For many years, she was confined to her room because of illness, during which period, she was engaged in writing essays, principally of a religious nature, in prose and verse. In 1769, Steele's father died, and it is said that she never recovered from the shock. After the death of her father, she spent the remaining nine years of her life in the house of her brother, William, which he had built very near the old family home. Unlike most authors of her day, Steele was in a financial position which enabled her to devote the profits of her books to religious and charitable uses, and the same course was pursued by her surviving relatives.\n\nNo portrait of Steele was ever made. She died in her native village, on 11 November 1778, at the age of 62, and was interred in the family vault at Broughton Church cemetery.\n\nSteele's hymns included class religious terms, which had a charm to those familiar with them, and who belonged to the \"favoured\" class, but had an unpleasant technical character to the ordinary reader. For example, the words 'dear' and 'dearest' were used till they seemed weak, and wearied the reader.\n\nSteele's hymns, which were much used by Baptists, emphasized the less optimistic phases of Christian experience. Among Baptist hymnwriters, Steele stood at the head, if regarded either by the number of her hymns which found a place in the hymnals of the nineteenth century, or the frequency with which they were sung. Although few of them could be placed in the first rank of lyrical compositions, they were almost uniformly simple in language, natural and pleasing in imagery, and full of genuine Christian feeling. Steele may not inappropriately be compared with Frances Ridley Havergal. In both, there was the same evangelic fervour, in both the same intense personal devotion to Jesus. But whilst Steele seemed to think of Him more frequently as her \"bleeding, dying Lord \"—dwelling on His sufferings in their physical aspect, Havergal more often referred to His living help and sympathy, recognized with gladness His present claims as \"Master\" and \" King,\" and anticipated almost with ecstasy His second coming. Looking at the whole of Steele's hymns, there is a wider range of thought than in Miss Havergal's compositions. Steele treats a greater variety of subjects.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Bush and his wife Barbara move into the empty house across the street from the Simpsons and take a liking to Ned Flanders. Although Barbara takes a liking to Bart, Bart's pranks and irreverant spirit annoy George, who spanks the boy after he accidentally shreds his memoirs and trashes the house with an outboard motor. Despite Barbara's suggestion that he apologize, George refuses after Homer confronts him for spanking Bart.\n\nHomer launches bottle rockets at George's window after Bush displays a banner reading \"Two Bad Neighbors\" to refer to Bart and Homer. Homer tears down cardboard likenesses of George and Barbara's sons, George Jr. and Jeb, displayed on their porch. He also glues a rainbow-colored wig on George's head as he is about to give a speech at a local club. George retaliates by destroying the Simpsons' lawn with his car.\n\nGeorge spots Homer and Bart moving through underground sewers to release locusts in his house. He climbs below the street to confront them. After Homer and George brawl, Bart releases the locusts, which attack George. Former Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev arrives to deliver a housewarming present for the Bushes. After pressure from his wife, George reluctantly apologizes to Homer in front of Gorbachev. The Bushes eventually move and sell their house to former President Gerald Ford. Ford invites Homer for beer and nachos during a football game broadcast at his house. Homer and Gerald find they share common ground because they are both accident-prone.\n\nThe show had a feud with the Bushes that eventually led to the idea for this episode. In the October 1, 1990 edition of \"People\", Barbara Bush called \"The Simpsons\" \"the dumbest thing [she] had ever seen\", which had led to the writers sending a letter to Bush where they posed as Marge Simpson. Bush immediately sent a reply in which she apologized.\n\nOn January 27, 1992, then-President George H. W. Bush made a speech during his re-election campaign that reignited the feud between \"The Simpsons\" and the Bushes. At that point, family values were the cornerstone of Bush's campaign platform, to which effect he gave the following speech at the National Religious Broadcasters' convention in Washington, D.C.: \"We are going to keep on trying to strengthen the American family, to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons\". The next broadcast of \"The Simpsons\" was a rerun of \"Stark Raving Dad\" on January 30, 1992. It included a new opening, which was a response to Bush's speech. The scene begins in the Simpsons' living room. Homer, Bart, Lisa, and Patty and Selma all stare at the television and watch Bush's speech. After Bush's statement Bart replies, \"Hey, we're just like the Waltons. We're praying for an end to the Depression too.\"\n\nBill Oakley, who was a writer on \"The Simpsons\" at the time, came up with the idea for \"Two Bad Neighbors\" two years before production began. Oakley got the inspiration for the episode after the feud between the Bushes and the Simpson family, and two years later when he and Josh Weinstein became showrunners of \"The Simpsons\", they assigned Ken Keeler to write it. Oakley said that Bill Clinton had been President of the United States for two years at the point when the episode went into production, so the feud had \"faded off into oblivion\". The staff therefore thought it would be funny if the two parties encountered each other again.\n\nWeinstein said that the episode is often misunderstood. Many audiences expected a political satire, while the writers made special effort to keep the parody apolitical. Oakley stresses that \"it's not a political attack, it's a personal attack\", and instead of criticizing Bush for his policies, the episode instead pokes fun at his \"crotchetiness\". Oakley considered the episode to lack many \"zany\" jokes common for the show at that time, and described the episode as a companion piece to the season eight episode \"Homer's Enemy\", in that a realistic character (Frank Grimes in that case) is placed in the unrealistic \"Simpsons\" universe and juxtaposed alongside Homer, creating conflict.\n\nIn an interview with the fan site NoHomers.net, Weinstein was asked if there had been any stories that he had come up with that did not make it into the show, to which he replied: \"The great thing about \"The Simpsons\" is that we pretty much were able to get away with everything, so there weren't any episodes we really wanted to do that we couldn't do. Even the crazy high-concept ones like 'Two Bad Neighbors' and 'Homer's Enemy' we managed to put on the air because honestly there were no network execs there to stop us.\"\n\nAt the end of the episode, Gerald Ford moves into the house across the street after Bush leaves. When originally conceived, Richard Nixon was going to move in instead, though this was changed to Bob Dole following Nixon's death. The writers then decided it would be funnier if it were Ford since they believed he was the politician who best represented Homer. Keeler's first draft also included a musical number in the style of Tom Lehrer's satirical recordings, although this ended up being cut.\n\nThe episode features the first appearance of Disco Stu, who became a recurring character in the series. Stu was originally designed as a withered, old, John Travolta-esque figure and was to be voiced by repeat guest star Phil Hartman. However, when the animators remodeled the character, Hartman was not available to dub the voice and so Hank Azaria took over the role.\n\n\"Two Bad Neighbors\" originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 14, 1996. The episode was selected for release in a 2000 video collection of selected political episodes of the show, titled: \"The Simpsons Political Party\". The episode appeared on the second volume of the collection, together with the episode \"Duffless\" from season four. The episode was included in \"The Simpsons\" season seven DVD set, which was released on December 13, 2005. Keeler, Oakley, and Weinstein participated in the DVD's audio commentary, alongside Matt Groening and the director of the episode, Wes Archer.\n\nThe relationship between Bart and George is a homage to the United States television series \"Dennis the Menace\" from 1959, with the Bushes standing in for Dennis's elderly neighbors, the Wilsons. In response to George spanking Bart, Grandpa says: \"Big deal! When I was a pup, we got spanked by Presidents till the cows came home. Grover Cleveland spanked me on two non-consecutive occasions\", referring to Grover Cleveland, the only president to have served two non-consecutive terms in office. When Homer and Bart hand out fliers for the upcoming garage sale, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon is seen washing his car while singing Cheap Trick's 1979 song \"Dream Police\". Homer's song at the rummage sale is set to the tune of the songs \"Big Spender\" and \"Stayin' Alive\".\n\nIn its original broadcast, \"Two Bad Neighbors\" finished 52nd in the ratings for the week of January 7 to January 14, 1996, with a Nielsen rating of 9.9. The episode was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following the Post Game NFC Championship.\n\nSince airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from fans and television critics. It was named by \"Vanity Fair\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s John Ortved as the show's fifth best episode. Ortved said, \"While the \"Simpsons\" people have always claimed evenhandedness in their satire, the show is, after all, hardly right-leaning, and it is hard to miss how gleefully the former President is mocked here.\" Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", wrote: \"Very strange, this episode takes \"The Simpsons\" into a whole new dimension of political satire. The lampooning of a single public figure is a startling move. Works much better for Americans, we're told.\"\n\nDave Foster of DVD Times said: \"Once again showing the mischievous relationship Bart and Homer share their pranks and the inevitable confrontations with George Bush Senior are as hilarious as they are implausible and frequent, but there is much to love about this episode in which the writers think out loud and paint \"The Simpsons\" and its characters as Bush once did.\" DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson enjoyed the episode and said that it \"offers the kind of episode that only \"The Simpsons\" could pull off well. The idea of bringing a president to live in Springfield is high-concept to say the least, and it could – and probably should – have bombed. However, the silliness works well and turns this into a great show.\" John Thorpe of \"Central Michigan Life\" named it the second best episode of the series, and Rich Weir of AskMen.com named it the ninth best episode.\n\n"}

It gained worldwide attention after several operations such as the Indonesian invasion of East Timor and the release of hostages from Garuda Indonesia Flight 206.\n\nThe Special Forces spearheaded some of the government's military campaigns: putting down regional rebellions in the late 1950s, the Operation Trikora (Western New Guinea campaign) in 1961–1962, the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation from 1962–1966, the massacres of alleged communists in 1965, the East Timor invasion in 1975, and subsequent campaigns against separatists in various provinces.\n\nKopassus is reported by national and international media, human rights-affiliated NGOs and researchers to have committed violations of human rights in East Timor, Aceh, Riau and Papua and the capital Jakarta. Published articles in mainstream media may include epithets such as \"the notorious Kopassus\" or \"abusive Indonesian unit\"..\n\nOn 15 April 1952, Colonel Alexander Evert Kawilarang began to form \"Kesatuan Komando Tentara Territorium\" III/Siliwangi (Kesko TT), the early name of Kopassus and the basis for this historic special forces unit.\n\nNot long after, Colonel Kawilarang with the use of military intelligence located and met with Major Rokus Bernardus Visser—a former member of the Dutch Special Forces who had remained in newly independent Indonesia, settled in West Java, married an Indonesian woman, and was known locally as Mochammad Idjon Djanbi. He was the first recruit for the Indonesian special forces, as well as its first commander. Due to him, the unit which later became \"Kopassus\" wear red berets (color traditionally favored by airborne troops in Europe) instead of the distinctive green beret.\n\nAt that time, Indonesia's special force name was 3rd Territorial Army Command Commando Unit (Indonesian: \"Kesatuan Komando Teritorium Tiga (Kesko TT)\"). \"Kopassus\" was the final result of five name changes: KTT, KKAD (\"KK Angkatan Darat\", \"Army Commando Forces Unit\"), RPKAD, \"Puspassus\" (\"Army Special Forces Department\") and \"Kopassandha\". The first generation of this force was only around a hundred soldiers or one company, headquartered in Bandung. Among its pioneer instructors was a young veteran of the Indonesian National Revolution, future Minister of Defense Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani, who later became a battalion commander and later led his paratroopers to crush the two twin rebellions in 1957-58 by the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia and Permesta.\n\nAs the RPKAD (\"Resimen Para Komando Angkatan Darat\", \"Army Para-Commando Regiment\"),a name used in the 1960s, and expanded into a three-battalion special forces airborne regiment, the para-military force was involved in the widespread killings\nduring Gen. Suharto's rise to power. An estimated half-a million people were killed in the anti-communist purge with strong communal overtones.\n\nThe RPKAD was involved in wiping out entire villages such as Kesiman (east of Denpasar) in Bali, many of them in beach areas which later becomes major tourist resorts.\n\nThe unit also saw action during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation when in 1965, Indonesia launched a war for control of North Borneo (Sabah/Sarawak) during Malaysian independence, particularly in the Battle of Sungei Koemba. In 1981, with Moerdani yet again at the lead, a Kopassandha company was deployed to Bangkok as part of the efforts to rescue Garuda Indonesia Flight 206 from hijackers.\n\nKopassus organizational structure is different from the infantry units in general. Although Kopassus members generally came from the Infantry Corps, Kopassus created its own structure, which is different from infantry units.\n\nKopassus units intentionally do not use the nomenclature of standard infantry units. This is apparent in their units called Groups. With this unit, Kopassus can deploy a brigade plus size (about 5,000 personnel), or fewer.\n\nThere are Five (5) groups of Kopassus which are:\n\nExcept for Pusdikpassus, which serves as an educational center, other Groups have combat oriented operational functions. Each Group (except Pusdikpassus) is subdivided into battalions, for example: Yon 11, 12, 13 and 14 (from Group 1), and Yon 21, 22 and 23 (from Group 2).\nGroup 1 Para Commando (\"GRUP 1 PARA KOMANDO\") is a unit of Brigade level which is part of the Army Special Forces Command and was established on 23 March 1963. The group was first commanded by Major L.B. Moerdani. The unit's motto known as \"Dhuaja\" is Eka Wastu Baladhika, then created by Corporal Suyanto. It has a total of 3,274 personnel. The unit's internal organization consists of the group headquarters and four battalions which are:\n\nEach battalion consists of 3 companies. Each company is broken into 3 platoons, each of which consisted of 39 people. And each platoon consists of 3 small units called a squad of 10 men. The 1st Group, with its 4 battalions, is the largest brigade of the Kopassus.\n\nGroup 2 Para Commando (\"GRUP 2 PARA KOMANDO\") is a unit of Brigade level, which is part of the Special Forces Command of the Army and was established in 1962. The group was first commanded by Major Soegiarto. The unit's motto is Dwi Dharma Bhirawa Yudha and has a total of 1.459 personnel. The unit's internal organization are as follows:\n\nLike \"Group 1\", \"Group 2\" has the main tasks and responsibilities for missions such as Airborne assault, Jungle warfare, Unconventional Warfare, Counter-Insurgency, Special Reconnaissance, and Direct Action.\n\nThe Special Forces Training and Education Center or SFTEC (\"Pusat Pendidikan dan Latihan Pasukan Khusus\") abbreviated \"Pusdiklatpassus\" is the training and education center for recruits and personnel associated with and becoming to join as Commandos in the Army Special Forces Command (Kopassus). As an educational institution, \"Pusdiklatpassus\" is divided based on its training function. Supervises nine schools of education and training including:\nIt provides other specialist courses, which are also open to members of the Army out of Kopassus such as: Hunting Company, Scuba, Rock-climbing, Demolition, Path-Finder and Sniper.\n\nThe Commando education and training lasts for approximately seven months (28 weeks) which is divided into three stages. The first phase of the implementation of the education is conducted on the base for 18 weeks, the second stage all participants will be released in the forest and the mountains twice each for 6 weeks, and the next stage of the third stage ends with a 4-week sea-swamp stage. The 97th batch of the Commando Education had first initial participants as many as 251 personnel, who successfully passed through commando education and inaugurated as a special forces commando of 214 personnel. Phases are as shown below:\n\n10 Weeks with individual ability points in Batujajar. Establish attitudes & personality, fill in technical skills, Command Operation tactics, Individual & basic capabilities of urban battle, Support knowledge, Field managerial, and individual ability test.\n\n6 Weeks with GLG emphasis, Jungle warfare and Raid warfare in Situ Lembang. Stabilization of forest observations, individual abilities in the forest / Basic battle techniques, forest capabilities in group relations, forest HTF, and durability of long march application (PPJJ).\n\n4 Weeks with heavy Commando operation tactics, sea battle tactics in Cilacap and Nusakambangan. Conservation observation of Sea-swamp, patrol ability, swamp terrain knowledge and CAMP endurance test.\n\n\"Kopassus\" has graduated students from the Commando Education (Dikko) up to 100 batches. In the year 2016 followed by 153 commando students, which consists of ranks of 41 Officers, 101 NCOs, and 11 Enlisted. The command officers who successfully complete the 7-month Command Course well are entitled to wear the qualified commando brevet issued to their clothing/uniform.\n\nAside from Kopassus commandos, the SFTEC also trains SF-ready combat personnel of the Army Raider Infantry battalions within the structure of the territorial region commands or KODAMs Army-wide and within Kostrad compotent units.\n\nGroup 3 / Sandhi Yudha is a Kopassus unit that has the specification of \"Clandestine operation\" 'secret warfare', including combat Intel and counter-insurgency. Group 3 was formed on 24 July 1967, headquartered at Cijantung Kopassus Headquarters, East Jakarta. Prospective Personnel in this Group are strictly selected internally ranging from prospective soldiers who are still educated to personnel who have active duty in unity but have an intelligence talent that will then be trained again. The motto of this unit is \"Chatur Kottaman Wira Naraca Byuha\". The Group is organized as follows:\n\nThe basic training is the same as other Kopassus soldiers (2.5 months), Command School (7 months) plus other courses such as PH (Jungle Warfare), PJD (Close Combat), Spursus (Special combat school )and Dakibu (Climber,) but after that the candidates of combat-intelligence is educated more specifically for the education of \"Sandhi Yudha\" in \"Pusdiklatassus\" located in Batujajar whose education materials are intelligence and supporting knowledge for intelligence in the field of operation such as disguise, navigation, special martial, Special tools of intelligence and others. Even some selected personnel from this Group are sent abroad to schools of Military Intelligence Education Centers such as in the United States, Germany, Britain and even Israel. Among all types of soldiers in \"Kopassus\", the most specific form of education and training is the Group 3 / Sandhi Yudha combat intelligence unit.\n\nUnit 81 / Counter Terror or abbreviated as Sat-81 / Gultor is a unit in Kopassus which is equvalent to a group level formation and is composed of the best chosen personnel within the whole of the Indonesian Army special forces. The strength of this unit is not publicly publicized on the number of personnel or types of weapons. The Sat 81 gultor is incorporated in the BNPT Crisis Control Center (\"Pusdalsis\") which consists of a combination of special units, such as the Denjaka from the Indonesian Navy, the Bravo Detachment 90 of the Indonesian Air Force, and the 1st Gegana Command of the Brimob Corps, Indonesian National Police. \"Pusdalsis\" is organized of a combination of elite units within the Indonesian National Armed Forces and Police which is assigned as a counter-terrorist formation to be sent when the activities of terrorism may be conducted such as aircraft hijacking. Special Battalions under this unit are:\n\nRecruitment is done by choosing from members which at least have 2 years of active service in the groups of the Kopassus organization.\n\nKopassus participates in bilateral training exercises with international partners. After resuming military ties in 2003, Australia's special operations unit, the Special Air Service Regiment, conducts an annual counter terrorism exercise, with Australia and Indonesia taking turns to host the event.\n\nIn July 2011, Kopassus and Chinese special forces held a joint counter terrorism exercise called Exercise Sharp Knife, held in Bandung, Java. In 2012, the same exercise was held in Jinan, Shandong province, in July.\n\nIn 2015,Kopassus and South Korea 707th Special Mission Battalion held a joint counter terorrism exercise in South Korea.\n\nIn 19 February 2018,Kopassus and 9th Para (Special Forces) held a joint exercise called Garuda Sakti in Cipatat,Bandung.\n\nIn 7 February 2019,Kopassus and Special Service Group held a joint counter terorrism exercise called Elang Strike in Pabbi,Pakistan.\n\nFormer Secretary of Defense Ryamizard Ryacudu and Acting Secretary of the Defense Secretary of the United States or Acting Secretary of Defense of the USA, H.E.Patrick M. Shanahan. agreed to conduct joint combat medic training between united state special forces and Kopassuss unit 81 in 2020\n\nThe Kopassus (then RPKAD) red beret was first used in 1954-1968 and was designed by Lieutenant Dodo Sukamto. It was first used during a ceremony on 5 October 1954. This emblem consists of a bayonet, anchors representing abilities in the sea and wings as high mobility. The beret emblem used in 1968 until now with slight changes from the initial design, the bayonet is more slender than the Commando knife and the wingspan is more wing coat like the Wing of the Army designs. The iconic Kopassus Camouflage pattern called \"Loreng Darah Mengalir\" (Flowing Blood pattern), introduced in 1964 pattern was originally intended to be a copy of the WW2 era British Denison brushstroke camouflage for issue to the RPKAD. However, an error at the original manufacturing plant resulted in the vertical, vine-like stripes that characterize this unique pattern.The original version illustrated, with some variation in color and type of fabric, saw service between 1964 and 1986 (at which time the entire Armed Forces were outfitted in a copy of British DPM). The second pattern shown was revived for issue to Kopassus in 1995 but in a slightly varied design, worn for ceremonial & training purposes only. For other purpose regular TNI patern (DPM) was used instead.\n\nThe Commando qualification brevet used since 1966 until now was designed by Major Djajadiningrat. This brevet is used by all graduates of Commando training and Education from Batujajar. Colonel Sarwo Edhie Wibowo in a demonstration of \"Show Of Force\" at Senayan's parking lot on 4 January 1966 used the new Commando Brevet qualification to show the public of the Corps' new appearance.\n\nJump Master Wings are issued to commandos of Kopassus who have graduated from advanced paratrooper jump master courses conducted by the Commando training and educational center.\n\nThe Kopassus (RPKAD) military freefall wing insignia, designed by HH.Djajadiningrat and first issued in 1962 depicts a free fall paratrooper hanging under a circle consisting of small parachutes. Stated by the first free fall instructors of the Yugoslavia: Mladen Milicetic, Stoyan Jovic and Dobel Stanej in Bandung during the first free fall graduation ceremony of Kopassus (RPKAD) on 26 October 1962.\n\nKopassus has been accused by NGOs, Western politicians, and researchers of human rights violations. Amnesty International and Indonesian human rights groups including the official National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM) have cited abuses by members of Kopassus.\n\nKopassus has also been associated with illegal economic activities, like involvement in the trade of Agarwood and illegal gold mining in West Papua and other areas, and the trade in drugs.\n\nIn 1975, five Australian journalists, known as the Balibo Five, were killed by members of Kopassus in the town of Balibo during the Indonesian invasion of East Timor. The Indonesian military has always maintained that the men were killed in a cross-fire during the battle for the town.\n\nDuring the May 1998 riots of Indonesia, Kopassus members were involved in organising and carrying out acts of murder and violence against Chinese Indonesians. This included involvement in mass gang-rapes of Sino-Indonesian women and girls across Jakarta. Kopassus has also been considered responsible for the 1997–98 activists kidnappings in Indonesia. According to the Federation of American Scientists, a number of activists were kidnapped by KOPASSUS troops in the last months of the Suharto regime, and at least 23 government critics disappeared.\n\nIn 2001, four Kopassus members were convicted of the strangulation of Theys Eluay, the former chairman of the Papua Presidium Council. They were part of a group which had killed Theys after ambushing him and his driver. The group's leader, Lt-Col Hatono, and another soldier received prison sentences of three and a half years while two others received three years. A further two officers had their charges dismissed. The men were all Kopassus members from Group V (Jakarta) and were not based in Jayapura or West Papua. They faced a court-martial, which found them not guilty on the more serious charges of premeditated murder, because the Kopassus are legally exempt from the jurisdiction of civil law. Indonesian Army Chief, General Ryamizard Ryacudu (2002–05), accepted the men had to be prosecuted \"because Indonesia is a State based on law\" but he affirmed their defence's view that they were heroes who had killed a rebel leader.\n\nSome international partners have severed military ties with Kopassus in response to allegations of human rights abuses. For example, Australia ceased training with Kopassus in 1999 in relation to Kopassus' role in violence in East Timor.\n\nIn September 2015, General Mulyono, the Army chief of staff, stated that \"There are still soldiers from the Indonesian Army who taint the name of their force and the Army with their arrogant and selfish attitudes by engaging in misdeeds or even acting against the law\", which according to the \"Jakarta Globe\" newspaper was a reference to actions by Kopassus members. Examples include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1919517", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1919517", "title": "Golden Venture", "text": "Golden Venture\n\nGolden Venture was a cargo ship that smuggled 286 illegal aliens from China (mostly Fuzhou people from Fujian province) along with 13 crew members that ran aground on the beach at Fort Tilden on the Rockaway peninsula of Queens, New York on June 6, 1993, at around 2 a.m. The ship had sailed from Bangkok, Thailand, stopped in Kenya and rounded the Cape of Good Hope, then headed northwest across the Atlantic Ocean to New York City on its four-month voyage. Ten people drowned in their attempts to flee the ship that had run aground and get to shore in the United States.\n\nThe survivors were taken into custody by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and were held in various prisons throughout the U.S. while they applied for the right of asylum. Roughly 10% were granted asylum after U.S. Representative William Goodling entreated President Bill Clinton; minors were released, while about half the remainder were deported (some being accepted by South American countries). Some remained in immigration prison for years fighting their cases, the majority in York, Pennsylvania. The final 52 persons were released by President Clinton on February 27, 1997, after four years in prison.\n\nThis case was an early test of the system of detaining asylum-seekers in prisons, a practice that continues in the U.S., Australia, and the United Kingdom. It was also notable because some detainees created more than 10,000 folk art sculptures or Chinese paper folding, papier-mâché, and recycled materials while in York County Prison; these were later exhibited throughout the U.S. and sold to offset legal costs. \n\nThe immigrants paid $40,000 on average in whole or in part before departing China on foot through Myanmar then to Bangkok where they were kept in a staging house for two months. In February 1993, the ship departed, and on its way stopped by Mombasa, Kenya to pick up passengers left stranded by a previous boat that had run aground there. Rounding the Cape of Good Hope, the ship was caught in a hurricane but survived, and headed toward Boston.\n\nThe immigrants held in the cramped hold of the freighter were forced to live on a diet of rice, peanuts, dirty water, and spoiled food as it sailed on its 4-month voyage to New York City. There were beatings by the gang enforcers on board and several incidents of rape.\n\nThe ship was supposed to rendezvous with smaller ships before landing. However, this didn't happen due to the gang in charge being arrested around that time. The smugglers onboard directed the ship to New York City. \"Golden Venture\" ran aground on the beach at Fort Tilden in Rockaway Beach in Queens, New York on June 6, 1993, at around 2 a.m. after a mutiny of sorts by one smuggler who had locked up the captain. Ten people drowned in the city early morning water in their attempts to flee the stranded ship and in their excitement get to shore in the United States.\n\nThe survivors, 262 men, 24 women, and 14 children, were taken into custody by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)--six escaped—and were held in various prisons throughout the U.S. while they applied for the right of asylum. Roughly 10 percent were granted asylum after Pennsylvania congressman William Goodling entreated President Bill Clinton; minors were released, while about half the remainder were deported (some being accepted by South American countries). Some remained in immigration prison for years fighting their cases, 119 in York, Pennsylvania in a medium security prison. It was argued that this tactic was a method of isolating the prisoners from lawyers and rights groups. A number of individuals in York volunteered their time as legal aid, and in the last years there was a weekly vigil held outside the prison.\n\nLee Peng Fei, also known as Lee Hsiao Kuang and Char Lee was described at his trial as the 'mastermind' behind \"Golden Venture\". He had not been onboard the ship but had ordered the grounding from his Chinatown apartment. The Taiwan citizen was arrested in Thailand and later sentence to 20 years.\n\nOne of those behind \"Golden Venture\" was a Chinese gang leader named Guo Liang Chi, known mainly by his street name of Ah Kay. He was the leader of the Fuk Ching gang, which up to early 1993, had been the most powerful Asian gang in New York City. A Chinese gangster who smuggled people to other countries, or a snakehead, he was also a cold-blooded gangster who tortured and killed numerous people throughout his career. Kay was arrested in Hong Kong and eventually extradited to the U.S. Federal investigators acknowledged that they were less interested in prosecuting Guo than in hearing what he had to say. After he cooperated with the US government in at least 15 different federal criminal cases over a period of many years, including the prosecution of 35 Chinatown gang members, he eventually received a light sentence.\n\nBy contrast, on June 22, 2005 Cheng Chui Ping (known within some communities as \"Sister Ping\" or \"Big Sister Ping\") was convicted for smuggling illegal immigrants and for money laundering from this case. Ah Kay testified against her during her May–June 2005 trial. Cheng became a snakehead, primarily as an investor, charging up to per person for the voyage from Asia to New York City in the suffocating hold of the rogue vessel. Although Cheng provided cash to buy the aging vessel in Thailand, trial evidence showed that she did not view \"Golden Venture\"'s voyage as an important business deal, even though the gross take for all involved would have been around $8.5 million – if all of the immigrants aboard had paid or been ransomed by their families. She owned restaurants, a clothing store, real estate in Chinatown, apartments in Hong Kong, and a farm in South Africa. Evidence revealed that her main, multimillion-dollar business was an underground banking network that stretched from New York to Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong, and China. On March 17, 2006, she was sentenced to the maximum of 35 years in federal prison despite her protests that she was forced to carry out the work by Triad gangs. The federal judge pointed out the inhumane travel conditions forced on the immigrants and her use of gangsters to collect debts and ransoms in justifying the sentence.\n\nRenamed United Caribbean and used for a while as a cargo vessel in the Caribbean, the ship was later purchased by Palm Beach County for $60,000 and deliberately sunk August 22, 2000 as an artificial reef in 70 feet of water about one mile off the south coast of Florida near Boca Raton Inlet. The ship, which had been built in 1969, became part of the Palm Beach Artificial Reef Program.

He was trained in Argos and then worked in Athens at the time of the Peloponnesian war, as a follower of the idealistic portraiture of Myron. He is best known for his statue Pericles with the Corinthian helmet.\n\nKresilas hailed from the city-state of Kydonia, on the island of Crete. He was trained in Argos as a student of Dorotheos, with whom he worked at Delphi and Hermione. Between 450 and 420 BC he worked mainly in Athens, as a follower of Myron's school and in the post-Phidias period he brought elements of compactness due to the Peloponnesian period.\n\nRoman writer Pliny the Elder wrote of a competition between the four sculptors Polykleitos, Phidias, Kresilas, and Phradmon, on the best statues of Amazons for the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus. Each sculptor placed himself at first place, but Phidias, Kresilas, and Phradmon had all put Polykleitos at second place, thus, Polykleitos won, Pheidias came second, and Kresilas third.\n\nIn Athens he created, for example, a bronze statue of Pericles (440–430 BC) with the Corinthian helmet upon the head as a sign of his position as strategos. Pliny the Elder said of it: \"a work worthy of the title; it is a marvellous thing about this art that it can make famous men even more famous\". Its base was found in the Athenian Acropolis; it was doubtless the bronze that Pausanias saw there (Pausanias I.25.1, I.28.2). It seems the series of Pericles portrait busts derive from it, of which there are examples at the Vatican Museums, British Museum (found at Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli, and owned by Charles Townley) and Altes Museum.\n\nKresilas also created the wounded men and a dying Amazon for Ephesus in concurrence (in a competition with Phidias and Polykleitos), possibly the model for many copies, one of which is the wounded Amazon of Kresilas (volnerata; Pliny, Nat. Hist. xxxiv. 75) in the Vatican Museums. He has also been identified as the originator of the Velletri type of Athena statue (\"Athena of Velletri\"). He created a Diomedes statue according to Homer's description.\n\nIn 1804 CE, Kresilas was mistakenly identified as a woman named \"Cresilla\" by Matilda Betham, who thought \"she\" had placed third behind Polykleitos and Phidias in a competition to sculpt seven Amazons for the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus. As a result, Kresilas was mistakenly included in artist Judy Chicago's symbolic history of women in Western civilization, \"The Dinner Party\".\n\n\n"}

The first king from the House of Eric was Eric IX of Sweden, also known as Saint Eric, from whom it got its name. Almost all the subsequent kings of Sweden have been descendants of the House of Eric.\n\nThe House of Eric favored the Varnhem Abbey, and several of its members are interred there.\n\nForemother of the dynasty was Eric IX's wife Christina Björnsdotter, whom legend claims to have been the maternal granddaughter of King Inge I of Sweden, who abolished paganism.\n\nThe female first name Catherine seems to have been favored within the Erik dynasty.\n\nTwo branches of the dynasty came into conflict in 1226. Canute the Tall, allegedly the adult heir of Filip, younger son of Eric IX, deposed the underage Eric XI, the Lisp and Lame (\"läspe och halte\"), who resumed the kingship in 1234. Conflict continued between the royal senior branch and Canute's two sons until the sons were executed in 1248 and 1251.\n\nEric XI was the last king of the agnatic line of this dynasty. He died in 1250 and apparently left no surviving children. Though some romantic genealogies, and later research influenced by them, have attributed one or two daughters to him, they were more likely daughters of his sister and Birger jarl. Eric XI's nephew, the then underage son of his sister Ingeborg, was elected king Valdemar I of Sweden, under the regency of his father Birger Jarl.\n\nDescent from this house was regarded as such hard currency in medieval and early modern power games that some aspirants (most notably Charles VIII of Sweden) even fabricated a descent (see Tofta, Adelsö) to show that they too were heirs of the House of Erik.\n\n"}

Her younger brother, Thomas Nesbitt, Jr., acted in one film in 1925, before his death in South Africa in 1927 from an apparent heart attack.\n\nShe made her debut in London in the stage revival of Arthur Wing Pinero's \"The Cabinet Minister\" (1910). She acted in countless plays after that. In 1911, she joined the Irish Players, went to the United States and debuted on Broadway in \"The Well of the Saints\". She also was in the cast of John Millington Synge's \"The Playboy of the Western World\" with the Irish Players when the whole cast was pelted with fruits and vegetables by the offended Irish American Catholic audience. She became the love of English poet Rupert Brooke in 1912. Brooke wrote love sonnets to her, and they were engaged to be married when he died during World War I.\n\nNesbitt returned to the US and appeared on Broadway in \"Quinneys\" (1915) and John Galsworthy's \"Justice\" (1916) as John Barrymore's leading lady in his first dramatic stage role. After five other plays there, she returned to England. For the rest of the decade she performed in London; her roles included the title role in a revival of John Webster's \"The Duchess of Malfi\". Her film debut was in the silent \"A Star Over Night\" (1919). She then performed in \"The Faithful Heart\" (1922). She did not appear in a film again until 1930, when she played the role of Anne Lymes in \"Canaries Sometimes Sing\", which was an early talkie. In 1932, she appeared in \"The Frightened Lady\". She appeared in the 1938 film version of \"Pygmalion\" as \"a lady\" who attends the Embassy ball. In the opening credits her first name was spelled as \"Kathleen\", but as \"Cathleen\" at the end of the film. She played the part of Mother in the 1949 BBC TV remake of the drama film \"Elizabeth of Ladymead\".\n\nNesbitt's first Hollywood film was \"Three Coins in the Fountain\" (1954), in which she played the character role of La Principessa. This was followed that same year by \"Black Widow\", in which she played Lucia Colletti. She was Cary Grant's Grandmother Janou in 1957's \"An Affair to Remember\" (though she was, in fact, only 16 years older than Grant) and, the following year, was part of the ensemble cast of \"Separate Tables\". She also appeared in \"The Parent Trap\" (1961), and \"Promise Her Anything\" (1965).\nOther Broadway appearances included Aunt Alicia in the original Anita Loos adaptation of \"Gigi\" (1951), \"Sabrina Fair\" (1953), and \"Anastasia\" (1954). In 1956, she played Mrs. Higgins in \"My Fair Lady\" starring Rex Harrison. Nesbitt reprised the role in 1981, in her 90s, in a Broadway revival, opposite Harrison, who was in his 70s.\n\nShe played Agatha Morley on the TV series \"The Farmer's Daughter\" from 1963 to 1966, playing the mother of a Congressman (played by William Windom). She guest starred on such shows as \"The United States Steel Hour\"; \"Wagon Train\"; \"Naked City\", \"Dr. Kildare\" and \"Upstairs, Downstairs\" (as Rachel Gurney's mother, Mabel, Countess of Southwold).\n\nIn 1969 she played Richard Burton's mother in the film \"Staircase\" and again in \"Villain\" two years later. She had a small but memorable role as an elderly drug addict in \"French Connection II\" (1975) alongside Gene Hackman. Her next film was Hitchcock's \"Family Plot\" (1976), in which she played Julia Rainbird. She then appeared as the grandmother in \"Julia\" (1977). Her final film was \"Never Never Land\" (1980) as Edith Forbes.\n\nShe was the subject of \"This Is Your Life\" in 1980 when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews.\n\nNesbitt became the love of English poet Rupert Brooke in 1912, who wrote love sonnets to her. They were engaged to be married, but he died in 1915 at age 27 of blood poisoning, the result of a bite from an infected mosquito while he served in the Royal Navy during World War I.\n\nIn 1921 Nesbitt married World War I Military Cross-winner and barrister turned actor Cecil Ramage. They had two children. She and Ramage were separated for many years but remained legally married until her death in 1982.\n\nNesbitt lived for many years in the United States, but returned to the United Kingdom where she was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1978. Her autobiography, \"A Little Love and Good Company\", was published in 1973.

In June of the same year, the former Prime-Minister, Mário Soares, had resigned from the job due to the lack of parliamentary support, the government was composed by a coalition of the two major parties, the center-right Social Democratic and the center-left Socialist, in what was called the \"Central Bloc\", however this was an unstable balance of forces and several members of each party opposed such alliance.\n\nThe new leader of the Social Democratic Party, Cavaco Silva, elected in May, was among those that never supported such alliance, and short after being elected leader of the party made the coalition fall in July.\n\nA new election was called by the President and the Social Democrats won with a short majority and Cavaco became the Prime-Minister. The election was the first of three consecutive election victories for the Social Democratic Party. Meanwhile, a new party had been founded by supporters of the President Ramalho Eanes, the Democratic Renewal Party, led by Hermínio Martinho that surprisingly gained 45 MPs and more than one million votes in the election and became the parliamentary support of the Cavaco's government until 1987, when it removed its support, making Cavaco fall.\n\nThe Communists and the Socialists lost votes and MPs, and the left would only return to the government ten years later, in 1995.\n\nThe Assembly of the Republic has 250 members elected to four-year terms.

{"id": "1919541", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1919541", "title": "Henry Suso", "text": "Henry Suso\n\nHenry Suso (also called Amandus, a name adopted in his writings, and Heinrich Seuse in German), was a German Dominican friar and the most popular vernacular writer of the fourteenth century (when considering the number of surviving manuscripts). Suso is thought to have been born on March 21, 1295. An important author in both Latin and Middle High German, he is also notable for defending Meister Eckhart's legacy after Eckhart was posthumously condemned for heresy in 1329. He died in Ulm on 25 January 1366, and was beatified by the Catholic Church in 1831.\n\nSuso was born Heinrich von Berg, a member of the ruling family of Berg. He was born in either the Free imperial city of Überlingen on Lake Constance or nearby Constance, on 21 March 1295 (or perhaps on that date up to 1297-9). Later, out of humility and devotion to his mother, he took her family name, which was Sus (or Süs). At 13 years of age he was admitted to the novitiate of the Dominican Order at their priory in Constance. After completing that year of probation, he advanced to do his preparatory, philosophical, and theological studies there.\n\nIn the prologue to his \"Life\", Suso recounts how, after about five years in the monastery (in other words, when he was about 18 years old), he experienced a conversion to a deeper form of religious life through the intervention of Divine Wisdom. He made himself \"the Servant of Eternal Wisdom\", which he identified with the divine essence and, in more specific terms, with divine Eternal Wisdom made man in Christ. From this point forward in his account of his spiritual life, a burning love for Eternal Wisdom dominated his thoughts and controlled his actions; his spiritual journey culminated in a mystical marriage to Christ in the form of the Eternal Wisdom.\n\nSuso was then sent on for further studies in philosophy and theology, probably first at the Dominican monastery in Strasbourg, perhaps between 1319 and 1321, and then from 1324 to 1327 he took a supplementary course in theology in the Dominican \"Studium Generale\" in Cologne, where he would have come into contact with Meister Eckhart, and probably also Johannes Tauler, both celebrated mystics.\n\nReturning to his home priory at Constance in about 1327, Suso was appointed to the office of \"lector\" (lecturer). His teaching, however, aroused criticism – most likely because of his connection with Eckhart in the wake of the latter's trial and condemnation in 1326-9. Suso's \"Little Book of Truth\", a short defence of Eckhart's teaching, probably dates from this time, perhaps 1329. In 1330 this treatise, and another, were denounced as heretical by enemies in the Order. Suso traveled to the Dominican General Chapter held at Maastricht in 1330 to defend himself. The consequence is not entirely known – at some point between 1329 and 1334 he was removed from his lectorship in Constance, though he was not personally condemned.\n\nKnowledge of Suso's activities in subsequent years is somewhat sketchy. It is known that he served as prior of the Constance convent – most likely between 1330 and 1334, though possibly in the 1340s. It is also known that he had various devoted disciples, a group including both men and women, especially those connected to the \"Friends of God\" movement. His influence was especially strong in many religious communities of women, particularly in the Dominican Monastery of St. Katharinental in the Argau, a famous nursery of mysticism in the 13th and 14th centuries. In the mid-1330s, during his visits to various communities of Dominican nuns and Beguines, Suso became acquainted with Elsbeth Stagel, prioress of the monastery of Dominican nuns in Töss. The two became close friends. She translated some of his Latin writings into German, collected and preserved most of his extant letters, and at some point began gathering the materials that Suso eventually put together into his \"Life of the Servant\".\n\nSuso shared in the exile of the Dominican community from Constance between 1339 and 1346, during the most heated years of the quarrel between Pope John XXII and the Holy Roman Emperor. He was transferred to the monastery at Ulm in about 1348. He seems to have remained there for the rest of his life. Here, during his final years (possibly 1361-3), he edited his four vernacular works into \"The Exemplar\".\n\nSuso died in Ulm on 25 January 1366.\n\nEarly in his life, Suso subjected himself to extreme forms of mortifications; later on he reported that God told him they were unnecessary. During this period, Suso devised for himself several painful devices. Some of these were: an undergarment studded with a hundred and fifty brass nails, a very uncomfortable door to sleep on, and a cross with thirty protruding needles and nails under his body as he slept. In the autobiographical text in which he reports these, however, he ultimately concludes that they are unnecessary distractions from the love of God.\n\nSuso and Johannes Tauler were students of Meister Eckhart, forming the nucleus of the Rhineland school of mysticism. As a lyric poet and \"troubadour of divine wisdom,\" Suso explored with psychological intensity the spiritual truths of Eckhart’s mystical philosophy.\n\nSuso's first work was the \"Büchlein der Wahrheit\" (\"Little Book of Truth\") written between 1328 and 1334 in Constance. This was a short defence of the teaching of Meister Eckhart, who had been tried for heresy and condemned in 1328-9. In 1330 this treatise and another (possibly the \"Little Book of Eternal Wisdom\") were denounced as heretical by Dominican opponents, leading Suso to travel to the Dominican General Chapter held at Maastricht in 1330 to defend himself.\n\nSuso's next book, \"Das Büchlein der ewigen Weisheit\" (\"The Little Book of Eternal Wisdom\"), written around 1328-1330, is less speculative and more practical. At some point between 1334 and 1337 Suso translated this work into Latin, but in doing so added considerably to its contents, and made of it an almost entirely new book, which he called the \"Horologium Sapientiae\" (\"Clock of Wisdom\"). This book was dedicated to the new Dominican Master General, Hugh of Vaucemain, who appears to have been a supporter of his.\n\nAt some point in the following decades, Stagel formed a collection of 28 of Suso's letters in the \"Grosses Briefbuch\" (\"Great Book of Letters\"), which survives. Suso also wrote a long text purporting to tell the story of his spiritual life and ascetic practices (variously referred to as the \"Life of the Servant\", \"Life\", \"Vita\", or \"Leben Seuses\"), and revised the \"Büchlein der Wahrheit\" and the \"Büchlein der ewigen Weisheit\". At some point in his later years, perhaps 1361-3, he collected these works, together with 11 of his letters (the \"Briefbüchlein\", or \"Little Book of Letters\", a selection of letters from the \"Grosses Briefbuch\"), and wrote a prologue, to form one book he referred to as \"The Exemplar\".\n\nThere are also various sermons attributed to Suso, although only two appear to be authentic. A treatise known as the \"Minnebüchlein\" (\"Little Book of Love\") is sometimes, but probably incorrectly, attributed to Suso.\n\nSuso was very widely read in the later Middle Ages. There are 232 extant manuscripts of the Middle High German \"Little Book of Eternal Wisdom\". The Latin \"Clock of Wisdom\" was even more popular: over four hundred manuscripts in Latin, and over two hundred manuscripts in various medieval translations (it was translated into eight languages, including Dutch, French, Italian, Swedish, Czech, and English). Many early printings survive as well. The \"Clock\" was therefore second only to the \"Imitation of Christ\" in popularity among spiritual writings of the later Middle Ages. Among his many readers and admirers were Thomas à Kempis and John Fisher.\n\nWolfgang Wackernagel and others have called Suso a \"Minnesinger in prose and in the spiritual order\" or a \"Minnesinger of the Love of God\" both for his use of images and themes from secular, courtly, romantic poetry and for his rich musical vocabulary. The mutual love of God and man which is his principal theme gives warmth and color to his style. He used the full and flexible Alemannic idiom with rare skill, and contributed much to the formation of good German prose, especially by giving new shades of meaning to words employed to describe inner sensations.\n\nIn the world Suso was esteemed as a preacher, and was heard in the cities and towns of Swabia, Switzerland, Alsace, and the Netherlands. His apostolate, however, was not with the masses, but rather with individuals of all classes who were drawn to him by his singularly attractive personality, and to whom he became a personal director in the spiritual life.\n\nSuso was reported to have established among the \"Friends of God\" a society which he called the \"Brotherhood of the Eternal Wisdom\". The so-called \"Rule of the Brotherhood of the Eternal Wisdom\" is but a free translation of a chapter of his \"Horologium Sapientiae,\" and did not make its appearance until the fifteenth century.\n\nSuso was beatified in 1831 by Pope Gregory XVI, who assigned 2 March as his feast day, celebrated within the Dominican Order. The Dominicans now celebrate his feast on 23 January, the \"feria\", or \"free\" day, nearest the day of his death.\n\nThe words of the Christmas song In dulci jubilo are attributed to Suso.\n\n\"The Exemplar\" (Middle High German):\n(translated by Frank Tobin, in \"The Exemplar, with Two German Sermons\", New York: Paulist Press, 1989, pp. 61–204)\n(trans. in F.

Dejazmach Tedla's death had caused a rebellion in Wollo. Nearly a century prior to the reign of Tekle Giyorgis II, Emperor Iyasu I's great-granddaughter, Princess Yeworqweha, had been married to Dejazmach Wand Bewossen, a renowned 18th-century warlord and ruling Zemene Mesafint prince who nearly established full control of the Ethiopian Empire and governed the provinces of Lasta and Begemeder until he died in battle in 1777. Their son and heir, Prince Ras Hailu Wand Bewossen, the successor of his father Wand Bewossen and sovereign of Lasta, of the Gondarine Solomonic bloodline, and father of the Gondar-Lasta House of the Solomonic dynasty, begot Princess Ayichesh's father, Dejazmach Tedla Hailu. \n\nPrincess Ayichesh was also the paternal grandmother of Leul Ras Kassa Haile Darge. Leul Ras Kassa's father, Dejazmach Hailu, was her younger son and the half brother of Tekle Giyorgis II to whom she had given birth from a remarriage with an influential Lasta Ecclesiastic and nobleman, Dejazmach Megabe Woldekiros, after the demise of her husband, the then-King of Wag province, and father of Tekle Giyorgis II, Wagshum Gebremedhin. Tekle Giyorgis II's uncles, the sons of Dejazmach Tedla Hailu, played significant roles as members of the Gondar-Lasta Imperial House, brothers of his mother, whom he referred to as his brothers in surviving Imperial letters. They interceded as high Imperial officials and his generals during his rise to the throne and throughout his three-year-reign until his fall. Prince Ras Meshesha Tedla is known to have ruled Wag province, and Dejazmach Serawit Tedla, Dejazmach Yimam Tedla, Dejazmach Yesufe Tedla, Dejazmach Yimer Tedla were notable princes of the Gondar-Lasta Solomonic bloodline of Emperors Fasilides, Yohannes I, and Iyasu I. Dejazmach Yimer Tedla fathered Princess Menen Yimer, the maternal ancestress of Lij Tedla Melaku, a philosopher, historian, author, and Abyssinian royalist.\n\nEmperor Tekle Giorgis II's principal rivals for sole rule were Menelik II (who was at the time king of Shewa), and Dejazmach Kassai (the future Emperor Yohannes IV). Tekle Giyorgis II married the sister of the latter, Dinqinesh Mercha. Despite that Tekle Giyorgis ruled Ethiopia for over three years, some lists of the Emperors of Ethiopia omit his name. In Ethiopia today, little is known of him, in contrast to his celebrated predecessor and successor, Yohannes IV. \n\nGobeze, prior to his enthronement as Tekle Giyorgis II, enters the historical record when he raised the banner of rebellion in Lasta in 1864, six years after his father Wagshum Gebre Medhin had been executed by Emperor Tewodros II for accusations of supporting the rebel Agew Niguse.\n\nGobeze made his opening move even before the suicide of Emperor Tewodros II at the end of the British Expedition to Ethiopia. Towards the end of 1867, he began to march on Tewodros' fortress at Maqdala, but stopped about away then turned to fight Tiso Gobeze, who had revolted against Tewodros and had control of Begemder. Tiso was killed in battle at Qwila. In August 1868, Wagshum Gobeze was proclaimed Emperor Tekle Giyorgis II of Ethiopia at Soqota in his district of Wag and crowned at Debre Zebit, where his father had been executed. Because \"Abuna\" Salama, head of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church died in October 1867, he was crowned by the Ethiopian Echege (እጨጌ), the principal head and Abun of all monasteries and churches of the land.\n\nDonald Crummey comments on Gobeze's motivation for adopting \"Tekle Giyorgis\" as his regnal name \"was unmistakable, and would have been clear to each peasant, let alone the learned. The previous ruler of that throne name had reigned off and on during the last two decades of the 18th century and had entered tradition with the nickname \"Fatsame Mangest\", 'Ender of the Kingdom', or, very loosely, 'Last of the Line'\". Tekle Giyorgis II linked himself to the last independent Emperors of the Gondar line through his mother. In addition, Tekle Giyorgis sought the support of the Ethiopian Church, which had been alienated by Tewodros' behavior, by restoring to the churches of Gondar the lands his predecessor had taken away, gave them generous quantities of equipment, and arranged for a special burial and commemoration for \"Abuna\" Salama. Crummey quotes the words of the chronicler, \"After Fasil there was no one who did for Gondar as \"Ase\" Takla Giyorgis did.\" \n\nDiplomatic appeals to Tekle Giyorgis' rivals failed to gain their acknowledgment of his new rank, although none of them were secure enough in their own territories to confront him. In Gojjam, Tekle Giyorgis placed replaced the head of the local branch of the Solomonic dynasty, with his own favored princeling, Ras Adal, and tied Adal more closely to him by marrying him to his sister Woizero Laqech Gebre Medhin. In Shewa, Tekle Giyorgis arranged for his half brother Hailu Wolde Kiros to marry Woizero Tisseme Darge, daughter of Ras Darge Sahle Selassie and thus first cousin to the King of Shewa, Menelik. Tekle Giyorgis himself was married to Dinqinesh Mercha, sister of his Tigrean rival Dejazmatch Kassai. None of these ties of marriage would ultimately help solidify his hold on the throne. \"Dejazmach\" Kassai enlisted the services of John Kirkham to train his army in the weapons the British had left him, and in 1870, having gained access to the sea, an advantage none of the \"Dejazmach\"'s rivals had successfully obtained a new Abuna. Meanwhile, Menelik busied himself in Shewa, having decided according to Harold Marcus to allow his two rivals fight it out, despite Tekle Giyorgis' threatening march through Wollo to the borders of Shewa.\n\nEmperor Tekle Giyorgis knew he must stand alone against Kassai, but did not move until June 1871 when he crossed the Takazze River in Tigray. On 21 June the two armies met at Maikol'u to fight a day-long battle; although \"Dejazmach\" Kassai had the smaller force it was better disciplined, and as Kirkham later wrote, \"with 12 guns and 800 musketmen the battle was won against an undisciplined lot of men with matchlock guns and spears.\" Tekle Giyorgis came off the worse and retreated to the Mareb River the next day. However, the \"Dejazmach\" took another route, outflanked his opponent, and forced him into a cul-de-sac at Adwa, where they fought the final battle on 11 July. \"Leading a cavalry charge into the midst of Kasa's force, Tekla Giyorgis was wounded, had his mount killed under him, and was taken prisoner,\" Marcus recounts. \"His demoralized army collapsed and all his generals were captured with thousands of soldiers and camp followers.\" On 21 January 1872, Kassai proclaimed himself Emperor of Ethiopia with the name of Yohannes IV.\n\nTekle Giyorgis was blinded and imprisoned with his brother and mother at the Abba Garima Monastery near Adwa, where he died or was executed some years later.\n"}

He lived there until the age of four, when his family moved to Pantymwyn in Flintshire, Wales. Buckland started playing the guitar at the age of eleven, inspired by The Stone Roses, Ride, George Harrison, U2, and My Bloody Valentine, and also encouraged by his older brother Tim. He was a student at Ysgol y Waun and Alun School, the latter located in the Welsh town of Mold. He went on to study astronomy and mathematics at University College London, where he met future bandmates Chris Martin, Guy Berryman, and Will Champion, as well as their future manager Phil Harvey, and formed Coldplay.\n\nBuckland is noted for his sparse arrangements and use of slide.

He was one of the founders of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1870.\n\nSturgis was born in Baltimore County, Maryland. His parents were Russell Sturgis, a New York shipping merchant living temporarily in Baltimore, and Margaret Dawes (Appleton) Sturgis. \nHis paternal grandparents were Thomas Sturgis (1755-1821), who served as a Private in Captain Micah Hamlin's Company, Colonel Simeon Cary's Regiment (1776) and was the younger brother of the merchant Russell Sturgis (1750-1826), and Elizabeth (Jackson) Sturgis (1768-1844)). Sturgis is, therefore, a second cousin to the merchant and banker Russell Sturgis (1805–1887).\n\nEducated in the public schools of New York City, Sturgis was graduated from the Free Academy in New York (now the College of the City of New York) in 1856, and later studied architecture under Leopold Eidlitz. For about a year and a half he also studied in Munich. In 1862 he returned to the United States. He was associated with Peter Bonnett Wight from 1863 to 1868 and then practiced alone until 1880.\n\nin 1863 Sturgis together with the painter John William Hill, art critic Clarence Cook, and geologist and art critic Clarence King helped to found the Society for the Advancement of Truth in Art which published a journal \"The New Path.\" The articles written by Sturgis provided an early glimpse of his critical interest in art and architecture, made amply clear in his later writings.\n\nOn May 26, 1864, he married Sarah Maria Barney, daughter of Danford N. Barney of New York City. Her father served as president of Wells Fargo & Company from 1853 to 1866. Russell and Sarah Sturgis were the parents of four sons and three daughters, of whom one son died in infancy.\n\nBetween 1865 and 1880 he designed Battell Chapel and Lawrance, Farnham and Durfee Halls at Yale; the Homeopathic Medical College and Flower Hospital, New York City; the Farmers' and Mechanics' Bank of Albany; and churches, commercial buildings, and residences in New York City, Albany, Aurora, Tarrytown and Watertown, New York; New Haven, Farmington and Litchfield, Connecticut; Louisville, Kentucky; and Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nUpon the reorganization of the American Institute of Architects in 1868, Sturgis was elected secretary, while Richard Upjohn was president and R.G. Hatfield treasurer. Also in 1868, Sturgis published his \"Manual of the Jarves Collection of Early American Pictures in the Yale School of Fine Arts\". When the Metropolitan Museum of Art was established in 1870, Sturgis was a trustee and a member of the executive committee until 1876, also serving as corresponding secretary from 1870 to 1873. He designed the First Baptist Church at Tarrytown, New York about 1875.\n\nDuring the Exposition Universelle of 1878, Sturgis spent some months in France, and upon his return accepted the chair of architecture and the arts of design at the College of the City of New York. He was the co-author, with Charles Eliot Norton, of a \"Catalogue of Ancient and Modern Engravings, Woodcuts and Illustrated Books, Parts of the Collections of C.E. Norton and R. Sturgis\" (1879). On account of ill health he left his professorship and retired from business in 1880 and went to Europe. Residing chiefly in Paris and Florence, he remained abroad until 1884. For a short time after his return he was secretary of the New York Municipal Civil Service Board, but resigned out of dislike for the political complications involved in the position.\n\nHe trained architect Arthur Bates Jennings.\n\nOn December 30, 1886, Sturgis and his eldest son, Appleton, represented the family at the funeral of his wife's uncle, Ashbel H. Barney, retired president (1869–70) of Wells Fargo & Company.\n\nSturgis was a fellow of the American Institute of Architects and of the National Academy of Design; an honorary fellow of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences; a fellow in perpetuity of the Metropolitan Museum of Art; life member of the American Numismatic and Archaeological Society; honorary member of the National Society of Mural Painters; and a member of the Architectural League of New York (president in 1889-93), the Grolier Club, the Municipal Art Society, Archaeological Institute of America, National Sculpture Society, the Japan Society, the Fine Arts Federation of New York (first president, 1895–97); member of the University, Century and Players clubs of New York City; and a member of the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies in London.\n\nHe lectured on art at Columbia University, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York; the Peabody Institute of Baltimore and the Art Institute of Chicago; his Scammon Lectures of 1904-05 in Chicago were published under the title \"The Interdependence of the Arts of Design\" (1905). Sturgis received the honorary degrees of MA from Yale in 1870 and PhD from the College of the City of New York in 1893. A disciple of John Ruskin, Sturgis intensely disliked the trend toward neoclassic eclecticism at the end of the 19th century and hailed Louis H. Sullivan's work as the most significant that was being done in America.\n\nA leading authority on the history of architecture and art, Sturgis was editor for decorative art and medieval archaeology of the \"Century Dictionary\", editor of architecture and fine art for \"Johnson's Universal Cyclopaedia\" (1893–95); and compiler (for the American Library Association) of the \"Annotated Bibliography of Fine Art\" (1897). In January 1897 he became editor of \"The Field of Art\", a department of \"Scribner's Magazine\", which he continued until his death.\n\nHe is best known as a writer on art and architecture, making many contributions to dictionaries, encyclopedias and periodicals. He was editor-in-chief of \"A Dictionary of Architecture and Building\" (3 vols, 1901–1902). Sturgis edited and revised the English version of Wilhelm Luebke's \"Outlines of the History of Art\" (2 vols, 1904), and was editor on fine arts for the \"Encyclopedia Americana\" (1904–05). He wrote: \n\nDuring his last years he was nearly blind. He died on February 11, 1909, at his long-time home, 307 East 17th Street, in New York City. Sarah Sturgis died there on May 1, 1910.\n\n\n"}

Chapman-Taylor was also a skilled craftsman, builder, furniture designer, photographer and astrologer.\n\nJames Walter Chapman-Taylor was born in London in 1878 to Theodore Chapman-Taylor and his wife, Ada Thomas. In 1879 Theodore migrated to New Zealand where he purchased land a few miles south of Stratford in the Taranaki region. Ada Taylor, James and a younger brother joined him in June 1880 where they became dairy farmers.\n\nBy his teenage years Chapman-Taylor had decided against farming as a career and became an apprentice to a local builder. After completing his apprenticeship, he constructed his first building, a single- storied timber house for his parents on their Stratford property. On 12 April 1900 he married Mary Gibson at Stratford and in 1903 he enrolled himself in an architecture and design course with the International Correspondence Schools of Scranton, Pennsylvania. In 1904 he moved to Wellington after working on the construction of the Taihape railway station. From around 1907 he used the surname Chapman-Taylor.\n\nIn 1909 Chapman-Taylor travelled to England to study and meet first hand the works of C.F.A. Voysey, Baille Scott, and Parker and Unwin whose names were famous in the field of domestic architecture. Upon his return to New Zealand Chapman-Taylor was determined to follow the basic principles on which good domestic architecture had been developed – designing and building houses with skill and sensitivity. He was influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement's interpretation of rural English cottage construction and style and returned to New Zealand to integrate this into New Zealand materials and settings.\n\nAs a mature style emerged, Chapman-Taylor's designs became more cohesive. Concrete was used as the preferred building material, finishing the outside walls in a roughcast plaster. Following in the footsteps and adhering to principles first exposed by John Ruskin and William Morris the consistency in his work became a result of his loyalty to their creed. Chapman-Taylor showed confidence to express his individuality and sense of freedom to explore and experiment. Chapman-Taylor's houses were designed through to the smallest detail. Many of his surviving buildings include pieces of his furniture designs. Exteriors were characterised by high roofs with Marseille tiles, plain roughcast walls and small paned windows. The extensive use of hand shaped timbers in the interiors of the houses further defined his work. Chapman-Taylorʼs houses revealed his distinctive touch and his interpretation of the English cottage style that the Arts and Crafts Movement promoted. Chapman-Taylor designed many houses and they can be found throughout New Zealand. Several examples can be found in Taranaki, including the building fondly known as Wilkie's Castle, situated at Wai-iti in North Taranaki. In Havelock North he designed the Whare Ra building for the Stella Matutina order.\n\nChapman-Taylor died 28 October 1958 at the age of 80 years from a sudden illness.\n\n\"All Chapman-Taylor’s houses are economical in their use of space, intimate in detailing, and extremely satisfying to live in.\" —J. Stacpoole and P.

Dinitrophenylhydrazine is a red to orange solid. It is a substituted hydrazine, and is often used to qualitatively test for carbonyl groups associated with aldehydes and ketones. The hydrazone derivatives can also be used as evidence toward the identity of the original compound. The melting point of the derivative is often used, with reference to a database of values, to determine the identity of a specific carbonyl compound. It is relatively sensitive to shock and friction; it is a shock explosive so care must be taken with its use. To reduce its explosive hazard, it is usually supplied wet.\n\nGuaranteed known to be used for hydrazone formation in the synthesis of Sivifene.\n2,4-Dinitrophenylhydrazine is commercially available usually as a wet powder. It can be prepared by the reaction of hydrazine sulfate with 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene:\n\nBrady's reagent is prepared by dissolving 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine in a solution containing methanol and some concentrated sulfuric acid. The medium should be slightly acidic.\n\n2,4-Dinitrophenylhydrazine can be used to qualitatively detect the carbonyl functionality of a ketone or aldehyde functional group. A positive test is signalled by the formation of a yellow, orange or red precipitate (known as a dinitrophenylhydrazone). If the carbonyl compound is aromatic, then the precipitate will be red; if aliphatic, then the precipitate will have a more yellow color. The reaction between 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine and a generic ketone to form a hydrazone is shown below:\n\nThis reaction is, overall, a condensation reaction as two molecules joining together with loss of water. Mechanistically, it is an example of addition-elimination reaction: nucleophilic addition of the -NH group to the C=O carbonyl group, followed by the elimination of a HO molecule:\n\nCrystals of different hydrazones have characteristic melting and boiling points, allowing the identity of a substance to be determined in a method known as derivatization. In particular, the use of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine was developed by Brady and Elsmie. Modern spectroscopic and spectrometric techniques have superseded these techniques.\n\nDinitrophenylhydrazine does not react with other carbonyl-containing functional groups such as carboxylic acids, amides, and esters, for which there is resonance-associated stability as a lone-pair of electrons interacts with the p orbital of the carbonyl carbon resulting in increased delocalization in the molecule. This stability would be lost by addition of a reagent to the carbonyl group. Hence, these compounds are more resistant to addition reactions. Also, with carboxylic acids, there is the effect of the compound acting as a base, leaving the resulting carboxylate negatively charged and hence no longer vulnerable to nucleophilic attack.\n"}

Gas leaks can be hazardous to health and the environment. Even a small leak into a building or other confined space may gradually build up an explosive or lethal concentration of gas. Leaks of natural gas and refrigerant gas into the atmosphere are especially harmful due to their global warming potential and ozone depletion potential.\n\nLeaks of gases associated with industrial operations and equipment are also generally known as fugitive emissions. Natural gas leaks from fossil fuel extraction and use are known as fugitive gas emissions. Such unintended leaks should not be confused with similar intentional types of gas release, such as:\nGas leaks should also not be confused with \"gas seepage\" from the earth or oceans - either natural or due to human activity.\n\nPure natural gas is colorless and odorless, and is composed primarily of methane. Unpleasant scents in the form of traces of mercaptans are usually added, to assist in identifying leaks. This odor may be perceived as rotting eggs, or a faintly unpleasant skunk smell. Persons detecting the odor must evacuate the area and abstain from using open flames or operating electrical equipment, to reduce the risk of fire and explosion.\n\nAs a result of the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 passed in the United States, federal safety standards require companies providing natural gas to conduct safety inspections for gas leaks in homes and other buildings receiving natural gas. The gas company is required to inspect gas meters and inside gas piping from the point of entry into the building to the outlet side of the gas meter for gas leaks. This may require entry into private homes by the natural gas companies to check for hazardous conditions.\n\nGas leaks can damage or kill plants. In addition to leaks from natural gas pipes, methane and other gases migrating from landfill garbage disposal sites can also cause chlorosis and necrosis in grass, weeds, or trees. In some cases, leaking gas may migrate as far as from the source of the leak to an affected tree.\n\nMethane is an asphyxiant gas which can reduce the normal oxygen concentration in breathing air. Small animals and birds are also more sensitive to toxic gas like carbon monoxide that are sometimes present with natural gas. The expression \"canary in a coal mine\" derives from the historical practice of using a canary as an animal sentinel to detect dangerously high concentrations of naturally occurring coal gas.\n\nMethane, the primary constituent of natural gas, is up to 120 times as potent a greenhouse gas as carbon dioxide. Thus, the release of unburned natural gas produces much stronger effects than the carbon dioxide that would have been released if the gas had been burned as intended.\n\nIn the United States, most state and federal agencies have adopted the Gas Piping and Technology Committee (GPTC) standards for grading natural gas leaks.\n\nA \"Grade 1 leak\" is a leak that represents an existing or probable hazard to persons or property, and requires immediate repair or continuous action until the conditions are no longer hazardous.\nExamples of a Grade 1 leak are:\n\nA \"Grade 2 leak\" is a leak that is recognized as being non-hazardous at the time of detection, but justifies scheduled repair based on probable future hazard.\nExamples of a Grade 2 Leak are:\n\nA \"Grade 3 leak\" is non-hazardous at the time of detection and can be reasonably expected to remain non-hazardous.\nExamples of a Grade 3 Leak are:\n\nIn 2012, Boston University professor Nathan Phillips and his students drove along all of Boston roads with a gas sensor, identifying 3300 leaks. The Conservation Law Foundation produced a map showing around 4000 leaks reported to the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities. In July 2014, the Environmental Defense Fund released an interactive online map based on gas sensors attached to three mapping cars which already were being driven along Boston streets to update Google Earth Street View. This survey differed from the previous studies in that an estimate of leak severity was produced, rather than just leak detection. This map should help the gas utility to prioritize leak repairs, as well as raising public awareness of the problem.\n\nIn 2017, Rhode Island released an estimated 15.7 million metric tons of greenhouse gases, about a third of which comes from leaks in natural gas pipes. This figure, published in 2019, was calculated based on an assumed leakage rate of 2.7% (as that is the rate of leakage in the nearby city of Boston). The study's authors estimated that fixing the leaks would incur an annual cost of $1.6 billion to $4 billion.\n\nLegislation passed in 2014 requires gas suppliers to make greater efforts to control some of the 20,000 documented leaks in the US state of Massachusetts. The new law requires grade 1 and 2 leaks to be repaired if the street above a gas pipe is dug up, and requires priority be given to leaks near schools. It provides a mechanism for increased revenue from ratepayers (up to 1.5% without further approval) to cover the cost of repairs and replacement of leak-prone materials (like cast iron and non-cathodically protected steel) on an accelerated basis. The law sets a target of 20 years for replacement of pipes made from leak-prone materials if feasible given the revenue cap; , Columbia Gas of Massachusetts (formerly named \"\"Bay State Gas\"\"), Berkshire Gas, Liberty Utilities, National Grid, and Unitil say they will meet this target, but NSTAR says it will take 25 years to complete. Leaks, statistics on leak-prone materials, and financial statements are reported annually to the Department of Public Utilities, which also has responsibility for rate-setting.\n\nAdditional proposals not included in the law would have required grade 3 leaks to be repaired during road construction, and priority for leaks which are killing trees or which were near hospitals or churches.\n\nAn attorney for the Conservation Law Foundation stated that the leaks were worth $38.8 million in lost natural gas, which also contributes 4% of the state's greenhouse gas emissions. A federal study prompted by US Senator Edward J. Markey concluded that Massachusetts consumers paid approximately $1.5 billion from 2000–2011 for gas which leaked and benefited no one. Markey has also backed legislation that would implement similar requirements at the national level, along with financing provisions for repairs.\n\nCatastrophic gas leaks, such as the Bhopal disaster are well-recognized as problems, but the more-subtle effects of chronic low-level leaks have been slower to gain recognition.\n\nIn work with dangerous gases (such as in a lab or industrial setting), a gas leak may require hazmat emergency response, especially if the leaked material is flammable, explosive, corrosive, or toxic.\n\n\n"}

In household accidents, the principal explosive gases are those used for heating or cooking purposes such as natural gas, methane, propane, butane. In industrial explosions many other gases, like hydrogen, as well as evaporated (gaseous) gasoline (American English)/petrol (British English) or ethanol play an important role. Industrial gas explosions can be prevented with the use of intrinsic safety barriers to prevent ignition.\n\nWhether a mixture of air and gas is combustible depends on the air-to-fuel ratio. For each fuel, ignition occurs only within a certain range of concentration, known as the upper and lower flammability limits. For example, for methane and gasoline vapor, this range is 5-15% and 1.4-7.6% gas to air, respectively. An explosion can only occur when fuel concentration is within these limits.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was a number-one \"Billboard\" Hot 100 hit for two weeks in the summer of 1989. An edited version of the song is included in the imported version of the album \"Toy Soldiers: The Best of Martika\".\n\nMartika wrote the song about a friend who was battling a cocaine addiction. \"I was a little hesitant because I had only written two songs before and they were light songs. I came up to Michael and said I wanted to write about drugs. It was the first time I got the nerve to write about something that was scary for me to talk about, so I did.\" According to an episode of VH-1's \"Pop-Up Video\", in which \"Toy Soldiers\" was featured, the friend-in-question eventually conquered the addiction.\n\nThe song is performed in the key of C minor with a tempo of 65 beats per minute in time. The song follows a chord progression of A–B–A–B–Cm–B–Cm–Gm–Cm–B.\n\nMartika is the lead singer throughout the song, although she is joined on the chorus by some of her former castmates from \"Kids Incorporated\", including Renee Sands, Fergie, Rahsaan Patterson as well as later cast members Jennifer Love Hewitt, Devyn Puett and Kimberly McCullough as backup vocalists.\n\nThe video for the song was directed by Jim Shea, who later became a regular in directing country music videos. Martika is seen singing with a waterfall in front of her (this was done by filming her in an empty pool with a water current flowing between her and the camera).\n\nThe song spent two weeks at number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in the U.S. and New Zealand while reaching number five in both the United Kingdom and Australia. On \"Billboard\"s year-end chart for 1989, \"Toy Soldiers\" placed number 29. It was Martika's only number-one single in the U.S., and her highest-ranking single in the United Kingdom. The single was certified Gold in the United States by the RIAA.\n\nIn March and April 2009, VH1 ran a countdown of the \"100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders of the 80s\". \"Toy Soldiers\" placed at #67 on the countdown despite the fact that Martika had three other top 40 hits: \"More Than You Know\" (#18); \"I Feel the Earth Move\" (#25); and \"Love... Thy Will Be Done\" (#10).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBryan Buss of AllMusic retrospectively reviewed the \"Martika\" album, stating \"the big hit single, 'Toy Soldiers', works with its childlike vocals and lyrics, creating a haunting, effective dichotomy with its subject of drug addiction.\" Buss also highlighted the song as an album standout by labeling it an AMG Pick Track. Rob Theakston of Allmusic labeled the song as an AMG Pick Track on the 2005 compilation \"Toy Soldiers: The Best of Martika\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1919641", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1919641", "title": "Lawn mower racing", "text": "Lawn mower racing\n\nLawnmower racing is a form of motorsport in which competitors race modified lawnmowers, usually of the ride-on or self-propelled variety. The original mower engines are retained, but blades are removed for safety. The sport attracts all ages, and is usually entered into in a spirit of fun rather than extreme competitiveness, though many participants do take it seriously.\n\nThe earliest record of an organised race involving lawnmowers in the United Kingdom is in 1968 when the Ashton on Mersey Cricket Club organised a sporting event by the name \"Lawn Mower Grand Prix\" for the benefit fund of Lancashire cricketer Ken Higgs. The event consisted of a dash over 880 yards and was sponsored by Esso and Player's No. 6 cigarettes. The event was won by Daily Mirror journalist Roy Allett and Jimmy Savile came third. Savile reportedly prayed before competing and remarked that he has never driven a lawn mower before, \"How can you mow in a council flat?\"\n\nThe British Lawn Mower Racing Association (BLMRA) was formed in 1973 by Rally co-driver Jim Gavin. Jim and a bunch of fellow sporting enthusiasts were bemoaning the prohibitive costs of getting involved in any kind of motor sport whilst enjoying a pint at The Cricketers Arms in Wisborough Green, West Sussex. They looked across the village green and noticed the groundsman mowing the cricket pitch. Realising that everyone had a lawn mower in their garden shed they asked themselves: Why not race them? A local venue was found and 80 mowers turned up for that first meeting. \n\nThere are now several Lawn Mower Racing clubs in the UK with slightly differing construction rules but a similar ethos that events should be professionally run and costs kept to a minimum. Racing tends to take place in bare fields, with the track marked in a temporary fashion typically using bales or plastic blocks. The racing format is generally either sprint or endurance, although fun races take various formats including relay and last man standing. There are various championships held throughout the racing season.\n\nInitially mowers were self propelled models such as the Suffolk Punch which were re-geared and required the operator to run behind. These quickly gave way to larger cylinder mowers with towed seats which are now referred to as Group 2. Groups 3 and 4 followed in time, these are wheel driven ride-on mowers, Group 3 being an open engined garden rider (typically the Westwood Lawnbug) and Group 4 being a lawn tractor. All mowers must have their blades removed, retain specified original components such as their chassis, bonnet and drive configuration. Engine regulations vary between clubs, but these are standard lawn mower type engines with little or no modification or tuning. Given the right track conditions mowers can reach speeds of up to 50mph although track design serves to limit this and ensure that driver skill remains an important element of the sport.\n\nOne of the best known events is the annual BLMRA 12 hour endurance race which has been held near Wisborough Green since 1978. The first such event was won by Sir Stirling Moss, Derek Bell and Tony Hazlewood (designer and builder of the Westwood Lawnbug). Actor Oliver Reed also participated. The event attracts participants from other British clubs and from all over the world, including competitors from France, Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, Finland and the United States. 2018 saw the win taken by an overseas entrant for the first time in the event's history when it was won by a team from Luxembourg. The current distance record over the 12 hours sits at 354.5 miles.\n\nThe Twelve Mile 500 is a lawn mower race held in the small town of Twelve Mile, Indiana, organized by the Twelve Mile Lions Club and occurring annually on Independence Day. The tradition began in 1963 as a race for factory-built mowers with their mowing decks removed but in 1996 split into a two-race event with one for four-cycle Briggs lawn mowers and another for modified mowers. The race adopted the \"Grand Prix\" style in 1970 and has been held in Plank Hill Park ever since. The race structure has once again changed with the addition of another race. The 2010 race included a superstock race in addition to the briggs and modified races.\nThe Twelve Mile 500 consists of a 15-mile, 60-lap course run on a quarter-mile track in the park, with a maximum of 33 entrants per race. Each participating team consists of a driver, a two-person pit crew and a lap judge, and must meet a speed of approximately 30 mph to qualify just like in NASCAR racing.\n\nThe sport was taken to the United States by the makers of a petrol stabiliser called Sta-bil, who had visited the UK and witnessed a race meeting. It has since grown to have multiple national organizations, including the U.S. Lawn Mower Racing Association and the American Racing Mower Association.\n\nLawnmower racing should not be confused with go-karting, wherein lawn mower engines have often been used, especially amongst the amateur participants in go-karting. Lawn mower racing is based firmly around the use of both engines and chassis from regular model mowers. Also, where go-karts are exclusively raced on relatively flat surfaces, lawn mowers can be raced off-road.\n\nSince the summer of 1984, the North Wilkesporo Rotary Club has played host to lawnmower racing at its Wilkes County Agricultural Fairground facility. Sanctioned by the Allegheny Mower Racing Association, oval track racing on the dirt is reminiscent of the beginnings of stock car racing at the North Wilkesboro Speedway and the birth of NASCAR. Crowds have grown from a few hundred to gatherings of thousands on several Saturday nights from June through September. The Wilkes County fairground site is said by many participants to be the premier facility within the AMRA circus.\n\nProceeds from the club's lawnmower racing events are distributed throughout the year to the many activities supported by the North Wilkesboro Rotary Club. The club contributes to most local United Way agencies, provides annual scholarships to local high school students, holds a Christmas Party for the county's foster children, while also supporting worldwide relief efforts of Rotary International.\n\nStarting in the spring of 2013 lawn mower racing has been held every other Saturday in Patton, Missouri. Racers from all over Southeast Missouri and parts of Arkansas come to the Patton Saddle Club to race their racing machines. The races are held due to a merging of the Southeast Missouri Lawn Mower Racing Association (SMLMRA for short) and the Patton Lions Club. Hundreds of fans come to watch the races at only five dollars a car load. All proceeds are taken care of by the Lions Club.\n\nRacers vary in age from six to seventy in five separate classes. Kids (6–12 years old) run in the Youth Class. Their mowers are limited to a stock lawn mower engine with a governor set to no more than 3650 rpm and a 10:1 gear ratio. Adults classes are split by running time trials. Time trials are set up like a qualifying run in NASCAR. A-Class is the mowers that run the fastest times. D-Class is the mowers that run the slowest during time trials. B and C-Class are in between the other two.\n\nMowers are unlimited to engine sizes; however, safety is a big role in the rules. All racers are expected to wear full-face helmets, gloves, boots, a long-sleeve racing shirt, and a neck restraint. Mowers must be equipped with back bumpers (no front bumpers), leg protectors where the feet would be on the mower, a kill switch to turn off the engine in case of an accident, working brakes, cupholders, and a plate on the right-hand side of the hood to keep starters from blowing out of the sides if an engine were to blow up.\n\nThe first female youth lawn mower racer came from Missouri. Her name was Gabby. She raced her first race Fall of 2006 and at the age of 6. Many female racers have come after her. She began racing to spend time with her father then began to love the sport herself.\n\nAnother popular destination for this form of Motorsport is New Mexico. Contrary to other regions, there are strict rules concerning the class of lawnmower as well as the manner in which they are operated. Starting in January 1983, the lawnmowers used were primarily John Deere, however, due to the dangerous horsepower produced by these engines, this class of lawnmower was no longer found acceptable to race. In 2012, Craftsmen was declared the most used lawnmower brand in New Mexico. Craftsmen had reported 290 racers using this brand in the 127 races in New Mexico that year. Later in 2015 new rules were imposed lied on the lawn mower racing system In New Mexico preventing lawn mower racing to occur in populated locations.\n\nAustralia's first mower race was dreamt up in a small, country pub in Harrietville, Victoria in 1978. Five men challenged each other to a race around the local hills of the area after an alcohol-related argument. They chugged up the steep slopes belching smoke from their unmodified Briggs & Strattons (popular lawnmower brands), rounded a nominated gum tree, then flew down in \"Angel Gear\" – Australian outback slang for neutral – to the finish line. \"Half the town's 100 people, 300 sheep and 150 dogs were there,\" according to Brian Ross, six-time president of the Australian Ride-On Lawn Mower Racing Association (AROLMRA)\n"}

After an apprenticeship as a silversmith during 1924–1927, Bill took up studies at the Bauhaus in Dessau under many teachers including Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee and Oskar Schlemmer from 1927 to 1929, after which he moved to Zurich.\n\nAfter working on graphic designs for the few modern buildings being constructed, he built his first work, his own house and studio (1932–3) in Zurich-Höngg. From 1937 onwards he was a prime mover behind the Allianz group of Swiss artists.\n\nBill is widely considered the single most decisive influence on Swiss graphic design beginning in the 1950s with his theoretical writing and progressive work. His connection to the days of the Modern Movement gave him special authority. As an industrial designer, his work is characterized by a clarity of design and precise proportions. Examples are the elegant clocks and watches designed for Junghans, a long-term client. Among Bill's most notable product designs is the \"\"Ulmer Hocker\"\" of 1954, a stool that can also be used as a shelf element, a speaker's desk, a tablet or a side table. Although the stool was a creation of Bill and Ulm school designer Hans Gugelot, it is often called \"\"Bill Hocker\"\" because the first sketch on a cocktail napkin was Bill's work.\n\nAs a designer and artist, Bill sought to create forms which visually represent the New Physics of the early 20th century. He sought to create objects so that the new science of form could be understood by the senses: that is as a concrete art. Thus Bill is not a rationalist – as is typically thought – but rather a phenomenologist. One who understands embodiment as the ultimate expression of a concrete art. In this way he is not so much extending as re-interpreting Bauhaus theory. Yet curiously Bill's critical interpreters have not really grasped this fundamental issue. He made spare geometric paintings and spherical sculptures, some based on the Möbius strip, in stone, wood, metal and plaster. His architectural work included an office building in Germany, a radio studio in Zurich, and a bridge in eastern Switzerland. \n\nHe continued to produce architectural designs, such as those for a museum of contemporary art (1981) in Florence and for the Bauhaus Archive (1987) in Berlin. In 1982 he also entered a competition for an addition to the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin, built to a design by Mies van der Rohe. \"Pavillon-Skulptur (1979–83)\", a large granite sculpture, was installed adjacent to the Bahnhofstrasse, Zürich in 1983. As is often the case with modern art in public places, the installation generated some controversy. \"Endlose Treppe\" (1991), a sculpture made of North American granite, was designed for the philosopher Ernst Bloch.\n\nIn 1982 he was awarded the Sir Misha Black award and was added to the College of Medallists.\n\nIn 1944, Bill became a professor at the Kunstgewerbeschule Zürich. In 1953, alongside Inge Aicher-Scholl and Otl Aicher, he founded the Ulm School of Design (German: \"Hochschule für Gestaltung - HfG Ulm\") in Ulm, Germany, a design school initially created in the tradition of the Bauhaus and which later developed a new design education approach integrating art and science. The school was notable for its inclusion of semiotics as a field of study. The school closed in 1968. Faculty and students included Tomás Maldonado, Otl Aicher, Josef Albers, Johannes Itten, John Lottes, Walter Zeischegg, and Peter Seitz.\n\nBill was a professor at the Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg and chair of Environmental Design from 1967 to 1974. In 1973 he became an associate member of the Royal Flemish Academy of Science, Literature and Fine Art in Brussels. In 1976 he became a member of the Berlin Academy of Arts. In addition to his teaching, Bill wrote and lectured extensively on art, architecture and design, appearing at symposiums and design conferences around the world. In particular, he wrote books about Le Corbusier, Kandinsky, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and artistic theory.\n\nBill executed many public sculptures in Europe and exhibited extensively in galleries and museums, including a retrospective at the Kunsthaus Zürich in 1968–69. He had his first exhibition in the United States at the Staempfli Gallery in New York City in 1963 and was the subject of retrospectives at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 1974, and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City in 1988. He participated in documentas I (1955), II (1959), and III (1964). In 1993, he received the Praemium Imperiale for sculpture, awarded by the Emperor of Japan.\n\nBill is credited with having been \"the spark that lighted the fuse of Brazil's artistic revolution\" and the country's \"movement toward concrete art\" with his 1951 retrospective at the São Paulo Museum of Modern Art. He strongly influenced Brazilian artists like Franz Weissmann.\n\nAfter a liaison with Nusch Éluard, Bill married the cellist and photographer Binia Mathilde Spoerri in January 1931. She died in 1988. From 1974 he was living together with art historian Angela Thomas; they married in 1991.\n\nBill was also involved in politics. He was elected to the Zurich municipal council in 1961. From 1967 to 1971, he served as a member of the Swiss National Council.\n\nBill died en route to a hospital after collapsing from a heart attack at Berlin Tegel Airport. He was 85 and lived in Zumikon, a Zürich suburb. \n\nIn 1996, Jakob Bill, the son of Max, founded the Swiss Max Bill Foundation (\"max, binia + jakob bill stiftung\") and implemented the idea of his father. The purpose of the foundation is to collect and take care of the works in possession of the Bill family, as well as the promotion of scientific research.\n\n\n\n"}

The trunkline runs through residential areas south of St. Joseph and through the central business districts of the twin cities. Further north, M-63 runs along the Lake Michigan shoreline.\n\nAll of M-63's routing was part of US 33 before that highway's truncation south of Niles in 1986. A previous designation of M-63 was used farther north in Lake and Osceola counties from 1919 until 1961. Since the current designation was created, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) has worked on reconfiguring parts of the roadway in the early part of the 21st century. The bridge M-63 uses to cross the St. Joseph River, the Blossomland Bridge, has been identified as an historic structure using a rare design. The bridge itself dates back to the late 1940s.\n\nM-63 begins at the intersection of Niles, Scottdale and Miners roads southwest of St. Joseph in Royalton Township. M-139 runs on Niles Road northwest from Berrien Springs to this point and on Scottdale Road north of the intersection. M-63 follows Miners Road west and then Niles Road northwest of the junction, parallel to the St. Joseph River through residential areas on the outskirts of the twin cities. The highway meets Interstate 94 (I-94) at the latter's exit 27 and continues through St. Joseph Township to the city of St. Joseph. In the city, after Washington Avenue, Niles Road becomes Niles Avenue and turns north. As part of its maintenance duties, the MDOT tracks traffic volumes on the state highways in a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a calculation of the average traffic level for any day of a year. The roadway segment along Niles Avenue north of the Napier Avenue intersection in 2009 had the highest traffic levels along all of M-63 at 22,263 vehicles.\n\nAt Main Street, Niles Avenue ends, and M-63 joins Business Loop I-94 (BL I-94) on Main Street into and through the downtown business district. The two highways continue together running concurrently to Ship and Port streets. These two streets form a one-way pair running east to carry BL I-94 to and from a separate bridge over the St. Joseph River. M-63 continues along Main Street across the river into Benton Harbor, Michigan where it follows the Lake Michigan shoreline along a short expressway segment. The trunkline exits Benton Harbor near the headquarters of the Whirlpool Corporation. North of town, the highway provides access to many lakeshore properties north of Benton Harbor at it continues northeasterly along the shoreline to the community of Lake Michigan Beach. When the highway meets Hagar Shore Road, M-63 turns east along that roadway to an interchange with I-196/US 31. The shoreline roadway continues northeast as A-2 (Blue Star Highway) while M-63 terminates at an interchange with I-196/US 31. This northernmost segment of the highway had the lowest AADT measurement in 2009 when calculated by MDOT at 2,855 vehicles.\n\nVarious highways in the United States are listed as a part of the National Highway System (NHS), a system of roads important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. M-63 has been listed as a part of the NHS from its southern terminus to the northern junction with BL I-94 in St. Joseph. As the closest state highway to Lake Michigan in the area, M-63 from the southern junction with BL I-94 to its northern terminus has been used as a part of the Lake Michigan Circle Tour, a tourist route that circles Lake Michigan.\n\nM-63 originally ran from Peacock in Lake County west through Luther to M-13 (later US 131) in Osceola County on July 1, 1919. This highway was extended in 1930 along US 131 to Tustin and then to a terminus with M-66 in Marion. At the same time, M-37 was extended north from Baldwin to meet M-63 east of Peacock. This eastern extension was truncated in 1932 when it was redesignated as part of M-61. A short connector roadway, M-179, was designated in 1935 between M-63 and US 131, forming a small triangle of highways. The western end was shortened in 1939 so that M-63 ended at M-37 instead of continuing west to Peacock. The M-179 designation was decommissioned in 1959 or 1960, removing that short highway from the state trunkline highway system. M-63 was decommissioned in 1961 when the roadway was transferred back to local control.\n\nThe current designation of M-63 was created in 1986. Before the designation, US 33 ran north into Michigan south of Niles. From there it followed US 31 north to Scottdale and ran alone to St. Joseph and Benton Harbor. When US 33 was truncated back to Niles, M-63 was commissioned in its place along the route it now follows. The numbering change happened in September 1986.\n\nThe expressway portion of M-63 is a relic of a now revised plan of a freeway corridor through the St. Joseph–Benton Harbor area. The highway was significantly reconfigured in 2000–2002, with the overpass over the industrial access road to Whirlpool's warehouse in Benton Harbor and a rail line removed and rebuilt in late 2000 through early 2001, and one of the two grade-separated interchanges, at Klock Road, demolished and downgraded to an at-grade intersection in 2002. Today, there are only two overpasses over smaller roads existing on this stretch of expressway.\n\nIn 2016, all of M-63 was designated as part of the West Michigan Pike Pure Michigan Byway.\n\nThe Blossomland Bridge over the St. Joseph River is eligible to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The span is a Scherzer rolling-lift bascule, a type of moveable bridge. The bridge was built as part of a 1940s plan to relocate US 31 through St. Joseph and Benton Harbor. Those plans were delayed by World War II. The bridge was completed in late 1948 using the rare design prepared by a firm from Chicago that specialized in bascule bridges. The state paid a total of $1.3 million for what was called \"the largest bridge ever built under the auspices of the State Highway Department\".\n\n"}

The arena opened in October 1999. It is Little Rock's main entertainment venue.\n\nThe Arkansas–Little Rock Trojans played home games at the arena from the time when the arena opened until the team moved in 2005 to a new arena, the Jack Stephens Center, on the school's campus in Little Rock. The Arkansas RiverBlades, a defunct ice hockey team of the ECHL, the Arkansas RimRockers, a defunct minor league basketball team of the NBA Development League, and the Arkansas Twisters, a defunct af2 team, also played at the arena. The arena is also used for other events, including concerts, rodeos, auto racing, professional wrestling, and trade shows and conventions.\n\nOn August 1, 1995, Pulaski County, Arkansas, voters approved a one-year, one-cent sales tax for the purpose of building a multi-purpose arena, expanding the Statehouse Convention Center in Little Rock, and making renovations to the Main Street bridge between Little Rock and North Little Rock. $20 million of the sales tax proceeds went toward the Convention Center expansion, with the remainder used to build the arena.\n\nThat money, combined with a $20 million contribution from the State of Arkansas, $17 million from private sources and $7 million from Little Rock-based Alltel Corporation paid for the construction of a arena, which cost nearly $80 million to build. When the doors opened in 1999, the facility was paid for and there was no public indebtedness.\n\nTwo sites in North Little Rock drew interest from county officials for the proposed arena. The first was a commercial site west of Interstate 30, which contained a strip mall, a Kroger and an abandoned K-Mart storefront. The second site was an plot at the foot of the Broadway Bridge.\n\nThe Pulaski County Multipurpose Civic Center Facilities Board selected the larger site for the arena in 1996 and paid $3.7 million for the land, some of which was acquired through eminent domain, a move protested in court by several landowners.\nThe second site later would be chosen for the new baseball stadium, Dickey-Stephens Park, constructed for the Arkansas Travelers. The Class AA minor-league baseball team moved from the then 73-year-old Ray Winder Field in Little Rock to a new $28 million home in North Little Rock at the start of the 2007 season.\n\nThe arena was the home of the 2003, 2006, and 2009 Southeastern Conference women's basketball tournament and the 2000 Sun Belt Conference men’s basketball tournament. The Arena holds the all-time attendance record for an SEC Women's Tournament when 43,642 people attended the event in 2003.\n\nThe arena hosted portions of the first and second rounds of the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament in March 2008 and the SEC Gymnastics Championships in 2007.\n\nThe arena is also used for other events: concerts (seating capacity is between 15,000 and 18,000 for end-stage concerts; the arena has an 80-by-40-foot portable stage); rodeos and auto racing (seating capacity is 14,000); and trade shows and conventions (there are of arena floor space plus of meeting space and of pre-function space). As a concert venue, its location prompted Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band to play one of its most rarely performed numbers, 1973's \"Mary Queen of Arkansas\", during a March 2000 show on their Reunion Tour.\n\nThe arena is owned by the Multi-Purpose Civic Center Facilities Board for Pulaski County. The arena was designed by the Civic Center Design Team (CCDT), Burt Taggart & Associates, Architects/Engineers, The Wilcox Group, Garver & Garver Engineering and Rosser International of Atlanta.\n\nThe arena held the 2004, 2007 and 2009 American Idols LIVE! Tour concerts on August 13, 2004, July 13, 2007 and July 25, 2009, respectively.\n\nBecause of the $28.1 billion sale of Alltel to Verizon Wireless, as of June 30, 2009, the Alltel Arena was renamed Verizon Arena.\n\nFleetwood Mac performed at Verizon Arena May 4, 2013 with surprise guests former President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton attending the show. Fleetwood Mac drummer Mick Fleetwood introduced the couple, who were seated in an arena suite, to the sold-out audience and dedicated the song \"Don't Stop\" to them, which was appropriately Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential election campaign song.\n\nOn October 5, 2016, the arena hosted the Kellogg's Tour of Gymnastics Champions.\n\nIn 2019 the naming rights to the venue will be changed from Verizon to Arkansas based Simmons Bank. The deal was announced in November 9, 2018. The name change became official on October 3, 2019. \n"}

The arena, which opened in 1969, is best known as the former home of the Auburn men's and women's basketball, women's gymnastics, and wrestling teams. The teams finished their stays at the facility at the end of the 2009–10 season, with all of its tenants moving into the new Auburn Arena opening in time for the 2010–11 season. In addition to sports, numerous concerts were held in the facility. The coliseum continues to house athletics offices as well as classrooms and office space for Auburn's Department of Geosciences.\n\nThe building's exterior is primarily nondescript concrete, but its entry plaza was recognizable for the large \"War Eagle\" statue which faced not only the rest of the university, but also nearby Jordan–Hare Stadium.\n\nThe building was approved by the state legislature in 1965 to replace the Auburn Sports Arena, a small on-campus building in use from 1946 until the building of the Coliseum. The state supplied the majority of the funds, with the federal government, the University and an athletics department pledge drive making up the rest of the $6,033,597 needed. It was originally named the Memorial Coliseum, in memory of the Auburn war dead of the 20th century.\n\nThe coliseum opened January 11, 1969 for a basketball game against Louisiana State University. Auburn upset the Pistol Pete Maravich-led LSU team.\n\nIn 1987, it was renamed for Joel H. Eaves, a former basketball player and coach who guided the Tigers to their first Southeastern Conference title in 1960 and is the school's all-time winningest coach. It received its current name six years later, adding the name of Jeff Beard, athletic director from 1951 to 1972 during some of Auburn's best years athletically.\n\nOriginally, the arena seated 12,500 people. Due to Americans with Disabilities Act requirements, it was downsized to 10,108 in 1994. Since 1998, it has seated 10,500.\n\nOn March 25–27, 1971, the Memorial Coliseum hosted the 41st Annual NCAA Wrestling Championships.\n\nOn March 5, 1974, Elvis Presley performed a sold-out show at the Memorial Coliseum.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1919710", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1919710", "title": "Coleman Coliseum", "text": "Coleman Coliseum\n\nColeman Coliseum is a 15,383-seat multi-purpose arena in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, on the campus of the University of Alabama. It is the current home of the Alabama Crimson Tide men's and women's basketball and women's gymnastics teams, and previously served as the home of the women's volleyball program. Opened in 1968 as Memorial Coliseum as a replacement for Foster Auditorium (the current name was adopted in 1988), the coliseum is located at the center of the University of Alabama's athletic complex, which also includes Sewell-Thomas Stadium, Sam Bailey Track & Field Stadium, the Hank Crisp Indoor Facility, the Mal M. Moore Athletic Facility and the football building and practice fields.\n\nIn addition to its primary duties as an athletic facility, the coliseum has on numerous occasions served as a venue for artistic performances, musical concerts, and presidential appearances.\n\nColeman Coliseum is named for Jefferson Jackson Coleman, a prominent University of Alabama alumnus. Jefferson Coleman was the first pledge of Theta Sigma Fraternity that would later become the basis for starting the current National Delta Chi Fraternity Chapter at The University on February 12, 1927. Jefferson went on to serve The University in many capacities, from Business Manager of the football team to Director of Alumni Affairs, for almost 50 years. Until his death in 1995, he was the only person that had attended every Alabama bowl game, starting with the Rose Bowl on January 1, 1926. In 1988, The University honored him by renaming Memorial Coliseum after him. In addition, he served Delta Chi nationally by serving in various positions, most notably as “AA” from 1954 to 1956. For his meritorious and inconspicuous service, Jeff was inducted into The Order of the White Carnation.\n\nThe coliseum opened its doors for the first time on January 30, 1968, for the traveling Broadway show \"The Roar of the Greasepaint - The Smell of the Crowd\". Two days later, the men's basketball team hosted its game at the arena, against the Mississippi State Bulldogs.\n\nOn November 14, 1971, Elvis Presley performed an afternoon show at the arena. He returned to the arena on June 3, 1975. The last time he performed at the arena was on August 30, 1976, a year before he died. Led Zeppelin performed a sold-out show at Memorial Coliseum on May 10, 1973, the fourth stop on their 1973 North American tour.\n\nOn May 17, 1977, American jam band the Grateful Dead played a two set (plus encore) show at the venue, their one and only appearance in Tuscaloosa.\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan visited Coleman Coliseum during his 1984 presidential re-election campaign.\n\nSince the City of Tuscaloosa does not have a municipal civic center, the demand for events grew rapidly and the Coliseum doubled its capacity in the 1970s due to this.\n\nIn the 1990s marquee concerts and events that the arena had seen in the previous two decades grew scarce as the facility became more outdated and became mostly devoted to Crimson Tide athletic events. In the hope that the University could pull more excitement for events at the facility, the Coliseum underwent a significant renovation in 2005, which cost over $24 million.\n\nColeman Coliseum is also noted for the historic Alabama-LSU basketball game that took place on February 7, 1970. LSU's Pete Maravich scored a career-high 69 points in a 106–104 loss to Alabama. Maravich came into the game against Alabama with two pulled muscles and late in the contest, he injured an ankle. Despite the injuries, LSU's senior guard scored 47 points in the second half to finish with 69, setting an NCAA record for most points against a Division I opponent. Maravich broke the record of 68 established by Niagara's Calvin Murphy 14 months earlier. Maravich completed 26 of 57 field goals (45.6 percent) and completed 17 of 21 free throws (81.0 percent). After the game, Maravich pursued a fan before being restrained. Press Maravich, LSU's coach and Pete's father, stated that the fan had hit Pete on the back. Maravich's record lasted almost 21 years, until Kevin Bradshaw of US International scored 72 against Loyola Marymount on January 5, 1991.\n\nEffective with the 2016–17 school year, Coleman Coliseum is home to both Crimson Tide basketball teams, as well as the women's gymnastics team. The women's basketball team, which played at Foster Auditorium in its first season of 1974–75, began splitting home games between the two venues the following season, and moved its entire home schedule to the Coliseum in 1981. The team returned to Foster late in the 2010–11 season, and used that venue as its regular home until returning to the Coliseum in 2016.\n\nWomen's volleyball, which also originally called Foster Auditorium home, moved to the Coliseum in 1995. In 2000, the team moved to the \"CAVE\" (Coleman Auxiliary Volleyball Extension), and it returned to Foster Auditorium in 2011.\n\nIn addition to sports, Coleman Coliseum has been used for other events including concerts (seating capacity 16,000), commencement ceremonies, alumni gatherings, student convocations, operas, ballets and political rallies. The Coliseum has been used as an annual bass tournament weigh-in spot, and a Travis Tritt music video was filmed here. The stadium hosted the NCAA Basketball Tournament three times, as a regional site in 1974 and as a sub-regional in 1975 and 1981.\n\nThe Coliseum houses the athletic department offices for all varsity sports with three exceptions. The women's basketball and volleyball offices are located at Foster Auditorium while the football offices are housed in the Mal M. Moore Athletic Facility. It features an elegant suite that serves as the President's reception area, an equipment room, weight rooms, a steam bath, a training room, food service areas, the athletic department's photo studio, and locker room for staff and the athletes.\n\nColeman is also home to the UA athletic department's ticket office.\n\nIt is recognizable on television for its \"striped\" ceiling (a result of bands of acoustical tiles) and the two scoreboards behind each end line, both of which intersperse ads, video boards and scoring information with the familiar \"R-O-L-L T-I-D-E\" in large illuminated letters. The letters formerly served as a noise meter during games, with the \"E\" in \"TIDE\" being red, as a sort of overload light. Now, all eight letters on both ends are constantly illuminated, and the final E is white, like the rest of the letters. Before the 2009-10 season, the facility underwent major renovations and these boards were removed and replaced with a center-hung scoreboard.\n\n\n"}

The building also holds offices for Kansas State Wildcats baseball, Intercollegiate Athletics, and Sports Information.\n\nThe arena is located in the northwest corner of the Kansas State campus, along with the rest of the school's athletic facilities, abutting the south end zone of Bill Snyder Family Football Stadium.\n\nThe arena was built to replace Ahearn Field House, K-State's basketball facility from 1950 to 1988. Construction of Bramlage Coliseum began with a groundbreaking on October 18, 1986, and was completed in 1988. The construction was funded entirely by student fees and donations from alumni and friends of the University.\n\nIt was named for Junction City businessman Fred Bramlage, who played a major role in raising the funds needed to build the arena.\n\nOn November 26, 1988, Kansas State University officially opened Bramlage Coliseum with an 81–77 victory over Purdue University in a rematch from the Sweet 16 of the 1988 NCAA tournament. The first basketball game actually played in the arena, however, was an NBA exhibition game between the Dallas Mavericks, led by former K-State standout Rolando Blackman, and the San Antonio Spurs on October 21, 1988.\n\nEntering the 2018-19 season, the Kansas State Wildcats men's basketball team has posted a 366–116 (.759) record in Bramlage Coliseum. Over the previous 13 seasons, the home record is 165–36 (.821).\n\nThe facility hosted women's NCAA basketball tournament games in 2002 and 2003. Kansas State played in Bramlage Coliseum in both tournament years.\n\nBramlage has also been home to the Kansas State High School Activities Association Class 2A boys and girls state championship tournaments since 1990.\n\nThe concourse around the arena is decorated with pictures of Wildcat greats and trophies won by the men's and women's teams over the years. A painted border around the top of the walls inside the Coliseum shows the years the Wildcat basketball programs won conference crowns or participated in the NCAA Tournament or NIT (WNIT). Hanging from the rafters in Bramlage are the retired numbers of former Wildcat greats including: Ernie Barrett, Rolando Blackman, Mitch Richmond, Bob Boozer, Mike Evans, Dick Knostman, Lon Kruger, Jack Parr, Chuckie Williams, Nicole Ohlde, Kendra Wecker and Shalee Lehning.\n\nThe unofficial nickname for Bramlage Coliseum is the \"Octagon of Doom\", due to the octagon shape of the arena. The nickname was popularized in the media during the 2009-2010 season, but it was first used in on-line internet forums in early 2007. K-State students bring octagonal shaped signs with \"Doom\" written on them and wear \"Doom\" T-shirts to games. \n\nBefore every game, the crowd sings Wildcat Victory, the Kansas State fight song, and then rocks back and forth to the Wabash Cannonball. This had been touted as one of the best traditions in college sports by ESPN and other Sports Broadcasting outlets. As the K-State players make their way from the locker room to the court, the crowd chants, \"Bring on the Cats, Bring on the Cats, Bring on the Cats.\" When the Cats hit the floor the crowd erupts and rises to their feet. While the opposing team's starting lineup is announced, the student section shakes newspapers, and after each name chants, \"So What\" \"Who Cares\" \"Who's He?\" \"Big Deal\" \"Go Home,\" and then rips the papers and throws them in the air at the beginning of the introduction of the Kansas State starting lineup. Each time an opposing player commits a foul the student section chants the number of fouls that player has, and every time a K-State player sinks a three-point basket, the announcer says the name of the player followed by \"for\", and then the crowd echoes \"three!\" Following a K-State victory, the crowd performs a \"K-S-U Wildcats\" chant. If an opposing team's player fouls out of the game, the crowd chants \"left, right, left\" for each step. If he stands, they chant \"standing, standing\" until the player sits down, at which time the crowd yells \"Sit down!\"\n\nSeating capacity in Bramlage was originally 13,500. Adjustments for fire codes lowered this number to 13,340 in the 2000s, and construction prior to the 2007-2008 season eliminated another approximately 800 seats to add luxury boxes and bring handicap seating up to compliance. The current capacity is 12,528.\n\n\nIn addition to Kansas State basketball, Bramlage Coliseum also hosts musical and comical performances, speeches, trade shows, and undergraduate commencement ceremonies.

The arena is home of the Wichita State Shockers men's basketball, women's basketball, and women's volleyball teams.\n\nThe arena was originally built in 1953 as the University of Wichita Field House by what was then the Municipal University of Wichita. It was considered several years ahead of its time because of its circular design, which gave nearly every fan a clear sight line and put the seats very close to the action. As a result, it was quickly nicknamed \"The Roundhouse,\" a name that has stuck to this day. When Wichita joined the state university system in 1964, the arena was renamed the WSU Field House.\n\nIn 1969, the arena was officially renamed Levitt Arena after Wichita department store magnate Henry Levitt, who had recently died. Levitt's Wichita clothing store sponsored basketball team won three consecutive national Amateur Athletic Union titles in the 1930s at a time when colleges and corporate-sponsored teams competed in the same tournament.\n\nFollowing a $6 million endowment from Charles Koch the arena underwent a $25 million renovation in 2002–03, popularly known as the \"Roundhouse Renaissance.\" The old arena concourse was completely demolished and a new one built around the original playing/seating area. A portion of the seating bowl was remodeled to make for more legroom. All new seating was installed as well as a video scoreboard, and virtually every surface that was not renovated was given a fresh coat of paint. The Shocker basketball teams played at the Kansas Coliseum for the 2002–03 season while the arena was rebuilt, while the volleyball team played at the Heskett Center on the WSU campus.\n\nIn December 2012, ESPN ranked Charles Koch Arena at number 10 in the nation in a poll on home-court advantages in College Basketball. In January 2013, ESPN's Jason King listed Koch Arena as the 7th best home court advantage in college basketball.\n\nElvis Presley gave 3 performances at the arena with the first concert there happening on June 19, 1972. The other two times were October 7, 1974 and December 27, 1976, with the latter occurring almost 7 months before his death on August 16, 1977. \n\nIt hosted the 1977 and 1989 Missouri Valley Conference men's basketball tournament title game. It also hosted games for the opening rounds of the 1981 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament.\n\nIn addition to concerts, the arena has also hosted the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus, Disney on Ice and Champions on Ice as both Levitt Arena and Koch Arena. American Idols Live! has performed annually at Koch Arena since 2003.\n\nKoch Arena hosted the 2008 Kansas State High School Activities Association Class 6A state wrestling tournament. The arena also hosts numerous high school basketball games involving schools from the Wichita City League. The KSHSAA Class 6A boys and girls basketball state tournaments moved to Koch Arena from Emporia State University's William L. White Auditorium in 2011.\n\n\n"}

He was WSU's faculty representative for athletics in the 1960s and also served as interim university For its first eight years, the venue was known as \n\nThe building used \"space frame\" construction, relatively novel at the time. The elevation of the court is approximately above sea level.\n\nThe project was approved by the WSU board of regents in early 1969. \n\nThe building's inaugural event in 1973 was the university's commencement exercises on Its first sporting event was an NBA exhibition game between Seattle and Portland on September 25, 1973. The first major concert was Three Dog Night on Friday, October 5; tickets were five dollars.\n\nThe first collegiate sporting event was a men's varsity basketball game against LSU on December 1, immediately preceded by a freshman game. The visiting Tigers were led by second-year head coach Dale Brown, previously an assistant at WSU (1971–72). Intercollegiate basketball was formerly played in Bohler Gymnasium, which opened in 1928 and is now home to Cougar volleyball.\n\nLocated on the east side of campus, the building includes the home arena for Cougars men's and women's basketball. It is named Friel Court in honor of the longtime head coach of the WSU men's basketball team, who led the Cougars to 495 victories in 30 seasons.\n\nFriel stepped down as head coach in 1958 and five years later became the first commissioner of the Big Sky Conference, originally based in Pullman (from 1963 to 1971), because that's where he lived. The court was named for Friel in late April 1977, announced by President Glenn Terrell at a meeting of the board the dedication ceremony was at halftime on \n\nThe court surface was tartan (polyurethane) for its first decade; a traditional hardwood floor debuted in the fall \n\nThe Coliseum has hosted the sub-regionals of the NCAA men's basketball tournament three times: 1975, 1982, and 1984.\n\nThe 1975 tournament had 32 teams and the sub-regional had just two games: Big Sky champion Montana and second-ranked UCLA advanced on Saturday night before 10,500. Pac-8 champion UCLA trailed Big Ten runner-up Michigan by four at halftime and needed overtime to win In the opener, WSU alumnus Jud Heathcote's Montana beat independent Utah State Five days later in the Sweet Sixteen in Portland, UCLA defeated the Grizzlies by a mere the Bruins continued on and won a tenth national title in 12 seasons, and hall of fame head coach John Wooden retired.\n\nBy 1982, the tournament had 48 teams and its Pullman sub-regional had four games with six teams, headlined by the Northwest's top two teams, fourth-ranked Oregon State and #8 Idaho Both were seeded with first-round byes and advanced: Oregon State dispatched Pepperdine and Palouse neighbor Idaho outlasted Iowa in overtime to advance to the Sweet Sixteen, with 12,340 in attendance on Sunday The next week in Provo, Utah, OSU eliminated Idaho, then was defeated by Georgetown, the eventual runner-up.\n\nThe 1984 tournament had 53 teams and six played in Pullman on the new hardwood. WSU's archrival Washington beat Nevada then upset third-seeded while eventual champion Georgetown outlasted SMU before over 10,500 spectators on Sunday \n\nWith the opening of Spokane Arena in 1995, Spokane has hosted NCAA tournament games in 2003, 2007, 2010, 2014, and 2016.\n\nThe building's full name reflects the fact that it is used not only for concerts, big-name speakers, dinners, and commencement, but also for basketball as mentioned above. The building may be reconfigured for seating capacities of 12,000 in the round to 9,000 in an end-stage configuration for concerts, to 2,500 in a theater configuration using an extensive system of fly-in curtains, an adjustable cloth scrim ceiling, and a portable proscenium stored under the floor.\n\nThe original opera house/theater configuration featured one of the first synthesized acoustical environments using surround speaker systems. An onsite reverberation chamber tuned with fiberglass panels for the specific acoustical configuration was combined with the first commercial use of a digital delay line, the Lexicon DD1, then fed to the side and overhead speakers. When properly set up, it was capable producing a very convincing acoustical rendition of a theater, an opera house, or by changing the delay settings and retuning the reverb chamber, even a cathedral. Unfortunately, a sewer drain line had been installed from the southeast corner restroom facilities through the reverb chamber, and if a toilet flushed when the system was in operation, the resulting sound effect was extraordinary. After discovering that, locking the restroom was a management priority whenever the theater was prepared for surround sound use. More recently full digital reverberation replaced the chamber.\n\nThe Coliseum's Hall of Fame—famous entertainers who have performed there—include comedians such as Bill Cosby, Jay Leno, and Whoopi Goldberg, and musical stars or shows such as The Beach Boys, The 5th Dimension, Tony Orlando and Dawn, Stevie Wonder, Bob Dylan, Elton John, Def Leppard, Metallica, Metal Church, Van Halen, Dana Carvey, Drew Carey, Montgomery Gentry, Bill Engvall, Howie Mandel, Grease & Cats. The Harlem Globetrotters have performed there five times.\n\nThe Coliseum has been the venue, for many years, for the Great Performances series, organized by Festival Dance and Performing Arts Association, of neighboring Moscow, Idaho.\n\nOverflow crowds attended lectures by Noam Chomsky on April 22, 2005, and by Jane Goodall on March 8, 2007.\n\nOn March 6, 2010, the arena hosted a WWE SmackDown house show.\n\nDue to a shortage of student housing in September 1975, the two-year-old Coliseum temporarily housed 80 men for several weeks and was dubbed the \"Cougar Hilton.\"\n\n\n"}

It housed the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong from 1 July 1997 to 6 September 2015.\n\nThe building is built on a podium due to the hilly nature of Government Hill. Originally a mansion called Johnston House, the building was altered in the 1870s and 1880s to a three-storey building. The present three-storey building opened in 1917 as the result of a major renovation, also described as an \"extensive rebuilding\", of the previous structure. The building is probably based on a previous structure near the site known as \"Beaconsfield\", but it is clad in red brick rather than an all white facade. It is constructed in granite and red bricks in Neo-Classical style, dating from the Edwardian period.\n\nThe original structure on this site dated back to 1842. The first Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Henry Pottinger resided there from 1843 to 1846. His successor, John Francis Davis also lived there for a while, before moving to Caine Road. The building likely served as one of the earlier homes of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong during this period (1843–1846). The building then had several owners, including Emanuel R. Belilios, and was occupied among others by the \"tai-pans\" of Augustine Heard and Company, a trading firm that went bankrupt in 1876. It was also used by HSBC and was home to the Russian Consulate in the 1870s. The government then leased the building from 1879 and, by 1911, the Sanitary Board and Registrar-General's offices were located in the building.\n\nIn 1915, it was acquired by the Paris Foreign Missions Society, which commissioned a major renovation. The architects were Leigh & Orange. In the process, a chapel topped by a cupola was added in the north-west corner, and the building was refaced with red bricks. It reopened in 1917 and became known as the \"French Mission Building\". In 1953, it was sold back to the Hong Kong Government.\n\nFrom 23 August 1945 to April 1946 the building was used by the provisional Government of Hong Kong following the end of Japanese occupation of Hong Kong.\n\nWhen the Communist Party expelled the Society of Jesus from Canton in 1949, it moved its St Ignatius Language School to Hong Kong where it was housed in the top floor of the building, together with accommodation for Joseph Mallin of the Society.\n\nIt was then used successively by the Education Department, the Victoria District Court (1965–1980), the Supreme Court (1980–1983), and the Government Information Services (starting from 1987). It has been used as the Court of Final Appeal since the inception of the Court at the time of the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong, on 1 July 1997. On 7 September 2015, the court moved to the Old Supreme Court Building.\n\nThe building was declared a monument on September 14, 1989. It was decided in 2011 that it would be made available for adaptive reuse after the relocation of the Court of Final Appeal to the Old Supreme Court Building.\n\n\n"}

It is home to the Virginia Tech Hokies men's and women's basketball teams.\n\nBuilt as a replacement for the much smaller War Memorial Gymnasium, the Coliseum's construction began in 1961. It was fully completed in December 1964 at a cost of $2.7 million. It was designed by Carneal and Johnston (now Ballou Justice Upton Architects, Richmond, Va) and built by T.C. Brittain and Company of Decatur, Georgia. Originally just referred to as \"the Coliseum,\" it was dedicated on September 17, 1977 to the late Stuart K. Cassell, former school business manager, first Vice President of Administration, and major supporter of the building of the arena.\n\nThe first game was on January 3, 1962 when the Hokies played Alabama. The Hokies won 91-67. Unfortunately, the crowd sat on the bare concrete risers to watch the game because the seats had not arrived.\nIn the early years of the Coliseum, the Hokies frequently saw capacity crowds pack the venue. However, student and alumni interest in basketball decreased in the 1990s due to the Hokies' lack of a stable basketball conference home (the Hokies were in three different conferences in nine seasons) and due to the success of the football team. Fan support has begun to gain momentum under coach Seth Greenberg and the school's recent move to the ACC. A raucous student section, nicknamed the \"Cassell Guard,\" has helped transform the Coliseum into a difficult venue for opposing teams in an athletic conference ripe with intimidating basketball arenas.\n\nOn June 27, 1996, a 27 year old construction worker fell to his death on the coliseum floor. Dewey Wayne Duncan, of Pulaski, VA, who was working outside the coliseum for a contractor making repairs to the roof, stepped on a section of the roof that was covered only by a ceiling tile. The tile collapsed, and Duncan fell through the roof.\n\nOn April 17, 2007, a memorial convocation was held there in response to the shootings of 32 students and faculty on the Virginia Tech campus the previous day. President George W. Bush and his wife Laura attended the event.\n\nOver the years, Cassell has undergone various updates, most recently those being a new sound system, new lights inside building over the court, as well as a refinished court.\n\nOn August 5, 2015, it was reported that Carilion Clinic has bought naming rights to the arena's court for $500,000 a year for the next 10 years. The \"Virginia Tech Carilion Court at Cassell Coliseum\" was dedicated in December 2015.\n\nOn January 10, 1983, the Virginia Tech men's basketball team defeated the number one ranked Memphis State Tigers 69-56 in front of 10,000 fans. It was the first time a number one team had played in Cassell Coliseum and the Hokies first win over a number one ranked team.\n\nOn February 17, 2005, during Virginia Tech's first season in the Atlantic Coast Conference, the Blue Devils were ranked 7th nationally. By the end of the night, the Blue Devils were handed a 67-65 loss by the Hokies in front of 9,847 fans. It was the first time that Virginia Tech had beaten Duke since 1966.\n\nOn January 13, 2007, Virginia Tech defeated the number one ranked North Carolina Tar Heels 94-88. At one point in the game, the Hokies led by 29 points. They were able to hold off a strong surge by the Tar Heels to seal the victory.\n\nOn March 22, 2010, Virginia Tech beat UConn in Cassell on national television in the second round of the NIT tournament. Trailing 63-62, the Hokies' defense pressured Connecticut into a backcourt violation. With 14.1 seconds remaining, the Hokies took the lead with a Dorenzo Hudson jump shot. The Hokies' defense was able to stop Connecticut from scoring for a 65-62 victory.\n\nOn February 26, 2011, Duke fell to Virginia Tech 64-60. At the time Duke was the number one ranked team in the country. It was Virginia Tech's fourth upset of a number one ranked team under Seth Greenberg. New York Giant, David Wilson was seen doing back flips on the court with classmate and track & field star, Nick McLaughlin following a halftime award ceremony recognizing the 2011 ACC Indoor Track and Field Champions.\n\nThe largest crowd ever at the Cassell was 11,500 for a game against Purdue on December 3, 1966.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1919737", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1919737", "title": "Séamus Ennis", "text": "Séamus Ennis\n\nSéamus Ennis (; 5 May 1919 – 5 October 1982) was an Irish musician, singer and Irish music collector. He was most noted for his uilleann pipe playing and was partly responsible for the revival of the instrument during the twentieth century, having co-founded Na Píobairí Uilleann, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the promotion of the uilleann pipes and its music. He is recognised for having preserved almost 2,000 Irish songs and dance-tunes as part of the work he did with the Irish Folklore Commission. Ennis is widely regarded as one of the greatest uilleann pipers of all time.\n\nJames Ennis, Séamus's father, worked as a civil servant in Naul, County Dublin. In 1908, James Ennis was in a pawn-shop in London. He bought a bag containing the pieces of a set of old uilleann pipes. They were made in the mid nineteenth century by Coyne Pipemakers of Thomas Street in Dublin. In 1912, he came first in the Oireachtas competition for warpipes and second in the uilleann pipes. He was also a prize-winning dancer. In 1916, he married Mary Josephine McCabe, an accomplished fiddle player from County Monaghan. They had six children, Angela, Séamus, Barbara, and twins, Cormac and Ursula (Pixie) and Desmond. Séamus was born on 5 May 1919 in Jamestown in Finglas, North Dublin City. James Ennis was a member of the Fingal trio, which included Frank O'Higgins on fiddle and John Cawley on flute and performed regularly with them on the radio. At the age of thirteen, Séamus started receiving lessons on the pipes from his father. He attended a Gaelscoil, Cholmcille, and a Gaelcholáiste, Coláiste Mhuire, which gave him a knowledge of the Irish language that would serve him well in later life. He sat an exam to become Employment Exchange clerk but was too far down the list to be offered a job. He was twenty and unemployed.\n\nColm Ó Lochlainn was editor of \"Irish Street Ballads\" and a friend of the Ennis family. In 1938 Séamus confided in Colm that he intended to move to England to join the British Army. Colm immediately offered him a job at The Three Candles Press. There Séamus learned all aspects of the printing trade. This included writing down slow airs for printed scores – a skill which later proved important. Colm was director of an Irish language choir, An Claisceadal, which Séamus joined. In 1942, during The Emergency, shortages and rationing meant that things became difficult in the printing trade. Professor Seamus Ó Duilearge of the Irish Folklore Commission hired the 23-year-old to collect songs. He was given \"pen, paper and pushbike\" and a salary of three pounds per week. Off he went to Connemara.\n\nFrom 1942 to 1947, working for the Irish Folklore Commission, Séamus collected songs in West Munster, Galway, Cavan, Mayo, Donegal, Kerry, the Aran Islands and the Scottish Hebrides. His knowledge of Scots Gaelic enabled him to transcribe much of the John Lorne Campbell collection of songs. Elizabeth Cronin of Baile Mhuirne, County Cork was so keen to chat to Séamus on his visits that she wrote down her own songs and handed them over as he arrived, and then got down to conversation. He had a natural empathy with the musicians and singers he met. In August 1947 he started work as an outside broadcast officer with Raidió Éireann. He was a presenter and recorded Willie Clancy, Sean Reid and Micho Russell for the first time. There was an air of authority in his voice. In 1951, Alan Lomax and Jean Ritchie arrived from America to record Irish songs and tunes. The tables were turned as Séamus became the subject of someone else's collection. There is a photograph from 1952/53 showing Jean huddled over the tape recorder while Séamus plays Uilleann pipes.\n\nLate in 1951, he joined the BBC. He moved to London to work with producer Brian George. In 1952 he married Margaret Glynn. They had two children, Catherine and Christopher. His job was to record the traditional music of England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland and to present it on the BBC Home Service. The programme was called \"As I Roved Out\" and ran until 1958. Meeting up with Alan Lomax again, Séamus was largely responsible for the album \"Folk and Primitive Music\" (volume on Ireland) on the Columbia label.\n\nIn 1958, after his contract with the BBC was not renewed, he started doing freelance work, first in England then back in Ireland, with the new TV station Teilifis Éireann. Soon he was relying totally on his musical ability to make a living. About this time his marriage broke down and he returned to Ireland. He suffered from tuberculosis and was ill for some time. In 1964, he performed at the Newport Folk Festival. His father gave him the pipes he had bought in 1908. Although most pipers can be classed as playing in a tight style or an open style, Séamus was in between. Séamus was a master of the slow air, knowing how to decorate long notes with taste and discreet variation.\n\nTwo events will live in legend among pipers. The first was in Bettystown in 1968, when the society of Irish pipers, Na Píobairí Uilleann, was formed. Breandán Breathnach was playing a tape of his own piping. Séamus asked \"What year?\" Brendan replied \"1948\". Séamus said \"So I thought\". For a couple of hours the younger players performed while Séamus sat in silence. Eventually he was asked to play. Slowly he took off his coat and rolled up his sleeves. He spent 20 minutes tuning up his 130-year-old pipes. He then asked the gathering whether all the tape recorders were ready and proceeded to play for over an hour. To everyone's astonishment he then offered his precious pipes to Willie Clancy to play a set. Willie demurred but eventually gave in. Next Liam O'Flynn (Liam Óg Ó Floinn) was asked to play them, and so on, round the room. The second unforgettable session was in Dowlings' pub in Prosperous in County Kildare. Christy Moore was there, as well as most of the future members of Planxty.\n\nSéamus never ran any school of piping but his enthusiasm infused everyone he met. In the early seventies, he shared a house with Liam O'Flynn for almost three years. Finally he bought a piece of land in Naul and lived in a mobile home there. One of his last performances was at the Willie Clancy Summer School in 1982. He died on 5 October 1982. His pipes were bequeathed to Liam O'Flynn. Radio producer Peter Browne produced a compilation of his performances, called \"The Return from Fingal\", spanning 40 years.\n\nSéamus Ennis Road in his native Finglas is named in his honour. The Séamus Ennis Cultural Centre in Naul is additionally named after him. He is also the subject of Christy Moore's song 'The Easter Snow.' This is the title of a slow air Ennis used to play, and one after which he named his final home in Naul.\n\n\n\nIn 2009 \"The Blackbird\" from \"The Wandering Minstrel\" was included in Topic Records 70 year anniversary boxed set \"Three Score and Ten\" as track eight on the third CD.\n\n\n"}

It has also hosted Cleveland Cavaliers preseason games since 2014.\n\nOn November 2, 2014, Xavier gave nearby Mount St. Joseph University free use of the arena for the school's women's basketball game with Hiram College. The game had been rescheduled, with NCAA approval, to allow terminally ill Mount St. Joseph player Lauren Hill to play in a college game. The game also served as a charity fundraiser for research into diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, the brain cancer from which Hill was suffering. On April 13, 2015, the arena hosted a public memorial service for Hill following her death three days earlier. Later that year, the two schools launched the Lauren Hill Tipoff Classic, an annual season-opening event featuring both schools' women's teams, at the arena.\n\nWithin the main arena are 22 luxury boxes as well as the Joseph Club, a VIP bar overlooking the court. A practice facility, the Kohlhepp Family Auxiliary Gym, is attached to the arena and is used by the athletic teams, as well as being used as additional event space when needed. There are also state-of-the-art weight and training rooms as well as 4 large locker rooms. There is a media room that is used as a work room and for press conferences.

A new, 10mm centerhung Mitsubishi DiamondVision video board was installed along with 16.5mm LSI/SACO scoring panels, a 360° ring and almost 600' of LED fascia ribbon board. An auxiliary scoreboard was also installed on the north wall of the arena. The luxury suites and Joseph Club were also renovated. Following the 2016 season, the basketball floor was updated to remove the skyline.\n\nAs a concert venue Cintas Center can seat as few as 2,000 or as many as 10,000. The arena features of space.

The arena is directly adjacent to Alumni, with some luxury boxes overlooking both the football field and arena floors.\n\nConte Forum seats 8,606 spectators in its basketball configuration and 7,884 when set up for hockey. The facility also houses 950-seat Power Gym which is used for BC volleyball games and as an auxiliary basketball court.\n\nAs the largest indoor venue on the BC campus, Conte Forum hosts larger university-related events including conferences and debates. It is the site of the annual \"Pops-on-the-Heights\" during the annual Parents' Weekend in the fall, a gala concert featuring the Boston Pops Orchestra which raises over $1.5 million for BC's academic scholarship fund. In the event of inclement weather, Conte Forum also hosts the university's commencement exercises.\n\nSince 2008, Conte Forum has also hosted the Boston College AHANA Leadership Council (ALC) Showdown in the spring, an increasingly popular dance competition between BC's various dance and cultural organizations. Conte has also hosted numerous concerts, including in recent years Akon, Third Eye Blind, hellogoodbye, The Roots, Kanye West, and The Academy Is, as well as Will Ferrell's Funny or Die Comedy Tour.\n\nOn January 5, 2014, the Conte Forum was the venue for Boston mayor Marty Walsh's inauguration.\n\nIn Boston's proposed bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics, Conte Forum was selected as a potential venue for various events, such as Wrestling and Judo. However, the city eventually withdrew the bid.\n\n\n"}

Opened in 1979, it is home to the Colorado Buffaloes men's and women's basketball teams and women's volleyball of the Pac-12 Conference.\n\nThe building is an eight-sided concrete structure, with three levels: arena floor, service level, and the concourse level. Single-tiered inside, it replaced the Balch Fieldhouse, the current home of the indoor track and field team located directly adjacent to Folsom Field. The approximate elevation at street level is above sea level.\n\nThe venue was initially called the CU Events/Conference Center and was renamed to the Coors Events/Conference Center in September 1990 after the Coors family, in recognition of a $5 million gift from the Adolph Coors Foundation. In 2008 with the addition of the basketball offices to the building on the service level, the \"Conference\" was removed from the name as there were no longer conference rooms in the building. Although the naming agreement with the Coors Foundation had long expired, the Coors name remained on the building until 2018, when it was renamed the CU Events Center. At the time, the CU athletic department announced it was actively seeking a new naming rights partner.\n\nOn December 9, 1981, the Grateful Dead played their last Boulder show at the then-named \"CUC.\"\n\nIt is the highest indoor arena in the Pac-12 Conference, approximately above the Huntsman Center \n\nThe most dramatic changes since the building has been opened have come since 2008. After the 2007-08 basketball seasons, the CEC underwent a $200,000 \"Floor Lift\" with a permanent maple surface was installed that has technology to reduce injuries and fatigue.\n\nIn April 2008, the men's and women's basketball offices were relocated to the CEC from Folsom Field second level where the conference rooms were previously located.\n\nIn the summer of 2010, two new video boards were installed in the southwest and northeast corners. With the new video boards and as part of the new practice facility, a new state-of-the-art production facility was built for the department's award-winning BuffVision office. The production room controls the video boards at both the Coors Events Center and Folsom Field.\n\nA new practice facility was opened in August 2011 for volleyball and basketball. The building was just the second athletic facility in the nation and third on CU's campus to earn LEED Platinum Certification, the highest possible by the internationally recognized system developed by the U.S. Green Building Council.\n\nIn August 2013, a video room for the men's and women's basketball teams was opened for the first time, giving both teams additional meeting space and the ability to watch film more efficiently.\n\nIn February 2014, a new weight room was finished in the remaining space on the second level where the conference rooms were once located, adjacent to the basketball offices that were relocated in 2008.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1919754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1919754", "title": "Low (Testament album)", "text": "Low (Testament album)\n\nLow is the sixth studio album by American thrash metal band Testament. It was released on October 4, 1994. It was the first Testament release not to feature two of its primary lineup members Alex Skolnick (lead guitar) and Louie Clemente (drums). On September 29, 2017, Metal Blade Records released the album on vinyl for the first time in the US along with the previous album \"The Ritual\", limited to 1500 copies.\n\n\"Low\" would be Testament's last album with Atlantic Records, leading group members to create their own label Burnt Offerings Inc. as part of the change.\n\nThe record was recorded with primary band members Eric Peterson (rhythm guitar), Greg Christian (bass), and Chuck Billy (vocals). It also saw the first of two Testament album appearances by artist John Tempesta (drums), and three for artist James Murphy (guitar). Long time Testament collaborator Del James is given composer and vocal credits on the album. Additionally, a music video was filmed for the title track.\n\n\"Low\" is dedicated to Savatage guitarist Criss Oliva, who died while Testament was working on the album, and is thanked in the liner notes (\"may Criss rest in peace\"). Alex Skolnick, who had left Testament two years earlier, briefly replaced Oliva when Savatage was recording their eighth studio album \"Handful of Rain\", which was released a month before \"Low\".\n\nAlbum cover artwork for \"Low\" was designed by Dave McKean. He would go on to do the next two Testament studio album covers \"Demonic\" (1997) and \"The Gathering\" (1999).\n\nReviews for \"Low\" have generally been mixed. AllMusic's John Franck awards the album four stars out of five, and states, \"Testament's sixth studio album literally saw the boys from the Bay Area fighting for their lives in the unfriendly surroundings of the alternative nation. Wisely, the band decided to try something completely different and join forces with Rage Against the Machine/Melvins producer GGGarth Richardson. With temporary drummer John Tempesta in place behind the skins, the band began tracking at A&M studios in Los Angeles. Wanting to return to the no-holds-barred yet musically challenging sounds of works past, the GGGarth teaming proved to be the perfect fodder necessary for Testament to regain their confidence.\"\n\n\"Low\" failed to match the critical or popular acclaim of Testament's previous albums, peaking at #122 on the \"Billboard\" 200, the band's second lowest chart position after 1988's \"The New Order\", which debuted at #136. \"Low\" and \"Dog Faced Gods\" were released as singles to promote the album, but did not chart. However, \"Low\" and the cover version of Scorpions' \"Sails of Charon\" (which appears as a B-side of \"Dog Faced Gods\") received regular airplay on modern rock stations, the most notable being KNAC.\n\nIn July 2014, \"Guitar World\" placed \"Low\" at number 40 in their \"Superunknown: 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994\" list.\n\n"}
{"id": "1919755", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1919755", "title": "Piracy Funds Terrorism", "text": "Piracy Funds Terrorism\n\nPiracy Funds Terrorism Volume 1, usually referred to simply as Piracy Funds Terrorism, is a mixtape produced by British-Sri Lankan recording artist M.I.A. and American DJ Diplo featuring vocal tracks intended for M.I.A.'s debut album \"Arular\" mashed up with samples of other recordings. The mixtape was produced by the two artists at Diplo's home studio in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was not officially released, but was distributed at M.I.A.'s live shows and via the internet to promote the release of her much-delayed debut album. Despite its unofficial status, the mixtape received general acclaim among critics. Several music publications included the mixtape in their listings of the best albums of 2004.\n\nRecording sessions for \"Arular\", the debut album by M.I.A., took place during 2003 and 2004, and the album was originally scheduled to be released in September 2004. Legal issues relating to the use of samples delayed this release, however, first to December and then into 2005. During the recording process, M.I.A. met DJ Diplo, and expressed an interest in working with him on a track for the album. Although their initial recording sessions together proved fruitless, Diplo conceived the idea of using the existing vocal tracks recorded for the album to produce a mixtape which could be used to promote the delayed full-length album. M.I.A. extended her stay in the United States and the two artists produced the mixtape at his home studio.\n\nThe mixtape includes early mixes of the vocals intended for \"Arular\", mashed up with samples of tracks including \"Walk Like an Egyptian\" by The Bangles, \"Big Pimpin'\" by Jay-Z and \"Push It\" by Salt-n-Pepa. Tunes by Baby, dead Prez, Missy Elliott, Ciara, LL Cool J and Cutty Ranks are also included. Necessary legal clearance for the use of these samples was not obtained, with the result that the mixtape could not be sold in record shops and could only be distributed by word of mouth. In addition to pop and hip hop, global music styles are included in the mix. The track \"Galang\" incorporates elements of reggaeton, and three tracks consist of Brazilian baile funk.\n\nThe cover features a photograph of M.I.A. wearing a T-shirt with the slogan \"Complaints Department\" placed above a picture of a hand grenade. Arranged around the title are a series of smaller pictures depicting dancers, rioters and riot police. According to Diplo, the pressing was handled by a \"little storefront-house\" which specialises in producing mixtapes.\n\nAn initial pressing of 1,000 copies of the mixtape was produced and given to M.I.A.'s record label. The label began sending the copies out as promotional recordings, prompting Diplo to ask for the remaining copies to be returned so that he could distribute them at shows and in clubs, which he felt was a more appropriate method of distribution for the mixtape. He stated that around 2,000 copies of the recording were produced in total.\n\nThe mixtape received general acclaim among music critics, despite not being an official release. In a review for \"The Village Voice\", Robert Christgau said he was more interested in hearing M.I.A.'s own original music than a mashup: \"I find more fascination—and pleasure, if not variety—in M.I.A. juxtaposed against herself than in, for instance, favela funk juxtaposed against 'Walk Like an Egyptian'. Which isn't to deny I also find all these good things in favela funk juxtaposed against 'Walk Like an Egyptian'.\" Rollie Pemberton from \"Stylus Magazine\" called \"Piracy Funds Terrorism\" \"a genre-bending adventure in shattered preconceptions and club killing beats\" and said that, based on the strength of the mixtape, M.I.A.'s first official album had a lot to live up to. \"Village Voice\" critic Tom Breihan later expressed relief that M.I.A.'s aesthetic and her debut album did not have much input from Diplo. \n\n\"Piracy Funds Terrorism\" was voted the 23rd best album of 2004 in the Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics nationwide, published by \"The Village Voice\". \"Pitchfork\" ranked it at number 12 on their year-end albums list, and later at number 103 on their decade-end list of top 200 albums from the 2000s.\n\nThe first pressing of \"Piracy Funds Terrorism\" had an incorrect track listing, which was fixed for the second pressing, the track listing for which is as follows:\n\nFor the third pressing, two tracks featuring beats created by Cavemen were replaced with new material due to legal issues.\n\nThe only credits on the cover are as follows:\n"}

{"id": "1919759", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1919759", "title": "Jack Harkness", "text": "Jack Harkness\n\nCaptain Jack Harkness is a fictional character played by John Barrowman in \"Doctor Who\" and its spin-off series, \"Torchwood\". The character first appears in the 2005 \"Doctor Who\" episode \"The Empty Child\" and subsequently features in the remaining episodes of the first series (2005) as a companion to the series' protagonist, The Doctor. Subsequent to this, Jack became the central character in the adult-themed \"Torchwood\", which aired from 2006 to 2011. Barrowman reprised the role for guest appearances in \"Doctor Who\" in its third and fourth series, the two-part special \"The End of Time\" and returned in the twelfth series episode \"Fugitive of the Judoon\".\n\nIn contrast to The Doctor, Jack is more of a conventional action hero, as well as outwardly flirtatious and capable of acts which The Doctor would view as less than noble. In the programme's narrative, Jack begins as a time traveller and former con man from the 51st century, who comes to travel with the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) and his companion Rose Tyler (Billie Piper). As a consequence of his death and resurrection in the Series 1 finale, \"The Parting of the Ways\", Jack becomes immortal and is stranded on 19th-century Earth. There he becomes a member of Torchwood, a British organization dedicated to combating alien threats. He spends over a century waiting to reunite with the Doctor, over which time he becomes Torchwood's leader. Eventually, he reunites with the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) for several appearances in \"Doctor Who\". Aspects of the character's backstory—both prior to meeting The Doctor, and during his many decades living on Earth—are gradually revealed over \"Torchwood\" (and to a lesser extent, \"Doctor Who\") through the use of flashback scenes and expository dialogue.\n\nJack was the first openly non-heterosexual character in the history of televised \"Doctor Who\". The popularity of the character amongst multiple audiences directly influenced the development of the spin-off series \"Torchwood\". The character became a figure of the British public consciousness, rapidly gaining fame for actor Barrowman. As an ongoing depiction of bisexuality in mainstream British television, the character became a role model for young gay and bisexual people in the UK. Jack is featured in various \"Doctor Who\" and \"Torchwood\" books and has action figures created in his likeness.\n\nJack Harkness first appeared in the 2005 \"Doctor Who\" two-part story, \"The Empty Child\" and \"The Doctor Dances\", when Rose Tyler (Billie Piper), a companion of the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston), meets him during the London Blitz. Although posing as an American volunteering in the Royal Air Force, Jack is actually a former \"Time Agent\" from the 51st century who left the agency after inexplicably losing two years of his memory. Now working as a con man, Jack is responsible for unwittingly releasing a plague in London in 1941. After The Doctor cures the plague, Jack redeems himself by taking an unexploded bomb into his ship; The Doctor and Rose rescue him moments before it explodes. He subsequently travels with The Doctor and Rose in The Doctor's time traveling spacecraft, the TARDIS. During his time with The Doctor, Jack matures into a hero, and in his final 2005 appearance, he sacrifices himself fighting the evil alien Daleks. Rose brings him back to life while suffused with the power of the time vortex, but when the power leaves her she doesn't remember doing it. She and The Doctor subsequently leave Jack behind on Satellite 5.\n\nJack returned in 2006 as a character of the spin-off series \"Torchwood\", in which he is a member of the Cardiff-based Torchwood Three in combating alien threats and monitoring a spacetime rift which runs through Cardiff. Jack is re-introduced as a changed man, reluctantly immortal, having spent years on Earth waiting to reunite with The Doctor. Jack recruits policewoman Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) to the team of experts after she discovers them; there are hints of romantic feelings between the two, but Gwen has a boyfriend and Jack enters a sexual relationship with the team's general \"factotum\" Ianto Jones (Gareth David-Lloyd). Despite having worked with him for some time, his present-day colleagues know very little about him; over the course of the series they discover that he cannot die. Jack was once a prisoner of war, and was an interrogator who used torture. In the \"Torchwood\" Series 1 finale \"End of Days\", Jack returns to the TARDIS. This immediately leads into the 2007 \"Doctor Who\" episode \"Utopia\", where he joins the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) and his companion Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman). Jack explains he returned from Satellite 5 to the present day by traveling to 1869 via vortex manipulator, and lived through the 20th century waiting for The Doctor. By the series finale, having spent a year in an alternate timeline enslaved by The Master (John Simm), Jack opts to return to his team in Cardiff. Before departing, Jack speculates about his immortality and reminisces about his youth on the Boeshane Peninsula, revealing that his nickname had been the \"Face of Boe\", suggesting that he may one day become the non-humanoid recurring character of the same name, voiced by Struan Rodger.\n\nIn \"Torchwood\"'s second series (2008), Jack returns with a lighter attitude, and finds his team have continued working in his absence. They are also more insistent to learn of his past, especially after meeting his former partner, the unscrupulous Captain John Hart (James Marsters). The episode \"Adam\" explores Jack's childhood in the Boeshane Peninsula, revealing through flashback sequences how his father Franklin (Demetri Goritsas) died and young Jack (Jack Montgomery) lost his younger brother Gray (Ethan Brooke) during an alien invasion. Flashbacks in the series' penultimate episode \"Fragments\" depict Jack's capture by Torchwood in the late 19th century. Initially their prisoner, Jack is coerced into becoming a freelance agent for the organization, and eventually becomes leader of Torchwood Three at midnight on 1 January 2000. The series finale features the return of Captain John and Jack's brother Gray (Lachlan Nieboer), who, after a lifetime of torture by aliens, wants revenge on Jack. While Jack manages to repair his friendship with Captain John to some degree, he is forced to place his brother in cryogenic stasis after Gray kills his teammates Toshiko Sato (Naoko Mori) and Owen Harper (Burn Gorman). Jack subsequently appears alongside the casts of \"Torchwood\" and \"The Sarah Jane Adventures\" in the two-part crossover finale of the 2008 \"Doctor Who\" series, \"The Stolen Earth\" and \"Journey's End\". Jack is summoned along with other former companions of The Doctor to assist him in defeating the mad scientist Davros (Julian Bleach) and his creation, the Daleks. Jack parts company from the Doctor once again, having helped save the universe from destruction.\n\n\"Torchwood\"'s third series (2009) is a five-part serial entitled \"Children of Earth\". Aliens known as the 4-5-6 announce they are coming to Earth. Civil servant John Frobisher (Peter Capaldi) orders the destruction of Torchwood to cover a conspiracy; in 1965, the British government had authorized Jack to sacrifice twelve children to the 4-5-6, which is shown in flashbacks. Jack is blown apart in an explosion, but painfully reconstitutes from an incomplete pile of body parts; Gwen and Ianto escape and later rescue Jack from a concrete grave. Jack's daughter Alice (Lucy Cohu) and grandson Steven (Bear McCausland) are taken into custody by the assassins. The 4-5-6 demand ten percent of the world's children. Although he handed over twelve children in 1965, Jack refuses to give up any this time around. The 4-5-6 release a fatal virus; Ianto dies in Jack's arms. To create the signal that will destroy the 4-5-6, Jack sacrifices Steven. Six months later, having lost his lover, his grandson and his daughter, he bids farewell to Gwen and is transported aboard an alien ship to leave Earth for parts unknown. In the closing scenes of 2010 \"Doctor Who\" special \"The End of Time\", the critically injured Doctor gives each companion a farewell before his impending regeneration. Finding Jack in an exotic alien bar, he leaves him a note containing the name of \"Titanic\" crew member Alonso Frame (Russell Tovey), sitting on Jack's left side; the two proceed to flirt.\n\nThe fourth series, \"\" (2011), an American co-production, sees Jack return to Earth to investigate a phenomenon where humans can no longer die; Jack discovers that he has become mortal. Investigating their connection to the so-called \"miracle\", CIA agent Rex Matheson (Mekhi Phifer) renditions Jack and Gwen to America, but joins the team along with CIA colleague Esther Drummond (Alexa Havins) after conspirators within the CIA betray them. Jack's investigations into the miracle repeatedly turn up dead-ends, indicating a decades-old conspiracy to manipulate the global economy, as well as political institutions, for unknown purposes. Flashbacks in \"Immortal Sins\" depict Jack's relationship with Italian thief Angelo Colasanto (Daniele Favilli) in late 1920s New York City, ending in heartbreak after Jack is killed, bled and tortured repeatedly by the local community. In the present day, Angelo's granddaughter Olivia (Nana Visitor) explains that the descendants of three local businessmen who wished to purchase Jack's powers—\"the Three Families\"—are responsible for the miracle, using Jack's blood in conjunction with what they call \"the Blessing\". In \"The Gathering\", the team ultimately track down the Families and the Blessing, which is revealed to be an antipodal geological formation connected to the Earth's morphic field running from Shanghai and Buenos Aires; the team divide, attempting to reach both access points. To end the miracle, in \"The Blood Line\", Jack has Gwen kill him so that his mortal blood can reset the human morphic field; Gwen kills him with a bullet through the chest, while Rex—who transfused himself with Jack's blood to keep it safe—allows the Blessing to drain him too, in Buenos Aires. Rex survives, and with the morphic field restored, Jack resurrects. At Esther's funeral however, they discover that Rex has acquired self-healing abilities just like Jack's.\n\nAfter a ten-year absence from the show, Jack returned in the twelfth series of \"Doctor Who\" in the episode \"Fugitive of the Judoon\" (2020), where he attempts to contact the Doctor (Jodie Whittaker). Using a stolen alien craft, he transports the Doctor's companions Graham O'Brien (Bradley Walsh), Ryan Sinclair (Tosin Cole) and Yasmin Khan (Mandip Gill), mistaking each of them for the Doctor. Learning of their identity and the Doctor's recent regeneration into a woman, he returns them to Earth, passing them a warning to give to the Doctor about the \"lone Cyberman\", before he teleports away after the ship's onboard nanogenes attack him.\n\nJack features in the BBC Books \"New Series Adventures\" \"Doctor Who\" novels \"The Deviant Strain\", \"The Stealers of Dreams\", and \"Only Human\". These novels take place between episodes of the 2005 series of \"Doctor Who\". In \"The Stealers of Dreams\", Jack refers to the Face of Boe as a famous figure in his home era; the producers of the series had not conceptualized the possibility of a Jack and Boe connection until mid-way into the production of the 2007 series.\n\nThe first wave of BBC Books \"Torchwood\" novels, \"Another Life\", \"Border Princes\", and \"Slow Decay\" (published January 2007), are set between episodes of the first series of \"Torchwood\". The novels \"Trace Memory\", \"The Twilight Streets\", and \"Something in the Water\" (published March 2008), are set during the concurrently airing second series of \"Torchwood\". \"The Twilight Streets\" suggests Jack was a freelance Torchwood agent in the 1940s, who disagreed with their methods but was persuaded by the love of an ex-boyfriend, Greg. The novel also explained that during the events of the \"Doctor Who\" episode \"Boom Town\" (which was set in Cardiff), Jack placed a lockdown on Torchwood activity so as not to create a paradox involving his past self. \"Trace Memory\" similarly depicts Jack as a freelance Torchwood agent, living and working in the late 1960s. \"Pack Animals\", \"SkyPoint\", and \"Almost Perfect\" (October 2008), are made up of more second series adventures, apart from \"Almost Perfect\" which is set after Series Two finale \"Exit Wounds\". \"Into the Silence\", \"Bay of the Dead\", and \"The House that Jack Built\" (May 2009), similarly are set between the second and third series of the show. \"The House that Jack Built\" focuses partly on Jack's life in 1906. \"Risk Assessment\", \"The Undertaker's Gift\", and \"Consequences\" (October 2009), are likewise set between \"Exit Wounds\" and \"Children of Earth\".\n\n\"The Torchwood Archives\", published after the second series in 2008, is a companion book written by Gary Russell which gives an \"insider's look\" into the life of Jack and the Torchwood team. The book collects and re-publishes ancillary material which appeared on the \"Torchwood\" website in the first two seasons, and provides new material such as rough dates for things like Jack's marriage as relayed by the book's fictional narrator. The book is composed of fictitious archive notes, personnel forms, photographs, newspaper clippings and staff memos, and offers revelations about the character which would later be confirmed by the television series. For example, \"Archives\" first mention Jack's lover Lucia Moretti, who is mentioned in \"Children of Earth\". In a similar vein to \"The Torchwood Archives\" but from a real-world perspective, Gary Russell's \"The Torchwood Encyclopedia\" (2009) expands on \"every fact and figure\" for Jack and the Torchwood world.\n\nThe character is also mentioned Dave Stone's 2006 Judge Dredd novel \"Psykogeddon\", where a Mega-City News announcer relays a disclaimer from pornographer Jason Kane – a character Stone created for the 1996 \"Doctor Who\" novel \"Death and Diplomacy\" – stating that any similarity between Kane and \"the notorious Cursed Earth brigand 'Captain' Jack Harkness is a purely unfortunate coincidence\".\n\nDuring the first series of \"Torchwood\", the \"Torchwood\" website, located at torchwood.org.uk, recounted some adventures by Captain Jack through an alternate reality game made up of electronic literature in the form of fictional intercepted blogs, newspaper cutouts and confidential letters and IM conversations between members of the Torchwood Three crew. Written by James Goss, the first series' website sheds some light on Jack's backstory in the years he worked for \"Torchwood\". For the second series in 2008, a second interactive \"Torchwood\" online game was devised, scripted by series writer Phil Ford, and as with the 2006 website contained some information on Jack's unseen adventures. The BBC America \"Torchwood\" also has a 'Captain's Blog' section which relays Jack's accounts of the events of each episode. \"The Torchwood Archives\" by Gary Russell collects much of this online literature for the first two series in hardback form, including the Captain's Blog section of the BBC America website.\n\nDuring Series Four of \"Doctor Who\", the BBC's website also included a section called \"Captain Jack's Monster Files\" featuring weekly webcast videos narrated by John Barrowman in character as Captain Jack giving \"top secret\" facts collected by Torchwood about \"Doctor Who\" monsters, such as the Slitheen. A Christmas special 2008 Monster File features Barrowman in new footage as Jack, as does the Cybermen edition added following the airing of \"The Next Doctor\" on Christmas Day. For Dr Fiona Hobden, the Monster Files' mock-documentary format give an \"additional twist\" to the interplay between history and fiction. Because Captain Jack narrates, \"the story unfolds in the tradition of contemporary historical documentary, the docudrama\"; in the Monster File for \"The Fires of Pompeii\", Harkness' commentary moves the 'reality' of the episode away from the explosion of Vesuvius and the human experience, and to the story itself. From Series Five onwards, the Monster Files are instead presented by River Song (Alex Kingston).\n\nJack also appears in the web-based motion comic series \"Torchwood: Web of Lies\" (2011), which ties into \"Miracle Day\". The story depicts a series two-set adventure where Jack is kidnapped by unknown assailants and pursued by Gwen. Investigations by a woman named Holly (voice of Eliza Dushku) establish that Jack was kidnapped by the Three Families so they could acquire entire vats of his blood, which she destroys.\n\nIn addition to the paperback novels, Jack also appears in \"Torchwood\" audio books, the first four being \"Hidden\" written by Steven Savile and narrated by Naoko Mori, \"Everyone Says Hello\" written by Dan Abnett and narrated by Burn Gorman, released February 2008, \"In the Shadows\" by Joseph Lidster and narrated by Eve Myles, released September 2008, and \"The Sin Eaters\" written by Brian Minchin and narrated by Gareth David-Lloyd, released September 2008. Joseph Lidster also wrote a BBC Radio 4 \"Torchwood\" drama, \"Lost Souls\" which aired in Summer 2008 as an Afternoon Play featuring the voices of John Barrowman, Eve Myles, Gareth David-Lloyd and Freema Agyeman. Set after the events of the 2008 series, Jack and his team make their first international adventure to CERN in Geneva, as part of Radio 4's special celebration of the Large Hadron Collider being switched on. The special radio episode's plot focuses on the Large Hadron Collider's activation and the doomsday scenario some predicted it might incite, as well as the team's mourning of Toshiko and Owen's recent deaths.\nBetween 1 and 3 July, Radio 4 aired three further audio dramas in \"The Afternoon Play\" slot, bridging the gap between Series 2 and 3. \"Golden Age\" introduced Jack's ex-lover Duchess Eleanor (Jasmine Hyde), the leader of Torchwood India, which Jack closed down in 1924. \"The Dead Line\" features another ex-girlfriend of Jack's, Stella Courtney (Doña Croll).\n\n2011 audio drama series \"The Lost Files\" was released to tie in with \"Miracle Day\". \"The Devil and Miss Carew\" and \"Submission\" are set in the same period as the previous audio dramas. \"House of the Dead\", however, reveals itself in its final act to be set six months after Ianto's death; Jack visited the House of the Dead to make contact with Ianto, who is unaware that he is dead. Jack and Ianto say a final goodbye and tell each other they love one another for the first time. Jack attempts to return to the land of the living alongside Ianto, but Ianto stays behind to close the Cardiff spacetime rift forever with Jack's device.\n\nIn 2015, BBC Worldwide granted Big Finish Productions the licence to produce \"Torchwood\" audio plays, including new stories set in Cardiff following \"Miracle Day\". As of April 2018, Barrowman has reprised his role of Harkness in eleven releases.\n\nIn 2017, Big Finish Productions released \"The Lives of Captain Jack\" audio series, containing four plays depicting encounters from Jack's life. These cover the year he spent on a devastated Earth, following \"The Parting of the Ways\"; his romantic encounter with Alonso Frame, following \"The End of Time\"; an adventure he shared with Jackie Tyler (Camille Coduri), during the time he waited on Earth for the Doctor to return; and a story from his days as a Time Agent and before he took the name Jack. The final story of this collection, \"Month 25\", reveals Jack's backstory with the Time Agency, detailing how he lost two years of his memories, and revealing his real name: Javic Piotr Thane.\n\n In naming the character, executive producer and head writer Russell T Davies drew inspiration from the Marvel Comics character Agatha Harkness, a character whose surname Davies had previously used in naming lead characters in \"Century Falls\" and \"The Grand\". Davies states that reusing names (such as Tyler, Smith, Harper, Harkness and Jones) allows him to get a grip of the character on the blank page. Jack's original appearances in \"Doctor Who\" were conceived with the intention of forming a character arc in which Jack is transformed from a coward to a hero, and John Barrowman consciously minded this in his portrayal of the character. Following on that arc, the character's debut episode would leave his morality as ambiguous, publicity materials asking, \"Is he a force for good or ill?\"\nActor John Barrowman himself was a key factor in the conception of Captain Jack. Barrowman says that at the time of his initial casting, Davies and co-executive producer, Julie Gardner had explained to him that they \"basically wrote the character around [John]\". Davies had singled out Barrowman for the part. On meeting him, Barrowman tried out the character using his native Scottish accent, his normal American accent, and an English accent; Davies decided it \"made it bigger if it was an American accent\". Barrowman recounts Davies as having been searching for an actor with a \"matinée idol quality\", telling him that \"the only one in the whole of Britain who could do it was you\". A number of television critics have compared Barrowman's performances as Captain Jack to those of Hollywood actor Tom Cruise.\n\nThe character's introduction served to posit him as a secondary hero and a rival to the series protagonist, the Doctor, simultaneously paralleling the Doctor's detached alien nature with Jack's humanity and \"heart\". John Barrowman describes the character in his initial appearance as \"an intergalactic conman\" and also a \"rogue Time Agent\" which he defines as \"part of a kind of space CIA\" and alludes to the moral ambiguity of having \"done something in his past\" and not knowing \"whether it is good or bad because his memory has been erased\". Writer Stephen James Walker notes similarities have been found between Jack and Angel (David Boreanaz), the heroic vampire from America's \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" and \"Angel\"; Alan Stanley Blair of SyFy Portal pointed out that \"Back alley fights, knowledge of the paranormal and an unwanted task of defending the helpless are only a few of the correlations between the two characters.\" Jack has also been compared to the title character of America's \"\", which featured lesbian subtext between Xena (Lucy Lawless) and her close friend Gabrielle (Renee O'Connor). Polina Skibinskaya, writing for AfterElton.com, an American gay men's website, notes both are \"complex characters\" haunted by their past misdeeds. Furthermore, like Xena, Jack is \"a gay basher’s worst nightmare: a queer weapon-wielding, ass-kicking superhero gleefully chewing his way through awesome fight scenes\". One academic article refers to Jack as \"an indestructible Captain Scarlet figure\". In a comparative contrast, where the Doctor is a pacifist, Jack is more inclined to see violent means to reach similar ends. The BBC News website refers to Jack's role within \"Doctor Who\" as \"[continuing] what began with Ian Chesterton and continued later with Harry Sullivan\". Whereas in the classic series the female \"companions\" were sometimes exploited and sexualised for the entertainment of predominantly male audiences, the producers could reverse this dynamic with Jack, citing an equal need amongst modern audiences to \"look at good looking men\". John Barrowman linked the larger number of women watching the show as a key factor in this.\n\nJack is bisexual, and is the first televised \"Doctor Who\" character to be openly anything other than heterosexual. In Jack's first appearance, the Doctor suggests that Jack's orientation is more common in the 51st century, when humankind will deal with multiple alien species and becomes more sexually flexible. Within \"Doctor Who\"'s narrative, Jack's sexual orientation is not specifically labelled as that could \"make it an issue\". On creating Jack, Davies comments \"I thought: 'It's time you introduce bisexuals properly into mainstream television,'\" with a focus on making Jack fun and swashbuckling as opposed to negative and angsty. Davies also expresses that he didn't make the character bisexual \"from any principle\", but rather because \"it would be interesting from a narrative point of view.\" The bisexuality-related labels \"pansexual\" and \"omnisexual\" are also frequently applied to the character. Writer Steven Moffat suggests that questions of sexual orientation do not even enter into Jack's mind; Moffat also comments \"It felt right that the James Bond of the future would bed anyone.\" Within \"Torchwood\", the character refers to sexual orientation classifications as \"quaint\". In an interview with the \"Chicago Tribune\", John Barrowman explained that \"[He]’s bisexual, but in the realm of the show, we call him omnisexual, because on the show, [the characters] also have sex with aliens who take human form, and sex with male-male, women-women, all sorts of combinations.\" The term is also used once, in-universe, in the novel \"The House that Jack Built\", when Ianto comments to a woman's remark about Jack, \"He prefers the term 'omnisexual'.\"\n\nWhile in his first several \"Doctor Who\" appearances, Jack did not have a set costume, \"Torchwood\" established a continual look for Jack which recalled that of his first \"Doctor Who\" appearance. The design has been described as \"an iconic piece of sci-fi culture\". A writer for \"Wired\" attributes much of Jack's appeal to the coat: \"I think it has lots to do with that coat he always wears. Coats are cool, just like fezzes and bow ties and Stetsons. The only difference is that Captain Jack doesn't ever tell you his coat is cool. It just \"is\".\" In fact, in her essay \"Fashioning Masculinity and Desire\", Sarah Gilligan attributes \"Torchwood\"s popularity—as well as that of the character—to the costume. She credits the greatcoat with helping to fashion the character's masculinity, and argues that Jack's costume creates its own discourse \"through which costume drama and Post Heritage cinema's escapism flows\".\n\nDuring Jack's initial appearances in \"Doctor Who\", Russell T Davies held a \"half-hearted\" theory that Jack would dress specific to the time period he was in, to contrast the Doctor who dresses the same wherever and whenever he goes. He is introduced wearing a greatcoat in World War II-set episodes, but changes to modern day jeans in contemporary episode \"Boom Town\" and black leather in futuristic episodes. Davies admits that this was a \"bit of a lame idea\" and decided that Jack \"never looked better than when he was in his World War II outfit\". From the pilot of \"Torchwood\" onwards, Harkness once again wears period military clothes from the second World War, including braces and an officer's wool greatcoat in every appearance. Costume designer Ray Holman commented in a \"Torchwood Magazine\" interview that \"We always wanted to keep the World War Two hero look for him, so all his outfits have a 1940s flavour.\" Because the character was expected to \"be running around a lot\", Holman redesigned his RAF Group Captain's greatcoat from \"Doctor Who\" to make it more fluid and less \"weighty\". Jack's other costumes are \"loosely wartime based\", such as the trousers are \"getting more and more styled to suit his figure\". Holman explains that there are actually five Captain Jack coats used on the show. The \"hero version\" is used for most scenes, while there is also a wetcoat made with pre-shrunk fabric, running coat which is slightly shorter to prevent heels getting caught, and two \"stunt coats\" that had been \"hero coats\" in the first series.\" Davies feels the military uniform reinforces the idea that the character \"likes his Captain Jack Harkness identity\". Julie Gardner describes the coat as \"epic and classic and dramatic\", while director Brian Kelly believes it gives Jack \"a sweep and a presence\".\n\nFor \"Miracle Day\", Davies commissioned new costume designer Shawna Trpcic (previously costume designer for \"Angel\", \"Firefly\" and \"Dollhouse\") to create a new greatcoat design. This was partially motivated by Los Angeles' warmer climate; shooting in Wales had necessitated Barrowman be fit in much warmer clothing. The new coat is custom made by Italian designers, and is actually cashmere-blend wool where the previous one had been cotton. Trpcic says that she \"just wanted to modernise it, give it a more modern fit, but leave the drape and keep it cape-like\". Trpcic felt prepared for the job of redesigning the coat because of her prior work on \"Firefly\", tailoring for Nathan Fillion's Captain Malcolm Reynolds: \"I'm kind of used to iconic captain's coats and the importance of staying loyal to what the fans expect and to what we need\". Journalist Maureen Ryan commented that the new coat is \"greatly improved\" and the redesign \"gives the coat the kind of movement and swagger Jack brings with him on every adventure\".\n\nThe character is described as both \"lethally charming ... good looking and utterly captivating\", as well as \"flirtatious, cunning, clever and a bit of an action man\". Within \"Doctor Who\", Jack's personality is relatively light-hearted, although this changes in \"Torchwood\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s first series, where he becomes a darker character. In \"Torchwood\"'s first series, Jack has been shaped by his ongoing search for the Doctor and also by his role as a leader, in which he is predominantly more aloof. In \"Torchwood\", he would occasionally inquire or muse about the afterlife and religion, sympathising with a man's desire to die. Returning in \"Doctor Who\" Series Three, Jack indicates he now maintains a less suicidal outlook than before. In the second series of \"Torchwood\", Jack became a much more light-hearted character once again, after appearances in \"Doctor Who\" where he was reunited with the Doctor. In the third series of \"Torchwood\", the audience sees some of Jack's \"darker side\", as well as \"the secrets that Jack has, the pressures, drama and the trauma he's carrying on his shoulders\".\n\nLynnette Porter comments on Jack's relation to scholar Lord Raglan's theses on 'the hero' in fiction. Because Jack is immortal and always comes back from the dead, Porter argues that Jack cannot literally fulfil the \"physical death aspect\" of Raglan's criteria for a hero. However, Jack instead has several symbolic deaths. For instance, in the last scene of \"Children of Earth\". Porter observes that camera angles emphasise Jack's profile as solitary man atop a hill in Cardiff, departing. This scene of \"going away for good\" against the backdrop of the city he has long protected, hints at the death of the Captain Jack persona; in Porter's words, \"the immortal captain \"dies\" at the top of a hill in Wales at the conclusion of the \"epic\" miniseries\", \"epic\" traditionally being the genre of heroism. The American political blog Daily Kos states Jack \"can certainly be characterised as a Byronic hero, a tragic figure with a streak of melancholy, heroic yet misunderstood, bold yet rash. Most importantly, his sexuality is one single aspect of a much more complex, flawed character.\" G. Todd Davis examines the ways in which Jack conforms to the Byronic hero character trope. Physically, he identifies Jack as dark-haired and strikingly handsome, with masculine physique; he is intelligent and aware of it, to the point of a superiority complex; he demands unquestioning loyalty, has guilty secrets in his past, and is self-sacrificing. For this, Davis lists Jack alongside Milton's Satan from \"Paradise Lost\", Shelley's Prometheus, and also Angel from \"Buffy\", amongst others.\n\nAs a show, \"Torchwood\" is highly intertextual. The consequence of this is that many sides of Jack are shown across various media. One commentator feels that this emphasises Jack's pivotal place in the development and change of modern science fiction heroes. The character's unexpected popularity with a multitude of audiences, would later shape his appearances both as a traditional \"action hero\" and as a positive role model for younger viewers. Barrowman also remarks that \"The beauty of Captain Jack, and one of the reasons why I think, as an actor, I've landed on my feet, is that he's popular with one audience in \"Torchwood\" and with another in \"Doctor Who\".\"\n\nIn several instances in \"Torchwood\", Jack displays no qualms about killing a person of any species, which within \"Doctor Who\", allows Jack's character to act in ways the lead character cannot. Barrowman remarks, \"He'll do things the Doctor won't do ... [such as] fight. Jack will kill. And the Doctor, in a way, knows that, so he lets Jack do it. I'd say Jack's the companion-hero.\" A flashback in the third series of Torchwood shows Captain Jack sacrificing twelve children to aliens in order to save millions of lives. Davies feels that the third series of \"Torchwood\" is a \"tale of retribution and perhaps redemption\" for Captain Jack, who experiences \"maximum damage\" when his lover Ianto is killed. Davies chose to have Ianto die so that Jack would be damaged enough to sacrifice his grandson in order to destroy the same aliens.\n\nWhen reuniting with the Doctor in the 2007 series of \"Doctor Who\", he is told \"don't you dare\" when pointing a gun, and scolded when contemplating snapping the Master's neck. Witnessing the murder of his colleague Owen in \"Torchwood\", Jack shoots his killer in the forehead, killing him in an act of swift revenge. Whilst the Doctor scolds Jack for joining the Torchwood Institute (an organisation he perceives as xenophobic and aggressive), Jack maintains that he reformed the Institute in the Doctor's image; Jack himself had initially been critical of the moral failings of a 19th-century Torchwood. Actor Gareth David-Lloyd describes the 19th century Torchwood as \"quite ruthless and quite evil\" and \"on the other side\" from Jack and the Doctor. Through Jack, whose perspective is widened by his experiences in other planets and times, the organisation was able to grow less jingoistic. One academic article, which compares \"Torchwood\" to the American drama series \"24\", opines that Jack's attitudes make the show's ethos largely antithetical to that of \"24\". Because Jack explores the \"complexity of negotiating differing worldviews, cultural values, beliefs, and moral codes\" through a framework established by the Doctor, to \"value life, support democratic principles and egalitarianism, and protect those who cannot protect themselves\", consequently \"The world of \"Torchwood\" is depicted, not as the dichotomous \"us\" (or United States) and \"other\" of Jack Bauer's \"24\", but as the omnipolitical, omnisexual, omnicultural world of Jack Harkness.\" Porter finds, however, that like Bauer, Jack saves the world using similarly morally grey means when he tortures Beth the sleeper agent, in \"Sleeper\", in order to avert an interplanetary attack.\n\nAlthough science fiction heroes have, Porter argues, \"grown greyer over time\", Jack represents as of \"Children of Earth\" a culmination of this trend, resulting in a full \"devolution/deconstruction of the traditional hero\". In \"Children of Earth\", Jack has to sacrifice his own grandson to save the world. Barrowman was concerned that the storyline could have made the character unpopular. He believes however that Jack was given the tough decision on how to save humanity; the actor says \"when I read all of the stuff he had to do, I had to look at it from the point of view of 'I'm Jack Harkness and I'm right'.\" For Lynnette Porter, Jack's actions in the serial make him \"a benchmark for [morally] grey heroes\"; some audiences may even view him, in light of his actions, as \"villainous or downright monstrous.\" Although Jack ultimately saves the majority of the world's children and finds a way to foil the monstrous 456, the situation in which he is placed forces him to make a morally difficult (and to some viewers, reprehensible) decision. Such, Porter argues, is the mark of a grey hero. Davies stated in an interview with \"SFX\" that he \"loved\" the uproarious reaction to Jack's actions, defending the character in saying \"He saved every single child in the world! If you would fail to do that then you’re the monster, frankly. It’s this extraordinary treatment that only science fiction heroes get.\" When Jack is departing Earth, the music playing is titled \"Redemption\", signifying that his departure is also perhaps his redeeming act in the serial.\n\nRussell T Davies referred to a scene in \"Last of the Time Lords\" as promoting a theory that Jack may one day become recurring character \"the Face of Boe\" (a large, mysterious disembodied head in a glass case) as a consequence of his immortality and slow aging. The Face first appeared in the 2005 episode \"The End of the World\", appearing three times and maintaining a presence through to the end of the 2007 series. Barrowman described himself and David Tennant as being \"so excited\" to the extent where they \"jumped up screaming\" when they read Jack's line regarding the Face of Boe, remarking \"It was probably the most excitable moment we had during the shooting of that series.\" The Face of Boe had originally been a throwaway line in a script for \"The End of the World\"; because creating the character seemed expensive, the Face of Boe was nearly discarded and replaced. However, special effects designer Neil Gorton loved the idea and pushed to make sure the character lived. Davies loved Gorton's design and to his surprise, the character was written into future episodes and became pivotal in the third series. In a spin-off novel, \"The Stealer of Dreams\" (2005), Captain Jack makes a reference to the Face of Boe as a famous figure. Davies conceived the idea that the two characters might be connected midway through the production of the 2007 series.\n\nBarrowman states that when fans ask him if Jack is really the Face of Boe, he tells them he believes he is and states that he and Davies hold it to be true \"in [their] little world\"; the link is \"unconfirmed\" within the text of the show. As to \"how\" Jack becomes the Face, Barrowman feels the answer doesn't matter as it is intentionally mysterious. Barrowman likes the characters being connected because it means in spite of how the Doctor initially treats Jack, \"Boe becomes his confidante and the one the Doctor returns to for advice and information\" which he feels is a \"wonderful twist of events\". However, Davies chooses not to confirm (within the story's narrative) whether or not Jack really is the Face of Boe, stating \"the moment it became very true or very false, the joke dies\". He has refused the publication of spin-off novels and comic books that have tried to definitively link the two.\n\nIn relationship to \"Miracle Day\", where Jack becomes mortal, critics approached Barrowman and Davies about the implications of such a move for Jack's potential future as the Face of Boe. Barrowman stated that the open-ended rules of the science fiction genre meant that Jack could still become the Face of Boe even after \"Miracle Day\". By contrast, Davies was keen to emphasise that the possibility of Jack becoming the Face of Boe remained \"conjecture\", and that the possibility remained that Jack would not survive \"Miracle Day\", adding \"You know how I love killing people off.\"\n\nIn a \"Doctor Who Magazine\" interview, Barrowman described Jack's love for Ianto as \"lustful\", and explained \"I don't think he'd settle down with Ianto. He might do, but he'd let Ianto know that he [Jack] has to play around on the side\". The \"Torchwood\" Series Two premiere sees Jack ask Ianto out on a date, after finding out Gwen is engaged. John Barrowman and Gareth David-Lloyd opined in an interview at Comic-Con to fan questions that Jack's relationship with Ianto has however brought out Jack's empathy, and helped to ground him. John Barrowman said in an interview that Ianto \"brings out the \"human\" in [Jack]\" and \"brings out more ... empathy because he’s actually fallen for someone and he really cares about somebody ... [which] makes him warm to other people ... [and] makes him more approachable.\" In the same interview, Gareth David-Lloyd said of the relationship and his character that \"I think Ianto’s always made him care and that is really the heart of the show.\" However, Stephen James Walker feels that Jack's relationship with Ianto is one-sided; Ianto seems to feel the relationship is \"serious and committed\", but while dancing with Gwen in \"Something Borrowed\", Walker believes that Jack appears to equate his relationship with Ianto to nothing more than a \"recreational activity\", and considers it \"obvious Jack only has eyes and thoughts for Gwen\". The novel \"The House that Jack Built\" includes a scene where Ianto confides in Gwen that he knows that to Jack he is \"just a shag\", though discloses that the relationship means more to him. In the same novel, however, he also refers to himself in front of Jack as his \"boyfriend\". When Ianto expounds these same insecurities to Jack in the radio play \"The Dead Line\" (just prior to \"Children of Earth\"), however, Jack insists \"You will never be just a blip in time, Ianto Jones. Not to me.\"\n\nJust as Jack and Ianto's relationship is developing, Ianto dies, in \"Children of Earth\" (2009). While some fans felt \"cheated\" at not seeing the relationship develop further, Davies explains his intention was to heighten the tragedy by it also being a loss of potential, stating \"You grieve over everything they could have been. Everything you hoped for them.\" For dramatic purposes within the story, Davies explains that Ianto's death was necessary so that Jack would be damaged enough to sacrifice his own grandson. Gareth David-Lloyd feels that the lack of resolution for the love story is \"part of the tragedy\". Lynnette Porter feels that Ianto's demise is intended as a watershed moment where Jack loses his effectiveness as a hero. At least for a time, a grieving Jack loses his focus and gives up; within a few months, Jack flees Earth and his role as the expected hero. Some fans were displeased by Ianto's death scene and the end of the relationship, and some even accused one the writers of \"deliberately egging on the shippers'\". Subsequent to Ianto's death, in \"The End of Time\" (2010), the Doctor sets up Jack with a new romantic interest, Alonso Frame (Tovey). Fans of Ianto, who felt cheated by the character's death, disliked this development. GayNZ.com compared the situation to \"Buffy\" fans' reaction to Willow's relationship with Kennedy (Iyari Limon) in \"Buffy\"s seventh season, following Tara's death in the show's sixth.\n\nIanto makes a post-death appearance in 2011 audio drama \"The House of the Dead\". Encountering Ianto's spirit at a haunted location in Wales, Jack and Ianto are permitted a final goodbye. Without Ianto in his life, Jack wishes to be swept up into the Cardiff spacetime rift as it closes in an attempt at suicide. Ianto tricks Jack into leaving the House of the Dead, however, despite the possibility of resurrection. As they are forced to part forever by the closing of the rift, the couple declare their love for one another for the first and last time.\n\nBarrowman states in a behind-the-scenes featurette that Gwen brings a \"little bit of soul\" back to Jack, following her recruitment. In a 2007 interview, Eve Myles, who plays Gwen, describes the relationship between Jack and Gwen as a \"palpable love\" and opines that \"with Jack and Gwen, it’s the real thing and they’re going to make you wait for that.\" The first two series suggest the possibility of romantic and sexual tension behind Jack and Gwen's working relationship, with Stephen James Walker drawing on the firing range sequence in series one episode \"Ghost Machine\" as a key example, as well as the scene where Jack discovers that Gwen has become engaged to Rhys in \"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang\", the series two opener. AfterElton.com's Locksley Hall conjectures that Jack is attracted to Gwen because of \"her warmth, her sense of justice, her very ordinariness and lack of glamour\", whilst Eve Myles explains Gwen's attraction to Jack by stating: \"the most monogamous woman in the world would probably go for him – it'd be hard not to\". Valerie Estelle Frankel describes Jack as a \"compelling trickster\", who acts out Gwen's private desires with his \"outrageous flirting\". She suggests that Jack (unlike Rhys) is not mature enough to occupy the role of \"steady prince\" for Gwen, whilst Barrowman feels that if Jack were to settle down with her, \"he'd have to commit completely\"; this is why he does not act on his feelings, because though Gwen would let him flirt with other people, he could \"never afford to do anything more\". Gareth David-Lloyd, who played Ianto, feels that for Jack, \"there’s two different sorts of love going on there\", and that Jack feels for Gwen and Ianto in different ways, although both have helped him become less emotionally isolated. Lynnette Porter feels that part of the reason Jack leaves Earth at the conclusion of \"Children of Earth\" is Gwen's idealisation of Jack, which is so intense that he cannot stand to look at her in the wake of Ianto's death. Gwen hopes that she is reason enough for Jack to stay on Earth, but Jack is ready to give up any hero worship because he feels unworthy.\n\nA press release for \"Torchwood\" Series Four states that Jack is brought back to Earth because of his \"unstated love\" for Gwen, who in turn still feels for Jack and misses the exciting life she once led beside him. Whilst \"Miracle Day\" lead writer Russell T Davies states in response to a question posed by AfterElton that he \"hates\" the idea of romantic tension between Gwen and Jack, executive producer Julie Gardner answers by stating \"They love each other. Of course they do.\" Myles believes that in series four, Gwen and Jack have a \"love-hate-love relationship\" resembling in different ways a sibling relationship, a marital relationship and also \"the strongest friendship\". Episode seven of \"Miracle Day\" features a scene where Jack threatens Gwen with violence after she states she would have him killed to save her daughter. Writer Jane Espenson explains that the two characters have different needs and that this means they inevitably \"clash like steel blades\". Simon Brew of Den of Geek praises the dynamic between Gwen and Jack in series four, describing them as \"a terrific double act\" and states that \"\"Torchwood\" is at, or near, its best when the two of them are working in tandem\".\n\nDiscussing whether his character could ever find \"The One\", John Barrowman asserts that Jack \"likes everybody, and his love for each person is different\". Barrowman believes that Jack does harbour romantic feelings toward the Doctor, but \"would never take that beyond infatuation\" and \"would never let the Doctor know\". Barrowman claims that Jack also \"fancies\" fellow companion Martha Jones, admiring her \"tenacity\" and willingness to \"spat with him\", and describes Jack's love for Toshiko and Owen as \"fatherly\", stating \"He was guiding them. That's why it was so devastating for him to lose them.\" The second series of \"Torchwood\" also introduced Jack's ex-lover, Captain John. Head writer Chris Chibnall introduced John to act as a \"proper nemesis, somebody to really test [Jack], to push him, and to reveal something about Jack's character\". In the use of Captain John as a literary foil, Chibnall comments \"you see the way Jack could have gone, and probably did, for a little while\" which underlines how \"Jack, in his experiences with the Doctor and Torchwood, made a very conscious decision to move away from that behaviour.\"\n\nIn their academic publication, \"Queer TV\", Glyn Davis and Gary Needham discuss Jack's role within \"Torchwood\" as a post-gay, romantic hero. Noting \"Torchwood\"'s central gay themes, they comment that \"it is through the character of Captain Jack that \"Torchwood\" is able to mine its queerness.\" Discussing Jack's brief romance with his namesake, the real Captain Jack (Matt Rippy), academic critics have noted that \"The Captain Jacks both share the same name and are quite similar in physical appearance, thus literalising the homo-ness of the situation. Through the time-travel device this points to a narcissistic self-fascination, the old cliché that homosexuality is the love for sameness.\" Other relationships which have been described or alluded to (both in the television series and other media) include ex-girlfriends Estelle Cole, Duchess Eleanor, Stella Courtney, and Lucia Moretti, ex-boyfriends and Angelo Colasanto, as well as an unnamed ex-wife.\n\nDescribing the patterns of his relationships throughout the series, Davis and Needham draw the conclusion that \"while Captain Jack desires both men and women, his long-term love affairs and onscreen kisses are mostly with men in the past and present.\" Davies himself laments that this one of the pitfalls of writing a bisexual character, commenting \"The trap you fall into with bisexual men is only having them sleep with men.\" Commenting on the show's postmodern attitude towards bisexuality, or in what Russell T Davies calls \"omnisexuality\", they continue to remark that \"His character brushes against definitions of queer sexuality in that he resists any sort of classification based on sexual orientation.\" They also comment on the subtexts of particular episodes, such as gay time-travel romance episode \"Captain Jack Harkness\", and within that the relevance of time-travelling Jack Harkness to tackle the question of forbidden gay attraction in what is post-\"Brokeback\" television. In \"Understanding TV Texts\" by Phil Wickham, Wickham opines that Captain Jack explicitly \"brings to the fore\" with his \"brazen bisexuality\", \"something we have to come to expect [from Russell T Davies] as viewers of his work\". Fans expressed fear that an Americanized fourth series of the show would mean the show would no longer portray Jack's bisexuality, but Davies assured interviewers that Jack's interests in both men and women would be honoured.\n\nFollowing the character's initial introduction in the revived series 1 of \"Doctor Who\", the character became incredibly popular with fans, to the extent that Russell T Davies and Julie Gardner created a spin-off series, \"Torchwood\", primarily centred around the character. \"The Times\" described the undeniable success of the character as having propelled actor John Barrowman to \"National Treasure status\". For his role as Captain Jack, John Barrowman was nominated for Best Actor at the 2007 BAFTA Cymru Awards, and again for \"Children of Earth\" at the 2010 TV Choice Awards, against Eleventh Doctor actor Matt Smith. Harkness was also listed number nine in \"TV Squad'<nowiki>s</nowiki>\" \"Ten Most mysterious characters on television\", behind the Tenth Doctor, who was listed number three. John Barrowman, who is himself gay, has ranked in the \"Independent on Sunday\" Pink List, a list of the most influential gay people in Britain, in 2007, 2008, and 2009 with the \"Independent\" commenting that \"Proof of his popularity came with the continued runaway success of his bisexual Captain Jack Harkness on Russell T Davies's \"Torchwood\"\". Part of Jack's mystique was his sex appeal, swashbuckling heroism and sexual appetite. In anticipation of the character's return to \"Doctor Who\" in series 3 after a successful run in the first series of \"Torchwood\", mainstream media hailed his return.\n\nCaptain Jack has gone on to become a recognisable figure in the British public consciousness, and has attracted some parody. These parodies frequently echo criticisms both of the character and of Barrowman's portrayal. The character of Jack Harkness has been parodied several times on the satirical impressionist television show \"Dead Ringers\". Played by Jon Culshaw, the show pokes fun at his bisexuality and apparent campness, as well his melodramatic personality in \"Torchwood\". In one sketch, he walks bizarrely towards the camera, kissing a policeman as he passes him. In another sketch, he can be seen having a threesome with two Cybermen, a race of cyborgs from \"Doctor Who\". Satirical technology columnist Verity Stob wrote a parody of \"Torchwood\" Season One in the style of Dylan Thomas's radio play \"Under Milk Wood\", called \"Under Torch Wood\". This parody described Captain Jack as \"the insomniac bicon; snug as a hobbit, pretty as a choirboy, immortal as carbon dioxide, wooden as a horse.\" Barrowman's ubiquity, however, has even provoked criticism of the character. Jim Shelley of the \"Daily Mirror\", in his review of \"Children of Earth\", said \"Unlike David Tennant's Doctor, Barrowman's endless appearances on friendly drivel like \"Tonight's the Night\", \"The Kids Are All Right\" and \"Any Dream Will Do\", is so over-exposed, 'Captain Jack' is about as intriguing or alien as a Weetabix and twice as irritating. Unlike Tennant, as an actor he is just not good enough.\" Television journalist Charlie Brooker, in his \"Screenwipe\" review of 2009 criticised Barrowman, with focus on his acting. \"Harkness is of course a man of mystery. You can't tell what he's thinking just by looking at his face... no matter how hard Barrowman tries.\"\n\nThe character's recognisability extends outside the UK. In a Halloween episode of the 2008 series of American drama \"Knight Rider\", character Billy Morgan (Paul Campbell) dresses up as Captain Jack, whom he refers to as \"the time-travelling bisexual\". Jack represents a new character archetype, which other writers have begun to draw from. For example, comic book writer Peter David reflects that in writing Marvel Comics character Shatterstar, he \"to some degree... key[s] his personality off Captain Jack Harkness\" insofar as he is \"swashbuckling, enthusiastic and sexually curious about anything with a pulse\". In 2009, Barrowman's variety show \"Tonight's the Night\" broadcast a specially written humorous scripted by Russell T Davies. In the scene, Barrowman appears initially as Captain Jack confronting an alien on board the TARDIS who claims to be the Doctor. However, David Tennant appears as himself and John Barrowman is revealed as playing Captain Jack in the TARDIS set. Action figures have also been created in the actor's likeness, which Barrowman says was a \"longtime dream\".\nIn the media, Jack is described as both the \"first openly gay companion\" and as a \"hunky bisexual\". Jack's notability is largely due to his mainstream representation of a bisexual man in science fiction television, for whom sexual identity is \"matter-of-fact\", and not an issue. The ordinariness with which Jack's orientation is regarded within \"Doctor Who\" embodies part of a political statement about changing societal views of homosexuality. The distinct flexibility of Jack's sexuality contributed directly towards the character's popularity and public interest. The overtness of Jack's sexuality broke new grounds, the labels \"pansexual\" and \"omnisexual\" being applied to the character on occasion. In \"The Parting of the Ways\", Jack kissed both Rose and the Doctor on the lips, the latter being the first same-sex kiss in the history of the program. Despite the boldness of the first lesbian, gay or bisexual character in the series' run, there has been very little uproar about the character, although there was some controversy at the time of Jack's introduction. Speculating, Barrowman tries to link Jack's popularity with this portrayal, noting \"I think audiences just get Jack because he's honest ... to finally see a character who doesn't care who he flirts with, I think is a bit refreshing.\"\n\nThe presence of the character in prime time television sparked discussion of the nature of bisexuality in a number of outlets where normally it is dismissed or overlooked. Channel4.com cites Jack as a positive role model for gay and bisexual teenagers, where little had been present for this audience in years gone by and subsequently leading to a greater culture of tolerance. Dr Meg-John Barker writes for the \"Journal of Bisexuality\" that although \"the \"b\" word does not actually get used during the show\", Jack is one of the first positive and clearly bisexual characters on British television. She does point out however that Jack retains some elements of bisexual stereotyping, particularly in his \"flamboyant\" promiscuity. Jack has also been cited in America to contrast the portrayals of non-heterosexual characters in mainstream television in the US and the UK. Gary Scott Thompson, producer of the 2008 revival of \"Knight Rider\", said, \"If I could use Jack in \"Torchwood\" as a role model—I would absolutely use him as a role model—I love his conflictedness about ... everybody\".\n\nReaders of AfterElton.com voted Jack the tenth best gay or bisexual television character of all time, the poll itself ultimately being won by Brian Kinney, a character from the North American version of \"Queer as Folk\" which was developed by Ron Cowen and Daniel Lipman from the British series created by Russell T Davies. The website praised Jack—one of only two bisexual characters on the list of 25—for being having both \"tough\" and \"tender\" sides to his personality, as seen in the \"Torchwood\" episode \"Captain Jack Harkness\". Amongst science fiction characters, Jack also topped another AfterElton rundown of top characters, beating \"Hellblazer\"'s John Constantine for the top spot, commenting upon Jack's representation of a \"'post-gay' approach to sexual themes\" and awarding him a full 10/10 for cultural significance. For the AfterElton 2008 Visibility Awards, Jack won the award for Favourite TV Character. The website commented that \"unlike virtually every other TV sci-fi character, lead or supporting, Captain Jack is also openly bisexual. Ironically, this \"small\" change served to help make the science fiction genre, long the ultimate bastion of straight men, accessible not just to LGBT people, but also straight women, who also enjoy the show’s alternate take on sexuality.\" The third award won for \"Torchwood\", after Favourite TV Drama and Character, was won by Jack and Ianto for Best Couple, for which the editor commented \"\"Torchwood\" is revolutionary not just because the producers dare to put openly bisexual (or in Jack's case \"omnisexual\") characters in the formerly sacrosanct setting of sci-fi; it's also that it presents these bisexual characters in such an amazingly matter-of-fact way. There's no apologi[s]ing, no minimi[s]ing, and no morali[s]ing—just good, old-fashioned romance and adventure.\"\n\n"}

At one time, the facility also hosted ETSU's football team, but the school discontinued its football program at the end of the 2003 season as a cost-cutting measure. The football team was reinstated in 2015, but did not return to the facility; the Buccaneers played the 2015 and 2016 seasons at Kermit Tipton Stadium, a local high school facility, before opening the new William B. Greene Jr. Stadium in 2017. It was the host of the 2006 and 2007 Atlantic Sun Conference men's basketball tournaments, and the NAIA Indoor Track and Field Championships from 2001 to 2011.

The decision was made by ETSU president Dr. Paul Stanton for ETSU to drop football following the conclusion of the 2003 season.\n\nFor the 2006–2007 academic year and basketball season, the Mini-Dome's occupancy was decreased to around 6,800 due to fire code restrictions. Efforts are underway to build a true basketball arena on campus, but the Mini-Dome will likely remain intact due to the large number of offices and training facilities it contains, as well as the enormous cost of demolition.\n\nIn 2006–2007, ETSU made an attempt to bring back the football program, but it failed when the student body voted down an increase in the athletic fee that was needed to fund it.

Hilton Coliseum, commonly Hilton Coliseum, is a 14,384-seat multi-purpose arena located in Ames, Iowa. The arena opened in 1971. It is home to the Iowa State University Cyclones men's and women's basketball teams, wrestling, gymnastics and volleyball teams.\n\nThe building was constructed in 1971 as part of the Iowa State Center, an athletic and cultural events area located southeast of the main campus. The Coliseum was named after Dr. James H. Hilton, ISU's president from 1953 to 1965, who pushed for the construction of the facility. The Iowa State Center also includes Jack Trice Stadium, C.Y. Stephens Auditorium, Fisher Theater and Scheman Continuing Education Building. Hilton Coliseum and Jack Trice Stadium replaced the Iowa State Armory and Clyde Williams Stadium, at the corner of Union Dr. & Sheldon Ave.\n\nThe first band to ever perform at the Hilton Coliseum was Meloncolony, a band composed of Midwest natives: Chuck Vail (singer), Wayne Groff (organ), Matt Peterson (bass), Clint Dudley (guitar), and Bob Curtis (drums). The band performed at an event organized by the YMCA to both entertain and encourage 2,300 locals to register to vote. Of the 2,300, 200 people registered that night. Phish played the arena in both 1996 and 1999.\n\nThe arena hosted the 1972 NCAA basketball tournament Midwest Regionals, as well as the 1982, 1988 and 1993 NCAA wrestling championships. The arena is also the site of the annual Iowa All State Music Festival. It has also hosted commencements, concerts, conventions and other assemblies. A record basketball crowd of 15,000 saw the Cyclones post a 97-94 win over Iowa in 1971. Until Wells Fargo Arena in Des Moines was built, Hilton Coliseum was Central Iowa's premier entertainment venue.\n\n\"Hilton Magic\", the power of the Coliseum faithful to produce unexpected victories, was first recognized by \"Des Moines Register\" sportswriter Buck Turnbull. On a Feb. 14, 1989, showdown with No. 3 Missouri, the Cyclones conjured up the spirit of the Hilton crowd to produce a stunning 82–75 victory. The following day’s headline read “Hilton Magic Spells ‘Upset’ One More Time.”\n\nIn the article, Turnbull called for more “Hilton Magic” in the Cyclones’ upcoming bout with Oklahoma State, which had pummeled ISU, 102–74, just three weeks earlier. On cue, “Hilton Magic” displayed its powers, as the Cyclones defeated the Cowboys, 90–81, marking a 37-point reversal from the season’s prior meeting.\n\nHilton Coliseum was specifically built to hold in sound with a solid concrete structure, steel doors, and a crowd that sits just a few feet from the court. With a fan base that frequently ranks among the nation's largest crowds, players from opposing teams, as well as Iowa State, have said that the floor has shaken due to the loudness of the crowd.\n\nAfter more than two decades, the term “Hilton Magic” still applies today. This reality was never more apparent than ISU’s school-record 39-game homecourt winning streak that ended during the 2001-02 season. The streak, which spanned four different basketball seasons, was the second-longest in the nation at the time. In 2003-04, Iowa State went 17–1 in Hilton, recording the second-best single-season home win total in school history. In 2011-12, Iowa State went 16–2 with second year head coach and Iowa State alum, \"The Mayor\" Fred Hoiberg.\n\nOn March 2, 2015, the Cyclones made one of its most miraculous comebacks in school history. Trailing by 21 points early in the second half, No. 17 Iowa State rallied to beat No. 15 Oklahoma, 77–70, in Hilton Coliseum. The 21-point come-from-behind victory tied the largest comeback in school history.\n\nIn the last 7 seasons (2012–2018) Iowa State is 94–16 in Hilton Coliseum, but went 9–7 in Hilton Coliseum in 2018.\n\nJames H. Hilton Coliseum is recognized as one of the finest facilities for collegiate basketball in the nation. CBS SportsLine.com’s Dan Wetzel rated Hilton No. 10 on his list of the nation’s top college basketball arenas. Until the completion of the Sukup Practice Facility in the fall of 2009, both Cyclone squads held practices and games in the 14,384-seat arena. Both women's and men's teams continue to play home games at Hilton.\n\nHilton offers newly refurbished dressing rooms for both the ISU women's and men's teams, and additional rooms for visiting teams and officials. Hilton also houses a weight room, training room, media room, and the newly refurbished offices of the women's volleyball team. Men and women's basketball offices were relocated to the Sukup Practice Facility on its completion.\n\nThe men’s team has compiled a 112–24 (.824 winning percentage) home record during the last eight years. Iowa State has posted 10 or more home victories in the last 14 seasons.\n\nHilton Magic has been ever-present recently, helping the Cyclones tally a school-record 39 consecutive wins in the facility. The Cyclones went undefeated at home during the 1999-2000 and 2000-01 seasons and increased their winning streak to 30 games at the beginning of the 2001-02 campaign.\n\nIowa State and Hilton broke NIT attendance marks in 2004. The Cyclones drew 12,196 and 14,020 fans in their two NIT games they hosted, averaging 13,144 fans per contest. The Cyclones were 30th nationally in attendance in 2005 and were 26th in 2006.\n\nThe Iowa State women ranked among the top 11 nationally in women’s basketball attendance average for the eighth consecutive year last season, playing in front of 7,667 fans per game. Cyclone fans are getting their money’s worth, as ISU recorded its third undefeated home slate (15–0) in Hilton Coliseum in 2004-05. In 2009, the Cyclones had the 3rd highest attendance average in the nation.\n\nThe Cyclones recorded the first women’s basketball sellout crowd when 14,092 attended the WNIT double-header in Hilton Coliseum on March 25, 2004. ISU defeated Saint Joseph's, 66–58, to advance to the WNIT Final Four. Iowa State and its enthusiastic crowds earned the Cyclones a homecourt advantage for all four WNIT postseason games.\n\nBoth the men’s and women’s teams closed out the 2000-01 season with nationally ranked home win streaks. Together, the two programs posted a 65–1 record in Hilton Coliseum in the 1999-2000 and 2000-01 seasons combined. In 2001-02 the combined men’s and women’s basketball attendance ranked 6th nationally (22,406). During the 2014-15 season, the Cyclone women scored major upsets at home against No. 3 Texas, 59–57, on Jan. 10, and No. 3 Baylor, 76–71, on Senior Day, Feb. 28, 2015.\n\nOn January 17, 2015, Hilton Coliseum hosted ESPN's College Gameday in front of roughly 7,000 fans. That evening, a sold-out Hilton saw the No. 11 Cyclones defeat No. 9 Kansas, 86–81.\n\nThrough the 2017-18 season, the Iowa State men's basketball team boasts a 544–179 record at Hilton Coliseum.\n\nSome of the most cherished moments in Hilton Coliseum history have come by way of the tradition-rich ISU wrestling program. Hilton was home to Cael Sanderson’s unprecedented, undefeated 4-year career of 159–0 and his quartet of national championships.\n\nFans in Hilton on January 9, 1981, also had the privilege of seeing Dave Osenbaugh’s pin of national heavyweight champion Lou Banach of Iowa.\n\nThe Iowa State wrestling program has hosted five NCAA Championship events in 1974, 1979, 1982, 1988 and 1993 and Hilton has been home to eight conference meets in 1976, 1979, 1983, 1986, 1994, 1999, 2004, and most recently in 2006.\n\nJames H. Hilton Coliseum is recognized as one of the finest facilities in the nation and provides a top-notch home for the Iowa State gymnastics team, playing host to the 2000 Big 12 Championship and the 2006 NCAA Regional Meet.\n\nThe Iowa State volleyball team also calls Hilton Coliseum home. The Cyclones hosted the NCAA First Round in 1995 at Hilton Coliseum, defeating No. 22 Idaho in straight sets on Nov. 29, in the Cyclones' first-ever NCAA Tournament appearance. Iowa State also hosted NCAA First and Second Round games in 2009, 2011, and 2012.\n\nThe arena received a new $2.5 million video and sound system in 2006. These improvements are just the beginning of the up $60 million in planned renovation and construction to the facility, over the next 10 years.\n\nFor the start of the 2016-2017 Men's Basketball season new blackout lighting was introduced that allows the stadium to be blacked out and then immediately resume normal lighting conditions. This allows them to provide special lighting sequences like when announcing players before a game starts.\n\nHilton Coliseum was constructed in the flood plain of Squaw Creek. The Coliseum has been inundated with flood water in both 1993 and 2010, but its mostly concrete design simplifies restoring it to service after floods.\n\n\n"}

It was created by German figure skater Werner Rittberger, and is often called the Rittberger in Europe. It also gets its name from the shape the blade would leave on the ice if the skater performed the rotation without leaving the ice. The skater executes it by taking off from the back outside edge of the skating foot, turning one rotation in the air, and landing on the back outside edge of the same foot. It is often performed as the second jump in a combination.\n\nThe loop jump is an edge jump in the sport of figure skating. It was created by German figure skater Werner Rittberger, and is often called the Rittberger in Europe. According to U.S. Figure Skating, the loop jump is \"the most fundamental of all the jumps\". According to writer Ellyn Kestnbaum, the jump also gets its name from the shape the blade would leave on the ice if the skater performed the rotation without leaving the ice. In competitions, the base value of the single loop jump is 0.50; the base value of a double loop is 1.70; the base value of a triple loop is 4.90; and the base value of a quadruple loop is 10.50.\n\nThe first triple loop was completed by American Dick Button during the 1952 Winter Olympics. The first woman to perform a triple loop was Gabriele Seyfert, from East Germany, in 1968. Russian skater Evgeni Plushenko was the first to complete a loop jump in combination, a double loop, with a quadruple toe loop and a triple toe loop, at the 1999 NHK Trophy. Plushenko was also the first to complete a triple loop jump in combination, with a quadruple toe loop and a triple toe loop, at the Cup of Russia in 2002. Yuzuru Hanyu from Japan was the first skater to complete the quadruple loop, at the Autumn Classic International in 2016.\n\nThe loop jump is an edge jump. The skater executes it by taking off from the back outside edge of the skating foot, turning one rotation in the air, and landing on the back outside edge of the same foot. \"Atlantic Monthly\", in its description of all jumps, states, \"An easy way to remember this jump is that it's basically a toe loop without the assist of the toe pick\". The jump is usually approached directly from back crossovers, which allows the skater to establish his or her upper body position while gliding backwards on his or her right outside edge before springing into the air. The loop is more difficult than the toe loop and salchow because the free leg is already crossed at takeoff, so the rotation is begun from the edge of the skating foot and the upper body. The coordination and weight shift does not need to be exact while performing the loop, so many skaters consider it an easier jump than the flip and lutz. It is often performed as the second jump in a combination because it takes off from the same edge as \"the standard jump landing\". Kestnbaum states, \"The fact that the free leg remains in front makes both controlling the landing of the first jump and generating the lift and rotation for the second more difficult than when a toe loop is used as the second jump\". A loop jump is considered incorrectly done if the takeoff is two-footed, meaning that the free foot does not leave the ice before the takeoff.\n\n"}

Until the 1998 completion of the Bi-Lo Center in Greenville, it was the largest arena in the Greenville-Spartanburg-Anderson market.\n\nLittlejohn Coliseum has been the scene of 43 Clemson wins over ranked teams, including a victory over #1 Duke in 1980, a 75–65 victory over #1 North Carolina in 2001, and a 74–47 victory over #3 Duke in 2009.\n\nBoth the men's and women's basketball teams have won roughly 75% of their games played in Littlejohn. In January 2010, it hosted ESPN's College Gameday for a game against Duke.\n\nLittlejohn Coliseum was renovated and reopened on January 5, 2003. The overall building square footage was increased from 95,000 to 167,500. The square footage for both the training room and weight room was increased eightfold, while the media facility was increased by 3.5 times. Over of curtain wall as well as a new 700-ton roof were added. Fan amenities were also renovated, as restrooms were tripled and concessions areas were doubled. The renovations included all new purple cushion seats with orange tiger paws and a new playing floor. The cost of the renovation – $31 million – was approximately ten times that of the original building cost.\n\nAs well as sports, in its 50 year history, Littlejohn Coliseum has hosted many concerts by musical groups, including Allman Brothers Band in '71, Chicago, R.E.M. in '87, Def Leppard, Huey Lewis and the News, Fleetwood Mac, David Lee Roth, Rod Stewart, Ozzy Osbourne, Alice in Chains in '92, 311 in '03, Fall Out Boy with Plain White T's and Young Wild Things Tour in '07, Evanescence on tour in 2012, and former Clemson football player Lee Brice in 15. It annually hosted FM 93.3 The Planet's \"Birthday Bash.\" \n\nIn 2011, Clemson announced a $50 million athletic building plan. As a part of this plan, Littlejohn Coliseum was renovated. An additional practice facility was built at the southwest corner of Littlejohn Coliseum. Cost for the project was estimated at $5 million. The renovation was completed with an opening ceremony on October 14, 2016. The construction project cost a total of $63.5 million. The renovated studio included the new Swann Pavilion, which includes a practice gym, team suites, a film room, weight room and lounges. The renovation also upgraded the stadium entrance, exterior, and added two new LED boards. To fit in the new facilities, the basketball floor was rotated 90 degrees, and the stadium capacity was reduced to 9,000 seats.\n\n\n"}

It is home to the BYU Cougars men's and women's basketball teams. The seating capacity for basketball games at the Marriott Center is officially 18,987.\n\nThe largest basketball arena in the West Coast Conference (in which BYU competes for most sports, except football), it is among the largest on-campus basketball arenas in the nation. In addition to basketball, the Marriott Center is used for weekly devotionals and forums.\n\nThe elevation of the court is approximately above sea level.\n\nThe Marriott Center was named in honor of benefactor and hotel tycoon J. Willard Marriott, founder of the Marriott Corporation. When the arena opened in 1971, it passed the University of Minnesota's Williams Arena as the largest college basketball arena in the nation. It was also the largest venue in the nation built for basketball, larger than any NBA (or ABA) arena at that time. It lost both distinctions when the University of Kentucky opened Rupp Arena in 1976, but remained as the largest basketball-specific facility on a U.S. college campus until 1987, when the University of Tennessee opened Thompson–Boling Arena.\nPrior to 1971, the Cougars played basketball games at Smith Fieldhouse, which remains the primary venue for volleyball and gymnastics. The court was replaced in 2003 with a permanent floor.\n\nThe Marriott Center hosted the West Regionals of the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament four times (1972, 1977, 1979, 1982), and the Western Athletic Conference men's basketball tournament in 1988.\n\nOn February 7, 1993, Cody Judy threatened LDS apostle Howard W.

The lower bench seating on the north side was replaced with prime chair seating. A new sound system was installed, and the men's and women's locker rooms were renovated. The changes in the lower seating lowered the Marriott Center’s capacity from 22,700 to 20,951.\n\nThe remaining lower bench seating was replaced after the 2015 season, lowering seating capacity to around 19,000. The new renovation also installed new video boards for the Marriott Center and the Marriott Center Annex building, where practice sessions take place for both teams. The Marriott Center Annex (nicknamed the \"Y\" MCA) was placed between the Marriott Center and the BYU Broadcasting Building.\n\n\n"}

Joyce Athletic & Convocation Center, often called the Joyce Center, formerly the Athletic & Convocation Center, is a 9,149-seat multi-purpose arena in Notre Dame, Indiana just north of South Bend. The arena opened in 1968. It is home to the University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish basketball and volleyball teams. The main arena, Phillip J. Purcell Pavilion, is located in the southern portion of the facility. The northern portion housed a hockey rink until October 2011. It also houses the Castellan Family Fencing Center and Rolfs Aquatic Center (which was added on in 1985) in the rear of the building.\n\nIt is located across a pedestrian arcade from Notre Dame Stadium, and the center's two domes could easily be seen rising above the stadium's east side prior to its expansion.\n\nThe building, designed by architects at Ellerbe Architects of Saint Paul, Minnesota, was built in 29 months, and opened the first week of December 1968 as the Athletic & Convocation Center. It was renamed in 1987 to honor the Rev. Edmund P. Joyce, C.S.C., Notre Dame's executive vice president from 1952 to 1987. Prior to the building of the Joyce Center, the basketball team played in the Notre Dame Fieldhouse, which opened in 1900. The Fighting Irish Hockey team played in the North dome from 1968 to 2011. They moved to the Compton Family Ice Arena in October 2011.\nThe last hockey game at the Joyce Center was played on October 15, 2011 (Ohio State beat Notre Dame 4-3). ND's Austin Wuthrich scored the last goal at the Joyce Center.\n\nIn the fall of 2006, the university announced major renovation plans for the Joyce Center. In 2009, the south dome, which houses the basketball arena, underwent a $24.6 million renovation and was renamed Purcell Pavilion, after Philip J. Purcell, a Notre Dame alumnus, trustee, and current chair of the athletic affairs committee. Architectural firm HNTB studied the center after the university began considering renovations in 2001 and worked on the project. Phase 1 of the project was completed in October 2009, with its first event, the women's volleyball \"Dig Pink\" match for Breast Cancer between Notre Dame and Seton Hall, taking place on Halloween. The first basketball game took place the following night as the Fighting Irish men's squad faced Lewis University in an exhibition contest. Due to the renovation, the capacity of Purcell Pavilion at the Joyce Center dropped from 11,418 to 9,149. A new video scoreboard over center court was installed prior to the 2010–2011 basketball season.\n\nNotre Dame has a rich tradition of ending winning streaks at the Joyce Center, with victories over eventual national champions, defending NCAA titlists, and number-one-ranked teams.

{"id": "1919810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1919810", "title": "Lucifer of Cagliari", "text": "Lucifer of Cagliari\n\nLucifer of Cagliari (, ; died 20 May 370 or 371) was a bishop of Cagliari in Sardinia known for his passionate opposition to Arianism. He is venerated as a Saint in Sardinia, though his status remains controversial.\n\nLucifer first appears in history as an envoy from Pope Liberius to the Emperor Constantius II,\nrequesting the convening of a church council. At the Council of Milan in 355, he defended Athanasius of Alexandria against Arian attempts to secure his condemnation by Western bishops. It was reported that Constantius II, a supporter of Arian theology, confined Lucifer for three days in the Imperial Palace, where Lucifer continued to argue vehemently on behalf of Athanasius. Along with Eusebius of Vercelli and Dionysius of Milan, Lucifer was exiled for his opposition to the imperial ecclesiastical policy. He was banished first to Germanicia, the see of bishop Eudoxius, thereafter to Palestine and finally to the Thebais in Egypt. While in exile, he wrote fiery pamphlets to the Emperor in which he proclaimed himself to be ready to suffer martyrdom for his beliefs.\n\nDisciple of St Eusebius of Rome, he became a scholar in Greek and Hebrew languages, and then was baptized by the Pope Eusebius. St Lucifer wrote a well documented \"Vita S. Eusebii Vercellensis\" (from Latin, \"Life of Saint Eusebius of Vercelli\").\n\nAfter the death of Constantius and the accession of Julian the Apostate, Lucifer and other expatriated bishops were allowed to return from exile in 361 or 362. However, he would not be reconciled to former Arians. He opposed the Bishop Meletius, who came to accept the Nicene creed (and for that was driven out by Arians). Although Meletius had the support of many proponents of Nicene theology at Antioch, Lucifer put his support behind the Eustathian party which had unflinchingly stood by the Nicene creed, and prolonged the schism between Meletians and Eustathians by consecrating without licence a Eustathian, Paulinus, as bishop. He subsequently returned to Cagliari where, according to Jerome, he died in 370.\n\nHe may have been excommunicated as is hinted in the writings of Ambrose of Milan and Augustine of Hippo, as well as Jerome, who refers to his followers as Luciferians. There is extant a work known as \"Libellus precum\", which was written by two Luciferian clergy called Faustinus and Marcellinus. Jerome discusses Lucifer and his supporters in his polemic \"Altercatio Luciferiani et orthodoxi\" (\"Altercation of a Luciferian and an Orthodox\"), as well as describing the bishop's career in \"De Viris Illustribus\" (chapter 95).\n\nAlban Butler writes on the life of Athanasius of Alexandria, that Lucifer of Cagliari and some other bishops refused to accept back the bishops who accepted the Arian position. The lapsed, not withstanding their repentance, could no longer be admitted in the rank of bishop or priest. St. Athanasius condemned this excessive severity; and in 362 assembled the Council of Alexandria, at which assisted St Eusebius of Vercelli, in his return from banishment from Thebais, and St. Asterius of Petra. This synod condemned those who denied the divinity of the Holy Ghost, and decreed that the authors of the Arian heresy should be deposed, and upon their repentance received only to the lay-communion; but those prelates who had fallen into it only by compulsion, and for a short time, should, upon their repentance, retain their sees. (Conc. t. vii. pp. 73 and 680.) \n\nAlban Butler writes of the life of Saint Jerome as he reflects on the history of the Council of Alexandria in 362: This indulgence, of forgiveness offered to the repentant Bishops, displeased Lucifer, Bishop of Cagliari, a person famous for his zeal and writings against the Arians, in the reign of Constantius. St. Jerome composed a dialogue against the Luciferians, in which he plainly demonstrates, by the acts of the Council of Rimini, that in it the bishops were imposed upon. Constantius, for the purpose of wearying out the orthodox bishops (Sulpitius Severus says: E.H.., ii, 41), delayed allowing the bishops home, keeping them there for several months until they finally accepted the Sirmian Creed.\n\nLucifer of Cagliari's surviving writings, all of which date from the period of his exile, are directed against Arianism and reconciliation with heresy. His works are written in the form of speeches delivered directly to Constantius and repeatedly address the emperor in the second person throughout. His main writings are \"Moriundum esse pro Dei filio\" (The Necessity of Dying for the Son of God), \"De non conveniendo cum haereticis\" (On not Coming Together with Heretics), \"De regibus apostaticis\" (On Apostate Kings), \"De non parcendo in Deum delinquentibus\" (On not Sparing those who Commit Offences Against God) and the two books of \"Quia absentem nemo debet iudicare nec damnare, sive De Athanasio\" (That No One Ought to be Judged or Condemned while Absent, or Concerning Athanasius). His texts quote extensively from the Bible and so are useful as sources for the Vetus Latina. Also extant is a pair of letters which are allegedly correspondence between Lucifer and the emperor's secretary Florentius on the subject of some of Lucifer's inflammatory works that he had sent to Constantius.\n\nLucifer's status as a Saint is a matter of controversy. According to John Henry Blunt's 1874 \"Dictionary of Sects, Heresies, Ecclesiastical Parties, and Schools of Religious Thought\",\n\nA chapel in Cagliari's cathedral is dedicated to a Saint Lucifer. Marie Josephine Louise of Savoy, wife of Louis XVIII of France, is buried there.\n\nOpinions about Lucifer vary among Catholics who know of him; some consider him to have been \"the champion of correct belief against Arianism and friend of St. Athanasius,\" while others consider him to have been a religious fanatic who ferociously berated his opponents.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1919819", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1919819", "title": "O'Connell Center", "text": "O'Connell Center\n\nThe Stephen C. O'Connell Center, also known as the O'Dome, is a 10,133-seat multi-purpose arena located on the University of Florida campus in Gainesville, Florida. The facility is named for the sixth president of the university, Stephen C. O'Connell, who served from 1967 to 1973. The facility is located on the northern side of the university's campus, between its football field, Ben Hill Griffin Stadium at Florida Field, and its baseball field, McKethan Stadium.\n\nThe entire facility was known as the O'Connell Center from 1980 until 2016. The building underwent a major $64.5 million renovation / reconstruction during that year, and Exactech, a Gainesville medical firm, signed a $5.9 million, 10-year naming rights deal for the main arena, which was officially renamed the Exactech Arena at the Stephen C. O'Connell Center.\n\nThe Exactech Arena at the O'Connell Center is the home arena of several of the university's Florida Gators intercollegiate sports teams, including the men's and women's college basketball, gymnastics, swimming and diving, and volleyball teams.\n\nThe facility was quickly dubbed the \"O'Dome\" by students, a nickname that is still in use. \"ESPN The Magazine\" nicknamed it the \"House of Horrors\" in 1999, a name that the sports teams began using promotionally a few years later. The student section of the stadium has been dubbed the \"Rowdy Reptiles\". ESPN commentator Dick Vitale, on assignment at the Florida-Kentucky game in 2006, said that the Rowdy Reptiles make the O'Dome one of the toughest places to play in college basketball.\n\nOn December 23, 2006, a then-record crowd of 12,621 watched the fifth-ranked Gators defeat the third-ranked Ohio State Buckeyes, 86–60. The two teams would meet again that season for the National Championship game, with the Gators, once again, emerging victorious as the first back-to-back National Champions since Duke in the early 1990s. This attendance record was broken, however, on February 5, 2011 in a 70–68 Gator victory over the 11th-ranked Kentucky Wildcats, as 12,633 attended the game.\n\nIn addition to sports, the O'Connell Center regularly hosts many other events on campus. It is the largest concert venue in North Central Florida and has been the venue for a wide variety of performances, included a 2006 show by Gainesville native Tom Petty that aired on PBS's Soundstage TV series. Other events held at the facility include University of Florida graduation ceremonies, trade shows, career fairs, political rallies, public speeches, and various large banquets and private events.\n\nConcerts:\n\nFull House: 7,000\n\nIn the Round: 10,500\n\nSpeaking Engagements:\n\nHalf House (standard set): 2,500-3,500\n\nFull House: 6,000-7,000\n\nAthletics:\n\nMen’s Basketball: 10,136\n\nWomen’s Basketball: 10,136\n\nVolleyball: 10,136\n\nGymnastics: 9,251\n\nBanquets:\n\nUp to 1,200\n\nTrade Shows:\n\nService Level: 110 (8 ft X 10 ft booths)\n\nConcourse Level (non-Arena): 140 (8 ft X 10 ft booths)\n\nTotal Exhibition Booths: 250\nBefore the O'Connell Center, the University of Florida's basketball teams and other indoor sports programs used the on-campus Florida Gymnasium, which was nicknamed Alligator Alley. The Florida Gym was built in 1949, and it was considered a difficult venue for opponents because the seating was very close to the court and, when full, the noise level was \"deafening\". However, it was also small, un-air conditioned, and had very few amenities, and it was compared to a \"dismal and dreary\" high school gym by observers. By the early 1970s, Florida was the only school in the Southeastern Conference without a modern basketball facility, a factor that affected the recruiting of top players and held back the growth of its long-mediocre basketball program.\n\nIn 1975, the University of Florida Athletic Association decided to seek funds to build a new facility for UF's indoor sports programs. The University of South Florida (USF) in Tampa had also decided to build a large indoor arena at about the same time, so the schools agreed to commission a common architectural design to stretch limited state funding. As originally constructed, USF's Sun Dome (now known as the Yuengling Center) and UF's O'Connell Center featured almost identical inflatable roof systems and main arenas. The primary difference was that the O'Connell Center included training areas and facilities for other sports around the main arena while USF added these facilities to the Sun Dome in a later expansion.\n\nThe $15.6 million O'Connell Center broke ground in October 1977 in a parking lot across the street from Florida Field. Construction was delayed on both the Sun Dome and the O'Connell Center when cracks appeared in precast concrete support beams. The problems were fixed after several months, and the sister facilities were completed within a few weeks of each other in late 1980 – the Sun Dome in November and the O'Connell Center in December.\n\nThe first event at the Stephen C. O'Connell Student Activities Center (as it was originally known) was a Florida men's basketball game held on December 30, 1980. It was officially dedicated a few weeks later in January 1981.\n\nThe new arena had an immediate positive effect on Florida's men's basketball program, and its first recruit was former coach Norm Sloan. Sloan had been Florida's coach in the 1960s but had left for North Carolina State, winning a national championship with the Wolfpack in 1974. He returned to Florida in 1980 and was thus the Gators' coach during the first season played in the new O'Connell Center. Sloan explained that he had \"enjoyed it tremendously when I was here before, and I always felt that if Florida had the proper facility, I would consider coming back.\" Playing in their new arena under Sloan, the Gators consistently improved and eventually made their first NCAA Tournament in 1986, setting the stage for greater success under subsequent coaches in the years to come.\n\nThe O'Connell Center was envisioned as a competition and practice facility for most of the university's indoor sports programs, and this has been the case throughout its existence. The large () Exactech Arena is the core of the building, and is surrounded by a basketball practice court, a natatorium, as well as gymnastics practice facilities.\n\nWhen it first opened, the O'Connell Center had an inflatable Teflon roof and a system of blowers and air handlers that kept the inside air pressure high enough to hold the flexible roof in place. This higher air pressure was not noticeable inside of the facility, but opening a door to the outside would result in a rush of air escaping the building, so revolving doors were installed at each of the four main gates to lessen the loss of pressure as thousands of fans entered or exited. Maintenance costs for the inflation system rose over the years, and as part of a $10 million renovation in 1998, the roof was replaced with a more conventional hard shell dome. Though no longer in use, the old blowers and duct work for the inflation system remained in place until the facility was extensively renovated again in 2016.\n\nAfter the 1998 redesign of the roof, the facility underwent a smaller renovation in 2006, when the university updated some of the fold-able seating and replaced the four scoreboards located above Gates 1 through 4 in each corner of the arena. The old dot matrix boards were removed and replaced by modern video boards that could display instant replays and video presentations. Following the men's basketball team's victory in the national title game of the 2006 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament, the University Athletic Association (UAA) bought the temporary hardwood floor that had been installed in the now-demolished Indianapolis RCA Dome for the Final Four. Although the national finals logos were removed by sanding, the basketball teams play on the same lumber on which the Gators won their first basketball national championship from 2011 to 2016. The UAA also bought the court used to win their second title from the Georgia Dome in 2007, and displayed it in the O'Connell Center during their championship celebration event, and later sold it in pieces to raise funds for scholarships.\n\nIn March 2016, the O'Connell Center began a $64.5 million reconstruction / renovation project which included major updates to its layout and design. Led by contractors from Brasfield & Gorrie, the entire interior area of the arena, excluding foundation work, was demolished and rebuilt with the addition of a large hanging scoreboard and a luxury club with box seats. Locker rooms and meeting rooms were upgraded, swimming and gymnastics areas were revamped, and a \"grand entrance\" was built facing Ben Hill Griffin Stadium across the street, among many other improvements. When it reopened in December 2016, a naming rights deal with local medical firm Exactech changed the name of the main arena to the Exactech Arena at the Stephen C. O'Connell Center.\n\n"}

Tucker Civic Center, is a multi-purpose indoor arena located on the Florida State University campus in Tallahassee, Florida. The arena has the biggest capacity of any arena in the Florida Panhandle. The arena opened in 1981 and was built at a cost of over $30 million, financed by the city. In 2013, the venue was purchased by the Florida State University Board of Trustees. The facility is located on the southeastern side of the university's campus, between the FSU College of Law and the future home of the FSU College of Business.\n\nThe arena is also located on the \"Madison Mile\", an economic development that connects the venue and Doak Campbell Stadium.\n\nThe arena is home to the Florida State Seminoles men's basketball and Florida State Seminoles women's basketball teams. Covering , this versatile Arena can accommodate 1,000 people for banquets and receptions for up to 2,000. The arena has upholstered seats for sporting events, concerts, touring Broadway productions and family shows. The arena can increase the capacity with risers. Risers are usually added on to the side of the arena wall blending in perfectly with the permanent seats. Risers are usually only given out to the events of wrestling, basketball and sometimes, concerts. The arena can be configured in a variety of seating arrangements for each type of event.\n\nAs a concert venue, the arena can seat between 2,372 and 12,041. As a convention center, it can accommodate 18,900 square feet (1760 m²) in the main arena plus 35,000 square feet (3300 m²) at the adjoining exhibit hall, in addition to 16,000 square feet (1500 m²) of space at the meeting rooms. Concerts, sporting events, trade shows, Broadway shows, conventions, ice shows, circuses, and other events are held here annually.\n\nThe Centre Theater is a 6,000-seat theater configuration used for small concerts, preaching and other theater type events. The theater provides not only a traditional counterweight system for shows accustomed to a conventional theatre venue, but also a perfect setting for musical artists that prefer a more intimate performance space. It is equipped with a state-of-the-art sound system capable of providing reinforcement for upper level and club seat fill, as well as motorized clusters that may be utilized for additional support. The Centre Theater has been proud to host the Tallahassee Broadway Series for the last 11 years and has presented such tours as \"Les Misérables\", \"Riverdance\", \"Cats\", \"Beauty and the Beast\", \"Chicago\", \"Fosse\" and \"Rent\". In addition, numerous musical artists have chosen to perform in this configuration.\n\nPrior to the summer of 2014, much of the existing infrastructure and equipment in use had been there since the arena opened in 1981. This included some equipment that was so outdated that it couldn't be replaced. Further deferred maintenance occurred while the arena was owned by Leon County and the City of Tallahassee.\n\nFSU gave the arena a major renovation during the summer of 2014. The arena received new seats, Jumbotrons including new LED ribbon boards, and a new floor, all at the cost of $10 million. Before then, the only renovation occurred in 1998, when the facility's roof was replaced.\n\nThe arena was named the Donald L. Tucker Civic Center in 1977 in honor of Donald L. Tucker, Esq., a former Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives and Special Ambassador for the United States to the Dominican Republic. Upon opening, the venue was named the Tallahassee-Leon County Civic Center. In 2001, the Florida Senate proposed reverting the civic center to its original name; however, this provision was vetoed. The center reverted to its original name in January 2012. The venue was owned by the Tallahassee Leon County Civic Center Authority until 2012.\n\nThe Civic Center has been the home to many sports teams. It has had WCW Thunder, WWF SmackDown! and WWE Live Events, including men's and women's basketball tournaments. It is also home to the Florida State Seminoles men's and women's basketball teams. Before they moved, it was also host to the Tallahassee Tiger Sharks ice hockey team of the ECHL. Other professional teams that called the center home included the Tallahassee Thunder of AF2 and the Tallahassee Scorpions soccer team of the EISL. In 2007 it was home to the Tallahassee Titans of the American Indoor Football Association. The team then left the AIFL for the World Indoor Football League but then folded after the owner failed to acquire enough capital to finance the team. The WIFL then folded as other members jumped to other leagues. The Tallahassee Tigers were a planned ABA team that could not find a home in the arena due to the Seminoles' basketball season conflicting with the Tigers' schedule. As a result, the team never made their anticipated 2007 debut in the ABA.\n\n\n\n"}

With 50,865 seats, it is the largest stadium in Austria. It was built between 1929 and 1931 for the second Workers' Olympiad to the design of German architect Otto Ernst Schweizer. The stadium was renamed in honour of Austrian footballer Ernst Happel following his death in 1992. The stadium hosted seven games in UEFA Euro 2008, including the final which saw Spain triumph over Germany.\n\nThe stadium is owned by the City of Vienna (Municipal Department 51 – Sports of the City of Vienna). It is managed by the \"Wiener Stadthalle Betriebs und Veranstaltungsgesellschaft m.b.H.\", a subsidiary of \"Wien Holding\". It is a UEFA Category 4 stadium, and as such, it is the home of the Austrian national team. It also hosts the Viennese clubs' games in Europa League.\n\nThe stadium is served by Stadion station on the U2 metro line.\n\nThe foundation stone was laid in November 1928 in honor of the 10-year celebration of the Republic of Austria. The stadium was constructed in 23 months, from 1929 to 1931. It was built according to a design by the Tübingen architect Otto Ernst Schweizer and the second Workers' Olympiad. Schweizer also designed the adjacent Stadionbad (with 400,000 sq m, Europe's largest swimming pool). According to its location in Vienna's Prater, it was initially named Prater Stadium. It was a modern stadium at the time, particularly in Europe, because of its short discharge time of only 7 to 8 minutes. Initially the stadium had a capacity of approximately 60,000 people.\n\nDuring the National Socialist Era following Anschluss, (1938–1945) the stadium was used as a military barracks and staging area and as a temporary prison for the deportation of Jewish citizens. Between September 11 and 13, 1939, after the attack on Poland, over a thousand Polish-born Viennese Jews were detained on the orders Reinhard Heydrich. They were imprisoned beneath the grandstands in the corridors of Section B. On September 30, 1,038 prisoners were deported to the Buchenwald concentration camp. The next day, the stadium was back to being used for a football match. 44 men were released in early 1940, 26 were freed in 1945, the rest were murdered in the camps. In 1988, one of the surviving victims, Fritz Klein, was awarded a compensation by the Austrian government equivalent to 62,50 euros for being detained in the stadium. In 2003 a memorial plaque, commemorating these events, was unveiled in the VIP area by a private initiative. In 1944, the stadium was severely damaged during a bomb attack on the Wehrmarcht Staff offices.\n\nAfter the war and the reconstruction of the stadium, it was again sporting its original use. In 1956, the stadium's capacity was expanded to 92,708 people by Theodor Schull, but in 1965 the capacity was reduced. The attendance record was 91,000 spectators set on October 30, 1960 at the football match between Spain and Austria (0–3).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, the stands were covered and fully equipped with seats. At its reopening a friendly match against archrivals Germany was organised. Austria won the match 4–1. After the death of former Austrian top player and coach Ernst Happel, the Prater Stadium was renamed after him in 1992.\nIn 1964, 1987, 1990, and 1995, the Ernst Happel Stadium was the venue of the European Cup/UEFA Champions League final.\n\nIn 1970, the stadium was the venue of the 1970 European Cup Winners' Cup Final which saw Manchester City F.C. beat Górnik Zabrze by 2 goals to 1 in an entertaining match. Neil Young and a Francis Lee penalty sealed the win for City. This final was played under torrential rain in what was then an uncovered stadium. This along with the fact no Polish supporters were allowed to travel to the match restricted the attendance, which is variously reported at between 7,900 and 15,000 spectators. Even so, City's travelling support numbered over 4,000 which was a then record for an English club playing on the continent.\n\nDuring the UEFA Euro 2008 tournament, the Ernst Happel Stadium was the venue for the Final match. Previously, the three group matches of the Austrian National Team, two quarter finals and a semifinal match took place in the stadium. In preparation for the tournament, the first and second place additional rows of seats increased the stadium's capacity to 53,000 seats.\n\nLeading up to the tournament, it was fitted with a heated pitch in the summer of 2005. In May 2008, a connection to the Vienna U-Bahn was established, easing access from all over the city. The cost of the rebuilding was €39,600,000.\nThe following games were played at the stadium during the UEFA Euro 2008:\n\nThe Ernst Happel Stadium is the largest football stadium in Austria. It is the home of the Austrian national football team. Club football matches are generally limited to the domestic cup final and international competitions featuring one of Vienna's top clubs, FK Austria Wien and SK Rapid Wien, as their regular stadiums are too small to host UEFA Champions League and UEFA Cup matches. Vienna derby matches between FK Austria and SK Rapid have also been played in the stadium.\n\nThe stadium is rated one of UEFA's Five Star Stadiums permitting it to host the UEFA Champions League final. The seating capacity was temporarily expanded to 53,008 for the UEFA Euro 2008 championship, with the final played in the stadium. The stadium also hosted 3 group games, 2 quarter-final matches, a semi-final and final. The attendance record of 92,706 for the match against the Soviet Union was in 1960. The capacity has since been reduced.\n\n\nOther sporting events are held in the stadium, including athletics, cycling and tennis. In 1950, 35,000 watched Austrian Josef Weidinger win the European Heavyweight crown against Stefan Olek (of France), and a temporary pool in the stadium was the venue for the 1995 European LC Championships.\n\nOn July 16, 2011, the American Football World Championship final took place where USA defeated rivals Canada with a score of 50–7 in front of 20,000 spectators.\n\nIn June 6 and 7, 2014, the three game of the final stage of the 13th European Championship of American Football took place in this stadium.\n"}
{"id": "1919833", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1919833", "title": "Stegeman Coliseum", "text": "Stegeman Coliseum\n\nStegeman Coliseum is a 10,523-seat multi-purpose arena in Athens, Georgia, United States. The arena opened in 1964. It is home to the University of Georgia Bulldogs basketball and gymnastics teams. It was also the venue of the rhythmic gymnastics and preliminary indoor volleyball matches during the 1996 Summer Olympics, as well as the 1989, 1995, and 2008 NCAA gymnastics championships. As a multi-purpose facility, the Coliseum also hosted a variety of other kinds of events, including many large indoor rock concerts during its early history, as well as the university's Graduate School commencement exercises. At its opening it replaced Woodruff Hall, a 3,000-seat field house built in 1923.\n\nThe ceiling is barrel-shaped, with the Sanford Drive side being curved as well. The resulting inside seating is in a \"U\" shape, with the flat end, which includes the scoreboard, not having the upper levels of seating. The Sanford Drive side was decorated with the Olympic insignia and other markings for the 1996 Olympics. Also, the roof is a separate structure from the coliseum itself, and is connected by an aluminum bellows which allows the roof to rise and fall with the temperature. The roof has four outward supports in an arc style, which were often used in fraternity initiations until gated off.\n\nThe former Georgia Coliseum received its current name on March 2, 1996, in honor of Herman Stegeman, a longtime basketball coach at UGA who was a pioneer in the development of the original Southern Conference basketball tournament in 1921.\n\nThe university has undertaken several renovations. Originally, Stegeman Coliseum had a stage at one end. Today, a scoreboard, a new section for student seating and banners commemorating the accomplishments of the teams that call Stegeman Coliseum home occupy that space. In anticipation of the 1996 Olympic Games, Stegeman Coliseum received new scoreboard systems, including the first video replay board in an SEC basketball venue. In 2000, all of the old, wooden seats in the lower level were removed, the concrete was resealed, and new cushioned seats were installed. More recently, new LED \"ribbon\" boards have been installed around the upper ring of the Coliseum (not a 360-degree ribbon but three segments of ribbon on each of the non-video-board sides). The building has also undergone several cosmetic changes to the exterior in the past few years. Currently, the university has preliminary plans to undertake a drastic overhaul of the building, including dropping the event level down several feet to increase capacity. In October 2006, an adjoining practice facility for men's and women's basketball and gymnastics was finished.\n\nThe Coliseum underwent a $13 million expansion and renovation after the 2009–10 season. The main concourse level of approximately was fully renovated, including modernization and addition of restrooms, upgrades to concession area, a new merchandising area, a first aid room, a new ticket sales area, and new graphics and way finding signage. Also included were of expanded lobby space (including both sides) and of renovated concourse, restrooms, and concessions. Renovations began on May 12, 2010, and were functionally complete in time for the 2010–11 basketball season. The expansion was officially dedicated on January 18, 2011.\n\nGeorgia upset arch-rival Georgia Tech in the Coliseum's first game on February 22, 1964, 81–68, under the leadership of head coach Harbin \"Red\" Lawson. The inaugural game set an attendance record of 13,200 that has never been surpassed. The original design afforded the Coliseum 11,200 seats, but in the excitement of the opening of \"The Jewel of North Georgia\", officials let anyone come inside that showed up. This would be the first and the last time that this was done.\n\nThe Coliseum also hosted the Mideast Regional of the 1971 NCAA men's basketball tournament. The Western Kentucky Hilltoppers won the regional with an 81–78 win in overtime over the Ohio State Buckeyes. At the close of the 2014-2015 season, Georgia's men's basketball teams had amassed a home record of 484 wins and 221 losses (.686). \n\nOn April 13–16, the arena hosted the inaugural FIRST Robotics Competition Peachtree District State Championship. 41 teams from the state of Georgia attended the championship, with Global Dynamics, East Cobb Robotics and Walton Robotics winning the event. In addition, Kell Robotics won the District Championship Chairman's Award, one of the most prestigious awards in the FIRST Robotics Competition. They, along with 8 other teams, qualified for the 2016 FIRST Championship\n\n\n"}

It opened in 1976, as the home of the UNI Panthers basketball and football teams. The facility's capacity for football is 16,324. For basketball, its official capacity is 16,324; however, it has seated as many as 22,000 for events such as the 1990 Mid-Continent Conference men's basketball tournament and the 1997 NCAA Division I National Wrestling Championships. It has been the home of the Iowa State High School football championships, since 1976 and has hosted junior college football bowl games, wrestling, track and field, softball, concerts and conventions.\n\nIn 1994, the air-supported roof collapsed in a snowstorm. Since this had occurred on numerous occasions before, it was replaced by a more permanent metal roof. Prior to November 18, 2006, the basketball, volleyball and wrestling team used the UNI-Dome, before the construction of the McLeod Center. The McLeod Center is directly south of the UNI-Dome and connected by a covered walkway. The UNI-Dome attendance record for football is 17,190, which was set on October 17, 2009, during a Panthers homecoming game against the Missouri Valley rival Southern Illinois.\n\nThe UNI-Dome's roof was most recently renovated in late summer 2010 due to damages during a high wind storm in July 2009. The cost of the renovation was close to $4 million. The storm knocked down trees, power lines and roofs all over Cedar Falls. The University of Northern Iowa campus lost 20% of its 100+-year-old trees that cover the campus.\n\nThe UNI-Dome received a new HD video board for the start of the 2008 football season. The board replaced an aging, and many times malfunctioning video board. Much of the cost of the new video board was donated by the Iowa High School Athletic Association, which hosts their state football semi-finals and finals in the UNI-Dome each year for all classes. Northern Iowan article\n\nIn 2014, the UNI-Dome had a 100' × 27' video board installed at the south end. The existing video board has replaced the north end scoreboard. All this was made possible with a grant from the Black Hawk Gaming Assoc., plus a very generous gift. This video board is the second largest in FCS football.\n\nA major renovation was also announced in 2014.\n\nOn April 26, 2017, Northern Iowa University Athletics announced that it would be adding AstroTurf to the field of the UNI-Dome. The total cost of the new turf will be approximately $900,000 and will be paid for from previously allocated internal revenue from the university. The AstroTurf is scheduled to be completed prior to the 2017 season.\n\nAt football games, where cold temperatures are frequently an issue for fans, the UNI-Dome announcers have a tradition during pre-game rituals. The announcers will announce the weather in the town where the visiting team is from, and then will say \"The temperature in Cedar Falls, no wind, 72°, Welcome to the UNI-DOME!\" to emphasize the fact that a domed stadium is not affected as much by the weather. In 2016, the university celebrated 40 years of history inside the Dome. As of December 1, 2019, the Panthers have a home record of 220–56–1, having won nearly 80 percent of their games in the dome.\n\nDuring the academic year, during hours when the athletic teams are not using the Dome, it is open to the public. Many students and others with UNI connections will come to the Dome to run or walk the stairs and the concourse. The UNI-Dome has hosted graduation ceremonies as well. Perhaps the most notable ceremony was in the spring of 2011, when first lady Michelle Obama delivered the headlining address.\n\nThe Dome has also hosted professional wrestling events, as well as concerts by bands such as Rolling Stones, The Who, Grateful Dead, Mötley Crüe, REO Speedwagon, Fleetwood Mac, 3 Doors Down, Fuel, The Police and UB40 in 1983, Pink Floyd, Oleander, Taylor Swift, Luke Bryan, Jason Aldean (2015), Kenny Chesney, Florida Georgia Line, Nelly and Garth Brooks who set the UNI-Dome attendance record when he performed before 24,000-plus spectators in 2019.\n\n"}
{"id": "1919836", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1919836", "title": "Plough Lane (1912–98)", "text": "Plough Lane (1912–98)\n\nPlough Lane was a football stadium in Wimbledon, south west London. For nearly eighty years it was the home ground of Wimbledon Football Club, from September 1912 until May 1991, when the club moved their first team home matches to Selhurst Park as part of a groundshare agreement with Crystal Palace. Both clubs' reserve teams then used Plough Lane as their home ground until 1998, when the site was sold to Safeway. Whilst site redevelopment plans were negotiated, the stadium remained derelict for several years until it was finally demolished in 2002. The site then became a private housing development known as Reynolds Gate, completed in 2008.\n\nPlans to build a new stadium for AFC Wimbledon on the nearby site of the Wimbledon Greyhound track, approximately 200 yards from the original Plough Lane stadium, were approved by Merton Council in December 2015. Construction on the 'New Plough Lane' began in 2018.\n\nThe leasehold on the disused marshland at the corner of Plough Lane and Haydons Road was purchased by Wimbledon Football Club in 1912. The pitch was consequently fenced in and the playing surface improved, while a dressing room was built. A stand holding 500 spectators was erected, and Wimbledon played their first match at the ground on 7 September 1912, a friendly match against Carshalton Athletic which was drawn 2–2. Improvements continued to be made to the ground during the First World War, and Plough Lane soon became the pride of the club — in 1918, Vice-president A. Gill Knight boasted that the club had \"the finest ground in the southern district\".\n\nDuring the 1920s, crowds were regularly taken at between five and eight thousand. The South Stand was added in 1923, purchased from Clapton Orient. The terrace in front of the North Stand was improved during 1932–33, and by the start of the Second World War the ground's capacity stood at 30,000. The ground was even used as the site of an amateur international match, when England took on Wales on 19 January 1935. However, damage caused during the Second World War meant that extensive redevelopment was necessary after the club returned in 1944 — the South Stand had been bombed, and the incomplete fencing meant the club could not charge for admission. Half-time collections were taken to keep the club operating.\n\nThe South Stand was restored to its former glory in 1950, and 1950–51 saw the capacity back around the 25,000 mark. Glass panels were fitted at each end of both stands two years later, at the cost of £90, 8s — a sum equivalent to £ in 2009. Floodlights were purchased in July 1954, and the North Stand was completely rebuilt before the 1957–58 season. The ground's freehold was purchased from Merton Borough Council by chairman Sydney Black for £8,250 in November 1959, and then donated to the club. Black announced at the same time that the floodlights purchased five years earlier would be erected on eight pylons the next year at the cost of £4,000. Due to inflation, the price paid by Black for the stadium would have been equal to £ in 2009 — this became significant as one of the conditions of the sale of the ground was the insertion of a pre-emption clause stating that if the site was ever to be used for any purpose other than sport, the Council would have the right to buy the ground back for the same price it had been paid, regardless of inflation. As the pound sterling's value decreased over the years, this clause became a double-edged sword — it protected the club from asset strippers, but also meant that the stadium's value could never grow above the £8,250 that Black had paid in 1959.\n\nThe first match under the new floodlights took place on 3 October 1960, in a London Charity Cup match against Arsenal. Arsenal beat Wimbledon 4–1. The ground remained largely unchanged until the club's election to the Football League, though during 1971–72 an attempt was made to start a market on the club's grounds to raise funds. The High Court ruled that this plan contravened a statute decreed by Charles I in 1628 forbidding any market within seven miles of Kingston upon Thames's market— the court reckoned the distance to be five and a half miles, so no market was built. Despite election to the Football League in 1977 and subsequent success, the club was still plagued by financial trouble. To try and ease the strain on the club, in April 1983 Wimbledon bought out the preemption clause inserted back in 1959 for £100,000. A year later, they sold the ground to club chairman Sam Hammam for £3 million.\n\nFollowing the publication of the Taylor Report in 1990, which introduced new safety measures for football stadia including the regulation that the stadia of teams at the highest level be made all-seater by August 1994, the board of the club decided that Plough Lane could not be economically redeveloped to meet the new standards. The work required to modernise Plough Lane would have been difficult and expensive, but not impossible as the board claimed. A supposedly temporary groundshare with Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park was announced the same year, to begin from the start of the 1991–92 season. This arrangement was only expected to last for a few seasons, but it would ultimately last for 12 years and would end in a very different fashion to what might have been expected at the outset. Wimbledon's final first team match at Plough Lane came on 4 May 1991, coincidentally against Crystal Palace. 10,002 spectators saw Crystal Palace beat Wimbledon 3–0, before swarming onto the pitch to bid farewell to the ground.\n\nPlans to build a new 20,000-seat stadium in the London Borough of Merton had been approved by the local council in 1988, but the club did not follow this up and the stadium was never built. A public park was later established on its planned site.Over the next decade, numerous options for a new stadium to be built in either the London Borough of Merton or elsewhere were explored, including a controversial plan to relocate to Dublin] in the Republic of Ireland, which emerged in 1995. \n\nFinally, Wimbledon relocated to Milton Keynes some 70 miles away in 2003, in a controversial move which had been approved the previous year and sparked the creation of AFC Wimbledon by a section of the club's disgruntled fans. The original Wimbledon club was renamed Milton Keynes Dons in 2004. The new Wimbledon club started life in the Combined Counties League and reached the Football League in 2011.\n\nEven after the departure of the Wimbledon first team, Plough Lane continued to be used by both Wimbledon and Crystal Palace as the home ground for their reserve teams' home matches. This was the case until 1998, when Sam Hammam sold the ground to supermarket chain Safeway. Safeway sought to build a supermarket on the site for four years but, after local residents' opposition and local authority objections to their plans, gave up in 2002. They demolished the stadium during the summer of that year and subsequently sold the vacant site to David Wilson Homes in November 2002. Planning permission was granted to the developer in October 2005 to build 570 flats, and the development was completed in 2008. Following lobbying by Wimbledon supporters, the development agreed to adopt a Wimbledon Football Club theme, with the entire site named \"Reynolds Gate\" after former player Eddie Reynolds. The six individual blocks that comprise the development were also named after former players, managers and a chairman: Bassett House, Batsford House, Cork House, Lawrie House, Reed House and Stannard House.\n"}

It is home to West Virginia University Mountaineers sports teams, including the men's and women's basketball teams, men's wrestling, and women's volleyball and gymnastics. There is also a weight room located in the lower level of the Coliseum. The arena has nearly 100 offices, 13 lecture and seminar rooms, a dance studio, safety lab, racquetball and squash courts, and the Jerry West Mountaineer Room, which holds nearly 150 people for meetings. The arena also has more than 1,000 individual locker units in various dressing rooms available for students and staff.\n\nThe Coliseum has been used for music concerts but the concrete roof has poor sound distribution properties, so other venues in town are more appropriate for this purpose. The poor sound quality was purposeful, as it was the intention of the designers to cup the ceiling so that crowd noise generated at basketball games would be directed back to the floor. The seating at the venue was also designed for optimized viewing during sporting events, making the setup for concerts to be not as optimal as other large arenas.\n\nThe first event held at the Coliseum was a Grand Funk Railroad concert in 1970, with the first game then taking place on 1 December 1970. The Coliseum was one of the sites for games of the 1974 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. Other National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) men's Division I college basketball events it has hosted include the ECAC South Region Tournament organized by the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) in 1975 and 1976 and the Atlantic 10 Conference men's basketball tournament in 1984 and 1988.\n\nDuring the 1998-99 season, the Jerry West Lounge, named for WVU and NBA Hall-of-Famer Jerry West, was formally dedicated.

On 31 October 2000, at 23:17 Taipei local time (15:17 UTC), the Boeing 747-412 operating the flight attempted to take off from the wrong runway at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport during a typhoon. The aircraft crashed into construction equipment on the runway, killing 81 of the 179 occupants aboard. Ninety-eight initially survived the impact, but two passengers died later from injuries in a hospital. As of 2020, the accident is the third-deadliest on Taiwanese soil. It was the first fatal accident involving a Boeing 747-400 and the only fatal accident involving the passenger variant, it is also the first and only Singapore Airlines crash to result in fatalities.\n\nThe aircraft involved in the accident was a Boeing 747-412, registered as 9V-SPK with manufacturer's serial number 28023, powered by four Pratt & Whitney PW4056 engines. It was the 1099th Boeing 747 built and had been delivered to Singapore Airlines on 21 January 1997. It was one of two Singapore Airlines 747-412s (The other being 9V-SPL) that was painted in the special Tropical MegaTop Paint Scheme to promote new First and Business Class Items. It had its last maintenance check on 16 September 2000 and had no defects during the inspection and at the time of the accident.\n\nThe captain of the flight was Foong Chee Kong (age 41). He was an experienced pilot with a total of 11,235 recorded flight hours, of which 2,017 of them were in Boeing 747-400 aircraft. The first officer, Latiff Cyrano (age 36), had 2,442 total flight hours, including 552 hours on the Boeing 747-400. The third member of the crew was relief pilot Ng Kheng Leng (age 38) with approximately 5,508 total flight hours, including 4,518 hours on the Boeing 747-400.\n\nAt 15:00 UTC, 23:00 Taipei local time on 31 October 2000, 9V-SPK left Bay B5 during heavy rain caused by Typhoon Xangsane. At 23:05:57, ground control cleared the aircraft to taxi to runway 05L via taxiway SS WC then NP. At 23:15:22, the aircraft was cleared for takeoff on runway 05L. Many carriers in Southeast and East Asia take off during inclement weather.\n\nAfter a six-second hold, at 23:16:36, the crew attempted takeoff on runway 05R – which had been closed for repairs – instead of the assigned runway 05L (which ran parallel to 05R). The captain correctly heard that he needed to take off at 05L, but he turned too soon and lined up with 05R. The airport was not equipped with ASDE, a ground radar that allows the air traffic controllers to monitor aircraft movements on the ground.\nDue to poor visibility in the heavy rain, the flight crew did not see that construction equipment, including two excavators, two vibrating rollers, one small bulldozer, and one air compressor, had been parked on runway 05R. In addition, the runway contained concrete Jersey barriers and pits. About 41 seconds later, the aircraft collided with the machinery and broke into three major pieces. The fuselage was torn in two, and the engines and landing gear separated. A crane tore the left wing from the aircraft, forcing the jet back onto the ground. The nose struck a scoop loader, with a following large fire, destroying the forward section of the fuselage and the wings. Seventy-nine of 159 passengers and four of 20 crew members died in the accident. Many of the dead were seated in the middle section of the aircraft; the fuel stored in the wings exploded and incinerated that section. At 23:17:36, the emergency bell sounded and 41 firefighting vehicles, 58 ambulances, nine lighting units, and 436 personnel were dispatched to assist survivors and extinguish the fire. Chemical extinguishing agents rained on the aircraft at about three minutes after the impact. At 23:35, roughly 10 minutes after the impact, the fire was brought under control. At 23:40, non-airport ambulances and emergency vehicles from other agencies congregated at the north gate. At 00:00 Taipei time on 1 November, the fire was mostly extinguished and the front part of the aircraft was destroyed. Authorities established a temporary command centre.\n\nAt the time of the crash, 179 passengers and crew, including three children and three infants, were on the aircraft. Of the 179 occupants, 83 were killed, 39 suffered from serious injuries, 32 had minor injuries, while 25 were uninjured. Amongst those who perished, there were four crew members. 81 passengers and crew died on impact immediately after the crash and two passengers died at a hospital.\n\nThe passengers mostly consisted of Taiwanese and Americans.\n\nAmongst the Singaporeans who perished were Elma Thwaites, mother of Singapore Turf Club horse-trainer Malcolm Thwaites; Dr. Sung Kah Kay (), assistant professor of the National University of Singapore's Department of Computer Science; Dr. Sung's wife, Jennifer Loo Tak Wing; and Captain Lim Kim Hock, a Republic of Singapore Air Force pilot on his way to the Air National Guard to attend the Advanced Fighter Weapons Instructor Course. In addition, four of the dead were Motorola employees. \nAmongst perished passengers of other nationalities were the president and two vice-presidents of Buena Park, California-based Ameripec Inc. Kevin Rice, a professor at UC Davis, survived the crash with more than 12% of his body burned, as did John Diaz, a vice-president of MP3.com, who survived the crash with injuries not related to burns. William Wang, who later founded Vizio, survived with only carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\nThe captain, co-pilot and relief pilot originated from Singapore on another SQ 006 flight the day before the accident, rested at a hotel in Taipei, and boarded SQ 006 on 31 October. All three flight crew members survived the crash. The pilot and relief pilot sustained no injuries while the co-pilot received minor injuries. Of the 17 cabin crew members, four died, four received serious injuries, and nine received minor injuries.\n\nOf the passengers, 79 died, 35 received serious injuries, 22 received minor injuries, and 23 were uninjured.\n\nThe aircraft had five first-class passengers, 28 business-class passengers (nine on lower deck and 19 on upper deck), and 126 economy-class passengers. Of the first class passengers, one received a minor injury and four received no injuries. Of the business-class passengers, 14 (two on lower deck, 12 on upper deck) died, two (one on lower deck, one on upper deck) received serious injuries, seven (two on lower deck, five on upper deck) received minor injuries, and eight (four on lower deck, four on upper deck) were uninjured. Of the economy class passengers, 65 died, 33 received serious injuries, 14 received minor injuries, and 11 were uninjured. The lower deck passengers who died were seated in rows 22 through 38. Sixty-four of 76 passengers in the forward economy section were killed by the explosion of the centre fuel tank, which resulted in intense fire. In the upper deck of the business class section, 12 of 19 passengers and one of two flight attendants died due to smoke inhalation and fire; 10 bodies, originating from the upper deck of business class, were found between the stairwell and the 2L exit on the main deck. All passengers in the aft economy section survived.\n\nOf the passengers on the TPE-LAX leg, 77 flew from Singapore and 82 flew from Taipei. Of the passengers originating from Singapore, 37 died. Of the passengers originating from Taipei, 42 died. Of the three male passengers identified as infants, including two Indians originated from Singapore and one Taiwanese originated from Taipei, all three died.\n\nThe Department of Forensic Pathology Institute of Foreign Medicine, Ministry of Justice performed seven autopsies. One person died from impact injuries, and six people died from severe burns. Many passengers on the flight sustained burns since jet fuel splashed onto the passengers.\n\nLin Ming-liang, a 45-year-old Taiwanese passenger bearing burns to more than 86% of his body, died of his injuries at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (), Linkou, Taipei County (now New Taipei City) on Sunday 5 November 2000. Lee Suet Yee, a hospitalised Singaporean woman bearing burns to 95% of her body, died of her injuries in a Taiwanese hospital on 24 November 2000.\n\nDiaz did not receive burns; he received lung damage and \"body shock,\" which resulted in compressed joints with soft tissue damage. When Diaz appeared on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\", he used a walker.\n\nAn investigation into the accident was conducted by the Aviation Safety Council (ASC) of the Republic of China (Taiwan). The final report was issued by the ASC on 24 April 2002. In the report section \"Findings Related to Probable Causes,\" which detailed factors that played a major role in the circumstances leading to the accident, it was stated that the flight crew did not review the taxi route, despite having all the relevant charts, and as a result did not know the aircraft had entered the wrong runway. Upon entering the wrong runway, the flight crew had neglected to check the para visual display (PVD) and the primary flight display (PFD), which would have indicated that the aircraft was lined up on the wrong runway. According to the ASC, these errors, coupled with the imminent arrival of the typhoon and the poor weather conditions, caused the flight crew to lose situational awareness and led them to attempt to take off from the wrong runway.\n\nImmediately after the accident occurred, James Boyd, a Singapore Airlines spokesperson in Los Angeles, stated that no fatalities occurred in the crash; the airline statement was later revised to state that fatalities occurred.\n\nThe airline initially stated that reports of the aircraft taking the wrong runway were untrue before the fact that the wrong runway was used was proven true.\n\nKhan Mahmood, whose sister and parents died in SQ006, criticised the airline for taking too much time to notify relatives.\n\nA counselling centre opened at Los Angeles International Airport to deal with relatives of passengers.\n\nRelatives of victims provided blood samples to identify bodies.\n\nSingapore's Ministry of Transport made several comments on the ASC report.\n\nSingapore Airlines also issued a statement after the release of the ASC report. In their statement, Singapore Airlines reiterated the points brought up by the Singapore investigators and added that air traffic control (ATC) did not follow their own procedure when they gave clearance for SQ006 to take off despite ATC's not being able to see the aircraft. Singapore Airlines also clarified that the para visual display (PVD) was meant to help the flight crew maintain the runway centerline in poor visibility, rather than to identify the runway in use.\n\nThe statement by Kay Yong (), managing director of the Republic of China's Aviation Safety Council, implied that pilot error played a major role in the crash of the Boeing 747-400, which led to the deaths of 83 people. He stated that the airport should have placed markers stating that the runway was closed to takeoffs and landings.\n\nRunway 05R was not blocked off by barriers because part of the strip was used by landing planes to taxi back to the airport terminal.\nThe pilot confirmed twice with the control tower that he was on the correct runway; controllers did not know the plane had actually gone on to the wrong runway because the airport lacked ground radar and the plane was out of sight of the tower at the time of its takeoff attempt.\n\nJohn Wiggans, a survivor of the crash, stated in a \"USA Today\" article that the staff were unable to help the passengers escape from the aircraft due to being frozen by fear and/or due to lack of competence in emergency procedures; Wiggans was seated in the upper deck business class area. \"The Straits Times\" carried reports of flight attendants saving lives of passengers. One story from the newspaper stated that Irene Ang Miau Lee () escaped the crash, ran back into the aircraft to attempt to save passengers, and died.\n\n\"The Australian\" reported that some flight attendants helped passengers and some flight attendants fled the aircraft before all passengers were accounted for. Genevieve Jiang of \"The Electric New Paper\" stated that the pilots attempted to help the passengers.\n\nThe Taiwanese report stated that the relief pilot (Crew Member 3, or CM-3) said in an interview that he was the first to leave the cockpit and the last to leave the aircraft A passenger sitting in seat 17A stated that the Right Upper Deck Door flight attendant directed him to the main deck via the stairs. The flight attendant died.\n\nUpper deck passengers and flight attendants stated that the Crew-In-Charge flight attendant (CIC) travelled upstairs after the first impact; the Crew-In-Charge flight attendant died.\n\nThe 3R and 3L flight attendants died; they were seated in the middle of the aircraft.\n\nAfter the release of the ASC report, Republic of China (ROC) public prosecutors called upon the flight crew of SQ006 to return to the ROC for questioning and the three-member crew complied. Rumours abounded at the time that the pilots might be detained in the ROC and charged with negligence. IFALPA had previously stated that it would advise its members of the difficulties of operating into the ROC if the flight crew of SQ006 were prosecuted. The prosecutors did not press charges and the flight crew were allowed to leave the ROC.\n\nThe accident aircraft 9V-SPK was painted in Singapore Airlines special promotion livery, a scheme called \"Tropical\", at the time of the accident. The special livery was intended to promote Singapore Airlines new first class and business class products. After the accident, 9V-SPK's sister aircraft, 9V-SPL, the only other aircraft painted with the promotional livery, was immediately removed from service and repainted with standard Singapore Airlines livery. Since then, the only special livery that Singapore Airlines applies to some of its aircraft outside its standard livery is the Star Alliance livery.\n\nDozens of survivors and relatives of those killed filed lawsuits against the airline and ROC authorities. Despite a Taiwanese High Prosecutor's decision to not prosecute the pilots for the first three years after the crash, Singapore Airlines subsequently fired the captain and first officer in 2002.\n\nThe Association of Asian American Yale Alumni named the Tina E. Yeh Community Service Fellowship program after Tina Eugenia Yeh, an American who boarded SQ006 in Taipei and died.\n\nBy 8 November 2000, several bodies were scheduled to be repatriated. Of the bodies:\nThe bodies of 14 Taiwanese passengers and the others remained in Taipei to be collected by relatives.\n\nBy 2 November 2000, 40 passengers and crew were hospitalised, of whom 11 were later released that night. On 5 November 2000, 34 passengers and crew remained hospitalised. 64 were discharged from the hospitals. Lin Ming-Liang, a Taiwanese passenger, died that day. On 8 November 2000, 24 passengers and crew remained hospitalised: 20 in the Republic of China (Taiwan), 3 in Singapore and 1 in the United States. The Republic of Singapore Air Force deployed a specially configured KC-135R for the medical evacuation of critical Singaporean victims. 73 survivors, 40 who were not hospitalised and 33 who were discharged, had either returned home or continued with their travel.\n\nThe film \"Thread That Binds\" includes an interview with Farzana Abdul Razak, a surviving flight attendant.\n\nEpisode 3 (\"Caution to the Wind\") of season 12 of the Canadian TV series \"Mayday\" (also known as \"Air Crash Investigation\") documented the whole investigation process.\n\n\n\nAviation Safety Council\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The 15,098-seat arena opened in 1999 and is home to the Texas Tech Red Raiders basketball, Texas Tech Lady Raiders basketball, and Texas Tech Red Raiders women's volleyball teams.\n\nThe City of Lubbock proposed replacing the Lubbock Municipal Coliseum with a new arena named after Buddy Holly. The proposed Buddy Holly Arena was to be located next to the Lubbock Memorial Civic Center in downtown Lubbock, not on the Texas Tech University campus. A public referendum for a tax increase to build the arena failed to pass by as few as 600 votes. Texas Tech decided to move construction to an on-campus facility with private donations on the university's campus.\n\nThe arena was financed from a $500 million fundraising endeavor undertaken by John T. Montford, the first chancellor of the Texas Tech University System. Groundbreaking began on March 26, 1997. The arena opened on October 1, 1999, at a cost of $62.775 million.\n\nWith a total of 15,098 seats, United Supermarkets Arena is slated to become the largest indoor collegiate sports arena in the state, pending the proposed demolition of University of Texas at Austin's Frank Erwin Center in 2021.\n\nThe arena features a Spanish Renaissance exterior facade, matching architectural style of the rest of the Texas Tech University campus. Architects for the project included Joe D. McKay AIA Architects, and Rosser International. Hill International was the project manager, and the general contractor was Centex Construction Co.\n\nStanding at the southeast entrance of the arena is the eight-story Victory Tower. At , Victory Tower is the 16th-tallest structure in Lubbock.\n\nLubbock-based supermarket chain United Supermarkets purchased the naming rights to the facility under a 20-year, $10 million naming-rights agreement with Texas Tech University in 1996. Until 2014, the arena was known as United Spirit Arena. Following a 10-year, $9.45 million naming-rights extension, the arena was renamed United Supermarkets Arena.

He played all or part of eleven seasons in Major League Baseball for the St. Louis Cardinals and Los Angeles Dodgers between 1985 and 1997. During his playing career, Worrell was a three-time National League All-Star.\n\nWorrell was drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1st round of the 1982 MLB draft out of Biola University. He made his MLB debut on August 28, 1985, pitching 1 2/3 scoreless innings in relief against the Cincinnati Reds. He picked up his first save on September 13 against the Chicago Cubs.\nWorrell saved five games down the stretch and compiled an earned run average of 2.91, then pitched effectively in the postseason against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS and the Kansas City Royals in the 1985 World Series. Worrell was the losing pitcher of Game 6 in the latter series, as a blown call by umpire Don Denkinger set up a rally by the Royals and allowed them to win the game in the bottom of the ninth.\n\nWorrell was still eligible as a rookie in 1986, and his 9-10 record with 36 saves netted him that year's National League Rookie of the Year Award, as well as the National League Rolaids Relief Man Award. He was on the mound when the winning run in Game 7 of the 1987 World Series scored, though he was not tagged with the loss as the runner who scored it had been inherited from another pitcher. Worrell became the first relief pitcher to save 30 or more games in each of his first three full seasons.\n\nOn September 4, 1989, Worrell was pitching for his 125th career save, which would have tied him with Bruce Sutter for the Cardinals' career record. While making a pitch, he felt a ligament snap. He underwent elbow surgery in December to repair the damage, then experienced shoulder pain when attempting to come back for the 1991 season and was diagnosed with a rotator cuff tear. As a result, he missed both the 1990 and seasons due to injuries and rehabilitation. Worrell came back in 1992 as a set-up man for veteran Lee Smith.\n\nWorrell signed as a free agent with the Los Angeles Dodgers on December 9, 1992, where he struggled for two seasons before regaining his old form and saving 32, 44, and 35 games in the final three seasons of his career, making two of his three career All-Star appearances and becoming the Dodgers career saves leader. He retired following the 1997 season.\n\nTodd is also the older brother of Tim Worrell, himself a major league pitcher between 1993 and 2006, and also a distant relative of American swimmer Michael Worrell. Both attended Biola University. Todd currently owns and operates Firesteel Creek Hunting Lodge north of Plankinton, South Dakota.\n\nHe has three sons, Josh, Jeremy and Jacob who have all played baseball. Josh played at Indiana Wesleyan University in Marion, Indiana and was drafted in the 30th round of the 2009 MLB draft by the Kansas City Royals. He played three seasons in the low minors. Jeremy and Jacob also played at Indiana Wesleyan University.\n\nTodd is currently the pitching coach at Westminster Christian Academy in St. Louis and also coached for the River City Rascals of the Frontier League.\n\n\n"}

One of Scotland's five National Performing Arts Companies, the SCO performs throughout Scotland, including annual tours of the Scottish Highlands and Islands and South of Scotland. The SCO appears regularly at the Edinburgh, East Neuk, St Magnus and Aldeburgh Festivals and The Proms. The SCO's international touring receives support from the Scottish Government. The SCO rehearses mainly at Edinburgh's Queen's Hall.\n\nThe SCO was formed in 1974, with Roderick Brydon as its first Principal Conductor, from 1974 to 1983. The founding leader of the SCO was John Tunnell, and by 1977 he had been joined by Carolyn Sparey as principal viola, and Haflidi Halgrimsson as principal cello. With Michael Storrs managing the orchestra for much of  its first decade, the schedule, which for a while included work as the orchestra for Scottish Opera, offered a full diary of concert performances, recordings and touring. In 1978 there was a tour to Hungary, Rumania and Bulgaria, as well as the first of two summers as orchestra in residence for the festival in Aix-en-Provence. A year later a tour of the Scottish Highlands and islands was the first of its kind ever to take place on the islands of the West coast of Scotland, and was followed by the official opening by Queen Elizabeth II of the Queen's Hall in Edinburgh on July 6th. A highlight of the year 1980 was a BBC TV recording with Raymond Leppard of all six Brandenburg Concertos and over the next couple of years the relentless schedule continued with concerts in Barcelona, a residency in the Scottish Highlands, performances at the St. Magnus Festival in Orkney, a recording of Vivaldi’s Four Seasons with violinist Jaimie Laredo, tours of the UK and Europe with mezzo soprano Teresa Berganza, concerts with the Polish conductor, Jerzy Maksymiuk, and an introduction to the up and coming young English conductor, Simon Rattle in a concert involving the American opera singer, Jessye Norman. \nOther principal conductors have included Jukka-Pekka Saraste (1987–1991) and Ivor Bolton (1994–1996). The American violinist and conductor Joseph Swensen served as Principal Conductor from 1996 to 2005, and is now the SCO's Conductor Emeritus. Sir Charles Mackerras held the position of Conductor Laureate until his death in 2010. The Estonian conductor Olari Elts served as the SCO's Principal Guest Conductor from October 2007 to September 2010. Robin Ticciati was principal conductor from 2009 through 2018. with an initial contract of 3 years. Emmanuel Krivine became the SCO's principal guest conductor in September 2015.\nIn March 2018, Maxim Emelyanychev first guest-conducted the SCO, as an emergency substitute for Ticciati. Based on this appearance, in May 2018, the SCO announced the appointment of Emelyanychev as its sixth principal conductor, effective with the 2019-2020 season. In November 2019, the SCO announced the extension of Emelyanychev's contract as principal conductor through 2025. \n\nThe SCO's work in contemporary music has included collaborations with Gordon Crosse, John McLeod, and Peter Maxwell Davies, notably the series of Strathclyde Concertos. Einojuhani Rautavaara's \"Autumn Gardens\" received its world premiere with the SCO in 1999. The SCO premiered Sally Beamish's \"Concerto for Orchestra\" (\"Sangsters\") in November 2002.

He was the chairman of Birmingham City Football Club until 2009. Since 2010, he has been the joint chairman of West Ham United.\n\nGold was brought up in East London at 442 Green Street near to West Ham's Boleyn Ground. He played youth team football for West Ham. His father, Godfrey, was an East End criminal, known locally as 'Goldy', who spent time in prison during Gold's early years. His father was Jewish, whereas his mother was a Christian.\n\nGold owns Gold Group International (GGI), the parent company of the retailer Ann Summers and lingerie chain Knickerbox. GGI was jointly owned by Gold and his brother Ralph, until he bought out Ralph's share in 2008.\n\nHe co-owned (with brother Ralph) adult magazine company Gold Star Publications (GSP), including printing and distribution businesses, and a stable of titles including \"Rustler\" and \"Raider\". He and his brother sold their interests in November 2006. In 2007, the brothers also sold their share in Sport Newspapers, following falling sales and profits.\n\nHe owned corporate air service Gold Air International until he sold it in 2006 for £4.4m.\n\nGold is the former chairman of Birmingham City F.C. In 2007 the Gold brothers were believed to be in the process of selling their share in Birmingham City which followed Birmingham's return from relegation and lower than expected profits. After the club was relegated once again to the Championship in May 2008, Gold was quoted as saying he was considering stepping down as joint head of the board of Birmingham City. He sold his Birmingham City shares in 2009.\n\nIn May 2005, Gold bought the second FA Cup trophy at auction for £488,620, saying he wanted to prevent it being bought by overseas buyers.\n\nIn January 2010 Gold and David Sullivan acquired a 50 percent share of West Ham United giving them overall operational and commercial control of the club. They were appointed joint chairmen. They increased their share of the club to 30% each in May 2010 at a cost of £8 million. His time as chairman of West Ham has been conspicuous due to several incidents. In August 2010 his Rolls-Royce Phantom car was attacked by Aston Villa fans outside a pub near Villa Park after West Ham's 3–0 defeat. The car sustained £8,500 worth of damage. He described the incident as \"the most frightening experience of my football life\".\nIn November 2010 Gold criticised Birmingham City's new owners for reneging on their promise to keep him on as chairman following the sale of the club. Birmingham City and their acting chairman, Peter Pannu, responded by banning Gold from their ground St Andrew's for Birmingham City's game against West Ham on 6 November.\nGold later issued a personal apology to Pannu on West Ham's own website.\n\nAfter the campaign against Malcolm Glazer's increase in the debt of Manchester United and Portsmouth going into administration in 2010, Gold has advocated regulating football clubs' debts. He feels it is \"cheating\" for a team to take on debts which they could never pay off without external assistance and that he \"fears for the league\".\n\nIn 1957, Gold married Beryl Hunt. They divorced in 1972 after Gold found her cheating on him with his best friend in his swimming pool, on the same day he caught his father stealing his shares. Hunt died in 2003. They had two children:\n\nIn 2005, Gold wrote his autobiography \"Pure Gold\" with co-writer Bob Harris. This dwells on his early childhood poverty, ascent in business and involvement with Birmingham City.\n\n, he lives with his fiancée Lesley Manning, in Caterham, Surrey.\n\nIn 2013 Gold's wealth was estimated at around £350m according to the Sunday Times Rich List.\n\nFollowing West Ham's move from the Boleyn Ground to the London Stadium in 2016, Gold was subjected to protests from groups of West Ham supporters who were unhappy with the move and who accused Gold of having taken money from the club and of being a \"liar\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1919898", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1919898", "title": "Data Access Language", "text": "Data Access Language\n\nData Access Language, or simply DAL, was a SQL-like language and application programming interface released by Apple Computer in 1990 to provide unified client/server access to database management systems. It was known for poor performance and high costs, something Apple did little to address over its short lifetime, before it was sold off in 1994. DAL is used as the native SQL dialect of the PrimeBase SQL server, as well as the now-defunct Butler SQL.\n\nDAL started as a 3rd-party product, CL/1 (\"Connectivity Language One\"), from a small vendor, Network Innovations. Apple purchased the company in 1988, during a time that client/server databases were becoming a hot issue in the industry. They released their first version of the re-branded software in 1989, for MVS, and followed with other versions over the next year or so.\n\nDAL suffered from most Apple problems of the early 1990s, notably an alternating level of support in which Apple would aggressively promote the product and then ignore it. Throughout, the company struggled with promoting the system as a cross-platform standard, or as a Mac-only technology. DAL's release was also coincident with Apple's fall from grace in the business world, and not coincidentally with Microsoft's ODBC efforts.\n\nDAL appears to have seen little use, and eventually Apple sold it to Independence Technologies in 1994, during a sell-off of a number of \"high-end\" packages such as their X.400 server and an SNA client. Independence Technologies was a middleware vendor, better known as a major reseller of the Tuxedo product for Unix. In 1995 BEA Systems bought the company, and in turn sold it to UniPrise Systems in late 1996. No releases took place during this period.\n\nLike Oracle's PL/SQL or Microsoft's Transact-SQL, DAL is essentially an extended version of SQL supporting basic query functionality and adding clean syntax for cursor operations, logic, and loops.\n\nWhen sent a command, early versions of Apple's DAL interpreter broke down the statement and re-built it into subqueries for the underlying data sources. This translation took place on the server-side, just like PL/SQL and Transact-SQL, but required a fairly expensive \"adaptor\" program of often dubious performance. This adaptor made DAL considerably less appealing than later systems like ODBC, where the translation normally takes place on the client side and is typically included for free with the database engine. The downside to the ODBC approach is that, theoretically at least, more network bandwidth is used up to pull the \"raw data\" to the client machine for processing back into a standard format.\n\nOn the client end, DAL was originally accessed directly through a system extension, but DAL was later rolled into a single ODBC-like driver layer, the Data Access Manager (DAM). DAM was ODBC-like in concept, but did not include the SQL layers, it was strictly a system for sending \"opaque\" queries and receiving result sets. DAM also included the concept of a \"query document\" that allowed the DAL (or other) queries to be written in an authoring system and then easily used in any client application.\n\nOne of the more common clients for DAM was HyperCard. The combination of HyperCard and DAL presented a serious challenge to existing vendors who could offer nothing with a GUI. Apple gave a series of demos of HyperCard/DAL, and soon Oracle Corporation purchased a HyperCard-clone, PLUS from Spinnaker Software, to produce Oracle Card.\n\nFor much of the 1990s a direct-DAL database server was available on the Macintosh, Butler SQL. However, like any server software on the \"classic\" Mac OS, Butler was seriously hampered by the Mac's single-user file system and limited multitasking and could never really deliver the sort of performance the same server would have on Windows NT or Unix.\n\nThe PrimeBase division of German software developer SNAP Innovation GmbH continues to support DAL in their cross platform SQL database server (originally known as P.INK SQL). Their extended version of DAL is called PrimeBaseTalk (PBT) and is fully backward compatible with DAL. Their architecture does not include Data Access Manager and the resulting performance gains are considerable.\n"}

{"id": "1919903", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1919903", "title": "Philippines men's national basketball team", "text": "Philippines men's national basketball team\n\nThe Philippines men's national basketball team () is managed by the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas (Basketball Federation of the Philippines or simply SBP).\n\nThe team won a bronze medal in the 1954 FIBA World Championship, the best finish by any team outside the Americas and Europe. Also, the team took a fifth-place finish in 1936 Summer Olympics, the best finish by any team outside the Americas, Europe and Oceania. The Philippines has the most wins in the Olympics among teams outside the Americas, Europe and Oceania.\n\nAside from the bronze medal at the FIBA World Cup and the fifth-place Olympic finish, the Philippines has won five FIBA Asia Cups (formerly known as the FIBA Asia Championship), four Asian Games men's basketball gold medals, eight SEABA Championships, all but one Southeast Asian Games men's basketball gold medals, and has the most titles in Southeast Asia Basketball Association men's championship, being considered as the powerhouse team in Southeast Asia and one of Asia's elite basketball teams. The country has also participated in five FIBA World Cups and seven Olympic Basketball Tournaments.\n\nThe Philippines first participated in international basketball in the Far Eastern Championship Games in 1913. The Philippines defeated China in what was the first international game in Asia. The Philippines won all but one (1921) championship until 1934. The games were not under the supervision of FIBA as the organization was founded in 1932.\n\nThe Basketball Association of the Philippines (BAP) was founded in 1936, and became a part of FIBA later that year. Also in the same year, the BAP sent a team nicknamed \"the Islanders\" that participated in the first Olympic basketball tournament in Berlin. With the tournament under a single-elimination round format from the third game onwards, the Philippines won their first three games only to face the United States in their fourth game. The USA doubled the Philippines' score as they advanced to the next round, and subsequently win the gold medal undefeated. The Philippines wound up fifth place, winning the rest of their games, in the best finish by an Asian team in Olympic basketball history. Aside from silver medalists Canada, the Philippines was the only other team that only had one loss in the tournament.\n\nThe Philippines returned to the 1948 Olympics in London. The team finished fourth of six teams in their group to be eliminated. The team wound up in twelfth place.\nIn the 1950s–1960s, the Philippines was among the best in the world, producing world-class players like Carlos Loyzaga, Lauro Mumar, Mariano Tolentino, Francisco Rabat and Edgardo Ocampo. In 1951, team won the inaugural Asian Games basketball tournament in New Delhi, India. The team finished ahead of Japan and four other teams to win the gold medal. On the next Asian Games in 1954 in Manila that served as a qualifiers for the World Championship later that year, the team finished first anew, beating out the Republic of China (Taiwan), Japan and South Korea in the final round.\n\nIn 1954 FIBA World Championship in Brazil, Loyzaga was a part of the Mythical Team selection, where the Philippines won the bronze medal. The Philippines finished second in their group behind Brazil and ahead of Paraguay to enter the final round, where the team lost against the US by only 13 points; only the loss against the US and two losses against Brazil were the Philippines' only losses in the world championship. To date, the Philippines' performance remains the best performance by an Asian team in the World Championship.\n\nIn the 1956 Olympics, the Philippines finished seventh. The team qualified to the quarterfinals, with only loss against the USA. However, the team lost all of their games against France, Uruguay and Chile in the quarterfinals. The Philippines defeated Chile in the seventh-place game to finish with a 4–4 record. Two years later, in the 1958 Asian Games in Tokyo, the Philippines won its third consecutive gold medal, finishing first in the final round.\n\nThe Philippines was grouped with Bulgaria, Puerto Rico and Uruguay in the 1959 FIBA World Championship. The team finished third, losing against Bulgaria and Puerto Rico, to crash out of the final round. The Philippines won all of the games in the classification round against the United Arab Republic (Egypt) and Canada to meet Uruguay for the eighth-place game. The team defeated Uruguay again to finish eighth. This would be the last tournament of Loyzaga and company.\n\nStarting in 1960, the Asian Basketball Championship was held to determine Asia's participants in the Olympics and the World Championships. Qualifying for the Asian Championship was by subzone, or by the ranking in the most recent tournament; in this case, with the Philippines being the strongest team in Southeast Asia, the country will qualify easily for the continental championship, even if they failed to qualify via rankings from the previous tournament. The inaugural Asian Championship was held in Manila.\n\nWith an Asian Championship, the Philippines qualified for the 1960 Olympics. In Rome, the Philippines did not qualify for the medal round, but did beat Spain in the preliminaries, ultimately finishing 11th out of 16 nations. The country was supposed to host the 1963 World Championship, but President Diosdado Macapagal refused to allow players from Yugoslavia and other communist countries to enter the country. This caused the Philippines, despite winning the Asian Championships, to qualify via a pre-Olympic tournament, in which they were unsuccessful.\n\nIn the fifth championship at Bangkok, the Philippines finished third, after a one-point loss against Japan, and an 86–95 loss against South Korea.\n\nIn 1975, after disputes with the Basketball Association of the Philippines (BAP), nine teams pulled out of BAP's jurisdiction and founded the professional Philippine Basketball Association (PBA), taking along all the best players with them. This caused the BAP to send weakened teams in the subsequent international tournaments, as professionals are not allowed to play. The Filipinos fail to defend their Asian championship in 1975, with India earning a shock blowout win to deny the Philippines a top-4 finish. The Chinese won the championship, beginning their unbeaten championship run that will last into 1983. The nationals were denied of a top 4 finish in the 1977 Asian Championship, losing this time to Malaysia. The Philippines then hosted the 1978 FIBA World Championship, losing all of the games via blowouts to finish last in the final round.\n\nTo offset the loss of players of the PBA, the BAP delegated to businessman Eduardo Cojuangco, Jr. the formation of a team that will train together for several months, in essence, a club team unaffiliated with any league. The result was the Northern Cement basketball team coached by the American Ron Jacobs that had four naturalized players. In the 1982 Asian Games in New Delhi, the team finished fourth behind Korea, China and Japan. In the 1983 Asian Championship in Hong Kong, the Philippines forfeited their preliminary round games after a misunderstanding in the rules that caused the Philippines to play more than one naturalized player on the floor at the time. The Philippines, without their naturalized players, made short work of the classification round to finish in ninth place. The Northern Cement team won the 1985 Asian Championship in Kuala Lumpur, to qualify for the 1986 FIBA World Championship in Spain.\n\nOn February 22, 1986, the People Power Revolution erupted and forced president Ferdinand Marcos into exile. Cojuangco, a known ally of Marcos, also left the country, causing the team not to participate in the World Championship. The team did participate in the 1986 Asian Games, finishing third behind China and Korea.\n\nIn 1989, FIBA allowed professionals to play in their tournaments. This caused the BAP to have an agreement with the PBA in which the latter will form national teams for the Asian Games, while the former will do so in other tournaments. In the 1989 Southeast Asian Games, the BAP-sponsored team suffered a shock loss to Malaysia in the gold medal game, the only time the Philippines failed to win the gold medal at the Southeast Asian Games in which basketball was played.\n\nIn 1990, the Philippines sent an all-pro national team, coached by Robert Jaworski, to regain the country's basketball supremacy in the Asian Games but the team lost in the final against China and settled for a silver medal. The team includes 1990 PBA Most Valuable Player Allan Caidic and Samboy Lim, who were both selected in the Asian Games Mythical Five Selections.\n\nIn the 1991 Asian Championship in Kobe, Japan, the Philippines finished second in their preliminary round group behind China, but a loss against Japan caused their elimination, ending up in seventh place, when Jordan forfeited the game. In 1993, the Philippines failed to qualify in the quarterfinal groups, suffering losses against Korea (five points) and the UAE (four points) en route to an 11th-place finish.\n\nIn the 1994 Asian Games in Hiroshima, the Philippines, coached by the American Norman Black, sent in a team composed of PBA players and selected amateurs. The team finish second in the preliminary round, losing to Korea. The loss to Korea meant that the Philippines has to face China; despite losing, the Chinese had their slimmest winning margin in the tournament with nine points, en route to their gold medal. The Philippines were upended by the hosts Japan in the bronze medal game, losing by three points in overtime.\n\nWith no PBA players on the roster, the team on the 1995 Asian Championship in Seoul finished last in the preliminary round, but managed to win two games in the classification round to finish 12th out of 19 teams. The team that went to Riyadh for the ABC Championship 1997 did only marginally better; they still finished last in the preliminary round but topped the classification round group en route to a ninth-place finish.\n\nIn 1998, the PBA formed the Philippine Centennial Team coached by the American Tim Cone that captured the 21st William Jones Cup championship but finished with the bronze medal in the 1998 Asian Games held in Bangkok. The Filipinos faced their old nemesis Korea in the quarterfinals and were blown out by twenty points, which led them to face China in the semifinals anew. The result would be the same as four years earlier, with the Chinese winning by nine. The Filipinos won the bronze medal game though, against Kazakhstan.\n\nIn the 1999 Asian Championship in Fukuoka, Japan, the Philippines, with no PBA players on their roster, finished last in the preliminary round, and second in the classification round to finish 11th out of 15 teams. In Shanghai for the 2001 Asian Championship, the Philippines was suspended by FIBA due to leadership disputes at the BAP. This caused the country to miss their first Asian championship. By 2002, a compromise was sorted out, and the Philippines was allowed to participate in the 2002 Asian Games, coached by Jong Uichico.\n\nIn Busan, South Korea, the Philippines easily qualified for the quarterfinals, in which they are grouped with China, Japan and Chinese Taipei. The Philippines won by five points against Japan, and 14 points against Chinese Taipei. The game against China wasn't as close, with the Philippines losing by 41 points, but this assured that they won't have to face China in the semifinals. For the third consecutive time, the Filipinos and Koreans faced in the semifinals, with the same result: the Koreans won over the Philippines, this time by one point. Up by two points, Olsen Racela missed two free throws, that led to a Korean three-pointer at the buzzer to eliminate the Filipinos. The team would lose in the bronze medal game against Kazakhstan by 2 points as Korea defeated China in overtime by a basket to win Asian Games gold for the first time since 1970.\n\nWith no PBA players in the roster, the 2003 Asian Championship in Harbin was the worst performance by the team in history: a 15th-place finish out of 16 teams. Unlike in 1997 and 1999, the Philippines had one win in the preliminary round (against Jordan). However, in the classification round, the Philippines emerged winless in a group containing Syria, Kuwait and Hong Kong. Only a blowout win against Malaysia saved the Philippines from dropping to the cellar. After the championship, BAP was heavily criticized and took steps to strengthen the team. However, after a loss against the Parañaque Jets, a team composed of politicians, actors and amateurs, by the BAP-managed team, another leadership crisis in the BAP ensued which caused another suspension from FIBA. As a result, the Philippines was not able to participate in the 2005 FIBA Asia Championship and the 2006 Asian Games.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the leadership struggle that saw the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas (SBP), an organization backed by the PBA among others, being recognized by both FIBA and the Philippine Olympic Committee, the Philippines was reinstated by FIBA. San Miguel-Team Pilipinas was hastily assembled for the 2007 FIBA Asia Championship in Tokushima. The team defeated China, which didn't send its best team since they already qualified for the 2008 Olympics, but lost to Iran and Jordan to bow out of contention. The Filipinos and Chinese met again for the ninth place game in which the Filipinos won by two points. The Philippines qualified for the 2009 FIBA Asia Championship in Tianjin. The Philippines advanced to the quarterfinals to meet Jordan. The Jordanians raced to any early lead where the Filipinos never recovered to win the game. The Filipinos and the Koreans played for seventh place, which saw the Koreans winning by two points.\n\nFollowing the Northern Cement model of the 1980, the SBP established the Smart Gilas Pilipinas program, backed by SBP President Manuel V. Pangilinan, as a developmental team that aims to qualify in the 2012 Olympics. In the 2010 Asian Games, the Filipinos met the Korean team anew in the quarterfinals and was eliminated. In the 2011 championship at Wuhan, the SBP successfully petitioned the naturalization of Marcus Douthit; the team progressed up to the semifinals for the first time since 1987. Meeting Jordan, the team lost, never recovering after a third quarter run by the Jordanians. In the bronze medal game against Korea with a berth to an Olympic qualifying tournament at stake, the team raced to an early lead, but the Koreans cut the lead and eventually won the game after the Filipinos missed free-throws at the end game. Despite missing an Olympic berth, Smart Gilas' performance was the best finish in the championship since 1987, and the best finish in any major Asian competition since 2002.\n\nAfter failing to qualify for the Olympics, the SBP decided to form the next edition of Smart Gilas Pilipinas team (Smart Gilas Pilipinas 2.0) composed of PBA players. The Smart Gilas Pilipinas program was renamed Gilas Pilipinas in 2013, still sponsored by Smart Communications. The national team played in the 2013 FIBA Asia Championship which was hosted at home. After losing to Chinese Taipei in the last game of the preliminary round to finish second, the team won four consecutive games to set up a semifinal against the Koreans. In a close game, the Philippines pulled away late in the game to win 86–79. The win sent the team to the finals and guaranteed qualification to the FIBA Basketball World Cup (new name of the FIBA World Championship) for the first time since 1978. The Philippines, appearing in the first FIBA Asia Championship final since the introduction of a championship game in 1987, lost by 14 points against undefeated Iran in the final to settle for a silver medal.\nThe Congress of the Philippines naturalized Andray Blatche in time for the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup to beefed-up its center position. With Blatche in tow, the Philippines nearly won four tightly fought games against higher ranked teams of Croatia, Greece, Argentina and Puerto Rico, before winning in overtime against Senegal to record its first victory at the World Cup in 40 years. In the 2014 Asian Games, Blatche was not able to join the squad due to residency requirements by the Olympic Council of Asia and Douthit suit up as the national team's naturalized player instead. The Philippines finished seventh, its worst finish in the Asian Games.\n\nOn October 30, 2014, the SBP announced the formation of two selection committees to search and appoint the coach and players of future Philippine teams – for elite level and for youth level tournaments. Chot Reyes remained coach until a replacement was decided. The new roster aims to compete in the 2015 FIBA Asia Championship in China which will serve as the Asian qualifiers of the 2016 Summer Olympics Basketball tournament in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nOn December 23, 2014, Tab Baldwin was formally announced as the new coach of the Philippine national team. Baldwin's four-year tenure as coach officially began on January 1, 2015. The team captured the silver medal in the 2015 William Jones Cup but fell short of the gold medal in the 2015 FIBA Asia Championship. However, the Philippines qualified for the 2016 FIBA World Olympic Qualifying Tournament but the team failed in their bid to Rio Olympics losing to France and New Zealand.\n\nThe team won gold during 2016 SEABA Cup and a qualifying slot in the 2016 FIBA Asia Challenge. However, as they were represented by the Gilas Cadets with no professional or naturalize players, the team suffered its worst performance placing 9th over-all, a very huge setback due to conflicting schedule with the national league and mismanagement of the SBP. In October 2016, Chot Reyes returned as head coach. In 2017, the Philippines hosted the 2017 SEABA Championship and the team swept the competition for the gold medal and the lone spot in the sub-zone for the 2017 FIBA Asia Cup. During the 2017 FIBA Asia Cup, the national team would sweep the group stage consisting of teams from China, Iraq and Qatar. The team failed to advance in the quarterfinals however and finished the tournament in seventh place. The Philippines defended their gold medal for the 12th straight time in the 2017 South East Asian Games beating Indonesia in the finals.\n\nFIBA introduced a qualification process which does not involve the continental tournaments for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup. The Philippines' qualification bid was marred by a brawl during the team's July 2018 tie against Australia in the first round of the Asian qualifiers. The incident caused suspensions for some of the players and coaches as well as a fine for SBP. Chot Reyes, who served suspension due to his involvement in the brawl was also replaced by Yeng Guiao. That game and incident started a slump in the standings that almost eliminated the Philippines from the World Cup, but under Guiao they managed to qualify in the last matchday by beating Kazakhstan, combined with a Lebanon loss to South Korea. The 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup saw the Philippines with a 0-5 record, the country's worst performance since the 1978 edition, losing four of its five games in a blowout. This was due to lack of preparations and key players begging off from the team, as well as injuries. Due to the disappointing results, the SBP sent an all-professional team for the 2019 South East Asia Games to re-establish its dominance. The national team swept the competition for their 18th Gold Medal in the tournament.\n\nThe country will co-host the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup with Japan and Indonesia.\n\nIn 1963, FIBA suspended the Philippines for its failure to stage the 1963 FIBA World Championship after Philippine president Diosdado Macapagal refused to allow players from Yugoslavia and other communist countries to enter the country. Later, the Philippines, despite being the Asian champion, was forced to play in a pre-Olympic tournament in order to qualify for the 1964 Summer Olympics.\n\nThe leadership crisis in the Basketball Association of the Philippines (BAP) worsened after a lengthy feud between the group of Graham Lim and Tiny Literal and the group of Freddie Jalasco and Lito Puyat which resulted in the suspension of the BAP. After a few months, FIBA intervened and ordered an election which resulted in Literal's victory as the president of the BAP. The suspension was quickly lifted and the Philippines was able to compete in the Southeast Asian Games in Malaysia.\n\nThe Philippines was again suspended on July 2005 after a long-standing feud between the BAP and the Philippine Olympic Committee (POC).\n\nThe conflict began on April 10, 2005, when the BAP-sponsored Cebuana-Lhuillier Philippine National team (composed of little-known amateur players) lost to a lowly Parañaque Jets team (made up of showbiz personalities) in a National Basketball Conference (NBC) pre-season tournament at the Rizal Memorial Coliseum. Upon hearing the news, POC president Jose Cojuangco, Jr. called for improvements in the national team, most notably, in the sending of a new team made up of players from the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA).\n\nThe PBA, together with the Philippine Basketball League (PBL), the UAAP and the NCAA, reportedly came to an agreement on the formation of a new national team. The POC, through a vote, first suspended, then in a later meeting, expelled the BAP as the official National Sports Association (NSA) for basketball and installed a new member in the Philippine Basketball Federation. The BAP, under new president Joey Lina, said that the expulsion was unconstitutional in the by-laws of the POC.\n\nIn hopes of securing a long-term solution, the FIBA ordered the PBA, PBL, UAAP, NCAA and Joey Lina (as an individual – or in Lina's claim, as a representative of the BAP) to form a new constitution or form of a new basketball body. By March 2006, the four stakeholders (PBA, PBL, UAAP and NCAA) signed an agreement to propose a new basketball body (Pilipinas Basketball). Lina refused to sign the memorandum, citing \"unbalanced factors\" that was put in the draft. After the four stakeholders met with Baumann in South Korea, the suspension was not lifted and the draft for a new body was not accepted since Lina was not in agreement. After several meetings between Baumann and the officials of the BAP and Pilipinas Basketball in Geneva and Bangkok, a Unity Congress was held. The BAP and Pilipinas Basketball agreed to merge, creating the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas (SBP) as the new national basketball federation. The POC recognized the SBP as the new national governing body for basketball, after which the FIBA finally lifted the almost two-year-old suspension it imposed upon the country.\n\nThe first Philippine team that competed in the 1936 Olympic Games were known as \"the Islanders\". After the Philippines became a republic in 1946, the national team was simply referred to by the press as the \"RP 5\" or \"RP team\" (\"RP\" standing for \"Republic of the Philippines\").\n\nWhen the Northern Cement basketball team represented the Philippines from 1983 to 1985, the team was referred to as the \"NCC\" team. After the disbandment of the NCC team in 1986, the national team referred to as \"RP 5\" or \"RP team\" once again.\n\nIn the 1990 Asian Games, following the example of the first U.S. Dream Team, the Philippine team was referred to the \"Philippines Dream Team\", as this was the first national team with PBA players. Later, it was referred to as \"Team Philippines\". Eventually, \"Team Philippines\" became the name used to refer to the entire Philippine contingent in multi-sports events such as the Asian and Olympic Games.\n\nDuring the Philippine Centennial in 1998, the team was officially known as the Philippine Centennial Team.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2009, Team Pilipinas represented the men's basketball team – the team was initiative of the PBA and sponsored by San Miguel Corporation (2005–2007, named \"San Miguel-Team Pilipinas\") and Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc. (2009, named \"Powerade-Team Pilipinas\").\n\nIn 2010, the Smart Gilas Pilipinas and Sinag Pilipinas programs replaced the Team Pilipinas program. Sinag Pilipinas represents the country in regional competitions such as the Southeast Asian Games and SEABA Championship. Smart Communications is the main sponsor of both programs. Gilas is a Filipino word that loosely translates into English as \"prowess\", and sinag translates as \"ray\" (sunlight). The name Gilas was adopted from the mascot of the 2005 Southeast Asian Games held in Manila, Philippines which is an eagle. The mascot was designed by Filipino sports journalist Danny Simon.\n\nIn 2013, the Smart brand was dropped from the branding of both programs, although Smart Communications remained as the main sponsor. In 2015, the Sinag Pilipinas program was renamed into as the \"Gilas Cadets\".\n\nIn Dec. 2016, The Gilas Pilipinas program got a big boost as a new backer in Chooks-to-Go to form partnership with Smart Communications in the united effort in supporting the Pinoy cagers in their quest for international glory. The team carry that name when participated in 2017 international games.\n\nThe squad that participated in the 2018 Asian Games in particular prefers to call themselves as Rain or Shine-Philippines (RoS-Philippines), Gilastopainters or simply Team Pilipinas due to the core of the team being composed of Rain or Shine Elasto Painters players instead of the Gilas nickname. The squad was standing in for the Chot Reyes-led roster which had many of its players as well as Reyes himself suspended due to their involvement in the Philippines-Australia brawl.\n\nGilas Pilipinas continued to be used to refer to the men's national team. In May 2019, the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas formally adopted the Gilas Pilipinas name for the country's women's, youth, and 3x3 national teams as well as part of a larger rebrand and restructuring.\n\nThe national colors of blue, white and red have been used in national team uniforms throughout history. Most teams used a blue uniform as the dark-colored uniform, and a white uniform for light-colored uniform. Red was occasionally used as a tertiary color. In the 2002 Asian Games, the dark-colored uniform was a red one. The SBP has consistently used the blue and white uniform as dark and light uniforms, respectively. Nike has been the official outfitter of the national team ever since the SBP took over. In the 2013 Asian Championship, the color white has been used to identify the team with the fans.\n\nIt usually uses a distinct coat of arms, as seen above, distinct from the SBP (or BAP) logo, or the official coat of arms.\n\n\nOpposition: Indonesia (February 23)<br>\nVenue: The BritAma Arena, Jakarta\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1919911", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1919911", "title": "Battle of Baia", "text": "Battle of Baia\n\nThe Battle of Baia (, ) was fought on December 15, 1467, between the Moldavian prince, Stephen the Great and Hungarian king, Matthias Corvinus. The battle was the last Hungarian attempt to subdue the independent Moldavia, as previous attempts had ended in failure. Corvinus invaded Moldavia as a consequence of Stephen's annexation of Chilia—a fortress and harbour at the coast of the Black Sea, which at the time was controlled by Hungarian and Wallachian forces, though it had belonged to Moldavia centuries earlier.\n\nThe conflict ended with a draw, with the annual retreat of both sides. This put an end to all Hungarian claims on Moldavia. \nIn 1359, Bogdan I of Moldavia rebelled against the King of Hungary and founded an independent Moldavia. However, the Hungarian attempts to seize control over Moldavia did not end there, and in 1429, Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, and also King of Hungary, met with Władysław Jagiełło, King of Poland to try to persuade him to launch a common attack on Moldavia and divide the country in two equal parts—Polish and Hungarian. Sigismund argued that the Moldavian nation did not \"owe allegiance to anyone, is accustomed to live by theft and brigandage and so is everyone's enemy.\" He also complained about not receiving any help for his struggle against the Turks. In the Annals of Jan Długosz, the Polish chronicler wrote the following on Władysław’s reply to Sigismund:\n\nAfter the death of Alexander I, he country was thrown into civil strife, in which the two claimants, Peter Aron III and Bogdan II, in order to gain the throne, pledged loyalty to either the Hungarian or the Polish king. The political turmoil lasted until 1457, when Stephen, son of Bogdan, having fled to Hungary and later Wallachia, with Wallachian help, gained the throne and ousted the boyars loyal to Aron. The latter fled to Poland, but was later forced to seek asylum in Hungary, after Moldavia and Poland concluded a new treaty. Stephen’s objective was to regain the region of Budjak with the castles of Chilia and Cetatea Albă. The region had previously belonged to Wallachia, but had been incorporated into Moldavia in the late 14th century. Due to the decline of Moldavia during the civil war, the region reverted to Wallachia, with Chilia being co-ruled by Hungary and Wallachia.\nIn 1462, Stephen sent a letter to his cousin, Prince Vlad III Dracula of Wallachia, asking him to return Chilia back to Moldavia—a demand that was most likely refused. On 22 June, when Vlad was fighting Sultan Mehmed II of the Ottoman Empire, Stephen launched an attack on Chilia, with some Turkish assistance, with the objective of capturing the fortress. The Wallachians rushed to the scene with 7,000 men, and together with the Hungarian garrison, battled the Moldavians and the Turks for eight days. The Turks were defeated and Stephen was wounded by a piece of shrapnel — an injury which would hasten his death. In 1465, when Vlad was in Hungary, Stephen again advanced towards Chilia with a large force and siege weapons; but instead of besieging the fortress, he showed the garrison, who favoured the Polish King, a letter in which the King requires them to surrender the fortress. The garrison complied with the King's demand and Stephen entered the fortress escorted by Polish troops where he found “its two captains, rather tipsy, for they have been to a wedding.” Mehmed was furious about the news and claimed Chilia as being a part of Wallachia, which now was a vassal to the Porte, and demanded Stephen relinquish ownership. However, Stephen refused and recruited an army, forcing Mehmed, who was not yet ready to wage war, to accept the situation, if only for the time being. Długosz recalls that in the beginning of his reign, Stephen reformed his army by extending rights for men to bear arms:\n\nIn 1466, Stephen regained Khotyn from Poland in a diplomatic victory, but in the same year, Corvinus became on bad terms with King Casimir IV Jagiellon of Poland, which frustrated the Hungarian king further, knowing that Moldavia was a Polish fief. One year later, in 1467, the locals of Transylvania started an uprising in which Corvinus had a difficult time quelling the riots. He later found out that Stephen had supported the rioters, — probably in order to find and kill Aron. Długosz writes in his ‘’Annals’’ that in 1467, a certain \"Berendeja\" went to the court of Corvinus and promised to make Moldavia his vassal, if the King would in turn make him Prince of Moldavia. This was denounced by Romanian historian Nicolae Iorga, who argued that Corvinus started recruiting troops and took Aron with him to put him on the Moldavian throne. This is disputed by Długosz though, who in ‘’Historiae Polonicae’’, adds that Corvinus brought with him both Aron and Berendeja, making unknown whom the king considered more worthy of the Moldavian throne.\n\nThe Hungarians recruited an army of 40,000, many drawn locally from Transylvania. Many knights and Hungarian aristocrats followed, one of them being Stefan Báthory. With them, they brought 500 cannons and other heavy siege equipment. The Moldavians, being fewer in number and seeing that the Hungarians were determined to wage war, started to evacuate the population close to the Hungarian border and blockaded the passages by cutting down trees and placing them on the roads.\n\nThe Hungarians departed in the middle of October and reached the realm of Moldavia at the beginning of November, using a passage near Bacău. On 19 November, the Hungarians arrived at the Trotuș River where they met some Moldavian resistance, but Corvinus, to ensure the \"loyalty of his troops, avoids a pitched battle and limits his efforts to surprise attacks and ambushes, yet is himself prevented from foraging or doing further damage.\"\n\nThe town was destroyed and the Hungarians headed for Bacău, which they also burned down; then they continued to Roman and stayed there between 29 November and 7 December. According to a chronicle, Stephen sent envoys to negotiate a peace treaty, but the two factions could not agree and the war continued. Roman was put to flames and the Hungarians killed everyone they encountered, “without considering their sex, age, or looks.” After three days of marching and more pillaging, they reached Baia where Corvinus met with a Hungarian nobleman by the name of Sythotus, who revealed to him the Moldavian position, their numbers (12,000), and their plan to attack before dusk. The Moldavians were encamped further north, between Moldova River and Șomuz creek. Corvinus ordered the city to be fortified with \"ramparts, ditches and a ring of wagons\", as the men were told to be prepared for battle and guards were sent to guard strategic points.\n\nA peculiar report mentions that Stephen himself was captured by the Hungarians on 14 December, but that he convinced them to release him. On 15 December, when dusk was approaching, Stephen sent smaller detachments that set the town on fire from three different places: thereafter, noise and confusion set in. Stephen ordered his men to dismount and soon after they launched their attack and made battle until dawn. Descriptions of the battle say that the fire made the night equally light as the day and that many Hungarians were consumed by the flames. The two armies started to butcher each other at the gate of the city; then the fighting continued onto the streets \"with such a wrath, that nothing could be seen as more horrible than this.\" The Moldavians got the upper hand of the battle and launched another attack against the royal guard, which consisted of 200 heavily armed knights, the aristocrats, and Corvinus. Many Moldavians were killed in the tumult that followed, as Báthory and the rest of the knights defended the entrance to the market. Corvinus was wounded and, allegedly he had to be “carried from the battlefield on a stretcher, to avoid him falling into the hands of the enemy.” For Moldavians, it was a victory because they could retreat, leaving only 14 of their battleflags in the hands of the Hungarian army, and Stephen was able to write a letter to the Polish king, stating that he won the battle. The captured battleflags were suspended in the Boldogasszony church of Budapest, as sign of victory over the vassal, the Hungarian bishop and pot dedicating three epigrammas to them.\n\nAccording to Długosz, Corvinus escaped the Moldavians due to the assistance of another Vlach (Romanian), whom Stephen found and had executed because of treachery. The \"Moldavian-German Chronicles\" say that someone named Isaia failed to launch the cavalry attack which would have blocked the path for the Hungarian retreat; for this, he and others were later executed. 4,000-10,000 Hungarians were said to have been killed; most of the barons survived, following their king. Janus Pannonius mentions totally 11,000 casualties for the Moldavian, with 4,000 \"cut down while retreating\".\n\nSome of the Hungarian standards that were captured came with a \"huge booty of tents, waggons and guns\", which were sent to Casimir as proof of Stephen's victory. Upon his return to Brassó on Christmas day, Corvinus took revenge on the people who had rebelled against him; thereafter he collected a war tax of 400,000 florins, which they had to pay immediately, in gold. With this money he raised an army of foreign mercenaries, which would prove more loyal to him. \nCorvinus rewarded in 1469 some Romanians from Maramureș who were on Corvinus's side, for their bravery when saving the life of the king: Coroi from Oncești (Maramureș), his son Ioan, and their brothers in arms: Mihai de Petrova, Mihai Nan de Slatina, Petru Leucă from Valea Lupului, Ioan Miclea from Șugatag, Petru de Berbești, Simion son of Pop de Uglea, Lupșa de Berbești, Steț de Biserica Albă and George Avram de Oncești\n\nIn 1468, Stephen campaigned in Transylvania, found Aron and had him executed. Stephen and Corvinus would later negotiate a peace treaty, with Stephen accepting Corvinus as his de jure liege lord. In 1475, Corvinus sent 6,800 soldiers that assisted Stephen in his victory at the Battle of Vaslui.\n\n"}

AVO analysis is a technique that geophysicists can execute on seismic data to determine a rock's fluid content, porosity, density or seismic velocity, shear wave information, fluid indicators (hydrocarbon indications).\n\nThe phenomenon is based on the relationship between the reflection coefficient and the angle of incidence and has been understood since the early 20th century when Karl Zoeppritz wrote down the Zoeppritz equations. Due to its physical origin, AVO can also be known as amplitude versus angle (AVA), but AVO is the more commonly used term because the offset is what a geophysicist can vary in order to change the angle of incidence. (See diagram)\n\nFor a seismic wave reflecting off an interface between two media at normal incidence, the expression for the reflection coefficient is relatively simple:\nwhere formula_2 and formula_3 are the acoustic impedances of the first and second medium, respectively.\nThe situation becomes much more complicated in the case of non-normal incidence, due to mode conversion between P-waves and S-waves, and is described by the Zoeppritz equations.\n\nIn 1919, Karl Bernhard Zoeppritz derived four equations that determine the amplitudes of reflected and refracted waves at a planar interface for an incident P-wave as a function of the angle of incidence and six independent elastic parameters. These equations have 4 unknowns and can be solved but they do not give an intuitive understanding for how the reflection amplitudes vary with the rock properties involved.\n\nP. Richards and C. Frasier expanded the terms for the reflection and transmission coefficients for a P-wave incident upon a solid-solid interface and simplified the result by assuming only small changes in elastic properties across the interface. Therefore, the squares and differential products are small enough to tend to zero and be removed. This form of the equations allows one to see the effects of density and P- or S- wave velocity variations on the reflection amplitudes. This approximation was popularized in the 1980 book Quantitative Seismology by K. Aki and P. Richards and has since been commonly referred to as the Aki and Richards approximation.\n\nOstrander was the first to introduce a practical application of the AVO effect, showing that a gas sand underlying a shale exhibited amplitude variation with offset.\n\nShuey further modified the equations by assuming – as Ostrander had – that Poisson's ratio was the elastic property most directly related to the angular dependence of the reflection coefficient. This gives the 3-term Shuey Equation:\nwhere\nand\n\nwhere formula_8=angle of incidence; formula_9 = P-wave velocity in medium; <math>\n\n"}

Founded in 2002 as a splinter party of the centre-right Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), HIP never won any seats in elections, although it briefly had three MPs in the Croatian Parliament in late 2003. Following poor results in the November 2003 parliamentary election, the party fell into obscurity before being formally dissolved in August 2011.\n\nHIP grew out of a conservative citizens' association known by the same initialism, called \"Croatian Identity and Prosperity\" (), established by conservative politician Miroslav Tuđman, son of the late Franjo Tuđman. It was formally registered as a party in January 2002, at the time when the main conservative party Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) was going through a period of considerable internal turmoil brought about by their defeat in the 2000 general election.\n\nHIP sought to rally right-wing politicians and voters who had been disappointed with the party's change in position from right-wing to centre-right under the guidance of the newly elected party chief Ivo Sanader. HIP thus advocated a return to conservative nationalism which had been espoused by HDZ and its longtime president Franjo Tuđman in the 1990s. It adamantly opposed Croatian government's cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and extradition of Croatian army generals who had been charged with war crimes related to the 1991–95 Croatian War of Independence.\n\nThe party held their first general convention on 30 November 2002 in Zagreb. In August 2003 two HDZ members of Sabor, Ante Beljo and Dario Vukić, joined HIP, which made it a parliamentary party. In September 2003 Đuro Njavro, a former member of HDZ, also joined the party, which gave HIP a total of three MPs by the time the 4th Sabor assembly was dissolved in October 2003.\n\nSome seven months before the party was formally registered members of the preceding citizens' association ran in the May 2001 local elections on a formally independent list. They created a minor upset by winning five seats in the 51-seat City of Zagreb municipal assembly, held by some of HIP's most prominent members including Miroslav Tuđman, former HDZ health minister Andrija Hebrang and navy admiral Davor Domazet-Lošo. \nIn the following May 2005 local elections HIP ran on a coalition list with three other minor parties but failed to win any seats, getting 1.16 percent of the vote.\n\nFor the November 2003 general election HIP formed a right-wing coalition with Croatian Bloc (HB), another hardline nationalist HDZ splinter party led by former senior HDZ member Ivić Pašalić. However, the HB-HIP coalition fared poorly and failed to cross the five percent election threshold in any of the 10 geographical districts. They recorded their best result in District XI - the constituency for Croatian citizens living abroad - where they finished second behind HDZ with 9.73 percent of the vote. However, since the number of parliament seats from District XI is calculated in proportion to the total number of votes cast, they failed to win a seat in the 5th Sabor.\n\nFollowing the 2003 election both HIP and HB fell into obscurity. HIP continued to exist but did not run in any elections since and HB leader Ivić Pašalić retired from politics. Miroslav Tuđman ran in the 2009–10 presidential election as an independent candidate and finished seventh in the first round with 4.09 percent of the vote. HIP was officially struck from the party registry in August 2011.\n"}
{"id": "1919978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1919978", "title": "River Perry, Shropshire", "text": "River Perry, Shropshire\n\nThe River Perry is a river in Shropshire, England. It rises near Oswestry and flows south to meet the River Severn above Shrewsbury. Along its length, its level drops by some 320 feet (95 m). The channel has been heavily engineered, both to enable water mills to be powered by it, and to improve the drainage of the surrounding land. There were at least seven corn mills in the 1880s, and the last one remained operational until 1966. The middle section of the river crosses Baggy Moor, where major improvements were made in 1777 to drain the moor. The scheme was one of the largest to enclose and improve land in North Shropshire, and the quality of the reclaimed land justified the high cost. A section of the river bed was lowered in the 1980s, to continue the process.\n\nThe river is crossed by the Llangollen Canal, and by several bridges which are on the Listed Buildings register. It has formerly suffered from pollution, both from the discharge of poorly treated sewage from two treatment works, and from effluent from factories producing dairy products. These are now well-regulated, but the river was the scene of a major pollution incident in 1985, when pig slurry discharged into it, killing around 100,000 fish.\n\nThe river rises as a series of springs near Hengoed, to the west of Gobowen and to the north of Oswestry, close to the contour. It passes under the Shrewsbury to Ruabon railway line and the A5 road, to skirt around the northern edge of Gobowen. It is joined by several other streams, which also rise at springs to the west of Gobowen, some from as high as above sea level, and another which rises near New Marton, and flows south, passing under the Llangollen Canal.\n\nPassing under the A495 road to the north of Whittington, it enters the parkland of Halston Hall, supplying a large ornamental lake. The hall is a red-brick country house, originally built in the 1690s, but altered for its owner John Mytton by Robert Mylne between 1766 and 1768. It is a grade I listed structure. The river briefly heads south to leave the park, and then turns to the east, where it is crossed by the Montgomery Canal. At this point it is below the contour. The Perry aqueduct, which carries the canal over the river, was the scene of a major breach in 1936, which led to the canal closing. It was not reopened until 1987.\n\nNext it turns to the south, passing through Baggy Moor, where it is joined by a large number of drainage ditches. The railway line crosses it again, before it reaches Ruyton-XI-Towns, where there is a large loop around higher ground to the east. The river is crossed by Platt Mill Bridge, designed and built in 1791 by Edward Cureton. The river forms the border between civil parishes at this point, and so one half of the bridge is in Ruyton-XI-Towns, while the other is in Baschurch. The bridge has two arches, and is a grade II listed structure. A circular toll-house, built of red sandstone with a conical slate roof, was erected in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth century close to the bridge, and is now used as a house. Continuing to the south-west of Baschurch, Milford Bridge is another two-arched structure, which carries the Baschurch to Little Ness road over the river. It was designed by Thomas Stanton in 1831, and was built by Nathaniel Edwards. Stanton was the civil engineer Thomas Telford's deputy at the time, when Telford was the County Surveyor of Bridges for Shropshire. The river passes along the south-western edge of Yeaton Peverey parkland, to reach Forton Heath, where there is a bridge with a single elliptical arch, built in the early nineteenth century, which carries the Mytton to Forton road. Below the bridge, the river joins the River Severn, close to the contour. The junction is not far from Shrewsbury, but the course of the Severn is much longer, as it flows around several large meanders to reach the town.\n\nThe river rises on the edge of the North Shropshire sandstone plain, but for most of its length, the underlying rock is Bunter Sandstone. A series of streams converge to the east of Gobowen, which have risen further to the west at heights of up to . Initially, the streams are stony-bottomed, but this is soon replaced by clays and alluvial silts. Near Rednal, the flow is augmented by the Tetchill Brook, which starts as an outflow from a large mere at Ellesmere. The outflow was a Victorian solution to control the levels of the mere. It is joined by Newnes Brook, which drains sandstone-based soils between Ellesmere and Gobowen. Below the junction the river crosses Baggy Moor, a large basin which was filled with peat, but which has been extensively drained to enable it to be used for agriculture. Prior to 1777, it was flooded every winter, but an Act of Parliament was then obtained, to authorise the improvement and enclosure of of land. This was one of the largest areas enclosed in north Shropshire, and although the scheme was more costly and difficult than enclosing some of the dryer areas, the resultant land was more fertile, and so justified the cost.\n\nBelow the large meander at Ruyton, where a narrow valley cuts through sandstone, the bed flows over boulder clay with some glacial debris, and becomes stony again. The lower section retains some of its natural features, including meanders and riffle-pool sequences, which provide habitat for fish. Much of the upper section has been heavily modified, with the river canalised to improve flow. Between 1985 and 1988, the river bed between Ruyton and Rednal was lowered by about , in order to improve the drainage of Baggy Moor.\n\nWater quality is affected by discharges from Sewage Treatment Plants, including one which reaches the river from Oswestry via the Common Brook, and another which discharged into the Tetchill Brook at Ellesmere prior to 1999. The sewage works has since been closed, and improvements have been made to sewage outfalls and storm drains. In addition the brook has been dredged to remove polluted silts, and field studies have subsequently revealed that the quality of the brook is improving, measured by the diversity of invertebrates found in it. In addition, water quality is affected by effluent from factories processing dairy products. These and the sewage works outfalls are generally well-regulated, but there have been some serious pollution incidents as a result of poor agricultural practice. The worst was in September 1985, when of pig slurry was discharged into the river, resulting in the destruction of all of the fish populations down to the River Severn. A tank containing the slurry burst, and around 100,000 fish died as a result of the pollution.\n\nFlow on the river is measured at three gauging stations. The furthest upstream is at Perry Farm, which uses a flat V triangular profile weir. That at Ruyton Bridge is a velocity area gauging station, while the final one is at Yeaton, where there is a Crump Profile weir. The catchment area above the Yeaton station is , which receives a mean rainfall of . This results in a mean flow of 30.4 million gallons per day (138.2 Mld), although a peak flow of 336 million gallons per day (1528 Mld) was recorded in February 1990.\n\nThe Environment Agency measure water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish, and chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations. Chemical status is rated good or fail.\n\nThe water quality of the Perry and its tributaries was as follows in 2015.\nThe water quality of the Common Brook has improved from bad in 2009 to poor in 2015. Over the same period, the middle section of the Perry has improved from poor to moderate, while the War Brook has regressed from good to poor.\n\nThe river has been modified significantly to power water mills over the centuries. The furthest upstream was probably at Rednal Mill, which is thought to be the site of a water mill, but showed no signs of a water management system in 1875, although there appears to be a bypass channel to the north, and the administrative boundaries do not follow the main channel at this point. Between Ruyton and the River Severn, there were seven further corn mills, all of which are clearly marked on maps from 1880 to 1882.\n\nNew Mills was just below Platt Bridge, while Milford Mill was just above Milford Bridge. Adcote Mill was by Adcote Farm, and most of the channels can still be seen. There were two mills at Yeaton, the Upper Mill and the Lower Mill, either side of Yeaton Bridge, and the final two were Fitz Mill and Mytton Mill. Fitz Mill was operational between the twelfth century and 1926, and the structure is now used by a haulage company. Mytton Mill was operational until 1966, when production ceased.

He is best known for his time at Nottingham Forest, during which he won the 1979 and 1980 European Cup Finals. He was also capped three times by England.\n\nBirtles was signed by Nottingham Forest from non-league Long Eaton United for £2,000. He made his Forest debut as a winger in March 1977 in the old Second Division against Hull City. His second competitive first team appearance was not until 18 months later in September 1978. Peter Withe had been sold to Newcastle and Steve Elliott failed to make the grade. This allowed Birtles a chance that he grasped. He scored his first goal for the club in his third match, a first round 1978–79 European Cup tie against holders Liverpool. Birtles kept his place for the rest of the season capping his success with two goals in the 3–2 win over Southampton in the 1979 League Cup Final. He also won a 1979 European Cup winner's medal via the 1–0 victory over Malmö FF of Sweden in Munich's Olympic Stadium. He scored 14 times in the league alone that season.\n\nHe gained another winner's medal in the following season's European Cup against Hamburg providing the return pass from which John Robertson scored the only goal. Birtles also played in every First Division game for Forest that season scoring 12 goals.\n\nHe began the 1980–81 season in fine form, scoring six goals in nine league games for Forest, before a £1.25 million fee took him to Manchester United.\n\nUnder manager Dave Sexton, Birtles made his debut for Manchester United in a First Division victory over Stoke City at the Victoria Ground on 22 October 1980. He made 28 appearances in his first season with the club.\n\nHe scored his first league goal for United in the 1981–82 season, and went on to score 11 times for them that season.\n\nCoincidentally, his Manchester United spell ended where it began – against Stoke City. His final appearance for them came on the last day of the season, when they beat the Potters 2–0 at Old Trafford. He began the 1982–83 season still with Manchester United, but was not selected for a first team game, and returned to play for Nottingham Forest.\n\nHis second spell at Forest included a spell at centre-half. However, he still proved himself to be a competent goalscorer, particularly with 15 league goals in the 1983–84 season and 14 in the 1986–87 season, the last of which he was joint top goalscorer alongside midfield star Neil Webb and up-and-coming striker Nigel Clough. However, Forest manager Brian Clough allowed Birtles to part from the club on a free transfer in June 1987.\n\nHe spent 18 months with Notts County, during which he appeared in almost every league game. Birtles ended his career with Grimsby Town. They won two successive promotions during his time there, and by the end of his career he had accumulated more than 400 professional league appearances.\nDuring the final months of his first spell at Nottingham Forest, when he was still reputed as one of the English league's finest strikers, he was capped three times at senior level for England. His first cap came on 13 May 1980 in a 3–1 friendly win over Argentina. His last came on 15 October that year in a 2–1 defeat against Romania in a 1982 World Cup qualifier.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He played as a forward before being forced to retire due to a recurring back injury. He moved into media presentation, initially on television, before moving over to radio where he has for many years now been a presenter on Talksport.\n\nBorn in 1959 in the Govan district of Glasgow, Brazil started his career in England with Ipswich Town in 1977, where he stayed until 1983, appearing a total of 210 times and scoring 80 goals. In 1978, he was loaned to the Detroit Express in the North American Soccer League, appearing in 21 regular season games and 3 playoff games, scoring 10 goals in total. He made his Ipswich debut in a league match against Manchester United on 14 January 1978, and also contributed to their victorious 1977–78 FA Cup run when he played against Bristol Rovers in the fifth round replay. However he wasn't part of the squad for the final itself. Brazil was a key player by the 1980–81 season, when they won the UEFA Cup and finished runners-up in the league. Ipswich finished runners-up once more the following season, when Brazil scored 22 goals, making him the second-highest scorer in the First Division after Kevin Keegan, who scored 26 for Southampton. One of his finest games in an Ipswich shirt came on 16 February 1982, when he scored all of their goals in a 5–2 league win over Southampton.\n\nBrazil moved to Tottenham Hotspur in March 1983 for £425,000, scoring six times in 10 appearances. In his only full season at White Hart Lane he scored three goals in 19 games, while his fellow Scot Steve Archibald scored 21 times. Tottenham won the 1983–84 UEFA Cup and Brazil scored four goals during their cup run, however he wasn't part of the squad for the final. In June 1984 Brazil joined Manchester United for a fee of £625,000. He stayed with United for two seasons, but a recurring back injury restricted him to a total of 41 appearances in the League, the League Cup, the FA Cup and the UEFA Cup. Competition for places at Old Trafford was very fierce, with Irish International Frank Stapleton, Mark Hughes and Peter Davenport all in contention. Brazil scored 16 goals during his 18 months with Manchester United, but by the time his second season got underway, he was no longer a regular member of the first team, with most his final appearances for the club coming as a substitute.\n\nIn January 1986, he was transferred to Coventry City as a 'makeweight' in the deal that took Terry Gibson to Old Trafford. He made 15 league appearances, scoring twice, and was given a free transfer at the end of the season, with his back problems becoming more evident. Joining Queens Park Rangers, he made a total of four appearances, scoring once (the winner against Blackburn in the FA Cup), and went on to play for Bury Town, Chelmsford City and Stambridge United. Brazil left British football in 1988 to join Wollongong City (now the South Coast Wolves), a New South Wales-based club in Australia's National Soccer League. He returned to Europe to spend his final season (1988–89) with FC Baden of the Swiss Challenge League, the country's second division, before his playing career ended due to the serious back injury that had plagued him for seasons.\n\nBrazil made 13 appearances for Scotland, the most notable of which saw him playing in the 1982 FIFA World Cup finals in Spain. He was the youngest member of the Scotland squad at the finals. His debut came against Poland in a friendly in Warsaw on 28 May 1980, which Scotland lost 1–0. His last full international came on 1 June 1983 in a 2–0 Home Championship defeat to England. He scored once for the Scottish national side, in his penultimate appearance on 28 May 1983 in a 2–0 Home Championship win over Wales.\n\nHis international appearances were limited as Scotland had a number of other strikers at this time such as Kenny Dalglish, Charlie Nicholas, Mo Johnston, Steve Archibald, Paul Sturrock, Joe Jordan, Frank McAvennie, Davie Dodds, Frank McGarvey and Andy Gray who were preferred to Brazil.\n\nBrazil was a sports analyst for breakfast TV station GMTV in its early days. Soon afterwards, was invited to join Andy Gray in The Boot Room on Sky Sports. When Sky Sports gained rights to the Football League and the Football League Cup, Brazil worked as a studio analyst and may have done some work as a co-commentator.\n\nHe later worked as a co-commentator on matches covered by Anglia TV in the 200102 season.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Brazil joined radio station Talk Radio to present evening sports programming, titled \"It's Just Like Watching Brazil\". When the station became Talk Sport in early 2000, he became co-presenter on the weekday 610am programme. The show has since been renamed the 'Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast'. He has had various co-presenters over the years, including Mike Parry, Graham Beecroft and Ronnie Irani. Since Irani left the show in 2013, there has been a variety of co-presenters including Matt Holland, Ray Parlour, David Ginola, Dominic Cork, Neil Warnock and Brian Moore.\n\nBrazil missed a show in March 2004 and was dismissed by the station, but he was reinstated three weeks later.\n\nWhile reacting to the death of actor Robin Williams in August 2014, Brazil said on his talkSPORT show that he did not have a lot of sympathy for people who commit suicide as it leaves their families in a \"diabolical\" situation. Many listeners criticised Brazil for not showing any regard for Williams having suffered from depression. The station apologised for offence caused and said it did not agree with his opinion.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Brazil was subject to abuse at Celtic Boys Club, by Jim Torbett. When Torbett was charged and tried in 1996, Brazil was a witness for the prosecution. Torbett was found guilty on child abuse charges and sentenced to two years in prison.\n\nHaving retired from English league football aged 27 due to injury, for several years in the 1990s Brazil ran the Black Adder pub in Ipswich. This business venture failed and Brazil was declared bankrupt.\n\nA fan of horse racing, in 2003 he formed the Alan Brazil Racing Club based at Newmarket near to his home in Suffolk. In 2006 Brazil published a book co-written with Mike Parry called \"There's an Awful Lot of Bubbly in Brazil\". This was followed in 2007 by \"Both Barrels from Brazil: My War Against the Numpties\", again co-written with Parry.\n\nIn September 2007, Brazil was arrested near Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk on suspicion of drink-driving. He was convicted, banned from driving for 20 months, and given a £750 fine, as well as being ordered to pay £450 compensation to the court.\n\nIn 2011, Brazil brought out a range of bar nuts named 'Alan Brazil's Nuts', a play on Brazil nuts. The packages have barcodes readable by smartphones for accessing Talksport-related media. The nuts are produced at an Intersnack factory in Haverhill, Suffolk, with profits going to the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation. Robson, who died from cancer in 2009, was Brazil's manager at Ipswich. The range of salted and dry roasted peanuts were due to be extended to cashews and chilli nuts in 2012.\n\n\n\n"}

The defining characteristic of a VSP (of which there are many types) is that either the energy source, or the detectors (or sometimes both) are in a borehole. In the most common type of VSP, Hydrophones, or more often geophones or accelerometers, in the borehole record reflected seismic energy originating from a seismic source at the surface.\n\nThere are numerous methods for acquiring a vertical seismic profile (VSP). Zero-offset VSPs (A) have sources close to the wellbore directly above receivers. Offset VSPs (B) have sources some distance from the receivers in the wellbore. Walkaway VSPs (C) feature a source that is moved to progressively farther offset and receivers held in a fixed location. Walk-above VSPs (D) accommodate the recording geometry of a deviated well, having each receiver in a different lateral position and the source directly above the receiver. Salt-proximity VSPs (E) are reflection surveys to help define a salt-sediment interface near a wellbore by using a source on top of a salt dome away from the drilling rig. Drill-noise VSPs (F), also known as seismic-while-drilling (SWD) VSPs, use the noise of the drill bit as the source and receivers laid out along the ground. Multi-offset VSPs (G) involve a source some distance from numerous receivers in the wellbore.\n\n"}

Its conductors were Hans Bernhard, Mathias Breitschaft, Klaus Knubben and, since 2014, Andreas Bollendorf.\n\nThe choir's main task is singing in services at the Limburg Cathedral. The choir also performs in other services and performs concerts internationally. The repertoire is from all eras of classical music. They took part in recordings of Mahler symphonies, conducted by Eliahu Inbal and Paavo Järvi, and in the premiere of Kagel's \"Sankt-Bach-Passion\".\n\nIn their home Musisches Internat, which served as a boarding school until 2007, the boys receive thorough training, four vocal rehearsals per week, individual voice coaching, and instrumental instructions. They study not only choral but also solo parts of the works they perform. Many tours took them to European and American countries. Choir members became soloists or conductors, and formed chamber choirs. \n\nThe Limburger Domsingknaben were founded in 1967 by Wilhelm Kempf, then Bishop of Limburg. Their home is the , a boarding school in Hadamar, close to Limburg. The first conductor was the former Cathedral Kapellmeister Hans Bernhard.

From 1987, Domkantor Klaus Knubben was the chorale conductor, succeeded in 2014 by Andreas Bollendorf who had been a choir member as a boy. The voice coach is Wilhelm Gries.\n\nThe focus of the choir is to sing in services of the Limburg Cathedral, alternating with the Mädchenkantorei and the Limburger Domchor. The choir also performs in services in and outside of the Diocese of Limburg, and performs concerts internationally.

The choir performs in public yearly about 80 times, including 40 church services, secular concerts and church concerts, appearances on radio and television, and singing for special occasions.\n\nThe boys rehearse twice a week when they begin, and four times for regular members. They receive individual vocal training that makes them able to also sing solo parts. Beginning in 2007, the Musisches Internat is only used during the day, because full boarding could no longer be offered. It is used for vocal education, instrumental training (because each singer has to learn at least one instrument), and supervised homework, but also for sports and recreation.\n\nConcert tours, beginning in 1987, took the choir to U.S. (1989, 1998 and 2007), Canada (1993 and 2001), Mexico (2000), Brazil (2011), Argentina (2011), Paraguay (2011), South Africa (1995) and other, mostly European, countries. As of 2017, the choir traveled on more than 40 tours to 26 countries. \n\nThe 50th anniversary of the choir was celebrated in 2017. They were acknowledged as ambassadors of the diocese.

He studied at the Charles University in Prague (1821–1824) and attained a doctorate in medicine on 6 March 1828 at the University of Vienna. In 1830, he became assistant to Johann Wagner, the professor of pathological anatomy, and succeeded him in 1834 as prosector, being at the same time made extraordinary professor. He became a full professor ten years later.\n\nIn 1847, to his duties as a teacher, Rokitansky added the onerous office of medico-legal anatomist to the city of Vienna.\n\nIn 1863, Rokitansky was appointed by Anton von Schmerling as medical adviser to the Ministry of the Interior, wherein he advised on all routine matters of medical teaching, including patronage.\n\nAs a young professor, Rokitansky recognized that the still little noted discipline of pathological anatomy could be of great service to clinical work in the hospital, because it could offer new diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities to the bed-side physician. \n\nLudwig Freiherr Baron von Türkheim (1777-1846) established the Second Vienna Medical School in 1836. Around Rokitansky's autopsies the school began \"one of the most fruitful and brilliant epochs of Viennese medicine\". A paradigm shift occurred, led by Rokitansky, Josef Škoda, and Ferdinand von Hebra, moving from the notion of medicine as a branch of natural philosophy, to the more modern notion of it as a science.\n\nRokitansky's name is associated with the following diseases/morphologic features of disease:\n\nRokitansky also developed a method of autopsy which consisted mainly of \"in situ\" dissection. Rokitansky is said \"to have supervised 70,000 autopsies, and personally performed over 30,000, averaging two a day, seven days a week, for 45 years\".\n\nAlthough Rokitansky defended the \"materialistic method\" in scientific research, he rejected materialism as a philosophical world view. In his commemorative speech on the occasion of the opening of the Institute of Pathological Anatomy at the General Hospital of Vienna, he warned against the abuse of \"natural science liberties\". Scientists should first regard humans as \"conscious and free-willing subjects\" and only then follow their urge toward knowledge. The feeling of humanity would be lost if physicians regarded human beings purely as research objects. Thus Rokitansky brought up for the first time the question of ethics in medicine. In another speech about the \"solidarity of all animal life\", delivered at the Imperial Academy of Sciences, Rokitansky showed his proximity to Arthur Schopenhauer's writings on compassion: \"if we [... ] preserve and practice compassion\", he explained \"we are able to alleviate part of the load of suffering\" of patients. Human generosity will be shown by our capability to accept the greatest sufferings by voluntarily renouncing aggression. Those who succeed in this should be our greatest ethical role models.\n\nIn 1845, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. On 17 July 1848 Rokitansky was elected as an effective member of the Imperial Academy of Sciences. In 1866, he became its vice-president and from 1869 until his death in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, on 23 July 1878, its president. Rokitansky felt that this \"was the largest honour which I could enjoy\".\n\nBy way of his leading positions in the most diverse academic and political institutions of the Austrian Empire, Rokitansky helped to shape the era of Austrian high liberalism. He represented liberalism among the educated middle class and strove for \"freedom and progress\", both to the university reform and to the substantial improvement of health sciences. Rokitansky was several times the dean of the medical school, and, in 1853, the first freely elected rector of the medical congregation of the University of Vienna and president of the Superior Medical Council. From 1850 until his death, he also presided the Physician's Society of Vienna. On 25 November 1867 he was \"unexpectedly and unprepared\" nominated by Franz Joseph I to the upper house of the Royal Council () in recognition of his public service. Finally, he was elected in 1870 to the presidency of the Anthropological Society.\n\nTwo of Rokitansky's sons became professors at Vienna, one of astronomy and another of medicine, while a third gained distinction on the lyric stage, and another as a composer:\n\n\nHis published works include:\n\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1936, the NJCL comprises more than 1,000 Latin, Greek and Classical chapters in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, and with over 45,000 members, is the largest Classical organization in the world today. Its mission: \"to encourage an interest in and an appreciation of the language, literature and culture of ancient Greece and Rome and to impart an understanding of the debt of our own culture to that of classical antiquity.\" The current NJCL National Committee Chair is Mrs. Catherine Sturgill of Williston High School in Williston, Florida.\n\nNJCL official colors are and gold.\n\nThe idea of creating a junior organization to the American Classical League was first proposed in 1927 at the organization's annual meeting. A committee was appointed to study the matter, but it decided two years later that it wouldn't be worth pursuing at the time. In 1936, a pin was made and lifetime membership cost thirty cents, as it was decided to pursue the creation of a junior organization. The Junior Classical League was announced in November 1936 in \"Classical Outlook\", with headquarters being established at New York University.\n\nToday, chapters exist in the United States, Canada, and Australia and has over 50,000 members.\n\nThe NJCL hosts a week-long national convention annually at a college campus in late July or early August, where 1200–1500 students compete in academic tests, graphic and creative arts competitions, and meet many classics students from around the country.\n\nOther components of the convention in which students may participate include Certamen, seminars commonly known as Colloquia, and Ludi (literally \"games\"—various athletic and recreational events). Students may also campaign for public offices within the NJCL, including President, Treasurer, and Historian. Starting regularly in 1972, every convention is given a motto/theme from Latin poetry or literature. A theme for the following year's convention is chosen by the incoming president each year.\n\nMost state-level NJCL chapters hold their own annual conventions at locations central to their attendees, where schools compete in varied events. These events are divided into academic levels for scoring purposes; participation can be countywide, regional, or even statewide. Awards are given out to schools based on sweepstakes points, earned by placing high in competitive events.\n\nThe 2018 national convention was held at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio from July 23-28. The 2019 national convention was held at North Dakota State University in Fargo, North Dakota from July 26-31.\n\nAs of 2010, forty-seven U.S. states, the District of Columbia, three Canadian provinces, and the United Kingdom each maintain a state (or state-level) chapter of the NJCL; the current total number is 51 as Washington state and British Columbia share a chapter. Many chapters hold their own annual State Convention in addition to the National Convention.\n\n\"Torch: U.S.\" is the NJCL's official publication, which details the events of the organization, reports scores, and issues stories. Published four times a year, the only issue sent to all convention attendees (including non-subscribers) is the fall issue, shortly after convention.\n\nUntil October 2007, the NJCL also published \"JCL Highlights\" in months when the \"Torch: U.S.\" was not published. \"JCL Highlights\" publicized administrative details about the League, including details about applying for JCL scholarships, information about the upcoming Convention, and requests for information from NJCL officers and national committee members. According to the Fall 2007 \"Torch: U.S.\", the National Committee decided at the October 2007 Fall Planning Meeting to eliminate the \"JCL Highlights\" in favor of online distribution of the same information.\n\nDuring national conventions, a student published newspaper, \"The Convention Ear\", is produced.

He enjoyed success as manager of Raith Rovers, winning the 1994–95 Scottish League Cup. In recent years he has worked as an assistant coach for several Scottish clubs, including Aberdeen, Kilmarnock, Hibernian, Falkirk and Rangers. His most recent position in club football was as assistant manager of Rangers. Following the departure of manager Graeme Murty, Nicholl took caretaker control of the last three games of the 2017–18 season.\n\nJimmy Nicholl was born in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, to Northern Irish parents. His family moved back to Northern Ireland when he was 3. Nicholl grew up on the Rathcoole estate on the outskirts of Belfast. After he began his football career as an apprentice with Manchester United, the club arranged for Nicholl's family to relocate to England, to avoid the unrest caused by the Troubles in Northern Ireland.\n\nNicholl started his career as a junior player at Manchester United. His senior career started in 1974.

Due to their League Cup triumph, Raith qualified for the 1995–96 UEFA Cup and reached the second round, where they were eliminated by eventual winners Bayern Munich. Having lost the first leg to Bayern 2–0 at Easter Road, Raith took a 1–0 lead at the Olympiastadion thanks to a goal by Danny Lennon. Bayern recovered to win 2–1 on the night and 4–1 on aggregate.\n\nOn 28 February 1996, Nicholl was appointed manager of Millwall, who just over two months earlier had been top of Division One but were now sliding down the table. He was unable to arrest the decline and Millwall slipped into Division Two on the last day of the season. He remained at Millwall until the following February, and six months after that returned to Raith Rovers. His second spell at Raith lasted two years, and ended on 14 June 1999 after he had failed to get them back into the top flight.\n\nA 28-day spell as manager of Dunfermline Athletic followed later in 1999, and he later served as assistant manager to Jimmy Calderwood at East End Park. In May 2004, Nicholl followed Calderwood when he took over as manager at Aberdeen, again serving as his assistant until the two parted company with the club in May 2009.

Nicholl left Hibernian soon after their new management team was recruited.\n\nAfter leaving Hibernian, Nicholl returned to Cowdenbeath for a second stint as their manager. He led the Blue Brazil to avoid relegation via the Scottish Championship play-offs in the 2013–14 season beating local rivals Dunfermline Athletic in the two-legged final. He led the side to the Fife Cup that season. However a very difficult season followed in 2014–15, which included a joint-record 10–0 defeat to eventual champions Heart of Midlothian. The following week, Cowdenbeath managed to draw 0–0 with Rangers. The club was relegated to League One on the last day, after which Nicholl resigned as manager.\n\nWhile still at Cowdenbeath, Nicholl had also become assistant manager to Michael O'Neill with the Northern Ireland national team in March 2015.

{"id": "1920135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1920135", "title": "Pandora's Box (TV series)", "text": "Pandora's Box (TV series)\n\nPandora's Box, subtitled A Fable From the Age of Science, is a BBC television documentary series by Adam Curtis looking at the consequences of political and technocratic rationalism. It won a BAFTA for Best Factual Series in 1993.\n\nCurtis deals with, in order: Communism in the Soviet Union, systems analysis and game theory during the Cold War, economy of the United Kingdom during the 1970s, the insecticide DDT, Kwame Nkrumah's leadership in Ghana in the 1950s, and the history of nuclear power.\n\nThe documentary makes extensive use of clips from the short film \"Design for Dreaming\", especially in the title sequence. Curtis's later series \"The Century of the Self\" and \"The Trap\" have similar themes to \"Pandora's Box\".\n\nThis episode, originally broadcast on 11 June 1992, details how the Bolshevik revolutionaries who came into power in 1917 attempted to industrialise and control the Soviet Union with rational scientific methods. The Bolsheviks wanted to turn the Soviet people into \"scientific beings\". Aleksei Gastev used social engineering, including a social engineering machine, to make people more rational.\n\nBut Bolshevik politicians and bourgeois engineers came into conflict. Lenin said, \"The communists are not directing anything, they are being directed.\" Stalin arrested 2000 engineers in 1930, eight of whom were convicted in the Industrial Party show trial. Engineering schools gave those loyal to the party only limited training in engineering, to minimise their potential political influence. Industrialised America was used as a template to develop the Soviet Union. Magnitogorsk was built to closely replicate the steel mill city Gary, Indiana. A former worker describes how they went so far as to create metal trees since trees could not grow on the steppe.\n\nBy the late 1930s, Stalin-faithful engineers like Leonid Brezhnev, Alexei Kosygin and Nikita Khrushchev grew in influence, due to Stalin eliminating many earlier Bolshevik engineers. They aimed to use engineering in line with Stalin's policies to plan the entire country. At Gosplan, the head institution of central planning, engineers predicted future rational needs. Vitalii Semyonovich Lelchuk, from the USSR Academy of Sciences, describes the level of detail as absurd, \"Even the KGB was told the quota of arrests to be made and the prisons to be used. The demand for coffins, novels and movies was all planned.\" The seemingly rational benchmarks began to have unexpected results. When the plan measured tonnes carried per kilometer, trains went on long journeys simply to meet the quota. Sofas and chandeliers increased in size to meet requirements of material usage.\n\nWhen Nikita Khrushchev took over after Stalin, he tried to make improvements, including considering prices in the plan. The head of the USSR State Committee for Organization and Methodology of Price Creation is shown with a tall stack of price logbooks declaring, \"This shows quite clearly that the system is rational.\" Academician Victor Glushkov proposed the use of cybernetics to control people as a remedy for the problems of planning. In the 1960s, computers began to be used to process economic data. Consumer demand was calculated by computers from data gathered by surveys. But the time delay in the system meant that items were no longer in demand by the time they had been produced.\n\nWhen Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin took over in the mid-1960s, the economy of the Soviet Union was stagnating. By 1978, the country was in full economic crisis. Production had degenerated to a \"pointless, elaborate ritual\" and endeavours to improve the plan had been abandoned. The narrator says, \"What had begun as a grand moral attempt to build a rational society ended by creating a bizarre, bewildering existence for millions of Soviet people.\"\n\n\nThis episode, originally broadcast on 18 June 1992, outlines how the United States government and its departments attempted to use systems analysis and game theory to develop strategies to control the nuclear threat and nuclear arms race during the Cold War, and, more specifically, to manage the \"loss of control\" crises encountered during events such as the Space Race, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the Vietnam War.\n\nThe focus is on the men on whom \"Dr Strangelove\" was allegedly based: Herman Kahn, Albert Wohlstetter and John von Neumann. These were mathematical analysts employed by the American RAND Corporation to examine issues of America's national security in the nuclear age. They believed the world could be controlled by the scientific manipulation of fear. One problem, however, was the seemingly unpredictable and irrational nature of politicians, societies, and individuals, which rendered elements of the theory difficult to apply, as well as the challenge of finding accurate, impartial, and unmodified data on which to base concise predictions. In the end, their visions were obscured and became the stuff of science fiction fantasy.\n\nSimilar material is also covered in the \"\"F**k You Buddy\"\" part of Curtis's later work, \"The Trap\", but \"To The Brink of Eternity\" has the focus entirely on the nuclear and military aspects of Cold War strategy, such as planning for and against pre-emptive war. John Nash is not mentioned, and the psychological and economical aspects of game theory are not included.\n\n\nThis part, originally broadcast on 22 June 1992, focuses on how both the Conservative and Labour governments of the 1960s attempted to use economists to engineer economic growth to specific targets, as well as programme post-war economic management in the United Kingdom, and attempts to prevent relative economic decline and the perception of the 1960s Wilson governments that devaluation would jeopardise against national self-esteem.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, stagflation emerged to confound the Keynesian theories used by policy makers. Meanwhile, a group of economists had managed to convince Margaret Thatcher, Keith Joseph and other British politicians that they had foolproof technical means to make Britain 'great' again. The stagflation of the 1970s catapulted the then obscure economic theory of Monetarism to the forefront of political thought. By the late 1970s Milton Friedman had been awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics and even some Labour politicians were claiming that government attempts to grow the economy by injecting capital was doing more harm than good by driving up inflation. In 1979, Margaret Thatcher came to power and began to implement these new economic theories to drive down inflation by cutting government spending and raising interest rates, thus tightening the money supply. However, this failed to end inflation straight away, and caused widespread job loss and industrial decline. By the early 1980s, unemployment had risen to 2.5 million, British industrial output had declined by 1/6, and large-scale riots had begun to break out in Britain. The Conservative Government decided to abandon the Monetarist project and lowered interest rates in an attempt to create jobs. In fact, by the mid-1980s Mrs Thatcher claimed in a television interview that she had \"never subscribed\" to the theories of Milton Friedman.\n\nThe episode ends with many of the economists involved in the ill-fated attempts to manage the economy arriving at the same conclusion their predecessors had 30 years before: they could only prevent an economic disaster, not engineer growth. Other economists point out that other countries' successes had more to do with focusing on improving their education systems and industrial bases rather than large-scale attempts to engineer the entire nation's economy. Another economist and adviser to Margaret Thatcher, Alan Budd, worries that the whole Monetarist project might simply have been an attempt to reduce the economic and political power of the working class by raising unemployment and lowering wages, or as he puts it, \"creating a reserve army of labour.\"\n\n\nThis part, originally broadcast on 2 July 1992, focuses on attitudes to nature and tells the story of the insecticide DDT, which was first seen as a saviour to humankind in the 1940s, only to be claimed as a part of the destruction of the entire ecosystem in the late 1960s. It also outlines how the sciences of entomology and ecology were transformed by political and economic pressures.\n\nThe episode appears to be named after the 1959 film \"Goodbye, Mrs. Ant\". Clips from the 1958 horror movie \"Earth vs. the Spider\" and the 1941 grasshopper cartoon \"Hoppity Goes to Town\" are also used.\n\nInsects were a huge problem in the United States, and they often ruined entire crops. Emerging in the 1940s, DDT and other insecticides seemed to offer the solution. As more insecticides were invented, the science of entomology changed focus from insect classification, to primarily testing new insecticides and exterminating insects rather than cataloguing them. But as early as 1946–48, entomologists began to notice that insecticides were having a negative impact on other animals, particularly birds.\n\nChemical companies portrayed the human battle against insects as a struggle for existence, and their promotional films in the 1950s invoke Charles Darwin. Darwin's biographer James Moore notes how the battlefield and life and death aspects of Darwin's theories were emphasised to suit the Cold War years. Scientists believed they were seizing power from evolution and redirecting it by controlling the environment.\n\nIn 1962, biologist Rachel Carson released the book \"Silent Spring\", which was the first serious attack on pesticides and outlined their harmful side effects. It caused a public outcry, but had no immediate effect on the use of pesticides. Entomologist Gordon Edwards retells how he made speeches that were critical of Carson's book. He eats some DDT on camera to show how he demonstrated its apparent safety during these talks.\n\nThe spraying of DDT in the growing suburbs on America brought the side effects to the attention of the wealthy and articulate middle classes. Victor Yannacone, a suburbanite and lawyer, helped found the Environmental Defense Fund with the aim to legally challenge the use of pesticides. They argued that the chemicals were becoming more poisonous as they spread, as evidenced by the disappearance of the peregrine falcon.\n\nIn 1968, they got a hearing on DDT in Madison, Wisconsin. It became headline news, with both sides claiming that everything America stood for was at stake. Biologist Thomas Jukes is shown singing a pro-DDT parody on \"America the Beautiful\" he sent to \"Time\" magazine at the time of the trial. Hugh Iltis describes how, in 1969, a scientist testified at the hearing about how DDT appears in breast milk and accumulates in the fat tissue of babies. This got massive media attention.\n\nWhere once chemicals were seen as good, now they were bad. In the late 1960s, ecology was a marginal science. But Yannacone used ecology as a scientific basis to challenge the DDT defenders' idea of evolution. Similar to how the science of entomology had been changed in the 1950s, ecology was transformed by the social and political pressures of the early 1970s. Ecologists became the guardians of the human relationship to nature.\n\nJames Moore describes how people try to get Darwin on the side of their view of nature. In \"The Origin of Species\" nature is seen as being at war, but also likened to a web of complex relations. Here, Darwin gave people a basis for urging humans not to take control of nature but to cooperate with it. In popular imagination, a scientific theory has a single fixed meaning, but in reality it becomes cultural property, and is usable by different interested parties.\n\nTwenty years later, the story of DDT continues with a press conference announcing the halting of construction in a skyscraper due to a nesting peregrine falcon being found there. Ornithologist David Berger criticises the event for helping to foster the myth of the sensitivity of nature.\n\nJoan Halifax talks about ecology as a gift to human beings and all species, a moral lesson that gave rise not to utopia, but ecotopia.\n\nPolitics professor Langdon Winner theorises that social ideals are being read back to us as if they were lessons derived from science itself. The scientific notions of the 1950s, the ideas of endless possibilities for exploitations of nature, are now seen as ill-conceived. And the ideas of ecology today may in 30 or 40 years seem similarly ill-conceived.\n\nThe episode ends with a quote from Darwin about seeking divine providence in nature. \"I feel most deeply that the whole subject is too profound for the human intellect. A dog might as well speculate on the mind of Newton. Let each man hope and believe what he can.\"\n\n\nThe penultimate episode, originally broadcast on 9 July 1992, looks at how Kwame Nkrumah, the leader of the Gold Coast (which became Ghana on independence from the United Kingdom in 1957) from 1952 to 1966, set Africa ablaze with his vision of a new industrial and scientific age. At the heart of his dream was to be the huge Volta River dam, generating enough power to transform West Africa into an industrialised utopia and focal point of post-colonial Pan-Africanism.\n\nAt first, it was hoped the U.K. would help to finance the project, but after the Suez Crisis of 1956, interest was lost. Later, after meeting U.S. Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy, American backing for the project materialised. A scheme was finally drawn up offering Kaiser Aluminum favourable conditions (including the smelting of aluminium imported from outside Ghana) and the dam was opened to great fanfare in January 1966. Weeks later, in February 1966, while Nkrumah was on a state visit to North Vietnam and China, his government was overthrown in a military coup (possibly CIA backed), and evidence of massive corruption and debt was revealed. As of 1992, for many Ghanaians the promised benefits of the project were still unrealised.\n\n\nThis final episode, originally broadcast on 16 July 1992, is named after a 1953 General Electric promotional film called \"A Is for Atom\". The episode gives an insight into the history of nuclear power. In the 1950s, scientists and politicians thought they could create a different world with a limitless source of nuclear energy. But things started to go wrong. Scientists in America and the Soviet Union were duped into building dozens of potentially dangerous nuclear power plants. For business reasons, General Electric and Westinghouse decided that the types sold would be versions based on the reactors used in nuclear submarines, but sold with dubious claims made about their cost effectiveness and safety.\n\nHowever, in 1964, at the Atomic Energy Commission it was found that while small reactors were safe, the bigger core sizes as used in power plants were potentially susceptible to nuclear meltdown—an accident where the reactor core could melt through the bottom of the reactor containment vessel. A study showed this could potentially happen, and if it did, it could damage the reactor. These concerns were largely kept from the public. The episode goes into some detail over attempts to find solutions to the meltdown issue.\n\nIn the Soviet Union, reactors were considered too expensive, until Brezhnev came to power. Under his leadership, Anatoly Petrovich Alexandrov designed cheap reactors that were produced at high speed, with very few safety features, sometimes not even containment vessels. This was publicly criticized by experts, but the experts were sidelined.\n\nIn Britain, by 1974, delays to its native advanced gas cooled reactor power plant caused Britain to adopt the American PWR design of reactors.\n\nHowever, in America it was being discovered that safety systems that had to work to avoid meltdown could not be guaranteed to work reliably in the complex circumstances in a nuclear reactor. Tests run on the emergency core-cooling systems to deal with pipe breaks, performed on the Atomic Energy Commission's test models in Idaho in 1971, repeatedly failed; often the water was forced out of the core under pressure. It was discovered that the theoretical calculations had no correspondence with reality. Nevertheless, they had not necessarily proved that they wouldn't work on a real reactor, so they decided to carry on with mandated safety systems, that the best evidence suggested, may well not function in the event of an accident.\n\nEngineers and scientists and regulators that tried to publicise the potential issues found that their concerns were not published, and these issues remained largely unknown to the public, and nuclear power had a high degree of confidence with the public.\n\nThen came the disasters of Three Mile Island in 1979 and Chernobyl in 1986, which changed public views on the safety of this new technology. It revealed that the industry had been hiding the problems and unpredictable nature of these types of reactors, and that they had imposed risks on the public, without consultation.\n\nIt ends with the points that the forms of the reactors were chosen only for business reasons. There are very broad range of scientific and engineering options which were not explored. Therefore, perhaps nuclear power should be led by public decisions and redeveloped, but from a more morality-centred point of view.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1920138", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1920138", "title": "Prisoners of Power", "text": "Prisoners of Power\n\nPrisoners of Power, also known as Inhabited Island (, ), is a science fiction novel written by Soviet authors Arkady and Boris Strugatsky. It was written in 1969 and originally published in the same year in the literary magazine \"Neva\" (1969, No. 3, 4, and 5, publication of the Leningrad Division of the Union of Soviet Writers). It appeared in a book form in 1971, with great number of changes as demanded by the state censor; the English translation was released in 1977. The protagonist is a youngster from Earth, Maxim Kammerer, who gets stranded on an unknown planet named Saraksh.\n\nMaxim Kammerer is a young amateur space explorer from Earth, regarded as a failure by his friends and relatives because this occupation is not considered to be a serious pursuit. The novel starts when he accidentally discovers an unexplored planet Saraksh inhabited by a humanoid race. The atmospheric conditions on Saraksh are such that the inhabitants believe that they live inside a sphere. The level of technological development on the planet is similar to mid-20th century Earth. The planet recently came through big nuclear and conventional war and the predicament of the population is dire. When Maxim lands, the natives mistake his small spaceship for a weapon and destroy it.\n\nAt first he doesn't take his situation seriously, imagining himself a Robinson Crusoe stranded on an island inhabited by primitive but friendly natives. He is looking forward to establishing contact and befriending the population of the planet. However, the reality turns out to be far from glamorous. After being captured by armed natives and initially taken to what appears to be a concentration camp, Kammerer is sent to some governmental research institute which treats him as a mental patient. He escapes and finds himself in the capital of a totalitarian state, perpetually at war with its neighbors. The city is grim and polluted, with police and military omnipresent.\n\nHe makes friends among the ordinary people that lead the life of privation and misery, while twice daily everyone is overcome by sudden an unexplained bouts of ecstatic enthusiasm, proclaiming their total allegiance and undying gratitude to the country's hidden rulers, known as the \"Unknown Fathers\" (in the censored versions \"Fire-bearing Creators\"), who are said to have the best interests of the people at heart, serving as bulwark against threats foreign and domestic, mainly from the so called \"degens\" (degenerates), the uncompromising enemies of the people, the terrorists who sometimes blow up the anti-ballistic missile (ABM) towers strewn around the country.\n\nAll this makes little sense to Maxim, since his own society is free from war, hostility, crime and material shortages. Still confused about the official ideology, Kammerer gets enlisted in the military, to serve and protect the state and its people. He is ordered to execute some captured degens, one of them a woman. When he refuses, he is shot multiple times, survives, and joins the underground which consists of the degens who suffer great headaches twice daily. Degens believe that the ABM towers are responsible for that.\n\nMaxim participates in an attack on one such tower. Captured, tried and sent to a concentration camp in the South, the same one where he has made his landing, he is finally revealed the truth about the towers by a fellow prisoner high ranking member of the underground. They turn out to be broadcasting a mind control signal, employed by the Fathers to control the population.\n\nThe constant low-intensity broadcast suppresses the ability of most people to evaluate information critically, making the omnipresent regime propaganda much more effective. In addition, twice a day an intense signal relieves mental stresses caused by the disconnect between the propaganda and the observed reality by inducing euphoria in the susceptible majority, and intense headaches in others who are immune to the signal's coercive power. Those are the only sober-thinking people in the country, including both the underground degens and the Fathers themselves.\n\nAstonished and appalled by this revelation, Kammerer makes it his mission to rid the planet of the mind control broadcast system. Several of his schemes fail because the cure may be worse than the disease. He escapes to the radioactive South in hopes of organizing an invasion, but the mutants dwelling there are weakly and softhearted, and the tribes further South are ruthless barbarians. He then turns to the state's neighbor — the Island Empire — but abandons this plan after finding documents on a destroyed Empire submarine that describe mass killings and other atrocities that the Empire military routinely perpetrates.\n\nHe now focuses on trying to find and destroy the Control Center where the mind control broadcasts originate. Meanwhile, the Fathers decide to start a small victorious war on the country's northern neighbor, Honti. Kammerer surrenders to local gendarmes and is assigned to a penal battalion that is supposed to lead the invasion of the North. In this abortive action, most of his friends perish while Kammerer himself barely escapes annihilation in retaliatory nuclear blasts. Having served in the war, he earns himself a rehabilitation from the state and is installed in a secret research institution at the behest of a powerful Father known as the Wanderer, who remains out of reach.\n\nA Father known as the Smarty realizes that Kammerer is not affected by the broadcasts in \"any\" way and plots to use him to stage a coup and take over the state. His plan is for Kammerer to capture the Control Center and use its transmissions to incapacitate his rivals and install him as the new ruler in the minds of the population. The Center is protected by intense depression-inducing local broadcast field that makes it impossible for any native to penetrate it. The Smarty reveals the Center's location to Kammerer, who plays along; however, after penetrating the Center, he destroys it instead, thus disabling the whole system countrywide.\n\nIt is revealed that the powerful Father, the Wanderer, is in fact a human progressor named Rudolf Sikorski, carefully working in secret to gradually improve the lot of the people of Saraksh. His plans now ruined, the Wanderer finally catches up with Maxim and lambasts him for his interference. He describes the unanticipated consequences of Kammerer's rash actions: up to 20% of the people may die or go insane due to the withdrawal from the mind control signal; Saraksh faces famine, anarchy, widespread radioactive pollution, and looming invasion by the Island Empire which they planned to stop using the depression field. The Wanderer orders Kammerer to leave the planet but Maxim refuses and stays on, to help stabilize the situation. Despite the many upheavals that Saraksh has ahead of her, he is still glad he destroyed the Control Center because now the people can be in charge of their own destiny.\n\nAccording to Boris Strugatsky's later reminiscences, the Strugatsky brothers were planning to write a sequel to \"Inhabited Island\". However, following the death of Arkady Strugatsky, the surviving brother felt that he could not bring himself to write the novel. The novel would have been named \"White Ferz\" (\"Белый Ферзь\"). Ferz - the Russian term for Queen in chess, which has male gender in Russian. The novel would have followed the story of the infiltration of Maxim Kammerer, now a progressor, into the heart of the Island Empire.\n\nThe Island Empire would have been shown as consisting of several social \"circles\". While the outer circle represents a fascist militaristic society, the middle circle is a peaceful liberal society, and the inner core is a highly developed harmonic society of intellectuals, similar to the Noon Universe Earth. A special social apparatus directs each citizen of the Empire according to his personality to the circle where he belongs.\n\nThe book would have shown that this cruel social selection of the Island Empire is the more (or even the only) realistic way for a social utopia to exist, and by contrast would doubt if the Noon Universe's Earth is realistically possible, so much so that it is actually suggested to Maxim by one of the leaders of the Inner Circle (when he finally makes contact with them) that his \"Earth\" is really an imaginary world, some literary invention that is impossible to have existed in the real world (serving as the authors' final judgement upon their own creation).\n\nTwo other sequels exist, \"Beetle in the Anthill\" and \"The Time Wanderers\", but their plots are almost independent from the first book: while they have the common characters, Maxim Kammerer and Rudolf Sikorski, the events of \"Inhabited Island\" are only briefly mentioned. The events that authors planned to describe in \"White Ferz\" took place at some time between the events of \"Beetle in the Anthill\" and \"The Time Wanderers\".\n\nThere have been three PC games based on the novel released in 2007: adventure game \"\" developed by Step Creative Group, strategy \"Galactic Assault\" developed by Wargaming and first-person shooter \"\" by Orion Games.\n\nA two-part Russian movie adaptation was released in December 2008 and April 2009.\n\nThe first English translation, by H.S. Jacobson, is based on the censored version of the novel, as the original version was unavailable to the translator.\n\nThe second English translation, by Andrew Bromfield, reflects the original version.\n\n"}
{"id": "1920142", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1920142", "title": "Davis Mountains", "text": "Davis Mountains\n\nThe Davis Mountains, originally known as Limpia Mountains, are a range of mountains in West Texas, located near Fort Davis, after which they are named. The fort was named for then United States Secretary of War and later Confederate President Jefferson Davis. They are a popular site for camping and hiking and the region includes Fort Davis National Historic Site and Davis Mountains State Park. The historical and architectural value of the fort, along with the rugged natural environment of the park are a significant destination for tourism in Texas.\nMost of the land in the Davis Mountains is under private ownership as ranch land, but the Nature Conservancy owns or has conservation easements on more than . \n\nRather than being a single coherent range, the Davis Mountains are an irregular jumble of isolated peaks and ridges separated by flatter areas. The mountains occupy a rough square about on each side. The mountains are of volcanic origin composed of strata associated with eruptions of the Trans-Pecos Texas volcanic field 35 million years ago. The highest peak in the Davis Mountains is Mount Livermore at the fifth-highest peak in Texas.\n\nThe Davis Mountains are a sky island, an isolated mountain range surrounded by desert. The town of Fort Davis at the foot of the Davis Mountains has an elevation of . From that elevation, the sky island rises to . As the elevation increases, average temperatures decline and precipitation increases, permitting an \"island\" of forest and other mesic habitat at higher elevations. \nThe most common vegetation of the Davis Mountains is montane grassland, often mixed with scattered bushes and trees. As is common in most Northern Hemisphere semiarid climates the vegetation on the southern slopes of the mountains is noticeably sparser than on the northern slopes. This is due to the greater exposure to the sun on southern slopes, thus warmer temperatures and drier soils.\n\nMixed in with the grassland, and usually at higher elevations, are four woodland and forest zones. First, at elevations below and at higher, drier elevations, the dominate tree species is the alligator juniper mixed with oak species and pinyon pine. Secondly, woodlands with pinyon pine as the most common species are found on steep slopes at elevations of . Third, woodlands in which the gray oak is the most common tree and mixed with other oak species are also found on steep slopes at elevations of . The gray oak woodlands are found in slightly moister soils than the pinyon woodlands.\n\nThe richest and most diverse of the woodlands and forests in the Davis Mountains are the mesic forests found from . These forests are found in stream valleys and other well-watered areas. Indicator species are ponderosa pine and southwestern white pine, plus two small groves of quaking aspen at elevations of at the base of the cliffs surrounding the summit of Mount Livermore. Aspens are more characteristic of the higher elevations in the Rocky Mountains. The mesic woodlands are remnants of past glacial ages in which the climate of West Texas was more humid and cooler than at present.\n\nOver 277 species of birds have been seen at Davis Mountains State Park. Many species found here are characteristic of more northerly mountain climes or alternatively of nearby Mexico, including 10 species of hummingbirds. Large mammals found here include whitetail deer, mule deer, elk, black bear, cougar, pronghorn, peccary, and introduced species such as aoudad and feral hogs. Several private ranches in the Davis Mountains offer hunting opportunities.\n\nNearly all of the Davis Mountains fall into the climate classification of \"BS\" (semiarid steppe) in the Köppen climate classification system. However, the highest elevations may transition into a cooler, wetter \"Cfb \"climate (subtropical humid with warm summers). \n\nMost of the Davis Mountains are in private ownerships. However, since 1996, the Nature Conservancy has acquired 33,000 acres (130 km²) in the Davis Mountains range, along with conservation easements on 70,000 adjoining acres (280 km²) of private ranchland. The Davis Mountain Preserve is open to the public at specified times.\n\nMcDonald Observatory is accessed by Spur 78 from State Highway 118. Spur 78 is the highest state maintained road in Texas at 6,791 feet near the summit of Mt. Locke where the older telescopes of the observatory are located. Spur 77 branches off from Spur 78 providing access to the newer research equipment atop Mt. Fowlkes.\nThe Texas separatist organization known as the Republic of Texas has its origins in the Davis Mountains. On April 27, 1996, the leader of the group, Rick McLaren, staged an attack on his neighbor's house and demanded that he cede his property to the Republic of Texas. This led to 300 state troopers surrounding his house with his five followers, his wife, the victims of the attack, and him inside for close to a week. Ultimately, one follower was shot in the standoff and McLaren was arrested and imprisoned for the equivalent of a life sentence.\n\n"}

He represented Denmark at the Euro 1984 and 1986 World Cup tournaments.\n\nHe started his senior career for Næstved IF, and made his debut for the Danish national team in a July 1980 friendly match against the Soviet Union. He had a trial with Arsenal FC in 1978–79, scoring a goal in a reserve team game. Ajax initially tried to sign Olsen in 1980, but it was only in July 1981 that he moved to play professionally for Ajax in the Netherlands.\n\nWhile playing for Ajax, Olsen became well known for his part in the infamous \"passed penalty\" routine he performed with Johan Cruyff. When Cruyff was awarded a penalty kick in a Dutch Eredivisie league match against Helmond Sport on 5 December 1982, with Ajax leading 1–0, Cruyff passed the ball sideways to Olsen, who returned it to Cruyff, with the Dutchman then slotting the ball past the bemused goalkeeper to make the score 2–0. It was allowed by the referee because the penalty is a direct free kick, so it can also be taken indirectly.\n\nDuring his stay with Ajax, Olsen earned the nickname \"De Vlo\" (The Flea) due to his posture and his ability to twist, turn and jump to avoid tackles. He was also called \"The Untouchable\". The Ajax coach in the 1981–82 season, Kurt Linder, regarded him the most surprisingly talented player in the young Ajax squad, both technically and tactically phenomenal.\n\nHe won the 1981–82 Eredivisie championship in his first season at the club. The next season, 1982–83, Ajax successfully defended the Eredivisie title, and also won the Dutch Cup to complete The Double. Olsen scored twice in the qualification tournament for Euro 1984, including a last-minute equaliser in the 2–2 draw against England. He was selected to represent Denmark at the finals tournament, and played two games, including Denmark's semi-final against Spain. The game ended a draw, but even though Olsen scored in the penalty shootout, Denmark were eliminated when Preben Elkjær missed his shot.\n\nOlsen moved from Ajax to England in July 1984, joining Manchester United for a fee of £350,000, signed by manager Ron Atkinson. He scored a total of 24 goals for the Reds in more than four years at Old Trafford, including a hat-trick against West Bromwich Albion in a 3–0 Football League First Division home win on 22 February 1986. He succeeded Dutchman Arnold Muhren as United's regular left winger, at a time when foreign players still relatively rare in the English game.\n\nHe collected an FA Cup winner's medal in 1985, when United beat Everton 1–0 in the final at Wembley, having ousted veteran Dutch midfielder Arnold Mühren on the left wing that season. He also helped them establish a runaway lead at the top of the First Division in the first half of the 1985–86 season, where they won their first 10 league games and remained top of the table until well into the new year before floundering and finishing fourth in the table.\n\nAtkinson signed winger Peter Barnes for United at the start of the 1985–86 season, who provided cover on the left wing when Olsen was out of action with injury, but after Olsen regained his fitness and form, Barnes was sold to Manchester City in January 1987.\n\nAlready an established member of the Danish national team, he was called up to the Danish squad for the 1986 World Cup, and scored two goals in the three preliminary group stage matches, but he will always be remembered for making a grave mistake in the round of 16 match against Spain. He gave Denmark the lead on a penalty kick, but just before half-time he collected a ball from goalkeeper Lars Høgh. When he tried to return the ball to Høgh, his pass ended up straight in front of Emilio Butragueño instead. The Spanish striker levelled the game, and eventually went on to score four goals in the game that Denmark lost 5–1. Consequently, the term \"en rigtig Jesper Olsen\" (a real Jesper Olsen) entered the Danish lexicon.\n\nDuring October 1986, Olsen had a training ground bust-up with midfield colleague Remi Moses and by the end of the month he was put on the transfer list by manager Ron Atkinson. However, Atkinson was sacked as manager a week later due to United's dismal start to the season, and his successor Alex Ferguson took Olsen off the transfer list and he would stay at Old Trafford for two more years, even passing up the chance to sign John Barnes from Watford in the summer of 1987 due to his faith in Olsen.\n\nThrough his later years at Old Trafford, Olsen had a hard time adapting to the changing English game, and saw his footballing development stagnate. He was selected for the Denmark team at the Euro 1988, but did not play any games at the tournament.\n\nOlsen's Manchester United career ended in the 1988–89 season, and he transferred to Bordeaux of France for £400,000 in November 1988. In his final full season at Old Trafford, United had finished runners-up to Liverpool in the league. His final United goal had come on 12 December 1987 in a 3–1 home win over Oxford United.\n\nIn 1990, he left Bordeaux to play as a wingback for Caen. After suffering a serious injury, he left Caen and retired in 1992, despite being offered the chance to return to English football with Blackburn Rovers and Nottingham Forest.\n\nOlsen has maintained a low profile since his retirement as a player, and now lives in Brighton, Victoria, Australia. In 2003, he founded and commenced operating the Fun Football Group in Australia.\n\nHe was admitted to hospital on 4 May 2006 after suffering a subarachnoid haemorrhage. He had just returned from jogging, when he first felt the effects of the haemorrhage, and said, \"It was frightening to feel the loss of control\".\n\nAfter recovering from the haemorrhage, Olsen visited Australia coach Guus Hiddink at the Australian World Cup preparation camp in Melbourne. Olsen was acquainted with Hiddink through his friends Søren Lerby and Frank Arnesen. \"I'm doing well, but it was a quite scary experience\", Olsen told the Dutch newspaper \"De Telegraaf\". The newspaper described Jesper Olsen as looking somewhat fatigued, but otherwise appearing as his usual self. \n\nIn 2011 the Fun Football Group became a part of the Football Star Academy, of which Olsen was appointed as Director of coaching. He oversees the Elite training program, and passes on his worldly knowledge and experiences to new budding football stars.\n\nFootball Star Academy was instrumental in George Lambadaridis being given a chance to participate in European Football in a move to Club Belgian Club Brugge K.V., and works with Clubs all over Europe such as Panathinaikos F.C. in Greece, and Ipswich Town F.C. in England to link Australian talent to international opportunities.\n\nIn 2009, Olsen became one of the Assistant Managers of A-League club, Melbourne Heart.\n\nAjax\n\nManchester United\n\n"}

Carrière was a frequent collaborator with Luis Buñuel on the screenplays of Buñuel's late French films.\n\nCarrière was born in Colombières-sur-Orb, France, the son of Alice and Felix Carrière, a farmer. He published his first novel, \"Lézard\", in 1957. He was introduced to Jacques Tati, who had him write short novels based on his films. Through Tati, he met Pierre Étaix, with whom Carrière wrote and directed several films, including \"Heureux Anniversaire\", which won them the Academy Award for Best Short Subject. His nineteen-year collaboration with Buñuel began with the film \"Diary of a Chambermaid\" (1964); he co-wrote the screenplay with Buñuel and also played the part of a village priest. Carrière and the director would collaborate on the scripts of nearly all Buñuel's later films, including \"Belle de Jour\" (1967), \"The Milky Way\" (1969), \"The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie\" (1972), \"The Phantom of Liberty\" (1974) and \"That Obscure Object of Desire\" (1977).\n\nHe also wrote screenplays for \"The Tin Drum\" (1979), \"Danton\" (1983), \"The Return of Martin Guerre\" (1982), \"La dernière image\" (1986), \"The Unbearable Lightness of Being\" (1988), \"Valmont\" (1989), \"Cyrano de Bergerac\" (1990), \"Birth\" (2004), and \"Goya's Ghosts\", and co-wrote \"Max, Mon Amour\" (1986) with director Nagisa Oshima.

{"id": "1920165", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1920165", "title": "Demel", "text": "Demel\n\nDemel (colloquially \"der Demel\") is a famous pastry shop and chocolaterie established in 1786 in Vienna, Austria. The company bears the title of a Purveyor to the Imperial and Royal Court (\"k.u.k. Hofzuckerbäcker\") up to today. The pastry shop and chocolaterie is closed until further notice (per their website as of 24th of May 2020).\n\nThe building is located in the central Innere Stadt district on Kohlmarkt 14 near Hofburg Palace. The interior was designed by Portois and Fix decorators in a Neo-baroque style. The white-aproned waitresses — the \"Demelinerinnen\" — usually address the customers in a traditional honorific third person style, \"\"Haben schon gewählt?\"\" or \"\"Wollen etwas zu sich nehmen, wenn belieben?\"\". The cabaret artist Helmut Qualtinger extolled their timeless quality in his song \"Die Demelinerinnen\".\n\nDemel temporarily had one additional location in Salzburg, which was closed in March 2012. The company formerly had a small cafe at The Plaza's Retail Collection in New York City, but this location has since closed (as of March 2010). The corporate website indicates they are continuing to look for a new location to operate in New York.\n\nThe \"k.k. Hofzuckerbäckerei\" pastry shop was founded on Michaelerplatz by Ludwig Dehne, a confectioner from Württemberg. Upon his early death in 1799, the business was continued by his widow for their minor son August Dehne. In 1813 she purchased the house on Michaelerplatz 14. August Dehne inherited the company in 1832 and successfully managed the business, however, as his son pursued an academic career, he sold the company to his journeyman Christoph Demel in 1857.\n\nRenamed \"Ch. Demel's Söhne\" in 1867, Christoph Demel's sons Joseph and Karl continued the business and were granted the title of a purveyor to the Habsburg court by Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria in 1874. When in 1888 the old Burgtheater on Michaelerplatz was demolished combined with a general refurbishment of the whole square, they moved the confectionery around the corner to Kohlmarkt, where the company is still located today in its original building. In the heyday of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, notable customers included Empress Elisabeth (\"Sisi\"), Princess Pauline von Metternich, and actress Katharina Schratt. During the Austrian \"Anschluss\" to Nazi Germany 1938–45, the Vienna \"Gauleiter\" Baldur von Schirach and his wife Henriette were regulars here.\n\nThe company was headed by Demel's heirs until 1972, when the entrepreneur Udo Proksch bought it and established the \"Club 45\" on the first floor, a popular venue of the Vienna high society. After Proksch was arrested for his involvement in the \"Lucona\" affair in 1989, the Raiffeisen Bank became the owner of the famous company. In 2002 the Do & Co restaurants and catering company took over Demel.\n\nIn the early decades of the twentieth century, a legal battle over the use of the label \"The Original Sacher Torte\" developed between the Hotel Sacher and the Demel bakery. Eduard Sacher, son of Franz Sacher, the inventor of Sachertorte, had completed his own recipe of his father's cake during his time at Demel, which was the first establishment to offer the \"Original\" cake. Following the death of Eduard's widow Anna in 1930 and the bankruptcy of the Hotel Sacher in 1934, Eduard Sacher's son (also named Eduard Sacher) found employment at Demel and brought to the bakery the sole distribution right for an \"Eduard-Sacher-Torte\".\n\nThe first differences of opinion arose in 1938, when the new owners of the Hotel Sacher began to sell Sacher Tortes from vendor carts under the trademarked name \"The Original Sacher Torte\". After interruptions brought about by the Second World War and the ensuing Allied occupation, the hotel owners sued Demel in 1954, with the hotel asserting its trademark rights and the bakery claiming it developed and bought the title \"Original Sacher Torte\".\n\nOver the next seven years, both parties waged an intense legal war over several of the dessert's specific characteristics, including the change of the name, the second layer of jam in the middle of the cake, and the substitution of margarine for butter in the baking of the cake. The author Friedrich Torberg, who was a frequent guest at both establishments, served as a witness during this process and testified that, during the lifetime of Anna Sacher, the cake was never covered with marmalade or cut through the middle. In 1963 both parties agreed on an out of court settlement that gave the Hotel Sacher the rights to the phrase \"The Original Sachertorte\" and gave the Demel the rights to decorate its tortes with a triangular seal that reads \"Eduard-Sacher-Torte\".\n\nThe Vienna site features a museum with artifacts about the history of the Imperial chocolate-making bakery.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1920181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1920181", "title": "Dom (mountain)", "text": "Dom (mountain)\n\nThe Dom is a mountain of the Pennine Alps, located between Randa and Saas-Fee in the canton of Valais. With its summit it is the third highest mountain in the Alps and the second highest in Switzerland, after Monte Rosa. The Dom is the main summit of the Mischabel group (German: \"Mischabelhörner\"), which is the highest massif lying entirely in Switzerland.\n\nAlthough \"Dom\" is a German cognate for 'dome', it can also mean 'cathedral' and the mountain is named after Canon Berchtold of Sitten cathedral, the first person to survey the vicinity.\n\nThe former name \"Mischabel\" comes from an ancient German dialect term for \"pitchfork\", as the highest peaks of the massif stand close to each other.\n\nThe Dom is the culminating point of a chain running from the Schwarzberghorn on the south, at the intersection with the main chain of the Alps (Alpine watershed), to the Distelhorn on the north and ending above the town of Stalden. The chain lies entirely in the district of Visp.\nThe two valleys separated by the range are the Mattertal on the west and the Saastal on the east. The towns of Randa and Saas-Fee lie both six kilometres from the summit (to the west and the east, respectively). The elevation difference between the summit and the valley floor is 3,150 metres on the west side (Randa) and 3,000 metres on the east side (Saas-Grund). On the Mattertal side, the Dom faces the almost equally high Weisshorn and, on the Saastal side, it faces the Weissmies. The Dom is the highest point of the Saastal and the second highest mountain of the Mattertal after Monte Rosa.\n\nSince the Dom is not on the main Alpine chain, the rivers flowing on both the west and east side of the massif end up in the same major river, the Rhone, through the Mattervispa and the Saaservispa. The Dom is the highest mountain in the Alps with this peculiarity.\n\nThe Mischabel group includes many subsidiary summits above 4,000 metres. To the north lies the Nadelgrat, composed of the Lenzspitze, the Nadelhorn, the Stecknadelhorn, the Hohberghorn and the Dürrenhorn. The Nadelgrat is easily visible from the north and gives the massif its characteristic pitchfork appearance. The second highest peak of the massif, the Täschhorn to the south, culminates at 4,491 metres, and south of it, is the characteristically flat summit of the Alphubel. In total, eight summits above 4,000 metres make up the Mischabel massif. Other important peaks of the massif are the Ulrichshorn and the Balfrin. The Dom has a western shoulder (4,479 m) and an eastern shoulder (4,468 m).\n\nGenerally, areas above 3,000 metres are covered by glaciers, the two largest being the Ried Glacier situated at the foot of the Nadelgrat and the Fee Glacier, at the foot of the Dom itself, below the east face.\n\nThe massif is almost entirely composed of gneiss from the Siviez-Mischabel nappe. The latter is part of the Briançonnais microcontinent and is located in the Penninic nappes. The Dom is a depositional mountain.\n\nThe first ascent was made from the Festigrat (north-west ridge) by the Reverend John Llewelyn-Davies with guides Johann Zumtaugwald, Johann Krönig and Hieronymous Brantschen on 11 September 1858.\nThe first ascent of the western ridge (above the Festikinlücke) was made in 4.9.1878 by Mrs E. P. Jackson and Percy W. Thomas with the guides Aois Pollinger, Josef Truffer, Josef Marie Biner, Josef Imboden and Josef Lengen of St. Niklaus in the canton Valais. They traversed the west face to reach the Festigrat before arriving to the summit. The first complete ascent on the western ridge was made later in 1882 by Paul Güssfeldt and guides Alexander Burgener and B. Venetz. The direct route on the west face was first ascended in 1962.\n\nThe 1000-metre-high east face above Saas-Fee was climbed in 1875 by J. Petrus, A. and W. Puckle and L. Noti.\n\nA route on the south face was first made in August 1906 by Geoffrey Winthrop Young and R. G. Major, with the guides Josef Knubel and Gabriel Lochmatter of St. Niklaus in the canton Valais. According to Young it was more dangerous than the south-west face of the nearby Täschhorn, which they had climbed two weeks earlier.\n\nOn 18 June 1917, Arnold Lunn, a pioneer ski mountaineer, and Josef Knubel of St. Niklaus in the canton Valais made the first ski ascent of the Dom, by the Hohberg Glacier (north flank).\n\nDespite its considerable height above the surrounding valleys, the Dom can be climbed quite easily, as the normal route does not present major difficulties. It is however a demanding 3,100-metre ascent with objective danger in the upper part. Cable cars and other facilities are located only in the Saas-Fee area on the east side of the mountain, from which all the routes are difficult.\n\nThe easiest way to the summit starts from Randa, where there is a railway station (1,407 m) served by the Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn. From Randa a trail leads to the Dom Hut (2,940 m), which also crosses the Europaweg near the Europa Hut. Climbing the mountain requires an overnight stay. Most popular sleeping sites are the Dom hut and the camping place one hour higher from the hut. The hut needs to be booked in advance and is not free to use like the camping place. The normal route starts from the hut and goes on the Festigletscher glacier towards the Festijoch pass (3,720 m). Then it follows the Hohberggletscher glacier to the summit above the north face. The Festigrat, traversed on the first ascent, is the north-western ridge going directly from the Festijoch to the summit. It is preferred by climbers who wish to avoid the long slopes of the north flank.\n\nThe Mischabel Hut, on the east side below the Lenzspitze, is generally used for the ascent of lower summits in the district, such as the Nadelhorn, Lenzspitze, and other peaks on the Nadelgrat.\n\n"}

He spent nine years at United, where he was captain, helping the club to two First Division titles and an FA Cup. He won three caps for England in 1905.\n\nBorn in Darlington, Roberts started his football career with Bishop Auckland, but soon moved to Grimsby Town.\n\nIn 1904, he was transferred to Manchester United for £600. The United manager at the time was Ernest Mangnall who had embarked on a spending spree which would later see Manchester City players Billy Meredith and Sandy Turnbull arrive at Bank Street, United's ground at the time. Roberts arrival at United was extremely important to the development of the club; a strong, skilful, fast centre half and a rebel to boot. He flouted FA rules by wearing his shorts above the knee and was politically minded in favour of the unionisation of professional footballers.\n\nPlaying as centre-half he helped Manchester United win the 1908 and 1911 league titles as well as the 1909 FA Cup. He left the club in August 1913 for a then record fee of £1,500 to Oldham Athletic, who he also went on to manage, after appearing in 299 matches and scoring 23 goals for United.\n\nRoberts was capped three times for England in 1905, Manchester United's first England international. Not until 1983, when a United side captained by Bryan Robson lifted the FA Cup for the fifth time, did another Englishman captain the club to FA Cup glory, as United's captains of their second and third triumphs were both Irish and their fourth FA Cup winning side was captained by a Scotsman.\n\nOn 2 December 1907, Roberts and Meredith were instrumental in setting up the Players' Union. The organisation was not recognised by the FA but it did attract considerable support from fellow League clubs. In August 1909, the FA threatened to suspend any player who admitted to being a member of the Union, following which Roberts and his Manchester United's teammates were summoned to a meeting with the club's management. The players refused to relinquish their Union membership, forcing the club to contact their first opponents of the new season, Bradford City to cancel the fixture, as it could not field a team. The FA's threat had seen the membership of the Union fall so that the only members were the Manchester United players, who called themselves \"The Outcasts\". It was only after Tim Coleman of Everton renewed his support by siding with The Outcasts that the FA relented and Roberts' Union was saved.\n\nIn 1928, together with former colleague Billy Meredith, he became a coach for the ambitious Manchester Central. Roberts' son, Charlie Jr., was a player for Central's first season.\n\nHe died, aged 56, at Manchester Royal Infirmary in August 1939 following a cranial operation after suffering extended \"dizzy spells\".\n\nRoberts' cousin, Harry Hooper, played at full-back for Southampton, Leicester City and Queens Park Rangers. His nephews, Danny, Bill, Mark and Carl Hooper, were all professional footballers, and his nieces, Sarah and Bessie Hooper, played for Darlington Quaker Ladies.

In addition to singing, songwriting and guitar, Wilson co-established and operated Mr. Lady Records from 1996 to 2004.\n\nWilson, born in 1974, was raised in the small town of Jasper, Oregon. As a teenager, Wilson was a member of the band Adickdid, which was distributed by several labels including Yoyo Records and Kill Rock Stars. From there, she went on to Team Dresch, in which she shared singing and songwriting duties with Jody Bleyle. Shortly after Team Dresch released their second album, \"Captain My Captain\", in 1996, Wilson left the group and released a solo acoustic album entitled \"Kaia\". Her second solo album, \"Ladyman\", featured Team Dresch drummer Melissa York, who would later join Wilson in The Butchies.\n\nIn 1998, several songs from \"Kaia\" were rerecorded and appeared on the debut album of her newest band, The Butchies.

{"id": "1920219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1920219", "title": "Battle of Călugăreni", "text": "Battle of Călugăreni\n\nThe Battle of Călugăreni was one of the most important battles in the history of early modern Romania. It took place on 23 August (13 August on old style calendar) 1595 between the Wallachian army led by Michael the Brave and the Ottoman army led by Koca Sinan Pasha. It was part of the Long War, fought between Christian and Ottoman forces at the end of the 16th - beginning of the 17th centuries.\n\nThe whole Ottoman forces were estimated at about 100,000 men, but not all of their troops were on the battlefield at Calugareni. It seems that about 30,000-40,000 Ottoman soldiers were involved in the battle.\n\nMichael the Brave had in total about 36,000 men and 32 large field cannon, with Transylvanian (Székely) detachments.Michael the Brave strategically positioned his forces near a swampy field (near Neajlov River) that would negate the Ottoman's military superiority. South of the village of Călugăreni, where the Câlniştea river flows into Neajlov river, the terrain is a muddy marsh, surrounded by forests. A narrow bridge over the Neajlov river was a mandatory pass point. The battle had three different phases.\n\nThe day of 23 August 1595 started with probing cavalry attacks. The Wallachian cavalry surprised the Ottoman cavalry in front of the village and pushed it over the Neajlov river. Michael the Brave positioned himself with 10,000 troops and 10 cannons north of the Neajlov river and south of the village. The Székely mercenary Captain Albert Király was in charge of the reserve of 6,000 Székely troops. The reserve was positioned rather far, north-west of the village, to stop any possible attack from the direction of the village of Singureni.\n\nAfter the cavalry skirmish, Koca Sinan Pasha sent forward a force 12,000 strong. Michael the Brave waited for the Ottoman forces to cross the river and, after a heavy artillery bombardment, attacked fiercely pushing the Turks back over the river. The first phase of the battle ended favorably for the Wallachians.\n\nThe second phase started at noon, when Sinan Pasha launched a decisive attack with all the forces he had at that moment. Janissaries made a frontal attack over the bridge while other forces made a double flanking maneuver (Mehmet Satirghi Pashha in the east and Hasan Pasha (beylerbey of Rumelia) in the west, passing over Neajlov by the bridge of Singureni).\nJanissaries attacked not only on the bridge, but also used logs and planks to help them cross the marsh. Initially their attack was stopped, but Ottoman cavalry managed to cross the river via a ford in the east and threatened the Wallachian left wing. Michael retreated, abandoning all his cannons. He rallied his troops north of the village where he stopped the Ottoman advance. The second phase of the battle ended favorably for the Ottomans.\n\nThe third and last phase of the battle took place in the afternoon of the day and started with a strong frontal Wallachian attack, led by Michael the Brave. Captain Cocea had just returned from a scouting mission with 400 cavalry and his fresh forces were used in this attack in a flanking maneuver. Mehmet Satîrgi Pasha's troops were pushed into the Janissaries and the Ottoman forces were crowded in a narrow space north of the Neajlov River. The Wallachian counterattack reached the bridge and the cannons were retaken and used to inflict many casualties to the Ottomans. Sinan Pasha tried to restore the situation by advancing with his personal guard, but the Ottoman forces dispersed in disarray when captain Cocea's cavalry attacked them in the rear. The Wallachians attacked the Ottoman camp simultaneously, which was near Hulubeşti village. In the disorganized retreat, legend has it that Michael the Brave, true to his name, took a battle axe and (as Robert the Bruce had done to sir Henry de Bouhen at the battle of Bannockburn) threw Sinan Pasha from his horse and into the marsh, but he was saved by one of his slaves. The Wallachians were unable to pursue the fleeing Ottomans because Hasan Pasha appeared on their right flank. Michael the Brave turned with all his men against Hasan Pasha and routed his forces.\n\nThe casualties are estimated at least 1,000 men for Wallachians, while the Ottoman casualties are thought to be in the range of 10,000 to 15,000. Michael the Brave knew that he still was greatly outnumbered, and during the night he retreated northward. He abandoned both Bucharest and Târgovişte, stopping at the winter camp in Stoieneşti, near the Rucăr-Bran Pass.\n\nSinan Pasha captured the capital, Bucharest, and left there Mehmed Pasha with 10,000 troops, then captured Târgovişte where he left another 1,500 troops and 30 cannons. The bulk of the Ottoman army advanced to Stoieneşti, where it took positions in front of the Wallachian army, but didn’t attack.\n\nOn 6 September, the Transylvanian prince Sigismund Báthory arrived with around 7,500 cavalry to support Michael the Brave. Early October another 1,500 troops from the Habsburg empire and 300 cavalry from Tuscany arrived. These combined forces attacked the Ottomans and eventually defeated them at Târgovişte (18 October), Bucharest (22 October), and Giurgiu (26 October).\n\nIn Romanian:\n\nIn Turkish:\n"}
{"id": "1920222", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1920222", "title": "Electric fence", "text": "Electric fence\n\nAn electric fence is a barrier that uses electric shocks to deter animals and people from crossing a boundary. The voltage of the shock may have effects ranging from discomfort to death. Most electric fences are used today for agricultural fencing and other forms of animal control, although they are also used to protect high-security areas such as military installations or prisons, where potentially lethal voltages may be used.\n\nElectric fences are designed to create an electrical circuit when touched by a person or animal. A component called a power energizer converts power into a brief high voltage pulse. One terminal of the power energizer releases an electrical pulse along a connected bare wire about once per second. Another terminal is connected to a metal rod implanted in the earth, called a ground or earth rod. A person or animal touching both the wire and the earth during a pulse will complete an electrical circuit and will conduct the pulse, causing an electric shock. The effects of the shock depend upon the voltage, the energy of the pulse, the degree of contact between the recipient and the fence and ground and the route of the current through the body; it can range from barely noticeable to uncomfortable, painful or even lethal.\n\nEarly alternating current (AC) fence chargers used a transformer and a mechanically driven switch to generate the electrical pulses. The pulses were wide and the voltage unpredictable, with no-load peaks in excess of 10,000 volts and a rapid drop in voltage as the fence leakage increased. The switch mechanism was prone to failure. Later systems replaced the switch with a solid-state circuit, with an improvement in longevity but no change in pulse width or voltage control.\n\n\"Weed burner\" fence chargers were popular for a time and featured a longer-duration output pulse that would destroy weeds touching the fence. These were responsible for many grass fires when used during dry weather. Although still available, they have declined in popularity.\n\nMost modern fences emit pulses of high voltage at a given interval of time, and don't take into account whether there is an animal or person touching the conductive wires, except for the voltage multiplier based electric fence charger that stores high voltage potential and dumps its charges as soon as a conductive load (grounded animal/person) touches the wires.\n\nDepending on the area to be fenced and remoteness of its location, fence energizers may be hooked into a permanent electrical circuit, they may be run by lead-acid or dry cell batteries, or a smaller battery kept charged by a solar panel. The power consumption of a fence in good condition is low, and so a lead-acid battery powering several hundred metres of fence may last for several weeks on a single charge. For shorter periods dry cell batteries may be used. Some energizers can be powered by more than one source.\n\nSmooth steel wire is the material most often used for electric fences, ranging from a fine thin wire used as a single line to thicker, high-tensile (HT) wire. Less often, woven wire or barbed wire fences can be electrified, though such practices create a more hazardous fence, particularly if a person or animal becomes caught by the fencing material (electrified barbed wire is unlawful in some areas). Synthetic webbing and rope-like fencing materials woven with fine conducting wires (usually of stainless steel) have become available over the last 15 to 20 years, and are particularly useful for areas requiring additional visibility or as temporary fencing.\n\nThe electrified fence itself must be kept insulated from the earth and from any materials that will conduct electricity and ignite or short out the fence. Fencing must therefore avoid vegetation, and cannot be attached directly to wood or metal posts. Typically, wooden or metal posts are driven into the ground and plastic or porcelain insulators are attached to them, or plastic posts are used. The conducting material is then attached to the posts.\n\nElectrified palisade fences are usually made from painted mild steel, galvanized steel, stainless steel or aluminium. Typically the fences are and typically send high voltage electric pulses through the palisade at a frequency of 1 Hz (one pulse per second).\n\nPalisade electric fences are used in most countries, particularly where there is little vegetation to short circuit the fence or where the costs of security personnel is high in relation to automated security equipment. The electric pulse is a strong deterrent for criminals, while the palisade fence is mechanically stronger than a typical steel cable electric fence, being able to withstand impact from wildlife, small falling trees and wildfires.\n\nDue to the high levels of crime in South Africa, it is common for residential houses to have perimeter defences. The City of Johannesburg promotes the use of palisade fencing over opaque, usually brick, walls as criminals cannot hide as easily behind the fence. In the City of Johannesburg manual on safety one can read about best practices and maintenance of palisade fencing, such as not growing vegetation in front of palisades as this allows criminals to make an unseen breach.\n\nFirst published in 1832, Chapter 7 of \"Domestic Manners of the Americans\" by Fanny Trollope describes an arrangement of wires connected with an electrical machine used to protect a display called \"Dorfeuille's Hell\" in the Western Museum of natural history in Cincinnati, which she herself invented. Published in 1870, Chapter 22 of Jules Verne's \"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\", describes, \"The Lightning Bolts of Captain Nemo\" the use of electrification of a structure as a defensive weapon. Published in 1889, Mark Twain's novel \"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\", uses an electric fence for defensive purposes.\n\nDavid H. Wilson obtained United States Patent 343,939 in 1886, combining protection, an alarm bell, and telephone communications. He constructed an experimental 30-mile electric fence energized by a water wheel in Texas in 1888, but it was not successful.\n\nIn 1905, the Russian army improvised electric fences during the Russo-Japanese War at Port Arthur. In 1915, during World War I, the German army installed the \"Wire of Death\", an electrified fences along the border between Belgium and the Netherlands to prevent unauthorized movement of people across the border. The fences covered 300 kilometres and consisted of several strands of copper wire, backed with barbed wire, and energized to several thousand volts. An estimated 3,000 human fatalities were caused by the fence, as well as the destruction of livestock.\n\nElectric fences were used to control livestock in the United States in the early 1930s, and electric fencing technology developed in both the United States and New Zealand.\n\nAn early application of the electric fence for livestock control was developed in 1936–1937 by New Zealand inventor Bill Gallagher. Built from a car ignition trembler coil set, Gallagher used the device to keep his horse from scratching itself against his car. Gallagher later started the Gallagher Group to improve and market the design. In 1962, another New Zealand inventor, Doug Phillips, invented the non-shortable electric fence based on capacitor discharge. This significantly increased the range an electric fence could be used from a few hundred metres to 35 km (~20 miles), and reduced the cost of fencing by more than 80%. The non-shortable electric fence was patented by Phillips and by 1964 was manufactured by Plastic Products, a New Zealand firm, under the name \"Waikato Electric Fence.\" This idea was to replace ceramic with plastic insulators. A variety of plastic insulators are now used on farms throughout the world today.\n\nBy 1939, public safety concerns in the United States prompted Underwriters' Laboratories to publish a bulletin on electric shock from electric fences, leading to the ANSI/UL standard No. 69 for electric fence controllers.\n\nIn 1969 Robert B. Cox, a farmer in Adams County, Iowa, invented an improved electric fence bracket and was issued United States Patent No. 3,516,643 on June 23, 1970. This bracket improved electric fences by keeping the wire high enough above the ground and far enough away from the fence to permit grass and weeds growing beneath the wire to be mowed. The brackets attached to the posts by what may be called a \"pivot bind\" or \"torsion-lock.\" The weight of the bracket, the attached insulator and the electric wire attached to the insulator bind the bracket to the post.\n\nElectric fences have improved significantly over the years. Improvements include:\n\nPermanent electric fencing is used in many agricultural areas, as construction of electric fences can be much cheaper and faster than conventional fences (it uses plain wire and much lighter construction, as the fence does not need to physically restrain animals). The risk of injury to livestock (particularly horses) is lower compared to fences made of barbed wire or certain types of woven wire with large openings that can entangle the feet.\n\nIts disadvantages include the potential for the entire fence to be disabled due to a break in the conducting wire, shorting out if the conducting wire contacts any non-electrified component that may make up the rest of the fence, power failure, or forced disconnection due to the risk of fires starting by dry vegetation touching an electrified wire. Other disadvantages can be lack of visibility and the potential to shock an unsuspecting human passer-by who might accidentally touch or brush the fence.\n\nMany fences are made entirely of standard smooth or high-tensile wire, although high quality synthetic fencing materials are also beginning to be used as part of permanent fences, particularly when visibility of the fence is a concern.\n\nConventional agricultural fencing of any type may be strengthened by the addition of a single electric line mounted on insulators attached to the top or front of the fence. A similar wire mounted close to the ground may be used to prevent pigs from excavating beneath other fencing. Substandard conventional fencing can also be made temporarily usable until proper repairs are made by the addition of a single electric line set on a \"stand-off\" insulator.\nElectric materials are also used for the construction of temporary fencing, particularly to support the practice of managed intensive grazing (also known as rotational or \"strip\" grazing). It is also popular in some places for confining horses and pack animals overnight when trail riding, hunting, or at competitions such as endurance riding and competitive trail riding. Typically, one or more strands of wire, synthetic tape or cord are mounted on metal or plastic posts with stakes at the bottom, designed to be driven into the ground with the foot. For a hand-tightened temporary fence of electrified rope or web in a small area, these are usually spaced at no more than 12 to 15 feet (about four metres) to prevent the fencing material from sagging and touching the ground. Larger areas where tools are used to stretch wire may be able to set step-in posts at larger distances without risk that the fencing material will sag.\n\nWith temporary electric fencing, a large area can be fenced off in a short period. Temporary fencing that is intended to be left in place for several weeks or months may be given additional support by the use of steel T posts (which are quickly driven in with hand tools and unearthed with relative ease, using a leverage device), to help keep the fence upright, particularly at corners. Livestock owners using rotational grazing in set patterns that are similar from one year to the next, may permanently drive a few permanent wooden fence posts in strategic locations.\n\nPortable fence energizers are made for temporary fencing, powered solely by batteries, or by a battery kept charged by a small solar panel. Rapid laying-out and removal of multiple-strand temporary electric fencing over a large area may be done using a set of reels mounted on a tractor or all-terrain vehicle.\n\nFor sheep, poultry, and other smaller animals, plastic electric netting may be mounted on insulating stakes – this is also effective at keeping out some predators such as foxes.\n\nIn practice, once most animals have learned of the unpleasant consequences of touching the fence they tend to avoid it for considerable periods even when it is inactive. However, some animals learn to avoid the shock, either by running under the fence quickly between pulses, or by pushing other individuals through the fence. Animals with thick woolly coats (such as sheep or highland cattle) may learn to push through the fence themselves, using their coats as electrical insulation. Some animals also learn to recognize the slight clicking sound made by some electric fences and thus can sense when the fence is off.\n\nElectric fences are useful for controlling the movements of wild animals. Examples include deterring deer from entering private property, keeping animals off airport runways, keeping wild boar from raiding crops, and preventing geese from soiling areas used by people. Electric fencing has been extensively used in environmental situations reducing the conflict between elephants or other animals and humans in Africa and Asia.\n\nSecurity electric fences are electric fences constructed using specialised equipment and built for perimeter security as opposed to animal management. Security electric fences consist of wires that carry pulses of electric current to provide a non-lethal shock to deter potential intruders. Tampering with the fence also results in an alarm that is logged by the security electric fence energiser, and can also trigger a siren, strobe, or notifications to a control room or directly to the owner via email or phone.\n\nIn practical terms, security electric fences are a type of perimeter intrusion detection sensor array that acts as a (or part of a) physical barrier, a psychological deterrent to potential intruders, and as part of a security alarm system.\nNon-lethal electric fences are used by both private and government-sector bodies to prevent trespass. These include freight carriers, auto auctions, equipment rental companies, auto dealers, housing communities, commercial factories or warehouses, prisons, military bases, and government buildings. Many of these electric fences act as monitored security alarm systems in addition to causing an uncomfortable shock. Electrified palisade fences are used to protect isolated property and high security facilities, but also around some residential homes.\n\nThey can also be used inside a building, for example as a grid behind windows or skylights to prevent people from climbing through. They have even been used on yachts and on large ships to deter pirates.\n\nElectric fences are occasionally employed to discourage suicide attempts on tall structures, and to reduce the incidence of graffiti and other petty crime.\n\nDue to the high levels of crime in South Africa, it is common for residential houses to have perimeter defences. The City of Johannesburg promotes the use of palisade fencing rather than opaque, usually brick, walls as criminals cannot hide as easily behind the fence. In the City of Johannesburg manual on safety, one can read about best practices and maintenance of palisade fencing, such as not growing vegetation in front of palisades as this allows criminals to make an unseen breach.\n\nTypes of security electric fences include:\n\nA \"stun-lethal\" electric fence can be set to deliver a shock if touched once, and a fatal jolt if touched a second time. \n\n12-foot-high \"stun-lethal\" fences have been in use for some time in many US state prisons, like those in Arizona. The Federal Department of Corrections added them in 2005 to two prisons in Coleman, Florida, and prisons in Tucson; Terre Haute, Indiana; Hazelton, West Virginia; Pine Knot, Kentucky; and Pollock, Louisiana.\n\nA \"stun-lethal\" fence may also consist of two fences; one set of wires forming a conventional pulsed DC non-lethal fence, the second set (interleaved with the first) forming a 6.6kV AC lethal fence, energized when the DC fence detects an intruder. Alternatively it may consist of a single, AC or pulsed DC fence capable of running in \"safe\", \"unsafe\" or \"lethal\" modes by varying the DC pulse energy, AC/DC fence voltage and/or fence on-off duty cycle.\n\nElectric fences designed to carry potentially lethal currents can be used for anti-personnel purposes.\n\nIn 1915, during World War I, the German occupiers of Belgium closed off the border with neutral Netherlands, using a 300 km electric fence running from Vaals to Scheldt. Germany also erected a similar fence to isolate thirteen Alsatian villages from Switzerland.\n\nElectric fences were used to guard the concentration camps of Nazi Germany during World War II, where potentially lethal voltages and currents were employed, continuously rather than in pulses. Some prisoners used the electric barbed wire fence to commit suicide.\n\nDuring the Algerian War the French erected the electrified Morice Line.\n\nSections of the inner German border were lined with a 3 m (10 ft) high electric fence to deter potential defectors from East Germany. Similarly, the Czechoslovak border was lined with high electric fence during Cold War to prevent emigration from Czechoslovakia. \n\nElectric fences continue to be used in similar fashion at some high-security prisons and certain other installations to this day. Typically a nonelectric fence is constructed on either side of such an installation, or the deadly current is carried out of casual reach atop a wall.\n\nNorth Korea uses electric fences to seal off parts of its border with South Korea.\n\nRecent innovations include electrical fence monitoring for intruder detection as opposed to providing an electric shock to discourage entry. It can be used in addition to or as substitute for a host of other fence monitoring systems.\n\nBuried electric fences (also called \"invisible fences\" or \"electronic fences\") are sometimes used to contain dogs or livestock. The buried wire radiates a weak radio signal, which is detected by a collar worn by the animal. The collar emits a warning noise near the wire, but if this is ignored, produces a mild shock. Humans and other animals are unaware of the buried line. In a similar system, the collar uses GPS signals to determine proximity to a predetermined \"virtual fence\" without a physical installation.\n\nPoorly designed or badly maintained electric fences can create sufficient electromagnetic interference to cause problems for nearby telephone, radio, and television reception - and has been a particular problem for dial-up Internet users in some rural areas.\n\n\n"}

They also played a triangular ODI series against Australia and Sri Lanka. The first Test of the series, at Brisbane, was the 800th Test match to be played by England.\n\nThe first Test of the series began with what Wisden called \"one of the costliest decisions in Test history\", as England captain Nasser Hussain won the toss and chose to send Australia in to bat. Australia's batsmen took advantage of several dropped catches and other mistakes in the field to amass 364 for 2, with Ricky Ponting contributing 123 before being bowled by Ashley Giles, and Matthew Hayden finishing the day on 186 not out. England's woeful day in the field was capped by a severe injury to young bowler Simon Jones, who ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament while sliding to field a ball and was forced to withdraw from the tour.\n\nEngland fought back on the second day of the Test. Hayden advanced to 197 before gloving a catch to Wicket-keeper Alec Stewart, and the Australians' last eight wickets fell for just 128 runs despite 57 from Shane Warne. Giles added three more wickets to his total and Andy Caddick took three in the day, including the captain Steve Waugh for just 7. The England batsmen then began, Marcus Trescothick and Mark Butcher sharing an unbroken century partnership to take England to 158 for 1 at stumps.\n\nHowever, the Australians fought back on the third day. Butcher and Trescothick were both out early in the same over to Glenn McGrath. Hussain and John Crawley managed to stabilise the England innings and advanced to 268 for 3. However, England lost their last six wickets for 57 runs as the tail collapsed around Crawley, leaving him on 69 not out at the end of the innings. Australia started their second innings positively but lost both Justin Langer and Ponting to Caddick by the end of the day. A partnership between Hayden and Damien Martyn saw each advance to 40 not out by the close.\n\nAustralia advanced to a commanding lead on the fourth and final day, Hayden becoming only the fourth Australian to score a century in both innings of a Test match with his 103. Adam Gilchrist weighed in with 60 not out from 59 balls to take the Aussies to 296 for 5. Giles and Caddick were the only England bowlers to have any success: Giles taking the wickets of both Hayden and Ponting to finish with figures of 2 for 90 and Caddick taking 3 for 95. Waugh's declaration left England with a target of 464 runs for victory. However, England eventually finished with figures of 79 all out in 28 overs, with Mark Butcher the highest scorer at 40. Michael Vaughan departed LBW to McGrath on the third ball of the innings and Trescothick soon followed, caught at slip off Jason Gillespie. Brief partnerships between Hussain and Butcher, and then Butcher and Craig White were soon ended by McGrath (4 for 36) and Warne (3 for 29).\n\nThe second Test at Adelaide started much more positively for England, who had made several changes to their side, bringing in spinner Richard Dawson, Steve Harmison and Robert Key for the injured Ashley Giles, Simon Jones and John Crawley. Nasser Hussain won the toss and this time decided to bat, a decision that looked good as England advanced to 295 for 4 by the end of the day. However, this confident score was largely built around a massive 177 from Michael Vaughan, who was finally out to the last ball of the day, edging Andy Bichel to slip. No other England batsmen passed fifty, and Vaughan himself was lucky to escape dismissal on just 19 when he seemed to have been caught off Bichel by Justin Langer – TV replays proved inconclusive.\n\nAustralia took firm control of the match on the second day after a strong performance with both ball and bat. England crumbled from their strong overnight position to 342 all out, losing their last seven wickets for just 47 runs. Mark Butcher was caught behind off Jason Gillespie having added nothing to the overnight total, and England's tail was quickly dismissed by Gillespie (who finished with 4 for 78) and Warne (4 for 93). The English bowlers were next to suffer as the Australians advanced to 247 for 2 at stumps with Ricky Ponting undefeated overnight on 83. Matthew Hoggard and Andy Caddick were both smashed around the field and it was left to Craig White and Dawson to make the only breakthroughs in the afternoon, White having Matthew Hayden caught on 46 and Dawson striking to have Justin Langer caught behind on 48.\n\nThe situation worsened for England on the third day. Ponting and Damien Martyn batted through the morning session to take their overnight partnership for the third wicket to 242 before Martyn was caught off Harmison for 95 shortly after lunch, and Ponting went on to convert his overnight 83 into 154 before holing out to White. Darren Lehmann, Steve Waugh and Shane Warne fell quickly but expensively, Waugh making 34 runs from just 40 deliveries. A 77 run eighth-wicket partnership between Bichel and Adam Gilchrist off just 14 overs advanced the Aussies to a commanding 552 before Gilchrist was out miscuing a hook off Harmison and Waugh declared the innings. Needing 211 to avoid an innings defeat, England got off to a nightmare start as they collapsed to 36 for 3 by the close of play, losing Marcus Trescothick LBW to Gillespie for a duck, Butcher LBW to Glenn McGrath shortly afterwards and finally Hussain clean bowled by Bichel.\n\nEngland began the fourth day hoping for rain, but despite several short delays for weather the Aussies completed the innings victory with a day to spare. Key completed a disappointing Ashes debut as he was caught at mid-wicket off Bichel for 1 in the third over of the morning, and though Vaughan and Alec Stewart looked to stabilise the innings their partnership was broken when McGrath took an impressive catch to dismiss Vaughan off the bowling of Warne. Stewart, supported by a defensive Craig White, continued to make his 41st Test half century but the two fell in successive balls to leave England in hopeless circumstances. The tail fell to leave 159 all out, McGrath taking 4 for 41 and Warne 3 for 36, giving the Aussies a crushing victory by an innings and 51 runs.\n\n"}

He played for Fulham, Pécsi Mecsek and Harkány SE, as well as enjoying two spells at Ferencváros and West Bromwich Albion.\n\nGera is known for his overhead-kick goals and his cartwheel to back-flip celebration, which he demonstrated in Fulham's Europa League quarter-final win against Juventus in 2010. He was named Hungarian Player of the Year in 2002, 2004 and 2005. For his efforts in the 2009–10 season and his goals in the Europa League, Gera was named Fulham's Player of the Season.\n\nGera made his international debut for Hungary in 2002 against Switzerland, with his nation losing 2–1. In 2009, Gera briefly retired from the national team following a dispute with then-manager Erwin Koeman. When Koeman was replaced by Sándor Egervári in 2010, Gera returned to Hungary's international squad which he later represented at the 2016 UEFA European Championship. He announced his final retirement from football on 28 June 2018.\n\nGera started his professional career for Harkány SE in 1996, remaining there for one year before signing for Pécsi Mecsek FC.\n\nGera was signed by Pécsi Mecsek in 1997. During his three-year spell with the club, he made 87 appearances and scored 16 times. On 1 July 2000, Gera moved to major Hungarian side Ferencváros on a free transfer.\n\nDuring his four-year spell at Ferencváros, Gera played 115 league games and scored 32 goals. He won the Hungarian league title in 2001 and 2004, the Magyar Kupa in 2003 and 2004, and the Szuperkupa in 2004. He also received his first international call up while with the club.\n\nOn 30 July 2004, Gera moved to English Premier League club West Bromwich Albion for a fee of . He signed a three-year contract with Albion, with a further one-year option in the club's favour. He made his Premier League debut on 14 August 2004, replacing Andy Johnson in the 87th minute against Blackburn Rovers. The match ended in a 1–1 draw. Gera's first appearance in the starting lineup came on 25 August 2004 against Tottenham Hotspur. He scored his first league goal early in the third minute; that match also ended in a 1–1 draw.\n\nThe club struggled against relegation for most of the season, and Gera was portrayed by the media as an integral part of this struggle. Towards the end of the season, however, Gera's influence grew. He produced stirring performances, including a match-winning header against Everton on 3 April 2005. The club's form quickly improved, securing its continued Premier League status on the last day of the season. Gera scored six league goals in this his first season and was the only player at the club to appear in all 38 league matches. He was nominated in the end-of-season \"dream team\" by soccernet.com.\nDuring the 2005–06 season, Gera struggled with injuries and underwent a hernia operation in November 2005. At the end of the season, West Brom were relegated and Gera committed himself to the club. His performance in the club's 4–2 win against Charlton Athletic on 15 December 2007, scoring twice and setting up a third goal, earned him a place in the Championship Team of the Week. Gera helped Albion gain promotion in the 2007–08 season; on 9 June 2008, he decided to turn down a new contract offer from West Brom, choosing instead to join Fulham in the Premier League on a free transfer. The three-year contract was completed on 11 June 2008.\n\nGera made his Fulham debut in a 2–1 defeat to Hull City on the opening day of the 2008–09 Premier League. Minutes after coming off the bench, he scored Fulham's second goal in a 2–0 win against league leaders Manchester United. During the 2009–10 Premier League season, Gera scored his first goal of the season against West Ham United in a 2–2 draw. On 28 December 2009, Gera scored his second goal of the season at Stamford Bridge against Chelsea, when he hooked the ball over Petr Čech from 12 yards after four minutes. Despite this early goal, Fulham lost the game 2–1. Gera went on to score two goals in a man of the match performance against Juventus, Fulham winning 4–1. He scored the goal which sent Fulham to its first ever European final in a 2–1 victory against Hamburger SV; while Fulham lost the final 2–1, Gera did provide the sole goal's assist. Having scored ten goals in all competitions, Gera was voted the fans' player of the season for Fulham's 2009–10 season.\n\nGera started the 2010–11 season by scoring a hat-trick after coming off the bench in the 66th minute against Werder Bremen in a 5–1 friendly win, and a brace against Port Vale in the second round of the League Cup. His first league goal of the new campaign, a 30-yard volley which deflected off the post and then off the goalkeeper, came at The Hawthorns against former club West Brom. Despite this, Fulham manager Mark Hughes did not regularly start Gera, despite him being a fan favourite, instead using him sparingly as a substitute. Gera was sent off in Fulham's final match of the 2010–11 Premier League season on 22 May 2011, a 2–2 draw against Arsenal. This was the first red card Fulham had received all season and it nearly cost them a place in the Europa League through UEFA's Fair Play League, but Fulham finished ahead of closest challengers Blackpool by 0.01 points to win the qualifying berth.\n\nOn 16 June 2011, Fulham announced that Gera was available on a free transfer as one of three players that were being released by the club Subsequently, Gera looked to rejoin his former club West Brom.\n\nOn 2 August 2011, West Brom boss Roy Hodgson announced that the club had signed Gera on a two-year deal. On 5 November 2011, he made his second debut for West Brom as a starter in a 3–0 loss to Arsenal. After three first team appearances, Gera was injured in a 3–1 defeat against Tottenham Hotspur on 26 November 2011; he was unavailable for the remainder of the season. After nine months out due to his injury, Gera returned to the starting lineup against Liverpool on the first day of the 2012–13 Premier League season, opening the scoring with a volley from 25 yards, leading to a 3–0 win. On 8 January 2013, it was confirmed Gera would be out injured for the rest of the season after he injured a knee in a game against Queens Park Rangers. On 1 July 2013, Gera's contract with West Brom expired, making him a free agent for a short period until he signed a new contract for another year with the club. Gera left West Brom in 2014 after his contract expired.\n\nOn 2 April 2016, Gera became Hungarian League champion with Ferencváros after losing to Debreceni VSC 2–1 at the Nagyerdei Stadion in the 2015–16 Nemzeti Bajnokság I season.\n\nHe scored the only and winning goal in the 2016 Magyar Kupa Final on 7 May 2016 against archrival Újpest FC at the Groupama Arena.\n\nGera earned his first international cap for the Hungary national team on 13 February 2002 in a 2–1 defeat to Switzerland. Up to 2009, he had played 63 games for Hungary, scoring 18 goals. Before the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification match on 14 October 2009 against Denmark, Gera was excluded from the match squad by coach Erwin Koeman after he arrived late at a team meeting. Following the incident, Gera announced his retirement from the national team. On 23 July 2010, the newly appointed board of the Hungarian Football Federation terminated the contract of Koeman and appointed Sándor Egervári as the new national team coach. After a personal discussion with Egervári, Gera returned to the national team on 11 August 2010 against England.\n\nOn 29 March 2011, Gera scored twice against the Netherlands in the Amsterdam Arena in front of 51,700 spectators in a UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying match. He scored the first goal in the 50th minute and his second goal in the 75th minute. Gera's goals, however, were not enough as Hungary lost 5–3. On 7 September 2012, Hungary started their 2014 World Cup qualifying campaign with a 5–0 win in Andorra; Gera scored the second goal. On 16 October 2012, Hungary beat Turkey at home 3–1. Gera scored the third Hungarian goal.\n\nOn 31 May 2016, Gera was selected as vice-captain for the Hungarian squad for Euro 2016 in France. On 14 June, Gera played in the first group match in a 2–0 victory over Austria at the Nouveau Stade de Bordeaux in Hungary's first match of the tournament. Four days later, on 18 June, he played in a 1–1 draw against Iceland at the Stade Vélodrome, Marseille. On 22 June, he played in the last group match in a 3–3 draw against Portugal at the Parc Olympique Lyonnais, Lyon, and scored the first goal with a terrific half-volley from 25 yards out with his weaker foot. In so doing, he became the second-oldest goalscorer and the oldest goalscorer from open play at a European Championship, aged 37 years and 62 days; Austria's Ivica Vastić is the oldest scorer, at 38 years and 257 days, when he converted a penalty at Euro 2008. Gera's goal was later voted the \"Goal of the Tournament\" in a UEFA online fan poll.\n\nGera married on 19 June 2004; his wife gave birth to a boy named Szabolcs on 15 March 2008. Following the birth, he was given leave by his national team manager Péter Várhidi to miss Hungary's friendly against Slovenia to spend time with his family. In 2005, Gera featured in a television advertisement for Pepsi representing the 2006 World Cup, alongside Thierry Henry, David Beckham, Roberto Carlos, Ronaldinho, Nicklas Bendtner, Neil Ruddock and Raúl.\n\nGera is a member of the Faith Church and was featured in billboard advertisements promoting the organization. He has often defended the Church from its critics and promoted it several times in the media. He credits the Church with saving his life, helping him change his destructive lifestyle which included crime and drug abuse.\n\nFerencváros\n\nWest Bromwich Albion\n\nFulham\n\n\n"}

It is an archaeological site situated southwest of the city of Raqqa and the Euphrates.\n\nProcopius describes at length the ramparts and buildings erected there by Justinian. The walls of Resafa, which are still well preserved, are over 1600 feet in length and about 1000 feet in width; round or square towers were erected about every hundred feet; there are also ruins of a church with three apses.\n\nResafa corresponds to the Akkadian \"Raṣappa\" and the Biblical \"Rezeph\" (Septuagint; ), where it is mentioned in ; cuneiform sources give Rasaappa, Rasappa, and Rasapi .\n\nPtolemy calls it \"Rhesapha\" (). In the late Roman \"Tabula Peutingeriana\", it is called \"Risapa\". In the \"Notitia dignitatum\", it is \"Rosafa\".\n\nThe site dates to the 9th century BC, when a military camp was built by the Assyrians. During Roman times, it was a desert outpost fortified to defend against the Sasanian Empire and a station on the \"Strata Diocletiana\". It flourished as its location on the caravan routes linking Aleppo, Dura-Europos, and Palmyra was ideal. Resafa had no spring or running water, so it depended on large cisterns to capture the winter and spring rains. \nResafa was located in the area of the Roman–Persian Wars, and was therefore a well-defended city that had massive walls that surrounded it without a break. It also had a fortress.\n\nIn the 4th century, it became a pilgrimage town for Christians coming to venerate Saint Sergius, a Christian Roman soldier said to have been martyred in Resafa during the Diocletianic Persecution. A church was built to mark his grave, and the city was renamed Sergiopolis. Indeed, it became, after Jerusalem, \"most important pilgrimage center in Byzantine Oriens in [the] proto-Byzantine period\", with a special appeal to the local Arabs, especially the Ghassanids. By the late 6th century, the Ghassanids’ tribal Arab ally the Bahra’ were tasked with guarding Resafa and it’s shrine from nomadic marauders and the Lakhmids of Mesopotamia.\n\nThe city was lost by the Romans in the 7th century when the Arabs won the final victory at the Battle of Yarmouk in the year 636. In the eighth century, the Umayyad caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (r. 724–743) made the city his favoured residence, and built several palaces around it. The city was finally abandoned in the 13th century when the Mongols and Turks invaded the area.\n\nIn the Syrian Civil War, the town was occupied by ISIS, before being liberated by Government forces on 19 June 2017 during the Southern Raqqa Offensive.\n\nSebastopolis's first bishop was appointed shortly after 431 by John of Antioch, in spite of the opposition of the Metropolitan of Hierapolis Bambyce, on whom that church had till then depended. Later, Marianus attended a Council of Antioch.\nThe metropolis of Sergiopolis with five suffragan sees figures in the \"Notitia episcopatuum\" of Antioch in the sixth century. It had obtained this title from Emperor Anastasius I; at the fifth general council (Second Council of Constantinople) in 553, Abraham signed as Metropolitan. The favors of Anastasius obtained for the city the name of Anastasiopolis, which it still retained at the beginning of the seventh century. Bishop Candidus, at the time of the Sassanian Persian siege of the city by Khosrau I (in 543), ransomed 1,200 captives for two hundred pounds of gold, and, in 1093, Metropolitan Simeon restored the great Basilica (\"Échos d'Orient\", III, 238); which attests to the continuing existence of Christianity in Rasafa.\n\nThe (arch)diocese of Sergiopolis was nominally restored as a Roman Catholic titular bishopric, initially of the lowest (episcopal) rank, and under the curiate name Sergiopolis antea Resapha (having namesakes see Sergiopolis), and had the following incumbents as such:\n\nIn 1925, it was promoted to titular archbishopric of the highest, Metropolitan rank, and its name was shortened to Sergiopolis. As such, it has had the following incumbents, the first two however still only as titular bishop :\n\n"}

Born in Stirling, Ryan spent the majority of his professional career in England, starting with Manchester United before moving to Luton Town in 1970. In 1976, he moved to the United States, where he played for the Dallas Tornado in the North American Soccer League (NASL) and the Wichita Wings in the Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL).\n\nUpon his return to England in 1984, Ryan took over as manager of Luton Town's reserve team before taking charge of the senior team from January 1990 to May 1991. In June 1991, he was appointed by Alex Ferguson as the manager of Manchester United's reserve team, a position he held for 10 years. He was also the club's assistant manager for the 2001–02 season, before being made Director of Youth Football in 2002. He retired in June 2012, following 21 years on the Manchester United coaching staff. He is the father of former footballer and current manager of Manchester united U18s Neil Ryan.\n\nBorn in Stirling, Ryan started his career with Cowie Hearts. At the age of 17, he was spotted by a scout and invited for an initial two-week trial with English club Manchester United. The trial was extended to a month and Ryan signed as an apprentice with the club on 7 December 1962. A month later, he signed his first professional contract, but it was not until May 1966 that he made his first-team debut, playing on the right wing in the final four league games of the 1965–66 season. He scored his first goal in the third of those games, the third goal in a 6–1 home win over Aston Villa.\n\nHe played for Manchester United for four more seasons and was part of the team that won the 1966–67 Football League and 1967–68 European Cup. However, being in competition for a position with George Best (among others) meant that his appearances were limited and he left the club for Luton Town in 1970, along with Don Givens. In five seasons with Manchester United, he played 27 times and scored four goals. He played for Luton Town until 1976, when he left to play four seasons in the North American Soccer League with the Dallas Tornado. In 1979, the NASL players decided to strike for better pay, but Ryan was the only Tornado player to honour the strike. At the end of the 1979 season, Ryan moved to the Wichita Wings of the Major Indoor Soccer League where he finished his career with three indoor seasons.\n\nAfter living in the United States for eight years, Ryan returned to England to take over as manager of the Luton Town reserve team. Following Luton's dismissal of Ray Harford in 1990, Ryan was promoted for an 18-month spell as manager, saving the club from relegation on the last day of two successive seasons. However, he was sacked at the end of the 1990–91 season and replaced by David Pleat. About a month later, Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson invited Ryan to return to the club as reserve team manager. He held the position until 2000, when he was promoted to coach the first-team. After assistant manager Brian Kidd left to manage Blackburn Rovers in December 1998, Ryan stood in as Ferguson's assistant until Steve McClaren's appointment in February 1999, taking full charge of the side for their 3–2 defeat at home to Middlesbrough on 19 December 1998, which Ferguson missed in order to attend a funeral. Ryan was named as assistant manager again after McClaren left to manage Middlesbrough in 2001, but remained in the post for just one season until Carlos Queiroz took over.

{"id": "1920259", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1920259", "title": "Höllentalbahn (Black Forest)", "text": "Höllentalbahn (Black Forest)\n\nThe Höllentalbahn (literally, \"Hell Valley Railway\") is a railway line that partially runs through the Höllental valley in the Black Forest of Germany. The line connects Freiburg im Breisgau with Donaueschingen, a distance of . \n\nOver its entire course the line rises from an altitude of in Freiburg to in Hinterzarten. Part of the route has a 5.5% gradient, making the line one of the steepest in Germany.\n\nThe section Freiburg-Neustadt is electrified since 18 June 1936. Because of this and the steady decrease of traffic between Neustadt and Donaueschingen the route did not represent an operational unit anymore. The last direct connection between Freiburg and Donaueschingen ended in 2003 with the Kleber-Express being discontinued. Missing sections are supposed to be electrified until the end of 2019 in the course of the project “Breisgau-S-Bahn 2020” (Breisgau-tramway 2020), in order to enable direct trains from Breisach via Freiburg, Neustand and Donaueschingen to Villingen.\n\nThe line, which opened as far as Neustadt in 1887, was constructed for the Grand Duchy of Baden State Railways and was the last project of railway architect Robert Gerwig. The section of the line between Hirschsprung and Hinterzarten has a maximum gradient of 5.5%, and was initially operated as a rack railway on the Riggenbach system.\n\nThe line was extended from Neustadt to Donaueschingen in 1901. In 1932/33, ten powerful Class 85 steam locomotives were built, which enabled traffic to operate over the Hirschsprung and Hinterzarten section without rack assistance, and rack operation ceased in 1933.\n\nIn 1934, a new and partially tunnelled route within the city of Freiburg was opened. This enabled the original route, which passed closer to the city centre and over congested level crossings, to be closed.\n\nIn 1936, the Deutsche Reichsbahn electrified the line between Freiburg and Neustadt, installing a 20 kV, 50 Hz AC. This led to the subsequent adoption of the 25 kV AC 50 Hz system in France and elsewhere. Since the electrification of Mannheim–Karlsruhe–Basle railway had been completed in 1958, the \"Höllentalbahn\" was linked to the nationwide electric railway system. Therefore, in 1960, the electrified section of the \"Höllentalbahn\" was converted to the standard 15 kV, 16⅔ Hz system used throughout the German railway network.\n\nThe \"Höllentalbahn\" was used successfully to test designs for the DB Class 144. Later, electric motive power was supplied by the Series 145, which was itself replaced by the DB Class 139. Today, the electric line uses modern double-decker rolling stock pulled by DB Class 143 locomotives.\n\nThe stretch of line between Neustadt and Donaueschingen remains unelectrified.\n\nOn 14 December 1927 the old Ravenna bridge that crossed the Ravennaschlucht (Ravenna ravine), close to Hinterzarten, was replaced with a new viaduct, because it could not cope with the demand anymore. With the construction of the new viaduct, the railway section of the Höllentalbahn was straightened in that area. The costs were about 1,7 million Reichsmark, and only the abutments are still leftovers of the old bridge. The Ravenna tunnel which follows immediately after the bridge was originally 85 metres long. It was partially split open so that nowadays it only has a length of 47 metres.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1930s, the Höllentalbahn between Freiburg main station and Freiburg- Littenweiler was relocated, so that the station of Freiburg-Wiehre had to be moved as well. The relocation was made in order to avoid the intersection with the Rheintalbahn, to create a bridge instead and especially to get rid of the railroad crossings in the city area.[15]\n\nFurthermore, the intersection with the already existing line to Günterstal of the Freiburg im Breisgau tramway, which existed since 1901, could be discontinued. There was a severe accident on 12 October 1916 because a tram, which was heading into town, disregarded the closed barrier in the darkness and collided with a railroad train going uphill. The tram and the line-keepers lodge got shattered while the tram driver, the conductor and the only passenger got slightly injured.\n\nTwo new tunnels had to be built for the new line: the one going through the Lorettoberg and the one beneath the Sternwald. The eastern border fault of the Upper Rhine Plain goes through the Lorettoberg. It can be seen through a ‘window’, which has been left open whilst bricking the tunnel so the further subsidence can be measured. In the course of the construction works, the line from the central station to Wiehre was increased to two tracks. The former trainstation Alter Wiehre Bahnhof (Old Wiehre Station) is now used for cultural activities, for example as a building for film and literature with the ‘Kommunales Kino Freiburg’ (municipal cinema Freiburg), the 'Literaturbüro Freiburg' (lit.: literature office Freiburg) and it also houses a café.\n\nAfter leaving Freiburg Hauptbahnhof, the main station for the city of Freiburg, the Höllentalbahn diverges from the mainline Mannheim–Karlsruhe–Basel railway to the east. It the crosses over the mainline on a flyover and serves two further stops within the city, before starting its ascent of the Höllental.\n\nHigh points on the stretch of the line through the Höllental include the \"Hirschsprungfelsen\" (a rock formation) and a crossing of the Ravenna Gorge on the high Ravenna Bridge. The section of the line between Hirschsprung and Hinterzarten has a steep maximum gradient of 5.5%, betraying its origin as a rack railway.\n\nAfter leaving the Höllental, the Dreiseenbahn railway to Seebrugg diverges at the spa town of Titisee, close to the Titisee lake. The town of Neustadt follows, where electrification ends and through passengers normally need to change trains.\n\nFurther on, between Neustadt and Donaueschingen, the viaduct at the former crosses the Wutach at the beginning of its long gorge. While in a tunnel near Döggingen station, the line crosses a main European watershed, between the Rhine drainage basin (flowing into the North Sea) and the Danube drainage basin (flowing into the Black Sea).\n\nThe Höllentalbahn has 15 tunnels on its railway section. Nine of them are on the section between Freiburg and Neustadt (front section) and six of them are on the section between Neustadt and Donaueschingen (back section). The longest tunnel is the Dögginger Tunnel with a length of 535 metres. It passes beneath the European watershed between the Black Sea and the North Sea. All the tunnels on the back section between Neustadt and Donaueschingen were built with the building of the railway section; in contrast to the front section between Freiburg and Neustadt, where the Sternwald-Tunnel with a length of 514 metres and the Loretto-Tunnel with a length of 302 metres were built with the relocation of the railway section between Freiburg main station and Freiburg-Littenweiler in 1934. The lower Hirschsprung tunnel was originally 121 metres long but was then shortened to 114 metres after World War II.\n\n"}

Maxtla sent Chimalpopoca a present of women's clothing.\n\nTayatzin was killed, and Chimalpopoca decided to offer himself as a sacrifice at the altar of his father Huitzilíhuitl. \n\nWhen Maxtla laid siege to Tenochtitlan in 1428, Chimalpopoca's successor and uncle, Itzcoatl, repelled his forces with the aid of an alliance of city states, including Texcoco under Nezahualcoyotl and many former Tepanec allies, notably Tlacopan. These allied forces sacked Azcapotzalco and Maxtla was personally sacrificed by Nezahualcoyotl. \n\nThe victorious powers formalized their relationship in the Triple Alliance of Tenochtitlan, Texcoco and Tlacopan, which would become the basis of the Aztec Empire.\n"}

Zossen consists of several smaller municipalities, which were grouped together in 2003 to form the city.\n\nSince the 2003 municipal reform, Zossen consists of the following districts and municipalities:\nZossen, like most places in Brandenburg, was originally a Slavic settlement. Its name (Upper Sorbian: \"Sosny\") may derive from \"Sosna\" meaning pine, a tree quite common in the region.\n\nIn 1875, Zossen railway station opened on the railway line from Berlin to Dresden and the Prussian military railway to the artillery range at Kummersdorf-Gut in present-day Am Mellensee. Between 1901 and 1904, Zossen adopted the use of different high-speed vehicles, such as electric locomotives and trams, for transportation to and from Berlin-Marienfelde. These vehicles were powered by an alternating current of 15 kV and used a variable frequency. The power was transmitted by three vertical overhead lines.\n\nIn 1910, a proving ground and a garrison of the Imperial German Army was established at the Waldstadt section of the Wünsdorf community - surviving to the present day. In World War I it was the site of several prisoner-of-war camps, including the \"crescent camp\" (\"Halbmondlager\" for Muslims who had fought for the Triple Entente), where the first wooden mosque in Germany was erected. From 1939 to 1945, Wünsdorf hosted the underground headquarters of the German Wehrmacht (OKW) and Army's High Command (OKH). \n\nAfter World War II the area became the site of a Soviet military camp in East Germany known as \"Little Moscow\" or the \"Forbidden City\", the largest outside Russia, housing as many as 75,000 Soviet men, women and children with daily trains going to Moscow, until Soviet troops pulled out in August 1994. Since then it has returned to civilian use as the Wünsdorf-Waldstadt book town (founded in 1998), although much of it lies abandoned with evidence of Soviet occupation clearly visible. While new uses have not been found for the installations and bunkers of the military camp, they are somewhat maintained and there are various guided tours and museums. Some parts remain off-limits.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It has existed twice, first from 1959 to 1963, and then re-created in 2010. The district is mandated to return a single member to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta.\n\nThe current electoral district was created from a portion of Airdrie-Chestermere, Calgary-Hays and Calgary-Shaw. It contains the neighbourhoods of Auburn Bay, Cranston, Mahogany & Seton.\n\nThe first provincial electoral district to use the name Calgary South East was created in the 1959 redistribution that saw the provincial ridings of Calgary and Edmonton broken up. This marked the transition to standardize elections back to the First Past the Post across the province. From 1926 to 1959 Calgary and Edmonton, elected members with Single Transferable Vote in super districts while rest of the province used single member riding's using an Alternate voting method with a 50% margin.\n\nThe district was quickly abolished in the 1963 boundary redistribution when it became part of the Calgary South electoral district.\n\nA new electoral district was created in southeast Calgary in the 2010 boundary redistribution. The roots of the new district can be traced back to the old South East district through various changes to the electoral boundaries that have taken place since. The district was created primarily from Calgary-Hays and Calgary-Shaw and its boundaries were expanded into areas of the old Airdrie-Chestermere and Highwood electoral districts where the city of Calgary boundaries had expanded.\n\nThe first incarnation of Calgary South East saw Social Credit MLA Art Dixon win his third term in office with a landslide majority. He defeated two city of Calgary alderman to keep his seat in the Assembly. Dixon won the new district of Calgary South after South East was abolished in 1963.\n\nRecently the area that comprises the new Calgary-South East has returned Progressive Conservative candidates with large majorities and has done so since the 1970s. The incumbent for Calgary-Hays during the 2010 boundary shift was Art Johnston. He tried to run for renomination but was defeated by Progressive Conservative candidate Rick Fraser and won't stand for re-election.\n\nShortly after the Progressive Conservatives merged with Wildrose in 2017, Fraser announced he would sit as an independent. In January 2018 he announced he would run for the leadership of the Alberta Party, but has yet to inform the Speaker whether he intends to join the party caucus.\n\n"}

In the west, it borders on Lankwitz, part of the Steglitz-Zehlendorf borough. In the south, it is bounded by the Berlin city limits and the border with the state of Brandenburg.\n\nThe medieval \"Angerdorf\" arose together with neighbouring Mariendorf during the German \"Ostkolonisation\" migration about 1220 AD, then affiliated with the Teltow estates held by the Knights Templar commandry at Tempelhof. A fieldstone church was erected around 1240 which, still preserved, is one of the oldest in the Berlin area. \n\nThe settlement of \"Merghenvelde\" itself was first mentioned in a 1344 deed, after the Brandenburg lands of the Knights Templar had passed to the Order of Saint John. From 1435 onwards, the estates were held by the City of Berlin. Located in the southwestern suburbs of the Prussian capital, population increased from the mid-19th century on. The historic village centre was largely destroyed during the bombing of Berlin in World War II.\n\nTransportation and industry have played an important role in the development of Marienfelde: Since 1875 the Dresden Railway, a main North-South line entering Berlin, passes through Marienfelde. It is currently served by the Berlin S-Bahn commuter rail network at the Marienfelde, Buckower Chaussee and Schichauweg railway stations. The re-development as a long-distance track is planned.\n\nThe parallel Royal Prussian Military Railway (\"Königlich Preußische Militäreisenbahn\") passed through the Marienfelde area on its way from Berlin to the town of Zossen. Between 1901 and 1904, the track was electrified and used as test track for high-speed locomotive testing. Ten kilovolt, three-phase alternating current with a frequency of 50 hertz was transmitted over three overhead wires, strung one above the other. Experimental electrical locomotives reached speeds of up to on the track.\n\nNear the end of World War II, as part of the Elbe-Project, the world's first high-voltage direct current transmission lines were built from a power plant in Dessau, on the Elbe river, to Marienfelde. A substation was located in Marienfelde converted the direct current into alternating current. However, developments in the war prevented the project from ever becoming operational.\n\nToday, Marienfelde comprises several industrial parks such as the former Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft assembly plant opened in 1902, today operated by Daimler AG. Other main employers include IBM and Stollwerck; as well as branches of the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture, the Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety, and the Friedrich Loeffler Institute. \n\nMarienfelde is also known for a large refugee-processing center which operated during the Cold War. The center, which opened in 1953, was the first stop for more than 1.5 million refugees fleeing communism in East Germany via West Berlin. Refugees arriving in West Berlin were sent to the center where they received medical treatment, food, identification papers, and housing until they could be permanently re-settled in the West.\n\nEven after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the center continued processing East German refugees until unification a year later. Today the center remains in use, processing ethnic Germans who are immigrating to Germany from the former Soviet Union.\n\n"}
{"id": "1920297", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1920297", "title": "Rohilla", "text": "Rohilla\n\nRohillas are a community of Pashtun ancestry, historically found in Rohilkhand, a region in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India. It forms the largest Pashtun diaspora community in India, and has given its name to the Rohilkhand region. The Muslim Rohillas are identified as Pathans, where as the Hindu Rohillas regard themselves as Rajput.\n\nThe Rohillas are found all over Uttar Pradesh, but are more concentrated in the Rohilkhand regions of Bareilly and Moradabad divisions. Between 1838 and 1916, some Rohillas migrated to Guyana, Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago in the Caribbean region of the Americas. After the 1947 Partition of India, some of the Rohillas migrated to Karachi, Pakistan.\n\nThe term \"Rohilla\" is derived from the word \"Roh\", meaning \"mountain\". Roh was the homeland of the Pashtuns, in the southern foothills of the Hindu Kush. Historically the region of Roh has also been called \"Pashtunkhwa\" and \"Afghanistan\". Pashtuns especially the Mandarr Yousafzai tribe living in this valley were also known as Rohillas when they settled the area then known as Katehr. It later became known as Rohilkhand which means \"the land of the Rohillas\". A majority of Rohillas migrated from Pashtunistan to North India between the 17th and 18th century.\n\nThe founders of the Pashtun state of Rohilkhand were Daud Khan and his adopted son Ali Muhammad Khan. Daud Khan arrived in South Asia in 1705. He brought along a band of his tribe, the Barech. Daud Khan was awarded the \"Katehr\" region in the then northern India by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb (ruled 1658–1707) to suppress Rajput uprisings, which had afflicted this region. Originally, some 20,000 soldiers from various Pashtun tribes such as (Yusafzai, Ghori, Ghilzai, Barech, Marwat, Durrani, Tareen, Kakar, Naghar, Afridi, Bangash and Khattak) were hired by Mughals to provide mercenary soldier for the Mughal armies. This was appreciated by Aurangzeb and since this force of 25,000 men was given respected positions in the Mughal Army.\n\nDaud Khan was succeeded by Ali Muhammad Khan in 1721. He became so powerful that he refused to send tax revenues to the central government. Safdar Jang, the Nawab of Oudh, warned the Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah of the growing power of the Rohillas. This caused Mohammed Shah to send an expedition against him as a result of which he surrendered to imperial forces. He was taken to Delhi as a prisoner, but was later pardoned and appointed governor of Sirhind. Most of his soldiers has already settled in the Katehar region during Nadir Shah's invasion of northern India in 1739 increasing the Rohilla population in the area to 100,000. Due to the large settlement of Rohilla Pashtuns, this part Katehar region came to be known as Rohilkhand. Bareilly was made the capital of this newly formed Rohilkhand state.\n\nWhen Ali Muhammad Khan died, leaving six sons. However, two of his elder sons were in Afghanistan at the time of his death while the other four were too young to assume the leadership of Rohilkhand. As a result, power transferred to other Rohilla Sardars, the most important being Hafiz Rahmat Khan Barech, Najib-ud-Daula and Dundi Khan.\nAccording to the 1901 census of India, the total Pathan (Pashtun) population of Bareilly District was 40,779, while the total population was 1,090,117.\n\nIn the third battle of Panipat (1761) one of the Rohilla Sardars, Najib-ul-Daula, allied himself with Ahmad Shah Abdali against the Marathas. He not only provided 40,000 Rohilla troops but also 70 guns to the allied. He also convinced Shuja-ul-Daula, the Nawab of Oudh, to join Ahmad Shah Abdali's forces against the Marathas. In this battle, the Marathas were defeated and as a consequence the Rohilla increased in power.\n\nThe Marathas invaded Rohilkhand to retaliate against the Rohillas' participation in the Panipat war. The Marathas under the leadership of the Maratha ruler Mahadji Shinde entered the \"land\" of Sardar Najib-ud-Daula which was held by his son Zabita Khan after the sardar's death. Zabita Khan initially resisted the attack but was eventually defeated by the Marathas and forced to flee to the camp of Shuja-ud-Daula and his country was ravaged by Marathas. The Maratha ruler Mahadji Shinde captured the family of Zabita Khan, desecrated the grave of Najib ad-Dawlah and looted his fort. The principal remaining Rohilla Sardar was Hafiz Rahmat Khan Barech and through him an agreement was formed with the Nawab of Oudh, Shuja-ud-Daula, by which the Rohillas agreed to pay four million rupees in return for military help against the Marathas. However, after Oudh attacked the Rohillas, they refused to pay.\n\nLater Rohillas were attacked by the neighbouring kingdom of Oudh, who also received assistance from the British East India Company forces under Colonel Alexander Champion. This conflict is known as the Rohilla War. When Hafiz Rahmat Khan Barech was killed, in April 1774, Rohilla resistance crumbled, and Rohilkhand was annexed by the kingdom of Oudh. Rohillas fled into the dense forests across the Ganges, and later began a guerrilla war. In response, many Rohillas were hunted down by the troops of British East India company and subsequently scattered in the countryside. They settled in many small towns and cities. Charges of ethnic cleansing and genocide were brought against Warren Hastings of the East India Company, by Edmund Burke and were later taken up by Thomas Babington Macaulay.\n\nFrom 1774 to 1799, the region was administered by Khwaja Almas Khan, a Meo from Haryana, as representative of the Awadh(kingdom of Oudh) rulers. This period was particularly tough for the Rohillas, as Almas Khan made every effort to weaken the Rohillas. In 1799, British East India company annexed the territory, and started to pay a pension to the family of Hafiz Rahmat Khan Barech.\n\nWhile most of Rohilkhand was annexed, the Rohilla State of Rampur was established by Nawab Faizullah Khan on 7 October 1774 in the presence of British Commander Colonel Champion, and remained a pliant state under British protection thereafter. The first stone of the new Fort at Rampur was laid in 1775 by Nawab Faizullah Khan. The first Nawab proposed to rename the city \"Faizabad\", but many other places were known by that name so its name was changed to \"Mustafabad\".\n\nNawab Faizullah Khan ruled for 20 years. He was a patron of education and began the collection of Arabic, Persian, Turkish and Hindustani manuscripts which are now housed in the Rampur Raza Library. After his death his son Muhammad Ali Khan took over. He was assassinated by Rohilla elders after reigning for 24 days, and Muhammad Ali Khan's brother, Ghulam Muhammad Khan, was proclaimed Nawab. The East India Company took exception to this, and after a reign of just 3 months and 22 days Ghulam Muhammad Khan was besieged and defeated by English forces. East India company supported Muhammad Ali Khan's son, Ahmad Ali Khan, to be the new Nawab. He ruled for 44 years. He did not have any sons, so Muhammad Saeed Khan, son of Ghulam Muhammad Khan, took over as the new Nawab after his death. He established Courts and improved the economic conditions of farmers. His son Muhammad Yusuf Ali Khan took over after his death and his son, Kalb Ali Khan, became the new Nawab after his death in 1865.\n\nThe period between the revolt of 1857 and the independence of India in 1947 was a period of stability for the Rohilla community. In 1858, the British government issued a general pardon to all those who had taken part in the War of Independence and restored many lands. Some of the tribes were punished for aiding the rebels. Some tribes had to migrate to Delhi and Gurgaon, while others migrated to the Deccan region. Conditions improved after some years and migration from the North West Frontier Province and Afghanistan recommenced, adding to the Rohilla population. During this period, the Rohillas were also effected by the reformist movement of Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, with many taking to modern education. The founder of the Barelvi sect of Sunni Islam, Ahmad Raza Khan, was also born among the Rohillas and the city of Bareilly became an important centre of Islamic learning in Northern India.\n\nWhile a majority of Rohillas remained landowners and cultivators, a significant minority took to western education, and entered professions such as law and medicine. They also began to take an interest in the political debates during the last decade of the 19th Century. Some of them joined the newly formed Indian National Congress, while others were attracted to pan-Islamism. This period also saw a wholesale adoption of North Indian Muslim culture, with Urdu becoming the native language of the Rohilla. In fact the term of Rohilla was slowly replaced with the term \"Pathan\", which was a new self-identification. However a sense of distinct identity remained strong, with the Rohillas residing in distinct quarters of cities, such as, Kakar Tola, Pani Tola and Gali Nawaban in Bareilly, which was home to the descendants of Hafiz Rahmat Khan. There was intermarriages with neighbouring Muslim communities such as the Shaikh, Muslim Rajput and Kamboh. Thus at the dawn of independence, the Rohilla were losing their distinct community status.\n\nThe independence of Pakistan and India in 1947 had a profound effect on the Rohilla community. The vast majority of them emigrated to Pakistan in 1947. Those that were left in India, were affected by the abolishment of the zamindari system in 1949, as well as the ascension of the State of Rampur to India and many of them migrated to join their kinsmen in Karachi, Pakistan. The Rohilla now form two distinct communities with the majority in Pakistan and a small minority residing in India.\n\nThe Rohilla now form one of the larger Muslim communities of Uttar Pradesh and are found throughout Uttar Pradesh, with settlements in Rampur, Bareilly, Shahjahanpur in Rohilkhand being the densest. They now speak Hindustani in towns, and Khari boli in their rural settlements.\n\nThe Pathan (Rohilla) community of UP has sixteen sub-groups, the Ghilzai, Afridi, Barakzai, Barech, Daudzai, Marwat, Durrani, Naghar, Ghorghushti, Sur Pashtun, Kakar, Khalil, Mohmand, Mohammadzai, Orakzai, Yousafzai and Wazir, all of which are descended from well known Pashtun tribes. Some Rohilla Pathans reside in Maharashtra's Washim and Nanded district, Tehsil Kinwat Tribal Area. There is also a small population in Bendi and Kopra, two villages in Kinwat Taluka. In older parts of the Muslim areas of the towns in UP, the Pathans have maintained their own residential neighbourhoods. The Pathan are not an endogamous group, and arranged marriages do occur with other Sunni Muslim communities of similar social status, such as the Mughal tribe, Muslim Rajput and Shaikh although there is still a preference of marriage within the community.\n\nThe Rohilla have historically been landowners and soldiers, therefore, some parts of the community are associated with agriculture in Rohilkhand, while many Rohilla officers who worked in the British Indian Army in the 1940s migrated to Pakistan and joined the Pakistani Army; famous among them are General Rahimuddin Khan and General Akhtar Abdur Rahman. They have also been prominent in the Muslim religious sphere in UP, having produced many \"alims\" and \"Huffaz\" and have built and financed many Mosques and Madrassahs. In terms of formal education, they are seen as a community that has a favourable attitude towards western education, and many are professional doctors and lawyers.\n\nIn Pakistan, the Rohillas and other Urdu-speaking Pathans have now completely assimilated into larger Urdu speaking community. There is no sense of corporate identity among the descendants of Rohilla Pathans in Pakistan with high degree of intermarriage with other Muslims. They mainly live in Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur, and other urban areas of Sindh. Many have held high positions in the government, notably Sahibzada Yaqub Khan, a Rohilla, who was Pakistan's Minister of Foreign Affairs during the 1980s.\n\n\n"}

Its lineup is vocalist Mark Salomon, guitarist Greg Minier, bassist Jeff Bellew, and drummer Jim Chaffin. The Crucified released two studio albums and three demos. They toured California for the majority of their career and appeared at the Cornerstone Festival outside of Chicago several times. The band broke up in 1993 due to personal differences, but reunited in 2009.\n\nIn late 1984, drummer Jim Chaffin, guitarist Greg Minier, bassist Kirk Palmer, and vocalist Wayne Stonecipher started a band named K.G.B. in Fresno, California The four teens knew each other as high school classmates. The name K.G.B. had no meaning to it, the members just thought initials \"sounded cool\". In early 1985, K.G.B. was looking for a new vocalist due to the departure of Stonecipher. Minier asked his friend Mark Salomon to try out as vocalist.\n\nSalomon was accepted into the band after singing a few songs the band wrote with Stonecipher. Sensing pressure to have a meaning behind the name K.G.B., the band said the initials stood for Kids in God's Blessings. Not long after, the band thought the name sounded juvenile and changed it to The Crucified. The name came from Chaffin thinking of random names that would fit a Christian band. The Crucified added the Bible verse to the name whenever they wrote it. \"For I have been crucified with Christ, therefore I no longer live, but Christ lives in me.\"\n\nAfter almost a year of writing and practicing in the Palmer's living room, the guys recorded 10 songs on a demo tape under the name K.G.B., but it was never circulated. Soon after, Kirk Palmer left the band and was replaced by his brother Trevor. In 1986, The Crucified gathered together a small amount of money and recorded 15 songs on a tape named \"Take up Your Cross\" under their new name, The Crucified, and distributed the demo throughout their local area and via mail order. \"Nailed\", the band's second demo, was recorded the following year and the band's exposure continued to grow. Shortly after \"Nailed\" was recorded, the band members graduated from high school and Palmer left the group and was replaced by Mark Johnson. The band recorded \"Live at the New Order\" in March 1989.\n\nGreg Sostrom saw The Crucified at a few shows and offered them a recording contract with his new start-up label, Narrowpath Records. The band accepted the offer and started to record songs at Casbah Studios in Southern California. The 15-track album was titled \"The Crucified\". It was released in compact disc format, which was a new format in the late 1980s. After the album's release, the band started to tour around California, including appearances at the Cornerstone Festival as well as opening for D.R.I., G.B.H., and Pantera. Johnson was fired from the band due to personal differences and the guys started looking for a new bassist. Chaffin responded to an ad in a newspaper posted by Jeff Bellew, citing The Crucified as an influence. Bellew joined the band and drove for four hours from his home in So Cal to Fresno every weekend to practice. Eventually the drive became too costly, and he moved to Fresno to practice with the band.\n\nAfter recruiting Bellew, the band started to write and record for their second studio album, \"The Pillars of Humanity\". When the album was released 1991 on Ocean Records the band did not tour very much for the album. In 1992 the band was broken up, but 1993 is when the band announced their breakup. In 1995 the band reunited and played their final show at Cornerstone Festival.

Born in Edgworth, Lancashire, he played in The Football League for Bury and Manchester United at the turn of the 20th century. He also played twice for the England national team,\n\nBorn in Daisy Hill, Edgworth, Lancashire, Sagar was raised in Turton. He began his football career with Edgworth Rovers, making his debut for the club's reserve team at the age of 15, before a season with Turton St. Anne's in the Bolton Sunday School League led to him signing for Lancashire Combination side Turton Rovers in 1896 at the age of 18. After a two-goal performance for Turton Rovers against Bury Reserves, the Gigg Lane club signed Sagar in 1898. In a seven-year spell with Bury, Sagar scored 71 goals in 186 appearances, and finished as the club's top scorer from 1903 to 1905. He was also part of the Bury team that won the FA Cup in 1900 and 1903, scoring the second of six goals in the latter game – Bury's 6–0 win is still a record margin of victory in the FA Cup Final. During his time at Bury, Sagar played for The Football League XI four times.\n\nBury finished in 17th in the First Division in 1904–05, which would have seen them relegated had the league not chosen to expand the division from 18 teams to 20. Nevertheless, Sagar joined Manchester United in May 1905, and made his debut on the opening day of the 1905–06 season at home to Bristol City; Manchester United won 5–1, with Sagar scoring a hat-trick – only Wayne Rooney has since scored a hat-trick on his Manchester United debut. He scored another hat-trick in another 5–1 win against Barnsley later in the season on the way to a total of 20 goals in 23 appearances; only a knee injury prevented him from contributing further to the club's second-place finish in the Second Division and subsequent promotion. The injury worsened over the course of the following season, limiting Sagar to sporadic appearances and his eventual release at the end of the season; he managed only four goals in 10 appearances in 1906–07.\n\nAfter leaving Manchester United, Sagar joined Atherton of the Lancashire Combination First Division, but left for Second Division Haslingden after Atherton finished bottom of the league in 1909. The year after Sagar joined Haslingden, they scored 113 league goals, but it is unknown how many of these he contributed. They scored 98 goals the following year on the way to securing the Division Two title and promotion to Division One.\n\nSagar earned two caps for England. He made his debut on 17 March 1900 against Ireland in the 1899–1900 British Home Championship, and scored the second goal in a 2–0 win. His only other appearance came against Wales two years later.\n\nAfter retiring from football, Sagar set up a business in Bolton.\n\nBury\n\n"}
{"id": "1920311", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1920311", "title": "Cyriacus", "text": "Cyriacus\n\nCyriacus (fl. 303 AD), sometimes Anglicized as Cyriac, according to Christian tradition, is a Christian martyr who was killed in the persecution of Diocletian. He is one of twenty-seven saints, most of them martyrs, who bear this name, of whom only seven are honoured by a specific mention of their names in the Roman Martyrology.\n\nOf the Saint Cyriacus who, together with Saints Largus and Smaragdus and others (of whom Crescentianus, Memmia and Juliana are mentioned in the Roman Martyrology), is venerated on 8 August, all that is known with certainty, apart from their names and the fact of their martyrdom, is that they were buried at the seventh milestone of the Via Ostiensis on that date.\n\nHowever, legend has it that Cyriacus was a Roman nobleman who converted to Christianity as an adult and, renouncing his material wealth, gave it away to the poor. He spent the rest of his life ministering to the slaves who worked in the Baths of Diocletian. Under the reign of Western Roman Emperor Maximian, co-emperor with Diocletian, Cyriacus was tortured and put to death, beheaded in 303 on the Via Salaria, where he was subsequently buried. With him were martyred his companions Largus and Smaragdus, and twenty others, including Crescentianus, Sergius, Secundus, Alban, Victorianus, Faustinus, Felix, Sylvanus, and four women: Memmia, Juliana, Cyriacides, and Donata.\n\nSaint Cyriacus is credited with exorcizing demons from two girls. The first was Artemisia (or Artemia), the daughter of Emperor Diocletian, which resulted in both Artemisia and her mother Saint Serena converting to Christianity. The second was Jobias, the daughter of Shapur I of Persia (reigned 241-272), which led to the conversion of the King's entire household. But this is not possible because Shapur died thirty years before exorcism and because he had only one daughter named Adur-Anahid.\nIt is credible that it is, perhaps, either of the daughter of Narseh (293-302), or of the daughter of Hormizd II (302-309)d. It is more likely that many Bishops throughout the world (to this day) have been named in honor of Saint Cyriacus at the Baths (of Diocletian), including maybe the first so honored, Judas the Jew from Jerusalem, who converted and upon being named Bishop of Ancona took the name Cyriacus as his own in the latter part of the 4th century.\n\nThe Tridentine Calendar included the feast day of Cyriacus, Largus and Smaragdus on 8 August as a Semidouble. In 1955 this rank was lowered to that of Simple. The 1962 Calendar, issued together with Pope John XXIII's Roman Missal, the licit private and, under certain conditions, public use of which was authorized by the 2007 motu proprio \"Summorum Pontificum\", reduced their celebration to a Commemoration. They are not included in the 1970 reformed Calendar of the Roman Rite liturgy, which was issued under the authority of Pope Paul VI, but, being included, all three, together with Memmia, Juliana and Smaragdus, in the Roman Martyrology, they are recognized saints of the Roman Catholic Church.\nSaint Cyriacus is venerated as one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers.\n\nIt is claimed his relics were moved to Santa Maria in Via Lata in Rome, and the abbey of St Cyriaque in Altorf in Alsace.\n\nThe Church of \"Saint Cyriacus in the Baths of Diocletian\" (), was dedicated to this martyr, a former \"titulus\" church. The \"tituli\" were commonly named after their patron, often a lay patron in the early centuries: \"\"Cyriac\"\" in Greek signifies simply \"\"patron.\"\" This \"\"titulus,\"\" to which a cardinal was assigned, whatever its claimed second- or third-century origins, existed certainly in the fifth century, when Marcianus was cardinal priest of the title of S. Ciriaco alle Terme di Diocleziano in 494, at the time of Pope Gelasius I. The titulus was suppressed in 1477 by Pope Sixtus IV in favor of Saints Ciro and Giulitta. In 1493, Pope Alexander VI restored the name of S. Ciriaco. The title was definitively suppressed in 1587 by Pope Sixtus V, who assigned a titulus of Sts Quirico e Giulitta to Cardinal Ferdinando de' Medici.\nSt Cyriacus is the patron saint of the Italian city of Cirié.\n\nThere were monasteries dedicated to St Cyriacus in the now destroyed Arab village of Majdal Yaba in Israel and the existing village of Al-Fasayil near Jericho. The residents of both these villages venerated him during the Byzantine era.\n\nOn St Cyriacus' feast day, 8 August 1899, a category four hurricane made landfall on the island of Puerto Rico and was named after him. It was known as the Hurricane San Ciriaco.\n\n\n"}

As a player, he made more than 400 appearances in the Football League representing Exeter City, West Bromwich Albion, Manchester United, Stoke City, Coventry City and Charlton Athletic, and in the United Soccer Association with the Cleveland Stokers (Stoke City under another name). His favoured position was wing half. As manager, he took charge of Doncaster Rovers and (briefly) Sheffield Wednesday, and spent several years as assistant manager of the Republic of Ireland.\n\nSetters started his career with Exeter City making his debut towards the end of the 1953–54 season. He made ten appearances for the \"Grecians\" in 1954–55 and impressed enough to tempt First Division West Bromwich Albion to acquire his signature in the summer of 1955. Under the guidance of Vic Buckingham Setters became a regular as the \"Baggies\" finished in 4th in 1957–58 5th in 1958–59 and 4th again in 1959–60. \n\nSetters was included in England's 1958 FIFA World Cup squad as a reserve player, but did not travel to the tournament or play in any matches. \n\nIn January 1960, he was transferred to Manchester United for a fee of £30,000. Matt Busby signed Setters as a replacement for the injured Wilf McGuinness who had suffered a career ending leg break. Setters developed his reputation for being one of footballs 'hard men' and his combative style earned him the captaincy. A poor 1962–63 league campaign saw Manchester United nearly relegated in the Second Division but they did beat Leicester City 3–1 in the 1963 FA Cup Final. A much improved 1963–64 season brought a 2nd-place finish behind Liverpool. A 7–0 win over Aston Villa early in the 1964–65 season was Setters final game for Manchester United as he was sold to Stoke City for £30,000.\n\nHe played 19 times for Stoke in 1964–65 as Stoke claimed a mid-table finish of 11th position. At the end of the campaign, with the squad training for their pre-season in the United States Setters was involved in a 'bust-up' with teammate Calvin Palmer. Setters apologised to manager Tony Waddington and was allowed to travel to the United States but Palmer did not apologise and was forced to stay in England. Out in America, Setters played nine times for the Cleveland Stokers scoring three goals. He missed just three matches in 1965–66 playing in 45 fixtures. His run in the first team continued in 1966–67 until he sustained injury against Liverpool on 4 March 1967 which allowed Alan Bloor to take his place. After failing to dislodge Bloor, Setters joined Coventry City in November 1967. He made 59 appearances for Coventry in just under three years at Highfield Road and ended his career with a four-month spell with Second Division Charlton Athletic.\n\nSetters spent three and half years as Doncaster Rovers manager in the early 1970s before becoming Jack Charlton's assistant at Sheffield Wednesday in 1977. When Charlton resigned on 27 May 1983, Setters stayed on as caretaker manager for four weeks, although the club played no matches during this period. He later linked up with Jack Charlton again from 1986 to 1995 as assistant manager with the Republic of Ireland senior squad.\n\nSource:\n\n"}

When Williams said that he'd thought about writing a biography, Kreski struck up a partnership. The resulting book, \"Growing Up Brady: I Was A Teenage Greg\" sold more than 300,000 copies and established Kreski as an \"as told to\" celebrity writer. Kreski went on to co-write three best-selling autobiographies with William Shatner, and one with baseball pitcher David Wells.\n\nKreski was associated with MTV Networks for over 15 years, and was a writer and consultant for many of its high-profile series and specials, such as \"Remote Control\", \"Beavis and Butt-Head\", \"Celebrity Deathmatch,\" and the channel's annual movie and video music awards shows.
