{"id": "2294782", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2294782", "title": "Confide in Me", "text": "Confide in Me\n\n\"Confide in Me\" is a song recorded by Australian singer Kylie Minogue, taken from her fifth, self-titled studio album (1994). It was released as the album's lead single on 29 August 1994, by Deconstruction, Imago, and Mushroom Records. The track was written by Steve Anderson, Dave Seaman, and Owain Barton, whilst production was handled by British trio Brothers in Rhythm. It was recorded in London, United Kingdom at DMC and Sarm West Studios during 1994. Musically, it is a pop song that incorporates elements of indie music, trip hop, and Middle Eastern instrumentation such as strings and percussion, whilst the lyrical content talks about Minogue's earnest of seduction and manipulating people to confide into her.\n\nUpon its release, \"Confide in Me\" received critical acclaim from music critics. Several critics selected the track as a standout from many of her records and compilation, whilst individual reviews commended Minogue's vocals, the production and influence of Middle Eastern elements. The track received nominations at some award ceremonies, along with being listed on critic's year-end lists. Commercially, the track experienced success in regions like Australia, United Kingdom, Scotland, Ireland, France, and New Zealand. It also became Minogue's only charting single in the US during the 1990s period, having peaked at 39 on the US \"Billboard\" Dance Club Songs chart.\n\nAn accompanying music video was directed by Paul Boyd in Los Angeles, California during July 1994; it featured six different videos of Minogue in a commercial to help the audience confide their numerous problems to each character. The song has been performed on several of Minogue's concerts, and most recently on her 2019 Summer Tour. \"Confide in Me\" has been noted by critics and publications as one of the most iconic and innovative singles from the 1990s era, and Minogue's singles history, and has been recognised by authors as an important period of Minogue's career and musical \"re-inventions\". Alongside this, it has been sampled and covered by musicians, and used in several media.\n\nAfter Minogue's previous single release, her cover version of the Kool and the Gang's track \"Celebration\" with the record label PWL, she left them and signed a contract to United Kingdom dance label Deconstruction Records in 1993. During the time of her final singles with PWL, she felt that her producers, the British trio Stock, Aitken, and Waterman were treating her \"very much [like] a puppet in the beginning. I was blinkered by my record company. I was unable to look left or right\". \"Confide in Me\" was written by Steve Anderson, Dave Seaman, and Owain Barton, whilst production was handled by British trio Brothers in Rhythm, whom the former two writers are members of.\n\nAccording to British author Sean Smith, who wrote a biography detailing Minogue's career, Brothers in Rhythm had developed a demo version of the song in just under an hour, and Minogue has been travelling to her Chelsea, London home. Minogue was contacted by the members of Brothers in Rhythm to record the track, so she went to their homebase to record the track in one take. Seaman was surprised with the development process, stating to Smith; \"It just all kind of flowed out and slotted into place, which is usually the case with the good stuff\". Anderson was impressed with the demo that he decided to use it as the final recording; he commented \"Obviously, there were embellishments to it and we spent a lot of time on the whole production, but it was still the original one that we were using\". However, some additional vocals by Minogue were recorded at DMC and Sarm West Studios in London, United Kingdom, and was mixed in the same locations by Niall Flynn and Paul West.\n\nBrothers in Rhythm were \"well aware\" of a crossover dynamic between pop and dance music at the time, noting that Minogue's vocals and \"willingness to experiment with music\" made them able to \"push the envelope\" further. Brothers in Rhythm composed the track, and is a pop song that incorporates elements of indie music, dance-pop, and Middle Eastern instrumentation such as strings and percussion. The opening part of the track, which lasts 50 seconds, were from the original demo of the track, and features an orchestral arrangement from musician Will Malone and a piano section by Anderson, which was performed using a Bösendorfer. The opening section also features a violin solo by Gavyn Wright, where Anderson and Wright commented that the inclusion was merely an \"improvisation\" to further help the record's sound. During the song's opening and bridge section, a gated didgeridoo is played by Anderson.\n\nAccording to Jason Lipshutz, writing for the American magazine \"Billboard\", \"'Confide in Me' continued Minogue on her path away from simplistic pop atop a swath of strings and Middle Eastern influences. The deadpanned bridge -- \"Stick or twist, the choice is yours/Hit or miss, what's mine is yours\"—is delivered in a murmur that yearns for a \"Serious Artiste\" label\". Jude Rogers from \"The Guardian\" gave it a similar review, \"before it pivots off the hook of an early-80s cult classic (the melody of Jane and Barton's It's a Fine Day, already revisited a few years earlier on Opus III's rave-era hit)\". She also noted that the track samples from the 1974 Jimmy Smith jazz cover of Barry White's \"I'm Gonna Love You Just a Little More Baby.\" Similarly, Nick Levine from Digital Spy labelled it \"Middle Eastern pop\", with elements of \"string-swathed dance-pop\". Larry Flick labelled the sound as \"atmosphere\", and believed it was influenced by downtempo music.\n\nLyrically, the content talks about Minogue's earnest of seduction and manipulating people to confide into her. The message in the lyrics is that it is she who manipulates the situation between her and someone by saying \"I can keep a secret/and throw away the key\"; it also represents the respect as the \"power remains hers\". It later explains that, in the bridge part where she sings \"Stick or twist/The choice is yours\", she teasers her lover that they hold the key to power. According to William Baker, whom had written a biography with Minogue detailing her career and life, he says that the song \"symbolizes internal power struggle that rages beneath her [Kylie's] surface\" as he continues \"she is both puppet and puppet master\".\n\n\"Confide in Me\" was released as the album's lead single on 29 August 1994, and was her first single to be distributed by Deconstruction; Imago Records, and Mushroom also released it as a CD single, cassette tape and 12\" and 7\" vinyl. Two CD sets were released in the UK and Australia; the first CD featured the master mix, plus two remixes of the track, whilst the second CD featured the extended mix and two B-sides titled \"Nothing Can Stop Us\", originally from Saint Etienne, and \"If You Don't Love Me\", originally from Prefab Sprout. The European CD single featured the master mix and The Truth remix, whilst the US maxi CD included the radio edit, plus two remixes of the song and a remix of her song \"Where Has the Love Gone?\". Two vinyl sets were published in the UK and US, and the UK and Australia; the first featured the master mix and two remixes, whilst the latter spawned three remixes of \"Confide in Me\" and two remixes of \"Where Has the Love Gone?\". Released in the UK, a special 7\" jukebox vinyl included two remixes, whilst two cassettes were distributed in the US and Australia respectively. In 2003, to promote Minogue's success with her album's \"Fever\" (2001) and \"Body Language\" in Asia, a promotional disc with five remixes of the single was issued in Japan and Israel, whilst a limited edition 12\" vinyl was released in the UK to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the release.\n\n\"Confide in Me\" received critical acclaim from music critics. Sean Smith labelled the track a \"classic\" to Minogue's discography, as similar to how William Baker viewed it. Mike Wass from \"Idolator\" wrote that \"the Brothers In Rhythm-produced gem was the stepping stone that took her from the glorious pop of \"Better The Devil You Know\" to collaborating with Nick Cave on \"Where The Wild Roses Grow\".\" He added that it was \"a vehicle to showcase a then-hugely-underrated voice.\" Quentin Harrison from PopMatters highlighted the track from the parent album, and said \"Minogue's international perspective lent her canvas precision, not iciness as witnessed with 'Confide in Me'. The cut played like a lost spy film accompaniment, its grandiose strings and rumbling groove enthralled. 'Confide in Me' let Minogue become the vocalist cynics sneered she'd never be ...\". Nick Levine from Digital Spy selected the track as the standout, and commented \"How can we plump for anything other than 'Confide in Me'? Fifteen years on, this sumptuous, string-swathed dance-pop epic still caresses the ears like a flirty hair stylist.\" British author and critic Adrian Denning enjoyed the track and called it \"truly timeless and absolutely wonderful.\" He declared the track \"Arguably still her finest musical moment to this date,\" and found the production and lyrical delivery \"classy\". \"Billboard\"s Jason Lipshutz wrote of the track:\n\nDeeply flirtatious and as knowingly dramatic as a James Bond theme song, \"Confide in Me\" continued Minogue on her path away from simplistic pop atop a swath of strings and Middle Eastern influences. The deadpanned bridge -- \"Stick or twist, the choice is yours/Hit or miss, what's mine is yours\" -- is delivered in a murmur that yearns for a \"Serious Artiste\" label.\n\nChris True at AllMusic described the song as \"slicker, more stylish, and less hooky than anything she had previously recorded.\" He also highlighted the track as one of the album standouts. Similarly, Marc Andrews from \"DNA Magazine\" reviewed the remastered vinyl of the parent album and pointed it as the best track on the album. Mike Wass from Idolator said \"the Australian diva switched labels and reemerged with a haunting Brothers in Rhythm-produced indie-pop anthem that still seethes and seduces 20 years later.\" Writing for the \"Herald Sun\", Cameron Adams placed it at number two on his list of the singer's best songs, in honor of her 50th birthday, calling it: \"THE one that changed everything – where Kylie became instantly cool [...] a lush, six-minute experimental epic with middle eastern vibes and modern dance beats, it automatically drew a line in the sand to reboot Kylie\". Stephen Meade from \"The Network Forty\" described it as a \"haunting dance-friendly sound\". A negative review came from \"Hot Press\" editor Craig Fitzsimons; he criticized the \"boring\" production, saying \"'Confide in Me' is exactly what you would expect; a boring, nothingy post-Stock Aiken Waterman piece of dance fluff enlivened only by Kylie's breathy exhortations to \"Stick or twist/The choice is yours/Hit or miss/What's mine is yours.\"\n\nCommercially, the track experienced success in regions like Australia, United Kingdom, Scotland, Ireland, France, Finland, and New Zealand. It debuted at number 31 on the Australian Singles Chart, but went straight to number one the following week, marking it one of the highest jumps for a single in Australian chart history. It became Minogue's first Australian number one single since her 1988 track \"Got to Be Certain\", and remained at number one for four weeks. It stayed inside the top 10 for nine weeks, and eventually spent a total of 25 weeks in the top 100. It debuted at number two on the UK Singles Chart, having been stalled by Wet Wet Wet's Love is All Around (in its last of 15 weeks at number one), and lasted a total of 14 weeks inside the top 100 chart. It was certified Silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipments of 200,000 units, and sold 183,000 units by March 2014. The single peaked at number three on the Finnish Singles Chart, but failed to enter the top ten in Ireland, peaking at number 12 during September 1994.\n\nIn New Zealand, \"Confide in Me\" debuted and peaked at number 12, which was her first charting single since 1990's \"Step Back in Time\". It lasted four non-consecutive weeks inside the top 20, and stayed in the chart for nine weeks overall. The song was success on the French Singles Chart, peaking at number ten during its 13th week, and lasted a total charting span of 18 weeks. In Switzerland, it reached number 20 in its third week and lasted 8 weeks inside the top 100 chart. It stayed inside the German Singles Chart for 7 weeks, peaking at number 50, one of Minogue's lowest charting singles in that region. Elsewhere, it reached the top 40 in regions like the Netherlands' Dutch Top 40 chart, Belgium's region of Flanders, and in Sweden. The song was released by Imago Records in North America, and managed to chart on the US \"Billboard\" Dance Club Songs chart at number 39, staying in there for six weeks; this was Minogue's first and only charting single in the US during the 1990s period.\n\nAn accompanying music video was directed by Paul Boyd in Los Angeles, California during July 1994. According to William Baker, the video \"presents Kylie as a kaleidoscope of female stereotypes that at first suggest her to be a plastic commodity. This notion is overturned by the lyrical content that reveals, contrarily, a multi-dimensional character who actually empowers\". Minogue had shot the video just before working on the 1994 action-film \"Street Fighter\", which she already had a tight schedule at the time due to promoting the singles release in the US, South East Asia, and in Australia. The video opens with a hand print, with the title underneath saying 'Touch the screen'; it hovers to the right, and six screens are divided into different \"stereotypes\" of Minogue; one with army-esque material, a rainbow background, drugs, blood splatter, a \"love heart\" candy with the words \"Call me\" on it, and the final with an egg.\n\nDuring the entire video, several title screens appear that feature seductive phrases as similar to an advertisement commercial, including \"Call me\", \"Call now\", and a fake phone number for the audience to call; some title screens are written in different languages including French, German, Italian and Spanish. As the first verse starts, each individual Minogue clone sings the track in their respective areas. The video ends with all six figures walking off their sets, with the fake phone number at the bottom of the video.\n\nSean Smith noted that the each Kylie was \"slightly sinister and contained no cute skipping and jumping\". Editors from Out.com highlighted the video amongst some of her best work. In an extended analysis, Bence Illés from Pop-Cultured said \"The music videos accompanying the album were also Kylie's most colourful and provocative videos to date. 'Confide in Me' presented Minogue singing in front of six different colourful paintings symbolising murder, war and peace, sexuality, and drug use (as a nod to the 90s clubbing culture). The video also featured the singer as a femme fatale, as well as a cute girl, reminiscent to her career beginnings.\" Lewis Corner from Digital Spy listed it as one of Minogue's most surprising transformations, and also on a similar list by Simon Duke at Chronicle Live. The video placed third in the vote for Best Video at the 1994 Smash Hits Poll Winners Party.\n\nAs part of both single and album promotion, Minogue performed \"Confide in Me\" on some TV shows such as \"Hey Hey It's Saturday\" in Australia and \"Top of the Pops\" in the United Kingdom. \"Confide in Me\" has been performed on several concert tours by Minogue. It was first performed on her 1998 Intimate and Live tour, where it appeared in the fifth section. It was also performed in her fifth segment of the On a Night Like This Tour, following a performance of \"Butterfly\". The song was included in the Streetstyle section of her KylieFever2002 tour, where Minogue portrayed a police officer who, throughout this section, mixes with the kids on the street. The song was included on the 2005 , during which a male dancer in eveningwear pursues the singer through gas-lit streets, until the pair engage in a ballroom dancing. Minogue was unable to complete the tour as she was diagnosed with early breast cancer and had to cancel the Australian leg of the tour. After undergoing treatment and recovery, she resumed the concert tour in the form of in 2006, and \"Confide in Me\" was again added to the set list, with dancers manipulating her like a puppet during the performance.\n\nMinogue included \"Confide in Me\" on the setlist of her 2009 For You, for Me tour, which was her first time touring in North America. As part of \"Aphrodite\" album promotion in 2010, Minogue performed a concert for BBC Radio 2 Acoustic Live Sessions, in which she sang an acoustic version of \"Confide in Me\", accompanied by a full orchestra band. The song was performed again on the 2011 , where it opened the fifth section; Minogue wears a \"Bacofoil ball gown\" to perform the song. At the London stop of Hurts's Happiness Tour, on 4 November 2011, Minogue joined duo band to perform a duet of \"Confide in Me\". On the Kiss Me Once Tour in 2014, an a cappella portion of the song was performed on selected concerts, during the fan request moment. Minogue performed \"Confide in Me\" on A Kylie Christmas concert series in 2016, on act two, between \"Come into My World\" and \"The One\", performed as a duet with musician John Grant. The song was also included on the Golden Tour (2018–19); dressed in a white suit, Minogue performed an acoustic guitar-driven version of the song, which was described as \"brooding\" and \"yearning\" by some critics. Writing for News.com.au, Nick Bond felt the singer \"somehow managed to ratchet up the song’s drama more than previously possible\". It was also included on the setlist of the Summer 2019 tour, being performed with Minogue stood with her dancers collapsed around her feet, \"looking like Delacroix's \"Liberty Leading the People\"\" according to \"NME\"s Dan Stubbs.\n\n\"Confide in Me\" has been sampled and covered by several different musicians since its release. British rock band The Sisters of Mercy recorded a cover version of the song for their cover album \"The Good, The Bad & The Ugly\" (2002). Croatian rock band Analena covered the single, and their version appeared as a B-side to their single \"Arhythmetics\" in 2000. Similarly, a cover version by Australian artist Ben Lee appeared on his extended play \"The Dirty Little Secrets\" in 2002. In 2006, another cover was added to Angtoria's album \"God Has a Plan for Us All\", whilst British singer Nerina Pallot recorded her version for her single \"Sophia\". British duo Hurts performed a live version of the song, whilst Australian bands The Cat Empire and Tame Impala recorded their versions as stand-alone recordings.\n\nBritish rapper Example sampled the track for his own song \"No Sleep for the Wicked\", whilst Australian artist Missy Higgins recorded it for her fourth studio album \"Oz\" (2014). The single was performed on the Australia Broadway show Priscilla, Queen of the Desert in 2007. \"Confide in Me\" has appeared on numerous greatest hits compilation albums conducted by Minogue, including the titular compilation album (2001), \"Ultimate Kylie\" (2004), \"The Best of Kylie Minogue\" (2012) and \"\" (2019). Some compilations, such as \"Ultimate Kylie\" and \"The Best of Kylie Minogue\" (2012) feature altered versions of the single, whilst the Phillip Damien Mix has appeared on her remix album \"Essential Mixes\" (2010). However, the compilation albums \"\" (2007) and \"Confide in Me\" (2016 edition) are exactly the same album releases but distributed in two different years, meaning \"Confide in Me\" has been used in two same album releases. In 2018, a cover of the song was used throughout the marketing for the Foxtel miniseries, \"Picnic at Hanging Rock\".\n\nSince its release, \"Confide in Me\" has been noted by critics and publications as one of the most iconic and innovative singles from the 1990s era, and Minogue's singles history, and has been recognised by authors as an important period of Minogue's career and musical \"re-inventions\". According to Lee Barron, who wrote the book \"Social Theory in Popular Culture\", he felt the image of the music video was an example and opening of \"Indie Kylie\"; an image that later progressed through the work of her 1997 album \"Impossible Princess\". Jude Rogers from \"The Guardian\" listed the track on her \"10 of the Best Kylie Minogue Songs\" in June 2016; Rogers complimented the production and said \"The effect is utterly mesmerising, and Kylie is in total control from the off, telling you she \"can keep a secret / And throw away the key\". Later she turns the middle eight into a particularly pervy-sounding card game (\"Stick or twist / The choice is yours\"), and also plays with the idea of her fame (\"Hit or miss / The choice is yours\").\" She also said the track was her \"greatest, strangest hit\". Brittany Porter from AXS.com listed the lyric \"'I stand in the distance/I I view from afar/Should I offer some assistance/Should it matter who you are?'\" as some of her best lyrical performances to date.\n\nNick Levine from Digital Spy labelled it one of her most standout singles to date. Louis Virtel, writing for the website NewNowNext.com, hosted by Logo TV, listed it as her third best track from 48 selected songs; he compared it to the work of Irish singer Sinéad O'Connor and said \"Demanding intimacy is a Kylie strong suit, and her performance on this gently prodding, yet desperately longing track is so lovely and vulnerable ... Kylie's comfort in provocatively challenging a lover to be more honest is one of her greatest audio moments.\" Jason Lipshutz from \"Billboard\" listed it amongst nine other tracks on his \"Kylie Minogue Primer: The Top 10 Past Hits You Need To Know\" list. Zac Bayly from \"Oyster Magazine\" called it his favourite Minogue track. Stephen from Homorazzi.com listed it at number 7 on his \"Top 10's: Top 10 Kylie Songs of All Time\", stating \"'Confide in Me' actually grew on me as time wore on. My first exposure to it was in her Greatest Hits album and it wasn't a track I paid much attention to, but in time it's grown into one of my favourites.\" On the American website AllMusic, it has been selected as a highlight numerous times from her albums: \"Confide in Me\", \"Hits+\", \"Greatest Hits 87–97\", and \"Greatest Hits 87–99\".\n\n\nNote: The Phillip Damien mixes were released exclusively in the US for promotional purposes only. The \"Bass Change Mix\" was later added to the commercial release of Put Yourself in My Place under the name \"Phillip Damien Mix\". Otherwise, they are identical.\n\nCredits adapted from the CD liner notes of \"Kylie Minogue\":\n\n\n\n"}

He was baptized Catholic and named Joseph, and was fluent in Mohawk and French. In 1860, he entered the Petit Séminaire de Montréal where he studied for the priesthood for about four years. He returned to Oka and joined the local Sulpician seminary as secretary.\n\nOn July 25, 1868, Onasakenrat was elected chief of the Mohawk community. Almost immediately, he travelled to Ottawa to meet with the Superintendent of Indian Affairs. Onasakenrat petitioned the government to return land to the Mohawks which was, at the time, held by the Sulpicians. The Mohawk had learned that the Sulpicians had changed the terms of an earlier land grant deed and, rather than holding the land in trust for the Mohawk, had taken control of it. They were already selling it off to settlers.\n\nOnasakenrat accused the seminary of exploiting the natives and of intentionally keeping them impoverished. The seminary threatened to excommunicate anyone involved in the petition, prompting Onasakenrat, along with most of the Mohawk community, to leave the Catholic Church that winter and convert to Methodism.\n\nOn February 18, 1869, the chief confronted the Sulpicians again, challenging their authority over the land by cutting down a large elm tree without permission. One week later, backed by an armed band of forty men, Onasakenrat demanded that the Sulpicians leave Oka within eight days. The priests refused to leave, and instead obtained a warrant for his arrest. Montréal police arrived and arrested the group, although they were released a few days later.\n\nIn 1877, Onasakenrat was charged after the Catholic Church in Oka was destroyed by fire in the early morning of June 14. At the time, the Mohawk were engaged in a dispute with white Canadian settlers over logging rights on their reserve. A group of Protestant Mohawks were accused of starting the fire. The group was tried quickly, and found not guilty by a jury.\n\nA devoutly religious man, Onasakenrat became an ordained Methodist minister in 1880, and worked to translate religious works into the Mohawk language. He translated the Gospels (1880) and several hymns. At the time of his sudden death in 1881, he was working on a translation of the remainder of the Bible, having completed up to the Epistle to the Hebrews. \n\nAn oral account tells that the night before he died, he had attended a ball in Montreal hosted by the Sulpician order. When he returned home the next day, Sosé had complained to his wife about feeling ill and died later that morning. A priest was said to come that morning with a horse and sleigh, and took the chief's remains back to Montreal with him. Many Kanehsatà:kehro'non believe that the Sulpicians had poisoned and murdered Onasakenrat because of the political and religious influence he had over his people.\n\n"}

The film tells the story of a gas-station attendant with a bad attitude who finds life more exciting after he is allowed to hang out with a chapter of the Hells Angels outlaw motorcycle club.\n\nThe Angels first take note of \"Poet\" (Jack Nicholson) after one of them inadvertently damages his motorcycle and breaks its headlight. Poet, with far more guts than brains, challenges the Angel that hit his motorcycle. This is an act that would traditionally result in every Angel present participating in a group beating of the attacker. \"When a non-Angel hits an Angel, all Angels retaliate.\" But the leader of the Angels, Buddy (Adam Roarke), intervenes and tells Poet that the Angels will replace the headlight. In the meantime, he's welcome to ride with them while they take care of business—which turns out to be going to a bar and beating up the members of another club who previously beat an Angel.\n\nPoet is told to wait outside, but ends up helping the Angels. Later that night, the Angels return the favor by hunting down and beating four sailors who beat Poet four-against-one after he parted company with the group. Poet accidentally bumps into one of the sailors and speaks rudely to him before he realizes that the sailor has three other sailors with him. The four sailors then refuse to accept his apology—but the Angels only know that four sailors beat up Poet, and he doesn't tell them how the earlier fight started. One of the sailors pulls a knife on the Angels and is then killed accidentally in the fight that follows.\n\nPoet is allowed to ride with the Angels and is eventually elevated to \"prospect\" status. He is attracted to Buddy's some-time girlfriend (Sabrina Scharf) who toys with him while remaining hopelessly committed to Buddy.\n\nMuch of the story that follows consists of scenes of the Angels partying or being provoked to violence by \"squares.\" Although the Angels are shown as being loud and generally irreverent, they are never shown starting trouble except when taking revenge on members of other motorcycle clubs.\n\nEventually, Buddy's girlfriend succeeds in provoking a confrontation between Buddy and Poet with only one surviving.\n\nAdam Roarke, who plays the Angels club president Buddy, starred in several other motorcycle films of the era.\n\nRalph 'Sonny' Barger, the president of the Oakland, California chapter of the Hells Angels, is seen in an early scene but has no spoken lines in the film. He was also credited as a consultant.\n\nJack Starrett appears as Sgt. Bingham. Sabrina Scharf later played the role of Sara in the film \"Easy Rider\" as one of the girls in the commune.\n\n\n\"Hells Angels on Wheels\" was released in theatres on December 1, 1967. The film was released on DVD on December 30, 2003.\n\n\n"}

This term applies when 90% or more of the skin is affected.\n\nIn ICD-10, a distinction is made between \"exfoliative dermatitis\" at L26, and \"erythroderma\" at L53.9.\n\nErythroderma is generalized exfoliative dermatitis, which involves 90% or more of the patient's skin. The most common cause of erythroderma is exacerbation of an underlying skin disease, such as psoriasis, contact dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, lichen planus, pityriasis rubra pilaris or a drug reaction, such as the use of topical steroids. Primary erythroderma is less frequent and is usually seen in cases of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, in particular in Sézary's disease.\n\nThe most common causes of exfoliative dermatitis are best remembered by the mnemonic device ID-SCALP. The causes and their frequencies are as follows:\n\nThe primary cause has to be treated, or the exacerbation may persist and relapse. Topical steroids are the primary category of medications used to treat exfoliative dermatitis. A sedative antihistamine may be a useful adjunct for pruritic patients, since it helps patients to sleep at night, thus limiting nocturnal scratching and excoriations. Antimicrobial agents often are used if an infection is suspected to be precipitating or complicating exfoliative dermatitis.

Art needlework emphasized delicate shading in satin stitch with silk thread accompanied by a number of novelty stitches, in sharp contrast with the counted-thread technique of the brightly colored Berlin wool work needlepoint craze of the mid-nineteenth century.\nIn embroidery as in other crafts, Morris was anxious to encourage self-expression via handcrafts. His shop Morris & Co. sold both finished custom embroideries and kits in the new style, along with vegetable dyed silks in which to work them. Art needlework was considered an appropriate style for decorating artistic dress.\n\nThe Royal School of Art Needlework (now Royal School of Needlework) was founded as a charity in 1872 under the patronage of Princess Helena to provide apprenticeships in the new/old style. Morris's daughter May, an accomplished needlewoman and designer in her own right, was active in the School from its inception.\n\nThe Leek Embroidery Society and the Leek School of Art Embroidery, both founded by embroideress Elizabeth Wardle, were established in 1879 and around 1881, respectively.\n\nArt needlework was introduced to America at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia.\n"}

It is used as an adjunct to inhaled beta-2 selective agonists and systemically administered corticosteroids.\n\nAminophylline is used to reverse regadenoson, dipyridamole or adenosine based infusions during nuclear cardiology stress testing. Aminophylline has also been reported to be effective in preventing slow heart rates during complex cardiovascular interventions [Atherectomy of the right coronary artery]. It is also used in the treatment of heart block due to acute inferior myocardial infarction.\n\nAminophylline has shown some promise as a bodyfat reducer when used as a topical cream. Aminophylline is also a treatment option for anaphylactic shock. \n\nWhile it has been suggested for use in cardiac arrest evidence does not support a benefit.\n\nAminophylline can lead to theophylline toxicity.

It acts through cellular surface receptors which effect intracellular signalling pathways to increase coronary artery blood flow, slow heart rate, block atrioventricular node conduction, suppress cardiac automaticity, and decrease β-adrenergic effects on contractility. Adenosine also antagonizes chronotropic and ionotropic effects of circulating catecholamines. Overall, adenosine decreases the heart’s rate and force of contraction, which increases blood supply to the cardiac muscle. Given specific circumstances this mechanism (which is intended to protect the heart) may cause atropine-resistant refractory bradyasystole. Adenosine's effects are concentration-dependent. Adenosine’s receptors are competitively antagonized by methylxanthines such as aminophylline. Aminophylline competitively antagonizes the cardiac actions of adenosine at the cell surface receptors. Thus, it increases heart rate and contractility.\n\n"}

He played over half of his professional career for Persepolis in the Persian Gulf Pro League. He is currently an assistant coach for the Iran national football team under Dragan Skočić.\n\nBagheri was born in Tabriz, Iran. He was discovered by manager Vasile Godja and began his football playing for his hometown club Tractor where he impressed enough to land himself a contract with Keshavarz On 1 August 1996 Bagheri was signed on free transfer by the capital's club, Persepolis. There, Bagheri enjoyed much success winning numerous titles and becoming a fan favorite. Numerous impressive displays ended up in Bagheri attracting attention from many European clubs and on 1 August 1997, a year after he signed a contract with Persepolis, Bagheri signed with German Bundesliga side Arminia Bielefeld along with his fellow Iranian international Ali Daei.\n\nBagheri's first season in Germany was not a huge success and the club was relegated to the 2nd Bundesliga. In his second season, he established himself as a starter playing in the libero position, helping the team make it back to the Bundesliga. His performances during the 98-99 season earned him a place in Kicker magazine's team of the year. He remained in Arminia for one more season, though his time in Germany ended sourly when he bought out his contract and returned to Persepolis again, though Persepolis loaned him to Al-Nasr in the UAE.\n\nAt that time English clubs were interested in Bagheri and Charlton Athletic of the Premiership quickly signed him for an initial fee of £400,000. His father's death, international call-ups and injuries restricted him from making appearances in his first year. \nAlan Curbishley his manager on Bagheri:\n\n\"\"We took him as cover for Kinsella\", Curbishley said. \"Bagheri is a holding midfielder with great physique and an eye for goal. His goal-scoring record is unbelievable. He's got almost a goal every other game in 70 internationals which is an amazing feat for a midfield player.\"\n\"\"The problem was he never stayed fit while he was with us. After playing against Ipswich he went off to play for Iran and came back with a groin strain. Then it was a hamstring. His father died and he had to return to Iran the next day and we didn't see him for three weeks. Then he injured his hamstring again. It was one thing after another. It was a pity because the boy can play. He has all the attributes and understood the English game.\n\"He's an affable lad and from day one the other players liked him. Though he didn't speak English he got on with the others who respected him. He can play a bit and in 12 reserve matches for us he managed six goals. Had he stayed fit it may have been a different story. When the loan deal ended he came to me and said `I've loved it here but I haven't done myself justice'.\n\"I've noticed he is scoring regularly for Iran and whoever picks him up at set pieces on Saturday must be alert while he times his runs from midfield very well\".\"\n\nHe had very little success there, only playing 15 minutes during the entire season in a game against Ipswich Town and being the first Iranian to play in the Premiership. He then moved to Al Sadd in Qatar.\n\nIn 2002, he decided to return to Persepolis once again. In September 2006, many thought he had been released from the team after arguments with management and staff over the club's financial commitments and unpaid wages. Bagheri was instead disciplined but remained on the team. Bagheri has since established himself as one of the greatest icons of Persepolis and many compare his popularity with Ali Parvin. In the 2007–08 season, he captained the team to glory in the IPL after a six-year drought. During the 2008–09 season he was injured and missed many matches. He also missed matches because of the differences he had with the coach Nelo Vingada at the end of the season. He was the top scorer of the team for 2009–10 season and the most influential player on the team. In the second Sorkhabi derby of the season, Bagheri scored in the 87th minute with a trademark long-range shot to gain victory for Persepolis after six consecutive draws in the derby.\n\nOn 1 December 2010, Bagheri announced that he would retire and leave Persepolis.\n\n\nBagheri was first called up to the Iranian national team during the 1994 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, making his debut versus Pakistan on 6 June 1993. He displayed great football and soon became a starter for Iran in the midfield. He played in 1996 AFC Asian Cup for \"Team Melli\" and finished third.\n\nHe sparked Iran's comeback against Australia in the second leg of their 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifier in 1997. He scored the first of two goals that took Iran from two goals down to tie the game 2–2 and eventually become the last team to qualify for the tournament. Overall, he scored 19 goals during the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign, making him the top goalscorer from all six continental confederations. He played in 1998 Asian Games and won the competition. Bagheri also had one of the strongest right-footed shots and scored many fantastic goals against opponents, such as his game-tying goal against South Korea in the quarter finals of the 2000 Asian Cup in Lebanon.\n\nOn 2 June 1997, he scored seven times against the Maldives, and equalled the record for the most goals scored in a World Cup match, which was held by the Australian Gary Cole since 1981. Their joint record was broken on 11 April 2001 when another Australian, Archie Thompson scored 13 goals against American Samoa. He was named the world's second top goal scorer in official international matches by International Federation of Football History and Statistics (IFFHS), having scored 20 goals for Iran in 1997.\n\nHe retired from the national team with 80 caps and 47 goals for \"Team Melli\" after Iran's unsuccessful FIFA World Cup 2002 qualification campaign which ended with an aggregate defeat to Republic of Ireland in November 2001. He was called up to the national team again soon after World Cup 2006, but said he would not participate as he is retired from international football and has no plans on returning to it.\n\nOn 9 October 2008, Team Melli coach Ali Daei stated that because of Andranik Teymourian's injury Bagheri will be called up for the national team once again. On 9 November 2008 in a friendly match against Qatar, he appeared for \"Team Melli\" once again after almost seven years. Bagheri captained Iran in the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification match against UAE on 19 November 2008, scoring for Iran. He has been given his favorite number 6 jersey back. He played few important matches for Team Melli in 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification against UAE and South Korea. He was invited again by Afshin Ghotbi but he stated in Navad that he only returned to Team Melli because of Ali Daei and will not participate in any more matches for Team Melli.\n\nOn 2 October 2010, Bagheri announced he would play his last match with Team Melli on 7 October 2010 against Brazil in the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.\n\nTwo years after his retirement, he was offered a coaching role at Persepolis by newly appointed head coach Yahya Golmohammadi. He was promoted as the first-team coach in the coaching staff of Ali Daei.\n\nOn 8 April 2015 Karim was named assistant manager of Persepolis again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The original \"Sundara Kanda\" is in Sanskrit and was composed by Valmiki, who was the first to scripturally record the \"Ramayana\". Sundara Kanda is the only chapter of the \"Ramayana\" in which the hero is not Rama, but rather Hanuman. The work depicts the adventures of Hanuman and his selflessness, strength, and devotion to Rama are emphasized in the text. Hanuman was fondly called “Sundara” by his mother Anjani and Sage Valmiki chose this name over others as the Sundara Kanda is about Hanuman's journey to Lanka.\n\nThe Sundara Kanda forms the heart of Valmiki's Ramayana and consists of a detailed, vivid account of Hanuman's adventures. After learning about Sita, Hanuman assumes a gargantuan form and makes a colossal leap across the ocean to Lanka after defeating Surasa, the Mother of the Nagas and Sinhika, who is sent by the Devtas.\n\nIn Lanka, Hanuman searched Sita and finally found her in Ashok Vatika.\n\nIn the Ashok Vatika, Sita is wooed and threatened by Ravana and his demon mistresses to marry Ravana. Hanuman reassures her, giving Rama's signet ring as a sign of good faith. He offers to carry Sita back to Rama, however she refuses, reluctant to allow herself to be rescued by any one, other than her husband. She says that Rama himself must come and avenge the insult of her abduction.\n\nHanuman then wreaks havoc in Lanka by destroying trees and buildings, and killing Ravana's warriors. He allows himself to be captured and produced before Ravana. He gives a bold lecture to Ravana to release Sita. He is condemned and his tail is set on fire, but he escapes his bonds and, leaping from roof to roof, sets fire to Ravana's citadel and makes the giant leap back from the island. The joyous search party returns to Kishkindha with the news.\n\nIt is traditional to begin the reading () of the Ramayana with the Sundara Kanda.\n\nThis lesson is recited by religious Hindus, preferably on Tuesdays or Saturdays, these days having been earmarked for special prayers to Hanuman. It happens to be for nullification of the malefic effects of the crow mounted, the son of Surya and Chhaya (Shadow), Lord Shani. Ramayana reveals that Shani Dev, who was captive at Ravana's palace, was rescued by Lord Hanuman. As a token of thanks, Shani Dev offered reprieve to all devotees of Lord Hanuman. Alternately once Shani Dev was caught between Hanuman's shoulders and the ceiling when attempting to mount the latter to influence his stars. Unable to bear the pain, Shani Dev offered gratitude in return to an immediate release.\n\nThe religious faith suggests that its recital brings harmony to the household. Many Hindus believe that if one does not have time to read the whole Ramayana, one should read the Sundara Kanda.\n\nMultiple variations of the \"Sundara Kanda\" exist in other languages as well, for instance in Awadhi, the language in which the saint Tulsidas wrote the \"Ramacharitamanas\". The Sri Ramacharitamanas was written much later than Valmiki's Ramayana, in the 16th century.\n\nAn earlier Tamil version, Ramavataram, by Kambar is also a prevalent text among the Sri Vaishnava and Smartha Brahmins in South India.\n\nRanganatha Ramayanam a Telugu version of valmiki Ramayan written by Gona Budha Reddy also described very well. \n\nM. S. Ramarao wrote Telugu version for Hanuman Chalisa of Tulsidas and Sundara kanda of Valmiki Ramayana as 'Sundarakandamu' in Telugu during 1972-74. He sang Sundarakanda in the form of Telugu songs. \n\nHanuman Chalisa is a different poetic contribution towards the heroics of Hanuman by the poet, Tulasidas. Though it mentions his achievements during Ramayana, it goes beyond that as well, encompassing the complete life of Hanuman.\n\nShodasi : Secrets of the Ramayana\nby Seshendra Sharma\nReviews : www.facebook.com/shodasi/\n\n"}

Durand\n\nWilliam Frederick Durand (March 5, 1859 – August 9, 1958) was a United States naval officer and pioneer mechanical engineer. He contributed significantly to the development of aircraft propellers. He was the first civilian chair of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, the forerunner of NASA.\n\nA native of Connecticut, he was a member of the first graduating class of Birmingham High School in Derby, Connecticut (now Derby High School) in 1877. He graduated second in his class at the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis and received his Ph.D. from Lafayette College. He went on to teach at the Michigan State College, Cornell University and Stanford University, teaching that school's first course in Aeronautics, the second offered by any school in the country (the first was offered by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology). He helped rebuild Stanford after the 1906 earthquake, and the department of Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering building bears his name. A memorial there reads: \"His first professional assignment in 1880 was on the USS Tennessee, a full rigged wooden ship with auxiliary steam power. His last, 1942-46 was as chairman of the National Aeronautical Commission for the development of jet propulsion for aircraft.\" He died in 1958 at the age of 99.\n\nWilliam Frederick Durand was born on March 5, 1859 in Beacon Falls, Connecticut. He was the fourth and youngest child and second son to William Leavenworth Durand and Ruth née Coe. When Durand was one year old his family moved to Derby, Connecticut. During high school Durand showed an aptitude towards mathematics, and took extra curricular studies from the principal in analytic geometry and worked as a surveyor's assistant. Durand's brother strongly recommended that he take engineering at the United States Naval Academy. The Academy's entrance exams at the time tested for familiarization with machine tools, so Durand dropped attendance in the spring semester of high school in 1876 to work in the tool room of a factory in Ansonia, Connecticut.\nDurand was one of five to graduate from the first high school graduating class.\n\nTo further prepare for the Navy Academy entrance exams, Durand attended a summer course at the Maryland Agricultural College taught by a retired American Civil War naval veteran. Travelling to Maryland for the classes, Durand stopped at the Centennial Exposition where the Corliss steam engine made a lifelong impression.\n\nIn 1876 Durand was one of 80 applicants testing for 25 openings at the academy. His first examination was in elementary mechanics, presided over by A. A. Michelson. Durand placed tenth in the exams and was admitted into the academy. During summers Durand cruised on board .\n\nAt the time graduates of the U. S. Naval Academy did not receive commission upon graduation but were required to serve two years of sea duty before being eligible. Durand graduated in 1880 from the academy with the rank of cadet engineer and was assigned to , flagship of the North Atlantic Squadron. Also assigned to \"Tennessee\" was Durand's classmate Midshipman W. S. Sims. After two years at sea Durand was given a week-long oral exam by the Naval Examining Board. Durand passed the exam and was commissioned as Assistant Engineer. \n\nDurand continued to serve on \"Tennessee\" until June 1883, when he was transferred to the Bureau of Steam Engineering. There Durand was assigned to work on the design of the engines for . While there an Act of Congress titled \"To Promote a Knowledge of Steam Engineering and Iron Shipbuilding Act\" provided officers of the Engineer Corps of the Navy as instructors to scientific and technical institutions in the United States. Durand requested a tour of duty at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania. While there Durand married Charlotte Kneen on October 23, 1883, and had a son on June 14, 1885. Durand earned a Ph.D. in engineering from Lafayette while there.\n\nIn autumn 1885 Durand was transferred to the Morgan Iron Works as an inspector on the engines for and . In November 1885 Durand received a telegram ordering him to the Brooklyn Navy Yard to participate in sea trials of . The recently completed \"Dolphin\" had received an adverse report from the Board of Inspection and Survey. Among the findings was a claim of structural weakness. Captain R. W. Meade suggested to Secretary of Navy William C. Whitney that he take \"Dolphin\" to sea in search of a storm. \"Dolphin\" was outfitted at Newport, Rhode Island, and in late November the ship sailed for Cape Hatteras, where a storm of strong wind and heavy seas was known to be. The test plan consisted of: two hours of steaming under full power directly into the storm, two hours steaming with the wind 45 degrees off the bow, two hours with the wind amidships, two hours off the quarter, and two hours with the storm astern. \"Dolphin\" passed the storm test and sailed to the Norfolk Navy Yard.\n\nDurand requested and received duty as a naval engineering instructor at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts, arriving in March 1887.\n\n\nWhile in Worcester Durand was approached by a member of the board of trustees of Michigan State College. Michigan State was looking for someone to create and head a mechanical engineering program. Durand accepted the position and resigned his commission with the US Navy effective 15 September 1887.\n\nDurand worked at Michigan State in Lansing, Michigan, for four years, creating the Department of Mechanical Engineering.\n\nIn late Spring 1891 Durand accepted the chair of mechanical engineering at Purdue University in Lafayette, Indiana. Later in the summer Durand learned that Robert H. Thurston, Director of Sibley College at Cornell University, was looking for someone to lead a planned post-graduate school of the College in Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering. Thurston agreed to hire Durand, and the administrators at Purdue agreed to let him go if he could find a suitable replacement for Purdue. Professor John Joseph Flather of the University of Minnesota accepted the position at Purdue, and Durand went to Cornell. Shortly after arriving Durand became the secretary of the Sibley faculty.\n\nIn 1892 Durand was elected a member of Sigma Xi, an engineering honors fraternity that started at Cornell in 1886. Durand would later become National President of the Society in 1936.\n\nThree accomplishments Durand thought noteworthy during his years at Cornell were the development of logarithmic paper, developing theoretically and mechanically an averaging radial planimeter, and research on marine propellers.\n\nIn 1893 Durand developed and introduced Logarithmic graph paper, where the logarithmic scale is marked off in distances proportional to the logarithms of the values being represented. Keuffel and Esser Company listed logarithmic paper in their general catalog as \"Durand's Logarithmic Paper\" as late as 1936.\n\nIn 1893 Durand published a paper mathematically describing a radial planimeter for averaging values plotted in polar coordinates. Originally a radial planimeter was of academic interest only, but ten years later clock driven recording instruments started being used. Durand created working device based on his theory. He patented the device and received royalties from a scientific instrument company making the devices until the patent expired.\n\nDurand conducted research on the theory of operation of marine screw propellers while at Cornell. Using funding from the Carnegie Institute, a concrete canal was built in the Hydraulic Laboratory for the study of propellers. Approximately forty-nine twelve inch diameter model propellers with varying pitch and proportion were tested over the course of several years.\n\nOn October 25, 1903 Robert Thurston died and Durand became acting Director of Sibley College while Cornell searched for a permanent replacement. When A. W. Smith of Stanford University became Director David Starr Jordan, president of Stanford, offered Durand a position at Stanford to replace the vacancy created by the leaving of Smith. Durand accepted the offer and moved to Stanford in August 1904.\n\nDurand was the director of the mechanical engineering department and acting director of the electrical engineering department. Durand recruited H. J. Ryan from Cornell to be director of electrical engineering, a position Ryan held from 1905 until his death in 1934.\n\nAt 5:20 AM on April 20, 1906 Durand was awakened by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. A marble statue of Louis Agassiz fell headfirst, piercing the concrete sidewalk. University president Jordan commented \"Agassiz was always a hard-headed scientist.\" Durand was appointed to a Board of Engineers tasked with clearing the ruins and making temporary repairs allowing the university to reopen in the fall. Stanford reopened in September for fall semester, and reconstruction was not completed until 1908.\n\nIn 1912 Durand chaired the Committee of Management in preparation for the Engineering Congress held in conjunction with the 1915 Panama–Pacific International Exposition. George Washington Goethals was Honorary President of the Congress. Afterwards Durand compiled and edited the papers read before the congress into 18 volumes, mailing them to subscribers.\n\nIn 1914 Durand attended a conference convened by Charles Doolittle Walcott, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC for the purpose of stimulating interest in aeronautic science, and its relation to the U. S. government. The conference led to an act of congress organizing an Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (later the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics) \"to supervise and direct the scientific study of the problems of flight with a view to their practical solution.\"\nThis committee was composed of twelve members, two each from the Army and Navy, one each representing the Smithsonian Institution, the Weather Bureau, and the National Bureau of Standards. Five additional members were chosen \"who shall be acquainted with the needs of aeronautical science, either civil or military, or skilled in aeronautical engineering or its allied sciences.\" Brigadier General George P. Scriven, Chief Signal Officer of the Army, was chairman of the committee, Walcott was elected chairman of the Executive Committee. President Woodrow Wilson appointed Durand as one of the civilian members of the Committee.\n\nDurand became Chairman of the NACA in the fall of 1916 at the second meeting of the full committee.\n\nDurand proposed to the NACA the need for research on aircraft propellers, modeled on the work he had done on marine propellers at Cornell. The Committee agreed and Stanford University was contracted to perform the testing. Working with Professor E. P. Lesley, Durand conducted the air propeller research for the following twelve or fifteen years. Test results were published to the Committee and annually in reports.\n\nThe United States declared war on Germany in April, 1917. Durand obtained a leave of absence from Stanford to devote working full-time at the NACA. The United States concentrated on developing training, reconnaissance, and bomber airplanes while relying on the British and French for fighters. The NACA directed the development of the Liberty aeronautical engine.\n\nAn impediment early in the war to rapidly improving aircraft were concerns about aircraft patents. To address this a conference of the leaders of the aircraft industry was convened. After several sessions a cross-license agreement was arranged calling for the common use of all important aircraft patents for the duration of the war.\n\nDurand worked to create aviation ground schools at between six and ten universities for the creation of aviation ground schools. The ground school curricula included aircraft control, flight theory, science, and meteorology.\n\nDurand first flew in an airplane in 1917. That year the Italian government was showcasing a large triplane built in the city of Genoa to U. S. Government officials hoping for sales. A party of four or five officials took a trip from Langley Field to Washington D.C., a distance of 120 miles, lasting over an hour.\n\nIn 1917 Durand, metallurgist Dr. Henry M. Howe, and Dr. John J. Carty, Chief Engineer of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company were elected to the National Academy of Sciences to form the nucleus of an engineering section of the academy.\n\nIn autumn of 1917 Durand initiated the development of the airplane turbosuperchargers. The NACA had received incomplete reports that a French engineer named Auguste Rateau was attempting to develop engines for high altitudes using a turbo-driven air compressor. Remembering a graduate student named Sanford A. Moss who worked on gas driven turbo engines twenty years earlier at Cornell before starting a career at the gas turbine division of General Electric, Durand wrote to the president of GE, Mr. E. W. Rice requesting Dr. Moss' services. After this turbochargers became Moss' life work.\n\nOn May 11, 1918 President Woodrow Wilson signed an Executive Order creating the National Research Council, the working arm of the National Academy of Sciences. Durand was appointed head of the Engineering Division. Both the NACA and the NRC had offices in the Munsey Trust Building in Washington separated by two floors. Durand climbed stairs or rode the elevator several times a day between the two.\n\nIn December 1917 Durand, accompanied by his chief assistant Karl T. Compton and two others, traveled to Paris maintain continuous and close contact with developments in the applications of science in warfare. Upon arriving Durand was given the title Scientific Attaché to the U. S. Embassy, though he worked independently of Ambassador William Graves Sharp. He did take advantage of the embassy's diplomatic bag to send reports back to Washington.\n\nIn March 1918 Durand experienced the shelling of Paris by the German Paris gun. After an early morning air raid alarm was sounded Durand walked to the Place de la Concorde to witness the raid. Upon arriving at the obelisk he heard an explosion but was unable to see any airplanes. While searching the sky another explosion occurred. The bombardment continued throughout the day, with a shell landing every 15 to 20 minutes. One landed quite close to Durand, hitting the Tuileries Garden.\n\nIn June 1918 Durand traveled from Paris to London to give the annual Wilbur & Orville Wright Named Lecture of the Royal Aeronautical Society. Before an audience of 2000 people Durand give a lecture addressing the problems of aircraft design, construction and operation as factors in a war effort. On the occasion of his talk Durand was elected a Fellow of the society.\n\nWith the Armistice World War I ended on November 11, 1918. Durand returned to Stanford on February 22, 1919 and resumed teaching.\n\nIn 1924 Durand reached Stanford's mandatory retirement age of 65 and became Professor Emeritus. Durand continued testing model aircraft propellers, research that had begun under the NACA in 1915.\n\nIn fall 1924 Durand was elected to a one-year term as President of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers for 1925-26. Durand had been a continuous member of the society since joining while serving on board the USS Tennessee in 1883. To be near the society headquarters, Durand lived in Brooklyn, New York during his term in office.\n\nOn September 10, 1924 Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover asked Durand to become a member of the Board of Visitors of the Bureau of Standards. The board visited the Bureau several times over the course of a year to confer and advise the Director and be a conduit between the Bureau and outside entities. Durand was a member of the board for several years.\n\nIn spring of 1925 Durand was appointed by President Calvin Coolidge to the Board of Visitors of the United States Naval Academy. The board visits the academy to attend classes, attend classes, observe drills and exercises and observe the overall performance of the institution.\n\nOn September 3, 1925, the US Navy dirigible USS Shenandoah crashed in southeastern Ohio. US Army general Billy Mitchell accused the War and Navy Departments of causing the accident through \"criminal negligence.\" The army brought court-martial charges against Mitchell. Due to public pressure President Coolidge created a Board of Aeronautic Inquiry chaired by Dwight Morrow.\n\nOn September 11, 1925 Durand learned over the radio that Coolidge had appointed him to the board. The board was tasked to study aeronautics in relation to national defense and advise the president on policy to develop aircraft in time of war. The board was composed of Morrow as chairman, U. S. Judge Arthur C. Denison as vice chairman, Durand as secretary, Hiram Bingham, James S. Parker, Carl Vinson, Maj. Gen. James G. Harbord (ret.), Rear Admiral Frank F. Fletcher (ret.), and Howard E. Coffin.\n\nThe first meeting of the board was held at the White House where Durand was chosen to be secretary of the board. After weeks of meetings receiving expert testimony and conferring the board submitted a report to the President recommending a near term development plan for military and naval aircraft. The report further recommended the creation of the offices of Assistant Secretary for Military and for Naval aircraft within the War and Navy Departments.\n\nIn 1926 or 1927 Durand was invited by Daniel Guggenheim to join the Board of Trustees of the Daniel Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion of Aeronautics. The board asked Durand to make recommendations on the proposal of creating an encyclopedia of aeronautics. Durand determined quickly that the overall field of aeronautics was still developing very rapidly and an encyclopedic overview would rapidly become obsolete. He recommended instead that fluid mechanics theory and its application to aeronautics was mature and stable enough for an encyclopedia. The board agreed, tasking Durand to direct and supervise the effort. Durand worked on the encyclopedia full-time for the next six years. He sailed to Europe and met Theodore von Kármán of Aachen University to find the best qualified authors. Twenty five authors wrote twenty divisions in six volumes for a total of 2200 pages. No American publisher was willing to print the encyclopedia due to concern of the number of potential sales. Springer & Co. of Berlin agreed to publish the volumes in English.\n\nThe final volume was published in 1936.\n\nDuring World War II there was renewed demand for the encyclopedia and a second printing was made by photo-offset printing at the California Institute of Technology.\n\nIn 1926 Durand and E. P. Leslie reported on comparisons of propeller efficiency in a wind tunnel versus free flight. Leslie tested seven propellers with a VE-7. Durand's wind tunnel model showed similar efficiency to Leslie's measurements, but lagged by 6% to 10% in thrust developed and power absorbed.\n\nIn 1927 Durand became a member of a board of advisers to the Secretary of Work of the United States Department of the Interior. The board was tasked to survey the Colorado River to find solutions to annual flooding, silting, the development of hydroelectric power, and water usage for irrigation and by cities such as Los Angeles, California.\n\nOn 12 February 1935 The US Navy rigid airship USS Macon crashed in a storm off Point Sur, California. Investigations were conducted by a Naval Board of Inquiry and a scientific review board. Science Advisory Board Chairman Karl T. Compton appointed a Special Committee on Airships at the request of Secretary of the Navy Claude Swanson. Members of the committee were Robert A. Millikan and Theodore von Kármán of Caltech, William Hovgaard of M.I.T., Durand and Stephen Timoshenko of Stanford, Frank B. Jewett of Bell Telephone Laboratories, and Charles F. Kettering of General Motors. Durand was the chairman.\n\nUpon request of the United States Department of the Navy, the National Academy of Sciences established a committee chaired by Durand to investigate anti-rolling devices on ships. The ability to stabilize a ship such as an aircraft carrier would be extremely useful during the landing of airplanes. The committee established an experimental laboratory at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Dr. Nicolas Minorsky worked on roll stabilization of ships for the navy from 1934 to 1940, designing in 1938 an activated-tank stabilization system into a 5-ton model ship. A full-scale version of the system was tested in but exhibited control stability problems. Very promising results were beginning to appear when the outbreak of the Second World War interrupted further development as the Hamilton was called to active duty and the 5 ton model was put into storage.\n\nIn March 1941 Chairman of the NACA Vannevar Bush asked the then 82-year-old Durand to head a committee to study and develop jet propulsion for aircraft. The committee was composed of members from General Electric, Westinghouse, and Allis-Chalmers. The committee agreed early that the three companies would work separately developing jet engines to promote diversity in design.\n\nChief of the Air Corp Henry H. Arnold obtained a Whittle jet engine from England which was turned over to the gas turbine division of GE in Lynn, Massachusetts for test and copy. General Electric developed this into the J31. Durand witnessed a static test of the engine in Lynn, Massachusetts on July 13, 1942 alongside Sanford A. Moss, the engineer Durand had requested from General Electric for the development of turbosuperchargers during World War I. Moss had retired from GE but worked as a consultant on the jet engine. Durand and Moss spoke to each other of the early development of the turbosupercharger as the manager of the facility recorded their conversation. On October 2, 1941 Durand witnessed the first official flight of the J31 equipped Bell P-59 Airacomet at Muroc Army Air Field (today, Edwards Air Force Base). Westinghouse developed the J30 engine from this effort. Durand led the jet engine effort from April 2, 1941 to July 7, 1945, at which time Durand was 86 years old\n\nAlso beginning in early spring 1941 Durand chaired the Engineering Division of the National Research Council. Durand split his work days, mornings at the NACA, afternoons at the NRC. Durand was greatly helped by the NRC Division Executive Secretary William H. Kenerson of Brown University.\n\n\n"}

Owned by Metropolitan Indianapolis Public Media, Inc., it is a sister station to National Public Radio (NPR) member WFYI-FM (90.1 MHz). The two stations share studios between Pierson and Illinois Streets (using a North Meridian Street address) north of downtown Indianapolis, within the city's Television Row section. The TV station's transmitter is located on West 79th Street and Township Line Road on the city's northwest side (near Meridian Hills).\n\nOn cable, WFYI is available on Comcast Xfinity channel 3 and on Charter Spectrum and AT&T U-verse channel 20.\n\nLocal community leader Ardath Y. Burkhart formed a small grassroots campaign to launch a non-commercial educational television station to serve Indianapolis. Burkhart (whose group became known as \"Ardath's Army\") quickly gained support in the community by stating her case to residents in Indianapolis and surrounding counties. The volunteers raised enough funds over the course of a few weeks to cover a year's worth of operating expenses.\n\nThe station first signed on the air on October 4, 1970; for its first two days on the air, it served as a member station of National Educational Television (NET), before becoming a member of the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) when it launched on October 6, 1970. WFYI's transmitter originally operated at low power, providing a signal reach not far outside of downtown Indianapolis. It started with a small staff of nine employees from its Meridian Street studio facilities (located just north of downtown), which formerly housed the headquarters of utility company Indiana Gas. Despite the fact that color television had become commonplace at the time, the station could afford to purchase only three cameras that were capable of recording locally produced programming in black-and-white, not color. The station eventually increased its transmitter power to allow its signal to cover a radius from the tower, expanding to cover a larger portion of Central Indiana.\n\nIn the early 1980s, WFYI's programming was relayed on translator station W39AA in Fort Wayne (the low-powered repeater previously relayed fellow PBS station WBGU-TV in Bowling Green, Ohio). That translator was a stopgap to provide educational programming to Fort Wayne, as UHF channel 39 was allocated for educational use. Channel 39 became a separate, full-powered PBS member outlet, WFWA, in December 1986.\n\nThe station's current president and CEO, Lloyd Wright, also serves on PBS' national board of directors.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nOn digital subchannel 20.2, the station carries children's programming from PBS Kids during the 24/7 hours. Digital subchannel 20.3 airs a mix of programming from Create during the daytime hours, programming from the Indiana Channel during the late afternoon and evening hours and the Classic Arts Showcase during the overnight hours.\n\nWFYI signed on its digital signal in 2003. The station shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 20, at 11:59 p.m. on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. WFYI ran a video in the minutes leading up to the shutdown of the analog signal overviewing its primary digital channel and two subchannels (\"WFYI 2\" and \"WFYI 3\"), which re-aired following a retrospective on the station's history. The station's digital signal continued to broadcast on its pre-transition UHF channel 21. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 20.\n\nWFYI's most notable locally produced programs include the travel programs \"Across Indiana\" and \"Indiana Expeditions with Rick Crosslin\", the business discussion program \"INside Indiana Business\", legal advice program \"Indiana Lawmakers\", film showcase \"Reel Time\" and the public affairs programs \"Indiana PrimeTime\" and \"Indiana Week in Review\". The station's locally originated programming has earned WFYI over 30 Regional Emmy Awards since the mid-2000s.\n\n"}
{"id": "2294860", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2294860", "title": "The Fortune", "text": "The Fortune\n\nThe Fortune is a 1975 American comedy film starring Jack Nicholson and Warren Beatty, and directed by Mike Nichols. The screenplay by Adrien Joyce focuses on two bumbling con men who plot to steal the fortune of a wealthy young heiress, played by Stockard Channing in her first film starring role.\n\nNicky Wilson (Beatty) and Oscar Sullivan (Nicholson) are inept 1920s scam artists in Northeastern United States who see pay dirt in the guise of Fredericka Quintessa \"Freddie\" Bigard (Stockard Channing), the millionaire heiress to a sanitary napkin fortune. She loves the already married Nicky, but because the Mann Act prohibits him from taking her across state lines and engaging in immoral relations, he proposes that she marry Oscar and then carry on an affair with the man she wants. Oscar, who is wanted for embezzlement and anxious to get out of town, is happy to comply with the plan, although he intends to claim his spousal privileges after they are wed.\n\nOnce they reach Los Angeles, the men try everything they can to separate Freddie from her inheritance without success, but with sufficient determination to arouse her suspicions. When she announces her plan to donate her money to charity, Nicky and Oscar conclude that murder might be their only recourse if they're going to get rich quick. Eventually arrested for the murder, Nicky and Oscar confess everything to the L.A.P.D.. This leads to unusual complications when the arresting detective meets the very-alive Freddie, who passed out and was oblivious to the entire \"murder\", and is shocked to hear the story.\n\nWhen Warren Beatty was unable to stir interest in his and Robert Towne's screenplay for \"Shampoo\", about a befuddled but seductive hairdresser, which he had been developing since 1967, he bundled it with the more appealing \"The Fortune\" and convinced Columbia Pictures head David Begelman to finance both films. The fact that Carole Eastman, writing under the pen name Adrien Joyce, had yet to complete her 240-page script fazed Beatty less than it did director Mike Nichols, who needed a box office hit after \"Catch-22\" and \"The Day of the Dolphin\", both of which were critical and commercial flops.\n\nThe working relation between the screenwriter and director was amiable until Eastman objected to the many cuts Nichols was making to the script and his determination to make it less satirical and more slapstick, and she was eventually fired from the production.\n\nNichols wanted Bette Midler to portray Freddie, but he changed his mind when, seemingly unaware of his career, Midler insulted him by asking what films he had previously made. He ultimately cast relative newcomer Stockard Channing, whose credits were limited to a few television appearances and a minor role in the Barbra Streisand film \"Up the Sandbox\".\n\nBecause the start of principal photography on \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" was delayed, Jack Nicholson, who had worked with Nichols on \"Carnal Knowledge\", was available for the role of Oscar Sullivan. During filming, the actor was forced to deal with two events that impacted his personal life. First, a fact checker working on a biographical piece for \"Time\" discovered that the woman Nicholson believed was his sister was actually his mother, and the woman who raised him was his grandmother. Then his close friend Cass Elliot died in her sleep, and rumors about the cause of her death circulated in the media. These two events, linked with the film's eventual failure, made \"The Fortune\" a subject that Nicholson never discussed in interviews and biographies.\n\nThe film was shot on location in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and on a segment of street constructed in the corner of the former RKO Forty Acres backlot where the \"Stalag 13\" sets for TV's \"Hogan's Heroes\" were located during the Desilu days. Nichols did not direct another film for seven years.\n\nVincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" called the film \"very funny,\" \"manically scatterbrained,\" and \"a marvelous attempt to recreate a kind of farce that, with the notable exceptions of a handful of films by Blake Edwards and Billy Wilder, disappeared after World War II.\" He added, \"\"The Fortune\" does have sequences that sag, and there are moments when it's obvious that farce is not exactly the native art of any of the people involved. One occasionally is aware of the tremendous effort that has gone into a particular effect, though that doesn't spoil it for me. The endeavor is nobly conceived in an era that has just about abandoned farce in favor of parody, satire, situation and/or wise-crack comedy, all of which Mr. Nichols already can do with – perhaps – too great an ease. \"The Fortune\" will probably be compared to \"The Sting\", because of the overlapping of the eras and the con-man theme. Incorrectly, though. \"The Sting\" is an adventure. \"The Fortune\" is farce of a rare order.\"\n\n\"Time Out London\" said it \"starts promisingly as a sardonic comedy . . . but once in California lethargy settles in. The film becomes almost static, a series of stagy, glossy tableaux: such lack of momentum may be an adequate assessment of the characters' limited capacity for development, but it has a disastrous effect on the film's pacing. Events degenerate into miscalculated farce and underline Nichols' continuing slick superficiality. Adrien Joyce's much hacked-about script sounds as though it was once excellent: a pity everyone treats it so off-handedly.\"\n\nChannel 4 called it a \"flat-footed attempt to revive the 1930s screwball comedy\" but liked the leads, commenting, \"The trio's timing and delivery almost rescue the movie from degenerating into bad farce.\"\n\n\"TV Guide\" rated it four stars, calling it \"an offbeat but often hilarious comedy\" and adding, the film \"works well through the fine performances of the leads and the superb timing of director Nichols.\" It concluded, \"Full of period and period-sounding music, \"The Fortune\" is cold to the core – agreeably disagreeable amusement.\"\n\nStockard Channing was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actress but lost to Marilyn Hassett in \"The Other Side of the Mountain\".\n\n\n"}

It is relatively rectangular, bounded roughly by Gaston Avenue on the NW, Paulus Avenue on the NE, Reiger Avenue on the SE, and Henderson Avenue on the SW.\n\nJunius Heights was built at what was the eastern edge of the city of Dallas in the late 1910s and construction continued into the 1930s. Most of the houses are Craftsman and Prairie style bungalows with a smattering of other styles. The neighborhood was served by the Junius Heights streetcar line until streetcar service was discontinued in Dallas.\n\nThe neighborhood was cut in two in the early 1970s when Abrams Road was extended from Junius St. to connect with Columbia Ave. The landmark Junius Heights columns were moved at the same time. The original plan called for them to be demolished but a neighborhood effort resulted in them being moved instead.\n\nIn 2006 the community became known as a historic district.\n\nJunius Heights has an active neighborhood association. For more information you can visit the official site: Junius Heights Neighborhood\n\nIn 2010 Junius Heights was named \"Best Place for Families\" during its listing on This Old House's \"Best Old House Neighborhoods 2010\".\n\nMost residences are single family houses with most constructed in the period 1906-1940. In 2011 some houses were recently constructed. In 2011 Dawn McMullan of \"D Magazine\" wrote that the \"city within a city\" vibe in East Dallas is \"even more so in Junius Heights because of its proximity to restaurants and retail.\"\n\n it had about 700 families.\n\nLandmarks in and near Junius Heights include:\n• the Lakewood Theater and Lakewood shopping center outside the northern tip of the neighborhood\n• the Lakewood branch of the Dallas Public Library at Abrams Rd. and Worth St., adjacent to the district\n• Woodrow Wilson High School (Official Dallas Landmark, State of Texas Historical Marker, recognition by the National Trust for Historic Preservation) at Columbia Ave. and Glasgow St., near the district\n• J.L.

Residents are zoned to William Lipscomb Elementary School (grades PK-5), J.L. Long Middle School, and Woodrow Wilson High School.\n\nLipscomb is inside the Junius Heights Historic District, and Woodrow Wilson is adjacent to the historic district. Dallas Public Library operates the Lakewood Public Library, which is also inside the historic district.\n\nIn addition to Junius Heights, Lipscomb also serves Munger Place and Swiss Avenue. By 2008 DISD made the school only serve grades K to 3, with grades 4 and 5 from the Lipscomb zone assigned to Mata Elementary. By that year parents campaigned for the return of grades 4 and 5 to Lipscomb. In 2008 Lipscomb began serving the 4th grade. Lipscomb now serves all elementary grades.\n\nMata, now Eduardo Mata Montessori School, a K-8 school, gives second admission priority to people zoned to Woodrow Wilson High. Therefore Junius Heights is one of the neighborhoods with priority for the school.\n\n"}

He is known for his book, \"American Liberalism and World Politics, 1931–1941\" (1964). Fellow Holocaust denier Harry Elmer Barnes called it \"unquestionably the most formidable achievement of World War II Revisionism.\"\n\n\nMartin was a close associate of historian Harry Elmer Barnes. Martin's own views were market-libertarian and individualist anarchist. He was also an egoist influenced by Max Stirner and rejected the natural rights views held by some other libertarians. His work was praised by New Left historian William Appleman Williams, libertarian theorist Murray Rothbard, and others.\n\nAfter a teaching career at Northern Illinois University, San Francisco State College, and Deep Springs College, he took a job teaching at Robert LeFevre's Rampart College, assuming it would be a full-time job. This was not the case as Rampart College was not yet really a college but only a series of workshop/lectures on libertarian political economy. That led to an eventual falling out between Martin and LeFevre when Rampart College went out of business three years after Martin was hired, with Martin charging LeFevre with a breach of his five-year contract.\n\nIn 1968, after Rampart College folded and Barnes had died, Martin founded the small Ralph Myles Publisher in Colorado Springs, at first to publish \"Harry Elmer Barnes: Learned Crusader\". Ralph Myles also reprinted \"Men Against the State\", published a new book by Lawrence Dennis, reprinted a history of American anti-militarism by Arthur Ekirch, and brought several World War I revisionist books and a series of classic anarchist writings back into print, such as \"\" by Lysander Spooner and \"In Quest of Truth and Justice\" by Harry Elmer Barnes. Martin also was the author of books on anti-war subjects including \"Revisionist Viewpoints\" and \"The Saga of Hog Island\", both of them collections of anti-World War II essays, and \"An American Adventure in Bookburning\", a history of censorship in the United States during World War I.\n\nFrom 1979, Martin began to associate with the Institute for Historical Review (IHR), a Holocaust denial group, writing for the IHR journal, \"The Journal of Historical Review\". Brian Doherty notes in \"Radicals for Capitalism\": \"Martin, in his attempt to adjust standard historical understandings of war and war guilt, shifted into questioning the veracity of standard anti-German atrocity stories, including the standard details of the Holocaust\", calls it an \"unfortunate shading over into Hitler apologetics\", and that Martin stated as early as 1976 \"I don't believe that the evidence of a planned extermination of the entire Jewish population of Europe is holding up.\" One of his last books was \"The Man Who Invented Genocide: The Public Career and Consequences of Raphael Lemkin\" published by IHR in 1984.\n\n\n"}

It ran for 32 issues and an \"Annual\", which were published from 1986 to 1989.\n\nThe title stands for Displaced Paranormals and refers to the seven main characters of the series (who never refer to themselves as displaced). All of them received superhuman powers as a result of the stellar phenomenon known as the White Event.\n\n\"D.P. 7\" was the only New Universe series to maintain a stable creative team during its first year: its entire run was written by Mark Gruenwald, penciled by Paul Ryan, and colored by Paul Becton. Inker Danny Bulanadi (who began work on the title with issue #10) and letterer Janice Chiang (who began with issue #16) also stayed with \"D.P. 7\" through to the final issue.\n\nEager for the chance to work on \"a virgin universe\", writer Mark Gruenwald signed on to the New Universe staff and developed \"D.P. 7\", shocking many readers (and even editor-in-chief Jim Shooter) who saw Gruenwald as strictly associated with the Marvel Universe. In an effort to set the series apart from other team books, Gruenwald wrote an analysis of 14 superhero groups in categories such as age makeup, origin, purpose, and budget, and deliberately constructed the group to differ from these 14 established groups in every category. He originally wanted the series to be called \"Missing Persons\", with a lineup consisting of Antibody, the Blur, Man Power, Quicksand, Twilight, and Vice Versa. Of these six, only the Blur and Twilight were included in the finalized lineup, though the name \"Antibody\" was used for a completely different character and the character Vice Versa served as a minor villain of the series. Gruenwald also changed the name to \"M.P. 7 (Missing Paranormals)\", before Jack Morelli suggested \"D.P. 7\". Gruenwald explained, \"I wanted the book to have a real punk - new wave - name.\"\n\nAt the time that he conceived the \"Missing Persons\" skeleton concept, Gruenwald was working on the final issues of the \"Squadron Supreme\" limited series with penciler Paul Ryan. He invited Ryan to work with him on the New Universe series; Ryan, being intrigued by the New Universe concept and having no prospects lined up after the end of \"Squadron Supreme\", agreed. He later recounted his experience working on the series: \"Mark absolutely believed in the New Universe and especially the cast of \"D.P. 7\". We talked about them as if they were people we knew and cared about. We brought many of our real-life experiences, both positive and negative, to the series. We loved our characters.\"\n\nDespite the creators' enthusiasm, the series met with mixed reactions from readers. Many criticized the fact that though the New Universe lineup was supposed to take place in real time, the first 13 issues of \"D.P. 7\" (more than a year in real time) cover less than half a year in New Universe time. The remaining 19 issues were widely criticized for the way the series branched off into an increasing number of unrelated plotlines and an almost overwhelming large cast, and Gruenwald himself admitted at the time that \"\"D.P. 7\" really hasn't been seven guys for a while, and certainly not the original seven.\" The lack of a central plotline stemmed from the fact that Gruenwald did not plot the series more than one issue in advance. Praise for \"D.P. 7\" tended to center on its compelling characters, particularly mainstays Randy O'Brien and David Landers.\n\n\"D.P. 7\" was canceled in June 1989 along with the rest of the New Universe line. The creators' interest in the characters remained, and in \"Quasar\" #31 (February 1992), Gruenwald has Quasar travel to the New Universe, thus allowing the \"D.P. 7\" cast to guest-star in the issue. Ryan claims that he and Gruenwald had discussed doing a \"D.P. 7\" limited series or graphic novel, but Gruenwald died before he was able to finish the plot.\n\nRandy O'Brien first encounters David Landers when he is wheeled into the hospital in incredible pain. Landers rages until two dark arms spring from O'Brien's torso that restrain him long enough for O'Brien to give Landers a tranquilizer that renders him unconscious. The two compare their experiences, and O'Brien reads a classified ad for the Clinic for Paranormal Research, a facility designed to help individuals who have acquired strange abilities. He relays the information to Landers and they travel to the Clinic under assumed names. They are at first convinced of the Clinic staff's sincerity and are enrolled into Therapy Group C, where they meet Walters, Beck, Cuzinski, Harrington, and Fenzl. Late one night, O'Brien's antibody intrudes on the Clinic staff, at least four of whom are paranormals themselves, and learn the Clinic has plans to make an army out of them, to be led by Philip Nolan Voigt, the Clinic director.\n\nTherapy Group C fights off the Clinic staff and the paranormal Hackbarth, who can manipulate others' nervous systems. They escape into the night and over the next few months, the paranormals adjust to life with their powers. They are eventually apprehended by bounty hunters and returned to the Clinic. O'Brien and Landers, the last two to arrive, find that their friends have been behavior-modified to not remember their escape or the Clinic's ulterior motives. O'Brien and Landers defeat Voigt and he disappears from the Clinic. although he later reappears to successfully run for President of the United States in 1988.\n\nWithout Voigt and his senior staff (Hackbarth is in a coma, memory manipulator Charne was choked to death by an Antibody, and telepathic Speck was shot) to surreptitiously maintain order, paranormals at the Clinic soon form their own special interest groups/gangs (one is composed of teenagers, one of African Americans, etc.). The potential for disaster is soon fulfilled, and law enforcement comes in to shut the Clinic down, killing many of the patients in the process. By this time, most of the reformed Therapy Group C (along with a few other residents of the Clinic) left to find Walters, who had run to Pittsburgh where his family had been caught in a major disaster. Except for Scuzz, the Displaced Paranormals begin to work with the government after all male paranormals are drafted into the United States Army after the destruction of Pittsburgh, believed to be caused by a nuclear weapon. Female paranormals become highly sought-after assets for other agencies like the CIA. With the exception of Walters, who continues in the Army, the other paranormals either go AWOL or leave the CIA and many of them move into New York City trying to live normal lives, in the face of the public leeriness of paranormals.\n\nWhile in the city, some ongoing romances play out, while other paranormals decide to become part of a superhero team.\n\nWhen the war is over, the paranormals (who had not been cured) return to lives that are as normal as they can be.\n\n\nThe series grew to include several additional protagonists:\n\nDue to the multiverse traveling Exiles chasing Proteus, the team recruited D.P.7 just as they left the clinic along with Starbrand, Nightmask and Justice. In the following battle, Proteus took over the body of Justice and fled their universe and the Exiles followed, leaving the team behind, but now aware of other paranormals.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He first played briefly in April, then endeared himself memorably to fans in September by hitting 10 home runs, including three grand slams, then a record for Major League Rookies, until it was broken by Alexei Ramírez in 2008. Spencer accomplished the feat in only 67 at-bats, earning him a spot on the Yankees postseason roster.\n\nAdditionally, Spencer was nicknamed Roy Hobbs in reference to the protagonist in \"The Natural\", because he hit many home runs and was older than most rookies when brought up to the majors. \n\nIn the postseason, Spencer hit a long home run in Yankee Stadium during the 1998 American League Division Series against the Texas Rangers as the Yankees went on to win the World Series.\n\nSpencer was not able to maintain that level of success, but became a solid role player and stayed with the Yankees through the season, having played in four World Series, winning three.

He was the inventor of the Henry rifle, the first reliable lever-action repeating rifle.\n\nHenry was born in Claremont, New Hampshire in 1821. He apprenticed to a gunsmith as a young man and worked his way up to shop foreman at the Robins & Lawrence Arms Company of Windsor, Vermont where he worked with Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson on a rifle known as the \"Volitional Repeater\".\n\nIn 1854, Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson formed a new company with Courtlandt Palmer, and further improved the operating mechanism, developing the Smith & Wesson Lever pistol, and a new Volcanic cartridge. Production was in the shop of Horace Smith in Norwich, Connecticut. Originally using the name \"Smith & Wesson Company\", the name was changed to \"Volcanic Repeating Arms Company\" in 1855, with the addition of new investors, one of whom was Oliver Winchester. The Volcanic Repeating Arms Company obtained all rights for the Volcanic designs (both rifle and pistol versions were in production by this time) as well as the ammunition, from the Smith & Wesson Company. Wesson remained as plant manager for 8 months before rejoining Smith to found the \"Smith & Wesson Revolver Company\" upon obtaining the licensing of the Rollin White rear loading cylinder patent. Winchester forced the insolvency of the Volcanic Arms Company in late 1856, took over ownership and moved the plant to New Haven, Connecticut, where it was reorganized as the New Haven Arms Company in April 1857 and Henry was hired as plant superintendent. On October 16, 1860, he received a patent on the Henry .44 caliber repeating rifle, which soon proved the worth of the lever-action design on the battlefields of the American Civil War, where Henry rifles were used alongside muzzle-loading rifled muskets such as the Springfield Model 1861. The first Henry rifles were not produced for army use until mid-1862.\n\nIn 1864, Henry grew angry over what he believed was inadequate compensation and attempted to have the Connecticut legislature award ownership of New Haven Arms to him. Oliver Winchester, hastening back from Europe, forestalled the move and reorganized New Haven Arms yet again as the Winchester Repeating Arms Company. Winchester had the basic design of the Henry rifle completely modified and improved to become the first Winchester rifle, the Model 1866, which fired the same .44 caliber rimfire cartridges as the Henry but had an improved magazine with the addition of a loading gate on the right side of the receiver (invented by Winchester employee Nelson King) and, for the first time, a wooden forearm.\n\nHenry left the Winchester Repeating Arms Company over this dispute and worked as an individual gunsmith until his death in 1898.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2294902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2294902", "title": "Huang Tingjian", "text": "Huang Tingjian\n\nHuang Tingjian (; 1045–1105) was a Chinese calligrapher, painter, and poet of the Song dynasty. He is predominantly known as a calligrapher, and is also admired for his painting and poetry. He was one of the Four Masters of the Song Dynasty (), and was a younger friend of Su Shi and influenced by his and his friends' practice of literati painting (), calligraphy, and poetry.\n\nHuang Tingjian was born into the prominent Huang clan, which had established residence in Jiangnan, south of the Yangzi River, just across the river gorge from the main turmoils and troubles of the Five Dynasties period. Tingjian's great-great-grandfather had then and there established a great library, together with an educational system. Achievement of the \"jinshi\" degree was a common attainment for men of the Huang clan. Huang Tingjian's mother, Lady Li, was an accomplished painter of bamboo and player of the guqin. His father, Huang Shu (,1018-1058) received his \"jinshi\" in 1042, and introduced his son Huang Tingjian to the works of Du Fu and Han Yu, before dying when Tingjian was 13 years old, at which point Huang Tingjian left his hometown of Fenning (,in modern Jiangxi).\n\nAfter his father's death, Huang Tingjian was sent to Anhui to be further brought up by his uncle, Li Chang (,1027-1090), who was also possessed of a large library.\n\nHuang Tingjian failed his \"jinshi\" in the Imperial examination, at his first attempt, in 1064, but was passed in 1067, when he was 22 years old. His first employment was in Song Shenzong's first year as emperor.\n\nIn 1068-1069 a series of major earthquakes occurred southwest of modern Tianjin. The devastating human consequences were noted by Huang Tingjian. This was the occasion of his writing the poem \"Lament for the Refugees\" (, using the imagery of a giant tortoise moving mountains which it carried upon its back .\n\nHuang Tingjian passed his teaching credential exam in 1072, and spent the next 7 years teaching at the Damingfu Imperial Academy in Hebei. Its location was in what is currently Daming County. Damingfu was then Northern Capital of the Song Chinese Empire, and not far from the militarily turbulent northern border with the rival Khitan Empire.\n\nIn 1072, Li Chang, his maternal uncle, and Sun Jue his father-in-law had shown examples of Huang Tingjiang's works to the famous poet and New Policy opponent Su Shi (Dongpo). In 1078, Huang presented Su with a letter and two elaborate \"gushi\"-style poems, to which Su returned with two poems of his own, matching Huang's rhyme-scheme. Huang's fame was secured when Su Shi (Dongpo) heaped his praises upon him, and the two became close friends for life.\n\nSo far, it seems that Huang had managed to avoid entanglement in politics, and in fact his early career as an imperial teaching official seems to have been in part secured by the favor of Wang Anshi, upon reading a poem of Huang's, hinting at retiring from the boredom which he was experiencing at that point of his career. At the time, there were two major parties, a \"reform\" party (also known as the New Policies Group), led by Wang Anshi and a \"conservative\" party, which included such prominent officials as Sima Guang, Ouyang Xiu, and Su Shi. Under the imperial system the winning side was chosen by the emperor (or the emperor's regent in the case of his minority). Imperial disfavor could range from death to a stalled career.\n\nAs Emperor Shenzong increasingly favored Wang Anshi's New Policies, as they were known, their opponents suffered politically: this included exile for Su Shi, beginning in 1080, to Hangzhou (which was the time period when Su adopted the nickname of Dongpo). As Su's conviction was for writing in a defamatory way about the emperor and his government, anyone who had circulated his writings without reporting them (as Shen Kuo did), was likely to be found guilty of conspiracy. Both Huang Tingjian and his Uncle Li were convicted as co-conspirators and accordingly given considerable fines (20 catties of copper). Huang was also exiled, first to Jizhou Subprefecture (now Jizhou District, Jiangxi), then to Depingzhen, in Shandong. Like, Su Shi, Huang Tingjian was known for good governance: light with taxes and empathetic with the common folk over whom they were placed in charge. Among other deeds, Huang Tingjian failed to enforce the New Policy of government monopoly of salt production.\n\nThe Yuanyou (, \"Yuányòu\") era (1086–1093) was the first regnal period of the new emperor, Song Zhezong, and an important period in the life of Huang Tingjian. During the Yuanyou years, Zhezong was in his minority, and Empress Dowager Gao acted as regent. Empress Dowager Gao was not a New Policy enthusiast. Wang Anshi's party fell out of favor, and Wang Anshi himself was forced into retirement. Huang Tingjian and the other exiles were recalled from their places of banishment. Happy days were here again: now, Su, Huang, and the others could enjoy each other's company in person, and Huang was promoted, to sub-editor of the Academy of Scholarly Worthies and examining editor for the official records of former Emperor Shenzong's reign. Editing the official records of the previous emperor, in light of the factional politics which had ignited at that time and were still burning, would turn out to be a perilous undertaking for Huang Tingjian's future.\n\nHuang Tingjian's mother died in 1091. Obligatory retirement for a period of mourning in the case of the death of either parent was then the custom, and Huang returned to the family cemetery in Fenning, Jiangnan, with the remains of his mother, his two wives that had died, and those of an aunt. While he was engaged in the three-year ritual mourning period, Empress Dowager Gao died, and Zhezong began to reign in fact as well as name. Zhezong favored the reformist party, and their remnant members returned with a vengeance: their opponents alive or dead were persecuted: Su Shi was demoted and exiled, Sima Guang and Lü Gongzhu's tombs were defaced, and Huang Tingjian was denounced by Cai Bian (Wang Anshi's son-in-law). Huang was convicted of sarcastically editing the official records of former Emperor Shenzong. Huang Tingjian spent the ensuing decade in exile, in various locations in Sichuan.\n\nIn the year 1100, Emperor Zhezong died young and unexpectedly, at 23 years old, and with his death came a new political alignment: the new emperor was Huizong, then in his late teenage years. Much of the power was in the hands of his older brother's wife, the former Empress Xiang. A general amnesty was declared between the two parties, the reformists and, the conservatives. By this time the anti-reformist conservatives were known as the \"Yanyou Party\". Cai Bian and his adherents were dismissed from office. Huang Tingjian found out he had been pardoned, later in the year of 1100. He was also granted a sinecure position in Ezhou city, in southeastern Hubei (responsible for collecting tax revenues on salt), which meant that he received a salary or other remuneration; but, as he was not required to live or work there, this was not exile. However, Huang Tingjian remained in Sichuan long enough to attend his son's marriage ceremony, to the daughter of a local official. In 1102, Huang Tingjian visited Fenning, after extensive travels and several illnesses. As the year 1102 progressed, the political pendulum again reversed itself: the Yuanyou officials were out of favor once more. A list of somewhat over 100 officials whom the emperor considered to be heterodox was erected on a stele at the capital: Huang Tingjian was one of those named. Huang had been the recipient of a major promotion, but was now dismissed summarily, just 9 days after his appointment. As the year 1102 waned, Huang Tingjian returned to Ezhou, and visited various other places including Wuchang. It was during this period that he wrote \"Wind in the Pines Hall\". Huang Tingjian awaited further developments at Ezhou, hearing no news about how the emperor intended to deal with his case, until the end of 1103. It was exile, again. This time to the far south, Yizhou (now in Guangxi). At the time, as now Yizhou, was a fairly small settlement composed of both ethnic Han people and Zhuang people. However, then it was only tenuously part of the Chinese Empire. Guangxi, then administered as Guangnanxi (\"West Southern Expanse\"), had only been annexed by the Song Dynasty in 971. And, as recently as 1052, the Zhuang leader Nong Zhigao had led a revolt, briefly making the area part of an independent kingdom. Sending the then 58-year-old, sick and frail Huang Tingjian to an official exile in this remote and precarious position was not far from a death sentence.\n\nTravel to his remote posting meant passing through the XiaoXiang: the classic poetic place of exile. Not that he was not already there, in Ezhou; but, now, Huang Tingjian was faced with traveling through the depths of it, only to emerge into an even more remote and difficult territory. He faced a fate similar to Su Shi Dongpo, who never quite made it back from his final exile in the then remote and undeveloped island of Hainan. The far southern lands were known as the \"gates of hell\", but when the emperor ordered one of his subjects there, there was little choice. Open resistance could be and often was met with the mass annihilation of ones entire family, and even whole clan. The main hope was a quick recall from exile. However, in Huang Tingjian's case, this never happened.\n\nIn early 1104, Huang Tingjian packed up his family and headed south, towards his place of banishment, Yizhou. That springtime, during the course of his journey, Huang Tingjian met the Chan monk Zhongren (also known as Huaguang, after the name of his monastery). Zhongren shared a scroll of poems by Su Shi, Su Shi's brother Su Che, the monk Shenliao, and Qin Guan (another one of the Yuanyou crew): and, both Su Shi and Qin Guan had died as a result of their exiles in the south, the journey which Huang Tingjian was now upon.\n\nThe two became friends: Zhongren painted branches of flowering plum blossoms and landscapes for Huang, Huang wrote poems in his inimitable calligraphy for Zhongren, even appending a poem with praise of Zhongren to the end of his precious scroll of poems. Together the two helped to change the art world forever: establishing monochrome painting of plums among the scholar-official class.\n\nParting ways with his friend Zhongren, Huang Tingjian headed onward towards his destined place of banishment, Yizhou. Emperor Huizong had ordered him there, and so, leaving his family in the mountains of Yongzhou (Hunan), in order to \"spare them from the intense heat\", Huang Tingjian traveled on to his destination without them.\n\nOnce there, he continued his calligraphy, of which an ink rubbing survives, a rather pointed quote about the life of Fan Pang (137-169), who was arrested and executed due to getting caught up in factional politics, during the second of the Disasters of Partisan Prohibitions which occurred during the Han dynastic era.\n\nIn the early Winter of 1105, Huang Tingjian died, alone from his family, in exile, in Yizhou.\n\nHis funeral was arranged by a stranger, who had traveled to Yizhou, hoping to make his acquaintance.\n\nHuang Tingjian's health was poor throughout his life. His health problems included \"beriberi, severe coughs and colds, malarial fever, headaches, dizziness, and in his later years, heart trouble and chest and arm pains.\" Huang Tingjian also had a deep interest in medicinal substances, and at one point seriously mulled over the idea of giving up his aspirations for an official career, in favor of opening up a shop and dealing in herbs and herbal medications.\n\nHuang Tingjian had 3 wives during his life, and one son, to the third. His first wife was the daughter of the scholar, Sun Jue (1028-1090). She died in 1070. His second wife, from the Xie clan, had a daughter to him, before her death, in Damingfu, in 1079. His third wife gave birth to his only son, whom he gave the unusual name of \"Forty\", because he was 40 years old when the boy was born.\n\nHuang Tingjian had a strong lifelong interest in Buddhism and Daoism. In his hometown of Fenning were 10 monasteries of the Chan practice (\"Chan\" is Chinese for Zen); indeed, Jiangnan had hundreds of them. The year after his second wife died, Huang retreated to the Shan'gu (Mountain Valley) Daoist monastery in Anhui, and took the religious name Shan'gu Daoren.\n\nHuang Tingjian is noted for his prodigious talent in terms of his vast knowledge of Classical Chinese poetry and literature. He is famous both for the calligraphy and the poetry of his work \"Wind in the Pines Hall\", which survives in the Palace Museum, Taipei.\n\nHuang is also regarded as a particularly fine and creative calligrapher of the Song Dynasty. His \"xingshu\" (semi-cursive style of script) displays a sharpness and aggression that is instantly recognizable to students of Chinese calligraphy. His calligraphic piece \"Biographies of Lian Po and Lin Xiangru\" epitomises a technique today known as \"flying-white\" \"when writing calligraphy, the areas within a brushstroke where the brush fails to leave a full measure of ink and streaks of white paper or silk appear\".\n\nHuang Tingjian is considered to be the founder of the Jiangxi school of poetry.\n\n\n\n"}

The settlement has a large modern sawmill with planing. There are many opportunities for fitness trips in the area whether by skiing, riding or on foot.\n\nFrom early on, the settlement had a stave church at Koppanjordet, traces of which still remain. According to legend, the church was taken by a flood and the logs washed ashore in the shape of a cross at Kirkemoen. A new stave church was built on the site, dedicated to Saint Michael. The Røros Line reached Koppang in 1875, the village being served by Koppang Station. From 1877 to 1885, the trains on the line had an overnight stop at Koppang, leading to increased commerce and an expansion of the settlement. From ancient times, people lived in the valley, but repeated flooding caused them to move higher up along its sides. Barns remain at Koppanjordet which have survived many floods. The Old King's Road (\" Gamle Kongevei\") to Trondheim runs through Koppan.

Owned by Ball State University, it is a sister station to National Public Radio (NPR) member WBST (92.1 FM). The two stations share studios at the E. F. Ball Communication Building on the university's campus in northwestern Muncie; WIPB's transmitter is located on County Road 50 in rural southern Delaware County (south of Cowan). On cable, the station is available in standard definition on Comcast Xfinity channel 2 in Muncie and channel 19 in Indianapolis, and in high definition on digital channel 1023 in both cities.\n\nThe UHF channel 49 allocation in Central Indiana was originally occupied by WLBC-TV, which signed on the air on June 14, 1953, as a primary CBS affiliate with secondary affiliations with ABC, NBC and DuMont. The station was founded by Don Burton, owner of Muncie radio station WLBC (1340 AM, now WXFN). During the late 1950s, the station was also briefly affiliated with the NTA Film Network. WLBC-TV dropped CBS programming in the early 1960s, becoming a primary NBC and secondary ABC affiliate. Burton expanded the WLBC radio facility on 29th Street in southeast Muncie and constructed a tower outside the building.\n\nAlthough WLBC served as the NBC and ABC affiliates of record for the Muncie area in the 1960s, the city and surrounding areas received at least Grade B signal coverage from television stations out of Indianapolis, located about southwest of Muncie—including NBC affiliate WFBM-TV (channel 6, now ABC affiliate WRTV), and ABC affiliate WLWI-TV (channel 13, now NBC affiliate WTHR)—as well as stations from Dayton, about to the east, and Fort Wayne, roughly to the north. To make matters worse, WLBC-TV was hampered by low viewership as only a small percentage of Central Indiana area television sets were even capable of receiving UHF stations since set manufacturers were not required to equip televisions with UHF tuners until the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) passed the All-Channel Receiver Act in 1961; even then, UHF tuners were not included on all newer sets until 1964 and the retail prices for standalone UHF tuners at the time were high. The station eventually started a news department in the 1960s.\n\nBurton sold the UHF channel 49 license in 1971 to Eastern Indiana Community Television, a local \"ad hoc\" nonprofit group led by Gretchen Huff and Sunny Spurgeon, which had been working to apply for a license to operate an educational television station in Muncie. The group converted it into a non-commercial educational license, and changed the station's call letters to WIPB (for \"Indiana Public Broadcasting\"). Eastern Indiana Community Television subsequently sold the license to Ball State University, which signed on the station on the afternoon of October 31, 1971 as a PBS member station; as part of PBS' Program Differentiation Plan, the network's programming was divided between it and two other PBS members in the Indianapolis market—WFYI (channel 20) and Bloomington-based WTIU (channel 30); they were joined in 1992 by WTBU in Indianapolis (channel 69, now Daystar owned-and-operated religious station WDTI). WIPB, as a non-commercial outlet, briefly operated a news department during the 1980s, producing a daily newscast titled \"On-Line 49\".\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nWIPB began broadcasting a digital signal on October 31, 2005. The station shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 49, on February 18, 2009, the day after the original target date for full-power television stations in the United States to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (which Congress had moved the previous month to June 12). The station's digital signal continued to broadcast on its pre-transition UHF channel 23. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 49.\n\nFollowing the transition, WIPB decommissioned its original East 29th Street tower that formerly occupied its analog transmitter, which was dismantled in January 2013; its digital signal operates from a separate tower located to its south.\n\nWIPB's claim to fame is having been the station that \"The Joy of Painting\", a half-hour art program hosted by Bob Ross, was recorded at (except for its first season, which was done at WNVC in Falls Church, Virginia) from mid-1983 to 1994. The station also produces \"Connections Live!\", a half-hour weekly magazine program that focuses on the people and places of interest in Central Indiana that connect people to their communities; the program has won four Regional Emmy Awards since 2002.\n\nWIPB's station identifications from the late 1980s utilized the same fanfare used by WPSU-TV (then WPSX) around the same time period. As an example, this ID can be found on older recordings of \"The Joy of Painting\".\n\n"}

In 1863 his family moved from Glasgow to the United States of America, sailing on the \"Cynosure\" and eventually settling in Ogden Valley located in eastern Weber County, Utah. The move was made because of their joining The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and their desire to be near the body of the church. He lived in both Eden and Liberty, Utah.\n\nAfter struggling to make a living, the family moved to Oregon City, Oregon. There they worked in a new mill. He worked for the mill for a year, then for a lumber corporation, and the Oregon and California Railroad. The family moved back to Ogden, Utah in 1869 after the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad hoping it would bring them work.\n\nIn the Ogden area, he worked cutting wood and building homes. He worked as a freighter and for the Union Pacific coal mines. He also worked at a sawmill at Monte Cristo east of Ogden.\n\nIn 1874, he attended Louis F. Moench's school in Ogden. It was there he met Bertha Marie Jensen and married her in 1875. They had 12 children from this marriage.\n\nWhile he had been working he saved up a considerable amount of money and put it to other uses. He started the Eccles Lumber Company and several other enterprises. Through supplying ties for railroads, he knew the local circumstances of where the railroads were building and the opportunities available. He opened lumber mills, shingle mills, planing mills, an electric plant, and other entities. He followed the railroads and opened mills in other locations in Oregon and Washington states. He and his associates built the Sumpter Valley and Mount Hood railroads. It was through these and other railroads that Eccles shipped the lumber and other goods to Utah.\n\nEccles met Ellen Stoddard, the daughter of his partner, John Stoddard. Under the practice of polygamy at the time, David married Ellen, and they made their home in Logan, Utah where he built a lavish yellow brick mansion for his new bride using lumber imported from his corporation in Oregon. (The home is on West Center Street.) Marriner Stoddard Eccles and George S. Eccles are children of this marriage.\n\nEccles was a hard worker. He reported himself to have traveled over in 1904. While friends encouraged him to slow down, he preferred to \"die in the harness.\" One of his hallmarks was integrity and self-reliance. His companies prospered on his no debt plan, and view of achieving success rather than money.\n\nDavid always put his children to work early in life. They worked along with the crews on the railroads, mills, and lumber yards. They were taught as many aspects of the businesses as they were willing to learn. Several went and served missions for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. One son graduated from University of Michigan Law School, another from Columbia University, others from Brigham Young College, Utah State University, and the University of Utah.\n\nWith the estimated 4–7 million dollars he made, mostly from his Oregon enterprises, he invested heavily in Utah. He purchased stock in banks, canneries, insurance companies, railroads, factories, mills, mines, and various other companies. The Utah Construction Company built over of track for the Western Pacific Railroad and led the Six Companies in constructing the Hoover Dam. David Eccles served as the second president of Utah Construction Company after the death of long-term associate Thomas Dee. He also served as founder of a number of companies, one of which was the Amalgamated Sugar Company.\n\nEccles served on the Ogden City Council and as their mayor from 1888 to 1890. He was known for his aid to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for lending large amounts of money to the church at no interest. At the time of his death, he was the president of 16 industrial corporations and 7 banks. He also was serving as a director in 24 other banks and industries. He is Utah's first multimillionaire.\n\nWhile running to catch the evening train from Salt Lake City to Ogden, Utah, he died of a heart attack in Salt Lake City on December 6, 1912 at the age of 63. \n\nThere are a host of organizations named after Eccles and his descendants. The David Eccles School of Business is at the University of Utah. The David Eccles Conference Center is in downtown Ogden, Utah.\nHis relatives in the U.K include Leeds rugby player Graham Eccles.\n\n\n"}

It is shorthand for the aphorism coined in the late 1940s by Theodore Woodward, professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, who instructed his medical interns: \"When you hear hoofbeats, think of horses not zebras\". Since horses are common in Maryland while zebras are relatively rare, logically one could confidently guess that an animal making hoofbeats is probably a horse. By 1960, the aphorism was widely known in medical circles.\n\nAs explained by Sotos, medical novices are predisposed to make rare diagnoses because of (a) the availability heuristic (\"events more easily remembered are judged more probable\") and (b) the phenomenon first enunciated in \"Rhetorica ad Herennium\" (circa 85 BC), \"the striking and the novel stay longer in the mind.\" Thus, the aphorism is an important caution against these biases when teaching medical students to weigh medical evidence.\n\nDiagnosticians have noted, however, that \"zebra\"-type diagnoses must nonetheless be held in mind until the evidence conclusively rules them out:\nThe term for an obscure and rare diagnosis in medicine is fascinoma.\n\nNecrotic skin lesions in the United States are often diagnosed as loxoscelism (recluse spider bites), even in areas where \"Loxosceles\" species are rare or not present. This is a matter of concern because such misdiagnoses can delay correct diagnosis and treatment.\n\nEhlers-Danlos syndrome is considered a rare condition and its sufferers are known as medical zebras. The zebra was adopted across the world as the EDS mascot to bring the patient community together and raise awareness. \n\nThe television series \"Scrubs\" episode \"My Balancing Act\", focuses on this theme, and the medical veteran Dr. Cox uses the metaphor to explain to intern John \"J. D.\" Dorian why he should first consider a simple diagnosis.\n\nThe television series \"House\" had the working title \"Chasing Zebras, Circling the Drain\", a reference to the show's recurring theme of hunting for obscure diagnoses while a patient is in a critical condition. The title character, diagnostic expert Dr. Gregory House rejects the aphorism, arguing that any cases with simple solutions would have been successfully diagnosed by someone else before reaching him. \n\nThe episode of the television series \"\" was named after this term and cites a version of the aphorism in the teaser.\n\nHarvard Medical School and Harvard School of Dental Medicine's 2017 music video \"IT'S NOT A ZEBRA!\" depicts a group of first-year medical students erroneously trying to diagnose a patient with a rare and unlikely disease, when in fact she has the flu.\n\nIn The Expanse (novel series)'s fourth book Nemesis Games, Captain James Holden suggests Monica Stuart is \".. starting a unicorn hunt. \" when summarising an unspecified joke based on the aphorism.\n\n\n\n"}

As of 2020, the school serves northern portions of Mesquite and the MISD portion of Garland. Formerly, North Mesquite served all of Sunnyvale, before the completion of Sunnyvale High School, leaving the class of 2010 the last North Mesquite class catering to Sunnyvale students.\n\nNorth Mesquite serves grades 9 through 12. The total enrollment in 2002 was 2450; the school is therefore under the UIL AAAAAA (or 6A) division. According to the MISD Report Card, the per student expenditure for the same 2002 period was 2700 USD. The stallion is the school mascot and the school colors are blue and white. The school's motto is Animus Omnia Vincit, which translates from the Latin as \"Courage Conquers All.\"\nNorth Mesquite High School opened in September 1969 as the second high school in Mesquite ISD, behind Mesquite High School, the school's rival in athletic competitions. The original construction consisted of four floors: A, B, C, and D. Over several decades, the enrollment expanded in accordance with the population swell that took place in Mesquite and Sunnyvale, demanding supplementary facilities. In the 1990s, a new gym was constructed. F wing and E section opened for the 2002-2003 school year providing twenty new general classrooms as well as a new Band, Orchestra, and Choir hall. During the 2008-2009 school year construction on S wing (Science wing) began, and opened for the 2009-2010 school year providing 8 Labs and 16 science classrooms. With the science wing being added, the existing rooms on A floor were renovated and added new classrooms. The front of the school was renovated; a new entrance was created, and the business office was enlarged and renovated. The cafeteria was enlarged and snack lines were added. In September 2018 a statue of the school’s mascot, a Stallion, was placed inside the building right at the entrance.\n\nNorth Mesquite serves northern portions of the city of Mesquite and the students in the MISD portion of southern Garland.\n\nFormerly, the school also served all high school students living in Sunnyvale. However, in an election on May 12, 2007, Sunnyvale residents passed a bond creating Sunnyvale High School. From the 2007-2008 school year, ninth grade students in Sunnyvale were housed in Sunnyvale Middle School for two years, until the construction of the high school was complete. Beginning in the 2009-2010 school year, students attended classes at the actual SHS campus. One grade was added consecutively to the high school, making the class of 2010 the last North Mesquite class that catered to Sunnyvale students. Thomas Korosec of \"D Magazine\" implied that changing racial demographics at North Mesquite may have motivated the Sunnyvale district to build its own high school.\n\nBy the 2010s most of the students were Hispanic/Latino and African-American.\n\nAll students in North Mesquite are required to dress according to a standardized dress code (similar to a school uniform) as of 2005; the code is used in all Mesquite ISD middle schools, high schools and 5th and 6th grades. See this link for more information about Standard Dress \n\nMesquite ISD elementary schools that feed into North Mesquite include all of Florence, Lawrence, McKenzie, Motley, Price, Range, Rugel, Shands, and Tosch.\n\nPart of McDonald Middle School and all of Vanston Middle School in Mesquite ISD feed into North Mesquite. (The other alumni of McDonald feed into West Mesquite High School.)\n\nNorth Mesquite's rival is Mesquite High School. The rivalry dates back to when North Mesquite was founded in 1969. The school was the first to split from Mesquite High, which was then the only high school in the city, and thus the rivalry started.\n\nThe North Mesquite Band, known as the Big Blue Band(BBB for short), was started with the opening of the school in 1969. In recent years Big Blue has relatively gotten attention in East Texas as one of the better bands. Big Blue had its best year in 2012 with its show entitled \"Immortal\". Under the direction of Jeffery D Jones, Big Blue started the season big as they wowed the crowd at The Mesquite Marching Competition. At their next competition, The Classic on the Lake hosted in Little Elm Texas, Big Blue earned its bragging rights. Ending in 3rd in Prelims, the band went to finish in 2nd place in finals placing behind Sherman High. At the UIL Big Blue got straight ones, advancing them to the Area C Marching Competition. At their final Performance North ended their season there with a heart breaking loss. Of the twenty so schools there, North ended in 5th, one spot below the 4 bands that would continue to state. Losing to Rowlett, Duncanville, Coppell, and Berkner High, North waits for 2014, hoping to be one of those 4 bands, heading to their first State Marching Competition.\n\n\n\n"}

He played in numerous films following his debut in 1940, then went to New York City and appeared on Broadway, winning two New York Drama Critics' Circle Awards for his supporting roles in \"The Madwoman of Chaillot\" and \"Detective Story\". He then returned to Hollywood and made more than 40 more films. Westerfield maintained an interest in the theater.\n\nHe directed more than 50 musicals in a summer-musical tent he owned in Danbury, Connecticut, and was the original stage director and producer for the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles.

The operation was staged in June 1942 and was to be directed against strategic American economic targets. The operation was named by Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, chief of the German \"Abwehr\", for Francis Daniel Pastorius, the leader of the first organized settlement of Germans in America.\n\nAfter the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, followed by Nazi Germany's declaration of war on the United States four days later (and the United States' declaration of war on Germany in response), Hitler authorized a mission to sabotage the American war effort and attack civilian targets to demoralize the American civilian population inside the United States. The mission was headed by Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, chief of the German \"Abwehr\". Canaris recalled that during World War I, he organized the sabotage of French installations in Morocco, and entered the United States with other German agents to plant bombs in New York arms factories, including the destruction of munitions supplies at Black Tom Island, in 1916. He hoped that Operation Pastorius would have the same kind of success they had in 1916.\n\nRecruited for Operation Pastorius were eight German residents who had lived in the United States. Two of them, Ernst Burger and Herbert Haupt, were American citizens. The others, George John Dasch, Edward John Kerling, Richard Quirin, Heinrich Harm Heinck, Hermann Otto Neubauer, and Werner Thiel, had worked at various jobs in the United States. All eight were recruited into the \"Abwehr\" military intelligence organization and were given three weeks of intensive sabotage training in the German High Command school on an estate at Quenz Lake, near Berlin, Germany. The agents were instructed in the manufacture and use of explosives, incendiaries, primers, and various forms of mechanical, chemical, and electrical delayed timing devices. Considerable time was spent developing complete background \"histories\" they were to use in the United States. They were encouraged to converse in English and to read American newspapers and magazines to hone their English and familiarity with current American events and culture.\n\nTheir mission was to stage sabotage attacks on American economic targets: hydroelectric plants at Niagara Falls; the Aluminum Company of America's plants in Illinois, Tennessee, and New York; locks on the Ohio River near Louisville, Kentucky; the Horseshoe Curve, a crucial railroad pass near Altoona, Pennsylvania, as well as the Pennsylvania Railroad's repair shops at Altoona; a cryolite plant in Philadelphia; Hell Gate Bridge in New York; and Pennsylvania Station in Newark, New Jersey. The agents were also instructed to spread a wave of terror by planting explosives on bridges, railroad stations, water facilities, and public places. They were given counterfeit birth certificates, Social Security Cards, draft deferment cards, nearly $175,000 in American money, and driver's licenses, and put aboard two U-boats to land on the east coast of the U.S.\n\nBefore the mission began, it was in danger of being compromised, as George Dasch, head of the team, left sensitive documents behind on a train, and one of the agents when drunk announced to patrons at a bar in Paris that he was a secret agent.\n\nOn the night of June 12, 1942, the first submarine to arrive in the U.S., , landed at Amagansett, New York, which is about 100 miles east of New York City, on Long Island, at what today is Atlantic Avenue beach. It was carrying Dasch and three other saboteurs (Burger, Quirin, and Heinck). The team came ashore wearing German Navy uniforms so that if they were captured, they would be classified as prisoners of war rather than spies. They also brought their explosives, primers and incendiaries, and buried them along with their uniforms, and put on civilian clothes to begin an expected two-year campaign in the sabotage of American defense-related production.\n\nWhen Dasch was discovered amidst the dunes by unarmed Coast Guardsman John C. Cullen, Dasch offered Cullen a $260 bribe. Cullen feigned cooperation but reported the encounter. An armed patrol returned to the site but found only the buried equipment; the Germans had taken the Long Island Rail Road from the Amagansett station into Manhattan, where they checked into a hotel. A massive manhunt was begun.\n\nThe other four-member German team headed by Kerling landed without incident at Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, south of Jacksonville on June 16, 1942. They came on , another submarine. This group came ashore wearing bathing suits but wore German Navy hats. After landing ashore, they threw away their hats, put on civilian clothes, and started their mission by boarding trains to Chicago, Illinois and Cincinnati, Ohio.\n\nThe two teams were to meet on July 4 in a hotel in Cincinnati to coordinate their sabotage operations.\n\nDasch called Burger into their upper-story hotel room and opened a window, saying they would talk, and if they disagreed, \"only one of us will walk out that door—the other will fly out this window.\" Dasch told him he had no intention of going through with the mission, hated Nazism, and planned to report the plot to the FBI. Burger agreed to defect to the United States immediately.\n\nOn June 15, Dasch phoned the New York office of the FBI to explain who he was, but hung up when the agent answering doubted his story. Four days later, he took a train to Washington, DC and walked into FBI headquarters, where he gained the attention of Assistant Director D.M. Ladd by showing him the operation's budget of $84,000 cash. Besides Burger, none of the other German agents knew they were betrayed. Over the next two weeks, Burger and the other six were arrested. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover made no mention that Dasch had turned himself in, and claimed credit for the FBI for cracking the spy ring.\n\nFearful that a civilian court would be too lenient, President Roosevelt issued Executive Proclamation 2561 on July 2, 1942 creating a military tribunal to prosecute the Germans. Placed before a seven-member military commission, the Germans were charged with the following offenses:\n\nThe trial was held in Assembly Hall #1 on the fifth floor of the Department of Justice building in Washington D.C. on July 8, 1942. Lawyers for the accused, who included Lauson Stone and Kenneth Royall, attempted to have the case tried in a civilian court but were rebuffed by the United States Supreme Court in \"Ex parte Quirin\", 317 U.S. 1 (1942), a case that was later cited as a precedent for the trial by military commission of any unlawful combatant against the United States.\n\nThe trial for the eight defendants ended on August 1, 1942. Two days later, all were found guilty and sentenced to death. Roosevelt commuted Burger's sentence to life in prison and Dasch's to 30 years because they had turned themselves in and provided information about the others. The others were executed on August 8, 1942 in the electric chair on the third floor of the District of Columbia jail and buried in a potter's field in the Blue Plains neighborhood in the Anacostia area of Washington.\n\nThe failure of Operation Pastorius led Hitler to rebuke Admiral Canaris and no sabotage attempt was ever made again in the United States. During the remaining years of the war, the Germans only once more dispatched agents to the United States by submarine. In November 1944, as part of Operation Elster, the German submarine \"U-1230\" dropped two RSHA spies off the coast of Maine to gather intelligence on American manufacturing and technical progress. The FBI captured both men shortly after. These agents benefited from the calmer state of public nerves in the later years of the war and received prison sentences rather than execution.\n\nIn 1948, President Harry S. Truman granted executive clemency to Dasch and Burger on the condition that they be deported to the American Zone of occupied Germany. They were not welcomed back in Germany, as they were regarded as traitors who had caused the death of their comrades. Although they had been promised pardons by Hoover in exchange for their cooperation, both men died without ever receiving them. Dasch died in 1992 at the age of 89 in Ludwigshafen, Germany. Burger died in 1975.\n\nSometime in the 1960s or 1970s, the National Socialist White People's Party placed an unauthorized monument to the executed spies in a thicket in southwest Washington, D.C. on National Park Service land. It went largely unknown and ignored for several decades; the Park Service removed it in 2010.\n\n\n\n\nFurther information\n\n"}

{"id": "2295002", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2295002", "title": "Wim Jonk", "text": "Wim Jonk\n\nWilhelmus Maria \"Wim\" Jonk (born 12 October 1966) is a Dutch football coach, former international player and former Head of Academy at Ajax Amsterdam. Together with Jordi Cruyff, Jonk manages Cruyff Football and is responsible for the worldwide continuation and dissemination of the football legacy of Dutch football legend Johan Cruyff, who died on 24 March 2016. Jonk is the trainer of FC Volendam for the season 2019/2020, the club where Jonk started his career as football player. FC Volendam currently plays in the Eerste Divisie.\n\nBorn in Volendam, Jonk started his career in amateur club RKAV Volendam, before signing for Volendam in 1986. As a central midfield player, he scored many goals, assisting his club to promotion to the Eredivisie in 1987, where he scored a further of five goals. Ajax monitored his progress keenly and his skills did not escape the scouts of the club, who hastened his transfer to Amsterdam in 1988.\n\nAt Ajax, he slotted into the squad easily, even scoring 6 goals in his debut season. First team chances were regular, if not abundant, but his first appearance for the Dutch national team seemed a long way away. His gameplay is not very artistic, but he has earned a reputation as a midfield anchor in the same mould as other Dutch players like Aron Winter, Erwin Koeman, Philip Cocu, Mark van Bommel and Kevin Strootman. Therefore, with the Dutch 1990 World Cup squad brimming with attack-minded midfielders like Richard Witschge and Jan Wouters, he was unsurprisingly omitted from selection for the national team in the late 1980s as well as the 1990 World Cup squad. He helped Ajax to the 1992 UEFA Cup Final in which he scored to help them overcome Torino.\n\nHis pin-point passing, outstanding vision and combative and hard-working style of play earned him his debut for the Dutch national team in a 3–2 win in a friendly against Austria on 27 May 1992 and he signed on for Internazionale in 1993 before the 1994 World Cup, where he was joined by compatriot Dennis Bergkamp. The Italian club had seemingly followed their illustrious city rivals Milan into buying Dutch players in the hope to emulate Milan's success with Marco van Basten, Frank Rijkaard and Ruud Gullit in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nThe Dutch 1994 World Cup squad selected by then coach Dick Advocaat had been tipped to reach the quarter-finals of the tournament and Advocaat had opted for a central midfield pairing of Jonk and usually Jan Wouters or Rob Witschge, supported by speedy wingers such as Marc Overmars and Bryan Roy. In the first group game against Saudi Arabia, the Netherlands fell behind to a goal by Saudi player Fuad Amin in the 19th minute of the match before Jonk opened his World Cup scoring account by netting a 50th minute long-range effort from a good 35 metres out. Though the keeper could have saved the shot, it went in nonetheless, and the goal became one of the most spectacular of the tournament.\nThe Dutch went on to win the match by a goal from Gaston Taument in the 86th minute. Jonk would score another goal against the Republic of Ireland from another long-range effort and a goalkeeping blunder, in a convincing 2–0 win to help the Dutch qualify for a quarter-final meeting with Brazil.\n\nMeanwhile, at Internazionale, he managed 54 appearances in two seasons and scored eight goals. He scored in a UEFA Cup Final again, this time as Internazionale won the 1994 final. However, when teammate Dennis Bergkamp left Internazionale for Arsenal at the end of the 1994–95 season, he felt that opportunities for a first team place at the Italian club seemed to be under threat (he was by then close to being 30 years old) and he went back to the Netherlands to sign with PSV. He stayed long enough at PSV to convince then manager Guus Hiddink to be selected for the 1998 World Cup in France, after being overlooked for Euro 1996. At the 1998 World Cup, Jonk played in five of the seven matches that the Netherlands played and did not score any goals.\n\nWith the appointment of Frank Rijkaard as the new manager after the 1998 World Cup, Jonk's international career seemed to be over. However, he did play once more for the Netherlands in a friendly against Denmark on 18 August 1999. Jonk finished his international career on 49 caps and 11 goals.\n\nFor the 1998–99 season, Jonk went to join Sheffield Wednesday for a fee of £2.5 million, where he was a regular starter for the relegation-threatened side. Apparently, his once-impressive performances for both club and country had gone and he was frequently injured, which caused the Wednesday fans to voice dissent about a clause in his contract which stipulated that he would automatically receive £5,000 per game which he would miss through injury. At the beginning of the 2000–01 season, he announced his retirement from the game.\n\nAfter his career as a player, Jonk featured as a TV football analyst on NOS Studio Sport, before returning to his first love FC Volendam as the board member for technical affairs. In this role Jonk also worked as an individual trainer and assistant to the first and second team of FC Volendam.\n\nBetween 2008 until November 2015, Jonk worked for Ajax Amsterdam. First as an individual technical skills trainer (2008 – 2011), later as the Head of Academy and member of the Technical Heart (2011 – 2015). In 2010, Jonk, Johan Cruyff and Ruben Jongkind wrote the Plan Cruyff which led to the so-called ‘velvet revolution’. In 2011, the Plan Cruyff was officially adopted as the new Ajax club policy. One of its core pillars was the fundamental reform of the Ajax youth academy, based on an individual approach in talent development. In concert with Cruyff as an advisor and Ruben Jongkind as Head of Talent Development, Jonk implemented this innovative vision between 2012 and 2015, sparking a rebirth of the academy including a new organisational structure and culture. During his time as Head of Academy, Jonk was a coach of a various Ajax youth teams, including Ajax Under 19.\nAfter ongoing disagreement between Jonk and Cruyff with the board of directors, about the interpretation and lack of implementation of the Plan Cruyff at the first team and in the overall club policy, Jonk left the club in December 2015, together with Johan Cruyff and a large group of key academy personnel.\n\nAs of September 2016, Jonk and Jordi Cruyff co-manage and lead the Amsterdam-based international football institute Cruyff Football. Cruyff Football, the official heir of the football legacy of Johan Cruyff, is responsible for managing, protecting, sharing, developing and implementing the Cruyff football vision and talent development philosophy worldwide, at both professional football clubs and national football federations.\n\nAjax\n\nInternazionale\n\nPSV\n"}

It is the first book in the Dollanganger Series, and was followed by \"Petals on the Wind\", \"If There Be Thorns\", \"Seeds of Yesterday\", \"Garden of Shadows\", \"\", \"\" and \"\". The novel is written in the first-person, from the point of view of Cathy Dollanganger. It was twice adapted into films in 1987 and 2014. The book was extremely popular, selling over forty million copies world-wide. \n\nIn 1957, the Dollanganger family lives an idyllic life in Gladstone, Pennsylvania until Mr. Dollanganger dies in a car accident, leaving his wife Corinne deep in debt with four children and no professional skills. The family is forced to move in with Corinne's wealthy parents, from whom she is estranged. Upon arrival at Corinne's ancestral home, Foxworth Hall, the family is greeted coldly by Corinne's mother Olivia, who sneaks them into a small bedroom connected to the attic. The children are told they must remain hidden from their grandfather, Malcolm, and can never leave this room.\n\nThe older children, Cathy and Chris, attempt to make the best of the situation for their younger siblings, twins Carrie and Cory, by turning the attic into an imaginary garden. They are dismayed when Corinne returns after meeting with her parents and they see she has been savagely whipped. Corinne confesses that the children's dead father was her father's half-brother, and this incest is the cause of her and her parents' estrangement. Corinne plans to win back her father's love, and hopes to introduce the children once this has been accomplished.\n\nAt first, Corinne visits her children daily, sometimes bringing expensive gifts. Meanwhile, Olivia emotionally and physically abuses the children, constantly threatening to whip them for any acts she considers \"sinful\". At Christmas time, Corinne allows Cathy and Chris to watch guests at Foxworth Hall from a hiding spot, where they see their grandfather for the first time and also see their mother with Bart Winslow, Malcolm's attorney. Their mother's visits then become less frequent as her emotional bond with the children weakens, to the point where she eventually slaps Chris and threatens to whip him.\n\nA year later, Cathy and Chris have both entered puberty and become surrogate parents for Carrie and Cory, who no longer recognize Corinne when she occasionally appears. While Cathy and Chris are both entering adulthood, the twins' physical growth is stunted from a lack of adequate nutrition, sunlight and fresh air. Despite personal shame, Cathy and Chris develop a physical attraction toward each other. Olivia catches Chris staring at a half-dressed Cathy and orders him to cut off Cathy's hair. Chris refuses, and Olivia abandons them for three weeks, driving them to near-starvation. When Cathy cuts her own hair, meals resume and now include sugared doughnuts as a surprise.\n\nCorinne visits the children for the first time in six months, explaining that she had been on honeymoon with Bart in Europe. Cathy and Chris react angrily, but when Corinne threatens to never visit again, they pretend to be happy for her. Realising that they cannot rely on their mother any longer, Chris and Cathy come up with an escape plan, sneaking into the house to steal money and valuables from their mother's room. One night, Cathy discovers her sleeping stepfather and kisses him. When Chris learns of the act, he is enraged and rapes Cathy. Afterwards, he is overcome with remorse, and Cathy forgives him by saying she wanted it too.\n\nCory becomes very sick and Corinne agrees to take him to the hospital, though only after Cathy tells her that if Cory dies, she will find a way to make Corinne pay for it. The next day, Corinne returns and tells the children that Cory died, allegedly from pneumonia. Without warning, their mother and Bart move out. Eavesdropping on the servants, Chris learns that Malcolm died months ago and Olivia is now leaving out doughnuts sprinkled with rat poison in an attempt to clear the attic's \"mouse\" infestation. The three remaining children finally flee, catching a train to Florida.\n\nAt the train station, Chris reveals he discovered Corinne's inheritance is conditional on her having no descendants from her first marriage, and she was poisoning them to secure her father's wealth. Chris and Cathy decide against contacting the police as their main concern is to stay together and protect Carrie, who is still a minor. Chris assures Cathy that they can make a new life without their mother, but Cathy swears to exact revenge one day.\n\n\nIn 1993, \"Flowers in the Attic\" was awarded the Secondary BILBY Award. In 2003 the book was listed on the BBC's The Big Read poll of the UK's 200 \"best-loved novels.\"\n\nIn 1987, the book was adapted into a film of the same name starring Louise Fletcher, Victoria Tennant, Kristy Swanson, and Jeb Stuart Adams and directed by Jeffrey Bloom.\n\nA second adaptation was released on January 18, 2014, on the Lifetime network starring Heather Graham as Corrine and Ellen Burstyn as the Grandmother, with Kiernan Shipka as Cathy, Mason Dye as Christopher, and directed by Deborah Chow. The film received mixed reviews, but critics praised Ellen Burstyn's performance.\n\nThe book was adapted into a stage play by V. C. Andrews's ghost writer, Andrew Neiderman, in the form of an e-book and was published by Pocket Star. The stage play was released in October 2014 and is 80 pages in length. In August 2015 the stage play received its world premiere production in New Orleans, Louisiana. The play, which received positive reviews, was produced by and was directed by Christopher Bentivegna.\n\nThe book's success was not without controversy. The depiction of incest between an adolescent brother and sister in the novel has led to its being banned in certain areas at different times. Chariho High School in Rhode Island removed it because it contained \"offensive passages concerning incest and sexual intercourse.\" In 1994, it was removed from the Oconee County, Georgia school libraries due to \"the filthiness of the material.\"\n\nClaims that the novel is based on a true story have been disputed. For many years, there was no evidence to support this claim, and the book was passed off as fiction. Nonetheless, the official V. C. Andrews website claims to have contacted one of Andrews' relatives. This unidentified relative claimed \"Flowers in the Attic\" was loosely based on a faintly similar account. While at the \"University of Virginia hospital for treatment...she developed a crush on her young doctor. He and his siblings had been locked away in the attic for over 6 years to preserve the family wealth.\"\n"}

The mountain forms a ridge, terminating in what was known anciently as the Trogilium promontory (Ancient Greek Τρωγίλιον or Τρωγύλιον). There are several beaches on the north shore ranging from sand to pebbles. The south flank is mainly escarpment.\n\nIn classical Greece nearly the entire ridge was a promontory enclosed by the Aegean Sea. Geopolitically it was part of Ionia with Priene placed on the coast on the south flank of the mountain and Miletus on the coast opposite to the south across the deep embayment into which the Maeander River drained. Somewhat further north was Ephesus.\n\nThe ruins of the first two Ionian cities mentioned with their harbor facilities remain but today are several miles inland overlooking instead a rich agricultural plain and delta parkland created by deposition of sediments from the river, which continues to form the geological feature named after it, maeanders. The end of the former bay remains as a lake, Çamiçi Gölü (Lake Bafa). Samsun Daği does retain a promontory.\n\nThe entire ridge was made into a national park of , Dilek Yarimadisi Milli Parki (\"Dilek Peninsula National Park\") in 1966, which is in part accessible to the public. The remainder is a military reservation. The park's isolation has encouraged the return of the native ecology, which is 60% maquis. It is a refuge for species that used to be more abundant in the region.\n\nWestern Turkey is mainly fault-block terrain with steep-sided ridges running east-west and rivers in the rifts. The source of the faulting is the closing of Tethys Sea and the collision of the African and Arabian plates with the Eurasian plate. The smaller Turkish and Aegean plates are being pushed together, generating ridges in Turkey. This orogenic belt was in place by 1.6 mya and continues to be a hot spot of earthquakes and volcanos.\n\nMount Mycale is part of a larger ridge, which continues in Samos on the other side of the Samos Strait, and to the northeast in the Aydin Dağlari (\"Aydin Mountains\"), ancient Messogis range, on the other side of low hills and passes. The entire block of mountains around the Menderes (Maeander) River is the Menderes Massif.\n\nMycale is scored transversely by numerous ravines through which sources drain. The biggest ravine is Oluk Gorge, with cliffs high. The main permanent streams are the Bal Deresi, the Sarap Dami and the Oluk Dereleri. The ample water supply supports a verdant maquis.\n\nThe rock is primarily metamorphic: marble and limestone formed from rocks originating in the Mesozoic,crystalline schists formed from rocks originating in the Palaeozoic and conglomerates of the Cenozoic. These materials were not wasted on the renowned builders and sculptors of Ionia.\n\nThe ridge and its environs offer a number of different ecologies. The crest is a sharp divide between the xerophytic southern slopes and the forested northern slopes, with of maquis and of mixed pine.\nAround the base of the promontory is a maritime environment.\n\nThe maquis vegetation includes \"Pistacia lentiscus; Laurus nobilis; Quercus ilex, Q. frainetto\" and \"Q. ithaburensis; Phillyrea latifolia; Ceratonia siliqua; Olea europaea; Rubus fruticosus; Myrtus communis; Smilax; Jasminum fruticans; Vitex vivifera; Lathyrus grandiflorus; Erica arborea;\" and \"Juncus\" on the slopes of the north. In moister areas are to be found \"Nerium oleander, Platanus orientalis, Fraxinus ornus, Laurus nobilis, Cupressus sempervirens\" and \"Rubus fruticosus\".\n\nThe mixed pine forest goes up to . Its major plant species are Pinus brutia, Juniperus phoenicea, with broad-leaved trees and shrubs: Ulmus campestris, Acer sempervirens, Fraxinus ornus, Castanea sativa, Tilia platyphyllos, Sorbus torminalis, Viburnum tinus, Pyrus eleagrifolia and Prunus dulcis.\n\nSome mammals native to the region are Sus scrofa, Vulpes vulpes, Hystrix cristata, Canis aureus, Canis lupus, Martes martes, Lynx lynx, Felis sylvestris, Ursus arctos, Meles meles, Lepus, Erinaceus europaeus and Sciurus. Migrants are Lynx caracal and Panthera pardus.\n\nSome birds are Columba livia, Alectoris graeca, Perdix perdix, Coturnix coturnix, Scolopax rusticola, Turdus merula, Turdus pilaris, Oriolus oriolus, Merops apiaster, eagles, vultures, Corvus corax, Pica pica and Sturnus vulgaris.\n\nMonachus monachus breeds in caves around the shores of Mycale. They and other marine predators (including man) feed on Liza, Pagellus, Dentex vulgaris and Thunnus thynnus.\n\nMycale, Miletus and the Maeander appear in the Trojan Battle Order of the Iliad, where they are populated by Carians. \"The steep heights of Mycale\" and Miletus are also in the \"Hymn to Apollo\", where Leto, pregnant with Apollo, an especially Ionian god, travels about the Aegean looking for a home for her son, and settles on Delos, the major Ionian political, religious and cultural center of Classical Greece.\n\nA similar metaphor is to be found in the centuries-later \"Hymn to Delos\" of Callimachus, in which Delos, a swimming island, visits various places in the Aegean, including Parthenia, \"Maiden's Isle\" (Samos), where it is entertained by the nymphs of Mycalessos. Just as Parthenia is the previous name of Samos so the reader is to understand Mycalessos as the previous name of Mycale. On being chosen as the birthplace of Apollo, Delos becomes fixed in the sea.\n\nThere are no earlier instances of Mycale but some major Creto-Mycenan cities, later Ionian, which appear in Mycenaean Greek and Hittite records of the Late Bronze Age. In Hitti language, there were the Achaean-Greek cities Apasa (Ephesus), the capital of a state called Arzawa, in which also was Karkisha in (Caria) and Millawanda (Miletus). In the Linear B script tablets the region is called A-swi-ja (Asia). Documents at Pylos, Thebes and Knossos identify female textile workers and seamstresses (raptria)in servitude of Mi-ra-ti-ja, *Milātiai, \"Milesians.\" The regions from which they came were centers of Mycenaean civilization although the languages they spoke was an early Greek-Mycenaean language and written in Linear B, although some support that was an unknown.\nAfter the Late Bronze Age the entire Aegean region entered a historical period termed the Greek Dark Ages. Archaeologically it was known as the Proto-geometric and Geometric Periods, which did not belong to any one ethnic group. This is the time to which heavy Ionic migration from mainland Greece to the coast of Ionia and the emergence of Delos as an Ionian center is believed to apply. These events were over at the start of the brilliant renaissance of the Orientalizing Period in which Ionia played a cardinal role.\n\nDuring this rise to prominence twelve cities were settled or resettled and emerged as Ionia speaking varieties of Ionic Greek. Vitruvius, however, says there were thirteen, the extra state being Melite, which \"... as a punishment of the arrogance of its citizens was detached from the other states in a war levied pursuant to the directions of a general council (\"communi consilio\"); and in its place ... the city of Smyrna was admitted into the number of Ionian states (\"inter Ionas est recepta\").\" There is no other mention of Melite anywhere but two fragments of Hecataeus say that Melia was a city of Caria and an inscription from Priene confirms that there had been a \"Meliac War\" against a state located between Priene and Samos; i.e., on Mycale.\n\nThe inscription records the result of an arbitration between Priene and Samos by jurors from Rhodes. Both litigants claimed that Carium, the fortified settlement of Melia, and Dryussa, another settlement, had been distributed to them at the conclusion of the Meliac War, when the Carians were expelled. Being on the Samian side of the crest Melia had been resettled mainly by Samians and for this reason they had won a similar case brought before Lysimachus of Macedon a century earlier. That case is mentioned in an earlier inscription from Priene.\n\nPriene had now reopened the case arguing that their sale of plots from the land demonstrated their continuous ownership of it except for a brief period when an invasion of the Cimmerians under Lygdamus forced temporary Greek evacuation of the region (about 650 BC). The Samians used a passage from the now missing \"History\" of Maeandrius of Miletus to support their claim. The jury found that Maeandrius was not authentic and reversed the earlier decision.\n\nThe Melians had named their capital Carium, \"of Caria\" as a Greek word. Considering that it was placed in Ionia, the choice of name suggests a political statement of some sort, although the word may have had a different meaning in the Carian language, now lost except for a few dozen words. The Ionians leagued together to defeat it and continued the league, building a capital they called Panionium, \"of all the Ionians\" next to the former Carium. It rose to prominence while the Ionian confederacy was sovereign, became a memory when Ionia was incorporated into other states and empires and finally was lost altogether. The ancient writers remembered that it had been on the north side of the mountain, across the ridge from Priene.\n\nAfter a few false identifications in modern times, the ruins of Melia and the Panionium were discovered in 2004 on Dilek Daglari, a smaller peak of Mycale, to the north of Priene at an elevation of . The Carium must be the early 7th century BC town surrounded by a triangular wall in places as thick as .\n\nThe floruit was the early 7th, but sherds have been found there from as early as the Protogeometric period. Coldstream characterizes the burial structures as of \"a considerable Carian substrate.\" The culture was not entirely Carian; the Ionians continued the worship of Poseidon Heliconius there, which Strabo says came from Helike in Peloponnesian Achaea. This event must have been during the Ionian colonization. Melia therefore was a renegade Ionian state.\n\nThe temple believed to the Panionium was constructed next to the Carium about 540 BC. It took over the worship of Poseidon Heliconius, served as the meeting place of the Ionian League, and was the site of the religious festival and games (\"panegyris\") called the Panionia. The construction of this temple is a terminus post quem for the existence of the Ionian League, which as a constituted body had a name, the \"koinon Iōnōn\" (\"common thing of the Ionians\"), a \"synedrion\" (\"place to sit down together\") and a \"boulē\" (\"council\").\n\nWhether this body existed before the Meliac War is uncertain. Vitruvius' \"commune consilium\" seems to translate \"koinon.\" Some analysts have postulated an association as early as 800 BC but whether formally constituted remains unknown. There is no sign of it yet on Mycale unless Carium had in fact been it.\n\nIn 479 BC, Mycale was the site of one of the two major battles that ended the second Persian invasion of Greece, during the Greco-Persian Wars. Under the leadership of the Spartan Leotychides, the Greek fleet defeated the Persian fleet and army. According to Herodotus, the battle occurred the same day as the Greek victory at Plataea.\n\n\n"}

The story is narrated by Masha. After a courtship that has the trappings of a mere family friendship, Masha's love grows and expands until she can no longer contain it. She reveals it to Sergey Mikhaylych and discovers that he also is deeply in love. If he has resisted her it was because of his fear that the age difference between them would lead the very young Masha to tire of him. He likes to be still and quiet, he tells her, while she will want to explore and discover more and more about life. Ecstatically and passionately happy, the pair immediately engages to be married. Once married they move to Mikhaylych's home. They are both members of the landed Russian upper class. Masha soon feels impatient with the quiet order of life on the estate, notwithstanding the powerful understanding and love that remains between the two. To assuage her anxiety, they decide to spend a few weeks in St. Petersburg. Sergey Mikhaylych agrees to take Masha to an aristocratic ball. He hates \"society\" but she is enchanted with it. They go again, and then again. She becomes a regular, the darling of the countesses and princes, with her rural charm and her beauty. Sergey Mikhaylych, at first very pleased with Petersburg society's enthusiasm for his wife, frowns on her passion for \"society\"; but he does not try to influence Masha. Out of respect for her, Sergey Mikhaylych will scrupulously allow his young wife to discover the truth about the emptiness and ugliness of \"society\" on her own. But his trust in her is damaged as he watches how dazzled she is by this world. Finally they confront each other about their differences. They argue but do not treat their conflict as something that can be resolved through negotiation. Both are shocked and mortified that their intense love has suddenly been called into question. Something has changed. Because of pride, they both refuse to talk about it. The trust and the closeness are gone. Only courteous friendship remains. Masha yearns to return to the passionate closeness they had known before Petersburg. They go back to the country. Though she gives birth to children and the couple has a good life, she despairs. They can barely be together by themselves. Finally she asks him to explain why he did not try to guide and direct her away from the balls and the parties in Petersburg. Why did they lose their intense love? Why don't they try to bring it back? His answer is not the answer she wants to hear, but it settles her down and prepares her for a long life of comfortable \"Family Happiness\". \n\nA passage of the book is quoted in the book and film \"Into the Wild\":\n\n\"I have lived through much, and now I think I have found what is needed for happiness. A quiet secluded life in the country, with the possibility of being useful to people to whom it is easy to do good, and who are not accustomed to have it done to them; then work which one hopes may be of some use; then rest, nature, books, music, love for one's neighbor—such is my idea of happiness. And then, on top of all that, you for a mate, and children perhaps—what more can the heart of man desire?\"\n\nAnother passage is also quoted in the book \"Into the Wild\":\n\nThe last page of the story is also quoted in full in the Philip Roth novel \"The Counterlife\".\n\nThe Mountain Goats song \"Family Happiness\" takes its name from the novella and includes the line \"Started quoting Tolstoy into the machine/I had no idea what you meant\".\n\nTheater Atelier Piotr Fomenko in Moscow adapted the novella to the stage.

It was developed by Midway Studios Austin and published by Midway for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Microsoft Windows, silently canceled for Nintendo GameCube. It is a loose remake of the 1995 light gun video game of the same name, and was followed in 2007 by the loosely related \"\". The player controls Ethan Cole, a HAZMAT operative sent to the Area 51 base to assist in the cleanup of a mutagenic virus.\n\nNotable among the voice actors are David Duchovny as Ethan Cole, Marilyn Manson as Edgar the ancient and powerful Grey, Powers Boothe as Major Bridges, Nolan North as McCan, and Ian Abercrombie as Dr. Cray.\n\n\"Area 51\" is a first-person shooter, played from the perspective of the protagonist, Ethan Cole. The game features operable machinery, including artillery turrets, besides the player's inventory of weapons.\n\nThroughout the game, the player uses a variety of weapons, both human and alien in origin, to defeat their adversaries. Most weapons can only be wielded one handed, however the player can dual wield some weapons, such as the Shotgun and the Sub-Machine Gun. Each weapon can also be used as a melee weapon for close quarter combat. Each weapon has two modes of firing, the first being the primary method, while the second is of a much higher power level, at the cost of ammunition and accuracy to the player. The player can also use explosive grenades.\n\nMidway through the game, Ethan Cole becomes infected with the mutagen, and the option to turn into a mutant temporarily is obtained. Mutating offers a variety of benefits, such as increased strength, stamina, as well as the initial ability to fire health-replenishing parasites as well as the later ability to contaminate enemies, both at the cost of mutation time reduction. While in a mutant form, players can easily spot enemies, which would otherwise be cloaked to the regular human eye, albeit with a slight ocular defect.\n\nPlayers can replenish health and mutagen either through the use of medical syringes found throughout the game or by using parasites, and mutagen by melee combat or \"using\" infected corpses, or by finding mutagen syringes.\n\nA notable aspect of gameplay is the ability to scan and analyze various objects in the game environment. This is possible by using the scanner present on the player's suit, worn throughout the game. While using a scanner, the player has no access to weapons, and must switch to an available weapon in order to fight (though they could still melee). Scanning provides detailed information on a player's surroundings, as well as combated enemies.\n\nThe scanner, when equipped, adds a translucent bar to the player's HUD, which changes in color and height from light blue, to deep red. This bar indicates how near or far a player is, to one of many scannable clues, such as file folders or personal digital assistants. The scanner can collect information from the items without it being touched. The HUD shows red when the player is very close, and blue when very far. Items which are scanned are viewable in-game, providing insight into the workings of Area 51, as well as proving necessary to unlocking secret videos made by Dr. Cray or Mr. White.\n\nIn July 1947, an alien spacecraft crashed near Roswell, New Mexico in the United States. The craft was recovered by the U.S. Air Force and taken to Area 51 in Nevada, where the lone survivor of the crash, a powerful Grey named Edgar (Marilyn Manson), was held captive by the U.S. military. Eventually, the Greys opened a dialogue with the Illuminati led by the ominous Mr. White (Phil Proctor), and struck a deal with them. The Illuminati would give the Greys a research base 3 miles below the surface of Area 51, the use of the base as a landing site, and give them human test subjects where they, along with human scientists, would research a mutagenic virus to use in a war on their homeworld. In return the Greys would give the Illuminati exclusive access to Grey technology. The Illuminati used some of this technology to spy on the population.\n\nThe Greys and the human scientists eventually developed a powerful alien being - known as the \"Theta\", which spread the virus. Unbeknownst to many of the scientists working on the project, the Greys and the Illuminati were also planning to use the virus against the Earth population and dominate the planet. When Dr. Winston Cray (Ian Abercrombie) found out about the plan, he let loose the \"Theta\" and the mutagenic virus throughout Area 51, in an effort to slow them down. This prompted the military to send in a Quick Reaction Force led by Major Bridges (Powers Boothe) to quarantine and contain the virus. HAZMAT Team Delta, the first team initially sent into Area 51 are ambushed by the \"Theta\" creature, sustaining casualties, before withdrawing deeper into the base. HAZMAT Team Bravo, composed of team leader Ramirez, McCan, Crispy, and mission specialist Ethan Cole (David Duchovny) is sent to find Delta.\n\nAfter initially encountering the mutants, McCan is killed when a mutant decapitates him. Deeper into the base, Crispy and Ramirez are both ambushed by the Theta and killed, leaving Cole on his own. Cole manages to locate the rest of Delta, however they are attacked again by the Theta, and all but Cole and Lieutenant Chew are killed. Making their way topside, the Illuminati disables the cargo elevator, killing Chew and leaving Cole bitten by one mutant, partially mutating him. Able to switch between human and mutant form, Cole is guided deeper into the base by Edgar reanimating corpses to deliver information telepathically. Cole is guided to Dr. Cray's bio labs, where Cray claims there is time to decontaminate Cole, and rid him of the virus. Before he can be cured, the Illuminati attack, killing Cray and stopping the process.\n\nCole proceeds deeper underground into a cave system, where he eventually gets reacquainted with the Theta. He manages to kill the creature, avenging both his team and HazTeam Delta. He meets Edgar miles beneath the surface who reveals the scientists used his DNA to create the virus, and the nature of the experiments at the base, which killed dozens of his species to harvest it. He then tells Cole the history of the Greys and Area 51. Edgar gives Cole the cure to the mutagenic virus, and instructs him to destroy the Grey's ship, that is leaving with dozens of Theta duplicates. Cole locates the vessel and destroys it by overloading its reactor, and uses a teleporter to escape into the Nevada desert. He lands by the \"White Mailbox\" area and watches Area 51 being destroyed by the exploding ship in a tornado like explosion. Cole watches as a truck drives past, with a green, alien-like container on board with unknown contents inside and walks away from the site. He reflects upon his original purpose at Area 51 and recognizes that while he and Hazmat Team Bravo had failed, their sacrifices may have saved mankind.\n\nThe PlayStation 2 version received \"generally favorable reviews\", while the PC and Xbox versions received \"average reviews\", according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.\n\nIn 2004, ahead of the game's release, Paramount Pictures announced that they had reached an agreement concerning the film rights for the game. In March 2007, comic book author Grant Morrison was hired to adapt the game as a screenplay. This project is unrelated to the movie \"Area 51\" by Oren Peli.\n"}

According to the 2001 UK Census, the parish had a population of 499, increasing to 533 at the 2011 Census.\n\nThe village has many historic buildings, some of which are timber-framed. The Church of St. Swithin is a Church of England church which dates from 1721, and is built on the site of an earlier church. The village also possesses two pubs, The Bulls Head and The Malt Shovel, and about 50 residential properties. The Barston Memorial Institute, opposite the Bulls Head, hosts many village activities with a Friday night youth club and regular Art Classes as well as the Barston WI and U3A meetings. There is no bus service or any other form of public transport in the village, although an abandoned bus stop still exists at the end of the central road of Barston, Oak Lane, which is left over from an old-school service from the 1970s and 1980s. Next to the bus stop is an old-fashioned red phone box.\n\nThe footballer Robbie Keane owned a house in Barston from 1999 to 2000, whilst playing for Coventry City F.C..\n\n"}

It is the most direct southerly route from the island of Montreal toward the US border. It carries Route 138, originally Route 4. It is in length and contains four steel trusses on its first section. The height of the bridge varies from to with the highest sections located over the St. Lawrence Seaway. The bridge is named after former premier of Quebec Honoré Mercier.\n\nUnique in Quebec, the bridge is managed by both the federal and provincial governments. The southwest portion of the bridge, over 1,031 metres (1128 yards) from the beginning of the arch bridge (at pile14), is the responsibility of a Crown corporation: the Jacques Cartier and Champlain Bridges Incorporated (JCCBI). The rest of the bridge (902 meters, 986 yards) is owned by the Quebec Ministry of Transport, which is also responsible for the day-to-day operations of the complex, including the federal part.\n\nThe bridge has two lanes of traffic in each direction and a total span of nearly two kilometres (1¼ miles). At its highest point, the bridge rises 36 metres (120') above the river. There is a narrow sidewalk on the side headed to Châteauguay that was for use by foot or bicycle, however it hasn't been open since major repairs began in 2009.\nThe roadway has been characterized by numerous repairs.\n\nIt is estimated that an average of 75,000 vehicles use the bridge each day. An estimated 30 million vehicles use the bridge every year.\n\nBefore the bridge was built there was a ferry service.\n\nThe bridge, known in the developmental stage as the \"Saint-Louis Bridge\" (for the nearby located Lake Saint-Louis and the parish of Saint-Louis-de-Caughnawaga, today part of the Kahnawake reserve), was designed by eleven French-Canadian engineers, all graduates of the École Polytechnique de Montréal, and was built by the Dominion Bridge Company Ltd under a government-funded work program. Construction of the bridge began in November 1932 and was completed in the early summer of 1934. It was opened to traffic on June 22, 1934 (named \"Honoré-Mercier\" during its inauguration by mayor Taschereau, 10 months ahead of schedule with a toll of 50 cents for an automobile and driver—later reduced to 25 cents. Today there is no toll charged for crossing the bridge.\n\nThe original east approach was on Lafleur Avenue, which ran straight into the Gauron Bridge over the Lachine Canal.\n\nThe higher section over the Saint Lawrence Seaway was added in the late 1950s. In August 1963, the Quebec Department of Public Works approved the construction of a \"second\" bridge downstream from the first. This increased the number of lanes from two to four.\n\nDuring the Oka Crisis in July and August 1990, the bridge was closed to all traffic for over a month by Mohawks who supported their brothers from Kanesatake. This closure period led to violent tempers and clashes between Mohawks and people from Châteauguay, and the extension of Autoroute 30 bypassing the Kahnawake reserve. As a compensatory measure, the Champlain Bridge Boom was opened to motorists and a temporary rail shuttle was introduced.\n\nDuring the Caledonia land dispute, certain individuals from Kahnawake erected Warrior and Confederacy flags on the steel trusses of the bridge to show their support.\n\nThe bridge was closed for a short period, in order to allow several men from the community to climb the structure and secure the flags. To ensure their safety, the Kahnawake Peacekeepers stopped traffic from the Kahnawake side of the bridge, while the Quebec Provincial Police blocked access on the Lasalle side. Several weeks later one of the Warrior flags was removed from the bridge and replaced with a Quebec flag (the red Warrior flag is barely visible in the above picture between the first 'V' section of the truss).\n\nOn June 29, 2007, community members of Kahnawake staged a peaceful protest on the bridge, in support of the AFN's National Day of Action. Once again men from the community placed Warrior and Confederacy flags on the structure that spans the St. Lawrence Seaway.\n\nThe Jacques Cartier and Champlain Bridges Incorporated (JCCBI) (in French: Ponts Jacques Cartier et Champlain Incorporée, PJCCI), a federal Crown corporation, is responsible for managing, operating and maintaining the Mercier Bridge where it crosses the Mohawk Reserve of Kahnawake. This comprises the ramps leading to the bridge on the south shore (\"Ramps\" Sector), the span over the St. Lawrence Seaway (\"Seaway\" Sector), and the stretch above \"Ile Maline\" (\"B1 Island\" Sector). The Ministry of Transport of Quebec (MTQ) is responsible for the bridge where it crosses the St. Lawrence River (\"B2\" Sector).\n\n2009 saw the start of a complete rehabilitation of the bridge, the largest ever undertaken in Canada. For the first time since 1934, the deck of the Mercier Bridge will be partially replaced. The work is expected to prolong the bridge's life for another 75 years. The bridge deck will be replaced using prefabricated concrete deck panels. The new deck will consist of more than 1,300 prefabricated concrete panels assembled with steel tension cables. In total, the new deck is an area of 40,684 m2 (10 acres). Numerous lane closures and redirection of traffic is expected to continue until work is completed. The project has been carried out in two parts: Phase A, replacement of the deck in the Ramps Section and Phase B, replacement of the deck in the B1, Seaway, and Mixed Sections. \nPhase A was handled by Kahnawake's Mohawk Bridge Consortium.\nPhase B was originally to be done by Pomerleau-de Mathieu Bard, but problems led to the removal of the contractor. The works were then completed by the Mohawk Bridge Consortium. The eight-year work on the federal part, led by contractor, Mohawk Bridge Consortium, was completed by the end of August 2016. A total of 982 new concrete panels were installed at a cost of $200 million.\n\nThe Quebec Ministry of Transport (MTQ) initially planned to renovate the section of the bridge under its jurisdiction at the same time and in the same manner as the federal section. On June 14, 2011, due to the extreme deterioration of 10 gusset plates, the 1930s section of the Mercier bridge was closed until September 6 (in time for school restart).\nEngineers examined each gusset and designed an individual solution of either replacement or reinforcement aimed as a permanent solution, not a patch.\nRegular inspections found the gussets to be corroded beyond what was expected. Using all known weaknesses of the bridge structure, the engineers undertook a complete recalculation of the load bearing ability of the structure. Once they calculated that and factored in a margin for safety, they decided to close the bridge at 8:04 PM on June 14, 2011. The reinforcement of existing structures was staggered until 2013. In 2014, an in-depth study was commissioned to a consortium of BPR, Genivar and SNC-Lavalin firms to determine the optimal solution for the future of the section. Provincial Bridge: Major Rehabilitation or Reconstruction.\n\nIn April 2017, the Quebec government announced the construction of a new section towards the South Shore of Montreal. The date of the beginning of the work is not determined, but it will begin sometime in 2019, once the construction of the new Champlain Bridge is completed.\n\n\n"}

The group toured the United States in June and July 1954. Following this tour, the Dance-Percussion Trio disbanded and the musicians added a second percussionist, Arnold Goldberg, thus forming a trio of two percussionists and a pianist. Shapiro was later replaced by Rolf Barnes, though he later rejoined the group.\n\nThe trio commissioned a number of new works from contemporary composers, including Harold Farberman (\"Variations for Percussion With Piano\", 1954), Halim El-Dabh (\"Hindi-Yaat no. 1\" and \"Tabla-Tahmeel no. 1\", both 1959, and \"Tabla-Dance\", 1961), and Gitta Steiner (\"Trio\", 1969). They were one of the first American percussion ensembles to utilize traditional percussion instruments from India (including tabla and mridangam), which Gould brought back following a 1959 tour of that nation with The Little Orchestra Society of New York.\n\nThe group's primary focus was presenting percussion music to young people (ranging in age from kindergarten to the college level), with most of their performances arranged by the Young Audiences, Inc. organization of New York. Through their performances across the United States (3,000 in all), the group did much to promote percussion music to the general public. They released an LP recording, entitled \"Holidays for Percussion\" (Vox, 1958), and a film, \"Percussion, the Pulse of Music\" (produced by Arts and Audiences, Inc., for the Educational Television and Radio Center, 1957), and appeared on the \"I've Got a Secret\" television program, hosted by Steve Allen, on January 24, 1966, as well as several other television programs, particularly those for children.\n\nIn addition to their work with the trio, Goldberg and Gould served for many years as members of the New York City Ballet Orchestra and the orchestras of the Martha Graham Dance Company and Joffrey Ballet; Gould retired from his post with the New York City Ballet Orchestra in 2005 and Goldberg remains with the orchestra as timpanist and orchestra manager. Shapiro was also active as a pianist, orchestra conductor, and opera producer in South Korea, Hong Kong, and the United States.\n\nIn the 1960s, a Boston, Massachusetts-based group called the New Boston Percussion Ensemble, also comprising two percussionists (James Latimer and Everett Beale) and a pianist (Allen Barker), was formed. This group also performed programs for the Young Audiences organization and performed some of the same repertoire as the New York Percussion Trio.\n\n\n"}

It is the first installment in the \"Sengoku Basara\" franchise. The original game's theme song is \"Crosswise\" by T.M.Revolution. The game was followed by several sequels and , all of them using the original title and setting of \"Sengoku Basara\" only.\n\n\"Sengoku Basara\" takes place during the Sengoku period, or Warring States period, of feudal Japan during which Japan was split into many minor states battling over power and land. The game features two historical warlords as the main protagonists: Date Masamune and Sanada Yukimura.\n\n\"Devil Kings\"' main character is Devil King (Oda Nobunaga in \"Sengoku Basara\").\n\nIt is a hack and slash, action game similar in concept to \"Devil May Cry\" and \"Samurai Warriors\".\n\nSome significant gameplay changes were made to the Western versions of the game. Four of the characters were made non-playable and various weapons were removed or added. The difficulty levels were shifted to make the game more difficult (with Easy becoming the Japanese Normal and Normal becoming the Japanese Hard). The fighting system was also modified, adding an element called \"Priming\" (one of the characters special attack was made the priming attack, and used that attack to \"Prime\" enemies making them more susceptible to damage and allowing for higher combo chains).\n\n\nWhile releasing \"Sengoku Basara\", Capcom attempted to appeal to the western audience, by removing all Sengoku and Japanese references in favor of a generic fantasy story vaguely connected with Capcom's hit franchise \"Devil May Cry\" (a \"DMC\"-type font was even used for the cover title of \"Devil Kings\").\n\nAn extract from IGN interview with the game's producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi:\n\nThese alterations were regarded as unpopular, as the \"Devil Kings\" version was a critical and commercial failure, and no more \"Sengoku Basara\" games were brought to North America and Europe until the release of \"\" in the fall of 2010.\n\nThe westernized version (\"Devil Kings\") received \"mixed or average\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.\n\nThe Japanese version was met with \"generally favorable\" reviews from fans, critics, and consumers. Fans of the franchise seem to have given the Japanese version positive reviews and the westernized version negative reviews with one stating, \"While \"Sengoku Basara\" was considered a cult classic among fans and gamers, \"Devil Kings\" was considered a terrible localization of a good game that should've been left unchanged for its western releases.\" The game received an 8/8/7/8 for a total of 31/40 from weekly Japanese video game magazine, \"Famitsu\". The game was later re-released under the PlayStation 2 \"the Best\" label (which means it is a best-seller in Japan). The game sold a total of 88,711 units during its first week on sale in Japan and was the top-selling game of the week. The game has sold a total of 232,589 units in Japan.\n\nThe first two sequels, \"Sengoku Basara 2\" and \"Sengoku Basara 2 Heroes\", were released in Japan for the PS2 in 2006–2007, followed by two spin-off games.

Reynolds Memorial Auditorium, located in Winston-Salem, NC, was built 1919–1924 under the direction of architect Charles Barton Keen (designer of the R. J. Reynolds estate, Reynolda House). Keen also designed the adjacent Richard J. Reynolds High School. Both buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe Auditorium and adjacent school sit on a tract of land formerly known as \"Silver Hill.\" The tract of land now encompasses the Auditorium, the school, Hanes Park (named after the founder of Hanes Clothing Company and then-mayor James G. Hanes), the Calvin H. Wiley Middle School and the Winston-Salem Central YMCA.\n\nThe Auditorium is now operated jointly by the Administration of the Richard J. Reynolds High School and the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools. An auditorium manager is hired to take care of the day-to-day operations of the building and scheduling of performances and events.\n\nThe Auditorium is one of the oldest and largest performing arts centers in the City of Winston-Salem. The building can comfortably seat 1898 people, with 857 seats on the main Orchestra level and 1,041 seats located on the Mezzanine/Balcony area.\n\nIn 1919, after the death of her husband R. J. Reynolds in 1918, Mrs. Katharine Smith Reynolds donated a large tract of land then known as \"Silver Hill\" to the City of Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Her plan was to have a grand school and auditorium built in memory of her late husband.\n\nWhile the Richard J. Reynolds High School would serve the youth of the city, the Auditorium would serve the entire community and act as a gathering place in order for all citizens to participate in the arts. The building of the Auditorium only added to the City of Winston-Salem's reputation as the \"City of the Arts.\"\n\nThe building was completed in 1924. By the time it was dedicated in a glorious ceremony on May 8, 1924, Katharine Reynolds, who had married J. Edward Johnston in 1921, was hospitalized with a difficult pregnancy. She died on May 23, never having attended a production in the auditorium she had built in her first husband's memory.\n\nA few weeks later, the first commencement exercises for the Richard J. Reynolds High School would be held in the Auditorium. On November 24, 1924, the Auditorium would play host to the first of its many famous guests, Harry Houdini. Other guests have included Jim Croce before his untimely death and pianist Peter Nero, both in the early 1970s.\n\nThe Grand Lobby of the Auditorium contains many pieces of art unique to the building itself. In the Lobby, one can find two large portraits, one of R. J. Reynolds and the other of Katharine Smith Reynolds. The portraits were made by Richard J. Reynolds High School graduate Joe King who also had the honor of creating a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nThe Grand Lobby also contains three marble statues. The statues are duplicates of famous Italian works and were sculpted in Italy and transported to the United States, specifically for the construction of the Auditorium.\n\nWithin the main Orchestra level of the Auditorium, one can see a portrait of R. J. Reynolds III, whose family gave large amounts of money towards the renovation and restoration of the building (2000–2002).\n\nBefore the 2000-2002 renovation and restoration of the building, a large piece of custom made carpet sat just inside the Main Orchestra level at the middle doors leading from the Grand Lobby. The carpet piece featured a large tobacco leaf, in honor of R. J. Reynolds and his R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. The carpet piece was removed during the renovation and restoration and never replaced, with it being decided that the money could be better used toward upgrading the state of the art Auditorium sound system rather than buying a new custom made carpet piece.\n\nBefore every performance at the Auditorium, members of the student-run Auditorium Technical Staff and Crew place roses under the portrait of Katherine Smith Reynolds-Johnston, in honor of her gift of the Auditorium and school. It is rumored the roses also help to ward off the \"ghost\" of Katharine Reynolds who haunts the building.\n\nThe title of the school hymn, originally written as the school song in 1933, \"Her Portals Tall and Wide,\" refers to the large columns of the Auditorium. The Auditorium's portico and columns stand at three stories tall and face downtown Winston-Salem.\n\nThe current school song, with its official title of \"Alma Mater,\" is also known as \"Amid the Pines.\" Part of the first verse reads, \"Amid the pines, she proudly stands; to her our voices rise.\" The Auditorium and School are situated on a large hill populated with grandiose pine trees which cover the entire campus. The pine trees are also mentioned in the school hymn: \"Her pleasant paths, her trees, whisper courage through the breeze.\" Following every assembly, PTSA meeting or school performance inside the Auditorium, at one time including commencement, \"The Alma Mater\" is sung. During these assemblies, semi-formal or business casual dress, usually including blazers, shirts and ties for men, is customary attire for any person gracing the Auditorium's large stage. Tradition dictates that as the Alma Mater is sung, upon the line ending with \"... dear Old Reynolds High\", in three short beats, in a 3/4 time, the assembly should not stomp their feet because it is considered disrespectful.\n\nThrough the years, the hill upon which the school and Auditorium stand has become known as \"Society Hill.\" The name commemorates the donation of the land and money to build the Auditorium and school from Mrs. Reynolds. a prominent member of the community. Generations of children, including some of the Reynolds' own children and Senator Richard Burr (R-NC) (class of 1974), have attended the school.\n\nThe auditorium is currently managed by Elizabeth May and serves as a venue for the Winston-Salem Forsyth County School System and private renters. It has received many off-Broadway productions and local dance companies. The drama department at Reynolds is currently taught by Teri Beadle who teaches out of the Black Box Theater. The orchestra director is currently Margaret Rehder, and the band director is Johnathan Hamiel with assistant Adrian Thompson. Caitie Reece and Amelia Hailey are the current dance teachers. All teach in the Arts building adjacent to the main Auditorium. The chorus director is Michael Martinez, who teaches in the chorus room, also adjacent to the main part of the Auditorium. The Choral, Orchestra, Band and Dance Departments all use the Auditorium regularly for performances.\n\n\n"}

During the Middle Ages, this, the Great St. Bernard, and the Brenner Passes were the preferred routes over the Alps for traveling emperors.\n\nAlready in use by the Romans, who maintained a legion camp in the pass around AD 15–16, this pass was an important trade route from Milan through Bivio to Augsburg It was easier to use than the Splügen Pass, due to the latter having the difficult gorges of the Hinterrhein River. One of the earliest mentions of a Christian hospice was the one placed at the pass itself, mentioned in 831. It was mentioned in documents for the following millennium, even though it was abandoned in the tenth century and rebuilt at the beginning of the eleventh. (The hospice was later abandoned for good in 1778.) During the Middle Ages the Septimer Pass was crucial to the temporal power of the Bishopric of Chur, whose extensive territories until the fourteenth century included Chiavenna. In 1236 the St. Gotthard Pass opened, allowing traffic from Lucerne to Milan, which diverted merchants from going through Chur. The pass further lost importance after the construction of roads over the Julier and Maloja passes.\n\n\n"}

They open it and discover bundles of cash. With Jane at the wheel, they are chased by another car driven, Alan deduces, by the person who was supposed to receive the money. Jane drives recklessly, making a high speed turn and zig-zagging on the difficult road. They manage to lose their pursuer and Alan takes over. As they drive back into town, they discuss what to do about the money. Jane wants to keep it but Alan feels it is probably a blackmail payoff and the police should have it. He has a chance to hand it over, but does not, when an officer stops him for failing to use his turn signal. Back at their Hollywood apartment, they examine what Alan estimates to be $100,000 in cash. Jane eventually convinces her husband that they should hide the cash for a week; she claims to be fine with whatever he decides to do. They stash the satchel at the baggage claim at Union Station, the claim ticket seemingly ends up in the lining of Alan's coat.\n\nThe next day, while Alan is at work and as Jane is hiding packages containing things she has purchased with the money in mind, Danny shows up. He claims to be a detective and says he needs to look around the place. He does not say why and he has no warrant, but says he can get one if that is what she prefers. She allows him to go ahead. He discovers the packages, one containing a fur coat, and says, \"So you've already started spending it, huh?\". Clearly not a detective but actually the man for whom the money was intended, Danny slaps Jane around a bit and demands to know where the money is. She lies, telling him that she and Alan have surrendered it to the police. He promises to return if there is no news in the evening paper about money being handed over to the cops. Alan returns home and tells her their banker phoned to let him know that their account is several hundred dollars down. She responds that she has only been buying things she needed. Alan threatens to send the claim ticket to the District Attorney's office right away; Jane threatens to take the money and run off. During their argument, he brings up her previous marriage to a man named Blanchard, who apparently died by suicide, and immediately is sorry. Jane feels she was always meant to have money, that she married Blanchard because she thought he had a lot of it; Alan believes peace of mind is more important, that they will not have that with the money in their possession. Nevertheless, he agrees to hang on to it for the rest of the agreed-to week. He suggests that the next evening they go out together and enjoy themselves the way they used to.\n\nDanny returns the next day, letting himself into the apartment using a skeleton key. Jane tells him that Alan has the money and is planning to give it to the authorities. She explains how she does not intend to allow him to do that, that she is determined to keep it. She and Danny make a deal to split the money; he gives her a number where he can be reached. Later, when she has made up her mind about what to do, Jane phones Danny and tells him to wait that night at the palm tree at the west end of Westlake Park, near downtown Los Angeles.\n\nAs part of their romantic evening, Alan and Jane rent a boat. Inside her purse, Jane has packed her husband's gun. While out on the water, she appears to feel a pang of guilt; she blurts out that she wants to give the money up, that she wants to send the claim ticket in right away. Alan tries to take his wife's mind off the topic. He wants a cigarette and picks up her purse to look for some; his gun falls out. A struggle ensues and Alan is shot dead. Jane takes control of the boat and, as per their arrangement, meets Danny. He sees the body and resists being involved in a murder, but Jane has the gun on him and promises to tell the police he killed her husband unless he helps her.\n\nAfter dumping the body in the lake, weighted by the boat's anchor, Jane and Danny leave the boat launch together - he has on Alan's coat and hat - so as to mislead witnesses into assuming she left with her husband. She extends the ruse by having Danny drive back to her apartment; she makes sure the parking garage attendant believes Alan is in the car. Having arranged to meet Danny later that night, to supposedly retrieve the money from its burial site, Jane first invites Alan's sister, Kathy - who lives across the hall - over for a nightcap. She tells Kathy that Alan has just gone out to pick up a bottle of liquor. As time goes on and Alan does not return, Jane begins to feign worry and fear. She phones the police to report him as a missing person. Kathy realizes that the couple has plenty of liquor in the apartment and questions why Alan would have gone to purchase more. Jane tries to tell her sister-in-law that their marriage is on the rocks. Kathy does not buy this and says she believes Alan will be home soon.\n\nWhen Kathy goes home, Jane picks up Danny and they drive up into the hills. Once up there, he figures that she plans to kill him. After a near-accident and she stops the car, Danny flees, after saying, \"You didn't bury that dough, and I know it\". He is still wearing the coat that has in its lining the claim ticket. Jane abandons the car. Later, she locates Danny's residence and goes there, asking for Alan's coat. Danny discovers a blank piece of paper in the lining and Jane realizes the ticket must be at home.\n\nMeanwhile, having used her personal key to the Palmer's apartment, Kathy is searching the place; she has her suspicions about Jane. She finds the claim ticket in a dresser drawer. As she opens the door to leave, she comes face-to-face with a man who introduces himself as Don Blake, an old Army Air Corps buddy of Alan's on vacation in Los Angeles. Kathy tells him that Alan is missing.\n\nLater, while Jane is looking around her apartment for the claim ticket, a police lieutenant comes to report that the Palmer vehicle was in a near-accident the previous night and that a man got out of the car and left the scene. The implication is that it was Alan and another woman. The vehicle has been located and the matter appears to be closed, but not for Kathy, who all but says that she has doubts about her sister-in-law. Don arrives and, in the course of their conversation, Jane quizzes him on his experience in England with Alan during the war; his answers are not convincing. After he leaves, Jane phones a man she knows for certain served with Alan and asks him to drop by. Danny makes another appearance; Jane tells him about Kathy and begs him to procure poison to kill her.\n\nDon and Kathy are drawn to each other. She wonders why he is so anxious to help find Alan and yet does not talk about him as if they really were friends in England. A drunken Danny returns with the poison and, after rambling for a few minutes, leaves. Don stops by Kathy's to ask her out for dinner. She shows him the claim ticket, asking him to take her to Union Station afterwards. Don is intrigued and suggests they go right away. Jane interrupts the couple as they are leaving and tells them a lie about a note from Alan she has found in the returned car. Alan, she says, is in Mexico and she is going there to find him. She asks them to come to her apartment, where the man who actually was an air corps comrade of Alan's is waiting. It is evident that Don has been lying. Jane holds a gun on him and retrieves the ticket; her sister-in-law runs back to her own apartment to call police, then subsequently finds Don unconscious in Jane's apartment. She notifies police to stake out Union Station. When Don wakes up, he confesses to Kathy that he does not know her brother, but he will explain further later.\n\nJane manipulates a stranger into claiming the bag of cash, then goes to Danny's. He is hungover and leery of her. She asks him to help her run away but she needs to know where the money came from and if it is safe to spend. Danny says it was a \"once in a lifetime\" blackmail payoff from an insurance scam. She understands this means the money is unmarked and its disappearance won't be reported to the police. She kills Danny with a drink laced with the poison he had provided her.\n\nAfter finding Danny's body, the Los Angeles police tell Don that if he wants the small lake at Westlake Park dragged in search of Jane's missing husband, it'll cost thousands of dollars; besides, they don't believe his theories. Jane flees with the money to Mexico City, where she has a penthouse at the posh Reforma Hotel. Don turns up at her door. Concluding he is either after the money or with the police, Jane pleads with him to take half. Don tells her he is the brother of Jane's first husband, Bob Blanchard, that \"this is a vendetta, but it's over now\", that now that he knows her, he understands how she could have driven his brother to kill himself. As Mexican police detectives rush into the room, Jane holds them at bay with her gun; in tears, she backs away onto a balcony, where she trips. She falls over the railing, screaming, to her death. Don meets Kathy in the lobby and apologizes, saying, \"Well, it was a short honeymoon, Kathy. We're going home now\".\n\n\nWhen the film was released \"The New York Times\" wrote:\nMore recently, film critic Dennis Schwartz also wrote a favorable review:\n\n"}
{"id": "2295107", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2295107", "title": "Missing dollar riddle", "text": "Missing dollar riddle\n\nThe missing dollar riddle is a famous riddle that involves an informal fallacy. It dates back to at least the 1930s, although similar puzzles are much older.\n\nAlthough the wording and specifics can alter, the puzzle runs along these lines:\nThree guests check into a hotel room. The manager says the bill is $30, so each guest pays $10. Later the manager realizes the bill should only have been $25. To rectify this, he gives the bellhop $5 as five one-dollar bills to return to the guests.\n\nOn the way to the guests' room to refund the money, the bellhop realizes that he cannot equally divide the five one-dollar bills among the three guests. As the guests aren't aware of the total of the revised bill, the bellhop decides to just give each guest $1 back and keep $2 as a tip for himself, and proceeds to do so.\n\nAs each guest got $1 back, each guest only paid $9, bringing the total paid to $27. The bellhop kept $2, which when added to the $27, comes to $29. So if the guests originally handed over $30, what happened to the remaining $1?\n\nThere seems to be a discrepancy, as there cannot be two answers ($29 and $30) to the math problem. On the one hand it is true that the $25 in the register, the $3 returned to the guests, and the $2 kept by the bellhop add up to $30, but on the other hand, the $27 paid by the guests and the $2 kept by the bellhop add up to only $29.\n\nThe misdirection in this riddle is in the second half of the description, where \"unrelated amounts\" are added together and the listener assumes those amounts should add up to 30, and is then surprised when they do not ⁠— ⁠there is, in fact, no reason why the (10 ⁠− ⁠1) ⁠× ⁠3 ⁠ + ⁠2 ⁠ = ⁠29 sum should add up to 30.\n\nThe exact sum mentioned in the riddle is computed as:\n<poem>\nSUM = $9 (payment by Guest 1) + \n</poem>\n\nThe trick here is to realize that this is not a sum of the money that the three people paid originally, as that would need to include the money the clerk has ($25). This is instead a sum of a smaller amount the people could have paid ($9 × 3 people = $27), added with the additional money that the clerk would not have needed had they paid that smaller amount ($27 paid - $25 actual cost = $2). Another way to say this is, the $27 already includes the bellhop's tip. To add the $2 to the $27 would be to double-count it. So, the three guests' cost of the room, including the bellhop's tip, is $27. Each of the 3 guests has $1 in his pocket, totalling $3. When added to the $27 revised cost of the room (including tip to the bellhop), the total is $30.\n\nTo obtain a sum that totals to the original $30, every dollar must be accounted for, regardless of its location.\n\nThus, the sensible sum that we really desire is this one: \n<poem>\n$30 = $1 (inside Guest pocket) + \n</poem>\n\nThis sum does indeed come out to $30.\n\nTo further illustrate why the riddle's sum does not relate to the actual sum, we can alter the riddle so that the discount on the room is extremely large. Consider the riddle in this form:\n\nNow it is more obvious that the question is quite unreasonable. One cannot simply add a couple of payments together and expect them to total an original amount of circulated cash.\n\nMore economically, money is accounted by summing together all paid amounts (liabilities) with all money in one's possession (assets). That abstract formula holds regardless of the relative perspectives of the actors in this exchange.\n\n\nTo illustrate the issue through equations: \n\n1) 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \n\n2) 10 + 10 + 10 = 25 + 2 + 3\n\n3) 10 + 10 + 10 - 3 = 25 + 2 + 3 - 3 (adding -3 to both sides of the equation to cancel out the +3 on the right side)\n\n4) 10 - 1 + 10 - 1 + 10 - 1 = 25 + 2 \n\n5) 9 + 9 + 9 = 25 + 2 (obs: tip to waiter has already been paid)\n\n6) 27 = 27\n\nHow the riddle is deceptive comes in line 7:\n\n5) 9 + 9 + 9 = 25 + 2\n\n7) 9 + 9 + 9 + 2 = 25 (pushing +2 to the other side without inverting the sign)\n\n8) 27 + 2 = 25\n\n9) 29 != 25\n\nHow it should be:\n\n5) 9 + 9 + 9 = 25 + 2\n\n10) 9 + 9 + 9 -2 = 25 + 2 -2 (adding -2 to both sides of the equation to cancel the +2 on the right side, which means the waiter returned the tip or gave a discount of $2)\n\n11) 9 + 9 + 9 - 2 = 25\n\n12) 27 - 2 = 25\n\n13) 25 = 25\n\nThe puzzle should subtract the waiter's tip from the $27 rather than add it.\n\nThere are many variants of the puzzle. Professor David Singmaster's \"Chronology of Recreational Mathematics\" suggests these type of mathematical misdirection puzzles descended from a problem in an 18th-century arithmetic, Francis Walkingame's Tutor's Assistant which was published, and republished, from 1751 to 1860 where it appeared on page 185, prob. 116 in this form, \"If 48 taken from 120 leaves 72, and 72 taken from 91 leaves 19, and 7 taken from thence leaves 12, what number is that, out of which, when you have taken 48, 72, 19, and 7, leaves 12?\" Singmaster adds, \"Though this is not the same as the withdrawal problems below, the mixing of amounts subtracted and remainders makes me think that this kind of problem may have been the basis of the later kind.\"\n\nAn 1880 misdirection is given as \"Barthel sees two boxes at a jeweller's, priced at 100 and 200. He buys the cheaper one and takes it home, where he decides he really prefers the other. He returns to the jeweller and gives him the box back and says that the jeweller already has 100 from him, which together with the returned box, makes 200, which is the cost of the other box. The jeweller accepts this and gives Barthel the other box and Barthel goes on his way. Is this correct?\"\n\nA model more similar in style to the modern version was given by Cecil B. Read in his 1933 'Mathematical Fallacies'. His puzzle produces an extra dollar: A man puts $50 in the bank. Then on subsequent days he withdraws $20 leaving $30; then $15 leaving $15; then $9 leaving $6, and finally $6 leaving $0. But $30 + $15 + $6 = $51. Where did the extra dollar come from?\n\nThe actual solution to this riddle is to add correctly (correct time, correct person and correct location) from the bank point of view which in this case seems to be the problem: \n\n\nFrom the owner point of view the correct solution is this:\n\n\nThe solution appears very obvious if the owner withdraws every day only $10 from $50. To add up 40 + 30 + 20 + 10 using the same pattern from above would be too obviously wrong (result would be $100).\n\nThe answer to the question, \"Where did the extra dollar come from?” can be found from consecutively adding the bank rest from three different days. This way is correct only if the money owner withdraws every day exact half of the money. Then it will add up. ($25 + $12.50 + $6.25) + $6.25 = $50\n\nAnother entry from 1933, R. M. Abraham's \"Diversions and Pastimes\" (still available in a Dover version) poses a slightly different approach with this problem from page 16 (problem 61). \"A traveller returning to New York found that he had only a ten-dollar postal money order, and that his train fare was seven dollars. The ticket clerk refused to accept the money order, so the traveller went across the road to a pawn shop and pawned it for seven dollars. On his way back to the station he met a friend, who, to save the traveller the trouble of returning to redeem the money order, bought the pawn ticket from him for seven dollars. The traveller then bought his ticket and still had seven dollars when he got to New York. Who made the loss?\" David Darling in his \"The Universal book of Mathematics\", credits this as an earlier version of the three men in a hotel version above.\n\nEven more similar is the English, \"The Black-Out Book\" by Evelyn August in 1939; What happened to the shilling?, pp. 82 & 213. Three girls each pay five shillings to share a room. The landlord refunds 5 shillings via the bellboy, who gives them each one and keeps two.\n\nAnd one more from the same theme appears in an Abbott and Costello routine in which Abbott asks Costello for a fifty-dollar loan. Costello holds out forty dollars and says, \"That's all I have.\" Abbott responds, \"Fine, you can owe me the other ten.\"\n\nThe riddle is used by psychotherapist (Chris Langham) with his mathematician client (Paul Whitehouse) in episode 5 of the 2005 BBC comedy series \"Help\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2295117", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2295117", "title": "Pergamino", "text": "Pergamino\n\nPergamino () is an Argentine city in the Province of Buenos Aires. It has a population of about 104,985 inhabitants as per the and is the administrative seat of its county, Pergamino Partido. Its UN/LOCODE is ARPGO.\n\nLong valued for its many springs and fertile land, the area had been home to the Charrúa and Araucanian people when it was first noticed by Spanish colonist around 1620. Becoming a posada along the trade route between colonial Buenos Aires and Córdoba, the settlement was given its name on 3 January 1626, for the parchment paper (document lost by a group of Spaniards) found there and conforming to an Araucanian term meaning \"red soil.\"\n\nThe settlement's first businesses were established in 1700 and in 1749, recurrent attacks by displaced natives led to the construction of a fort. These attacks did not cease, however, and on 8 August 1751 the settlement was destroyed. The site continued to be of interest, and Commander Juan González ordered the village rebuilt on orders from the Buenos Aires colonial government in 1769. The Curate of nearby Arrecifes ordained a Parish in Pergamino in 1779 and the new Viceroyalty of Río de la Plata assigned the area a \"partido\" (county) in 1784. The fort played a prominent role during the initial battles in the war for independence and, in 1815, was the site of a mutiny led by Col. Ignacio Álvarez Thomas against the fledgling nation's Head of State, Director Carlos María de Alvear. Col. Álvarez Thomas' coup d'état against Director de Alvear's brief though highly divisive autocracy averted the dissolution of the United Provinces of the River Plate, the confederacy that later became Argentina.\n\nFollowing the struggle for independence, the progressive new Governor of Buenos Aires, Martín Rodríguez, assigned Pergamino a Justice of the Peace in 1822 and the first school was opened in 1828. The town soon became home to a number of abattoirs and following the 1829 rise of Governor Juan Manuel de Rosas (whose family interests centered around cattle-raising) a close alliance developed between the governor and Pergamino's most prominent families, the Acevedos and the Anchorenas; Rosas' repressive regime, however, resulted in the sole school's closure in 1838. Following Governor Rosas' 1852 overthrow, the local gentry allied themselves to Bartolomé Mitre, a prominent advocate on behalf of Buenos Aires Province for greater autonomy. Mitre was elected governor in 1860 and President of Argentina in 1862. President Mitre's 1862 establishment of Argentina's first institute of Agronomy helped lead to the development of a new economic activity in the region around Pergamino: intensive agriculture. The first Argentine grain shipment to arrive intact in the United Kingdom in 1875 touched off an agricultural boom that for Pergamino, resulted in the massive cultivation of maïze. The city's growth accelerated further upon the arrival of the Central Argentine Railway in 1882, en route to Rosario. Pergamino, whose population by then exceeded 10,000 and home to over 90 registered businesses, was formally designated as a city on 23 October 1895.\n\nContinuing to rely economically on maize, local landowners funded the establishment of an agricultural laboratory in 1912. Pergamino's population, now mostly European immigrants and their children, nearly tripled to almost 30,000 between 1895 and 1914; this era saw the establishment of important Basque, Piemontese, Provençal and Lebanese communities, as well as the inauguration of the \"Hotel Roma\" in 1913, one of the best-known art nouveau structures in the area. One immigrant from the Piedmont, Enrique Venini, founded Pergamino's first newspaper, \"La Opinión\", in 1917. The city's growing immigrant communities also included a sizable contingent of British railway engineers and other technicians associated with the rapidly expanding railways. A number of these staffers and the Central Argentine Railway's director, Ronald Leslie, organized Pergamino's first football team on 18 November 1918, christening it in honor of a British Field Marshal famed for his roles in the Boer War and in World War I, Gen. Douglas Haig. Club Atlético Douglas Haig has enjoyed regional prominence in the Argentine B League.\nPergamino's main church and city hall were both completed in 1930. Following a decade of prosperity, however, the great depression led to the ruin of the majority of the area's small landholders. The city soon began to recover, and celebrated the opening of the Municipal Fine Arts Museum in 1936, for instance. A devastating flood in 1939 led to construction of levees and canals along the Pergamino River. Growing to nearly 50,000 people by 1947, the city's first large manufacturing establishments began to operate at this time. Pergamino's agricultural sector, however, was strained by the creation of a national export grain purchaser, the IAPI, by President Juan Perón in 1946; although Pergamino benefited from IAPI investment in irrigation and other infrastructure works, the low prices the agency paid local growers also led to the bankruptcy of number. The dissolution of the IAPI following Perón's overthrow in 1955 and the 1956 establishment of the National Agricultural Laboratory (INTA) in Pergamino helped revitalize the sector in the area and nationally.\n\nThe elections of 1963 carried a native of Pergamino, Dr. Arturo Illia, to the Presidency; President Illia prioritized economic growth while keeping national budgets nearly balanced, the combination of which helped lead to unprecedented growth in Pergamino. The city's first high-rises were built, as well as the industrial district; President Illia graced his birthplace with numerous visits during his tenure. Another native of Pergamino, Héctor Chavero, became nationally renowned during that era after releasing an album of folklore ballads and narration, \"El payador perseguido\" (\"The Persecuted Troubadour\"); by then, he was known by his pseudonym, Atahualpa Yupanqui and has remained, long after his death in 1992, arguably the most influential musician of his genre in Argentina.\n\nOne of Pergamino's Lebanese immigrants, Isaac Annan, established the city's first garment factory during the late 1940s, creating Far West Jeans and Manhattan Shirts, two of Argentina's best-known domestic clothing brands. By 1970, Wrangler Jeans, Fiorucci, Levi's, Lee Jeans and a number of local firms, had established large textile plants, employing about 6,000. Roberto Genoud, the son of French immigrants, established the area's largest lumber and furniture factory. Pergamino continued to grow, reaching a population of 70,000 in 1980, becoming northern Buenos Aires Province's industrial center. Economic instability nationwide began to take its toll on that sector after 1975, however, and by 1985 a number of local textile manufacturers had closed or were replaced by smaller cooperatives. The city was chosen as the site for the prestigious National Viral Research Institute (INEVH) in 1978, and was home to one of the nation's first cable television stations in 1985. The city's main daily, \"La Opinión\", closed in 1989 amid a national economic crisis. Financially distressed, the daily's founders, the Veninis, sold the company to local cable TV entrepreneur Hugo Apesteguía, the current owner.\n\nSerious floods in 1939, 1975, 1984 and 1995 underscored the need for more investments in infrastructure and by 2002, the combined effects of a wave of imports and an acute economic crisis led to the closure of most of Pergamino's industries and many of its retail establishments; the textile industry, in particular, was reduced to about 600 workers; amid rising unemployment, crime rates and general pessimism, one of the most notable achievements in that difficult era was the establishment of the Pergamino Regional University, the city's first institution of higher learning, in 1993. The school was absorbed into the National University of Northwestern Buenos Aires upon that latter entity's creation in 2002, and its Pergamino campus today enrolls about 500 students yearly.\n\nThe economic recovery Argentina began to experience in 2003 has led to a dramatic recovery in the city's industrial base, as well the area's agricultural production; in 2003 alone, the city saw 2,500 manufacturing jobs return. The county's is dedicated almost entirely to agriculture and, though local farmers have diversified into poultry and dairy production, Pergamino still plays an important role in Argentina's cereal harvest, particularly soy and maize, as well as being home to half the national sales of seed for cultivation; as such, the city was declared National Capital of the Seed in 1998. Even so, agricultural employment accounts for only 8% of the county's total and employment in manufacturing, which has growing by about 13% annually, accounted for 22% of the total in 2006, or about 10,000 jobs. Though still led by the textile and lumber industries, manufacturing in Pergamino is more diversified than in the past and these two sectors today employ less than a third of industrial labor. Pergamino's financial sector has likewise recovered: the value of locally originated loans nearly doubled between 2002 and 2006, reaching US$52 million and local deposits nearly tripled, reaching almost US$100 million.\n\nThe mayor of Pergamino, Dr. Héctor Gutiérrez, is (as most of the city's past mayors) affiliated with the centrist Radical Civic Union, Argentina's oldest continuously existing political party. Elected in 1999, he has capitalized on the city's economic recovery by emphasizing public works and in 2005, successfully lobbied the Administration of President Néstor Kirchner for a 180 km (112 mi) extension of the Route 8 expressway into Pergamino, a long-overdue improvement for one of the nation's most-transited stretches of two-lane road.\n\nPergamino has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification \"Cfa\") with hot, humid summers and mild to cool winters. The highest temperature recorded was on January 9, 2012 while the lowest temperature recorded was on Juny 14, 1967.\n\n\n"}

She is known as a co-founder of the design company Artek and as a collaborator on its most well-known designs. As Artek's first artistic director, her creative output spanned textiles, lamps, glassware, and buildings. \nAino Mandelin was born in Helsinki, and completed her school education in 1913 at the Helsingin Suomalainen Tyttökoulu (Helsinki Finnish Girls' School). She began studies in architecture that same year at the Institute of Technology, Helsinki, and qualified as an architect in 1920. That same year she went to work for architect in Helsinki. In 1923 she moved to the city of Jyväskylä to work in the office of architect Gunnar Achilles Wahlroos, but the following year switched to working in the office of architect Alvar Aalto. Mandelin married Alvar Aalto in 1925. The Aaltos spent their honeymoon in northern Italy. It was common at that time for young architects in Scandinavia to travel to Italy to study the vernacular architecture, which had a profound influence on Scandinavian architecture during the 1920s, flourishing in the so-called Nordic Classicism style.\n\nThe Aaltos moved their office to Turku in 1927, and started collaborating with architect Erik Bryggman. The office moved again in 1933 to Helsinki. The Aaltos designed and built a joint house-office (1935–36) for themselves in Munkkiniemi, a suburb of Helsinki, but later (1954–55) had a purpose-built office built in the same neighbourhood.\n\nAino Aalto's role in the design of the architecture attributed to Alvar Aalto has never been specifically verified. Their early built works were mostly small-scale buildings, especially summer villas, designed in the style of Nordic Classicism. Chief among these was the Aalto's own summer villa, Villa Flora in Alajärvi from 1926 (extended 1938). \n\nIt is known that in the design work she concentrated more on the design of interiors (such as the world-famous Villa Mairea in Noormarkku of 1937-39), but also furniture (such as the Paimio Sanatorium of 1927–29). In 1935 the Aaltos, together with Maire Gullichsen (chief client for the Villa Mairea) and Nils-Gustav Hahlin, founded Artek, a firm selling lighting fixtures and furniture designed by the Aaltos. Aino was the head designer of Artek and later became the managing director of the firm. Artek still produces Aalto furniture today, but now it is owned by a private company. In the early years of their marriage and design partnership Aino Aalto and her husband would enter architectural competitions with their own separate entries. In the mid 1920s the Aaltos became the first architects in Finland to adopt the purified Functionalist style of architecture coming from central Europe. In Aino Aalto's own individual work this comes out in her entry for the Finnish pavilion for the 1939 New York World's Fair, the first prize for which, however, was won by Alvar Aalto. \nAino Aalto also designed several glassware objects for the Finnish company Iittala, who made household objects. Her most famous glass design is still on sale, and slightly different copies made by companies such as IKEA are widespread. She also collaborated with her husband on the design of the celebrated Savoy Vase in 1936.\n\nAalto actively worked in the Artek office until 1949, when she died of cancer.\n\nIn 2004 an exhibition and book (edited by Ulla Kinnunen) was arranged at the Alvar Aalto Museum, Jyväskylä, Finland, featuring the life's work of Aino Aalto.\n\n"}

{"id": "2295173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2295173", "title": "Rana (genus)", "text": "Rana (genus)\n\nRana is a genus of frogs commonly known as the Holarctic true frogs, pond frogs or brown frogs. Members of this genus are found through much of Eurasia and western North America. Many other genera were formerly included here.\nThese true frogs are usually largish species characterized by their slim waists and wrinkled skin; many have thin ridges running along their backs, but they generally lack \"warts\" as in typical toads. They are excellent jumpers due to their long, slender legs. The typical webbing found on their hind feet allows for easy movement through water. Coloration is mostly greens and browns above, with darker and yellowish spots.\n\nMany frogs in this genus breed in early spring, although subtropical and tropical species may breed throughout the year. Males of most of the species are known to call, but a few species are thought to be voiceless. Females lay eggs in rafts or large, globular clusters, and can produce up to 20,000 at one time.\n\n\"Rana\" species feed mainly on insects and invertebrates, but swallow anything they can fit into their mouths, including small vertebrates. Among their predators are egrets, crocodiles, and snakes.\n\nSome 50 to 100 extant species are now placed in this genus by various authors; many other species formerly placed in \"Rana\" are now placed elsewhere. Frost restricted \"Rana\" to the Old World true frogs and the Eurasian brown and pond frogs of the common frog \"R. temporaria\" group, although other authors disagreed with this arrangement. In 2016, a consortium of \"Rana\" researchers from throughout Europe, Asia, and North America revised the group, and reported that the arrangement of Frost (2006) resulted in nonmonophyletic groups. Yuan et al. (2016) included all the North American ranids within \"Rana\", and used subgenera for the well-differentiated species groups within \"Rana\". Both of these classifications are presented below.\n\nGenera recently split from \"Rana\" are \"Babina\", \"Clinotarsus\" (including \"Nasirana\"), \"Glandirana\", \"Hydrophylax\", \"Hylarana\", \"Lithobates\", \"Odorrana\" (including \"Wurana\"), \"Pelophylax\", \"Pulchrana\", \"Sanguirana\", and \"Sylvirana\". Of these, \"Odorrana\" is so closely related to \"Rana\" proper, it could conceivably be included here once again. The others seem to be far more distant relatives, in particular \"Pelophylax\".\n\nNew species are still being described in some numbers. A number of extinct species are in the genus, including \"Rana basaltica\", from Miocene deposits in China.\n\nThe following species are recognised in the genus \"Rana\":\n\nAmphibiaWeb includes the following species, arranged in subgenera:\nSubgenus \"Amerana\" (Pacific brown frogs)\n\nSubgenus \"Aquarana\" (North American water frogs)\n\nSubgenus \"Lithobates\" (neotropical true frogs)\n\nSubgenus \"Liuhurana\"\n\nSubgenus \"Pantherana\" (leopard, pickerel and gopher frogs)\n\nSubgenus \"Pseudorana\" (Weining brown frog)\n\nSubgenus \"Rana\" (Eurasian brown frogs)\n\nSubgenus \"Zweifelia\" (Mexican torrent frogs)\n\n\"Incertae sedis\" (no assigned subgenus)\n\n\nNotes on other taxonomic arrangements:\n\nThe harpist brown frog, Kampira Falls frog, or Yaeyama harpist frog was formerly known as \"R. psaltes\"; it was subsequently identified as the long-known \"R. okinavana\". The latter name has been misapplied to the Ryūkyū brown frog, but the harpist brown frog is a rather distinct species that apparently belongs in \"Babina\" or \"Nidirana\" if these are considered valid.\n\n"}
{"id": "2295174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2295174", "title": "Saint Jacques Street", "text": "Saint Jacques Street\n\nSaint Jacques Street (officially in ), or St. James Street, is a major street in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.\n\nThe street is commonly known by two names, \"St. James Street\" in English (after St. James's, London) and \"rue Saint-Jacques\" in French. Both names are used in English and French, although Saint-Jacques is the most common for geographical reference. St. James Street is usually used in reference to the street's historic importance as a financial district.\n\nA main thoroughfare passing through Old Montreal, the street was first opened in 1672. The portion between McGill Street and place Saint Henri was originally called Bonaventure Street (\"rue Saint-Bonaventure\"). This name has passed down to Place Bonaventure, Bonaventure Expressway, and Bonaventure Metro station, despite the disappearance of their original referents.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, St. James Street was the centre of Montreal's financial district and where several major English insurance, banking, and trust companies built their Canadian head offices. Prior to World War I, Canadian, provincial, and major municipal governments along with important industries such as the railways, public utility and canal companies obtained most of their capital financing in the United Kingdom or the United States. At the end of the War, St. James Street grew rapidly and although by the 1920s there were stock exchanges in Toronto, Winnipeg, Calgary and Vancouver, St. James Street's stock brokerage houses and the Montreal Stock Exchange were the most important in all of Canada. At the time of its construction in 1928, the Royal Bank of Canada's new headquarters at 360 St. James Street was the tallest building in the British Empire. The St James St. area was also the head office of the Bank of Montreal, and the informal head office of the Bank of Nova Scotia. It was also home to the major brokerage houses such as Nesbitt, Thomson and Company, Pitfield, MacKay, Ross, Royal Securities Corporation and others.\n\nSome companies, past and present, located on St. James Street are:\n\n\nEast of Place d'Armes square, the street was home to two French-Canadian financial institutions, the Banque Canadienne Nationale and the Banque du Peuple, long gone now.\n\nA steady erosion of its status as Canada's financial centre began with the opening of the Saint Lawrence Seaway in 1959, followed by the political uncertainty as a result of the election of the separatist Parti Québécois provincial government in 1976, all served as a catalyst for financial institutions to locate elsewhere. A number chose to gradually move their official head offices to Toronto, Ontario, while others shifted all future expansion to Toronto or other major Canadian centres. As a result, the St. James Street financial district has all but disappeared.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the Montreal Expos baseball club unveiled plans to build a new stadium in downtown Montreal, right off St. Jacques Street, just south of the Bell Centre. When provincial funding for the new building fell through, the Expos did not continue with their plan and sold the property to developers. That stretch of Saint Jacques is now undergoing considerable gentrification.\n\nToday, the stretch of St. Jacques Street between McGill Street and Saint Laurent Boulevard is still notable mostly for its grand Neo-Classical buildings on the part of the street running through the Old Montreal district. These include Bank of Montreal's domed Montreal Main Branch, the former headquarters of Royal Bank of Canada, the Canadian Bank of Commerce, the Molson Bank and the Canada Life Insurance Company. More modern buildings include the Montreal World Trade Centre and the Stock Exchange Tower.\n\nFarther west, St. Jacques Street runs through the residential neighbourhoods of Little Burgundy, Saint-Henri, Notre-Dame-de-Grâce and Lachine. Lionel-Groulx and Place-Saint-Henri Metro stations are located on St. Jacques in the South West borough; to the west, it gives access to Autoroute 20 in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, where it passes through a largely industrial and large-surface commercial district at the top of the Falaise Saint-Jacques. The McGill University Health Centre superhospital will front Saint-Jacques in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce.\n\n"}

While a student, he was invited in 1870 by his professor Charles Frederick Hartt (1840–1878) to follow him in a study travel to Brazil (the Morgan Expedition), and returning again with him in 1871, this time going to the Tapajós River in the Amazon. Just after his graduation, Derby accepted a post of assistant professor at Cornell and briefly substituted for Hartt during another travel to Brazil in 1874. In June of the same year, Derby defended his doctoral thesis on the carboniferous brachiopoda in the Amazon.\n\nWhen Hartt organized the first Geological Commission of the Empire of Brazil, Derby was nominated its assistant and returned to Brazil in December 1875. In 1877, with the end of the Commission, Derby decided to stay in Brazil and accepted a post at the National Museum of Rio de Janeiro. He became also a member and director of the Geographic and Geological Commission of São Paulo from 1886 to 1904. This commission later originated the Astronomical and Geophysical Institute of the University of São Paulo. Derby founded also the first Botanical Gardens in São Paulo (\"Horto Botânico\").

It was released by 20th Century Fox. Marilyn Monroe appeared in one of her earliest roles.\n\nIn 1876, Johnny Jameson (Dan Dailey), a \"drummer\" (traveling salesman), is the only passenger on the inaugural run of the Tomahawk and Western Railroad's narrow gauge train through the Colorado Rockies. During the ride, the conductor tells Johnny that certain people, stagecoach operators for example, would like to see the railroad's franchise fail. Soon afterwards, Dakota (Rory Calhoun), Trancas and Gila, who work for Colonel Dawson, the area stageline operator, cause a giant boulder to fall directly in the path of the train. Engineer Terence Sweeny (Walter Brennan) manages to stop the train in time, and he and the crew then disembark to move the rock.\n\nJohnny decides to walk to the town of Epitaph and hitches a ride with Trancas and Gila. At the sheriff's office, when Johnny tries to report the train's delay to deputy Chuckity Jones (Charles Kemper), he is knocked out by Trancas. U.S. Marshal Kit Dodge, meanwhile, is in the room next door getting ready to welcome the train with help from his tomboyish, knife-wielding granddaughter Kit (Anne Baxter). As they leave for the depot they are surprised by Trancas and Gila. The marshal shoots Trancas but is wounded by Gila. Johnny comes round and Kit suspects that he may also be one of the gang. Despite Chuckity intervening on his behalf she orders him to leave town before sunset.\n\nKit is deputized as a U.S. Marshal by her grandfather, who now cannot travel because of his wound. She and an Indian companion named Pawnee (Chief Yowlachie) are assigned to escort the train to Tomahawk. Colonel Dawson orders Dakota to join the posse that is escorting the train and also an Indian scout, Black Wolf, to stir up the local Arapahos. Other gang members plot to blow up the engine during a night stop.\n\nOnly after he has bought his ticket out of town does Sweeny learn that there is no track laid for the next forty miles. He is informed by local railway entrepreneur, Bishop, that the rails were lost at sea en route from England. Bishop explains that as the train must reach Tomahawk to fulfill the requirements of the franchise contract, he has arranged for the engine car to be hauled by a team of mules. Another condition is that the train must reach Tomahawk by a rapidly approaching deadline with at least one paying passenger. Kit is not pleased to discover that the passenger assigned to her care is Sweeny. Johnny, now reluctant to travel on the train, is roped alongside the cab as the locomotive, minus its passenger car, sets off pulled by the mules and accompanied by assorted wagons. Chinese laundry man Long Time (Victor Sen Yung) joins the group with much delayed laundry for Tomahawk, together with Madame Adelaide (Connie Gilchrist) and her dancing girls, Annie, Ruby, Clara (Marilyn Monroe) and Julie. A musician with pianola accompanies them.\n\nAs planned, Dawson's men Bat, Charley and Fargo show up at a night stop claiming to be telegraph men who are there to repair lines cut by the Arapahos and Kit gives them permission to bunk in the camp. Gradually Kit softens her attitude towards Johnny. When all are asleep, Bat and Charley leave while Fargo tosses sticks of dynamite under the engine. Johnny, sleeping alongside the train, smells the lit fuse and alerts the others. Kit then cuts the fuse with a shot and disables Fargo but before he can talk Dakota kills him.\n\nSome time later, a few miles beyond where the track restarts, Bat and Charley are placing dynamite charges on a trestle bridge. Johhny, Kit and Pawnee are scouting ahead and stop at the bridge. Bat and Charley consider shooting them but are then themselves attacked and killed by Indians and the dynamite is set off prematurely. Kit, Johnny and Pawnee are chased back to the train which is then attacked by the war party. Johnny identifies the Arapaho chief, Crooked Knife, having previously worked with him in a travelling western show. After the war party is driven off, Johnny volunteers to talk peace with him. He has learned that Long Time is carrying a load of fireworks and develops a plan. He is welcomed by Crooked Knife, who agrees to allow the train safe passage. However, some of the braves distrust Johnny and ask him to produce a sign that he is \"big medicine.\" Johnny sets off a rocket, signaling Kit and Dakota to set off the rest of the fireworks on a nearby hill, and the Indians are impressed. As the railway bridge is now out, Kit intends to take the thirty-three-ton locomotive over a mountain by dismantling it and carrying it in sections. Dawson, meanwhile, thinks he has been double-crossed and shoots Black Wolf. He then rounds up his men for a final showdown.\n\nAfter Kit discovers that Dakota has sabotaged a vital water tower, Dakota jumps aboard the train, slugs Johnny and at gunpoint makes the fireman start the engine rolling and takes off at high speed down the tracks. Kit jumps into the cabin but is knocked out by Dakota. Johnny revives and while he and Dakota fight on top of the cabin, Kit comes round and throws her knife at Dakota, causing him to fall into a ravine. Dawson and his gang then ambush the train but cannot catch up with it. However, they manage to shoot up the boiler and the train slows to a halt within sight of Tomahawk. A posse, headed by Marshall Dodge, rides out from the town and, together with the Araphoe, subdue Dawson's gang. Dawson flees but is pursued by Pawnee who throws a tomahawk at him which hits home off camera. As the train has stopped just short of its goal, Johnny talks the mayor of Tomahawk into extending the town limits, thereby fulfilling the requirements of the franchise. He does so, with seconds to spare. By now Kit has fallen in love with Johnny but he says he cannot be with her as he could not give up his travelling life. She grabs her knife and threatens to cripple him to stop his wandering ways. In the next scene it becomes apparent that Johnny is now working as a train conductor. As the train sets off he quickly limps after it, waving to his wife, Kit, and their five young daughters...\n\n\n"}

Miller and produced by Walt Disney Television. The film marked Newton-John's television film debut and her first film appearance in seven years since \"Two of a Kind\" (1983). It was written by Gerald Di Pego based on the book \"A Mom by Magic\" by Barbara Dillon and originally premiered on NBC on December 17, 1990.\n\nThe story revolves around 11-year-old Jessica Slocum (Juliet Sorci), whose mother died when she was three years old. Her father, Jim (Doug Sheehan), is a workaholic with little time for his daughter and hasn't been able to spend time with her since her mother's death 8 years prior and still seems to be mourning her. Just before the Christmas holiday season, Jessica wins a free wish from a wishing well. Her wish for a mother for Christmas is granted by Philomena (Doris Roberts) and Amy Miller (Olivia Newton-John), a department store mannequin, is brought to life to be a mom for Jessica. However, there is a catch and Amy can only be a mother to her until Christmas Eve.\n\nTo clear up any confusion for Jim, Amy claims herself to be a nanny from Australia hired to help care for Jessica while he's at work and she is given a spare room on top of the garage. Amy and Jessica get along until they suffer a brief misunderstanding. Jessica briefly wants to take back the wish and sees Amy go lifeless from her bedroom window. Horrified, she runs out in the rain and stairs to Amy's room, frantically knocking on her door. Amy opens up and Jessica is relieved to see her fine as she is ushered in. The next day, Jessica visits Philomena at the department store to see if she could take back the original wish. She wants Amy to stay forever with them because her father has grown fond of her and she can't bear to lose another mother. Philomena wishes she could help alter the wish, but shows Jessica what Amy will be up against if she isn't there to save her and other the mannequins with faces. The store she works at is planning to replace all the mannequins with faceless ones. Philomena tells Jessica there is only one way to avoid this and if she really wants to save Amy, they must act fast and join hands with her.\n\nThat isn't the only thing Amy is up against, an inquisitive store detective suspects her of taking a missing Santa mannequin (needed for Jessica's Christmas pageant) from the store and questions her. However, Amy's mannequin friends come to her aid, especially a male mannequin dressed as a driver who warns him to keep his distance from her. Amy and the Santa mannequin both help Jessica overcome her stage fright and put on a convincing performance that wow's the crowd. Jim takes a photograph of Jessica, his first picture of her since her mother died.\n\nChristmas Eve and Philomena is late to perform the ritual needed to save Amy so she has to return to the store. Jessica recruits Jim to help save her and they head to the store. By the time they reach the store, they see Amy having gone back to being a mannequin and Jessica throws herself at her. She begs her father to grab Amy's hand and he reluctantly does. The ritual works and Amy is brought back before them. They head for home and Amy's mannequin friends wishes her the best of luck in her new life, while the store detective is awakened by Philomena using her magic feather duster. The film ends with a Christmas picture of Jim, Amy and Jessica.\n\n\nOn October 21, 2008, \"A Mom for Christmas\" was released on DVD as a Disney Movie Club Exclusive, available only to club members for mail or online ordering.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2295250", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2295250", "title": "Smuggling organization", "text": "Smuggling organization\n\nSmuggling is a behavior that has occurred ever since there were laws or a moral code that tax or forbid access to a specific person or object. At the core of any smuggling organization is the economic relationship between supply and demand. From the organization's point of view, the issues are what the consumer wants, and how much the consumer is willing to pay the smuggler or smuggling organization to obtain it.\n\nThe Developmental Smuggling Model is a unified model in that it describes phases of smugglers and organizations. Smugglers are reported to fall within one of three different phases. Organizations in which there is smuggling occurring also fall within one of three different phases. Phase II is subdivided into three types of corporations.\n\n\"Phase I smugglers\" are usually smuggling contraband to meet their own needs although they might smuggle enough to cover their expenses by selling some of the contraband. Mules and those who meet law enforcement \"smuggler profiles\" fall within this cluster of individuals.\n\nOccasionally, individuals are enticed to carry contraband by more experienced smugglers because the professional smuggler wishes to test the security through which the mule must travel or to create a diversion when the novice smuggler is caught; thus, allowing a breach through which a larger shipment of contraband can be moved. Once the contraband is placed, the individual or family is referred to as the virgin (See Lichtenwald, 2003). The use of a \"virgin smuggler\" allows the professional smuggler to check his or her assessment of the security and to make sure that the contraband was not detected because \"the virgin smuggler\" could not control his or her emotions or behavior or because of the way the contraband was packaged, or because a bribe was not effective. The use of a \"virgin smuggler\" also allows the professional smuggler not to be identified.\n\nPhase I smugglers is the group most frequently caught by the police and government agencies. These agencies focus their security and enforcement efforts on arresting individuals within this group. In May 2005 the MITRE Corporation released a press announcement reporting that they had created a computer simulation program capable of modeling the complex adaptive behaviors of smugglers. The Modeling Complex Adaptive Behavior Project was headed by Daniel Venese and sponsored by MITRE's Center for Enterprise Modernization. The program is capable of generating a steady stream of novel smuggling techniques so that strategies can be crafted to combat them. Once an agency produces these strategies, it can feed them into the simulation to test how smugglers may adapt their methods in response. Information regarding The Modeling Complex Adaptive Behavior Project can be found in The MITRE Digest.\n\n\"Phase II\" smugglers are divided into two subtypes of individuals. Subtype 1 is a group of individuals who know each other and have a shared value system. The members of Subtype 1 often refer to each other as friends. Subtype 2 individuals belong to a group who have a shared value system but may not know each other as well. Subtype 2 may be a subgroup of coworkers or members of a group such as a gang or a more peaceful groups. When street gangs venture into smuggling they are a Phase II smuggling organization. The money the gangs make from smuggling is spent on supporting their criminal lifestyle. The members of Subtype 2 may have applied for a specific jobs such as bag handlers or inspectors within an industry because it allows them to be in a position to engage in crimes such as smuggling.\n\nPhase II organizations fall into three different type of structures: \n\nThe Phase II smugglers is the group that \"receives the most media attention\".\n\n\"Phase III\" smugglers and organizations are formed for the sole purpose of smuggling. There are several factors that distinguish Phase III smugglers and organization from a Phase II smuggler and organization. The Phase III individual or business \"smuggles with sophistication\". In general, the individuals in Phase III are raised in an environment where smuggling is encouraged and considered an acceptable behavior. The individual is raised with a family history of smuggling. Phase III smugglers are very experienced at smuggling, (The smuggler captured and studied for two years in Lichtenwald's research (Lichtenwald, 2003, 2004) had worked his way up from a Phase I smuggling business to being made a member of a Phase II business, and then a Phase III smuggling organization).\n\nThe Phase III smuggling corporation is divided into formal departments such as counter intelligence, bribes, money laundering, and others. An example is when the smugglers purchase a trucking corporation that ships products such as fruits and vegetables that must be moved from location to location before an expiration date. Due to spoilage risks, the smuggling corporation can protest delays due to screening for contraband at entry ports. The smuggling corporation can select, based on their assessment of the risk of being caught, which shipments will contain the contraband. The smuggling organization invests in other businesses that offer smuggling opportunities. It may also engage in border jumping given specific opportunities. For example, when the radar balloons are not working, the smuggling organization may take advantage of the situation and jump the border.\n\nThe Phase III smuggling organization endears itself to the country from where the contraband is produced or taken and to the country that stores the contraband.

After Moss retired from the sport in 1963, Jo Bonnier succeeded him.\n\nThe organisation was disbanded during the 1982 Formula One season due to the sport's changing commercial arrangements and the conflict between the Formula One Constructors Association (FOCA) and FIA. It was replaced by the Professional Racing Drivers Association.\n\nNiki Lauda, Christian Fittipaldi, Michael Schumacher and Gerhard Berger re-established the GPDA over the 1994 Monaco Grand Prix race weekend, following the events of the preceding San Marino Grand Prix, which culminated with the deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger, during the Sunday race and Saturday qualifying respectively. Ironically, following the fatal accident of Ratzenberger and the serious accident of Rubens Barrichello during Thursday practice, Senna spent his final morning on the Sunday talking to former teammate and rival Alain Prost to discuss the re-establishment of the GPDA and had offered to take the Chairman role starting from the Monaco Grand Prix.\n\nIn 1996, the association was incorporated in the UK as a company limited by guarantee (\"Grand Prix Drivers Association Ltd\"). For the first time, the association had a formal constitution, and permanent offices in Monaco.\n\nMembership of GPDA is not compulsory. For example, during the 2013 Formula One season, only 19 out of 22 active drivers were members (with Kimi Räikkönen, Adrian Sutil and Valtteri Bottas being the exceptions). Joining the GPDA costs £2,000. It was announced on 13 December 2017 that all the drivers had signed up.\n\nGPDA members elect their representatives. Currently, there are three directors—Sebastian Vettel, Romain Grosjean and Alex Wurz, who also serves as chairman.\n\nDuring the 2005 season the GPDA became increasingly involved in the politics (and controversy) of Formula One.\n\nFollowing the , the GPDA issued a statement supporting the case of the Michelin teams in the FIA World Motorsport Council. Significantly, though the majority of drivers signed the statement, Michael Schumacher did not. He claimed that he was not asked to and would not have done so, in any event. The statement claimed that the FIA's proposed solutions to the problems experienced by the Michelin teams were unworkable. Schumacher claimed the problems at Indianapolis were technical rather than a safety issue.\n\nA meeting between the GPDA and FIA president Max Mosley, scheduled for the , was cancelled by Mosley because of statements made by David Coulthard. Mosley claimed Coulthard's statements to the media were a \"distortion\" of the purpose of the meeting and accused him of stirring up dissent. In retaliation the GPDA released a letter that had been sent to Mosley accusing him of jeopardising the GPDA's drive for improved safety:\n\nIn 2010, upon his return to the sport as a competitor, Michael Schumacher announced that he did not intend to join the GPDA. He subsequently became a \"silent member\" following discussions with GPDA directors (chiefly, Felipe Massa).\n\nThanks to the activism of the GPDA, the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps was boycotted in 1969 and the Nürburgring in 1970 and after 1976, over safety concerns.\n\nIn 2013, following a series of tyre blowouts at the British Grand Prix, tyre safety became a major issue, with the GPDA announcing through a statement that its member drivers would withdraw from the subsequent German Grand Prix unless remedial action was taken.\n\nIn May 2015, the GPDA and Motorsport.com joined forces to allow followers of the FIA Formula 1 World Championship to voice and share their opinions about the sport through an extensive worldwide survey for fans. More than 200,000 respondents participated in the survey.\n\nIn July 2015, following the death of Jules Bianchi, the GPDA announced that it felt a responsibility \"to never relent in improving safety\".\n\nIn March 2016, following changes to the qualifying system, the GPDA released an open letter written by Jenson Button, Sebastian Vettel and Alex Wurz on behalf of all drivers saying that the sport's leadership was broken, calling the decision making within Formula One 'obsolete' and 'Ill-structured'.\nThe GPDA believes that the decision making could 'jeopardise F1's future success'.\n\n\n"}

They owned approximately forty villages in the Bashgul valley and numbered about 40,000 (1890).\n\nThe upper part of the Bashgul Valley of Nuristan (Afghanistan) is known as Katirgul. It is called Lutdeh in Chitrali and \"Kantozi\" in Pashto.\n\nAccording to George Scott Robertson, the Katir \"Siah-Posh\" clan settled in Katirgul valley was called Kamtoz (or \"Camtoz\") in Pashto and Lutdehhchis in Chitrali (\"The Kafirs of the Hindukush, p 71\"). But American investigator \"Richard Strand's\" website suggests that the name \"Kamtoz/Kamtozi\" may apply to all Katirs of the former \"Siah-Posh\" group, including the Ramguli and Kulam Katirs\" .\n\nAlternative names for Kamtoz are \"Camtozi\", \"Kantozi\". \nDespite their fiercely independent nature, the Katis, together with the Kom tribe, were tributary to the Mehtar of Chitral. The nature of this tributary relationship was inconsistent because the Katis and Koms would often raid Chitrali territory for livestock and head-hunting. In retaliation the Mehtars would invade the Bashgul Valley and enslave entire villages. During the reign of Mehtar Aman-ul-Mulk the relationship was formalized and the Kafirs would pay an annual tribute of slaves.\n\nNumerous scholars have connected the names Katir/Kator/Kata and Kam/Kom with ancient Kambojas and identified the Kafirs, especially the \"Siah-Posh\" Kafirs, as having descended from ancient. The Kata Tribe also lives in Chitral and very much mixed with Chitralies. There is a popular stone by the name of Kata Boht situated in Ozhore (Juwara) Valley Chitral. The Kata Tribe also lives in Ozhore and also other part of Chitral. The other fact is the tribe lives in Gram; \"gram\" is a Nuristani word meaning \"village\". In ancient times, people were considered rich according to their ownership of animals or land. As the Kata tribe in Chitral was considered to be relatively rich, over time, Chitrali speakers began to use \"kata\" to mean \"rich\" or \"big\".\n\nKafiristan is a mountainous region of the Hindu Kush that was isolated and politically independent until the conquest by Afghan conquest of 1896. The region became a refuge of an old group of Indo-European people probably mixed with an older substratum, as well as a refuge of a distinct Kafiri group of Indo-Iranian languages, forming part of the wider Dardic languages. The inhabitants were known as \"kafirs\" due to their enduring Hinduism while other regions around them became Muslim. However, the influence from district names in Kafiristan of Katwar or Kator and the ethnic name Kati has also been suggested. The Kafirs were divided into Siyah-Posh, comprising five sub-tribes who spoke Lato language while the others were called Safed-Posh comprising Prasungeli, Wangeli, Wamais and Ashhkun.\nOzhor\n\nThe Nuristani/Kafir people practiced a form of ancient Hinduism, infused with accretions developed locally. Kafirs represent non-Rig Vedic Aryans, identical with the Dasas. That their ancestors were pre-Rigvedic Aryans can be inferred from lingusitic, ethnological and theological evidence. The Kafiri/Nuristani languages contain certain Indo-Aryan phoenetic features not found in Indo-Iranian languages. Their chief deity is Imra ie., Yamaraja which was brought there by the Dasas who worshipped Asuras especially Yama and Varuna. Another of their goddess Dhisana is identical to the marginalized Yama in the Rig Veda. They also worshipped Indra or Inthra.\n\nOn his way to India, Timur attacked the Siyah-Posh in 1398 A.D. after receiving complaints from the trading city of Andarab by raids from Kafirs. He penetrated it from Khawak pass and restored an old fortress there. Timur personally proceeded against the Kator and sent a detachment of 10,000 soldiers against Siyah-Poshas under Burhan Aglan and had the fort of Kator deserted by Kafirs destroyed while the houses of the city were burnt.\n\nThe Kafirs took refuge on top of a hill and many were killed in the ensuing clash. Some held out for three days but agreed to convert after Timur offered them the choice between death and Islam. They however soon apostatised and ambushed Muslim soldiers in the night. They were however repelled and a number of the Kafirs were killed, with 150 taken prisoner and later executed. Timur ordered his men \"to kill all the men, to make prisoners of women and children, and to plunder and lay waste all their property.\" His soldiers carried out the order and he directed them to build a tower of skulls of the dead Kafirs. Timur had his expedition engraved on a neighboring hill in the month of Ramazan. His detachment sent against Siyah-Poshas however met with disaster with Aglan routed and fleeing. A small detachment of 400 men under Muhammad Azad was sent and defeated the Kafirs, retrieving the horses and armour Aglan lost. Timur captured a few places later, though nothing more is stated, presumably he left the Siyah-poshas alone. He then proceeded to exterminate the rebellious Afghan tribes and crossed the Sindhu river in September 1398.\n\nThe territory between Afghanistan and British India was demarcated between 1894 to 1896. Part of the frontier lying between Nawa Kotal in outskirts of Mohmand country and Bashgal Valley on outskirts of Kafiristan were demarcated by 1895 with an agreement reached on 9 April 1895. Emir Abdur Rahman Khan invaded Kafiristan in the winter of 1895-1896 and captured it in 40 days according to his autobiography. Columns invaded it from the west through Panjshir to Kullum, the strongest fort of the region. The columns from the north came through Badakhshan and from the east through Asmar. A small column also came from south-west through Laghman. The Kafirs were converted to Islam and resettled in Laghman while the region was settled by veteran soldiers and other Afghans. Kafiristan was renamed as Nooristan.\n\nThe former Kafiristan Kafiri were renamed Nuristani (The Enlightened Ones) from the proper noun Nuristan (Land of Light). Presently they are known by Nuristani Kata or simply Kata.\n\nGeorg Morgenstierne visited the Bashgul Valley in 1929 during his field work on Nuristani (Kafir) languages. He encountered the two last remaining unconverted \"Kafir\" priests of the region, called Bagashai and Kareik. Both men were dead by 1935.\n\nAround 1890, the Katir Kafir \"division\" was further sub-divided as under:\n\n\n\n"}

The \"Forbes Media Guide Five Hundred, 1994\" states:\nPart provocateur and part historian, Fleming persistently challenges the status quo. Aggressively conservative, he presents exceptionally well-written and forceful arguments, placing his subjects in historical and theological contexts... Exercising a rare command of language, Fleming passionately defends unpopular causes. In taking a creative approach to his subjects, Fleming yields work that proves scholarly, readable, and provocative.\n\nThomas Fleming was awarded a doctorate in Classics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, completing his dissertation on Attic lyric poetry, and until joining a series of conservative groups, taught Latin at a small, private middle school in South Carolina. In addition to editing, Fleming writes on topics concerning the literature of pagan Greece as well as political issues.\n\nFleming was introduced to the paleoconservative public by Robert W. Whitaker of South Carolina in 1982. At that time, he was invited to contribute to Whitaker's book, \"The New Right Papers,\" which put together ways whereby conservative populists could be elected to office through an alliance of people from both parties in the Republican Party. Whitaker later joined the Reagan administration as a junior member.\n\nNow a recognized name in the conservative movement of the region where he lived, Fleming became a founding member and board member of the League of the South, from which he later resigned when controversy arose, as well as an affiliated scholar of its educational arm, the League of the South Institute. He was the founding editor of the \"Southern Partisan\" magazine, started in 1979, until he left when controversy arose there as well. In 1985, after the death of author Leopold Tyrmand, Fleming became editor of \"Chronicles Magazine,\" and in 1988 co-wrote \"The Conservative Movement\" with Paul Gottfried.\n\nAs of June 2015, Thomas Fleming is retired as editor of \"Chronicles\" magazine. As of the July 2015 issue of \"Chronicles\", the magazine's former Senior Editor For Books, Chilton Williamson Jr., is currently editor for the publication. Fleming continues to occasionally contribute articles to \"Chronicles\".\n\nCriticizing mass immigration into the United States, Fleming, in an essay in \"Immigration and the American Future\", writes how American elites peddle a form of propositionalism:\nThis abstract approach to assimilation derives, ultimately, from the conviction - as naive as it is chauvinistic - that America is an exceptional country, one not rooted in blood, soil, and kinship, but a nation “dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.” Proponents of this are quick to label the more old-fashioned view, that the nation is a metaphorical extended family, as bigotry, but no amount of repetition or rhetorical extravagance can disguise the dangerous logic that is at work. If I love my country because it is mine, I must be loyal to it, even when I disagree with its policies, but I do not necessarily regard it as superior to everyone else's country, and I may have no inclination to say that all other countries, to the extent that they are legitimate and worthy of respect, must approximate my own.\n\nHe then shows how it relates to immigration:\nBut that this is exactly what the advocates of the “propositional nation” do insist upon. The United States is not only the best nation in the history of the world, but also it is the beacon to all mankind, the natural home of all the good and decent people in the world and the enemy to all regimes that deny their subjects equal rights. Thus, by the same argument, a propositional nation is obliged to open its borders to strangers \"yearning to breathe free,\" but it is also justified in engaging in endless crusades to impose its propositions on the rest of the world.\n\n\"Chronicles Magazine\" often runs news articles of interest to the old right. Writing on Congressman Ron Paul and his bid for the presidency, Fleming states:\nDr. Paul has his zany side: He believes in the Constitution of the old American republic, and he actually thinks it has some relevance for America today. God bless him, I would vote for him if only for pretending to embrace such a heartwarming fantasy. As it is, I am convinced he believes what he says. (His candor and sincerity alone are enough to disqualify him as a serious presidential candidate in these United States.) Paul not only wants, in principle, to restore the republic but also opposes the continued erosion of states' rights and U.S. sovereignty.\n\nLike Paul, Fleming favors non-interventionism and has criticized the neoconservative foreign policy.\n\nFleming supports papal supremacy; urging for the submission and reunion of the Eastern Orthodox churches to the authority of the Catholic Church. He states:\nThe Eastern position, from fairly early on and down to fairly late, was unequivocal in acknowledging the primacy of the Roman bishop, and even today most Orthodox bishops and theologians I know concede that if the Church were reunited, the heir of Peter would preside over the meetings of the patriarchs – indeed, in some Eastern ecclesiastical disputes in recent years, appeals have been made to the Pope.\n\nFleming has made several controversial statements regarded by some as racist in nature, although he denies that he and most paleoconservatives support racism. Examples of incendiary comments include the following statements taken from his columns in \"Chronicles\":\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center has listed Fleming as a key intellectual in what it calls the \"neo-Confederate\" movement. In a 2002 article on the paleoconservative trend in right wing politics, the SPLC stated: \"While mainstream neo-conservatives are tight with the GOP, so-called paleocon intellectuals have carved a niche for themselves as staunch, old-right traditionalists who romanticize the pre-civil rights era South. Fleming, who is \"Chronicles\"' editor, has gone so far as to describe the 19th century Ku Klux Klan as a 'national liberation army.\n\nFleming has strenuously denied these allegations, writing:\nIt is an easy trick of propaganda to portray all natural affections in the dark colors of prejudice. Why would anyone like the South if it were not for slavery and Jim Crow? Who but an antisemite objects to the slaughter of the (semitic) Palestinians? Only a communist or a Jew would oppose the Führer. . . .\n\nThe average American does have a conservative heart, but his mind has been so addled by bad teachers, bad books, and bad ideas that he often feels guilty if he prefers to limit his charity to his neighbors, if he resents the money squandered on public schools, if he does not share in the general glee over the massive immigration that is transforming the country of his fathers into something he cannot recognize. He is easily intimidated when the left condemns this vague, inchoate mixture of family loyalty and patriotism as the bigotry of the \"extreme right.\" In fact, the ultraleft Southern Poverty Law Center is always railing against \"right-wing extremism,\" by which they mean everyone to the right of \"The New Republic\"—up to and including Matthew Hale. . . .\n\nWhy should any conservative care if he is attacked by the leftists of the SPLC and ADL or those of the \"New York Times\"? These people have lies in their mouths, blood on their hands for the great genocides of the 20th century, and guilt on their consciences for the seduction of the innocent and the destruction of our civilization. Our task, as our late friend Mel Bradford put it, is to remember who we are and stop our ears against the siren songs of the revolutionists, which have proved to be not the anthems of a new dawn but a message of hate and filth that leads to destruction.\n\n"}

Chángquán is often identified as the representative Northern style and forms a separate division in modern Wushu curriculum.\n\nNorthern styles exhibit a distinctively different flavor from the martial arts practiced in the South. In general, the training characteristics of northern styles put more focus on legwork, kicking and acrobatics. The influence of Northern styles can be found in traditional Korean martial arts and their emphasis on high-level kicks.\n\nIt has been suggested that the presence of high kicks and flying kicks found in Southern styles, in Okinawan martial arts, and hence in modern non-Chinese styles such as karate and taekwondo (and by extension modern kickboxing) are due to influence from northern styles during the first half of the 20th century.\n\nThe Northern Shaolin style of kung fu is one of the most prominent traditional northern styles of Chinese martial arts. The northern styles of kung-fu generally emphasize long range techniques, quick advances and retreats, wide stances, kicking and leaping techniques, whirling circular blocks, quickness, agility, and aggressive attacks.\n\nThe system teaches empty-hand techniques and weaponry through predetermined combinations, known as forms, routines, or movement of sets. The students learn the basics by practicing the routines until the movements in the routines can be executed naturally based on instinct. Then, two or multiple man sets are practiced to train responses and applications of techniques learned from the sets. The practice sets/routines are not only practical in applications but are also graceful and artistic in nature. The fluidness of the movements combined with acrobatic techniques are trademarks of the Northern Shaolin sets.\n\nThe Northern Shaolin style was made famous by the late Gu Yu-jeung. Many legends tell of Gu's feats; according to tales related by his close students, Gu's father was an accomplished exponent of the Tan Tui (\"springing leg\") form. When he was young, Gu traveled throughout Northern China to learn all the northern kung fu systems. He was renowned for his Iron Palm techniques and the application of the long spear. He organized all his learnings into what is today's Northern Shaolin style.\n\nThe monastery in Henan is the original Shaolin Monastery. The monks began to practice military weapons sometime around the Tang Dynasty and became famous for aiding the future Emperor Li Shimin in struggles against rebellious forces. The monks were primarily known for their spear and staff techniques until the Ming-Qing transition when they began to specialize in unarmed combat. As the reputation of the Shaolin martial arts grew during the following centuries, its name became synonymous with martial arts, regardless of whether an individual art traced its origins to the Shaolin Monastery in Henan or not. As a result, the \"Shaolin\" moniker was applied to other Buddhist temples with strong reputations for martial arts. The characteristics of the martial arts taught at each temple were so different from each other that they became identified with their place of origin.\n\nThe Northern Shaolin (北少林 denotes Henan 河南崇山少林寺 temple) style associated with Gu Ruzhang was first taught to a lay disciple, the celebrated 18th century master Gan Fengchi of Jiangsu Province, by a Shaolin monk named Zhao Yuan, born Zhu Fu, a member of the Ming royal family who joined the sangha after the Ming was overthrown by the Qing in 1644. (Gan is also remembered for founding the martial art Huāquán 花拳, literally \"flower fist\", about which he wrote the book \"Introduction to Huāquán\".) Gan in turn taught Wan Bangcai, who taught Yan Degong, who taught Yan Sansen, who taught Yan Jiwen, who taught his nephew Gu Ruzhang.\n\nGeneration 1-8\n\nYán Jīwēn also taught Gu the skills of Iron Body and Iron Palm. On a famous occasion in 1931, Gu is said to have demonstrated the latter on a horse.\n\nAmong the martial artists who gathered at the Central National Martial Arts Institute in Nanjing in 1928, Gu placed in the top fifteen and was included—alongside Fu Zhensong, Li Xianwu, Wan Laimin, Wan Laisheng, and Wong Shao Chou (on other accounts, Wan Laiping)—in the Five Southbound Tigers (五虎下江南, Pinyin Wǔhǔ Xià Jiāngnán; literally, \"five tigers heading south of the great river\"), five masters of the Northern Chinese martial arts sent to Guangzhou (Canton) to organize another National Martial Arts Institute. In Guangzhou, the name \"Shaolin\" 南少林寺福建省(refer to South Shaolin temple in Fukian province—being sub temple from the Northern one) was already associated with Hung Gar and other styles, so Gu's style came to be known by the name \"Northern\" Shaolin.\n\nNote that some heirs to Gu's tradition teach these routines in a different order, particularly those under 陳國偉.\n\nThese are the 10 forms as standardized by Gu, comprising the \"core\" of the system, sometimes known as the Ten Classical Forms. They are standard in all of Gu's Northern Shaolin Kung Fu lineages. However, as mentioned above, they are sometimes taught or learned in differing orders. As with many different martial arts, from lineage to lineage, one may find slight differences in the way the movements are expressed.\n\nStudents learning this style usually do not only learn the 10 core forms however. There are often additional teachings such as introductory material and forms, weapons forms, qigong, etc.\n\n"}

The film's cast includes Joe Mantegna, William H. Macy, and Ving Rhames. It was entered in the 1991 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nBobby Gold is a homicide detective on the trail of Robert Randolph, a drug-dealer and cop-killer on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List. En route to nab an accomplice of Randolph, Gold and his partner Tim Sullivan happen upon a murder scene: the elderly Jewish owner of a candy store in a ghetto has been gunned down, reportedly for a fortune hidden in her basement. The deceased woman's son, a doctor, uses his clout to have Gold assigned to the case in the belief that Gold, himself Jewish, might be empathetic to his plight. Gold, however, seems to disregard his ethnicity and is irritated about being pulled off a much higher-profile case. Ultimately, though, this is offset by interactions with members of the Jewish community that play on Gold's feelings of inadequacy and inability to fit in.\n\nA nighttime survey of the crime scene uncovers an important piece of the woman's past, and Gold's reluctance turns to curiosity, leading to the discovery of a Zionist organization operating in the city. The apparent power and sense of pride these people have is appealing to Gold, and he attempts to become a part of their group. Gold is thrust into a series of circumstances that test not only his loyalty to the badge, but also his newfound Jewish consciousness.\n\nRoger Ebert praised it, giving it four stars out of four.

From its roots in South Africa, Vodacom has grown its operations to include networks in Tanzania, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mozambique, and Lesotho, and provides business services to customers in over 32 African countries, including Nigeria, Zambia, Angola, Kenya, Ghana, Côte d'Ivoire, and Cameroon.\n\nIt was owned in a 50/50 partnership by the South African telecommunications giant Telkom and British multinational operator Vodafone. On 6 November 2008, Vodafone announced that it had agreed to increase its stake to 64.5%, and Telkom said that it would spin off its remaining holding by listing it on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE). On April 1 2011, Vodacom officially unveiled its new change in branding from blue to red, using the same style as its parent company, Vodafone.\n\nVodacom provides coverage to Mount Kilimanjaro, which was the highest point in the world to be covered by GSM, until Axiata (through its subsidiary Ncell) provided coverage at the top of Mount Everest, the highest point in the world. Vodacom was aided by its optimistic advertisements at the early stages of the democratic South Africa, including the \"yebo gogo\" campaign which is still in effect today in Africa. Vodacom is the leading cellular network in South Africa with an estimated market share of 58% and more than 103 million customers across Africa.\n\nVodacom provides 3G, 4G, and UMTS networks in South Africa, and also offers HSPA+ (21.1 Mbit/s), HSUPA (42 Mbit/s, 2100 MHz), Wi-Fi, WiMAX, and LTE services. Vodacom was the first cellular provider to introduce LTE in South Africa. On 21 October 2015, Vodacom launched its fibre product to the home user. On 7 April 2017, Vodacom's 4G+ network in Brooklyn Mall, Pretoria achieved 240 Mbit/s in a speed test.\n\nVodacom is a sponsor of many South African sports. \n\nIn provincial rugby union, they are the sponsors of the Pretoria-based Vodacom Blue Bulls and own the naming rights to the union's home stadium, Loftus Versfeld.\n\nAs part of their rugby union sponsorship portfolio, Vodacom has been the title sponsor of the Super Rugby tournament in South Africa since 1996.\n\nIn football, they sponsor two clubs in the Premier Soccer League: the Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates. They also sponsor the South African Football Association and the national teams Bafana Bafana (men), Amajita (under 20s), and previously Banyana Banyana (women). However, competitor MTN was one of the sponsors of the 2010 FIFA World Cup held in South Africa.\n\nPast sponsorships include the national rugby union team, the Springboks, from 1994 to 2017, and the South African Shelby Can-Am series between 2000 and 2005.\n\nOn May 17, 2009, a court dismissed a joint Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) and ICASA application to stop Vodacom's JSE listing. Chegoane Mabelane, the South African article writer and prominent supporter of both African National Congress (ANC) and its alliance; in one of his articles stated that the interdict to stop the listing was fair.\n\nIn January 2010, the \"Sunday Times\" alleged that Alan Knott-Craig (Senior), former Vodacom CEO, helped his son, Alan Knott-Craig with business ventures using Vodacom's resources. He also allegedly awarded a multimillion-rand contract to a marketing and advertising company run by his family members.\n\nIn 2008, former employee Nkosana Makate took Vodacom to court, claiming that the profitable \"Please Call Me\" message service was originally his invention and demanding compensation. Eight years later, Makate eventually won his case in the Constitutional Court. Makate then entered negotiations with Vodacom for a 15% cut of the R70 billion ($ billion) he claims \"Please Call Me\" has earned for Vodacom since its inception.\n\nA 2014 judgement in the South Gauteng High Court supported Makate's claim to having originated \"Please Call Me.\" The court heard that, in November 2000, Makate had shared his idea (initially termed the \"buzz\" idea) with Philip Geissler, then board member and director of product development and management at Vodacom. Geissler had agreed to give Makate a cut should the \"Please Call Me\" innovation prove a success (however, there was no such agreement, written, oral, or implied – and no evidence to support it). Makate's witnesses presented emails sent by Geissler (Geissler was never called to testify by either party, raising suspicion that both parties would not have benefited from what Geissler would say under oath) and an article in Vodacom's \"Talk Time\" internal newsletter (such newsletter was written, edited, and printed by a third party in Cape Town) which acknowledged and praised Makate for his idea and his contribution to the product.\n\nThe court also rejected former CEO Alan Knott-Craig (Senior)'s claim that he had come up with the idea. Knott-Craig had published the claim in his autobiography, and later repeated in court, that he had the idea while watching two security guards trying to communicate on phones without airtime. Yet the High Court found against Makate's claim for compensation, holding Vodacom's argument that Geissler had not had the authority to promise Makate such compensation and that the debt would have expired (in legal terms, been prescribed) within three years.\n\nMakate took the case on appeal, and then took it to the Constitutional Court. In April 2016, Justice Chris Jafta found in Makate's favour and against Vodacom, overturning both judgements by the High Court, finding that Geissler had the authority to promise compensation, and that Makate's case was not based on an unpaid debt. In Jafta's words: “In not compensating the applicant [Makate] […] Vodacom associated itself with the dishonourable conduct of its former CEO, Mr Knott-Craig and his colleague, Mr Geissler, and this leaves a sour taste in the mouth. It is not the kind of conduct to be expected from an ethical corporate entity.”\n\nIn an open letter to Makate on Facebook, civic society non-profit Right2Know congratulated Makate. Right2Know used the letter to draw attention to the hypocrisy of multinational corporations which claim to support young black South African innovators such as Makate, but whose anti-competitive practices often strangle meaningful innovation. The letter also drew attention to the fact that South Africa's telecommunications duopoly (Vodacom–MTN) had led to the kind of unaffordable tariffs which made the \"Please Call Me\" service so successful with impoverished consumers in the first place.\n\nIn October 2013, Vodacom announced it would be acquiring Neotel in a potential US$590 million deal. Even though regulatory approval by the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) was obtained in 2015, the deal ultimately collapsed in March 2016 after competitors successfully challenged the transfer of Neotel's licenses and spectrum to Vodacom in court.\n\nAs at March 2014, the companies that comprised the Vodacom Group include, but are not limited, to the following:\nThe shares of Vodacom Group are listed and traded on the JSE, under the ticker symbol: VOD. The shareholding in the group's stock was as depicted in the table below in March 2018:\n\nInstitutional investors include, in order of held stock, the Public Investment Corporation (also known as PIC, wholly owned by the South African Government), Lazard (US), Blackrock (US), The Vanguard Group (US), Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (also known as GIC, Singapore), Old Mutual (ZA), Abax (ZA), Sanlam (ZA), and State Street Global Advisors (US).\n\nVodacom launched iPhone 7 in South Africa on 14 October 2016. It launched the iPhone Xs and Xs Max on 28 September 2018 starting at R21,999 ($1,650).\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S8 was officially launched on 5 May 2017.\n\nIn 2017, TechCrunch reported that Vodacom partnered with GameMine in a $20 million deal to install subscription-based mobile games on Vodacom's smartphones.\n\n\n"}

The island is about 25 km in length and 19 km in width. In the centre is an active volcano with two nested calderas.\n\nThe land is covered with the volcanic andesitic lava. The soil is very fertile and used for growing food crop and cash crop. The island is full of betel-nut, mustard plant and lime. The island is also known for the view from the mountain looking down to Madang town.\n\nThe latest eruptions on this island occurred in the 1970s. The 1974–1975 eruption produced a large volume of lava which covered almost 70% of the inner caldera's floor, while 1979 produced no lava flow, but killed the two volcanologists, Robin Cooke and Elias Ravian. The volcano erupted as recently as February 26, 2013.\n\nThe population of approximately 70,000 is mostly Lutheran and Catholic and speaks the two languages Waskia and Takia. Most people also speak Tok Pisin, and English is taught in the schools. Neighboring islands are Bagabag (Papua New Guinea) and Manam.\n\nA single road runs around the entire length of the island. Karkar Secondary School is the only high school. There is one hospital, Gaubin Hospital, known formally as the Edwin & Tabitha Tscharke Memorial Hospital, which is run by the Lutheran Health Service and staffed by several rotating German doctors. The hospital includes a training center for Community Health Workers.\n\nThe two main exports from the island are cacao and coconuts, which can grow in the same soil due to vast height differences. Large plantations are generally family-owned.\n\nThe first recorded sighting by Europeans of Karkar Island was by the Spanish navigator Iñigo Órtiz de Retes on 10 August 1545 when on board of the carrack \"San Juan\" tried to return from Tidore to New Spain.\n\nIt was later visited by Willem Schouten and Jacob le Maire and called \"High island\". In 1643 Abel Tasman passed the island. William Dampier visited the island, probably in 1699. The volcano erupted in 1895.\n\nDuring World War II, the Imperial Japanese occupied the island. The Australian 37th/52nd Battalion landed on 2 June 1944, to find that the Japanese had evacuated the island and Australian 5th Division troops landed on the island at Biu Bay and Kavilo Bay on 6 June 1944.\n\nAn excellent account of the history of Karkar Island, from the 1920s to the present day, is provided in the autobiography of Sir John Middleton Kt, OBE, \"My Life on Karkar Island, Papua New Guinea\".\n\n"}

Each dose then begins working in about ten minutes to two hours depending on the formulation, with a duration of effect of about five hours.\n\nA formulation that can be given in an intra-intestinal pump, known as Duodopa, is being developed.\n\nOther uses include for dopamine-responsive dystonia (DRD) and restless legs syndrome.\n\nThere is tentative evidence that it is useful in amblyopia when used with other treatments.\n\nCommon side effects include movement problems, and nausea. Most common early side effect is hallucinations, as movement problems manifest 5–10 years after initiation of treatment. More serious side effects include depression, low blood pressure with standing, sudden onset of sleepiness, and the compulsion to gamble, engage in sexual behavior, or other risk-taking behavior.\n\nLevodopa is converted to dopamine via the action of a naturally occurring enzyme called DOPA decarboxylase. This occurs both in the peripheral circulation and in the central nervous system after levodopa has crossed the blood brain barrier. Activation of central dopamine receptors improves the symptoms of Parkinson's disease; however, activation of peripheral dopamine receptors causes nausea and vomiting. For this reason levodopa is usually administered in combination with a DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor (DDCI), in this case carbidopa, which is very polar (and charged at physiologic pH) and cannot cross the blood brain barrier, however prevents peripheral conversion of levodopa to dopamine and thereby reduces the unwanted peripheral side effects of levodopa. Use of carbidopa also increases the quantity of levodopa in the bloodstream that is available to enter the brain.\n\nIn 1960 the Austrian biochemist Oleh Hornykiewicz, while at the University of Vienna, examined results of autopsies of patients who had died with Parkinson's disease. He suggested that the disease was associated with, or caused by, a reduction in the levels of dopamine in the basal ganglia of the brain. Since dopamine itself did not enter the brain, he tried treating twenty patients with a racemic mixture of dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), which could enter the brain and be converted there to dopamine by the action of DOPA decarboxylase. His results were positive, as were those of another trial in Montreal run by André Barbeau. Unfortunately, other investigators were unable to replicate these early results, and the use of DOPA remained in question until 1967, when George Cotzias at the Brookhaven National Laboratories in Upton, New York, used megadoses of DOPA, up to 16 grams per day. Not long after these results became known, Curt Porter at Merck showed that L-DOPA was the active stereoisomer, thus reducing the effective dose to half.\n\nWith L-DOPA identified as the active form, Alfred Pletscher and his colleagues at Hoffman-LaRoche synthesized benserazide, an inhibitor of DOPA decarboxylase, which further reduced the required dose. A drug combining L-DOPA with benserazide was marketed under the brand name of Madopar. Independent work was carried out by Victor Lotti at Merck in West Point, Pennsylvania. Merck had already synthesized and patented carbidopa, another dopa decarboxylase inhibitor in 1962, and in 1971 Lotti showed that the use of the L-form of carbidopa, further reduced the therapeutic dose of L-DOPA. The combination of L-carbidopa and L-DOPA was marketed under the brand name of Sinemet.\n\nIt is available as a generic medication and is moderately expensive. Globally, the wholesale price of the medication is about US$1.80 to $3.00 a month. In the United States a month's supply is about $50 to $150.\n\nThe generic name under the BAN system is Co-careldopa.\n\nIt is sold under several brand names, including Sinemet (Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited), Pharmacopa, Atamet, Apo-Levocarb, Duodopa, Kinson, and Pharmacopa, among others.\n\nExtended-release formulations are sold as Rytary and Sinemet-CR. An extended-release enteral solution is sold as Duopa.\n\nIn 1991, Merck licensed the rights to the manufacture and sale of Sinemet to a newly created joint venture, DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical Company. That same year, approvals for a sustained release formulation (Sinemet CR) which could be taken less frequently were also obtained. DuPont purchased Merck's share in the joint venture in 1998 and began operating the company as DuPont Pharmaceuticals (DuPont Pharma), but Merck continued to manufacture the drug for DuPont. Starting in late 2009 and continuing into 2011 Merck stopped manufacturing the drug while awaiting regulatory approvals due to a change in the supplier of the active ingredient. This resulted in shortages of the brand name products Sinemet and Sinemet CR, although alternative generic versions were still available.\n\nAnother shortage appears to have occurred at the end of 2017.\n\n\n"}

Stanković began his career at Red Star Belgrade, before joining Lazio in 1998. He spent more than five years with the latter club before joining Inter Milan, where he remained until his retirement in 2013.\n\nStanković grew up in Zemun, a municipality of Belgrade. Both of his parents, Borislav and Dragica, have strong football backgrounds. Stanković is renowned for being the only man to represent three different nations at FIFA World Cups – Yugoslavia, Serbia and Montenegro and Serbia.\n\nStanković began playing football for FK Teleoptik, based in his neighbourhood of Zemun. When spotted by Red Star cadet squad coach Branko Radović, however, 14-year-old Dejan transferred to Red Star Belgrade's youth system. Stanković then passed every age category at his hometown club. In the youth teams, he was coached by Vladimir Petrović, playing alongside future professionals Nikola Lazetić and Nenad Lalatović.\n\nDuring the 1994–95 season, Stanković's debut opportunity for first team action came under head coach Ljupko Petrović against crosstown rivals OFK Beograd on 11 February 1995. Fighting for a spot on the team led by, among others, Rambo Petković, Darko Kovačević, and Nebojša Krupniković, 16-year-old Stanković made seven league appearances that season as the team won league title. He scored his first goal against Budućnost Podgorica, soon becoming a first team regular and a fan favourite.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, Red Star was under an international ban because of a UN sanction imposed on FR Yugoslavia, meaning that the team could not compete in any European competition. The ban was lifted ahead of the 1995–96 season, and just a year later Stanković played a huge part in a memorable two-leg victory over 1. FC Kaiserslautern in the Cup Winners' Cup.\n\nBefore the start of the 1997–98 season, he was made squad captain at the age of 19, the youngest ever in the club's history. Despite not winning the league he captained the team to two domestic cup victories.\n\nIn the summer of 1998, Stanković transferred for ₤24 million to Lazio, where he scored on his Serie A debut versus Piacenza on 13 September 1998. In those years, Lazio had an all-star squad with world class players at almost every position, but Stanković quickly secured a regular first-team place despite competition from fellow midfielders Pavel Nedvěd, Juan Sebastián Verón and Diego Simeone. He formed a formidable midfield combination with Nedvěd, Veron and Simeone and were an integral part of the successful Lazio side at the turn of the decade. His work rate and impressive performances earned him the nickname \"\"Il Dragone\"\" (\"The Dragon\") from fans. He had five-and-a-half successful seasons in the \"Biancoceleste\" part of Rome before earning a high-profile move to Inter Milan in February 2004.\n\nAs Stanković began the 2003–04 season at Lazio, the \"Biancoceleste\" struggled with financial problems and were forced to sell many of their best players. Big name teams in European football knew that the club would have to sell the midfielder in the nearest future, so there was fierce competition for his services during the 2003–04 winter transfer window. Juventus were favorites in the chase for the Serb's signature with even some preliminary paperwork reportedly signed between the two parties in early January 2004, but the player eventually chose Inter Milan. He was signed as part of a deal worth €4 million, that also sent Macedonian international Goran Pandev (plus 50% of Pandev's contract) in the opposite direction.\n\nThe fact that his old friend, former teammate, and head coach from Lazio Roberto Mancini was already rumoured to be soon taking over the head coaching duties at Inter may have influenced Stanković's decision. In early February 2004, Stanković played his debut for Inter under head coach Alberto Zaccheroni, a Serie A clash at home against Siena that ended 4–0. On 21 February 2004, he scored a spectacular goal directly from a corner kick to put Inter 1–0 up in \"Derby della Madonnina\" versus fierce rivals Milan. Inter finished the league season in fourth place thus qualifying for Champions League. Still, Inter president Massimo Moratti was not convinced with Zaccheroni and at the end of the season, just like rumoured, brought Mancini from the financial shipwreck at Lazio.\n\nThe head coaching change suited Stanković just fine, and he got reunited with another familiar face from Lazio – Siniša Mihajlović. On 7 May 2006, Stanković played his 100th match for Inter. Coming off the summer appearance at the 2006 World Cup, he carried excellent form right from the start of the 2006–07 Serie A campaign, scoring some decisive goals. His strike against Catania and his memorable goal against city rivals Milan, only further enhanced his already glowing reputation with Internazionale fans. According to the official ratings of the \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\", Stanković was selected as the man of the match five times throughout the 2006–07 Serie A campaign. He renewed his contract on 2 February 2007, with Inter securing his services until at least 2010.\n\nWith the June 2008 arrival of José Mourinho to the position of Inter's head coach, there was a lot of press speculation about Stanković's exit from the \"Nerazzuri\" (along with Adriano, Hernán Crespo, David Suazo and Nicolás Burdisso) being imminent, due to reportedly not being held in high regard by the newly arrived Portuguese coach. A lot of the press' focus was also placed on Stanković's friendship with previous head coach Mancini and assistant coach Mihajlović, with veiled suggestions that it was this friendly relationship with the coaching duo that kept the Serb midfielder in the club, even when his performances were less than stellar throughout the 2007–08 season. Then in late June, after reports that Stanković was told by Mourinho that he would not be allowed to show up for the pre-season training in South Tyrol, and more reports that Stanković and Juve had agreed personal terms, it seemed that Stanković was definitely on his way out. The press reports of Stanković's pending arrival to Juve, sparked the club's fans into protests and online petitions, as they would neither forgive his turning down the club back in January 2004, nor his exuberant public celebrations after the 2005–06 Serie A title was stripped from Juve, and handed to Inter following the \"Calciopoli\" scandal. The Juve deal fell through within days for a variety of other reasons, and Stanković was suddenly reported to be happy to stay at Inter. However, the transfer talk was reignited again by Mourinho's suggestion in mid July 2008 that \"Stanković was not the same player that he was at Lazio\", which some took as a sign that the players Inter days were numbered, once again.\n\nStanković, however, remained with the club to fight for a spot on Mourinho's team, and soon after the season started, he managed to achieve his aim. On 19 October 2008, Stanković scored a superb goal in Inter's 4–0 hammering of Luciano Spalletti's Roma away at Stadio Olimpico. After receiving a pass from Sulley Muntari, he drove the ball past the Roma goalkeeper into the net, his 24th goal in all competitions for the \"Nerazzuri\", thus ending a year-long goal drought. The relief and vindication after everything he had gone through during the summer, was evident in his goal celebration, and in interviews after the match Stanković talked of his joy to be fully back on form, following the injury-prone previous season. He also thanked Mourinho for giving him an opportunity, even after the two did not get off on the right foot during the summer off-season.\n\nIn December 2008, Stanković, by now an irreplaceable part of Mourinho's midfield, gave another display of his rediscovered form versus Chievo at home: first with a through-pass to Maxwell for the game's opening goal, followed by a goal of his own for 2–0 with a first time shot from the edge of the penalty area, and finally an assist from the right wing to Zlatan Ibrahimović as Inter recorded a 4–2 win.\n\nOn 7 February 2009, Stanković celebrated his 200th appearance for Inter in all competitions at the away game versus Lecce. Inter hammered the newly promoted team 3–0 with Stanković heading in the third goal following a slick free-kick cross from Maicon. Stanković's season-long good form continued as he scored Internazionale's second goal against Milan in the 270th Milan Derby on 15 February. This turned out to be the winning goal after Alexandre Pato had pulled one back. Inter went on to win a fourth consecutive title, his fifth Serie A trophy.\n\nIn the Champions League, Inter limped into the second round after losing its final two group stage matches against Panathinaikos and Werder Bremen. In the first elimination round (round of 18), they lost to Manchester United in a hard-fought tie. Stanković played the full 90 minutes in the first leg at San Siro, putting in a very lively and active display. In the return at Old Trafford, Stanković started the match and had a great first half 37th minute effort after playing a one-two with Ibrahimović, and striking the ball with the outside of his boot from some 25 metres out, only to see it go centimeters wide of Edwin van der Sar's right post. Two minutes later, Stanković had another glorious opportunity when he got in behind Patrice Evra on the right, as Ibrahimović picked him out with a cross from the left, but the Serb did not make good enough contact with the ball in the one-on-one situation with Van der Sar, and the shot therefore went over the bar. In the 57th minute, with United leading 2–0, and Inter forced to chase the result, Mourinho took Stanković off and inserted striker Adriano. The match marked Stanković's 63rd Champions League appearance, thus overtaking Predrag Đorđević at the top of the list of Serbian players with most appearances in the competition.\n\nThe 2009–10 season began well for Stanković. In the Milan derby on 29 August, he played in a deeper role to replace the injured Esteban Cambiasso. Nevertheless, he scored Inter's fourth goal and his second in consecutive Milan derbies in a 4–0 thrashing, a spectacular 30-yard strike after quickly collecting Sulley Muntari's pass. He subsequently scored against Rubin Kazan and Udinese to continue his rich vein of form under José Mourinho.\n\nHe also scored a wonder-goal from 54 metres out in a 5–0 thrashing against Genoa, volleying the ball straight in from Marco Amelia's clearance.\n\nPlaying under new head coach Rafael Benítez, Stanković continued his usual midfield role. On 28 November 2010, Stanković netted a hat-trick in an emphatic 5–2 victory over Parma at the San Siro.\n\nAt the 2010 FIFA Club World Cup in Abu Dhabi in mid December, Stanković played an excellent semi-final against Seongnam, scoring the opening goal and turning in an all around midfield performance. Despite this, however, Benítez decided to bench the midfielder for the final versus TP Mazembe, only bringing him on for Christian Chivu in the 54th minute. Benítez was soon sacked despite winning the trophy, and a couple of weeks later Stanković expressed his dismay at Spaniard's decision to leave him on the bench for the final. On the same occasion, despite publicly backing the beleguerd coach months earlier, Stanković stated that Benítez simply \"didn't work\" at Inter.\nHe says that strong personalities crashed to each other's (Internazionale players after winning Champions League and strong personality of Rafael Benítez), so at the end Benitez departed after six months at the bench.\n\nUnder newly arrived head coach Leonardo, Stanković continued to be the automatic midfield choice, displaying his versatility (at times filling in for injured Wesley Sneijder in the midfield organizational role). Stanković scored his first goal under new coach at home versus Bologna in mid-January, and then continued with the same form away at Udinese, scoring the opening goal followed by hitting the post in a match that Inter lost 3–1. In Coppa Italia quarter-final at Napoli on 26 January, Stanković injured his thigh muscle that initially ruled him out for a month. However, he returned ahead of schedule for a Serie A match at Fiorentina on 16 February, putting in a lively performance with surging runs and two good scoring opportunities as Inter won 2–1 to come within five points of league leaders Milan. Inter made good recovery chasing the league-leaders AC Milan, getting within three points of them ahead of Milan derby, but lost disastrously 0–3.\nStanković scored a spectacular volley from the halfway line against Schalke 04 in the Champions League quarter-final first leg on 5 April 2011 as goalkeeper Manuel Neuer ran out of the box to make a daring header clearance that made it up to the halfway line, leaving an open goal as a target for Stanković's firm first-time volley. Inter, however, would lose that match 2–5 at home. On 19 April, in the Coppa Italia semi-final first leg, Stanković scored the winning goal with another spectacular long-range effort, hitting a sweet outside foot volley past the despairing dive of the goalkeeper.\n\nStanković made his international debut for the FR Yugoslavia team against South Korea on 22 April 1998, scoring two goals in a 3–1 victory. He played at the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000, for the Yugoslavia national team, and soon established himself as an important player.\n\nThe Yugoslav team was renamed Serbia and Montenegro by the time 2006 World Cup qualifying started, and Stanković started in all games and scored two goals, but missed the last qualifier through injury. At the 2006 FIFA World Cup, he was given the number 10 shirt and Savo Milošević captained the new Serbia and Montenegro team in their first World Cup, but they failed to progress to the knock-out rounds after losing all their group matches to the Ivory Coast, Argentina and the Netherlands. After Milošević retired, the midfielder took over as captain of the re-formed Serbia national team, following the breakup of Serbia and Montenegro.\n\nHe is the silver medalist Cyprus International Football Tournament 2009 .\nIn the 2010 World Cup qualifying, Stanković has started in and captained all but two of Serbia's matches. They qualified for their first World Cup as an independent nation. He was instrumental in their shock 1–0 win over favorites Germany, but they were not able to progress to the next round due to narrow losses against Ghana and Australia.\n\nAfter captaining the team in a 1-0 loss in the final game of the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying phase against Slovenia, Stanković announced his retirement from international football after 13 years since his debut against South Korea in 1998. After a few years of speculation as to whether or not he would play a testimonial match, he ended up doing so on 11 October 2013. Appearing in 103 matches, he is the most capped player for Serbia, playing one more match than Savo Milošević. His testimonial match was played against Japan, in which he played till the tenth minute, matching the number on his shirt, making room for Ivan Radovanović. He received a standing ovation as he said his final goodbye to football. Serbia went on to win the match 2–0.\n\nA talented player, Stanković usually played as an attacking midfielder, although he was a versatile player who was capable of operating in many different positions, and made a name for himself as a player who could also play out wide on the wings, or track back in a defensive midfield role. A tenacious and hard-working player, \"Deki\", as he is nicknamed, was best known for his efficient, accurate passing, versatility and creativity, as well as his ability to score goals, in particular from long distance; he was also effective in the air, and was known for his pace, skill, and influence on the pitch.\n\nOn 21 December 2019, Stanković was appointed as the head coach of the Serbian club Red Star Belgrade on a two-and-a-half-year contract.\n\n\"Source:\"\n\nRed Star Belgrade \n\nLazio\n\nInter Milan\n\n\n\nStanković was born in Belgrade, present day Serbia, to Bora and Dragica and has a brother Siniša. He is married to Ana Ačimovič, whom he met at the age of 19, and who is a sister of former professional footballer Milenko Ačimovič, Stanković's former teammate at Red Star. The pair has three sons; Stefan (b. 2000), Filip (b. 2002) and Aleksandar (b. 2005), and the family resides in Milan. All of his three sons are members of Inter Milan football academy.\n\nStanković and his family spend a lot of their free time in the Slovenian capital Ljubljana, the birthplace of his wife and residence of his brother-in-law Milenko. As of February 2014, Stanković has been playing amateur football for veteran's club KMN Olimpija Ljubljana, where he is playing alongside his brother in law and a number of former professional footballers (e.g. Sebastjan Cimirotič, Ermin Rakovič, Igor Lazič etc.).\n\n"}

The band consists of frequencies stretching from 28.000 to 29.700 MHz.\n\nThe 10-meter band was allocated on a worldwide basis by the International Radiotelegraph Conference in Washington, D.C., on October 4, 1927. Its frequency allocation was then 28,000-30,000 kc.\n\nA 300 kHz segment, from 29.700 MHz to 30.000 MHz, was removed from the amateur radio allocation by the 1947 International Radio Conference of Atlantic City. \n\nIn the late 1970s, the impending ban by the FCC of the sale of older 23-channel CB equipment that did not meet more stringent restrictions on newer, 40-channel units, meant that a surplus of 23-channel CB gear was on the market. This was a windfall for amateur radio enthusiasts, allowing access to fairly inexpensive radios which could easily be modified for use in the 10-meter band.\n\nAmerican Novice- and Technician-class licensees were granted CW and SSB segments on the 10-meter band as of 0001 UTC March 21, 1987.\n\nWith the elimination of Morse code testing requirements for U.S. amateurs in February 2007, Technician-class licensees who have not passed a code test may operate with up to 200 watts PEP using CW and SSB modes in a portion of the 10-meter band.\n\nBeing a very wide band in HF terms, many different transmission modes can be found on 10 meters. Morse code and other narrowband modes are found toward the bottom portion of the band, SSB from 28.300 MHz up, and wideband modes (AM and FM) are found near the upper part of the bottom portion of the band. Digital modes, such as PSK-31, are also allowed in the upper portion of the band, with 28.120 being a popular PSK-31 frequency.\n\nDue to its unique spot in the spectrum, 10 meters can occasionally be challenging to work. At peak times of the solar cycle when many sunspots appear on the Sun's surface, 10 meters can be alive with extremely long-distance signals, refracting from the F2 layer in the ionosphere. Generally speaking, the most effective and efficient propagation of 10-meter radio waves takes place during local daylight hours. During periods of increased sunspot activity, band openings may begin well before sunrise and continue into the night.\n\nLong-distance opportunities via F2 seem to follow the sun across the globe. In North America, for instance, F2 might bring Europe and western Asia in the morning, the Americas during midday, and the Pacific and East Asia in late afternoon and early evening.\n\nEven in times of solar minimum, when F2 is rarely available, 10 meters still has some long distance possibilities. Sporadic E propagation can bring in signals from a hundred to many thousands of miles away. Sporadic E on 10 meters is mainly a seasonal event, with late spring and early summer being prime time for the mode. A shorter, less-intense period occurs during mid-winter, often between Christmas and the new year. Other, off-peak openings may be seen almost anytime. Even during solar minimum, F2 openings often occur on transequatorial paths, for example between Europe and Southern Africa or between Pacific North America and the Eastern Pacific islands.\n\nIn tropical latitudes 10 meters is open throughout the sunspot cycle, although propagation is often confined to other areas lying along the equator. For example, a good path from West Africa to the Caribbean exists on 10 meters even at solar minimum.\n\nAlthough 10 meters has a worldwide amateur radio allocation, in some countries the use of portions of 10 meters is allocated by the government by license class, by signal mode or signal bandwidth. Beyond these regulations there is also a general voluntary band plan adhered to by amateurs throughout the world.\n\nWorldwide 10 meter frequency allocations are specified by the ITU. The Radio Regulations of the International Telecommunication Union allow amateur radio operations in the frequency range from 28.000 to 29.700 MHz.\n\nCanada is part of region 2 and as such is subject to the IARU band plan. Radio Amateurs of Canada offers the bandplan below as a recommendation for use by radio amateurs in that country but it does not have the force of law and should only be considered a suggestion or guideline.\n\nNamed for the segment of 10 meters granted for use to American Novice Class Amateur Radio license holders. The Novice sub-bands consist of two frequency ranges; one for CW and Data operation, and the other for SSB phone operation.\n\n28.000-28.300 MHz is a very active part of 10 meters for CW operation.\n\n28.300-28.500 MHz is probably the most active part of the 10-meter band. Operation in this segment is almost exclusively SSB worldwide.\n\nBecause the propagation on 10 meters can vary drastically throughout the day, propagation beacons are very important to gauge the current conditions of the band. With some differences in each ITU Regions and also from country to country, the beacon sub-bands fall between 28.100 MHz and 28.300 MHz. ITU Region 1 is generally 28.190 MHz - 28.225 MHz and ITU Region 2 is generally 28.200 MHz - 28.300 MHz.\n\nA list of 10-meter propagation beacons is available.\n\nFrom 29.000 to 29.200 MHz. Formerly-common practice was to use the band in 10 kHz steps: e.g. 29.010, 29.020, 29.030... etc. This has not been the case since the 1970s, which saw an influx of surplus 23-channel CB equipment modified for use on the 10-meter amateur band. The surplus equipment would land in 10 kHz steps on the 5 kHz step such as: 29.015, 29.025, 29.035, etc. Users of the surplus equipment also inherited those radios' odd channel spacing, which on CB skipped channels that were not used there, because they were set aside for remote control operations.\n\nFrom 29.300 to 29.510 MHz the satellite sub band allows amateur radio operators to communicate with orbiting OSCARs.\n\nMany amateur radio satellites have either an uplink or a downlink in the 29 MHz range. Information about particular satellites and operational modes is available from AMSAT. \n\nAs of the current writing, only AO-7's 10m downlink is active.\n\nFrom 29.510 MHz to 29.700, The FM sub-band is usually channelized into repeater and simplex frequencies. The channels are commonly grouped into repeater inputs, simplex, and repeater output frequencies.\n\nRepeater Input Channels:\n29.520, 29.540, 29.560, and 29.580 MHz.\n\nSimplex Channel, Worldwide calling FM: 29.600 MHz\n\nRepeater Output Channels:\n29.620, 29.640, 29.660, and 29.680 MHz.\n\nCommon practice for 10-meter repeaters is to use a 100 kHz negative offset for repeater operation. Due to the very few available repeater channels, \"odd-splits\" (offsets differing from 100 kHz) and non-standard frequencies are not uncommon. Since 10 meters can frequently open up to propagate globally, most 10-meter repeaters use a CTCSS sub-audible access tone. 16 kHz wide signals with 5 kHz deviation is normal in this band. 8 kHz narrow signals with 2.5 kHz deviation can also be found.\n\n29.300 MHz is a common frequency to find JA hams on. British hams commonly use the 29.400 to 29.500 MHz band for FM as well with 29.400, 29.450, and 29.500 MHz being common. USA hams can be found on FM anywhere above 29.000 MHz, commonly on the above frequencies talking to overseas hams. 29.200 to 29.300 MHz is set aside in some area band plans for FM Simplex use.\n\n\nDue to its unique nature, 10 meters has a large following of hobbyists who spend most of their time on this frequency band. The major group of enthusiasts is Ten-Ten which has been organized since the 1960s.\n"}

It is based on the 2004 novel of the same name by Tom Perrotta, who co-wrote the screenplay with Field. It stars Kate Winslet, Patrick Wilson, Jennifer Connelly, Jackie Earle Haley, Noah Emmerich, Gregg Edelman, Phyllis Somerville and Will Lyman. The original music score is composed by Thomas Newman. The film screened at the 44th New York Film Festival organized by the Film Society of Lincoln Center. It earned 3 nominations at the 79th Academy Awards: Best Actress for Winslet, Best Supporting Actor for Haley, and Best Adapted Screenplay for Field and Perrotta.\n\nSarah Pierce is a hapless, stay-at-home mother in a small suburb of Boston. She had been working on a doctorate in English, but set aside her work to marry Richard, and raise their 3-year-old daughter, Lucy. Her marriage falls apart when she discovers that Richard is addicted to online pornography. Sarah meets Brad Adamson, a law student who brings his 4-year-old son, Aaron, to the park. Brad is married to Kathy, and although their marriage is loving and amicable, it has been lacking intimacy.\n\nWhen Brad is supposed to be studying for the bar exam, he instead plays on a local football team or sits and watches teenagers skateboard outside his house, fantasizing about being young and carefree again. Brad and Sarah become friendly and, on a dare, kiss in the park, scandalizing the other park parents. They are instantly attracted to each other, but resolve to keep their relationship platonic. One day, several parents panic when they see sex offender Ronnie J. McGorvey, who was recently released from prison, swimming in the pool with the children. After Ronnie is escorted away by the police, it begins to rain.\n\nSarah and Brad take Lucy and Aaron back to her house and put the kids to bed. Brad looks at one of Sarah's books and finds a photo of him in it. While Sarah is drying towels in her basement, Brad kisses her and they have sex. Brad's friend, Larry Hedges, is a former police officer who was forced to retire when he accidentally shot a teenager at a local mall. Now he is estranged from his wife and spends much of his time harassing Ronnie. Ronnie lives with his mother, May, who believes that meeting a woman his own age would cure him of his pedophilia. Ronnie knows this is futile, but agrees to go on a date May has arranged for him with a woman named Sheila.\n\nDuring dinner, Ronnie tells Sheila about his criminal record, and Sheila in return tells him that she has had a series of nervous breakdowns. They seem to get on well, but the date ends badly when he has her drive by an elementary school playground so he can masturbate next to her in the car. When Brad skips taking the bar exam again, Kathy grows suspicious and tells Brad to invite Sarah, Richard, and Lucy over for dinner. The intimacy evident between Brad and Sarah confirms her suspicions, and Kathy arranges for her mother to come for an extended visit so Brad and Sarah can't see one another anymore. When Brad's football team plays its final game, Sarah attends and cheers as Brad scores the winning touchdown.\n\nAfterwards, while Larry waits for Brad at a nearby bar to celebrate their victory, Brad and Sarah make out on the field. He admits that this is the happiest moment of his life, and convinces Sarah to run away with him. Larry goes to Ronnie's house and uses a bullhorn to taunt him. May comes out to confront him and has a heart attack. Larry is arrested and May is taken to the hospital. While Ronnie sleeps in the waiting room, May dies. When Ronnie goes home, he finds an envelope containing a letter written by his mother saying: \"Please be a good boy.\" Distraught, Ronnie destroys much of his mother's collection of Hummel figurines, then takes a butcher knife from the kitchen.\n\nThat same night, Sarah and Brad agree to meet in the park to run away together. Brad tells Aaron he loves him before putting him to bed, writes Kathy a note explaining why he is leaving her, then sneaks out while she and her mother finish the dishes. Before he can get to the park, he is distracted by skateboarding teenagers, who convince him to try a jump himself. Brad does so, but falls and knocks himself out. When he regains consciousness, he asks the paramedics to call his wife and to meet him at the hospital. It turns out that he never left the note for her and tells one of the skateboarders to dispose of it for him.\n\nWhen Sarah takes Lucy to the park, she sees Ronnie stagger by, and briefly feels afraid. When she sees him crying about his mother's death, however, she feels sorry for him. When Lucy disappears, Sarah panics and rushes to find her, forgetting about Brad. After Sarah finds Lucy and puts her in the car, Sarah starts crying, realizing her getaway with Brad is just a fantasy. Larry is upset about having indirectly caused May's death. He genuinely wants to apologize to Ronnie, but when he finds Ronnie in the park, he discovers that he has castrated himself and is bleeding to death. Larry races him to the hospital, and they arrive just as Kathy meets Brad at the emergency room doors.\n\nFor this film, director Todd Field and novelist Tom Perrotta intended to take the story in a separate and somewhat different direction than the novel. \"When Todd and I began collaborating on the script, we were hoping to make something new out of the material, rather than simply reproducing the book onto film,\" says Perrotta.\n\nReviews of the film were generally positive. Based on 157 reviews collected by the film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 80% of critics gave \"Little Children\" a positive review (125 \"Fresh\"; 32 \"Rotten\"), with an average rating of 7.4/10. A. O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" wrote:\n\nScott later placed \"Little Children\" ninth on his list of the top 10 films of 2006.\n\nCarina Chocano of \"The Los Angeles Times\" also praised the film:\n\n\"Little Children\" was listed on many critics' top ten lists.\n\nThe film received multiple awards and accolades, including 3 Academy Award nominations.\n\n35mm safety prints are housed in both the UCLA Film & Television Archive and the Museum of Modern Art's permanent film collection.\n\nThe film's DVD release includes no extras or director's commentary.\n\n"}

He was hereditary Constable of England and Sheriff of Gloucestershire.\n\nHe inherited vast landholdings in Wales from his wife Sibyl de Neufmarché (whose father had conquered the independent kingdom of Brycheiniog (Brecknockshire, modern: Breconshire) in South Wales, which became the Lordship of Brecknock, and other lands in Gloucestershire from his father (the nucleus of which were the Domesday Book holdings of his great-uncle Durand of Gloucester) and acquired other large landholdings himself, including the extensive Lordship of Abergavennny in South Wales, and St Briavel's Castle and the Forest of Dean in the west of Gloucestershire. These combined lands became a feudal barony, now known as the \"Barony of Miles of Gloucester\".\n\nBy his three daughters and eventual co-heiresses his barony was split between the families of de Bohun, which inherited the fiefdom of Durand of Gloucester (Miles's great-uncle), the hereditary Constabulary of England and was re-created Earl of Hereford in 1200; de Braose, which inherited the Lordships of Brecon and Abergavenny; and FitzHerbert, which inherited Blaen Llyfni.\n\nIn 1136 he founded Llanthony Secunda Priory half-a-mile south of Gloucester Castle, in the chapter house of which he and many of his de Bohun descendants were buried. John of Salisbury classed him with Geoffrey de Mandeville, 1st Earl of Essex and others as \"non tam comites regni quam hostes publici\" (\"not so much earls of the kingdom as public enemies\"). The charge is justified by his public policy; but the materials for appraising his personal character do not exist.\n\nHe was the son and heir of Walter of Gloucester (d.1129), hereditary Sheriff of Gloucestershire in 1097 and in 1105–6, and Castellan of Gloucester Castle. Walter was also seemingly Constable of England under King Henry I (1100-1135), as he is described in an annal of Llanthony Secunda Priory (transcribed by Dugdale) as \"Constabularius, princeps militiae domus regiae, vir magnus et potens et inter primos regni praecipue honoratus\" (\"Constable, chief of the royal military household, a great and powerful man and amongst the first of the kingdom especially honoured\"). Some sources however suggest that Walter was merely the Constable of Gloucester Castle. Walter's wife (and Miles's mother) was a certain Berta. Walter was in favour with King Henry I (1100-1135), three of whose charters to him are extant. Walter's father was Roger de Pitres, Sheriff of Gloucestershire from about 1071, who at some time before 1083 was succeeded by his brother Durand of Gloucester (d. circa 1096), Sheriff of Gloucestershire at the time of the Domesday Book of 1086, who made Walter his heir.\n\nEarly in 1121 Miles married Sibyl de Neufmarché, daughter and heiress of Bernard de Neufmarché, the conqueror of Brycheiniog, which brought him her father's possessions (such as the new Lordship of Brecknock). In the Pipe Roll of 1130 Walter is found to have been succeeded by his son, having died in or around 1126.\n\nMiles was (from 1128 at least) sheriff of Gloucestershire, a justice itinerant, and a justice of the forest, and by 1130 was sheriff of Staffordshire. He had also (though the fact has been doubted) been granted his father's office of constable by a special charter. In conjunction with Pain fitzJohn, sheriff of Herefordshire and Shropshire, he ruled the whole Welsh border \"from the Severn to the sea\".\n\nOn his accession, King Stephen set himself to secure the allegiance of these two lords-marchers, who at length, on receiving a safe-conduct and obtaining all they asked for, did him homage. It was at Reading that they met the king early in 1136. Miles is next found attending the Easter court at Westminster as one of the royal constables, and, shortly after, the Oxford council in the same capacity. He was then despatched to the aid of the widow of Richard fitz Gilbert de Clare, who was beleaguered in her castle by the Welsh and whom he rescued.\n\nMeanwhile, Miles had married his son and heir, Roger, to Cecily, daughter of fitzJohn, who inherited the bulk of her father's possessions. In the same year 1136 Miles transferred the original house of Augustinian canons at Llanthony Priory, Monmouthshire to a site on the south side of Gloucester, which they named Llanthony Secunda.\n\nTwo years later (1138) Miles received, in his official capacity, Stephen at Gloucester in May. He has been said to have renounced his allegiance a few weeks later, but he was with Stephen in August (1138) at the siege of Shrewsbury, and his defection did not take place till 1139.\n\nIn February 1139 Stephen gave Gloucester Abbey to Miles's kinsman Gilbert Foliot at his request. In the summer of 1139, however, he joined his lord, Robert, Earl of Gloucester, in inviting Empress Matilda to England. On her arrival Miles met her at Bristol, welcomed her to Gloucester, recognised her as his rightful sovereign, and became thenceforth her ardent supporter. She at once gave him St. Briavels Castle and the Forest of Dean.\n\nMiles's first achievement on behalf of Matilda was to relieve Brian Fitz Count who was blockaded in Wallingford Castle. In November (1139) he again advanced from Gloucester and attacked and burnt Worcester. He also captured the castles of Winchcombe, Cerne, and Hereford. Meanwhile, he was deprived by Stephen of his office of constable. He took part in the victory at Lincoln (2 February 1141), and on the consequent triumph of the empress he accompanied her in her progress, and was one of her three chief followers on her entry (2 March) into Winchester. He was with her at Reading when she advanced on London, and on reaching St. Albans Matilda bestowed on him a house at Westminster. He was among those who fled with her from London shortly after, and it was on his advice, when they reached Gloucester, that she ventured back to Oxford. There, on 25 July 1141, she bestowed on him the town and castle of Hereford and made him earl of that shire, as well as the forests of the Hay of Hereford and Trinela in avowed consideration of his faithful service. With singular unanimity hostile chroniclers testify to his devotion to her cause. He even boasted that she had lived at his expense throughout her stay in England.\n\nAs \"Earl Miles\", he now accompanied her to Winchester, and on the rout of her forces on 14 September 1141 he escaped to Gloucester, where he arrived \"exhausted, alone, and with scarcely a rag to his back\". Towards the end of the year he was in Bristol making a grant to Llanthony Priory in the presence of the Empress Matilda and the Robert, Earl of Gloucester. In 1142 he is proved by charters to have been with the Empress at Oxford and to have received her permission to hold Abergavenny Castle of Brian Fitz Count. It is probably to the summer of this year that he made a formal deed of alliance with the Earl of Gloucester, and as a hostage he gave the Earl his son Mahel.\n\nIn 1143 Miles's pressing want of money to pay his troops led him to demand large sums from the church lands. Robert de Bethune, Bishop of Hereford, withstood his demands, and, on the Earl invading his lands, excommunicated him and his followers, and laid the diocese under interdict. The Earl's kinsman, Gilbert Foliot (Abbot of Gloucester), appealed to the legate on his behalf against the bishop's severity.\n\nOn Christmas-eve of 1143 he was slain while hunting by a stray arrow shot at a deer. A dispute at once arose for possession of his body between the canons of Llanthony Secunda, his own foundation, and the monks of Gloucester. The case was heard before the bishops of Worcester, Hereford, and St. David's, and was terminated by a compromise on 28 December. The Earl was then buried in the chapter-house at Llanthony.\n\nMiles was succeeded by his eldest son and heir, Roger Fitzmiles, 2nd Earl of Hereford, who died without an heir twelve years later in 1155, when the Earldom of Hereford became extinct. The shrievalty of Hereford and Gloucester passed to his younger brother Walter de Hereford. On the death of the latter and two other brothers without issue the family possessions passed to their sisters and their descendants, namely Bertha of Hereford who through her marriage brought Abergavenny to William de Braose, 3rd Lord of Bramber, and Margaret of Hereford, the eldest sister, taking the bulk (\"Liber Niger\") to Humphrey II de Bohun, later (1199) Earls of Hereford, and Constables of England, in recognition of their descent from Miles.\n\nIn 1121 he married Sibyl de Neufmarché, daughter and heiress of Bernard de Neufmarché (d.1125), Lord of Brecon, and Agnes or Nest, daughter of Osbern fitzRichard by his wife Nest, a daughter of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, King of Wales. By Sibyl he had issue including:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2295417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2295417", "title": "Inverted nipple", "text": "Inverted nipple\n\nAn inverted nipple (occasionally invaginated nipple) is a condition where the nipple, instead of pointing outward, is retracted into the breast. In some cases, the nipple will be temporarily protruded if stimulated. Both women and men can have inverted nipples.\n\nThe most common causes of nipple inversion include:\nAround 10–20% of all women are born with this condition. Most common nipple variations that women are born with are caused by short ducts or a wide areola muscle sphincter.\n\nInverted nipples can also occur after sudden and major weight loss.\nThe three grades of inverted nipples are defined on how easily the nipple may be protracted and the degree of fibrosis existent in the breast, as well as the damage it has caused on the milk ducts.\n\nInverted nipple grade 1 refers to nipples that can easily be pulled out, by using finger pressure around the areola. The grade-1 inverted nipple maintains its projections and rarely retracts. Also, grade-1 inverted nipples may occasionally pop up without manipulation or pressure. Milk ducts are usually not compromised and breast feeding is possible. These are \"shy nipples\". It is believed to have minimal or no fibrosis. There is no soft-tissue deficiency of the nipple. The lactiferous duct should be normal without any retraction.\n\nInverted nipple grade 2 is the nipple which can be pulled out, though not as easily as the grade 1, but which retracts after pressure is released. Breast feeding is usually possible, though it is more likely to be hard to get the baby to latch comfortably in the first weeks after birth; extra help may be needed. Grade 2 nipples have a moderate degree of fibrosis. The lactiferous ducts are mildly retracted, but do not need to be cut for the release of fibrosis. On histological examination, these nipples have rich collagenous stromata with numerous bundles of smooth muscle. \n\nInverted nipple grade 3 describes a severely inverted and retracted nipple which can rarely be pulled out physically and which requires surgery to be protracted. Milk ducts are often constricted, and breast feeding is difficult, but not necessarily impossible. With good preparation and help, babies often can drink at the breast, and milk production is not affected; after breastfeeding, nipples often are less or no longer inverted. Women with grade-3 inverted nipples may also struggle with infections, rashes, or problems with nipple hygiene. The fibrosis is remarkable and lactiferous ducts are short and severely retracted. The bulk of soft tissue is markedly insufficient in the nipple. Histologically, atrophic terminal duct lobular units and severe fibrosis are seen.\n\nIndividuals with inverted nipples may find that their nipples protract (come out) temporarily or permanently during pregnancy, or as a result of breastfeeding. Most women with inverted nipples who give birth are able to breastfeed without complication, but inexperienced mothers may experience higher than average pain and soreness when initially attempting to breastfeed. When a mother uses proper breastfeeding technique, the infant latches onto the areola, not the nipple, so women with inverted nipples are actually able to breastfeed without any problem. An infant that latches on well may be able to slush out an inverted nipple. The use of a breast pump or other suction device immediately before a feeding may help to draw out inverted nipples. A hospital grade electric pump may be used for this purpose. Some women also find that using a nipple shield can help facilitate breastfeeding. Frequent stimulation such as sexual intercourse and foreplay (such as nipple sucking) also helps the nipple protract.\n\nAnother method of protracting inverted nipples is to have the nipple pierced. This method will only be effective if the nipple can be temporarily protracted. If pierced when protracted, the jewellery may prevent the nipple from returning to its inverted state. The success of both of these methods, from a cosmetic standpoint, is mixed. The piercing may actually correct the overly taut connective tissue to allow the nipple to become detached from underlying connective tissue and resume a more typical appearance.\n\nOther strategies for protracting inverted nipples include regularly stimulating the nipples to a protruding state, in an attempt to gradually loosen the nipple tissue. Some sex toys designed for nipple stimulation, such as suction cups or clamps, may also cause inverted nipples to protract or stay protracted longer. Some special devices are specifically designed to draw out inverted nipples, or a home-made nipple protractor can be constructed out of a 10-ml disposable syringe. These methods are often used in preparation for breastfeeding, which can sometimes cause inverted nipples to become protracted permanently.\n\nTwo methods which are now discouraged are breast shells and the Hoffman technique. Breast shells may be used to apply gentle constant pressure to the areola to try to break any adhesions under the skin that are preventing the nipple from being drawn out. The shells are worn inside the bra. The Hoffman technique is a nipple-stretching exercise that may help loosen the adhesions at the base of the nipple when performed several times a day. Although both techniques are heavily promoted, a 1992 study found that not only do shells and the Hoffman technique not promote more successful breastfeeding, but they may also actually disrupt it.\n\n"}

Earl grew up in Hendon and was educated at the local school, but also travelled around a great deal in the UK, Europe and the United States, following his father's career.\n\nEarl graduated from the University of Surrey with an honours degree in Hotel and Catering Management. In 2012, he set up the Robert Earl Scholarship, awarded each year to 14 students across the School of Hospitality and Tourism Management, worth up to £2,500 each.\n\nEarl was named one of \"The 25 Most Influential Americans\" by \"Time\" in 2001.\n\nEarl began his career with his first Beefeater medieval theatre-themed restaurant in 1972. With its success, Earl opened additional themed restaurants, The Cockney Club, Shakespeare's Tavern, and Talk of London, close by in the late 1970s. Seeing the US market as having more growth potential, he attempted to sell the concepts to developers working on the Disney's EPCOT, but the deal fell through. He stayed to opened several theme-restaurants with medieval and Wild West concepts in the Orlando market. Amongst those themed restaurants in central Florida were Caruso's Palace (now Race Rock), King Henry's Feast and the original Shakespeare's Tavern on Church Street.\n\nEarl quickly grew the business into a restaurant empire totalling 70 restaurants by the time he merged his company President Entertainment with Pleasurama PLC, a London-based leisure group, in 1987. The transaction yielded Earl $63 million.\n\nJoining the board, he was tasked to undertake the purchase of Hard Rock Cafe. After quickly becoming the brand's CEO, Earl grew Hard Rock from 7 to 22 units in just 5 years, resulting in the eventual sale of the brand to Rank Group. Earl was also a director of Pelican Group PLC, which owns the Café Rouge, Dôme, and Mamma Amalfi brands. leaving the company after its sale to Whitbread PLC.\n\nIn 1991, Earl founded Planet Hollywood, negotiating celebrity investments from Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis, and partnerships including Demi Moore, and Sylvester Stallone.

It is known on the air as B96 and it is owned by Entercom. The station has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 3,300 watts, broadcasting from a transmitter atop the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower). The studios and offices are located at Two Prudential Plaza in the Loop. WBBM-FM's main competition is 103.5 WKSC-FM, owned by iHeartMedia.\n\nThe station began experimental broadcasts in November 1941, as W67C, broadcasting at 46.7 MHz. The station's transmitter was located atop the American National Bank Building, at 33 N. LaSalle Street. It simulcast co-owned WBBM AM 780, carrying its CBS Radio Network schedule of dramas, comedies, news, sports, game shows, soap operas and big band broadcasts during the \"Golden Age of Radio.\" \n\nIn 1943, the station's call sign was changed to WBBM-FM. In 1946, the station began broadcasting at 99.3 MHz. In 1947, the station's frequency was changed to 97.1 MHz, and in 1953 WBBM-FM moved to its current spot on the dial at 96.3 MHz. In the 1950s, as network programming moved from radio to television, WBBM-AM-FM carried a full service middle of the road format of popular music, news and talk. After 1964, most of the music was eliminated, in favor of talk and news.\n\nIn 1966, WBBM-FM split from simulcasting the AM and flipped to \"The Young Sound,\" a format pioneered by John DeWitt for co-owned WCBS-FM in New York City. Bud Kelly was the announcer for \"The Young Sound\" on WBBM-FM. \n\n\"The Young Sound\" aired instrumental cover versions of recent hits, contemporary pop instrumentals from artists like Herb Alpert, and contemporary vocal hits from artists like Petula Clark. Every hour's playlist was designed so that each song would complement the titles that preceded and followed it. Initially, the station had a three to one instrumental to vocal ratio. However, its playlist was skewed towards a young audience, which distinguished it from most easy listening and beautiful music stations of the era.\n\nBy the early 1970s, the station was airing a format consisting of top 40, album cuts, and past hits. The station was branded as \"Stereo 96 WBBM-FM, Chicago's Favorite Rock!\" Bob Johnston served as program director.\n\nIn 1971, the station's transmitter was moved to the John Hancock Center.\n\nBy 1977, WBBM-FM and several other FM stations owned by CBS had adopted an adult contemporary format defined as the \"mellow sound\", playing contemporary music but without the harder-edged titles. During this era, the station was branded as \"The Mellow Sound of Chicago\" and \"Soft Rock 96\". Initially, all of CBS's \"mellow sound\" stations were automated.\n\nDick Bartley, who later became a popular syndicated radio personality, spent time at WBBM-FM as program director and morning disc jockey in the late '70s. WBBM-FM briefly carried \"American Top 40\" with Casey Kasem during the soft rock years.\n\nIn May 1982, WBBM-FM began airing a Top 40/CHR format known as \"Hot Hits,\" which was created by consultant Mike Joseph. Concurrent with the format change was the phase out of all automation. Hot Hits was a high energy format, playing only current hits, and featured numerous jingles to reinforce the station's identity. The station was branded B96 the following year. \n\nIn 1986, WBBM-FM started to move toward a rhythmic top 40 direction, and in the late 1980s began to embrace dance product. In 1990, the station became known as \"The Killer Bee: B96.\" In 1995, the station added more R&B and Hip hop music acts as the dance scene diminished.\n\nIn October 2008, the station's slogan was changed from \"Chicago's Hits and Hip-Hop\" to \"Chicago's #1 Hit Music Station,\" as its format shifted back to mainstream Top 40.\n\nSince 1992, the station has presented the B96 SummerBash concert.\n\nB96's longtime morning program was the \"Eddie & JoBo\" morning zoo show. Joe Colborn (air name \"Bohannon\") first signed on at B96 in 1984 hosting evenings as \"JoBo In Chicago.\" Ed Volkman started at B96 in 1986 hosting morning drive along with Karen Hand and Mike Elston. When Elston left B96 in 1988, Bohannon was moved to mornings along with Volkman and Hand, launching the \"Eddie & JoBo\" show. The morning show ran for two decades but was canceled on November 21, 2008.\n\nOn January 5, 2009, Julian Nieh and Jamar \"J. Niice\" McNeil started a new morning show, \"J. Niice & Julian on the Radio.\" The two were previously together at iHeartMedia's WIHT in Washington, D.C. Nieh stayed with the show until December 2012. The show continued with the name \"The J. Show with Showbiz Shelly\", with J. Niice as the main morning host. J. Niice left the morning show in March 2018, and was replaced by DreX, who was partnered with Nina Hajian and Gabe Ramirez. DreX left B96 in February 2019, and the show became the \"Gabe and Nina\" show.\n\nCBS had owned WBBM-FM since its beginnings. In 1995, CBS was acquired by Westinghouse. Infinity Broadcasting Corporation was acquired in December 1996, and shortly thereafter Westinghouse's name was changed to CBS Corp. Through its CBS Radio division, the CBS Corporation owned WBBM-FM for 76 years. \n\nOn February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom, no longer a part of the CBS Corporation. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th.\n\nWBBM-FM broadcasts in the HD Radio format. The HD2 subchannel carries a national LGBTQ talk and EDM radio format called \"Channel Q.\"\n\nIn January 2006, the station officially launched its HD2 FM subcarrier, airing a Dance Top 40 format as \"B96 Dance\". That format moved to a subchannel on co-owned 105.9 WCFS-FM in February 2019 and rebranded as \"Energy.\" WBBM-FM's HD2 subchannel then switched to an Entercom format known as \"Channel Q,\" a talk and EDM format, aimed at the LGBTQ community and heard in many radio markets served by Entercom FM stations.\n\n"}

The TFPC, a citizen body of thirty food activists, is responsible for generating food policy for the City of Toronto government.\n\nAs a leading member of the City of Toronto government's Environmental Task Force, Roberts helped develop a number of official plans for the city, including its Environmental Plan \"Clean, Green and Healthy: A Plan for an Environmentally Sustainable Toronto\" and \"Toronto's Food Charter.\" These were adopted by Toronto City Council in 2000 and 2001 respectively. His manual, based on Toronto's experiences, is called, \"Food for City Building: a Field Guide for Planners, Actionists and Entrepreneurs.\"\n\nRoberts included many ideas and projects of the TFPC in his book, \"The No-Nonsense Guide to World Food\" (2013).\n\nIn April 2009, under Roberts's leadership, the TFPC received the Bob Hunter Environmental Achievement Award for its efforts to make food an action item on the environmental agenda. The TFPC also won honorary mention for a major award from the Community Food Security Coalition that honors exceptional work to promote food sovereignty in October 2009.\n\nRoberts earned a Ph.D. in social and economic history from the University of Toronto in 1978.

The procedure is useful in the diagnosis and treatment of disorders such as kidney stones and urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract. Smaller stones in the bladder or lower ureter can be removed in one piece, while bigger ones are usually broken before removal during ureteroscopy.\n\nThe examination may be performed with either a flexible, semi-rigid or rigid device while the patient is under anesthesia. In specific cases, the patient is free to go home after the examination.\n\nIn pyeloscopy, the endoscope is designed to reach all the way to the renal pelvis (also called \"pyelum\"), thereby allowing visualisation of the entire drainage system of the kidney. The endoscope can contain an instrument port which allows for introduction of laser fibres to fragment stones, and micro-baskets to retrieve stone fragments.

{"id": "2295445", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2295445", "title": "Kathy Kirby", "text": "Kathy Kirby\n\nKathy Kirby (born Kathleen O'Rourke; 20 October 1938 – 19 May 2011) was an English singer, reportedly the highest-paid female singer of her generation. She is best known for her cover version of Doris Day's \"Secret Love\" and for representing the United Kingdom in the 1965 Eurovision Song Contest where she finished in second place. Her physical appearance often drew comparisons with Marilyn Monroe. Her popularity peaked in the 1960s, when she was one of the best-known and most-recognised personalities in British show business.\n\nKirby was born in Ilford, Essex, later part of Greater London, the eldest of three children of Irish parents. Her mother Eileen brought them up alone after their father left early in their childhood. Kirby grew up on Tomswood Hill, Barkingside, in Ilford, and attended the Ursuline Convent School in Ilford where she sang in the choir.\n\nKirby's vocal talent became apparent early in life, and she took singing lessons with a view to becoming an opera singer. She became a professional singer after meeting bandleader Bert Ambrose at the Ilford Palais in 1956. She remained with Ambrose's band for three years and he remained her manager, mentor and lover until his death on stage in Leeds in 1971.\n\nDuring the summer of 1957 Kirby performed at the Florida Park Restaurant in Madrid, and after returning to the UK not only performed with Ambrose's orchestra, but also with Nat Allen and his band. In 1959 Kirby joined vocalists Tony Mansell and Rikki Henderson in the Denny Boyce Band, and appeared regularly at the Lyceum Ballroom in London. In the summer of 1959 she made her solo cabaret debut at the Astor Club, and was subsequently signed to Pye Records in 1960 where she released two singles, \"Love Can Be\" and \"Now You're Crying\", which sold few copies but helped her get a six-month contract at Mayfair's Blue Angel nightclub. She adopted a \"blonde bombshell\" look and was compared to Marilyn Monroe.\n\nIn 1962 she signed a contract with Decca Records, for whom her first single was \"(He's a) Big Man\" in October 1962. The single sold well over a long period of time, but failed to reach the top of the British charts. It was however a hit in Vancouver's CFUN in January 1963. In the summer of 1963, after becoming a regular on the musical TV program \"Stars and Garters\", she had her first hit, \"Dance On!\", which peaked at No. 11 in the UK chart and No. 1 in Australia. Its follow-up was an upbeat reworking of the Doris Day classic \"Secret Love\" which peaked at No. 4 on the British chart and stayed there for about five months. In the same year she won Top British Female Singer in the \"New Musical Express\" poll. Her album \"16 Hits From Stars & Garters\" was released at the end of 1963, and cracked the top 20. The single \"Let Me Go, Lover!\", another upbeat reworking, this time of the classic by Joan Weber, reached No. 10 in early 1964. Kirby disliked the song, stating that: \"Honestly, I was really surprised because I never had much hope for this record, and when I recorded it I thought it might never get anywhere at all.\"\n\n\"Let Me Go, Lover!\" was followed by \"You're The One\", which peaked at No. 17 in May 1964. This success was followed by a record-breaking summer season show at the ABC Theatre in Blackpool.\n\nKirby became one of the biggest stars of the early to mid-1960s, appearing in the Royal Command Variety Performance and two television series for BBC TV. She represented the United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1965 and came second with the song \"I Belong\" which also became a hit. Author and historian John Kennedy O'Connor describes Kirby's \"I Belong\" as being far more representative of current musical tastes than other songs from the contest, but she was beaten by France Gall from Luxembourg, singing an even more contemporary song written by Serge Gainsbourg. An EP was issued featuring the six songs selected for the Eurovision Contest, featuring a different version of \"I Belong\", which peaked at No. 10 in 1965. An Italian version of \"I Belong\" was recorded by her under the title \"Tu Sei Con Me\". She also sang the theme tune of the BBC television series \"Adam Adamant Lives!\".\n\nIn September 1965 her single \"The Way of Love\" charted at No. 88 on the US Billboard Top 100. The song also charted in some of the regional charts, such as No. 35 in New York, No. 16 in Philadelphia, No. 39 in Detroit, No. 39 in Washington, and No. 38 in Los Angeles.\n\nAfter the chart success of \"I Belong\", Kirby recorded more than a dozen singles between 1965 and 1967, but they all failed to chart. She continued to make television appearances, and her 1974 appearance on \"The Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club\" TV variety show was for some time available to watch on YouTube but, , has been taken down due to a copyright claim by Network DVD (Sound & Media Ltd).\n\nDuring the 1970s, Kirby's singing career was eclipsed by a turbulent personal life, but she made occasional television appearances and performed a few live concerts on the \"nostalgia circuit\". On 31 December 1976, she performed her hit song \"Secret Love\" on BBC1's \"A Jubilee of Music\", celebrating British pop music for Queen Elizabeth II's impending Silver Jubilee.\n\nIn December 1983 she gave one last concert in Blackpool, then retired from show business altogether.\n\nShe did not perform in public after her retirement, but an amateur recording of Kirby singing the song \"He\", made in about 2005, is available online.\n\nInterest in Kirby and her work continued long after she stopped performing, particularly among gay men, for whom she was something of an icon. In her last decade, she recorded short greetings for her official website. A biography was published in 2005, and there was a 2008 stage show about her life, written and produced by Graham Smith, called \"Secret Love\". Smith re-wrote the show for the 2012 Haworth Festival, entitling it: \"Dance On: The Kathy Kirby Story\".\n\nThe \"Daily Express\" reported in 2008 that plans for a newly filmed interview had been abandoned, but later reports confirmed that the interview had been filmed, and it was subsequently included on a DVD compilation released the following year. She also gave an interview to the \"Express\" in 2009, which included recent photographs and was billed as her first in 26 years.\n\nFollowing the 2009 interview, the \"Sunday Express\" reported that some previously unreleased recordings would be made available on CD in 2010, and that Kirby had been approached to appear on \"Desert Island Discs\", although neither the programme nor the CD has been released.\n\nKirby met bandleader Bert Ambrose in her teens and, despite his being 42 years older and having an estranged wife at the time, began a relationship with him that lasted until his death in 1971. In the 2009 interview, she said she had had an affair with Bruce Forsyth during this time.\n\nKirby was married briefly to writer and former London policeman Frederick Pye in the 1970s. Following her bankruptcy in 1975 and a court case following an arrest over an unpaid hotel bill, she was referred to St Luke's psychiatric hospital in London in 1979. Following her discharge, she lived with a female fan, Laraine McKay, and said that they intended to marry. McKay was imprisoned for fraud and forgery. In the early 1980s Kirby had relationships with musician David Cross and lawyer Alan Porter.\n\nKirby was diagnosed with schizophrenia and was in poor physical and mental health for much of her life. After her retirement she lived in a series of apartments and hotels in west London, settling in an apartment in Emperor's Gate, South Kensington, surviving on state benefits and some royalties, and maintaining what has been called a \"Garbo-esque\" seclusion. Shortly before her death, Kirby moved to Brinsworth House in Twickenham at the insistence of her niece Sarah, Lady Thatcher, wife of Mark Thatcher.\n\nKirby died on 19 May 2011, a few days after moving to Brinsworth House. According to a message posted by a relative on a fan website, she suffered a heart attack. She was survived by her sister Pat and her brother Douglas.\n\nNote: Kirby had one charted single on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100. \"The Way of Love\" peaked at No. 88 in 1965; Cher also recorded the track.\n\n"}

{"id": "2295469", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2295469", "title": "Midlist", "text": "Midlist\n\nMidlist is a term in the publishing industry which refers to books which are not bestsellers but are strong enough to economically justify their publication (and likely, further purchases of future books from the same author). The vast majority of total titles published are midlist titles, though they represent a much smaller fraction of total book sales, which are dominated by bestsellers and other very popular titles.\n\nAuthors who consistently publish profitable but not bestselling books are referred to as Midlist authors.\n\nIn the US, midlist and backlist publications were negatively affected by the US Supreme Court decision in the 1979 case Thor Power Tool Company v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue. This decision reinterpreted rules for inventory depreciation, changing how book publishers had to account for unsold inventory each year, and their ability to depreciate it. Because stocks of unsold books could no longer be written down without proof of value, it became more efficient tax-wise for companies to simply destroy inventory. \n\nThe Thor decision caused publishers and booksellers to be much quicker to destroy stocks of poorly-selling books in order to realize a taxable loss. These books would previously have been kept in stock but written down to reflect the fact that not all of them were expected to sell. This has been somewhat mitigated by the development of online bookselling, which makes less popular titles more accessible to average readers. (For more on this phenomenon, see The Long Tail.)\n\nBecause this book is out of print, the publisher has an opening on its list, more cash to invest, and a serious need to replace the steady (if small) income stream that book would have generated. So the publisher must release not only the new title it would have published anyway, but a second new one, to make up for its lack of a backlist...\n\nThis results in title proliferation, which itself promotes both lower advance orders on the part of major buyers, and a higher return rate. That means writers must write more, and sell more often, in order to survive.\n"}

He starred for Yugoslavia at the 1990 FIFA World Cup (where he was named in the World Cup All-Star Team) and 1998 FIFA World Cup where he captained the team.\n\nHe is one of the five players to be awarded the title Star of the Red Star. He is widely considered to have never shown his true potential in Europe as injury prevented him from establishing himself at Marseille over the long term. Despite this, there is consensus among critics that he displayed an extraordinary ability throughout his career in spite of his chronic injuries, being most renowned in Japan.\n\nBorn to father Dobrivoje and mother Desanka in Niš, SR Serbia, SFR Yugoslavia, Stojković took to football very early while growing up in Pasi Poljana community near Niš. He has been nicknamed Piksi after \"Pixie\", one of the characters from the cartoon \"Pixie and Dixie and Mr. Jinks\".\n\nA midfielder and occasional forward, Stojković began his professional playing career with Yugoslav First League and hometown side Radnički Niš in 1981–82 when he made one first-team appearance. The next four seasons, Stojković appeared in 69 matches for Radnički and scored eight goals.\n\nIn the summer of 1986, twenty-one-year-old Stojković moved to Red Star Belgrade where he would spend the next four seasons, scoring 54 times in 120 appearances. \n\nIn the summer of 1990, twenty-five-year-old Stojković made the much publicized move to Olympique de Marseille for a transfer fee of £5.5 million, joining the star-laden squad bankrolled by French businessman/politician Bernard Tapie. The expectations were sky-high with a team featuring world-class players such as Jean-Pierre Papin, Éric Cantona, Chris Waddle, Carlos Mozer, Manuel Amoros, Didier Deschamps, Jean Tigana, Abédi Pelé, etc. as well as newly arrived defender Basile Boli and new head coach Franz Beckenbauer fresh off winning the 1990 FIFA World Cup with West Germany. Stojković had his own shining moments at the said World Cup, all of which only contributed to Marseille's interest.\n\nEarly into his debut season, Stojković sustained a knee injury for which he had to have surgery in Germany, forcing him to the sidelines for months. In fact, the entire 1990–91 league season was injury riddled for the Serb and he ended up making only eleven league appearances. Beckenbauer stepped down from the coaching post during the winter break, although he remained with the club in an adviser capacity. The new head coach to replace the famous German was Raymond Goethals. In the final of the UEFA European Champions' Cup, Marseille played against Stojković's former team Red Star. Stojković, a penalty kick specialist, entered the game late during the extra-time as a substitute, but as the match eventually went to a penalty shootout, he informed head coach Goethals that he did not want to take a penalty shot against his former team. Red Star won the European Cup in the shootout.\n\nHe subsequently transferred to Hellas Verona in Italy in the summer of 1991, for ten billion liras. The team had won the scudetto just six years before, but after some financial problems had just being promoted back to serie A after one year in the Italian second league. Stojkovic had an unlucky season, plagued by injuries and disciplinary troubles, and was sold back to Marseille where he remained for two more seasons.\n\nIn the spring of 1994 Stojković signed with Japanese J-League team Nagoya Grampus Eight, then managed by Arsène Wenger and featuring Gary Lineker. He spent seven seasons with Grampus Eight, retiring as a player in 2001. Stojković played 183 matches for the club, scoring 57 times. He was named J-League MVP for the 1995 season.\n\nStojković made his under-21 debut on 11 October 1983 versus Norway in Pančevo as part of qualifying for the 1984 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship. Playing under head coach Ivan Toplak, the youngster from Radnički Niš scored on his debut as Yugoslavia won 6–2.\n\nStojković made 84 career international appearances, scoring 15 times, those split between the SFR Yugoslavia national team and the FR Yugoslavia national team. He played for the former in UEFA Euro 1984, 1984 Summer Olympics, 1988 Summer Olympics and the 1990 FIFA World Cup and for the latter in the 1998 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2000. He made his international debut on 12 November 1983 in a scoreless draw against France.\n\nAt the 1990 World Cup, Stojković scored both goals in Yugoslavia's 2–1 round-of-16 defeat of Spain in Verona. In the quarter-final, he was one of three Yugoslavs to miss in the 3–2 penalty shootout defeat to world champions Argentina.\n\nHe was later called to UEFA Euro 1992, but the nation would be suspended due to the Yugoslav Wars. After being part of team in 1998 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2000, his final international match was against the country he spent much of his playing career in, Japan, on 4 July 2001.\n\nA highly skilful midfield playmaker, Stojković was also capable of playing as an attacking midfielder, as a central midfielder, or as a forward; he was known in particular for his vision, technique, creativity, dribbling skills, and passing ability. Despite his talent, his career was affected by several injuries, which hindered his potential.\n\nUpon retiring in 2001, 36-year-old Stojković immediately became the Yugoslav Football Association president, succeeding Miljan Miljanić. Though Stojković's appointment initially received wide public approval, his 4-year tenure will be remembered for 2006 world cup qualifier.\n\nDuring that period he was elected as a member of the UEFA technical committee and member of FIFA football committee for an 8-year term.\n\nIn July 2005, Stojković became the president of Red Star Belgrade. Similar to his FA appointment 4 years earlier, Stojković again became a successor to another long term, larger than life figure, Dragan Džajić who occupied various leading positions within the club's administration during the previous 26 years. This transfer of power was full of controversy with plenty of lobbying behind the scenes and at times open feuding in the press.\n\nOne of Stojković's first orders of business ahead of the 2005–06 season was firing the head coach he inherited, Ratko Dostanić, and bringing Walter Zenga who thus became the first foreigner ever to coach Red Star. Calling on his Japan connections, Stojković also got Toyota Motor Corporation to invest in the club through a shirt sponsorship deal. Additionally, he also opened the club's doors to various prominent Serbian companies like Delta Holding and Telekom Srbija thus creating a pool of sponsors.\n\nOn the player personnel front, Stojković initially more-or-less continued the existing \"buy low sell high\" policy that meant players were mostly recruited from Red Star's own youth system or smaller clubs throughout Serbia and Montenegro, and then sold abroad as soon as they gained some exposure on the European scene. Stojković's most prominent initial move was loaning out striker Marko Pantelić to Hertha Berlin for €250,000 on the last day of the summer 2005 transfer window (Pantelić was eventually sold to Hertha for additional €1.5 million in April 2006). On the other hand, 20-year-old striker Milan Purović and 22-year-old keeper Vladimir Stojković were brought to the club from Budućnost Podgorica and FK Zemun, respectively. Additionally, by bringing in Ghanaian midfielder Haminu Dramani, president Stojković indicated he was also interested in affordable foreign imports, which would soon become a staple of his transfer policy. All three new arrivals gelled well with the existing squad (featuring the likes of Nikola Žigić, Boško Janković, Milan Biševac, Dušan Basta, Nenad Kovačević, Aleksandar Luković, and Milan Dudić), as Red Star won the domestic double in impressive fashion. The club also played some impressive football in UEFA Cup where on last group matchday only a late goal by RC Strasbourg's Kevin Gameiro prevented them from progressing to the eight-finals.\n\nWinning the double combined with some fine European outings during previous season raised the fans' expectations considerably as they now wanted the existing Red Star squad to be kept intact (especially Nikola Žigić who reportedly at the time became a target of some high-profile English Premiership clubs) in order to make a serious run at qualifying for the UEFA Champions League. However, the first move came as a complete shock – president Stojković sold goalkeeper Vladimir Stojković to FC Nantes, reportedly for €3 million. Trying to deal with the angry fan reaction, he attempted to explain that the move had been necessary to cover the club debt that grew to alarming levels following years of mismanagement and unpaid commitments of some key sponsor pool members. The wholesale continued with Nenad Kovačević, Milan Dudić, Haminu Dramani, Aleksandar Luković, and Boško Janković also leaving, but their departures caused comparatively less angry fan reaction. However most were still disappointed to see the winning team disassembled and sold off so quickly.\n\nOn 12 October 2007 Stojković announced that he was stepping down as the president of Red Star Belgrade.\n\nStojković returned to Japan to take over as manager of his former club, Nagoya Grampus, on 22 January 2008. On 15 March 2008 the former J.League MVP won his first game as manager as Nagoya Grampus stunned AFC Champions League 2007 Champions Urawa Reds 2–0 at Urawa's home, the Saitama Stadium. Despite his glorious playing career at Nagoya, some Nagoya fans were initially worried about his lack of experience as a coach; however, his team finished in 3rd place and he led the club to AFC Champions League for the first time in his debut season.\n\nIn a 2009 J.League match between Yokohama F. Marinos and Nagoya Grampus, Stojković amazed everyone by scoring a goal from his technical area. One of the players had just been injured, so the goalkeeper Tetsuya Enomoto kicked the ball out of play to stop the game. Stojković got out of his seat in the dugout and volleyed the ball, which went high into the air before dipping into goal. For this action he was sent off by the referee.\n\nOn 20 November 2010, Stojković led Grampus to the J. League title, the club's very first. Stojković has stated that he had learnt a lot about football from former manager Arsène Wenger, who had led the club to their previous best showing in 1995 when they finished runners-up and Emperor's Cup champions, and had kept regular contact with him, with Wenger giving him advice and congratulating him on the club's success. Stojković has been named by Wenger as the person he would like to take over Arsenal when he has gone stating \"Our ideas are the same and we both strive for perfect football.\" After the successful 2010 season, Stojković was awarded the J. League Manager of the Year.\n\nStojković was announced as manager of Chinese Super League side Guangzhou R&F on 24 August 2015 on a contract that would expire in 2017. On 8 September 2016, Guangzhou R&F confirmed that Stojković had signed a renewed contract with Guangzhou R&F until the end of the 2020. Stojković saved the team from the threat of relegation in 2015. The rest of his time in charge was characterised by attacking football, with striker Eran Zahavi twice winning the CSL golden boot award. Guangzhou R&F also made the semi-finals of the CFA Cup in 2016 and 2018, and just missed out on qualifying for the Asian Champions League in 2017. The team finished 12th in the 2019 Super League and had the league's worst defensive record, conceding 72 goals in 30 games. After spending over four seasons at the club - making him Guangzhou R&F's longest ever serving manager - Stojkovic left the club in January 2020. \n\nRed Star Belgrade \n\nMarseille \nNagoya Grampus Eight \n\nYugoslavia \n\nIndividual\n\nNagoya Grampus Eight\n\nIndividual\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2295497", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2295497", "title": "Aboyne dress", "text": "Aboyne dress\n\nThe aboyne dress is the name given to the prescribed attire for female dancers in the Scottish national dances, such as the Flora MacDonald's fancy, the Scottish lilt, and others. Male dancers wear the kilt for these dances, the kilt being a male garment. There are two versions of the aboyne dress in use. Some consider the aboyne as quite suited to the graceful movements of the National dances.\n\nThe Aboyne Highland Games, established in 1867, have stipulated this style of attire for female dancers since 1952 for both national and highland dances.\n\nA typical Aboyne dress consists of a dark bodice or elaborate waistcoat, decorative blouse, full tartan skirt and some times a petticoat and apron. Some have a tartan sash (usually draped over the shoulder and coming down towards the hem of the skirt in the back) rather than an apron. While appearing to be simple and plain (and poorly assembled), a properly made, modern Aboyne dress might and can be quite expensive.\n\nIn one version, a tartan pattern skirt is worn with an over-the-shoulder plaid, a white blouse and petticoat, and a velvet bodice. The alternative is a white dress over a petticoat, together with a tartan pattern sash.\n\nThe name derives from the Aboyne Highland Games in Scotland where, in the early 1950s the dance committee under games patron Lieutenant Colonel John Wilmot Nicol DSO of Ballogie, dissatisfied with the state of affairs of female Highland dance attire, prescribed new rules governing acceptable and better-looking attire for the female dancers. The problem, as they saw it, was that many felt that the female and male dancers should not be wearing the same outfits and that a separate style for women should be developed.\n\nAbout 1949, the committee banned female dancers from wearing the kilt, sporran or medals. By 1952, they introduced an alternative attire of white blouse, tartan skirt and long black stockings, then for the September 1954 games, a new attire was introduced for all female dancers (previously it did not apply to girls between six and eleven). Approved by the Lord Lyon King of Arms, it was a skirt of light-weight tartan worn over a white petticoat, with a plaid of the same tartan material and a tight fitting sleeveless velvet corsage (the upper part of a woman's dress) over a white blouse. It was designed from the traditional Scottish woman's dress that was banned after the introduction of the \"Act of Proscription 1746\" (England).\n\nThe men would continue to dance in traditionally male kilt and jacket, wearing bonnets and sporrans.\n\nThe original decision of the Aboyne committee applied to both the Highland dances and the National dances. The Scottish Official Board of Highland Dancing a few years later modified the dress code so the aboyne dress would be used by women for just the national dances, and a kilt-based outfit (without bonnet or sporran) for the Highland dances. To this day, however, at the Aboyne Highland Games the wearing of the aboyne by women is strongly 'preferred', except for the Sailor's hornpipe and Irish jig.\n\n\n"}

A small but dedicated community of dice shooters claim proof of dice influencing in casino conditions. The concept of such precision shooting claims to elevate craps from a random game of chance to a sport, like bowling, darts, or pool. Many within the advantage gambling community still doubt if dice control can overcome the house advantage on craps.\n\nThe concept of \"controlled shooting\" goes beyond simply \"setting the dice\" prior to shooting. It purports to involve limiting the rotational characteristics of the dice. The theory is that if the dice are properly gripped and tossed at the correct angle they will land just before the back wall of the craps table, then gently touch the wall, greatly increasing the probability of their remaining on the same axis. If executed properly and consistently this technique would be able to change the game's long-term odds from the house's favor to the player's favor.\n\nChris Pawlicki (author of \"Get The Edge At Craps: How to Control the Dice\") explains the math and science behind dice control. Stanford Wong, well-known advantage player and gaming author, also discusses dice control in his book \"Wong on Dice\". Pawlicki and Jerry L. Patterson co-developed PARR (Patterson Rhythm Roll) in 1997, which claims to be the first course on how to set and control dice.\n\nJim Klimesh, director of casino operations for Indiana's Empress Casino Hammond believes it is sometimes possible to control the dice with certain throws that do not hit the back wall of the craps table. One example is the \"army blanket roll\", named after the playing surface of the dice games of American servicemen during World War II. In the army blanket roll, a player sets the dice on an axis and gently rolls or slides them down the table. If the shooter is successful, the dice will not leave the axis they are rolled on and will come to rest before hitting the back wall. A successful shooter would affect the odds significantly.\n\nBut most casinos require that the dice touch the wall in order for a throw to be valid. The chances of altering the odds when the dice bounce off a surface of rubber pyramids are much slimmer, no matter what axis the dice were on before they hit. Dice control proponents advocate a throw that gently bounces off of the back wall and comes to rest after barely touching it. Experiments have been conducted on the subject of dice control, with inconclusive results.\n"}

{"id": "2295522", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2295522", "title": "New York City landmark bomb plot", "text": "New York City landmark bomb plot\n\nThe New York City landmark bomb plot was a plan to follow up the February 1993 World Trade Center bombing and was designed to inflict mass casualties on American soil by attacking well-known landmark targets throughout New York City, United States. If the attack had been successful, thousands likely would have died.\n\nAfter the World Trade Center bombing, the Federal Bureau of Investigation had a confidential informant, Emad Salem, infiltrate the group of plotters. FBI officers arrested the main suspects in June 1993 before the plot could be carried out. In 1995, ten defendants were convicted of 48 charges related to the plot.\n\nThe plot was espoused by a blind sheikh, Omar Abdel-Rahman, who was a radical Muslim cleric in New York City, to be carried out by some of his followers. Rahman was the spiritual leader of the al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, a radical Egyptian Islamic group that had links to al-Qaeda. One of Rahman's followers, El Sayyid Nosair, had assassinated Meir Kahane in 1990 and was linked to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.\n\nThe six targets to be attacked were the UN headquarters, the Lincoln Tunnel, the Holland Tunnel, the George Washington Bridge, the St. Regis and the UN Plaza Hotels, and the FBI's main New York office at the Jacob K. Javits Federal Building. There was also some talk of bombing Jewish targets in the city They also wanted to assassinate US Senator Al D'Amato and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.\n\nNosair also wanted to assassinate New York State Assemblyman Dov Hikind, a Jewish politician, and Alvin Schlesinger, a judge who had tried him in a previous case.\n\nThe attack on the hotels would be detrimental because they are known to host prestigious guests such as the US ambassador to the United Nations and the US secretary of state, who stayed at the Waldorf during UN sessions. The hotels are also known to host several prominent business leaders. Attacking the locations would thus create chaos in the financial and diplomatic aspects of New York.\n\nThe planned attacks on the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels and the George Washington Bridge would create chaos in transportation between New Jersey and Manhattan, as these were the only three direct vehicular crossings between the two locations. If the attacks were successful, police, civilians, and other respondents would have major issues entering and leaving the city. Co-conspirators indicated that they intended to drive bomb-laden cars into the tunnels, stall the cars in the middle, and detonate them three minutes after leaving the cars.\n\nThe attackers also discussed attacks on the Diamond District in Manhattan, an area populated by a large population of Jewish businessmen. It was stated that attacking the neighborhood would be similar to \"hitting Israel itself.\" Simultaneous attacks in the same city were carried out as well during the 2008 Mumbai attacks.\n\nThe New York group had supposedly wanted to plant a total of 12 bombs around the city targeting Jews and then detonate them at the same time.\n\nThe terrorists suspected President Mubarak to be present in the hotels and intended to infiltrate the hotels by using disguises as employees to get close to him. The other attacks in the city were used as distractions and to inflict chaos throughout the city. Bombs would be used on the bridges while the other terrorists would raid the hotels with guns. Even if it was not there, the attacks throughout the city would have caused a large number of deaths.\n\nThe FBI had been closely monitoring the plan throughout 1992 and 1993 but intensified its investigation after the World Trade Center bombing in February 1993, which killed six people.\n\nEmad Salem was used as an intelligence asset during the entire investigation (codenamed TERRSTOP) into the plot and for one year earlier. He had experienced a man being tortured when he was young and so Salem wanted revenge on radical Islam. FBI agents first used him to find the illegal selling of weapons and green cards from Russians and then Salem agreed to help the FBI during the plot. He was recruited to get information of the terrorists the details of the plan. Salem agreed to spy for the FBI if his identity was never revealed. The FBI insisted that he should wear a recording device so that he could testify in later trials, but he did not agree to that. The FBI then used him only as an \"intelligence asset.\" Around May 7, 1993, Salem started meeting regularly with the defendants.\n\nThe FBI had also been monitoring the terrorists through video surveillance hidden in the terrorists' safe house, where bombs had been being developed. Combined, the video surveillance and the use of an inside man greatly contributed into foiling the plot. In the final weeks of the investigation, the FBI monitored the plot almost constantly. At one point, when Senator D'Amato and Assemblyman Hikind received bodyguards, agents mistakenly feared that their investigation had been exposed.\n\nSalem infiltrated the group and gathered information that led to the arrest of the plotters. The FBI took two years to investigate the plot, which showed that a slow approach to terrorist investigations was beneficial. James Kallstrom, an ex-FBI officer, said, \"You obviously want to play things out so you can fully identify the breadth and scope of the conspiracy. Obviously, the most efficient and effective way to do that is to bring it down to the last stage.\" That was the precedent for many later terrorist cases. The general public later criticized that strategy, but the FBI still leans toward slow approaches to foil terrorist plots.\n\nEight conspirators were arrested in a raid on June 24, 1993, after Salem had observed the group for five months. The conspirators were mixing chemicals for the bombs when they were being arrested. It was revealed that the conspirators had also conducted test bombings before the World Trade Center bombing. They had also made preparations to escape quickly, which led the FBI to conclude that the suspects needed to be arrested quickly. A ninth suspect was arrested on June 30. The government announced the indictment of a tenth suspect on July 8. After the arrests were made, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey increased security on its six river crossings between New York and New Jersey. The three crossings in the bombing plot had been under the Port Authority's purview.\n\nWilliam Kunstler agreed to represent three of the suspects, including Rahman and Nosair. However, Federal Judge Michael Mukasey later ruled that Rahman and the two other suspects would have to be represented separately and that Kunstler and Ronald L. Kuby would have to choose which defendants to represent. Rahman later offered to represent himself after the two lawyers could not agree on who would represent him. A bail hearing for one of the suspects, Clement Rodney Hampton-El, was held at the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on July 8. The court found that Salem's tapes supported only some of charges against Hampton-El. The federal government wanted to try the suspects in New York because of the severity of the charges. Complicating matters, some of the suspects were also being arraigned on drug charges. A week and a half later, the US government announced that found evidence that Sudan had been giving help to Rahman and the other plotters. Sudanese diplomats had assisted the planned attack on the United Nations headquarters. Consequently, the US government placed Sudan on a watch list of terrorist countries.\n\nOn August 25, 1993, Attorney General Janet Reno announced that she would prosecute the bombing case because of more evidence. That was a reversal from her position two months earlier, when she had said that there was insufficient evidence for prosecution. The same day, Rahman was formally indicted in connection with three crimes: the landmark bombing plot, the World Trade Center bombing, and the 1990 assassination of Meir Kahane. The case against the defendants was prosecuted by lead prosecutor Andrew C. McCarthy. One of the defendants, Siddig Ibrahim Siddig Ali, allowed prosecutors to view his notes.\n\nSalem ultimately testified against Rahman and other terrorists despite earlier refusing to do so. Salem had recorded tapes in which the defendants sought to prevent Rahman from being directly involved in the terror plot so that he would not be implicated. The defense lawyers unsuccessfully attempted to have all 13 defendants tried separately. New defense counsel were hired, and in September 1994, Judge Mukasey postponed the trial's opening date to December so that defense counsel could come up with new arguments. In November 1994, Mukasey rescheduled the date to January 1995 because Rahman had contracted pneumonia.\n\nIn February 1995, Rahman pleaded guilty to the terror plot and also named some of the co-defendants as complicit in the plot.\n\nOnce the trial started, Salem testified about the details of the bomb plot. Defense lawyers cross-examining Salem argued that he was not credible because he had lied several times in the past, including when he was gaining his US citizenship. However, Salem testified that the defendants had confided the details of the plot to him. In May 1995, one of the defendants, Abdo Mohammed Haggag, agreed to testify against the other 11 defendants in exchange for all his charges being dropped.\n\nOn October 1, 1995, Rahman and nine others were convicted by a New York jury on 48 of 50 charges, including seditious conspiracy, solicitation to murder Mubarak, conspiracy to murder Mubarak, solicitation to attack a US military installation, and conspiracy to conduct bombings. In January 1996, Mukasey sentenced Rahman and nine other defendants to terms that ranged from 25 years to life in prison. After the trial, Salem received a large sum of money and was put onto a witness protection program.\n\n"}

It is free and published daily during the Syracuse University academic year.\n\nIt was one of the first college papers to become fully independent from its parent college. Its alumni work at nearly every major newspaper in the nation — \"The New York Times\", \"Los Angeles Times\", \"The Washington Post\", \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\", \"The Dallas Morning News\", \"The Boston Globe —\" in a variety of reporting, editing, design and photography roles.\n\nPublisher reported circulation for 2018 was 6,000 copies, with a weekly online circulation of about 45,000. The paper's print edition is published Monday, Wednesday and Thursday during the academic year, but content is published online daily during the academic year. The Tuesday print edition was dropped starting in fall 2018 to focus on digital content.\n\nA major turning point in D.O. history occurred in 1971. Until that time, the newspaper was considered part of SU, meaning that the administration could possibly influence the content of the paper based on financial holds. In 1971, the university refused to back The D.O. in a libel suit and the editorial staff decided to sever the ties that existed with the administration. The paper became a student organization that received funding for production costs from the Student Government Association (now known as the Student Association).\n\nThe D.O. continued to operate this way, receiving funds from the annual student activity fee, until 1991. A referendum vote determined whether the student body would continue to contribute a portion of its fee. In 1991, however, Editor in Chief Jodi Lamagna and her staff decided to refuse any further funding from SGA. In the process, The D.O. became one of the few completely independent student newspapers in the country.\n\nSince then, The D.O. has operated with complete financial independence from the university, raising funds necessary for publishing a daily paper through advertising revenue and fundraising. Though it still maintains a business relationship with the university, in regards to its status as a student group and its housing agreement, its relationship with administrators has no bearing on its editorial content.\n\nIn the early 1980s, The Daily Orange was a plaintiff in a lawsuit against the CIA.\n\nThe D.O. was the first student newspaper to have comics. The paper has produced many famous cartoonists, such as Vaughn Bode, Robb Armstrong (creator of \"Jump Start\"), Brad Anderson (creator of \"Marmaduke\"), Steve Ellis and Nicholas Gurewitch (creator of the \"Perry Bible Fellowship\").\n\nThe paper has in the past decade won numerous awards, including more than a dozen \"story of the year\" awards in several categories from the Associated Collegiate Press and top-story honors from the William Randolph Hearst Foundation. It is also the best-designed student newspaper in the country, as voted at the University of Missouri Student Society for News Design awards in 2005.\n\nThe Daily Orange was named the best all-around student newspaper in the country by the Society of Professional Journalists in 2018.\n\n\n"}

He also purchased Bedminster, Hareclive and Billeswick manors. He went on to found the Abbey of St Augustine at what was Billeswick, and bequeathed the income from the parish to support the abbey. Because of this connection to the abbey, when the Diocese of Bristol was carved out of the Bath and Wells, Gloucester and Worcester diocesan territories (Patent Roll, Henry VIII, Art. 9, June 1542) the new diocese's boundary was drawn to include the parish, including the Saxon enclosure at Hamgreen which had been part of Portbury manor lands until then. All the surrounding parishes in Somerset are in Bath and Wells diocese. The parish map shows this meandering historic boundary which puts St Katherine's School and Chapel Pill Farm both within the parish.\n\nThe parish of Abbots Leigh was part of the Portbury Hundred.\n\nThe manor house here, also named Abbot's Leigh or Leigh Court, was a resting place of Charles II during his escape to France in 1651. He arrived on the evening of 12 September, and stayed at the home of Mr and Mrs George Norton, who were friends of the King's travelling companion, Jane Lane. The Nortons were unaware of the King's identity during his three-day stay.\n\nA description of the house appears in the book \"The Escape of Charles II, After the Battle of Worcester\" by Richard Ollard:\n\n\"Abbots Leigh was the most magnificent of all the houses in which Charles was sheltered during his escape. A drawing made in 1788, only twenty years before it was pulled down, shows a main front of twelve gables, surmounting three storeys of cowled windows; a comfortable, solid west country Elizabethan house.\"\n\nWhile staying at Abbots Leigh, Charles deflected suspicion by asking a trooper, who had been in the King's personal guard, to describe the King's appearance and clothing at the Battle of Worcester. The man looked at Charles and said, \"The King was at least three inches taller than you.\"\n\nThe King's escape route is commemorated in the Monarch's Way long distance footpath which passes through the village.\n\nIn 1942, during World War II, Rev. Cyril Vincent Taylor (1907–1991), then a producer of Religious Broadcasting at the BBC and stationed in the village, wrote a hymn tune which he named after it. The tune was originally written for the hymn \"Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken\". This hymn had usually been sung to the tune \"Austrian Hymn\", or \"Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser\", but since the German national anthem was also sung to that tune, new music was needed in wartime Britain. Other hymn texts now commonly sung to the same tune include \"Father Lord of All Creation\", \"God is Here\", \"Go My Children, With my Blessing\" and \"Lord, You Give the Great Commission\".\n\nThe parish is in the unitary authority of North Somerset which was created in 1996, under the Local Government Act 1992. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area, including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. It is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, Trading Standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the South Western Ambulance Service.\n\nNorth Somerset's area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters is in the town hall in Weston-super-Mare. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Woodspring district of the county of Avon. Before 1974 that the parish was part of the Long Ashton Rural District.\n\nThe parish is represented in the House of Commons as part of the North Somerset county constituency, which elects one MP, currently Liam Fox of the Conservative Party.\n\nThe Church of England parish church of the Holy Trinity is a 15th-century Perpendicular Gothic building, restored and partially rebuilt in 1847–48 after a fire. The tower has six bells, three of which were cast in 1781 by William Bilbie of the Bilbie family. English Heritage has designated Holy Trinity a Grade II* listed building.\n\n"}

The Amphitheatre is owned by the city of Los Angeles and is operated by ASM Global. Designed by architects Samuel Tilden Norton, Frederick Hastings Wallisand, and the Tacoma firm Heath, Gove, & Bell, the theatre stage is modeled after a Greek temple.\n\nThe idea for the Greek Theatre originated with wealthy landowner Griffith J. Griffith, who donated of land to the city of Los Angeles in 1896 to create Griffith Park. In his will he left money for the construction of a Greek theatre. A canyon site was chosen because of its good acoustics. The cornerstone was laid in 1928 and the building was officially dedicated on September 25, 1930. The first performance took place on June 26, 1931, attended by a capacity crowd of 4,000.\n\nDuring its first decades the theatre was rarely used, and it was used as a barracks during World War II. In the late 1940s a San Francisco producer brought touring shows to the venue. In the 1950s James Doolittle, a Los Angeles showman, leased the theatre and upgraded it with better seating and backstage equipment. Between 1975 and 2015, the theatre was managed by the Nederlander Organization, which further improved it and began a regular rotation of contemporary and classical productions and concerts. The theatre underwent an earthquake retrofit in 1995. In 2006 the facade was renovated in celebration of the venue's 75th anniversary. In 2015, Live Nation attempted to replace Nederlander in operating the theatre, leading to a joint venture with Live Nation and Nederlander, along with Goldenvoice, programming shows while SMG managed the venue.\n\nIn 1983, the Greek Theatre's seating capacity was expanded to 6,187, but renovations brought the Greek Theatre's capacity down to 6,162 in 1995 and to 5,700 in 2004. In 2009 the Los Angeles Fire Marshal permitted the addition of two more rows in the pit, bringing full capacity at the Greek to 5,870 seated and 5,900 general admission.\n\nThe Greek Theatre is used for concerts, stage shows, and graduation ceremonies for Thomas Starr King Middle School and John Marshall High School, among others.\n\nThe Greek Theatre won the Best Small Outdoor Venue award seven times in the past eight years, awarded by Pollstar Magazine, the industry's leading trade publication.\n\nThe annual Bell-Jeff Invitational cross country running event starts adjacent to the theater.\n\n"}

The Yalta Conference was held there in 1945, when the palace housed the apartments of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and other members of the American delegation – the Russian delegation was housed in the Yusupov Palace, and the British in the Vorontsov Palace some five miles distant. Today the palace houses a museum, but it is sometimes used for international summits.\n\nFormerly granted to Lambros Katsonis and later a possession of the Potocki family, the Livadia estate became a summer residence of the Russian imperial family in the 1860s, when architect Ippolito Monighetti built a large palace, a small palace, and a church there. The residence was frequented by Alexander II of Russia, while his successor Alexander III used to live (and died) in the smaller palace. His son Nicholas II decided to have the larger palace demolished and replaced with a larger structure. (The smaller palace was preserved, as the place of his father's death, but was later destroyed during World War II.)\n\nAround 1909, Nikolay Krasnov, Yalta's most fashionable architect, responsible for the grand ducal residences in Koreiz, was engaged to prepare plans for a new imperial palace. The Tsar's diary indicates that the design was much discussed in the Imperial Family; it was decided that all four façades of the palace should look different. After 17 months of construction, the new palace was inaugurated on 11 September 1911. In November Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna celebrated her 16th birthday at Livadia.\n\nAfter the February Revolution in 1917, Nicholas's mother, Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna, fled to Livadia with some other members of the Imperial family. They were eventually rescued by the British ship HMS Marlborough, sent by the Dowager Empress's nephew, King George V.\n\nDuring the Second World War, a ceremony marking the successful completion of the German Crimean Campaign (1941–1942), with the capture of Sevastopol by the German 11th Army under the command of General Erich von Manstein, and Manstein's promotion to the rank of \"Generalfeldmarschall\" (field marshal), was held in the garden of Livadia Palace on July 6, 1942. Participants included officers, non-commissioned officers and soldiers who were awarded the German \"Ritterkreuz\" (Knight's Cross) and the \"Deutsches Kreuz in Gold\" (German Cross in Gold).\n\nThe palace was once used as a mental institution, and is now a historical museum. Most of the historical furnishings have been lost, but anything that has been recovered can be seen for a small fee. In August 2007 the palace was recognized as a \"landmark of modern history\" by the Seven Wonders of Ukraine project. Ukrainian pop singer Sofia Rotaru, who celebrated her 60th birthday at the palace in the company of the presidents of Russia, Ukraine, and Moldova – the second such meeting since the Yalta Conference – funded the restoration of Livadia Palace in 2008.\n\nNumerous academic conferences have been held at the palace. Palace staff actively publish their research. Visitors are particularly interested in the events of 1945.\n\nOn 18 November 2017, the 123rd anniversary of Tsar Alexander III's burial, Russian president Vladimir Putin dedicated a monument to Alexander III on the grounds of the Levadia Palace. Putin said in part, \"Alexander III loved Russia and believed in it, and, opening this monument today, we pay tribute to his deeds, achievements and merits, express our respect for the indissoluble history of our country, for people of all ranks and classes who honestly served the Fatherland.\"\n\nThe Livadia Palace is built of white Crimean limestone in the Neo-Renaissance style. The edifice features an arched portico of Carrara marble, a spacious Arabic patio, an Italian patio, a Florentine tower, ornate Bramantesque windows, a \"balcony-belvedere\", and multiple bays with jasper vases. A gallery connects the palace with a neo-Byzantine church of the Exaltation of the Cross, built by Monighetti in 1866.\n\nThe palace contains 116 rooms, with interiors furnished in different styles. There are a Pompeian vestibule, an English billiard-room, a Neo-baroque dining room, and a Jacob-style study of maple wood, which elicited particular admiration of Nicholas II.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2295585", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2295585", "title": "Service Civil International", "text": "Service Civil International\n\nService Civil International (SCI) is an international non-governmental voluntary service organisation and peace movement with 43 branches and groups worldwide. The organisation was founded in 1920 by Swiss engineer Pierre Cérésole. It is also known as International Voluntary Service in a number of English-speaking countries and as Voluntary Service International in Ireland.\n\nSCI states to base its work on the following values: \nSCI believes that all people are capable of living together with mutual respect and without recourse to any form of violence to solve conflicts. It organises international volunteer projects all over the world because it believes that peace can only be built if people with different backgrounds and cultures learn to co-operate and work together.\n\nSCI was born out of a passionate search for peace, immediately after World War I. Taking part in the first International Conference of the Fellowship of Reconciliation in 1920 in Bilthoven, Pierre Cérésole, a Swiss radical pacifist initiated a peace project with volunteers from different countries in France.\n\nThe first international \"workcamp\" took place on the former battle field of Verdun (France) in 1920 in order to reconstruct the war-damaged village Esnes-en-Argonne and being a symbol of reconciliation between France and Germany. Among the small group of international volunteers were also three German volunteers. They built temporary homes for the villagers and cleared the farm land.\n\nIn 1924, Cérésole organised a second international workcamp in Les Ormonts (Switzerland), which helped to clear rubble after an avalanche. This service was promoted as a model service for conscientious objectors, in order to support a political campaign to introduce an alternative service. In the following years more relief services were organized. The largest has been in 1928 in Liechtenstein with more than 700 volunteers from 28 countries, which cleared the Rhine valley plain after a heavy flood in 1927.\n\nIn the first decade of SCI, workcamps were used relief services for regions affected by natural disasters. In 1931, the SCI \"idea\" evolved and the concept of Workcamps with international volunteers were applied in other areas of social commitment: \n\nSince 1920, SCI organised workcamps and activities with no formal structure in France, Switzerland, Great Britain, India, and other countries. As the idea workcamps expanded to other countries after World War II an international association of SCI branches with an international secretariat in Paris was founded. The volunteer exchange and workcamp organisation were improved (such as set up volunteer insurance). The number of workcamps and volunteers increased tremendously:\nThe number branches increased similar. In the 60s regional coordination structures for Africa, Asia and Europa were set up.\n\nIn 1950, SCI was invited by the recent independent India in order to carry out construction of houses for refugees in Faridabad (India) and. A small group of international volunteer was able to recruit many local volunteers. The conflict between India and Pakistan inspired them to organise workcamps in Pakistan since 1951. As consequence, several local branches and groups of SCI were founded in Asia.\n\nConfronted by the immense poverty in disadvantaged regions in Europe, Asia and Africa, SCI started to set up development aid program and recruiting qualified volunteers. The largest development programme was in the province of Tlemcen, West Algeria, after the Algerian War Independence (1954-1962). Simone Tanner Chaumet worked in Algeria as an SCI volunteer. From 1962 till 1968 SCI rebuilt the village Beni Hamou, set up a medical service and community development like primary teaching for the district of Sebdou.\n\nDespite the Cold War SCI looked for an exchange Eastern bloc. As non-communist organisation, SCI volunteers took part in a workcamp during 5th World Youth Festival in Warsaw (Poland) in 1955. From then on workcamps were co-organised with socialist volunteer organisation in Poland (1955), GDR (1956), USSR (1958), Hungary (1964), Czechoslovakia (1964), and Bulgaria (1981). This contacts were intensified in the 70s. 1972 SCI set up East West commission in order to facilitate volunteer exchange and to improve co-operation with partner organisations in socialist countries.\nWith the political shift in Eastern Europe new SCI initiatives started since 1990.\n\nIn a row of seminars, workshops and meetings from 1969 on, the political implication of SCI in society were reviewed. As consequence SCI abandon the developmental aid approach as one of the main purpose of workcamps. The social and political awareness rising for and through international volunteers got focus in most activities of SCI. In particular the North-South reorientate to the concept of development education and solidarity. Examples several international campaigns (1985-1992) for the independence of Namibia were organised, which was followed by an international refugee campaign (1994-1997).\n\nThe reorientation lead to further standardisation in international volunteer exchange. In the late 1970s, a decentralised volunteer placement system for workcamps was introduced, while the North-South and East-West exchange were centralised by European and International Co-ordination of SCI. The latter was decentralised in the mid 90s.\n\nWith the reorientation in the 1970s, SCI converted its structure with international and regional secretariats to and international coordination with working groups with focus on a particular region or interest area. In 1997 major constitutional change introduced a status for working groups, which are approved now every year. Regional working groups exists for Africa, Asia and Latin America (Aba Yala) and South Eastern Europe (SAVA). The other working groups focused on the following topics:\n\nSCI divides between full member with \"branches\"-status and associated members with \"group\"-status. The international committee of SCI decides about the status based on the national constitution, organisation and infrastructure of its members. The national branches can have their own names, which they state \"branch of SCI\" in their documents. The following tables gives an overview on all branches and groups of SCI. The beginning of activities often refers to the first workcamp organised by or in co-operation with SCI.\n\nThe organisation has consultative status with the Council of Europe, operational relations with UNESCO and is a member of: \n\nIn 1987, SCI was awarded the title of Messenger of Peace given by the United Nations, in acknowledgement of its efforts to promote peace and understanding.\n\nFull members status is held to the European Youth Forum (YFJ) which operates within the Council of Europe and European Union areas and works closely with both these bodies.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2295607", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2295607", "title": "Miguel de Molinos", "text": "Miguel de Molinos\n\nMiguel de Molinos (29 June 1628 – 29 December 1696) was a Spanish mystic, the chief representative of the religious revival known as Quietism.\n\nHe was born in 1628 near Muniesa (Teruel), in Aragon, a village around 60 miles south of Zaragoza. His birthdate is unknown, but church records indicate he was baptised on 29 June 1628. He moved to Valencia in his youth and undertook religious education with the Jesuits there at the College of St Paul. He was ordained in 1652, and seemingly took his doctorate shortly thereafter, though it is unclear when or where (both the University of Valencia and the College of St Paul granted doctorates). On 4 June 1662, Molinos was admitted to the local chapter of the School of Christ, a religious brotherhood that would play an important role in his later life in Rome. He seems in these early years in Valencia to have held a number of secondary roles in the chapter’s leadership, at least one of which earned him a place on the chapter’s governing body.\n\nIn July 1663, Molinos was chosen to travel to Rome to support the cause of the beatification of, and to report back to Valencia on, the Venerable Francisco Jerónimo Simón (d. 1612), a secular cleric and beneficer of the parish of St Andrews in Valencia. He left Spain in late 1663; he would not return.\n\nThere is almost no specific evidence of Molinos's activities in Rome in 1663–1675. It is known that Molinos was affiliated with the Roman chapter of the School of Christ (and, by 1671 at the latest, had become its leader). He also became well known as a spiritual director – and it was in this role that he gained prominence as the leading advocate of the teaching and practice that would come to be known as Quietism. He was a regular correspondent with Princess Borghese, and counted as an admirer, Cardinal Benedetto Odescalchi, who in 1676 became Pope Innocent XI. He also paid frequent visits to the house of the exiled Christina, Queen of Sweden. He was also in these years working on the case of the Venerable Simón; by 1675, however, Molinos had to admit to his superiors in Valencia that the Congregation of Rites had refused to reconsider the case. Molinos’s royal commission and line of credit were revoked, and he was deprived of his official position in the Valencian delegation in Rome.\n\nIn the same year, 1675, Molinos published his most famous work, the \"Spiritual Guide\". The initial Spanish edition was quickly followed by an Italian translation entitled \"Guida spirituale, che disinvolge l'anima e la conduce per l'interior camino all' acquisito della perfetta contemplazione e del ricco tesoro della pace interiore\" (Spiritual Guide, which releases the soul and conducts it through the interior path to acquire the perfect contemplation and rich treasure of interior peace). The work was published with the usual approval from the ecclesiastical authorities – the book received the imprimatur from the Dominican Raimondo Capizucchi, the pope’s own theologian, and the book opened with approbations by clergy of the Trinitarian, Franciscan, Carmelite, Capuchin and Jesuit orders. This was followed soon after in 1675 by a brief \"Trattato della cotidiana communione\" (\"Brief Treatise on Daily Communion\"), in which Molinos argued that those who wished to receive the Eucharist daily should not be denied by their confessor, so long as they were in a state of grace. Again, this work was approved by the censors of several orders.\n\nMolinos’s writings were clearly extremely popular. By 1685 seven editions had been printed in Italy and three in Spain. Translations of the book were made into Latin (1687), French (1688), Dutch (1688), English (1688), and German (1699) \n\nThe first attack on Molinos’s \"Guide\" (though without specifically mentioning the \"Guide\" or Molinos) appeared in 1678, written by Gottardo Bell’huomo. Molinos evidently felt that Bell’huomo’s book could not be ignored, because shortly after he wrote (though never published) an apologia for his \"Guide\" entitled \"Defence of Contemplation\", aiming to defend the \"Guide\" against charges of theological innovation. Specifically, he marshalled a long list of past writers and saints (including Francisco Suarez and Jean-Joseph Surin) in order to demonstrate that the \"Guide\"’s principal thesis – that in order to pass to the state of contemplation one must leave behind meditative practices (even though, aware of the focus of the writings of Ignatius of Loyola on meditation, and the likelihood that Jesuit writers would react poorly to any perceived attack on Ignatius’s thought, he was quick to emphasise that these are certainly an important stage of the spiritual life) – was a well-established part of church doctrine. Instead of publishing the book, Molinos took up his case with the superior general of the Jesuits, Giovanni Paolo Oliva. In a series of letters from February 1680 onwards, Molinos sought to assure Oliva that he had nothing but praise and respect for the Jesuits and their spirituality.\n\nA second moment of suspicion against Molinos arose in 1681. In March 1680, the Jesuit preacher Paolo Segneri wrote to Oliva, proposing a book defending meditation against the quietists’ teaching. Oliva encouraged him and forwarded copies of the letters he had recently sent to Molinos. Later in 1680, a book was published in Florence, titled \"Concordia tra la fatica e la quiete nell' orazione\" (\"Agreement Between Effort and Quiet in Prayer\"), with Oliva’s name signed as imprimatur. The book attacked Molinos’s views, though without mentioning his name.\n\nDuring 1680–1681, a series of responses appeared from both the quietists and the Jesuits. The matter was referred to the Inquisition. In late 1681, it pronounced that the \"Guida spirituale\" was perfectly orthodox, censured Segneri, and placed his book on the Index (later in 1681, Bellhuomo’s work was also placed on the Index).\n\nThe apparent Quietist victory, however, was short-lived. It is unclear why exactly this change happened, though one factor suggested has been disquiet caused in Rome the flourishing of Quietism outside Rome, and the reaction this was causing among its opponents. On 18 July 1685, Molinos was arrested by the pontifical guards and imprisoned in the Castel Sant’Angelo. At first his friends were confident of an acquittal, and it seems that many in Rome remained sympathetic to his beliefs, but matters gradually turned against him.\n\nIn spring 1687, Molinos was brought before a tribunal of the Holy Office of the Inquisition and asked to explain his teaching, with 263 questionable propositions from his works at stake. Although initially defending them, by May 1687 his attitude had changed and he confessed his errors of conduct and teaching and waived his opportunity to present a defence. By July, the tribunal had isolated 68 objectionable propositions and had prepared articles of censure for each.\n\nOn 23 August 1687, the entire case was read to the cardinal inquisitors, and on 2 September Molinos’s sentence (life in prison) was announced.\n\nOn 3 September Molinos made a public profession of his errors in the Dominican Church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva. On 20 November Pope Innocent XI ratified his condemnation in the bull \"Coelestis Pastor\", condemning 68 propositions from the \"Guida spirituale\" and other unpublished writings of its author.\n\nMolinos died nine years later in the prison of the Holy Office on 29 December 1696.\n\nFor the last three centuries, Molinos has chiefly been known as the main proponent of the most fundamental mystical heresy in Catholicism, a heresy which has come to be the touchstone for doctrinal judgements about correct and incorrect claims for mystical contact with God. Most assessments of him have been accordingly negative.\n\nIn the second half of the twentieth century, however, the assessment of Eulogio Pacho has been somewhat more circumspect, aware of the problematic bias in the various sources on Molinos. Bernard McGinn is not entirely forgiving of Molinos as a person, pointing out that it seems likely that he did, as he was accused, engage in sexual misconduct with some of his penitents during his work as a spiritual director. McGinn, however, is keen to point out how far the errors condemned in the bull \"Caelestis Pater\" do not in fact exist in the Spiritual Guide. Rather, he argues, the imprecision and lack of qualifications in Molinos’s work left him open to attack, and this was exacerbated by the fact that his book (with its various ambiguities) focused on certain issues (notably contemplation over meditation, interior quiet over vocal prayer, and passivity over pious action) which had become heated debates in the preceding century. Even today we do not know if the rumors of sexual misconduct were even made at his trial as the text of the record and the trial have yet to be released by the Vatican. His last words to a priest before entering his cell of imprisonment were: \"Good-by, Father. We shall meet again on the day of judgement. Then it will be seen if the truth was on your side or mine.\" \n\nHenry Longfellow wrote a sonnet about him. William James, in \"The Varieties of Religious Experience\" said he was a 'spiritual genius'.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He went first to his local village school and then continued his schooling at Elwick Road senior boys' school, West Hartlepool, becoming Head Boy. During World War I he witnessed the bombardment of West Hartlepool by the German High Seas Fleet on 16 December 1914. After leaving school at 15 he first worked as an office boy and a draughtsman, and then undertook an engineering apprenticeship. He joined the Merchant Navy, becoming a first engineer. Following the birth of his daughter in 1935 he became an engineer for West Hartlepool council. He moved to Bridlington in 1938 as works supervisor for the Corporation. Local authorities were responsible for air raid precautions and trained their own workforces in rescue work. Alderson attended an anti-gas school at Easingwold, near York, and became an instructor in the subject.\n\nHe worked as part-time Air Raid Warden, leading a detachment of rescue and demolition parties in Bridlington. The coastal town was soon attacked by Luftwaffe bombers, and residential areas were hit. On three occasions in August 1940, Alderson led rescue teams and entered dangerous buildings to rescue trapped civilians. He was the first person to receive the newly-instituted George Cross from the King, and in a radio broadcast at the time insisted that his award was for all the rescue parties in Bridlington. This interview can be heard in full on \"The Blitz\", an audiobook CD of wartime recordings.\n\nIn 1946, Alderson joined the East Riding of Yorkshire County Council workforce as an assistant highways surveyor. He then joined the new Civil Defence Corps, this time to protect the civilian population from nuclear warfare, rather than conventional bombs. On 28 October 1965 he died of lung cancer in Northfield Hospital at Driffield, Yorkshire. His George Cross is now on display at the Imperial War Museum alongside a medal from the RSPCA, awarded later in the war for rescuing two horses from a burning stable.\n\nThe \"London Gazette\" citation appeared in a supplement to the issue of 27 September 1940, dated 30 September 1940:\n\n"}

Originally a striker, McDonald can also play as an attacking midfielder.\n\nBorn in Melbourne, McDonald commenced his senior footballing career with Gippsland Falcons in the National Soccer League before moving to Great Britain in 2001. He subsequently played for a wide range of clubs, including representing Southampton in the Premier League and Celtic and Motherwell in the Scottish top flight.\n\nMcDonald represented Australia 26 times between 2006 and 2012. He was a member of the squad for the 2011 AFC Asian Cup, where Australia finished second, as well as the 1999 FIFA U-17 World Championship, 2001 FIFA World Youth Championship and 2003 FIFA World Youth Championship.\n\nMcDonald began his career at Doveton, before joining Casey Comets. He made three appearances on loan from his Victorian State League club, Cranbourne Comets, with Gippsland Falcons in the ANSL, where he became the club's youngest ever NSL player, replacing Jason Marsh, when making his first-team debut aged just fifteen.\n\nMcDonald started off as a trainee with Southampton in 2001 where he managed only three appearances (one first-team start and two as a substitute), being loaned to Huddersfield Town where again he had chances to play first team football. McDonald scored just once for Huddersfield, in a 2–1 defeat to Tranmere Rovers and Bournemouth (scoring once against Shrewsbury). Upon reaching the end of his contract with Southampton he signed for Wimbledon on a rolling monthly contract.\n\nHe had talks with Drogheda United in 2003 but failed to agree terms.\n\nMcDonald went on trial with Scottish Premier League club Dundee United, but failed to win a contract and instead signed for league rivals Motherwell in January 2004. After signing for Motherwell, McDonald had a slow start, scoring only one goal during the second half of the 2003–04 season despite impressive performances. The following season he scored 15 goals. McDonald famously scored two late goals against Celtic at the end of the 2004–05 season to deny them the Scottish Premier League title which was instead won by their arch-rivals Rangers. In the 2005–06 season, McDonald scored 11 goals in 35 appearances, and in the following season, scored 15 goals in 32 appearances. His goal against Falkirk on 25 November 2006, was the 5000th goal in the SPL since its formation in 1998. In his successful stint with \"Well\", he scored 45 goals in 108 appearances.\n\nIn December 2007, McDonald was named BBC Sportsound Player of the Year for his eight man-of-the-match performances throughout the 2006–07 season.\n\nIn March 2007, after a £400,000 bid from Rangers had been rejected in January, Motherwell accepted an offer of £700,000 from McDonald's boyhood favourites Celtic, with McDonald moving to Celtic Park at the start of the 2007–08 season.\n\nMcDonald made his competitive debut for Celtic in the first leg of the UEFA Champions League third qualifying-round match against Spartak Moscow at Luzhniki Stadium, assisting Paul Hartley for Celtic's goal as the game finished 1–1. His first goal for the club came in the second leg of the tie at Celtic Park. A mistake by Spartak defender Roman Shishkin allowed McDonald to slip in and hit the ball first time past Stipe Pletikosa. This match also ended 1–1, but Celtic won 4–3 on penalties. Just days later in an away league match against St Mirren, McDonald latched onto a long Gary Caldwell pass to lob Chris Smith from a tight angle and score his first SPL goal for the club. He followed that up with the winning goal in the final minute of their 2–1 UEFA Champions League group-stage win against A.C. Milan on 3 October and another last minute winner just days later at Gretna. In a pulsating clash with Old Firm rivals Rangers on 16 April 2008, McDonald set up his Dutch strike partner Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink for a last minute goal that kept Celtic in the 2007–08 SPL title race, before scoring a double and winning a penalty scored by Barry Robson in another vital 3–2 Old Firm victory eleven days later. At the end of the season, McDonald was rewarded with a new five-year deal at Parkhead and was nominated for SPL Player of the Year. He scored 25 goals in 36 league appearances in his first season at Celtic and was the top goalscorer during the 2007–08 season, beating the next highest goalscorer and strike partner Vennegoor of Hesselink by 10 goals. This breakthrough season included two hat-tricks; against Dundee United and former club Motherwell. In total, McDonald scored 31 times in his first season at Parkhead.\n\nMcDonald wore the number 27 shirt in his first season with Celtic, but in July 2008 he was given number 7, which he also wore at Motherwell. After a sluggish start to the 2008–09 season, not scoring in any of the first four games, he opened his account against Motherwell, scoring Celtic's third goal in a 4–2 win at Fir Park. On 5 November 2008 McDonald scored the opening goal in a 1–1 draw with Manchester United at Celtic Park in the Champions League with a well executed lob over Ben Foster. Only three days later, McDonald continued to haunt his former club Motherwell with a low strike from outside the penalty area. Celtic won this match 2–0. On 27 December 2008, he scored the only goal in a 1–0 victory at Ibrox during the Old Firm derby, helping his team bring the three points home. On 27 January 2009, McDonald scored twice in the dramatic 11–10 penalty shoot-out victory against Dundee United to send Celtic through to the League Cup final, which they won 2–0 against archrivals Rangers. This win gave McDonald his first domestic cup trophy at Celtic.\n\nMcDonald scored his 49th and 50th Celtic goals at Pittodrie against Aberdeen on 2 May as Celtic ran out 3–1 winners. On 3 July, McDonald was handed the Celtic captaincy for a pre-season game against Brisbane Roar, due to the injury to Stephen McManus and the departure of vice-captain Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink. On 5 August, he scored the opening goal against Dynamo Moscow in Russia, a game which Celtic went on to win 2–0, to progress to the final qualifying round of the Champions League. On 5 December, McDonald scored his 50th league goal for Celtic against Aberdeen. McDonald scored a total of 64 goals for Celtic.\n\nOn 7 January 2010, Celtic rejected a transfer bid from Premier League side Wigan Athletic for the Australian striker, but on 1 February – transfer deadline day – Celtic sold McDonald to Middlesbrough for a reported £3.5 million. He joined up with Gordon Strachan, whom he played under at Celtic and Southampton, and also rejoined four of his former teammates, Willo Flood, Barry Robson, Chris Killen and Stephen McManus. On 16 February 2010, he missed a penalty against Blackpool in a 2–0 loss. McDonald scored his first Middlesbrough goal in the Tyne-Tees derby against Newcastle on 13 March. After a return from injury, McDonald scored three times in four games against Crystal Palace, Sheffield Wednesday and Coventry City.\n\nMcDonald made a bright start to the 2010–11 season scoring twice in his first two games against Ipswich and Chesterfield in the League Cup. On 9 November 2010, he scored the second in Middlesbrough's 2–0 win over Scunthorpe. On 1 March 2011, McDonald scored the opener in his team's 1–1 draw with Nottingham Forest, he followed this by scoring the leveller in his team's 2–1 victory at home to Watford on 19 March 2011. McDonald followed this by scoring twice in two games, in two draws against Ipswich Town and Barnsley. On 23 April 2011, McDonald scored a hat-trick in Middlesbrough's 2–4 away win at Hull.\n\nMcDonald scored his first goal of the 2011–12 season in a 3–1 victory over Barnsley on 16 August 2011. On 5 November 2011, he got his first in 12 matches, scoring the only goal in Middlesbrough's 1–0 victory over Watford at the Riverside. He scored a brace in Middlesbrough's 2–2 draw with Blackpool. On 10 December, McDonald scored the only goal of the game against Brighton, after a defensive error from Casper Ankergren. McDonald continued his impressive form, as he scored Boro's second in a 3–2 victory, over Welsh side Cardiff City. McDonald then scored in the New Year's Eve clash against Peterborough at the Riverside, the game finished 1–1.\n\nOn 6 October 2012, McDonald made his first appearance of the season against Watford, as a first half sub, coming on for teammate Justin Hoyte, in which McDonald scored the winner in a 2–1 victory.

His form continued as he scored the winning goal in a Tees – Wear derby against Sunderland resulting in a 1–0 victory to the Boro.\n\nOn 23 July 2013, McDonald signed a two-year contract with Millwall. He scored his first goal for the club in a 1–0 victory over Charlton. McDonald left Millwall on 24 January 2015, with the club cancelling his contract.\n\nOn 26 February 2015, McDonald signed for Motherwell for a second time, agreeing a contract until the end of the 2014–15 season. He made his second debut on 28 February 2015, in a 2–1 win against Inverness CT. He scored his first goal since returning to the club on 7 March 2015, scoring with a free-kick in a 1–1 draw against Kilmarnock.\n\nOn 21 July 2015, McDonald signed a new one-year contract, with the option of a second. On 1 July 2016, McDonald signed a new one-year contact to stay at Motherwell. Later that month, Motherwell rejected an offer from an unnamed A-League side, later revealed to be the Western Sydney Wanderers, for McDonald.\n\nIn May 2017, Motherwell announced that McDonald would be leaving the club after he had decided not to take up the option of another year on his contract.\n\nFollowing his departure from Motherwell, McDonald was expected to return to Australia. However it was announced in July 2017 that he had signed for Scottish Championship club Dundee United on a one-year deal. After one season with United, McDonald was released at the end of his contract.\n\nOn 15 February 2019, McDonald came out of retirement to sign for Partick Thistle until the end of the season. McDonald scored on his debut for Thistle after coming off the bench in a 2-0 away win over Alloa. McDonald went onto play a massive role in helping Partick Thistle avoid relegation from the Scottish Championship, with McDonald scoring 7 goals in 13 appearances in all competitions for the Jags McDonald left the club at the end of the season to return to Australia.\n\nOn 8 May 2019, McDonald returned home to Melbourne and signed for new A-League club Western United ahead of the 2019–20 A-League season. His first goal for the new club came against Melbourne Victory in Round 4, scoring the winner in a come-from-behind 3-2 triumph.\n\nOn 16 January 2020, McDonald joined Brisbane Roar under Robbie Fowler, signing an 18-month contract.\n\nHaving represented Australia at under-17, under-20 and under-23 levels, McDonald made his international debut for Australia against Bahrain on 22 February 2006 in an Asian Cup qualifier.

It provides the legal foundation for the existence of the Republic of Maldives, sets out the rights and duties of the citizens of Maldives, and defines the structure of the Government of the Maldives. The current Constitution of Maldives was ratified by President Maumoon Abdul Gayyoom on 7 August 2008, and came into effect immediately, replacing and repealing the Constitution of 1998.\n\nThe current constitution is known by its short title, \"Constitution of the Republic of Maldives, 2008.\"\n\nThe first written Constitution of the Maldives was codified in the early twentieth century, on 22 December 1932 during the thirtieth year of the reign of Sultan Mohamed Shamsudeen Iskandar III.\n\nA thirteen-member committee began work on drafting the constitution on 22 March 1931. The acting Governor of Ceylon Bernard H. Bourdill provided technical expertise in its composition. A first draft was completed on 16 June 1931.\n\nWith the ratification of the first Constitution of the Maldives on 22 December, the first semblance of representative government came into effect. A set of credentials for the King was established – these states the King must be sane man, be of the Sunni Muslim faith and be from the ruling family. A cabinet of ministers and a parliament comprising forty seven members was also established.\n\nThe first constitution had 92 articles and a bill of rights guaranteeing equality before the law, freedom from arbitrary arrest and torture, protection of private property, freedom of expression, association and press, and a pension after 25 years of service to the state.\n\nThough a milestone, historical records note that the Maldives' first Constitution failed within nine months of ratification.\n\nThe newly established People's Majlis passed 40 laws during its short tenure. The new legislation established fines, penalized theft and as- sault, created a state trading company and regulated foreign trade through a Foreign Investments Act and Freighters Act. The new laws angered the public and influential foreign traders in the Maldives. Foreign traders who had a monopoly on imported food started a series of strikes on 26 July 1933, demanding that the new government's policies be repealed.\n\nThe result of the ensuing food insecurity was a public revolt. The founders of the constitution were banished to Colombo and the constitution was amended to 84 articles in June 1934. The Maldives' first constitution was reduced to 80 articles in 1937 and finally suspended shortly after World War II broke in 1940. A special Majlis at the time stated, \"The Constitution and General Provisions have been annulled as they do not fit the Maldives' situation\".\n\nOn 23 April 1942, Sultan Hassan Nooradeen sent a 17 article constitution to the Majlis saying he wanted \"a suitable constitution to exist in the Maldives\".\n\nThe \"small constitution\" handed the powers of the state to the monarchy, the foreign minister, and the People's Majlis. The People's Majlis was reduced to 6 appointed members and 27 elected members. The second constitution was amended in 1951 and reinstated freedom from arbitrary arrest and banishment and freedom of expression, speech and association. The 34 member People's Majlis' term was set to five years.\n\nIn 1950, the People's Majlis voted to abolish the monarchy and institute a republican government in the Maldives. A public referendum endorsed the change and a third constitution on 1 January 1953 established a presidential system of government in the Maldives for the first time.\n\nThe new democratic constitution comprising 30 articles established a president to be elected through a direct vote, a judiciary appointed by the president and a bicameral legislature – an 18-member senate and a 47-member House of Representatives.\n\nThe new constitution also limited the presidential term to five years, but appointed Al-Ameer Mohamed Ameen Dhoshimeyna Kilegefaanu as the first president of the Maldives. For the first time in Maldivian history, a woman was elected to the parliament.\n\nHowever, the Maldives' first republic was short-lived. A revolution on 21 August 1953 abolished the Republic. The country reverted to a Sultanate on 31 January 1954. The change was followed by the ratification of the fourth Constitution of Maldives on 7 March 1954. The fourth constitution declared the Maldives to be an \"elected monarchy\".\n\nA unicameral legislature was reinstated with 54 members, of which 6 were to represent the king, 46 to represent the people and two to represent businessmen. Only Maldivian men could vote to elect the People's Majlis.\n\nShortly after the Maldives won independence from the British Empire, the fourth constitution was repealed and a Second Republic was established under the rule of President Ibrahim Nasir in 1968. The new constitution declared: \"The Maldives is an independent and free state\". According to the fifth constitution, the president of the Maldives was to be elected through a secret vote of the 54 member People's Majlis.\n\nIn 1980, the second president of the second republic Maumoon Abdul Gayoom called for a special constitutional assembly consisting of cabinet ministers and People's Majlis members to amend the new constitution.\n\nAfter an 18-year long process, the fifth constitution of the Maldives was amended for the fourth time. Notable amendments included clauses permitting any individual who wished to stand for presidency to submit an application to the People's Majlis. The Majlis would then choose a candidate who then had to be approved through a public referendum.\n\nIn September 2003, unprecedented anti-government riots broke out in Male, sparked by deaths of four prison inmates. The September riots came shortly after the Majlis had unanimously endorsed President Gayoom as the sole candidate for a record sixth term in office.\n\nIn October 2003, Gayoom was elected by 90.3 percent of the popular vote. In his inaugural address, Gayoom promised various political reforms. Gayoom's first steps were to institute a human rights commission in 2003 to investigate abuses and to establish a constitutional assembly in May 2004 to draft a democratic constitution.\n\nThe constitution was to guarantee separation of powers and a multi-party democracy.\n\nThe constitutional assembly—the People's Special Majlis— consisted of 29 appointees, along with 42 elected members of the regular Majlis and a further 42 elected members.\n\nThe drafting process was slow with rival political parties at loggerheads over several issues including the opposition proposed adoption of a parliamentary system in the Maldives. A public referendum was called in August 2007, and 60 percent of the public backed a presidential system of government.\n\nThe sixth constitution of the Maldives, ratified in August 2008, introduced a whole new set of democratic rights, enshrined the separation of powers and introduced mechanisms for accountability and transparency. It paved the way for Maldives' first multi-party elections in October 2008.\n\nAfter the second republic was declared, new president Ibrahim Nasir ratified a new constitution on 11 November 1968. This constitution was amended thrice, in 1970, 1972 and 1975 respectively.\n\nUnder the rule of president Maumoon Abdul Gayyoom, a 12th constitution was introduced in 1998. The government proclaimed that this change was brought to encourage the people of the country to live in friendship, amity and co-operation, and to encourage good deeds and respect among one another and being just, and to live in equality and fraternity.\n\nIn June 2008, an assembly, called the \"Special Majlis\", completed a new constitution. It was ratified by the president on 7 August 2008. This constitution was written over a period of 4 years, started in 2003 when President Gayyoom promised a new 'modern, multi-party and democratic system' in the country following the 2003 Maldives civil unrest and others that followed.\nThis new constitution includes a judiciary run by an independent commission, and independent commissions to oversee elections and fight corruption. It also reduces the executive powers vested under the president and strengthens the parliament. Among other changes, it states that \"a non-Muslim may not become a citizen of the Maldives\".\n\nThe constitution consists of a preamble, fourteen chapters followed by three schedules. Each chapter and schedule focus on a specific topic. The following is a list of chapters and schedules and the focus of each.\n\n\n\n, there has been 1 amendment made to the Constitution of the Maldives, since it was enacted in 2008.\n\n\n"}

Montañés executed most of his sculpture in wood, which was gessoed, polychromed and gilded.\n\nOther works were the great altars at Santa Clara in Seville and at San Miguel in Jerez, the Immaculate Conception and the realistic figure of Christ Crucified in \"Cristo de la Clemencìa\", commissioned in 1603, in the sacristy of Seville cathedral (\"illustration\"); the figure of St John the Baptist, and the St Bruno (1620); a tomb for Don Pérez de Guzmán and his wife (1619); the highly realistic polychromed wood head and hands of St Ignatius of Loyola (1610) and of St Francis Xavier in the university church of Seville, where the costumed figures were used in celebrations.\n\nMontañés achieved great fame in his lifetime; he died in 1649, leaving a large family. His works are more realistic than imaginative, but this, allied with an impeccable taste, produced remarkable results. In 1635, in preparation for the bronze equestrian statue of King Philip IV by Pietro Tacca, Montañés went to Madrid and spent seven months there modelling a portrait of Philip IV. The work was sent to Tacca in Florence as primary reference for the King, and the statue was finished in 1640. During his stay in Madrid he had his portrait painted by Diego Velázquez, whose tutor had worked for him.\n\nHe had many imitators, including his son Alonzo Martínez, who died in 1668. His students included Juan de Mesa.\n\n\n"}

He was raised in Burlington and Hamilton, Ontario.\n\nAt the height of the Battle of Britain when the Hurricane was the principal British fighter aircraft, Lieutenant Patton was a chemical engineering officer in the 1st Battalion, Corps of Royal Canadian Engineers, recently arrived in Britain and based at Boxhill, near Dorking, Surrey. On 21 September, at 8.30 am when he was leading a team clearing debris at the bomb-damaged Vickers-Armstrongs aircraft factory at Brooklands near Weybridge, a lone Luftwaffe Junkers Ju88 attacked the Hawker Hurricane factory on the South-West side of Brooklands. Two of the three bombs dropped failed to explode and, despite having no previous experience of bomb disposal, Patton soon attended the scene. One unexploded bomb was buried under part of the factory floor but another had passed through the main building and ended up on an adjacent hardstanding. Patton decided that the unexploded bomb had to be removed as soon as possible before it damaged the vital factory, so with the help of four others (including his adjutant Captain Douglas W C Cunnington and Vickers Home Guard Section Leader A H Tilyard-Burrows ), he rolled it onto a sheet of corrugated iron and secured it to the back of a 15cwt truck. While Patton sat on the tailgate of the lorry to watch over the bomb, Cunnington towed the bomb out onto the aerodrome where it was then rolled very carefully into an existing bomb crater where it subsequently exploded harmlessly the next morning. Patton was awarded the George Cross for his bravery (Cunnington and Tilyard-Burrows were awarded the George Medal) and subsequently served in India and Burma fighting against the Japanese.\n\nAfter the war he received Canadian citizenship as a result of his participation with the Royal Canadian Engineers. He was also made an Honorary Member of the Royal Engineers Bomb Disposal Association.\n\nIn February 1944, the City of Hamilton was given of land for park use by Thomas Hambly Ross, MP (Hamilton East), and his wife Olive. This park was originally named Ross Park but was renamed Patton Park in 1946, in honour of Captain John MacMillan Stevenson Patton. In 1960, the park was again renamed to honour Samuel Lawrence. From 1990 to 1994, Sam Lawrence Park saw a major upgrading that included repairing stone walls, installing new walkways, lighting, site furniture, and redevelopment of the major rock gardens. \"Sam Lawrence Park\" can be found on the western-end of Concession Street in Hamilton, Ontario. Prior to 1944, this property was the Webb Quarry.\n\n\n"}

He is credited as an innovator of vocalese, a musical style in which lyrics are set to an instrumental composition or solo. Jefferson himself claims that his main influence was Leo Watson. Perhaps Jefferson's best-known song is \"Moody's Mood for Love\", though it was first recorded by King Pleasure, who cited Jefferson as an influence. Jefferson's songs \"Parker's Mood\" and \"Filthy McNasty\" were also hits.\n\nJefferson was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. One of his most notable recordings, \"So What\", combined the lyrics of artist Christopher Acemandese Hall with the music of Miles Davis to highlight his skills, and enabled him to turn a phrase, into his style he calls jazz vocalese.\n\nJefferson's last recorded performance was at the Joe Segal's Jazz Showcase in Chicago and was released on video by Rhapsody Films. He shared the stand with Richie Cole (alto sax), John Campbell (piano), Kelly Sill (bass) and Joel Spencer (drums). The performance was part of a tour that Jefferson and Cole led together. Their opening night in Detroit, Michigan, was at Baker's Keyboard Lounge, a jazz club built in the 1930s that has played host to famous musicians including musicians who spanned the genre with artists as diverse as Dexter Gordon and Sonny Stitt.\n\nA previously unreleased live recording from July 1976 was released in August 2009 as \"Eddie Jefferson At Ali's Alley\", with the quintet of drummer Rashied Ali featured.\n\nEddie Jefferson was shot and killed at Baker's Keyboard Lounge on May 8, 1979, aged 60. He had left the club with fellow bandleader Cole around 1:35 a.m. and was shot while walking out of the building. A late-model Lincoln Continental was spotted speeding away from the scene. The driver was later picked up by Detroit police and identified as a disgruntled dancer with whom Jefferson once worked and had fired from a gig. The suspect was charged with murder, but was later acquitted in a Detroit criminal trial.\n\nThe Manhattan Transfer honored both Jefferson and Coleman Hawkins in their vocal version of \"Body and Soul\" on their album \"Extensions\" in 1979.\n\n\nWith James Moody\n\nWith Richie Cole\n\nWith Dexter Gordon\n\n\n"}

His parents left Russia and emigrated to New York City in 1906. Cashwan began his art studies after the family moved to Detroit in 1916. His first exposure to art came from his art teacher, Katherine Conover at Detroit's Central High School. Cashwan then took art course at the John Wicker School of Art in Detroit and later at Detroit City College.\n\nIn 1918, Cashwan served in the US Army. He was discharged following the end of World War I and returned to New York City, where he continued with his art training at the Architectural League of New York. Cashwan then moved to Paris from 1923 to 1926 where he attended the École des Beaux-Arts under the sculptor Antoine Bourdelle. He returned to Detroit in 1927 and became an art instructor at the University of Michigan. Cashwan also served as the head of the sculpture department of the Detroit Society of Arts and Crafts until 1942. Cashwan was also employed by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) from 1936 until 1942 as the supervisor of its sculpture and ceramics program. He was to credit the income from these teaching positions to allow art to his own tastes rather than that of the art market.\n\nDuring his time at the WPA, Cashwan created several sculptures for outside display at Michigan State University. At the Olin Health Center, he created bas-reliefs of the Greek gods Panacea and Hygeia. AT one of the University entrances, he created a sculpture of a man, a woman, a horse and several sheafs of wheat. These figures symbolized the university's beginnings as a school of agriculture.\n\nIn January, 1942, Cashwan exhibited sculptural work at an opening of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.\n\nFollowing the end of World War II, Cashwan was hired as a designer for General Motors, a position that he held until his retirement in 1965. He moved to North Carolina shortly thereafter, where he lived until his death in 1988.\n\nWhile Cashwan suggested that his work had been influenced by both Romanesque and Hindu sculpture, as his career progress his work developed along more and more abstract lines. By the late 1930s, his figural work had become very angular, stressing sharp lines and large volumes. His pieces created following World War II were even more abstract, his later ones having altogether abandoned figural reference.\n\nLike many of the sculptors of his day Cashwan was endowed with both the skills and the opportunity to work with architects and create architectural sculpture. Buildings adorned by his hand can be found in both Lansing, Michigan and Detroit.\n\n\n\n\n"}

These crashes often occur at intersections, in parking lots, and when two vehicles pass on a multi-lane roadway.\n\nFor fatalities, in the United States, in 2008, a total of 5,265 (22%) out of 23,888 people were killed in vehicles which were struck in the side.\n\nFor speed, in Europe in 2015, it is considered that best designed cars provide serious front crash protection with speeds up to 70 km/h for car occupants wearing seat belts in frontal impacts and 50 km/h in side impacts It is considered that passenger car fatalities and seriously \ninjured side impacts account for about 35 to 40%. In most European countries, another stakeholder is involved in the side impact, with a rate between 45% and 66%. But side impact (22% to 29%) is less common that frontal impact (61% to 69%).\n\nFor European motorcyclists, side impact is the second most frequent location of impact.\n\nFor European cyclist, thorax injuries are associated with side-impact injuries in urban areas and/or at junctions.\n\nIn European countries, such as UK, Sweden and France, around one quarter of traffic injuries are produced by side collision, but among people subject to killing injuries the side impact account for 29 to 38% of those fatal injuries.\n\nIn European vehicle side impact, 60% of casualties were \"struck side\", while 40% were \"non struck side\", in 2018.\n\nFatal casualties count as 50% and 67% in UK and in France, in 2010\n\nAlso, side collision are not well managed with child restraints which are not enough taking into account the movement of the child's head and prevent contact with the car's interior.\n\nFor light vans and minibuses in 2000 in UK and Germany, between 14% and 26% of accidents with passenger cars are side impact\n\nIn Shanghai, in China, 23% of the 1097 serious accidents occurred between June 2005 and March 2013 are side impact accidents, there the leading collision mode, according to the Shanghai United Road Traffic Safety Scientific Research Center (SHUFO) database. The head and neck are involved in around 64% of the casualties..\n\nBroadside collisions are where the side of one vehicle is impacted by the front or rear of another vehicle, forming a \"T\". In the United States and Canada this collision type is also known as right-angle collision or T-bone collision; it is also sometimes referred to by the abbreviation \"AABS\" for \"auto accident, broadside\". Vehicle damage and occupant injury are more likely to be severe, but severity varies based on the part of the vehicle that is struck, safety features present, the speeds of both vehicles, and vehicle weight and construction.\n\nWhen a vehicle is hit on the side by another vehicle, the crumple zones of the striking vehicle will absorb some of the kinetic energy of the collision. The crumple zones of the struck vehicle may also absorb some of the collision's energy, particularly if the vehicle is not struck on its passenger compartment. Both vehicles are frequently turned from their original directions of travel. If the collision is severe, the struck vehicle may be spun or rolled over, potentially causing it to strike other vehicles, objects, or pedestrians. After the collision, the involved vehicles may be stuck together by the folding of their parts around each other.\n\nAn occupant on the struck side of a vehicle may sustain far more severe injuries than an otherwise similar front or rear collision crash.\n\nSide-impact airbags can protect vehicle occupants during side collisions, but they face the same limitations as other airbags. Additionally, side impact wrecks are more likely to involve multiple individual collisions or sudden speed changes before motion ceases. Since the airbag can only provide protection during the first collision, it may leave occupants unprotected during subsequent collisions in the crash. However, the first collision in a crash typically has the most severe forces, so an effective airbag provides maximum benefit during the most severe portion of a crash.\n\nBroadside collisions are frequently caused by a failure to yield right of way. In the case of collisions in an intersection, the cause is often a result of one vehicle failing to obey traffic signals (fail to stop or running past a red light). As with any crash, increased speed may increase crash severity.\n\nEuro NCAP, IIHS and NHTSA test side impacts in different ways. , they all test vehicle-to-vehicle side impacts, where heavier vehicles have lower fatality rates than lighter vehicles.\n\nNHTSA and EuroNCAP also test the more severe vehicle-into-pole side impacts, where smaller vehicles have the same fatality rate as larger vehicles.\n\nNewer cars have improved safety of front crashes, but side impacts are also deadly; about 9,700 people were killed in side impacts in the US in 2004.\n\nSide airbags became mandatory in 2009 in the USA, saving an estimated 1,000 lives per year.\n\nResearch indicates that the vehicle's underbody is the best place to reinforce structures to reduce intrusion by the pole.\n\nThese are lists of cars with notable aspects of side impact.\n\nThe NHTSA results are evaluated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration using Office of Crashworthiness Standards, New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) Side Impact Laboratory Test Procedure and Side Impact Rigid Pole Laboratory Test Procedure to display a simple star-rating. The \"primary purpose of the NCAP side impact program is to provide comparative vehicle side protection information to assist consumers in making vehicle purchase decisions, thereby providing an incentive for vehicle manufacturers to design safer vehicles.\"\n\nThe IIHS results are evaluated by Insurance Institute for Highway Safety using their protocols.\n\nThis list shows the most notable of newer tested vehicles tested via NHTSA and IIHS. Some provide good protection, some less so, and some developed improved safety in response to a low result (Dodge Ram and Fiat 500).

He was brought up, until he went to a tutor's, by his kinswoman Kristín Vigfússdóttir, to whom, he records, he owed not only that he became a man of letters but almost everything. He was sent to the old school at Bessastaðir and (when it moved there) at Reykjavík. In 1849, already a fair scholar, he came to Copenhagen University in the Regense College, where as an Icelander he received four-years free boarding under the Garðsvist system.\n\nAfter his student course, he was appointed \"stipendiarius\" by the Arna-Magnaean trustees, and worked for fourteen years in the Arna-Magnaean Library until, as he said, he knew every scrap of old vellum and of Icelandic written paper in that whole collection.\n\nIn 1866, he settled in Oxford, which he made his home for the rest of his life. He held the office of Reader in Scandinavian at Oxford University (a post created for him) from 1884 till his death. He was made a Jubilee Doctor of Uppsala in 1877, and received the Danish order of the Dannebrog in 1885.\n\nGuðbrandur died of cancer on 31 January 1889. He was buried in St. Sepulchre's Cemetery, Oxford, on 3 February, 1889.\n\nHe was an excellent judge of literature, reading most European languages well and being acquainted with their classics. His memory was remarkable, and if the Eddic poems had ever been lost, he could have written them all down from memory. He spoke English well, with a strong Icelandic accent. He wrote a beautiful, distinctive and clear hand, in spite of (or because of) the thousands of lines of manuscript copying he had done in his early life.\n\nHis \"Tímatöl\" (written between October 1854 and April 1855) laid the foundations for the chronology of Icelandic history. His editions of Icelandic classics (1858–1868), \"Biskupa sögur\", \"Bárðar Saga\", \"Fornsögur\" (with Mobius), \"Eyrbyggia Saga\" and \"Flateyarbók\" (with Carl Rikard Unger) opened a new era of Icelandic scholarship. They can be compared to the Rolls Series editions of chronicles by William Stubbs, for the interest and value of their prefaces and texts.\n\nHe spent the seven years 1866–1873 on the \"Oxford Icelandic-English Dictionary\", often denoted by the shorthand \"Cleasby-Vigfusson\", the best guide to classic Icelandic, and a monumental example of single-handed work. The end-product was more a product of Guðbrandur Vigfússon's undertaking than Cleasby's, and is characterized as his most important legacy. \n\nHis later series of editions (1874–1885) included \"Orkneyinga Saga\" and \"Háconar Saga\", the great and complex mass of Icelandic historical sagas known as \"Sturlunga\", and the \"Corpus Poeticum Boreale\", in which he edited the entire body of classic Scandinavian poetry. As an introduction to the \"Sturlunga\", he wrote a complete, concise history of the classic Northern literature and its sources. In the introduction to the Corpus, he laid the foundations of a critical history of the Eddic poetry and Court poetry of the North in a series of well-supported theories.\n\nHis little \"Icelandic Prose Reader\" (with F. York Powell) (1879) furnishes a path to a sound knowledge of Icelandic. The \"Grimm Centenary Papers\" (1886) give good examples of the range of his historic work, while his Appendix on Icelandic currency to Sir G. W. Dasent's \"Burnt Njal\" is a methodical investigation into an intricate subject.\n\nAs a writer in his own tongue, he once gained a high position by his \"Relations of Travel in Norway and South Germany\". In English, as his \"Visit to Grimm\" and his powerful letters to \"The Times\" show, he had attained no mean skill. His life is mainly a record of well-directed and efficient labor in Denmark and Oxford.\n\n\n"}

A majority of patients may have blood in the urine and protein in the urine. Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis may occur. Because many different organ systems may be involved, a wide range of symptoms are possible in MPA.\n\nPurpura and livedo racemosa may be present.\n\nWhile the mechanism of disease has yet to be fully elucidated, the leading hypothesis is that the process is begun with an autoimmune process of unknown cause that triggers production of p-ANCA. These antibodies will circulate at low levels until a pro-inflammatory trigger — such as infection, malignancy, or drug therapy. The trigger upregulates production of p-ANCA. Then, the large number of antibodies make it more likely that they will bind a neutrophil. Once bound, the neutrophil degranulates. The degranulation releases toxins that cause endothelial injury. Most recently, two different groups of investigators have demonstrated that anti-MPO antibodies alone can cause necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis.\n\nLaboratory tests may reveal an increased sedimentation rate, elevated CRP, anemia and elevated creatinine due to kidney impairment. An important diagnostic test is the presence of perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCA) with myeloperoxidase specificity (a constituent of neutrophil granules), and protein and red blood cells in the urine.\n\nIn patients with neuropathy, electromyography may reveal a sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy. \n\nThe signs and symptoms of microscopic polyangiitis may resemble those of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) (another form of small-vessel vasculitis) but typically lacks the significant upper respiratory tract involvement (e.g., sinusitis) frequently seen in people affected by GPA.\n\nThe customary treatment involves long term dosage of prednisone, alternated or combined with cytotoxic drugs, such as cyclophosphamide or azathioprine.\n\nPlasmapheresis may also be indicated in the acute setting to remove ANCA antibodies.\n\nRituximab has been investigated, and in April 2011 approved by the FDA when used in combination with glucocorticoids in adult patients.\n\n"}

It has been popular in the United States from the late 19th century until the 1930s, and still one of the most common building materials found in U.S. urban environments. It is the glazed version of architectural terracotta; the material in both its glazed and unglazed versions is sturdy and relatively inexpensive, and can be molded into richly ornamented detail. Glazed terra-cotta played a significant role in architectural styles such as the Chicago School and Beaux-Arts architecture.\n\nThe material, also known in Great Britain as faience and sometimes referred to as \"architectural ceramics\", was closely associated with the work of Cass Gilbert, Louis Sullivan, and Daniel H. Burnham, among other architects. Buildings incorporating glazed terra-cotta include the Woolworth Building in New York City and the Wrigley Building in Chicago.\n\nGlazed architectural terra-cotta offered a modular, varied and relatively inexpensive approach to wall and floor construction. It was particularly adaptable to vigorous and rich ornamental detailing. It was created by Luca della Robbia (1400–1482), and was used in most of his works.\n\nTerra-cotta is an enriched molded clay brick or block. It was usually hollow cast in blocks which were open in the back, with internal stiffeners called webbing. Webbing substantially strengthened the hollow blocks with minimal weight increase. The blocks were finished with a glaze, with a clay wash or an aqueous solution of metal salts, before firing. Late 19th century advertising for the material promoted the durable, impervious and adaptable nature of glazed architectural terra-cotta. It could accommodate subtle nuances of modeling, texture and color. Compared to stone, it was easier to handle, quickly set and lower cost. The cost of producing the blocks, when compared to carving stone, was a considerable saving, especially when casts were used in a modular fashion—that is, used repeatedly. It never needed paint, and periodic washings restored its appearance.\n\nVariations in the color and pattern of the glaze could make it look like granite or limestone; this flexibility helped make it attractive for architects.\n\nFour major types of terra-cotta were widely used\n\nThe American Terra Cotta Corporation, founded in 1881, operated for eighty-five years in the little town of Terra Cotta in the heart of Illinois dairy country (near Crystal Lake, Illinois). The company fabricated architectural terra cotta for more than 8,000 buildings throughout the U.S. and Canada. It was the last exclusive manufacturer of architectural terra cotta by the time it ceased production in 1966. From its founding, in time to rebuild the fire-ravished city of Chicago, until its closing, it was the major producer of architectural glazed terra cotta in North America.\n\nGuastavino tile was used in many places, including the Bridgemarket under the Manhattan side of the Queensboro Bridge.\n\n\nAlthough glazed terra-cotta was much more common in the US, it was used in central Canada starting around 1900, on many of the area's first skyscrapers. The glazed terra-cotta used in central Canada was usually imported from the US or England.\n\nFrom around 1880 unglazed terra-cotta was supplanted by the glazed version - faience, and glazed brick - which were easily cleaned, and not blackened by city smoke, notably by the Burmantofts Pottery company which also exported to Paris and Montreal.\n\nFaience was popularised in Melbourne in the 1920s by architects such as Harry Norris. One of the leading commercial architects of the time in the city, Norris was strongly influenced by trends in American architecture and used faience on projects such as the Nicholas Building and the Kellow Falkiner Showrooms (a 1928 car showroom) in South Yarra. In Sydney, it featured on notable buildings such as BMA House, designed by Joseph Charles Fowell. Australian-made tiles were available from Wunderlich Tiles, a company founded by London-born Frederick Wunderlich.\n\n\n\n"}

The son of a rich merchant, he inherited substantial wealth. His life of pleasure was interrupted by a spiritual experience, after which he became a devout religious teacher. Nicholas was called by his followers the \"Great Layman\" or the \"Great Friend of God\". This has led to some confusion that he was a leader of the 14th century lay mystical society the Friends of God, although this has been discounted. Nicholas' teachings that, although not ordained, he had the authority to use episcopal and priestly powers, that submission to his direction was necessary for attaining spiritual perfection, and that his followers could not sin even though they committed crimes or disobeyed both Church and pope were at odds with those of the Dominican-inspired Friends of God. His teachings are akin to some of the more radical Beghards and the Brethren of the Free Spirit.\n\nThough vigorously sought after by the Inquisition, he eluded its agents for many years until around 1395 he was seized in Vienna, and burned at the stake as a heretic, together with two of his followers, John and James. A considerable legend has attached itself to Nicholas through the persistent but mistaken identification of him with the mysterious \"Friend of God from the Oberland,\" the \"double\" of Rulman Merswin, the Strasbourg banker who was one of the leaders of the 14th-century German mystics known as the Friends of God.\n\nChristian anarchism\n"}

The game was released on November 2, 2004. It is based on the board game series \"Axis & Allies\" from Milton Bradley and also on TimeGate's . Set in the years after Japan and the United States entered into the war, the game allows the player to act as a WWII commander to build military forces to fight against other generals, using and technologies from the war. Thus, the player is able to rewrite and recreate the history of WWII. Correspondingly, the game's tagline is, \"World War II is in your hands.\"\n\nThe game as a whole is TimeGate's best-selling game release, upon the company's closure in 2013. The game performed decent in reviews and was received with satisfaction, although some review sites claimed the game fell short in terms of AI mechanics and in an overemphasis on base management.\n\nAxis & Allies RTS is the name used to distinguish the game from \"Axis & Allies\", the name of the popular board game series. Axis & Allies: Collector's Edition was released as a new name for the game on August 28, 2006 by new distributor Encore Software.\n\nIn \"Axis & Allies\", the player assumes the role of a military general of one of the five superpowers of World War II: the United States, Great Britain, Germany, Russia, and Japan. Each nation has access to its own unique military units, such as snipers for Russia, flamethrower tanks for Great Britain, and king tiger tanks for Germany. Four generals exist for each nation, with each general having access to unique Special Operation abilities, such as summoning fake tanks, deploying a secret agent, or giving an area buff to friendly units. Particularly noteworthy are the most expensive Special Operations, which include large damaging area of effect abilities such as carpet bombing, kamikazes, V-weapons, and nuclear bombs.\n\nThe player battles against other generals in one of three game modes: World War II, custom game, and campaign mode. Gameplay is played mainly in the real-time strategy genre, though turn-based strategy is used in WWII mode. The primary objective of gameplay is to destroy all opposing enemy military forces, though some campaigns and maps require other objectives to be completed, such as capturing certain cities, escorting a caravan, or defending a specific area. A \"City Control\" percentage option may be enabled, in which the winner of the battle goes to the first side/team to capture a set percentage of cities on the map.\n\nLike in other RTS games, the player must expend resources to construct buildings and recruit units to fight the enemy, while maintaining an economy, progressing through a build tree, and researching upgrades. In standard gameplay, the player deploys building trucks from a Corps HQ, the main military headquarters building. These building trucks can \"unpack\" into all other essential buildings, which aid in producing combat units, technologies, and the three major resources of the game: money, ammo, and oil. Money is obtained as a constant flow of revenue from specific buildings and is used to purchase combat units and technologies, whereas ammo and oil are static resources provided by buildings, and are used for combat unit upkeep. Combat units of their corresponding types are deployed from four classes of buildings: Infantry, Airborne, Mechanized, and Armor Division HQs.\n\n\"Axis & Allies\" also includes special gameplay features, such as regimental control, chained supply, and morale.\n\n\"Regiments\" are the base combat groups that the player can control. A regiment is composed of a certain squad of units, where a unit can be, for example, an Anti-Tank Infantry, a Halftrack, or a Light Tank. The player controls the entire regiment as a whole, but cannot select and control its individual units. Every unit within a regiment is different, for example, a tank destroyer will paralyze units while mortar units will splash bombard. A regiment can be toggled into three states of unit formation, which trade the regiment's movement speed for attack efficiency, meaning hit-and-run attacks are less damaging than slow advances. There is also a feature called \"entrenchment\" in which a regiment gains a large defensive bonus if idle for a certain period of time. Furthermore, regiments gain experience from battles and have four tiers of veterancy, which improve the attack and defense of the regiment's units with each level.\n\nThe game includes three types of units: ground units, air units, and naval units. All regiments are made up of ground units; they are blocked by mountains and slowed by forests, sand, and cities, though infantry units gain a defensive bonus while in forests or cities. Secondly, air units can fly over mountains, but they move and attack automatically; they can be deployed but not controlled by the player. Thirdly, naval units travel in water, but can neither be healed nor recruited, and thus they only appear in campaigns.\n\nIn addition, the game employs a feature called a zone of supply for replenishing regiments, defined by a surrounding green border. Regiments heal and replace missing troops within the zone of supply through \"chaining\" to Division HQs of their type. The player's main Corps HQ, as well as cities, are the primary sources for emanating the zone of supply. Other buildings can extend the zone of supply so that regiments far from a base of operations can replenish troops. In addition, most buildings are able to be packed and relocated to redraw supply lines, if needed.\n\nBattles are also fought around a special feature called morale, which represents a regiment's tendency to rout from battle. Each regiment features a morale bar, which decreases as the regiment is engaged in battle. If morale drops below a threshold, the regiment's banner will flash white and the regiment makes an uncontrolled retreat away from the enemy. If the morale bar reaches zero, the regiment becomes frozen in place until it either gains its morale back or is killed. This makes prolonging battles costly, but the player can avoid regiments from routing by manually retreating them before their morale drops too low. Enemy artillery fire and flame attacks diminish the morale bar more rapidly. Some Special Operation abilities are used to affect the morale of friendly and enemy units.\n\nWWII mode is a game mode which allows the player to wage war across the globe in a traditional turn-based fashion. It resembles a turn-based computer variant of the \"Axis & Allies\" board games, but with the option to fight battles in RTS mode. The player fights WWII in how they see fit, effectively \"changing the course of history.\"\n\nAt the start, the player chooses a nation and a general to play as, then the game displays a game board showing a panoramic map of the world with territory tiles. A number of territories, such as Australia or Germany, have defensive pieces already in place. The player and computer players take turns purchasing infantry, mechanized, armor, and air support pieces from their home country and move them across the map to engage enemy armies and territories. Each nation has reduced recruitment cost for a specific military piece; for example, Germany recruits cheaper armor pieces, Russia has cheaper infantry pieces, and Japan has cheaper air support pieces. Moreover, each nation can purchase technologies to increase the chance that its battles will be successful; these are the same researches encountered in RTS mode. Either the Allies or Axis wins when two capitals of the opposing side are conquered.\n\nBattles that occur are chosen by the player to be fought in either of two ways: as a \"quick resolve\" battle or as an \"RTS battle\". \"Quick resolves\" are computerized simulations of the battles and the outcome is immediate. Probability of victory is based on army sizes and technologies researched by the attacking and defending armies. In contrast, \"RTS battles\" are fought using the normal real-time strategy mode. These battles procedurally generate their maps from the board game state. The quantity of military pieces attacking and defending a territory determines each player's starting money and starting forces in the RTS battle. Furthermore, the particular types of pieces contesting a territory restricts the types of units (i.e. infantry, mechanized, armor, air) that each player is able to deploy. A special feature is that if pieces converge to attack from multiple territories, forces appear in the corresponding directions in the battle. In addition, these battles take place in the appropriate biomes of the contested territories (e.g. island, coastal region, desert, forestland).\n\nThere are only two major resources in WWII mode: money and technologies. Money is used to purchase military pieces and technologies. It is obtained every turn as the sum of the income values of controlled territories. Technologies, on the other hand, are purchased to increase the probability of victory in \"quick resolve\" battles. Purchasing technologies also pre-researches them in RTS battles.\n\nThe primary rules of the board game are as follows. If an attacking army defeats a defending army, the weakest piece of the defeated army is destroyed and the rest of the army retreats to a nearby allied territory. If the defending army is unable to retreat to nearby allied territory (i.e. completely surrounded), then the entire army is destroyed. However, if the defender is the victor, then the weakest piece of the attacker's army is destroyed and the rest of the attacking army retreats back to their original territory. If a piece moves into a neutral territory or an abandoned enemy territory, it will automatically capture that territory at the start of the next turn.\n\nIn contrast to the \"Axis & Allies\" board games, each player can only attack one territory per turn. Also, naval and air units are not built on the board but appear only during an RTS battle resolution. Moreover, each movable game piece is only given a movement speed of one tile.\n\nCustom battle is a game mode in which real-time strategy battles are played on either a randomly generated map or on a pre-built map. Both randomly-generated and pre-built maps allow up to 8 players, and are played with the computer or online with real players. For randomly-generated maps, the player is allowed to choose the map's biome (e.g. desert, jungle, grassland), what land features are present on the map (e.g. mountains, forests, sand), how much money and experience points each player starts out with, and many other options. \"Axis & Allies\"' built-in random map generator then procedurally generates the map according to the terrain options selected. When playing on a randomly generated map, each player always starts in random locations on the map with the iconic setup of a primary Corps HQ building, some bunker defenses, and a supply depot truck. Gameplay proceeds as usual until a victor is decided by the victory condition of either destroying all enemies or capturing a set percentage of cities, if that option is set.\n\nThe \"Axis & Allies\" Map Editor allows players to make their own custom battle maps to play in both singleplayer and multiplayer mode. Players are able to customize many map options, including player starting units, scenery objects, terrain layout, audio sources, and game triggers. Game triggers allow for custom creation of cutscenes, unit & VFX spawns, storylines, and military objectives.\n\nMultiplayer games are played in the format of a custom battle; the other two game modes, WWII mode and Campaign mode, are not available for online play. Online players play in solo or team battles on randomly generated maps, or on official or player-created maps. A maximum of 12 players is allowed to join a single game, but only a maximum of 8 players is allowed to actually play. Players who are not playing are allowed to spectate in-game. Players can save multiplayer films, host rooms and games, and make friends and add them to their buddy lists. Online service was supported by GameSpy Arcade, a free online player-matching service. At the beginning of December 2012, GameSpy discontinued online server service to users. However, user direct-connect LAN services can still function.\n\nIn Campaign mode, the player is thrust into a series of World War II campaign battles for either the Axis Powers (Germany and Japan) or the Allied Nations (United States, Great Britain, and Russia) throughout the years of 1941–1945. There are a total of 24 campaign missions: 12 for the Allied and 12 for the Axis.\n\nPlaying as the Allies, the course of history goes the way it actually did with the Battle of Normandy sealing Germany's fate and the capture of Iwo Jima and Okinawa sealing Japan's. The campaigns interchange between the armies of Great Britain, Russia, and the United States of America as time progresses.\n\nPlaying as the Axis leads to an alternate history of WWII, based on what-if scenarios. The campaign begins with a tactical German victory in the Battle of Crete. Having driven out British forces in the Mediterranean, Rommel and his Afrika Korps win the Battle of El Alamein, pushing the British all the way back through the Suez Canal. With the fuel-rich Middle East in German hands, Germany wins the decisive Battle of Stalingrad and the following year, the endlessly supplied Panzer units crush the Russians at Kursk, effectively sealing the fate of the Eastern Front. Meanwhile, in the Pacific War, Japan manages an invasion of Australia, leaving the Americans without a staging area in the Pacific (it is also suggested that the attack on Pearl Harbor was more successful, with the fleet being sunk in deep waters rather than in the shallow waters of the base). The Battle of Normandy still happens; however, the landing beaches have unfavorable terrain and the Germans' counterattack is successful. The failed invasion at Normandy not only prevented the Allies from opening a new front in the war, it also oversaw Germany's plans to invade Great Britain. With Rundstedt invading from the south and Rommel invading from the west, Operation Sea Lion proved to be a success, forcing the British to surrender.\n\nWhile Germany deals with partisan resistance, Japan invades India to crush the last of the British forces under the command of Wingate. With Great Britain defeated, Germany is able to turn its attention back to Stalin and the Soviet Union. Japanese advance units under General Kuribayashi and German Panzer divisions under Field Marshal Manstein surround Moscow, but the battle for control of the city turns into a three way brawl with German and Japanese units each vying for control of the city. The battle ends in a German victory. By now, the United States of America is the only Allied nation left to challenge the Axis. With the defeat of British and Australian forces, Japan quickly eliminates the last remaining ships of the American fleet and captures Midway, and later Hawaii. With American naval forces crippled beyond repair, the Allies lose their chances of defeating the Axis Powers and America settles into a new Cold War with Japan in the Pacific and Nazi Germany in Europe.\n\n\"Axis & Allies\" was developed by TimeGate Studios and built using the \"\" game engine, which laid out much of the framework for the game. \"Axis & Allies\" was released about a month later than \"\".\n\nThe people at TimeGate were \"very excited to [work] on [the] project with one of the leading publishers in the industry [Atari]\", as told by Adel Chaveleh, president of TimeGate Studios. He also said that \"[they] have been fans and players of the \"Axis & Allies\" franchise for years, and [their] commitment to innovation combined with the popularity of the brand is a definite recipe for a killer title.\"\n\nThe design process of \"Axis & Allies\" largely entailed three things: research, visual design, and game triggers.\n\nOne design task was choosing the missions for the Axis campaign. It was difficult to judge at what point the war should turn in favor of the Axis. It was decided that major changes had to start early in the war. If Rommel had not gotten sick or if Montgomery had never been placed in charge of the British forces in North Africa, the second Axis campaign mission, the Battle of El Alamein, might have been a disaster for the British. The Germans might have broken through and moved on to capture several of the major oil fields in the Middle East. If they had, then Operation Barbarossa might have been successful for Germany, since in the real course of history, German forces had to stop 30 miles from Moscow because some forces had to be diverted to fight for the Caucasus oil fields.\n\nMost of the designers at TimeGate working on the game were history buffs, and they watched World War II movies and documentaries at home for research. The Band of Brothers miniseries was popular with the team. Such research was used to size maps, create the appropriate number of cities, and to select which armies to be present. For example, the Normandy map was designed to be very large to accommodate all five beachheads: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, and Sword. The map was designed to accommodate all four Allied divisions that landed and the two Axis corps defending the coast.\n\nFor terrain design, the designer or artist working on the map would usually keep an atlas of the region by his desk for reference. The art team produced numerous terrain sets, such as the \"Russian winter\".\n\nThe designers used game triggers to make special game events occur. For example, early development of the Battle of the Bulge mission focused on the defense of Bastogne by the 101st Airborne Division. The map design started out as a city with several airborne companies inside it. Using triggers, German troops were pulled to attack the city many times. If the player could hold out long enough, Patton's third army arrived to break the encirclement.\n\nThe turn-based WWII mode in \"Axis & Allies\" was chiefly inspired by the \"Axis & Allies\" board game series. Although different in how it is played, the mode was said by lead designer Brian Wood to \"capture the importance of the economic factors (which are often left out of WWII games), as well as to encompass the global aspect of the board game.\"\n\n\"Axis & Allies\" performed satisfactory in ratings. The game was rated with a 6.0 by GameSpot, with gaming critics on the site giving a rating of 6.8 and users rating the game with 7.5. IGN rated the game with a score of 8.4, stating that \"\"Axis and Allies RTS\" stands on its own merits as a great strategy game.\"\n\nGamePlanet rated the game 4 out of 5 stars, marking the game as \"a marriage of the original board game and the recent award-winning RTS fantasy title \"Kohan II\"\", saying that the game \"has certainly taken on the best of both and delivered a great little game.\"\nXGPGaming tooted an 8.7/10 rating, saying that \"[they] did a great job on this game, in a genre that has been watered down by the numerous attempts by various companies [...] I recommend everyone who likes real-time strategy games to give this one a try.\" eToyChest gave a rating of 80%, writing that the game was \"worthy to carry the [\"Axis & Allies\"] name proudly, and is a tremendously entertaining game in its own right [...] \"Axis & Allies\" delivers in terms of pure excitement and plain and simple fun. The game packs in more than enough challenge to keep even the seasoned RTS veterans gritting their teeth, while the online component is sure to keep most any player giddy.\"\n\nGameSpy gave the game a low 2 out of 5 stars, detailing the game as, \"Timegate's goes to World War II and shoots itself in the foot.\" Tom Chick from GameSpy claimed that although the game \"does a good job of modeling supply lines\", he blames the game's incompetence on the \"interface [...] confusing and non-intuitive interplay among units [, and] too much base management.\" The game has also been criticized for its weak AI mechanics. However, the game was stated by its developers to be able to \"learn and adapt to player strategies as they play the game.\"\n\nIGN remarks that, artistically, the visuals of \"Axis & Allies\" look good:\n\nMusically, Butts says, \"The music and weapon effects are passable but don't stand out too much. Their chief virtue is in not getting in the way of the gameplay.\" Chris Stavros from GameWatcher thought the audio and video elements of the game were superb and portrayed the atmosphere of World War II very well:\n\nLarry Harris, the founder of the acclaimed \"Axis & Allies\" board game series, was proud to expand the \"Axis & Allies\" franchise into the realm of real-time strategy gaming:\n\n\"Axis & Allies\" is TimeGate's best-selling game release, upon the company's closure in 2013.\n\n\n"}

He was involved in the Plantation of Ulster in Ireland and the colonization of Maine in New England. Richmond's Island and Cape Richmond as well as Richmond, Maine (formerly Fort Richmond), are named after him. His magnificent monument with effigies survives in Westminster Abbey.\n\nHe was the eldest son of Esmé Stewart, 1st Duke of Lennox (1542-1583), a Frenchman of Scottish ancestry and a favourite of King James VI of Scotland I of England (of whose father Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley he was a first cousin), by his wife Catherine de Balsac (d.post-1630), a daughter of Guillaume de Balsac, Sieur d'Entragues, by his wife Louise d'Humières.\n\nOn 14 November 1583, after the death of his father, he returned from France and was taken to meet King James VI of Scotland at Kinneil House. Later in the month the Earl of Arran installed him in Holyrood Palace, expelling Francis, Earl of Bothwell from his lodgings.\n\nIn December the king issued instructions for Ludovic's education and placed him in the royal household under the care of Mr Gilbert Moncreiff. On 23 December 1583 he was appointed High and Great Chamberlain of Scotland and first Gentleman of the King's Bedchamber, as his father had been, with Alexander Erskine of Gogar, Captain of Edinburgh Castle as his deputy. The role included taking oaths of fidelity to the King from the other officers, ushers, and varlets of the Bedchamber and Wardrobe.\n\nOn 4 October 1590 he played cards with the king for stakes of a new \"black castor hat lined with velvet\". James however became angry with Lennox because he wished to marry Lilias (or Sophie) Ruthven, a daughter of William Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie. James wanted him to marry Arbella Stewart and had Lilias Ruthven shut up in Wemyss Castle. Despite this, Lennox rescued his bride from the castle and married her the next day. After 10 days the king's rage subsided and the couple were allowed to come to court. After the death of Lilias Ruthven in May 1592, the English diplomat Robert Bowes heard that the king often received Lennox in his bed when he was away from the court and his queen Anne of Denmark.\n\nRobert Bowes, the English diplomat in Edinburgh, described a fight on Edinburgh's Royal Mile between Lennox and John Wemyss of Logie. Logie had upset or made Lennox jealous in an incident in the king's bed chamber. Bowes said the offence was Logie's \"disobedience\" to the Duke. Lennox confronted Logie on the street on 7 January 1591 and hit him on the head with his sword. King James, who was walking behind Logie, was dragged into a shop for safety. Lennox was commanded to leave the court for a while, for fighting near the king's person. Some further details were recorded by David Calderwood. In his version Logie's offence was to refuse to leave the bedchamber at Lennox's command, Alexander Lord Home helped Lennox attack Logie, and the king's refuge was a skinner's shop where he \". Soon after, Lennox was returned to court by the queen's intercession.\n\nIn 1591 he was appointed to the post of Lord High Admiral of Scotland following the disgrace of Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell. On 13 February 1593 Lennox decided to play golf with Sir James Sandilands at Leith. On their way they met John Graham, a Lord of Session, who thought Sandilands was attacking him. The two groups of attendants fired on each other with pistols and John Graham and Sir Alexander Stewart, a companion of the duke, were killed.\n\nOn 6 May 1593 the Duke and 15 friends subscribed to a frivolous legal document swearing to abstain from wearing gold and silver trimmings on their clothes for a year, and defaulters were to pay for a banquet for all at John Killoch's house. This \"passement bond\" was in part inspired by cheap counterfeit gold and silver thread used in \"passements great or small, plain or \"à jour\", bissets, lilykins, cordons, and fringes\" which quickly discoloured. The signatories included; Lord Home, the Earl of Mar, Lord Spynie, the Master of Glamis, Sir Thomas Erskine, Walter Stewart of Blantyre, Sir George Home, and Sir William Keith of Delny. At the tournament at Prince Henry's baptism in August 1594 Lennox rode in a Turkish costume.\n\nHe was made the King's Lieutenant of the North, and took a force to the north of Scotland against the Earls of Huntly and Erroll. The castles of Ruthven in Badenoch and Inverness surrendered to him, and he held justice courts in Elgin. He ordered his sister the Countess of Huntly and the Countess of Erroll to go the court of James VI. On 10 February 1595 he came to Aberdeen, and was made a burgess of the town. Several members of his retinue were also made burgesses,including: Sir Robert Melville of Murdocairny, David Moysie secretary-depute to the king, and others.\n\nIn September 1596 James VI allowed Adam Bruntfield and James Carmichael to fight in single combat on Cramond Island because Bruntfield accused Carmichael of killing his brother in treasonous circumstances. Lennox went to the island to be the judge of their fight. Bruntfield killed Carmichael.\n\nFollowing his accession to the English throne in 1603, King James (now also known as James I of England) created him Lord Settrington and Earl of Richmond (1613), and Earl of Newcastle and Duke of Richmond (1623), all these titles being in the Peerage of England. \n\nLennox was a conduit for patronage and court appointments, and those hoping to place their allies at court would solicit his favour. However, Lennox claimed that placing more Scottish people in the king's household had become difficult. He wrote to Sir William Livingstone of Kilsyth who had asked for a place for a Napier of Merchiston Castle;\"although the King has this long time promised Merchiston ever the next vacant place, yet many has been placed over him and in this has found great impediments; for believe that a stranger shall find great difficulty to obtain any such place so long as there is any English man that does aim at it; for it is thought by them all that there is already too many Scots here in such places.\"\n\nIn July 1606 he was sent to Gravesend to welcome Christian IV of Denmark, the younger brother of the queen Anne of Denmark, to England. His companions included Sir Robert Gordon of Gordonstoun.\n\nLennox was in Scotland as High Commissioner of the Parliament from July 1607. His account of household expenses details his movements and the food he and his retainers consumed. He stayed at first at Holyrood Palace and his servant Walter Murray nailed his tapestries to the walls of his lodging. He also stayed in John Kinloch's house in Edinburgh. He spent time with Mary Ruthven, Countess of Atholl, a sister of his first wife, and gave her money. He visited St Andrews and was in Stirling with his daughter in November. His master cook William Murkie had worked for Anne of Denmark.\n\nOn 9 February 1608 he performed in the masque \"The Hue and Cry After Cupid\" at Whitehall Palace as a sign of the zodiac, to celebrate the wedding of John Ramsay, Viscount Haddington to Elizabeth Radclyffe.\n\nLennox acquired the licence to mint copper farthings. \n\nAs part of the Plantation of Ulster, in 1608 Lennox was granted lands at Portlough in the Barony of Raphoe in County Donegal. The Pynnar Survey of 1618 records Lennox as the chief undertaker for 2,000 acres in the Portlough area and as represented locally by his agent Sir Aulant Aula. Newtownstewart in County Tyrone, now in Northern Ireland, may have been named after him. In the Muster Rolls of 1631 his nephew and eventual heir James Stewart, 1st Duke of Richmond, 4th Duke of Lennox is described as being an undertaker of 4,000 acres. Mongavlin Castle was built by his son Sir John Stewart, who was also Governor of Dumbarton Castle.\n\nLudovic was involved in the colonization of Maine in New England. Richmond Island and Cape Richmond, as well as Richmond, Maine (formerly Fort Richmond), are named after him.\n\nIn March 1614 thieves broke into his lodgings at Whitehall Palace and stole a gold collar set with pearls and diamonds worth £300, a silver warming pan, a silver inkstand, and some linen.\n\nKing James VI of Scotland had discussed with Thomas Fowler the possibility of the Duke marrying Arbella Stuart, but the scheme was not proceeded with. He married twice:\n\nLennox also had a son with a mistress whose name is unknown:\n\nHe died in 1624 aged 49, without legitimate issue, and was buried in Westminster Abbey, in the \"Richmond Vault\" in the Henry VII Chapel (that king formerly having been Earl of Richmond) above which survives his magnificent black marble monument by Hubert Le Sueur with gilt-bronze recumbent effigies of himself and his wife. The Latin inscription may be translated as follows:\n\nThe Latin of the Biblical quotation (2.Samuel 3, 38: \"Know ye not that a prince and a great man is this day dead\") contains a chronogram forming the Roman numerals of 1623 (old style, 1624 new style), the year of his death.\n\nOn 6 October 1613 he was created Baron of Settrington (of Yorkshire) and Earl of Richmond (of Yorkshire), and on 17 May 1623 Earl of Newcastle-Upon-Tyne and Duke of Richmond.\n\nOn his death the title of Duke of Richmond became extinct, but the paternal Scottish title of Duke of Lennox passed to his younger brother, Esmé Stewart, 3rd Duke of Lennox (1579-1624).\n\n"}

It was a nonsectarian advocacy group which sought to monitor mass media for content that it deemed is harmful to children and families. The group characterized itself as \"an international resource center for cutting-edge research and information\" and denied playing any role in media censorship.\n\nThe MediaWise movement is the publicity and community outreach arm of the NIMF. Through it the organization sponsors speaking engagements given by its staff throughout the country, although most events take place at educational and religious institutions in the state of Minnesota. David Walsh is notable as the spokesperson for the NIMF, having given numerous interviews to national news programs and newspapers in this capacity.\n\nThe primary publication of the MediaWise movement is an annual report on the marketing, distribution, and impact of video games to minors. This \"Video Game Report Card\" comprises results to national surveys, summaries of recently completed research projects, and a grade-based assessment of the Entertainment Software Association's efforts to regulate the sales of video games to minors.\n\nThe 2005 MediaWise Video Game Report Card criticized the Entertainment Software Rating Board's system of rating video games for age-appropriate conduct in its annual series of report cards, noting the scarcity of \"Adults-Only\" rated games and citing the perceived inadequacy in retailer enforcement. Several days after the report was released, the United States National Parent Teacher Association issued a press release condemning it, stating that \"[the report card] contained erroneous statements about National PTA's position on the Entertainment Software Rating Board's (ESRB) rating system. In fact, National PTA does not endorse NIMF's report. Further, it does not agree with the report's characterization of ESRB and its rating system.\"\n\nIn 2005 the NIMF made the controversial claim that the video game industry was promoting cannibalism after analyzing stills and video clips from a zombie-themed game titled \"Stubbs the Zombie in Rebel Without a Pulse\". Dr. Walsh was asked about this in a podcast interview with Dennis McCauley, owner of gamepolitics.com. During the interview Dr. Walsh did not acknowledge the NIMF's apparent error, instead claiming that video gamers tricked him into thinking there was cannibalism in the game.\n\nIn late 2003 Walsh proposed the coining of a neologism to fill what he sees is a gap in English vocabulary: \"killographic\", to be defined as the \"graphic depiction of brutal violence.\" This is intended as an analogy to \"pornographic\", which he defines as the \"graphic depiction of sexual acts\". This term has been the subject of considerable public debate. Doug Lowenstein, head of the Entertainment Software Association, described it as a \"clever phrase\", but noted that the average age of video gamers is 28, and that \"as adults they should be allowed to pick their entertainment.\"\n\nOn December 6, 2005, The ESRB assigned a failing grade of \"F\" to NIMF for its seriously flawed Video Game Report Card released the previous week. The ESRB cited inaccuracies, incomplete and misleading statements, omission of material facts, and flawed research as key factors in assigning the failing grade. In addition to the overall failing grade, NIMF was given a demerit for elevating its political and media agenda over their stated concerns for consumer welfare, particularly those of children and teenagers.\n\n"}

{"id": "2295773", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2295773", "title": "Golden apple", "text": "Golden apple\n\nThe golden apple is an element that appears in various national and ethnic folk legends or fairy tales. Recurring themes depict a hero (for example Hercules or Făt-Frumos) retrieving the golden apples hidden or stolen by a monstrous antagonist. Alternatively, as part of the mysterious apple branch of Otherworld in Irish mythology.\n\nThree instances of golden apples were featured in Greek mythology:\n\nThe first case concerns a huntress named Atalanta who raced against a suitor named Melanion. Melanion used golden apples to distract Atalanta so that he could win the race.\n\nThough abandoned by her father as an infant, Atalanta became a skilled hunter and received acclaim for her role in the hunt for the Calydonian boar. Her father claimed her as his daughter and wished to marry her off. However, Atalanta was reluctant to marry due to a prophecy that marriage would be her downfall. Because of her beauty, she gained a number of suitors and finally agreed to marry, but under the condition that her suitor was obligated to beat her in a footrace. Competitors who failed to beat her would be put to death. As Atalanta could run extremely fast, all her suitors died. Realizing that Atalanta could not be defeated in a fair race, Melanion prayed to Aphrodite for help. The goddess gave him three golden apples and told him to drop them one at a time to distract Atalanta. Sure enough, she quit running long enough to retrieve each golden apple. It took all three apples and all of his speed, but Melanion finally succeeded, winning the race and Atalanta's hand.\n\nEventually they had a son Parthenopaios, who was one of the Seven against Thebes. Their marriage ended in misfortune when they were transformed into lions (which the Greeks believed were unable to mate with their own species, only with leopards) for offending the gods.\n\nZeus held a banquet in celebration of the marriage of Peleus and Thetis. Eris, the goddess of discord, was not invited for her troublesome nature, and upon turning up uninvited, she threw a golden apple into the ceremony, with an inscription that read: \"ΤΗΙ ΚΑΛΛΙΣΤΗΙ\" (, Modern Greek: τη καλλίστη \"ti kallisti\"; \"for/to the most beautiful\" – cf. Callisto). Three goddesses claimed the apple: Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite. They brought the matter before Zeus. Not wanting to get involved, Zeus assigned the task to Paris of Troy. Paris had demonstrated his exemplary fairness previously when he awarded a prize unhesitatingly to Ares after the god, in bull form, had bested his own prize bull.\nZeus gave the apple to Hermes and told him to deliver it to Paris and tell him that the goddesses would accept his decision without argument. As each goddess wanted to receive the apple, they each stripped off their own clothing and appeared naked before Paris. Each of the goddesses also offered Paris a gift as a bribe in return for the apple; Hera offered to make him the king of Europe and Asia Minor, Athena offered him wisdom and skill in battle, and Aphrodite offered to give to him the love of the world's most beautiful woman, Helen of Sparta, who was already married to King Menelaus. Paris chose Aphrodite, a decision that caused the Trojan war, and ultimately the destruction of both Paris and his city, Troy.\n\nHera’s sacred golden apple tree is an apple tree that grows apples made entirely of gold. Zeus gave it to her as a gift. The dragon Ladon was sent to guard it from anyone who might try to steal the apples. \n\nThe role of the Golden Apple is far more minor and less specific in Irish lore, mostly because it is an element of the Silver Branch, or \"Silver Bough\", symbol that is connected to the Celtic Otherworld.\n\nThe silver branch with golden apples is owned Irish sea deity and Otherworld guardian Manannán mac Lir in the tale \"Echtra Cormaic\". But these \"apples\" are actually \"balls of red gold\" hanging on a musical branch according to variant texts, and hardly fruits at all. The Dictionary of the Irish Language concurs, by defining the \"apples\" in this instance as \"musical balls\", not \"fruits\".\n\nThere has been offered for comparison \"silver branch of the sacred apple-tree bearing blossoms\" encountered by Bran mac Febail in the narrative \"The Voyage of Bran\", though golden apple fruits are not evident in this telling. This branch came from \"Emain\", construed to mean Emain Ablach associated with Manannán mac Lir by later commentators, though not recognized as anything other than Emain Macha of the Ulstermen in Eleanor Hull's monograph on the silver branch.\n\nIn the \"Oidheadh Chloinne Tuireann\" version of the quest of Tuirenn's sons (Brian, Iuchar and Iucharba), the éric items demanded by Lugh Lamhfada included the Golden Apples of Hesperides. It is said to taste of honey, have curative powers, and not diminish though they are eaten. They could also be cast and perform tasks at will, and return to their owners.\n\nIn Richard Wagner's \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\", the golden apples have their own leitmotif. It is first sung by Fafner, when he explains to his brother Fasolt why they must take Freia away from the gods.\n\nIn Stravinsky's ballet The Firebird (1910) which is based upon an amalgam of Russian folk-legends, the hero Prince Ivan enters a garden where he witnesses 13 young Princesses' playing with Golden Apples which grow there. (Tableaux VII Scherzo. Jeux des princesses avec les pommes d'or / The Princesses' Game with the Golden Apples).\n\nMany European fairy tales begin when golden apples are stolen from a king, usually by a bird:\n\nThe William Butler Yeats poem \"The Song of the Wandering Aengus\", has the lines:\n\nThe Augusta, Lady Gregory play called \"The Golden Apple: A Play for Kiltartan Children\" is a fable in the invented Kiltartan dialect based on Irish mythology and folklore.\n\n\"The Golden Apples\" is the name of Southern writer, Eudora Welty's, fourth short story collection, published in 1949. The stories are interrelated and center around the citizens of the fictional town of Morgana, Mississippi.\n\nA golden apple plays a crucial role in the climax of David Mitchell's sixth novel \"The Bone Clocks\", published by Random House in 2014.\n\nThe contemporary religion Discordianism draws upon the Golden Apple of the goddess Eris, also known as the \"Apple of Discord\", which Eris used to set off the conflict among the goddesses of Olympus that lead to the Trojan War because she was not invited to a party (the so-called \"Original Snub\". Emblazoned upon the apple is the word \"\"Kallisti\"\" (\"to the fairest\"). The golden apple can be seen as a metaphor for a practical joke meant to cause cognitive dissonance in the target.\n\nMichael Hübner has suggested that the fruit of the Argan tree, endemic to the Sous Valley in present-day Morocco, may be the golden apples of the Hesperides. Arguing that the location matches most closely the description given in classical texts of Atlantis and the garden of the Hesperides, he notes that the ripe fruits look like small golden apples and have an aroma like baked apples. He equates the fruit, the seeds of which produce Argan oil, with Plato's account of Atlantean fruits \"which afford liquid and solid food and unguents\", and proposes that the trees' almost reptilian-scale like bark and thorns may have inspired the mythical guardian dragon of the golden apples, Ladon.\n\nIn many languages, the orange is referred to as a \"golden apple\". For example, the Greek \"χρυσομηλιά,\" and Latin \"pomum aurantium\" both literally describe oranges as \"golden apples\". Other languages, like German, Finnish, Hebrew, and Russian, have more complex etymologies for the word \"orange\" that can be traced back to the same idea.\n\nIn later years it was thought that the \"golden apples\" of myth might have actually been oranges, a fruit unknown to Europe and the Mediterranean before the Middle Ages. Under this assumption, the Greek botanical name chosen for all citrus species was \"Hesperidoeidē\" (Ἑσπεριδοειδῆ, \"hesperidoids\"). It was also used by Carl Linnaeus, who gave the name Hesperides to an order containing the genus Citrus, in allusion to the golden apples of the Hesperides, and is preserved in the term Hesperidium for the fruits of citrus and some other plants.\n\nOne reason why oranges might be considered to be \"magical\" in so many stories is because they bear flowers and fruit at the same time, unlike other fruit.\n\nFrequently , the term \"golden apple\" is used to refer to the quince, a fruit originating in the Middle East.\n\nThe tomato, unknown to the ancient world of the Greeks, is known as the \"pomodoro\" in Italian, meaning \"golden apple\" (from \"pomo d'oro\").\n\nGolden apples are also items that are featured in video games such as \"Minecraft\" and \"Hello Neighbor\". In the TV-series \"Animated Tales of the World\", the episode \"The Tree with the Golden Apples\" revolves around the golden apple-tree on an island. An old man asks three brothers to sail to the island and whoever brings him a golden apple gets his daughter's hand in marriage.\n\n\n"}

Till the beginning of the 19th century he was known only from the notice of him in the \"Chronicle\" (year 443) of his contemporary Hydatius, where he is praised as a poet and orator, and mention is made of statues set up in his honour.\n\nIn 1813 the base of a statue was discovered at Rome, with a long inscription belonging to the year 435 (CIL vi. 1724) upon Flavius Merobaudes, celebrating his merits as warrior and poet. Ten years later, B. G. Niebuhr discovered some Latin verses on a palimpsest in the monastery of St Gall, the authorship of which was traced to Merobaudes, owing to the great similarity of the language in the prose preface to that of the inscription.\n\nFormerly the only piece known under the name of Merobaudes was a short poem (30 hexameters) \"De Christo\", attributed to him by one manuscript, to Claudian by another; but Ebert is inclined to dispute the claim of Merobaudes to be considered either the author of the \"De Christo\" or a Christian.\n\nThe Panegyric and minor poems have been edited by Niebuhr (1824); by Immanuel Bekker in the Bonn Corpus scriptorum hist.

Fuld is seen as the father of the Ouija board. Though Fuld never claimed to have invented the Ouija board, intense media coverage in the 1930s credited him with it. The misinformation was sustained by his own marketing, and his practice of stamping \"Original Ouija Board\" and \"Inventor\" on the back of his boards. By the end of his life he would have over 33 patents, trademarks, and copyrights credited to him.\n\nWilliam Fuld was one of ten children. By the age of 26, he was working as a customs inspector in his hometown of Baltimore. Fuld also worked as a varnisher which led to his job as foreman at the Kennard Novelty Co. which was founded on October 30, 1890, the same year that Elijah Bond filed the first patent for a talking board. This patent was assigned to William H. A. Maupin and Charles W. Kennard.\n\nFor reasons unknown Kennard was removed from his company in 1891. By 1892 Fuld had taken over as supervisor and the company changed its name to The Ouija Novelty Company and moved into a new location. William Fuld filed for his first talking board patent in the same year. Under the direction of Fuld, the company increased production of Ouija boards to meet the growing demand and thwarted many of Kennard's attempts to manufacture other talking boards.\n\nIn 1898, William and his brother Isaac went into business together under the name Isaac Fuld & Brother, leasing the \"Ouija\" name from The Ouija Novelty Company. In addition to talking boards, the brothers also manufactured pool tables and other billiards accessories. William was the first person to file a trademark for the term \"Return Pool\" table.\n\nBy 1901, the brothers' partnership had ended in a bitter feud. William Fuld changed the name of his company to the William Fuld Manufacturing Company. Going against an injunction, Isaac continued to manufacture talking boards under the name \"Oriole\" that were exact replicas of the boards that he and his brother had made. William sued his brother in a case that remained open until 1919.\n\nWilliam Fuld’s first talking board trademark, \"Oracle\", was filed in 1902. A crafty businessman, Fuld sued companies whose talking boards infringed on his trademarks or patents. It cannot be said whether or not he actually took himself seriously. However his numerous publicity stunts made the talking board a very successful product for Fuld, claiming in 1920 that the Ouija board had made him more than $1 million in profit.\n\nIn order to combat the growing competition for other talking board manufacturers, Fuld knew that if he himself made a cheaper version of his own product he would get more business. In 1919, he introduced the \"Mystifying Oracle\", an exact replica of his Ouija board that sold for less money. He also launched a line of trademarked Ouija jewelry and Ouija Oil for rheumatism. Fuld also trademarked the names \"Egyptian Luck board\", \"Hindu Luck board\" and \"WE-JA\" as well as a trademark detailing the way the word \"Ouija\" would be displayed.\n\nWilliam Fuld became a member of the Baltimore General Assembly in 1924. On February 24, 1927, Fuld climbed to the roof of his three-story factory to supervise the installation of a flagpole. When the rail against which he was leaning gave way, Fuld fell to the ground below. While being transported, a fractured rib pierced his heart and William Fuld died at the hospital.\n\nAfter his death, Fuld's children took over the company. Catherine and William A. Fuld ran the company until the youngest brother, Hubert, became president of William Fuld Inc. in 1942. Parker Brothers acquired the company and all of its assets in 1966.\n\n"}

The other was \"Koronis Rift\". Both took advantage of the fractal technology developed for \"Rescue on Fractalus!\", further enhancing it. In \"The Eidolon\", \"Rescue\"'s fractal mountains were turned upside down and became the inside of a cave.\n\nIn addition to common cassette formats, the Atari and Commodore 64 versions were supplied on a flippy disk. One side had the Atari version, and the other had the Commodore 64 version. The Atari version required an XL/XE with 64kB or more memory.\n\nThe player discovers the Eidolon, a strange 19th-century vehicle, in an abandoned laboratory. As the player investigates this device, he is accidentally transported to another dimension and is trapped in a vast, maze-like cave. The creatures in this cave, sensing the energy emanating from the Eidolon, are woken from a long slumber, and the player soon finds that his only chance of survival lies in this mysterious vehicle and its powerful energy weapon.\n\nThe objective of \"The Eidolon\" is to successfully navigate through all of the game's levels, defeating the dragon guardian at the end of each level. The player navigates through each maze and collects energy orbs, which come in four different colors (red, yellow, green and blue). Along the way, various enemies wake up and attack the Eidolon, attempting to absorb its energy. Some enemies also fire orbs at the Eidolon, of which all but the red orbs can be absorbed by pressing the space bar at the right time to replenish the Eidolon's limited energy.\n\nGreen orbs also have the power to transform other enemies into different kinds of enemies. Blue orbs can freeze enemies temporarily, giving the player a momentary advantage in a fight.\n\nEach level contains three diamonds, each guarded by an enemy of a specific color. After defeating each of these enemies and collecting the diamonds, the player can proceed to the dragon that guards the exit. There are eight levels in a game. The game is over when the player has successfully defeated the final dragon or runs out of time.\n\n\"Zzap!64\" gave the game a Gold Medal award, with an overall 97% score. The summary of the reviews from their three reviewers was \"Lucasfilm's most original release yet, containing outstanding graphics and gameplay elements. The Eidolon is both immaculate in conception and execution. Not to be missed.\"\n\nGregg Williams of \"Computer Gaming World\" disliked \"The Eidolon\". He stated that it was as difficult as \"Koronis Rift\" but with no save game feature. While praising the graphics and sound, Ardai criticized the game for \"a lack of imagination. You get transported to god-knows-where ... and you basically shoot everything in sight. Is this a reasonable—let alone responsible—way to explore a new world?\" Charles Ardai later described the game in the magazine as \"one of the worst\" of 1986.\n\nThe game was positively reviewed in a retrospective article in Retro Gamer magazine. It was praised for being \"wonderfully atmospheric\" due to the technical achievement of the fractally created environment. It was also considered to be the most ambitious and original release of the 3 Lucasfilm games which used fractal routines. Overall it was described as \"a fascinating snapshot of gaming history that showed how innovative, immersive and tense a first-person style arcade-adventure could be on 8-bit platforms.\n\n"}

He was a grandson of Esmé Stewart, 3rd Duke of Lennox.\n\nOn 10 December 1645 he was created Baron Stuart of Newbury, Berkshire, and Earl of Lichfield, titles conferred on him \"to perpetuate the titles which were intended to have been conferred on his uncle\" Lord Bernard Stewart, youngest son of the Duke of Lennox, who had been killed in the Battle of Rowton Heath in the English Civil War in September of that year.\n\nIn January 1658, Charles Stewart went into exile in France, and took up his residence in the house of his uncle, Ludovic Stewart, seigneur d'Aubigny. In the following year he fell under the displeasure of The Protectorate's Council of State, and warrants were issued for seizing his person and goods.\n\nHe returned to England with King Charles II in 1660, on the Restoration of the Monarchy and sat in the Convention Parliament, showing great animosity towards the supporters of the Commonwealth. On the death of his 10-year-old cousin Esmé Stewart on 10 August 1660, He succeeded as 3rd Duke of Richmond and 6th Duke of Lennox. In that same year he was created Hereditary Great Chamberlain of Scotland, Hereditary Great Admiral of Scotland, and Lord-Lieutenant of Dorset. On 15 April 1661 he was invested with the Order of the Garter.\n\nCirca 1660 he built Richmond House on the site of the bowling green of Henry VIII's Palace of White Hall.\n\nOn the death of his uncle, Ludovic Stuart, he succeeded him as 12th Seigneur D'Aubigny, for which title he did homage by proxy to King Louis XIV of France on 11 May 1670. In July 1667, on the death of his cousin, Mary Butler, countess of Arran, he became Baron Clifton, and on 4 May 1668 he was made Lord Lieutenant and Vice Admiral of Kent, jointly with the Earl of Winchilsea.\n\nCharles Stewart married thrice, but had no issue:\n\nIn 1671 he was sent as ambassador to the Danish court to persuade Denmark to join England and France in a projected attack on the Dutch. Whilst there at Elsinore in 1672 he died by drowning, aged 33\nand was buried on 20 September 1673 in Westminster Abbey. As he died without issue his titles became extinct, with the exception of that of Baron Clifton, which passed with most of his property to his sister Katherine, Lady O'Brien. His wife, however, had been granted the Lennox estates for life. In 1675 the titles Duke of Richmond, Duke of Lennox and Earl of March, were resurrected for Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond and Lennox, the illegitimate son of King Charles II by his mistress Louise de Kérouaille.\n\n\n\n"}

In the following clash with security forces on 9 October 1967 he and two other members of insurgent forces were killed, five captured, others fleeing.\n\nChisiza was born in the Karonga district of northern Malawi (then Nyasaland) in 1926, to Kaluli Chisiza, a Group Village Headman. He was educated at Uliwa Junior Primary School and at the mission school at Livingstonia. He subsequently worked as an Assistant Inspector of Police in Tanzania (then Tanganyika) and returned to Malawi in 1958. For a short time he, together with his brother Dunduzu Chisiza, attempted to go in business operating a butcher's shop in Blantyre market, but this venture soon failed.\n\nAfter the historic Nyasaland African Congress convention in January 1959, he was appointed as bodyguard to Hastings Kamuzu Banda, who later became the first premier of Malawi. He was arrested along with hundreds of others (including his brother) in the dawn raids of Operation Sunrise on 3 March 1959, when the colonial administration declared a state of emergency in Nyasaland. In 1960 he was named as Secretary General of the MCP under Banda's presidency. He was imprisoned in Khami Prison near Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia. He was released, some months after Banda, in September 1960.\n\nAfter the death of his brother, Dunduzu Chisiza, in September 1962, Yatuta was elected to the Legislative Council for Karonga district and Banda appointed him Minister of Home Affairs.\n\nNot long after Malawi had gained independence from Great Britain in July 1964, he was one of several cabinet ministers who, chafing under an increasingly autocratic leadership, were ousted by Banda in the Cabinet Crisis of 1964. He fled the country and, allegedly after undergoing military training in China, later conducted guerilla operations against the Banda regime from Tanzania. Here, Chisiza founded the Socialist League of Malawi (LESOMA), the most radical Malawian party in opposition to the Banda regime. Chisiza was succeeded by Attati Mpakati. Another exiled Malawian and important member of LESOMA was Mahoma M. Mwaungulu.\n\nIn 1964 Paul Theroux, an outspoken, American, Peace Corps Volunteer in Nyasaland, was declared persona non grata by Dr. Hastings Banda for supporting Yatuta, who was accused of attempting to overthrow the government. Theroux delivered a letter from an exiled opposition leader, David Rubadiri, to Chisiza in Tanzania. He also carried a coded messages from Chisiza to a \"Greek fellow\" in Blantyre. According to an account by Theroux in Esquire Magazine, when Theroux delivered the message on October 16 to the Greek baker, who was en route to delivering his bread to Ntcheu, \nthe baker \"trembled and went pale\".\" : guessed the Greek baker had been caught, interrogated by the Malawi Criminal Investigation Department about bread van\", and exposed Yatutas whearabouts and Theroux's involvement. Banda told the American ambassador that he had proof Theroux was plotting to kill him, and demanded the volunteer be sent home. He found out later that in his final day, instead of finding bread waiting in a van, Chisiza found Malawi soldiers, who ambushed and killed the revolutionary gunman from Tanzania where he was plotting against Banda. Paul Theroux was thrown out of the Peace Corp for his role in Malawi and is now a renowned novelist.\n\nChisiza was killed by a single shot to the head in October 1967, apparently by Malawian security forces, although rumours have attributed a role to security forces of the Ian Smith regime in Southern Rhodesia. His body was put on display at the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital near Blantyre as a warning to other potential insurgents.\n\nHe was survived by two sons, Vyande Yatuta Chisiza and Kwacha Chisiza, and grandchildren: Millie, Bakalele, Mphikwa, Matebe, Mutale, Lusayo, Atupele, Mbakaya and Chikosa. He is the brother of Dunduzu Chisiza, and uncle to Du Chisiza Jnr.\n"}

One of the aircraft he piloted in 1942 was Spitfire Mk. Vb, \"BM597\", now flying with the Historic Aircraft Collection at Duxford.\n\nWyrożemski later flew the North American Mustang Mk. IIIs when No.315 Squadron converted in March 1944.\n\nHe scored no kills but was awarded the Polish Cross of Valour (Krzyz Walecznych) plus bar.\n\nWyrożemski was a Polish Army officer when the Germans invaded Poland in September 1939. Wyrożemski served with 217 \"Eskadra Bombowa\" equipped with PZL.37 Łoś twin-engine bombers as an observer before he fled the German advance. He made his way to Istanbul where he signed onto a freighter bound for England and reported to the Polish Embassy in London.\n\nRichard L. Holm, former CIA Directorate of Operations member, stated in an article about his African experiences that Wyrożemski was \"fiercely loyal to Poland, [and] he wanted to fight against the Germans. Wyrożemski claimed he had been a pilot in the Polish Air Force, and he apparently had flown a small plane in his youth. He joined other Poles and flew a Spitfire in the Battle of Britain.\"\n\nWyrożemski's serial number was RAF P-O779, with rank of F/Lt & Captain in Polish. He served with the 315th Polish Fighter Squadron in Great Britain from April 1942 until the end of WW II.\n\nOn 25 April 1945 Wyrożemski participated in the longest (five hours, fifty minutes) and last mission flown in World War II by fighters of the Polish Air Force. He flew as part of some 240 Mustangs from RAF 11 Group and the USAAF VIII Fighter Command, escorting 225 Avro Lancaster bombers on a Ramrod mission to hit Nazi headquarters in the Bavarian Alps.\n\nSome pilots landed in liberated territory on the European continent to refuel on the return leg of the mission while others calculated their loads sufficient to reach their bases in England. Wyrożemski fell one kilometer short of Andrews Airfield and dead-sticked his Mustang into a pasture where several horses slowed his fighter sufficiently such that he was not injured. The livestock were not so fortunate. Fellow squadron mate Tadeusz Pinkowski, recounted \"Seeing him approaching the airfield and then going down, we climbed [into] (sic) a jeep and sped toward him. We found him O.K. Those two horses were O.K. not! Leaving the scene we even joked a little; somebody pointed to the horse liver lying around and asked: 'Say, Ksawery. Didn't you forget something?' We all had a good laugh and that helped to release the tension.\"\n\nWyrozemski and his wife Emilia Ann, known as \"Lila\", (a Warsaw native who had survived a German concentration camp after arrest for partisan involvement), emigrated to the United States from the United Kingdom with their three-year-old young son, Ksawery M. R. Wyrozemski (Father of three boys; Alexander, Christopher and Frederik Wyrozemski) in 1959 and settled in Fort Walton Beach, Florida,[4] home of Eglin Air Force Base and the Air Proving Ground Center. Wyrozemski was employed by the Central Intelligence Agency where he was ostensibly involved with the Lockheed U-2 program as a Lockheed \"employee\".\n\nMore likely, he was one of the contract pilots operating C-54 Skymaster flights out of Eglin AFB, probably out of Duke Field, for the Development Projects Division, the Agency's air arm, in support of Operation Pluto, the ill-fated Bay of Pigs Invasion, in 1960-1961. A temporary C-54 unit, the 1045th Operational Evaluation and Training Group, Headquarters Command, Eglin AFB, as the Air Force designated it, but which was a DPD operation, was temporarily based at Eglin's Auxiliary Field Three (Duke Field) from late 1960 to June/July 1961. “There was a total of about 20 Polish airmen at Eglin at the time, all of them 'employed' by Lockheed, so there should be enough of them to form at least two crews.” The DPD operated independently of \"the organizational structure of the project, in which it had a vital, central role, including air drops to the underground, training Cuban pilots, operation of air bases, the immense logistical problems of transporting the Cuban volunteers from Florida to Guatemala, and the procuring and servicing of the military planes.\"\n\n\"After 18 years as a contract officer in Agency air operations, Bill's eyesight weakened and he could no longer fly. There was a need for air ops officers on the ground in the Congo, however, and soon he was in Africa,\" said Holm. In 1964 he served as an airfield commander and trained Cuban exile pilots, hired by the CIA. He also gathered intelligence material. Holm continues that \"Big Bill\" was transferred to Albertville on the Congo's eastern border [in 1965]. \"Shortly after his arrival, he was concerned about a possible rebel force moving toward Albertville from the west, and Bill got approval from Leopoldville to make a short reconnaissance of the area. He had been instructed not to go alone, but no one else was readily available.\" Returning to Albertville, he was killed when the Land Rover he was in was hit head-on by a Congolese Army truck speeding on the wrong side of a narrow road. He was 51. A local \"Playground Daily News\" account of his death stated that \"Mr. Wyrozemski was a civil service employee with the United States Army.\" It also stated that \"no details are available on the accident in which he lost his life.\" He is buried in Fort Walton Beach. \n\nOn 28 May 2016, Wyrożemski was recognized with a star at the Langley headquarters of the CIA as an employee who lost his life while in the service of the agency.\n"}

Regarded as one of the most important figures of medieval Bulgaria, Euthymius was the last head of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church in the Second Bulgarian Empire. Arguably the best esteemed of all Bulgarian patriarchs, Euthymius was a supporter of hesychasm and an authoritative figure in the Eastern Orthodox world of the time.\n\nBorn around 1325 (between 1320–1330) and possibly an offspring of the eminent Tsamblak family of the capital Tarnovo, Euthymius was educated at the monastery schools in and around the city and became a monk. He joined the Kilifarevo Monastery around 1350, attracted by the fame of Theodosius of Tarnovo. Theodosius appointed him his first assistant in 1363 and the two went together to Tsarigrad, with Theodosius dying soon afterwards.\n\nEuthymius then consecutively joined the Studion monastery and the Great Lavra of Athanasius the Athonite on Mount Athos. He was influenced by outstanding scholars and reformers of Southeastern Europe's spiritual life, such as Gregory the Sinaite, Gregory Palamas, Callistus Philotheus and John Kukuzelis. He was sent into exile on the island of Lemnos by Byzantine Emperor John V Palaiologos and, upon his release, returned to the Bulgarian Zograf Monastery on Mount Athos. It was there that he first reflected on the spelling reforms and planned corrections to the translations of the clerical books.\n\nAround 1371 Euthymius returned to Bulgaria and founded the Holy Trinity Patriarchal Monastery near Tarnovo, where he grounded the Tarnovo Literary School. He established orthographic rules and corrected inaccurately translated religious books by comparing them to the Greek originals. These corrected texts became models for the Orthodox churches using Church Slavonic language: Bulgaria, Serbia, Romania, and Ukraine. Gregory Tsamblak, his biographer, compared Euthymius' work to that of Moses and Egyptian king Ptolemy I.\n\nIn 1375, following the death of Patriarch Joanicius, Euthymius was elected to become his successor. A supporter of asceticism, Euthymius aimed to persecute heresies and moral decay. Euthymius became a prominent figure in the Orthodox world and a number of metropolitans and hegumens addressed him to interpret theological matters.\n\nThere are 15 known works by Euthymius, including liturgical books, laudatory works, passionals and epistles. Among his literary disciples are Gregory Tsamblak, Metropolitan of Kiev; Cyprian, Metropolitan of Moscow; Joasaph of Bdin and Constantine of Kostenets.\n\nDuring the time of patriarch Theodosius of Tarnovo Euthymius founded and ran the Tarnovo literary school, which was to quickly become an important cultural center of the Slavic Christian world.\nEuthymius initiated a language reform in Old Bulgarian that was widely influential to the standardized literary languages of Serbia, Walachia, Moldova, and the Ukrainian principalities.\n\nPartial list of works:\n\nHagiographies\n\n“Hagiography of St. Ivan of Rila”\n\n“Hagiography of St. Ilarion Maglenski”\n\n“Hagiography of St. Philothea Temnishka”\n\n“Hagiography of St. Petka of Tarnovo”\n\nPraises\n\n“Praise for Mikhail Warrior”\n\n“Praise for Ioan Polivotski”\n\n“Praise for St. Nedelya”\n\n“Praise for St. Constantine and Helena”\n\nLetters\n\n“Letter to Cyprian\"\n\n“Letter to metropolitan Arsenius”\n\n“Letter to Nikodim – monk of Tismana”\n\nIn the spring of 1393 the son of Ottoman Sultan Bayezid I, Suleyman Çelebi, laid siege to the Bulgarian capital Tarnovo with his sizable forces. With Tsar Ivan Shishman out of the city (leading the remnants of his troops to the fortress of Nikopol), Euthymius was the one entrusted with the defense of Tarnovo. After a three-month siege on 17 July 1393, the Ottomans captured the capital despite its ferocious resistance; Gregory Tsamblak several years later suggested the conquest was due to treason from one of the non-Christian neighborhoods of Tarnovo.\n\nJoasaph of Bdin, Metropolitan of Vidin, a contemporary of the event, described it as follows: \"A great Muslim invasion happened and total destruction was done with this city and its surroundings.\" According to Gregory Tsamblak, churches were turned into mosques, priests were expelled and substituted with \"teachers of shamelessness.\" 110 noted citizens of Tarnovo and boyars were massacred, but Patriarch Euthymius was reprieved and sent into exile in the theme of Macedonia (contemporary Thrace), possibly in the Bachkovo Monastery. He is supposed to have died there in 1402–1404. The Tarnovo Patriarchate thereupon ceased to exist as the Bulgarian church lost its independence and became subordinate to the Patriarchate of Constantinople until 1870.\n\nPatriarch Euthymius has been canonized and his memory is honored on the same day as that of his namesake Euthymius the Great, 20 January.\n\nSt. Evtimiy Crag on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Patriarch Euthymius of Bulgaria.\n\n\n"}

A Test match is an international two-innings per side cricket match between two of the leading cricketing nations. The list is arranged in the order in which each player won his Test cap by playing for the England cricket team. Where more than one player won his first Test cap in the same Test match, those players are listed alphabetically by surname. In the text, the numbers that follow the players' names correspond to their place in the chronological list of English Test cricketers. Current players have their chronological number on the front of their shirts.\n\nStatistics are correct as of the end of England's Test series in South Africa (27 January 2020).\n\nThe early years of Test cricket saw a number of tours to Australia. Most of these tours were professional in nature, and as the sea voyage was around 42 days and the tours lasted many months, the sides were selected as much on availability as on cricketing aptitude. As a result of this, coupled with there only being a small number of Tests being played, there are many early cricketers with Test records of only a few matches. The key players who had their Test debut during this period include the great professional all-rounders George Ulyett (11), who played 25 Tests, and Billy Barnes (21), who played 21. England's Champion cricketer WG Grace (24) first played Test cricket in 1880. Although Test match cricket had not been invented in his heyday of the late 1860s and 1870s, he continued playing into his fifties, finally retiring from Test cricket at the turn of the century. Shrewsbury (35) and Stoddart (56) go down amongst the great captains of the period, as well as two of the many cricketing suicides. Johnny Briggs (47), who, bedevilled by mental illness, died young, notched up the most Test caps of the earliest era of Test match cricket.\n\nThe period between 1890 and immediately before the First World War is known as the golden age of cricket. It saw great amateur players such as CB Fry (95), the Indian Prince Ranjitsinhji (105) and captains Stanley Jackson (82), Archie MacLaren (92) and Plum Warner (118) as the leading lights in an era eulogised by Neville Cardus and others. In reality, it was not quite the great age of the amateur related in Cardus's writings. Sydney Barnes (129) became the best paid cricketer by spurning county cricket to play in the Lancashire leagues. However, the sheer volume of greats, that include Jack Hobbs (157), Tom Hayward (97), Gilbert Jessop (122) and Wilfred Rhodes (121) means that the age retains a fond place in the memory of England's cricket fans. It was also an era in which Bernard Bosanquet (137) invented the googly and Tip Foster (138) became the only man to captain England at both cricket and football, and Rhodes, at 30 years, 10 months and 11 days, had the longest spanning Test career of all.\n\nSince the 2019 Ashes series, there has been an introduction of names and numbers on all Test players' shirts in an effort to engage new fans and help identify the players. This forms part of the inaugural ICC World Test Championship, a league competition between the top nine Test nations spread over a two-year period, culminating in a Final between the top two teams.\n"}
{"id": "2295876", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2295876", "title": "Gular skin", "text": "Gular skin\n\nGular skin (throat skin), in ornithology, is an area of featherless skin on birds that joins the lower mandible of the beak (or \"bill\") to the bird's neck. Other vertebrate taxa may have a comparable anatomical structure that is referred to as either a gular sac, throat sac, vocal sac or gular fold.\n\nGular skin can be very prominent, for example in members of the order Phalacrocoraciformes as well as in pelicans (which likely share a common ancestor). In many species, the gular skin forms a flap, or gular pouch, which is generally used to store fish and other prey while hunting.\n\nIn cormorants, the gular skin is often colored, contrasting with the otherwise plain black or black-and-white appearance of the bird. This presumably serves some function in social signalling, since the colors become more pronounced in breeding adults.\n\nIn frigatebirds, the gular skin (or gular sac or throat sac) is used dramatically. During courtship display, the male forces air into the sac, causing it to inflate over a period of 20 minutes into a startling huge red balloon. \n\nBecause cormorants are closer relatives of gannets and anhingas (which have no prominent gular pouch) than of frigatebirds or pelicans, it can be seen that the gular pouch is either plesiomorphic or was acquired by parallel evolution.\n\nThe orangutan is the only known great ape to have this characteristic, where it is only present in males. In addition the walrus and some species of gibbon or lesser ape such as the siamang have a throat sac. Many amphibians will inflate their vocal sac to create certain vocalizations in order to communicate, scare off rivals (to proclaim territory or dominance), and to locate and attract a mate. The gular sac in this instance amplifies their voice to be heard louder and seemingly closer. Some species of lizard also have a gular fold and consequently, gular scales.\n\nThe theropod dinosaur Pelecanimimus, which lived in the early Cretaceous Period 130 million years ago, also had a gular pouch, similar to the pelican after which it is named.\n\nThe conus snail has a throat sac.\n\n"}

Dec) and \"Strange Creations: Aberrant Ideas of Human Origins from Ancient Astronauts to Aquatic Apes\" (2001). Kossy was also the founder and curator of the Kooks Museum (1996–1999, online), and the editor-publisher of the magazine \"Book Happy\" (1997–2002, about \"weird and obscure books\").\n\nDescribed by \"Wired\" as \"an expert on kooks [who] has a genuine, if sometimes uncomfortable, affection for her subjects\", Kossy wrote books reviewed in publications ranging from \"Fortean Times\" to \"New Scientist\". Journalist Jonathan Vankin named her \"the unchallenged authority on, well, kooks\", and writer Bruce Sterling noted that she \"boldly blazes new trails in the vast intellectual wilderness of American writers, thinkers and philosophers who were or are completely nuts\".\n\nDonna J. Kossy was born in 1957. She started doing zines in sixth grade, co-editing \"Kid Stuff\" with a friend: \"It had gossip, fashions, poetry, jokes and even movie reviews. It sold for 5 cents. My mom typed it up and Xeroxed it at work!\" After graduating college in 1979, Kossy became involved in punk culture via collage art, color xerox postcards and mail art.\n\nKossy eventually became a computer programmer, but also published zines because \"Publishing is power, pure and simple\", and turned \"author and folklorist.\"\n\nAt one time, Kossy was the housemate of fellow zine maker Pagan Kennedy. She attuned Chicago writer Dan Kelly to cult \"kook\" Francis E. Dec. In the early 1980s, she was part of the \"Processed World\" (PW) magazine, then romantically involved with anti-PW and ex-SubGenius anarchist Bob Black until 1987, moving with him to Boston in 1985.\n\nIn 1989, research for her \"Kooks Magazine\" led Kossy to abandon much of her other work. She is now married to Ken DeVries (\"a.k.a.\" Orton Nenslo), also a member of the Church of the SubGenius and contributor to their books, who provided some illustrations for her books and some articles for her website.\n\nIn 1984, Kossy started publishing \"False Positive\" (1984–1988), a Xeroxed zine which ran for eleven issues. Each issue focused on one topic (such as technology, sex, Japan, cars, crime, kooks, food & drugs) and featured related book excerpts, satire, collages, drawings, etc.\n\nThe zine and Kossy were quoted by Discordianism co-founder Kerry Thornley (alias Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst) in his 1991 foreword to the 5th edition of the \"Principia Discordia\", reprinting the \"Manifesto of the Artistic Elite of the Midwest\". Kossy said that her \"career as a crackpotologist\" started there with the \"Kooks Pages\" within each issue and the two special all-kooks issues.\n\nIn 1988, Kossy started publishing \"Kooks Magazine\" (1988–1991), now using offset printing and running for eight issues. A spinoff of the kooks pages of her zine, it was in line with the 1988 book \"High Weirdness by Mail\" by SubGenius co-founder Rev. Ivan Stang (who later praised the collected book) and featured obscure \"kooks\" as well as some better-documented \"cranks\" such as reclusive Spider-Man co-creator Steve Ditko in its final issue (#8, November 1991).\n\nIn \"Factsheet Five\", the zine magazine, founder-editor Mike Gunderloy described it as \"A collection of bizarre literature and semi-scholarly research on kooks: those folks who have all the answers that science and the authorities have been trying to suppress. This issue features [...] progress towards a theory of kookdom.\" then reported one year later that it \"keeps getting better; you can spend hours lost in the worldviews here.\" SubGenius and writer Richard Kadrey described it as \"indispensable for anyone interested in the real bleeding edge of thought.\" Research for the topic even led Kossy to attend a recruitment meeting of Heaven's Gate (when it was calling itself Human Individual Metamorphosis), the group that ended in a 1997 mass suicide.\n\nIn 1994, Feral House published Kossy's first book, \"Kooks: A Guide to the Outer Limits of Human Belief\", an anthology containing updated articles from her zine along with articles written exclusively for the book, with the cover illustration painted by her husband. Organized into seven parts (Religion, Science, Metaphysics, Politics, Conspiracy, Enigmas; plus Outtakes in the 2nd ed.), it documented the rants and ravings of \"kooks\" such as Richard Brothers (Anglo-Israelism alias British Israelism), Charles E. Buon (God's Envoy to the U.S.A.), Ray Crabtree (The Philosopher King), the first biography of Francis E. Dec (Your Only Hope against the Gangster Computer God), Professor Arnold Ehret (Mucusless Diet Healing System), Joe Gould alias Professor Seagull (The Longest Book Ever Written), Jim and Lila Green (Aggressive Christianity Missionary Training Corps), Hillman Holcomb (Well Regulated Militia of Christian Technocracy), Les U. Knight (Voluntary Human Extinction Movement), alien abductee artist Paul Laffoley (Third Generation Lunatic Fringe), Alfred Lawson (Lawsonomy: The Base for Absolute Knowledge), David Linton (How Men Can Have Babies), Emil Matalik (World/U.S. Presidential Candidate Since 1964), the MIT's crank files (The Archive of Useless Research), Rose Mokry (Jewish Poisoners Are the Sole Producers of All the Diseases, Sudden Deaths and Birth Defects), Dr. Cyrus Teed (not Cyrus Tweed) alias Koresh (Koreshanity: We Actually Live on the Inside of the Earth), black supremacist Dwight York alias Malachi Z. York et al. (Ansaaru Allah Community of Nuwaubianism), etc.\n\nThe book was praised as \"a rich compendium of looniness\" by the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"indispensable for anyone interested in the real cutting edge of thought\" by the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", and a \"delight\" by \"Fortean Times\". In \"Factsheet Five\", the new editor R. Seth Friedman recommended it with, \"I've been anxiously awaiting this book ever since Donna Kossy told me about her plans several years ago. [...] Don't miss out on this book.\" Jay Kinney, publisher of \"Gnosis Magazine\", found it \"Compulsively readable. The 'kooks' collected in this volume are our true American originals and Donna Kossy chronicles their jaw-dropping messages with a rare mix of objectivity, sympathy, and wit.\" And a 1995 \"Wired\" review described Kossy as \"an expert on kooks [who] has a genuine, if sometimes uncomfortable, affection for her subjects.\"\n\nIn 1995, \"Kooks Outtakes\" followed its namesake, being a 36-page supplement of material Kossy had left out for reasons of space; it was later merged with the second edition of the book in 2001, which the editor of \"Ink 19\" praised, noting that \"Kossy's style is direct and surprisingly unjudgemental. [...] Kossy is quite systematic in her research, and margin comments abound, along with a lush bibliography. This is serious stuff.\"\n\nIn 1996, Kossy founded and curated on her web site the \"Kooks Museum\" (an online summary and extension of her book \"Kooks\", updated until mid-1999 when it was discontinued and kept as an archive), explaining: \"As curator and founder of the first Kooks Museum in history I am fulfilling a half-life-long goal of housing kook ideas from all over the world under one crumbling roof. [...] The point of all this excess is neither to debunk nor to proselytize. Rather, my intent is to document and study the vast cornucopia of forgotten, discredited and extreme ideas, with all due consideration to social and cultural context. Nor do I think all ideas are equally valid. Rather, I try to be both open-minded to and skeptical of them.\"\n\nThe Museum was listed in the \"MetroActive\" guide to \"the most interesting, unusual, weird or otherwise alternative sites on the World Wide Web\" by journalist and writer on conspiracies Jonathan Vankin, who named Kossy \"the unchallenged authority on, well, kooks.\"\n\nIn 1997, Kossy started editing and publishing \"Book Happy\" (1997–2002), a printed magazine which ran for seven issues. Written by Kossy and others (recurrent contributors includes Greg Bishop, Ken DeVries, Dan Howland, Dan Kelly, John Marr, Chris Mikul, David C. Morrison, Chip Rowe, Brian Tucker, Robert Tucker), it was dedicated to reviewing \"weird and obscure books\".\n\nThe magazine was complemented by her web site (later becoming its domain name) and the formation of Book Happy Booksellers () an online used book business specializing in unusual and hard-to-find items, with inventory listed on various book listing sites including Abebooks, Biblio, Alibris, Choosebooks and others. \"Book Happy\" was reviewed positively by English artist Mark Pawson (creator of \"Die-Cut Plug Wiring Diagram Book\") in a 1999 review for the British cultural magazine \"Variant\".\n\nIn 2001, Feral House published Kossy's second full-length book, \"Strange Creations: Aberrant Ideas of Human Origins from Ancient Astronauts to Aquatic Apes\" (right after reprinting \"Kooks\" in an expanded edition). As of August 1998, Kossy had already announced the manuscript for her second book as being finished (with a tentative title balancing between \"Aberrant Anthropology\" and \"Nazis, Saucers and Aquatic Apes\") and its publication at Feral House scheduled for \"Fall, 1999\"; it would however be two more years before the actual release.\n\nOrganized into seven parts (Extraterrestrial Origins, De-evolution, Race, Eugenics, Creationism, The Aquatic Ape Theory, and Urantia/Szukalski/H.I.M.), the book documented the fringe and pseudoscientific theories of \"crackpots\" such as David Barclay (mankind as dinosaurs pets), Helena Blavatsky (The Seven Root Races of Theosophy), Darwin's cousin Francis Galton (inventor of eugenics against regression toward the mean), Henry H. Goddard (inventor of moronism with The Kallikak Family), Madison Grant (Nordicism and scientific racism), Finnvald Hedin (The Thorians), Brinsley Le Poer Trench (UFOs from Hollow Earth), slave trader Edward Long (Polygenism: Man Comes From God, Negroes Come From Apes), Oscar Kiss Maerth (The Beginning Was the End: ape brain cannibalism), Alfred W. McCann (creationism), Elaine Morgan (aquatic ape hypothesis), Raël (creation by extraterrestrials), B. H. Shadduck (de-evolution), Zecharia Sitchin (ancient astronauts), Lothrop Stoddard (Pan-Aryanism and racial purity), Stanisław Szukalski (Zermatism: post-deluge Easter Island vs. Yetis), the \"Urantia Book\" (intelligent design by Life Carriers), George Van Tassel (Space Brothers aliens), Erich von Däniken (Ancient Astronauts from the Chariots of the Gods?), etc.\n\nThe book was praised from \"Fortean Times\" to \"Booklist\" and from the \"Washington City Paper\" to \"Counterpoise\". In a mixed review, the \"New Scientist\" noted that \"Donna Kossy's \"Strange Creatures\" [sic!] is about people who have spent rather more time on these problems than most, visiting some of the weirder reaches of the human imagination\". And Rev. Ivan Stang remarked: \"To write entertainingly for 'nonkooks' about so-called kooks, crackpots, and possible visionaries requires walking a tightrope between tolerant understanding of 'outsider' psychology and graceful sarcasm, balancing both a solid grounding in the mainstream scientific paradigm, and a healthy distrust of the status quo.\"\n\nScience-fiction writer Bruce Sterling, who also touched upon online cranks in his essay \"Electronic Text\", commented that \"Donna Kossy boldly blazes new trails in the vast intellectual wilderness of American writers, thinkers, and philosophers who were or are completely nuts. \"Kooks\" ranks with such sociological classics as Mackay's \"Extraordinary Popular Delusions\" and Dudley's \"Mathematical Cranks\". This, for obvious reasons, is a book which every science fiction writer should possess.\" In her own words, Kossy has stated, \"I seek not to debunk strange ideas, but to present them as a necessary segment of the full spectrum of human thought.\"\n\nKossy is currently focused on her bookselling business and from November 2007 to September 2008 wrote a blog, \"The Cutthroat World of Book Scouting\" (http://bookhappy.easyjournal.com<nowiki>)</nowiki>, which chronicled her experiences in the book trade.\n\n\n\n\nMain sources used for this article:\n\n\n"}

After four years of secular primary education, he began religious studies with Rabbi Chaim Yehuda Levi. When Germany occupied the area in 1944, the Nazis sent his entire family to Auschwitz where they were killed. Amital was sent to a labor camp, thus surviving the Holocaust. He remained in the labor camp for eight months, and was liberated on October 4, 1944, by the Soviet Army. After his liberation, he made his way to Bucharest, from where he travelled to Palestine, arriving on December 11, 1944.\n\nAfter a short stay at the Atlit detainee camp, he made his way to Jerusalem, where he studied at Hebron Yeshiva, receiving semicha from Rabbi Isser Zalman Meltzer. He also learned with Rabbi Yaakov Moshe Charlap, a student of Rabbi Avraham Yitzchak Kook. Around this time, he joined the Haganah.\n\nAfter learning at Hebron, he moved to Pardes Hanna in order to learn at Kletzk Yeshiva. While learning at the yeshiva, he married Miriam, the daughter of the Rosh Yeshiva, Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Meltzer, and the granddaughter of Rabbi Isser Zalman Meltzer. When the yeshiva relocated to Rehovot, Amital followed, settling in Rehovot until he moved to Jerusalem in the 1960s.\n\nThe day after the Declaration of Independence, Amital's unit was mobilized. He took part in battles of Latrun and the western Galilee. After the war, Amital became a rabbinic secretary in the Beth Din of Rehovot, and, two years later, he became an instructor at Yeshivat HaDarom, where he helped formulate the idea of a Hesder Yeshiva.\n\nAmital died on July 9 (27 Tammuz), 2010, and was laid to rest in the Har HaMenuchot cemetery in Jerusalem, where thousands attended his funeral.\n\nIn 1988, Amital founded the left-leaning religious Meimad movement, and was elected as its chairman after it became a political party. In 1995, he served as a Minister without Portfolio in the government of Shimon Peres, despite not being a Knesset member.\n\nAfter the Six-Day War, he founded Yeshivat Har Etzion, a Hesder Yeshiva in Gush Etzion. The yeshiva opened in Kfar Etzion in 1968 with 30 students. After two years, the institution moved to its current location in Alon Shvut. In 1971, Amital asked Aharon Lichtenstein to join him as Rosh Yeshiva.\n\nAt the age of 80, Amital asked the management of Yeshivat Har Etzion to select his successors. The yeshiva chose Rabbis Yaaqov Medan and Baruch Gigi. On January 4, 2006, Medan and Gigi were officially invested as co-roshei yeshiva, alongside Amital and Aharon Lichtenstein.\n\nOn September 25, 2008, Amital officially announced his retirement, to take effect on the last day of the Jewish month of Tishrei, in the year 5769 (October 28, 2008). He also announced that Mosheh Lichtenstein, the son of Aharon Lichtenstein, would assume the position as the fourth Rosh Yeshiva on that same day.\n\nAmital continued to be a prominent public figure in Israel, with a broad impact on matters of religious and national concern. His students and disciples are leading figures in many walks of life. He had developed an educational philosophy which combines deep faithfulness to tradition and ethical responsibility to society at large with commitment to the moral and spiritual flourishing of each individual.\n\n\n"}

The status of Crimea is disputed between Russia and Ukraine as a result of the 2014 vote to join Russia which was held during Russian military intervention, and the subsequent annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation. It serves as the administrative center of Alushta Municipality, one of the regions Crimea is divided into. Founded in the 6th century AD by Emperor Justinian, today it is a resort town. It is situated at the Black Sea beach line on the road from Hurzuf to Sudak, as well as on the Crimean Trolleybus line.

It used to be thought that he was the son of Commodore Pieter van Brakel, who was killed in the Second Anglo-Dutch War while defending a convoy of merchant ships, but this has become very unlikely considering Pieter was born in 1624.\n\nThe first time Van Brakel appears in the documents is in 1666, when he was appointed by the Admiralty of the Maze as acting captain—with the rank of lieutenant—of a fireship, the \"Rotterdam\", that participated in the Four Days Battle. Apparently he already had been a lieutenant in 1665. Fireships were often manned by the most desperate elements in society; the humility of his origins might explain the fact they were never mentioned.\n\nAt St. James's Day Battle, having spent another fireship and returning with his crew in sloops, Van Brakel saved the \"Gelderland\", the flagship of Lieutenant-Admiral Willem Joseph van Ghent from an attack by an English fireship. Because of the courage shown, Van Brakel was promoted to captain of a regular ship on 22 September 1666, a rare accomplishment for a fireship commander. In 1667, while in command of the frigate \"Vrede\", he became one of the heroes of the raid on the Medway and was given the honourable task of triumphantly towing the captured English flagship out of the Medway river. That same year Van Brakel was promoted full captain on 17 December.\n\nIn 1672, at the battle of Solebay—the first battle of the Third Anglo-Dutch War—Van Brakel served as captain of \"Groot Hollandia\", and played a major part in the burning of HMS \"Royal James\". In 1673, he continued to fight with distinction at the battle of Schooneveld and the battle of the Texel, as captain of \"Voorzichtigheid\". \n\nOn 5 April 1684, Van Brakel was promoted to rear admiral of the Admiralty of Amsterdam. Four years later, as a temporary vice admiral—from October 1688 until January 1689—he was part of the fleet that brought William III to England in the invasion that led to the Glorious Revolution. From 1688 onwards, Van Brakel served on the amalgamated Anglo-Dutch fleet until he was killed in the battle of Beachy Head in 1690.\n\nHis grave memorial is located in Rotterdam's St. Lawrence Church. He is the namesake of , a former Dutch naval vessel.\n"}

It is located to the west of Yalta. It is famous for the Vorontsov Palace, designed by English architect Edward Blore in an extravagant mixture of Scottish baronial and Neo-Moorish styles and built in 1828–1846 for prince Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov. Population: Sister-city: Apopka, Florida, USA.\n\nAlupka and its surrounding area is full of resort hotels on the shore of the Black Sea, where thousands of travelers (particularly from the former Soviet Union) travel every year. Public transport to Alupka includes the bus system (bus routes #26 and #27 from Yalta) and other road vehicles.\n\nLocated in the warm climate of southern Crimea, Alupka has an average temperature of +3-4°С in January–February and an average temperature of +24.6°С in August. The average rainfall in the city is 400 mm per year, the average humidity is about 69%, and the average number of sunlight per year is 2,150 hours. The swimming season streaches from March until October, with an average water temperature of .\n\nAlupka was first founded as a Greek settlement. The name originates from the Greek word for fox (\"Alopex\") . After the Greeks, Alupka came under control of the Byzantine Empire. The first written mention of Alupka dates to 960 in a document about the Byzantine Emperor Romanos II. Later on, Alupka was controlled by the Crimean Tatars. After 1783 the city came into possession of Grigori Alexandrovich Potemkin, governor-general of the Novorossiya Krai. In 1798, the city had a population of 211, consisting mainly of farmers.\n\nAt the end of 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries, Alupka was a famous resort. In the middle of 19th century it was even more popular than Yalta, mostly because of the work of the Governor of NovoRossia - Mikhail Vorontsov, who build here a Palace (or even better say, Castle).\n\nAlupka is not only a resort town, but also an important tourist attraction. Major attractions in the city include:\n\nThe main attraction of Alupka is the Scottish baronial and Neo-Moorish style Vorontsov's Palace, which was designed by the English architect Edward Blore built in 1828-1846 for prince Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov. During the Yalta Conference, the palace—spared by the Germans during World War II — served as the residence of Sir Winston Churchill and his English delegation.\n\nA large English-style park was designed and built for prince Vorontsov on the territory of the Vorontsov's Palace. The park was constructed from December 1824 to April 1851, and was envisioned, designed, created, and maintained by Chief Botanist of the Southern Shore of the Crimea, Carolus Antonius Keebach. Plant material for the garden was supplied from the Nikita Botanic Garden by its director, Nicolai Anders von Hartwiss.\n\nThere is also a selection of various Hotels and restaurants. There are many things to do in central Alupka such as look at Ai Petri mountain and even take a cable car there.\n\nAlupka is located at the foot of the 1234 meter Ai-Petri (St Peter) Mount of the Crimean Mountains chain. Since 1987, a three kilometer Gondola lift, one of the longest in Europe and split into two stages, carries passengers to and from the mountain, providing visitors with excellent views of the surrounding area and the Black Sea.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2295913", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2295913", "title": "Joseph Ki-Zerbo", "text": "Joseph Ki-Zerbo\n\nJoseph Ki-Zerbo (June 21, 1922 – December 4, 2006, Burkina Faso) was a Burkinabé historian, politician and writer. He is recognized as one of Africa's foremost thinkers.\n\nFrom 1972 to 1978 he was professor of African History at the University of Ouagadougou. In 1983, he was forced into exile, only being able to return in 1992.\n\nKi-Zerbo founded the Party for Democracy and Progress / Socialist Party. He was its chairman until 2005, and represented it in the Burkina Faso parliament until his death in 2006. A socialist and an advocate of African independence and unity, Ki-Zerbo was also a vocal opponent of Thomas Sankara's revolutionary government.\n\nKi-Zerbo was born in Toma in the province of Nayala, in what was, at that time, the French colony of Upper Volta. He was the son of Alfred Diban Ki Zerbo and Thérèse Folo Ki. His father is considered to be the first Burkinabé Christian. In 1915 he intervened during the Volta-Bani War to stop Toma being razed to the ground.\n\nBetween 1933 and 1940, Ki-Zerbo was educated at the Catholic primary school in Toma, then completed his secondary school at the preparatory seminaries in Pabré in the Province of Kadiogo and Faladié, a district of Bamako, Mali. He then attended the Grand Séminaire Saint-Pierre Claver at Koumi near Bobo Dioulasso, which trains young men for the Catholic priesthood.\n\nHowever, Ki-Zerbo dropped out of the Seminary and went to live in Dakar, Senegal for several years. In addition to teaching there, he had a job for several months with the weekly newspaper \"Afrique nouvelle\", and also worked as a railway construction labourer.\n\nKi-Zerbo continued his education part-time and, when he obtained his Baccalaureate in 1949 at the age of 27, he earned a scholarship to study in Paris. He studied history and law at the Sorbonne and also followed courses in politics at the Sciences Po. On completion of his studies, he became a certified history and geography teacher, the first from Upper Volta.\n\nAfter his studies, Ki-Zerbo became a French citizen and was employed as a history and geography teacher in Orléans, Paris and Dakar. During a visit to Mali, Ki-Zerbo met his wife Jacqueline Coulibaly, the daughter of a Malian union leader.\n\nKi-Zerbo's political activities started while he was student. He was the co-founder and president of the \"Association of Upper Volta Students in France\" (1950–1956). He was also the president of the \"Association of African, Caribbean and Malagash Christian Students\". In 1954, Ki-Zerbo published an article in the newspaper \"Tam-Tam\" with the title “On demande des nationalistes” (“We ask the nationalists”). In Paris, Ki-Zerbo met other intellectuals, such as the Senegalese historian Cheik Anta Diop and Abdoulaye Wade, who was later to become president of Senegal.\n\nThe 1950s was a decade of great optimism in Africa, with many leaders demanding independence. Ki-Zerbo was active in this movement for change, and in 1957 he created a political party, the Mouvement de Liberation Nationale (MLN) (National Freedom Movement). He also established contact with Kwame Nkrumah, president of the newly independent neighboring state of Ghana.\n\nThe aims of the MLN were immediate independence for Africans, the creation of a United States of Africa, and socialism. The MLN contacted nationalist leaders in many of the other French colonies, to persuade them to reject the referendum on the creation of a Franco-African community presented by the French president Charles de Gaulle. However, in the whole of West Africa at that time, only Guinea voted no to the referendum and, as a result, achieved its independence relatively early in 1958. As a result, Sekou Touré, the first president of independent Guinea, invited Ki-Zerbo and his wife along with other volunteers to come to Conakry to replace the French teachers who had left.\n\nIn 1960, Ki-Zerbo returned to newly independent Upper Volta, explaining to Sekou Touré that \"I have to go back home to pursue the fight for independence in others territories”. In 1965, he was nominated as academy inspector and general director of Youth, Sports and Education.\n\nKi-Zerbo was professor at the University of Ouagadougou from 1968 to 1973. He was the co-founder and general director (1967 to 1979) of the Conseil africain et malgache pour l'enseignement supérieur (African and Malagasy Council on Higher Education (CAMES) that assures the academic autonomy of Africans countries.\n\nKi-Zerbo declared that growing up in a rural area in a big family profoundly influenced his personality and thoughts.\n\nKi-Zerbo exposed his social and political ideas in many publications on history and culture. He wrote a teaching manual called \"Le Monde Africain Noire\" (\"Black African World\"), published in 1963. In 1972, Ki-Zerbo published the famous \"Histoire de l’Afrique Noire\" (\"History of Black Africa\") that became a reference book in African history. Holenstein (2006) described that, in his book, Ki-Zerbo challenged the common belief of Africa as a black continent without culture and history. He claimed that Africa had reached an upper level of political, social and cultural development before the Atlantic slave trade and colonization. Written only few years after independence, \"Histoire de l’Afrique Noire\" represented the hope of many Africans of a brighter future in liberty and self-determination.\n\nSitchet (2003), an \"Africultures\" reporter, argued that from 1972 to 1978 Ki-Zerbo was an executive member of UNESCO (United Nations Education Scientific and Cultural Organization). From 1976 to 2001, Ki-Zerbo was the president of the African Historian Association and a professor at the University of Ouagadougou.\n\nHis conviction on education led him to found in 1980 the Centre for African Development Studies (CEDA) that has this goal “on ne developpe pas, on se developpe” (\"we don’t develop, we develop ourselves\"). Holenstein (2006) insisted that on the basis of a critic on the relation north–south imperialism, Ki-Zerbo forecast an endogenous development that will take seriously ecological and social skills, and the African cultural identity. His endogenous development is a practice that lets native farmers use their own ideas and traditions alongside new technology. It incorporates the ideas and knowledge of indigenous cultures rather than disregarding them.\n\nAfter scientific research and teaching, Ki-Zerbo continued with his political activities. Under the Burkinabe President Maurice Yameogo’s regime (1960-1966), the creation of any political party was forbidden. Holenstein (2006) explained this in an article on the interview about Ki-Zerbo’s book \"A quand l’Afrique\". Ki-Zerbo got his members in the syndical teachers’ class and villagers. The syndicate and MLN played a big role in the popular movement organization on 3 January 1966 that brought down the President Maurice Yameogo. General Secretary of the MLN, Ki-Zerbo went to the 1970s legislative elections; he got sixth rank.\n\nIn February the Burkina Faso parliament was ruined during a military coup. In October, banning was cancelled. Many new parties arose like Union Progressiste Voltaique (UPV) under the control of Ki-Zerbo that replaced MLN. UPV was in opposition to the government party (Union Democratique Voltaique-Rassemblement Democratique Africain (UDV-RDA).)\n\nIn 1983, a group of young officers took power by a military coup under the control of the Captain Thomas Sankara. A new stage started for Upper Volta which became Burkina Faso (“Land of the upright”). Under the power of the new government, Ki-Zerbo was obliged to go into exile.\n\nIn 1985 he was finally arrested with his family for two years of detention and became free only after another military coup organized by Blaise Compaore. Even in exile, he created research centers like the Research Centre for Endogenous Development (CRDE) and taught at Cheikh Anta Diop University in Dakar. He returned to Burkina Faso in 1987 to find that his library of 11,000 books in his hometown Faso had been burned in his absence. He came back and tried to rebuild by getting a place in parliament.\n\nKi-Zerbo has received recognition through various international awards. \n\nKi-Zerbo as an historian has published books with endogenous development as the central theme:\nIn 2004, his book \"A quand l'Afrique\" was awarded the RFI prize \"Témoin du monde\".\n\nIn addition, Ki Zerbo was a committed historian and politician. Ki-Zerbo extended his fights internationally to make people recognize slavery as a crime against humanity and that Africa should get reparations for this. He tried to combine science and political activity. Ki-Zerbo summed his philosophy up in the following quote:\n“The Africa which the world needs is a continent able to stand up, to walk on its own feet… it is an Africa conscious of its own past and able to keep on reinvesting this past into its present and future.”\n"}

He debuted for the Samoa national rugby union team in 1990. He featured in Samoa's famous World Cup win over Wales in 1991, and he was the youngest player at the 1991 Rugby World Cup.\n\nOne of Lima's most illuminating moments came in Samoa's match against South Africa in a group match at the 2003 Rugby World Cup. As Springbok fly-half Derick Hougaard leapt up in the air to catch a hospital pass, Lima \"dive-tackled\" him, sending Hougaard crashing to the ground..\n\nLima was the first player to appear in five World Cups, his fifth being the 2007 World Cup in France, in which he came on against South Africa in Samoa's first game after 60 minutes. According to the \"Samoa Observer\", Lima announced that he would retire after the 2007 Rugby World Cup. Michael Jones, the Samoa coach (at that time), announced Lima as the captain for the first game of that year's Pacific Nations Cup. Brian Lima was selected to lead Samoa against Fiji.

These organosulfur compounds have the formula [SR]. Together with a negatively charged counterion, they give sulfonium salts. They are typically colorless solids that are soluble in organic solvent.\n\nSulfonium compounds are usually synthesized by the reaction of thioethers with alkyl halides. For example, the reaction of dimethyl sulfide with iodomethane yields trimethylsulfonium iodide:\n\nBefore the above reaction, the sulfur atom has two lone electron pairs. One of these lone pairs links to the methyl group. At the same time, as part of a concerted nucleophilic substitution mechanism (S2), the iodide leaving group departs. This leaves a positively charged trimethylsulfonium ion, whose charge is balanced by the iodide. The rate of reaction is even faster with stronger methylating agents, such as methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate.\n\nThe compounds are pyramidal at sulfur. Thus, MeS is isostructural and isoelectronic to trimethylphosphine. Sulfonium compounds wherein the three substituents differ are chiral and optically stable.\n\nThe sulfonium (more specifically methioninium) species \"S\"-adenosylmethionine occurs widely in nature, where it is used as a source of the adenosoyl radical. This radical participates in the biosynthesis of various compounds.\nAnother, sulfonium (methioninium) species found in nature is \"S\"-methylmethionine.\n\nSulfonium salts are precursor to sulfur ylides, which are useful in C-C forming reactions. In a typical application, a RSCHR′ center is deprotonated to give the ylide RSCHR.\n\nTris(dimethylamino)sulfonium difluorotrimethylsilicate [((CH)N)S][FSi(CH)] is a popular fluoridation agent.\n\nSome azo dyes are modified with sulfonium groups to give them a positive charge.

Also known as Yampa Valley Regional Airport, it has the only scheduled passenger flights to northwest Colorado. It is also used by larger business jets that cannot use the smaller Steamboat Springs Airport (Bob Adams Field).\n\nThe National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 called it a \"primary commercial service\" airport (more than 10,000 enplanements per year). Federal Aviation Administration records say it had 136,600 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 122,480 in 2009 and 110,044 in 2010.\n\nYampa Valley Airport covers at an elevation of . Its asphalt runway, 10/28, is .\n\nThe airport recently completed Phase II of a project that expanded the terminal, apron and parking lots. The project will cost about $18 million. The airport has six gates that can handle Boeing 757s, Boeing 737s, Bombardier Dash 8 Q400s, Airbus A319s, Canadair CRJ 200s, CRJ 700s and Embraer 170s. Like other Colorado airports serving ski resorts, there are no jetbridges, only open air airstairs. The private ramp can handle up to 30 private jets. In the winter months larger private jets such as the Boeing 737 cannot be parked due to lack of space and must depart after deplaning passengers.\n\nThe airport has no air traffic control tower. All aircraft are on a CTAF (123.0) and/or Unicom. All aircraft receive approach control services from the Denver Air Route Traffic Control Center. Gates and aircraft parking slots can be assigned via the airport operation radio communication channel. Jet A fuel is provided by the FBO (fixed-base operator), Atlantic Aviation. All aircraft departing runway 28 make a right or left turn to avoid the populated area of Hayden. Runway 10 has an Instrument Landing System (ILS). Snow and low ceilings during winter months cause some aircraft to divert to other airports including Denver International Airport.\n\nIn the year ending December 31, 2018 the airport had 11,474 aircraft operations, average 31 per day: 47% general aviation, 18% scheduled airline, 34% air taxi, and <1% military. Eight aircraft were then based at this airport: four single-engine and four multi-engine.\n\nThe airport has two ARFF trucks in the operations garage that are run by full-time and seasonal firefighters. They operate ARFF index C from December to March, and ARFF index B from April to November. The ARFF trucks are staffed by firefighters when a scheduled flight is arriving or departing with more than 10 passengers. Local fire departments, like The North Routt Fire Protection District and the West Routt Fire Protection District, can respond to the airport if mutual aid is needed. Transportation can be provided by local taxi, Lyft, Uber, and two shuttle companies with staffed help desks in the baggage claim terminal.\n\nAll seasonal flights during ski season begin in December and end in April. The only year-round scheduled flights are to Denver International Airport by SkyWest flying as United Express with CRJ-200s and CRJ-700s and by Trans States Airlines, also United Express, with Embraer family ERJ 145 regional jets. Mainline jets operated by the three major airlines during ski season include the Airbus A319 and A320 as well as the Boeing 737-800, Boeing 717 and 757-200.\n\nAt 1:56 PM on March 14, 2001, TWA flight 641, a McDonnell Douglas MD-81 from St. Louis Lambert International Airport with 122 passengers and crew, mistakenly landed at the Craig-Moffat Airport (CAG) while on approach into the Yampa Valley Airport during a snowstorm. Craig-Moffat Airport is located approximately 17 miles west of Hayden, Colorado, and its only runway, 7/25, measures 5,600 feet—nearly half that of the Yampa Valley Airport’s 10,000 foot runway 10/28. Though the flight landed safely with no injuries, the aircraft did get stuck in mud while attempting a turn at the end of the runway.

{"id": "2295928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2295928", "title": "Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond", "text": "Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond\n\nCharles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond, 2nd Duke of Lennox, 2nd Duke of Aubigny, (18 May 17018 August 1750) of Goodwood House near Chichester in Sussex, was a British nobleman and politician. He was the son of Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond, 1st Duke of Lennox, the youngest of the seven illegitimate sons of King Charles II. He was the most important of the early patrons of the game of cricket and did much to help its evolution from village cricket to first-class cricket.\n\nLennox was styled Earl of March from his birth in 1701 as heir to his father's dukedom. He also inherited his father's love of sports, particularly cricket. He had a serious accident at the age of 12 when he was thrown from a horse during a hunt, but he recovered and it did not deter him from horsemanship.\n\nMarch entered into an arranged marriage in December 1719 when he was still only 18 and his bride, Hon. Sarah Cadogan, was just 13, in order to use Sarah's large dowry to pay his considerable debts. They were married at The Hague.\n\nIn 1722, March became Member of Parliament for Chichester as first member with Sir Thomas Miller as his second. He gave up his seat after his father died in May 1723 and he succeeded to the title of 2nd Duke of Richmond. A feature of Richmond's career was the support he received from his wife, Sarah, her interest being evident in surviving letters. Their marriage was a great success, especially by Georgian standards.\n\nTheir grandson who became the 4th Duke is known to cricket history as the Hon. Col. Charles Lennox, a noted amateur batsman of the late 18th century who was one of Thomas Lord's main guarantors when he established his new ground in Marylebone.\n\nThe 2nd Duke of Richmond has been described as early cricket's greatest patron. Although he had played cricket as a boy, his real involvement began after he succeeded to the dukedom. He captained his own team and his players included some of the earliest known professionals, such as his groom Thomas Waymark. Later, when he patronised Slindon Cricket Club, Richmond was associated with the Newland brothers. His earliest recorded match is the one against Sir William Gage's XI on 20 July 1725, which is mentioned in a surviving letter from Sir William to the Duke.\n\nRecords have survived of four matches played by Richmond's team in the 1727 season. Two were against Gage's XI and two against an XI raised by the Surrey patron Alan Brodrick. These last two games are highly significant because Richmond and Brodrick drew up Articles of Agreement beforehand to determine the rules that must apply in their contests. These were itemised in sixteen points. It is believed that this was the first time that rules (or some part of the rules as in this case) were formally agreed, although rules as such definitely existed. The first full codification of the Laws of Cricket was done in 1744. In early times, the rules would be agreed upon orally and were subject to local variations; this syndrome was also evident in football until the FA was founded, especially regarding the question of handling the ball. Essentially the articles of agreement focused on residential qualifications and ensuring that there was no dissent by any player other than the two captains.\n\nIn 1728, Richmond's Sussex played twice against Edwin Stead's Kent and lost both matches, \"(Kent's) men have been too expert for those of Sussex\". In 1730, Richmond's team played two matches against Gage's XI and another match against a Surrey XI backed by a Mr Andrews of Sunbury. Richmond lost to Andrews. The second of his matches against Gage, due to be played at The Dripping Pan, near Lewes, was \"put off on account of Waymark, the Duke's man, being ill\".\n\nIn 1731, Richmond was involved in one of the most controversial matches recorded in the early history of cricket. On 16 August, his Sussex team played a Middlesex XI backed by one Thomas Chambers at an unspecified venue in Chichester. Chambers' team won this match, which had a prize of 100 guineas, and a return was arranged to take place at Richmond Green on 23 August. The return match was played for 200 guineas and it is notable as the earliest match of which the team scores are known: Richmond's XI 79, Chambers' XI 119; Richmond's XI 72, Chambers' XI 23–5 (approx.). The game ended promptly at a pre-agreed time although Chambers' XI with \"four or five more to have come in\" and needing \"about 8 to 10 notches\" clearly had the upper hand. The end result caused a fracas among the crowd at Richmond Green, who were incensed by the prompt finish because the Duke of Richmond had arrived late and delayed the start of the game. The riot resulted in some of the Sussex players \"having the shirts torn off their backs\" and it was said \"a law suit would commence about the play\". In a note about another match involving Chambers' XI in September, G. B. Buckley has recorded that Richmond may have conceded the result to Chambers, presumably to stop the threat of litigation.\n\nRichmond is not mentioned in cricket sources again for ten years. He may have stepped aside after the 1731 fracas but it is more likely that he terminated his Duke of Richmond's XI after he broke his leg in 1733 and could no longer play himself. Instead, he channelled his enthusiasm for cricket through a team from the small village of Slindon, which bordered on his Goodwood estate.\n\nThe rise to fame of Slindon Cricket Club was based on the play of Richard Newland and the patronage of Richmond. On Thursday, 9 July 1741, in a letter to her husband, the Duchess of Richmond mentions a conversation with John Newland regarding a Slindon v. East Dean match at Long Down, near Eartham, a week earlier. This is the earliest recorded mention of any of the Newland family. Then, on 28 July, Richmond sent two letters to the Duke of Newcastle to tell him about a game that day which had resulted in a brawl with \"hearty blows\" and \"broken heads\". The game was at Portslade between Slindon, who won, and unnamed opponents.\n\nOn Monday 7 September 1741, Slindon played Surrey at Merrow Down, near Guildford. Richmond, in a letter to the Duke of Newcastle before the game, spoke of \"poor little Slyndon against almost your whole county of Surrey\". Next day he wrote again, saying that \"wee (\"sic\") have beat Surrey almost in one innings\".\n\nThe Duchess wrote to him on Wednesday 9 September and said she \"wish'd... that the Sussex mobb (\"sic\") had thrash'd the Surrey mob\". She had \"a grudge to those fellows ever since they mob'd you\" (apparently a reference to the Richmond Green fiasco in August 1731). She then said she wished the Duke \"had won more of their moneys\".\n\nIn 1744, Richmond created what is now the world's oldest known scorecard for the match between London and Slindon at the Artillery Ground on 2 June. Slindon won by 55 runs and the original scorecard is now among Richmond's papers in the possession of the West Sussex Records Office.\n\nIn August 1745, Richmond backed a Sussex XI against Surrey in a match at Berry Hill, near Arundel. It appears that Surrey won the game in view of a comment made by Lord John Philip Sackville in a letter to Richmond dated Saturday 14 September: \"I wish you had let Ridgeway play instead of your stopper behind it might have turned the match in our favour\".\n\nWhen single wicket became the dominant form of cricket in the late 1740s, Richmond entered a number of teams mostly centred on Stephen Dingate, who was in his employ at the time. For example, a number of matches were played by a \"threes\" team of Dingate, Joseph Rudd and Pye. Richmond often found himself opposed by his former groom Thomas Waymark, still an outstanding player but now resident in Berkshire.\n\nRichmond died on 8 August 1750. He had been arguably the greatest of the game's early patrons, particularly of the Slindon club and of Sussex cricket in general. His death was followed by a slump in the fortunes of Sussex cricket, which featured few matches of significance until the rise of Brighton Cricket Club in the 1790s.\n\nRichmond held many titles, including the Order of the Garter (KG), Order of the Bath (KCB), Privy Counsellor (PC) and Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS). In 1734 he succeeded to the title of Duke of Aubigny in France on the death of his grandmother Louise de Kérouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth.\n\nHe served as Lord of the Bedchamber to King George II from 1727 and, in 1735, he was appointed Master of the Horse.\n\nHe was admitted a Fellow of the Royal Society on 1724. Later that year, he followed his father, the 1st Duke, into freemasonry and was a Grand Master of the Premier Grand Lodge of England in 1724, a few years after its formation in 1717. His father had been a Master Mason in Chichester in 1696.\n\nAs Duke of Aubigny, he also assisted in introducing freemasonry into France. In 1734, he created a masonic lodge in the Chateau d'Aubigny neart Metz in north-east France. One a year later, with another past Grand Master, John Theophilus Desaguliers, he assisted in inaugurating a lodge in the hotel at Rue Bussy, in Paris.\n\nHe was elected Mayor of Chichester for 1735–36.\n\nRichmond was one of the founding Governors of London's Foundling Hospital, which received its Royal Charter from George II in 1739. The Foundling Hospital was a charity dedicated to saving London's abandoned children. Both the Duke and the Duchess took great interest in the project. The Duke attended committee meetings and both took part in the baptism and naming of the first children accepted by the hospital in March 1741.\n\nRichmond was a Lieutenant-General in the British Army and served under the notorious Duke of Cumberland in the Hanoverian campaign against the Jacobite rising of 1745.\n\nThe 1740s was a turbulent time for Sussex. There was a rise in smuggling gangs; of these probably, the most violent was the notorious Hawkhurst Gang.\n\nThe gang were responsible for the brutal murder of a bootmaker and a customs official. Richmond decided to pursue those responsible with a vengeance. He began by petitioning the authorities so that a special assize could be held at Chichester. He did not trust the local Justices (in West Sussex), as they could not be relied on to convict smugglers. He therefore obtained authorisation for judges to be brought down from London. The judges (Sir Thomas Birch, Sir Michael Foster and Baron Clive) made their way under guard to Goodwood, where Richmond entertained them before the trial. His pogrom against the gang, was possibly partly because it was feared that the smugglers were assisting the Jacobites by providing intelligence to the French.\n\nAll the culprits involved in the murder of the two men were captured and convicted.\n\nDuring Richmond's two-year campaign, against the illegal trade, thirty-five smugglers were executed and another ten died in gaol before they could be hanged. However although his campaign managed to reduce the incidence of smuggling it was reported by the writer Horace Walpole, in 1752 (after Richmond's death) that Sussex was \"stiff\" with smugglers.\n\nRichmond married Lady Sarah Cadogan (1705–1751), daughter of William Cadogan, 1st Earl Cadogan, on 4 December 1719 at The Hague, Netherlands. They had twelve children:\n\nRichmond's interment was at Chichester Cathedral. His wife Sarah survived him by only one year.\n\n"}

Population: \n\nIt is best known for its literary associations. The Russian poet Maximilian Voloshin made it his residence, where he entertained many distinguished guests, including Marina Tsvetayeva, Osip Mandelshtam, and Andrey Bely (who died there). They all wrote remarkable poems in Koktebel. Another prominent literary resident of Koktebel was Ilya Ehrenburg who lived there circa 1919 while escaping from anti-Semitic riots in Kiev.\n\nThe name \"Köktöbel\" is of Turkic origin: in Crimean Tatar it means “Land of the blue hills” (from \"kök\", “sky blue”, and \"töbe\", “hill” or “mountain”, composed with the collective suffix \"-el\"). Its Soviet name of Planerskoye comes from the Russian \"planer\", or glider: the hills above the shoreline were the site of many early experiments in manned heavier-than-air flight by Russian pioneer aviators. The local airfield is still known as Planerskoye. \n\nThe 2003 film of the same name by Boris Khlebnikov and Aleksei Popogrebsky follows the journey of a father and son as they try to reach Koktebel from Moscow.\n\nKoktebel was known as a vacation spot for writers in the Soviet Union. It is also famous for its brandy, its hang-gliding and its naturist beach, largest in the former USSR. \n\nNowadays, Koktebel fills up in the summer with tourists from Russia and until the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea also from Ukraine. Rubles and dollars are readily exchanged in kiosks along the beaches. There is a mixture of public beaches and private beaches with a paved walkway all along the bay. This walkway is lined with small restaurants, cafes, kiosks, and small market areas selling arts and crafts, dried fish, or slices of home-baked cake. In the evening, the beachfront comes alive with many small discos offering music, beer and shashlik. The cuisine is predominantly Tatar but Russian and Ukrainian food is also on offer. There are boat excursions, horse-riding and trips to a nearby monastery or to the cognac factory. Accommodation is either in a small hotel or in one of the hundreds of guesthouses run by local residents. It seems as though the whole population has turned into innkeepers in the summer.\n\nKoktebel is nowadays also well known for its jazz festival that usually takes place in the middle of September. It lures the attention of jazz-lovers from the whole ex-USSR. Cast from the festival in past years included De-Phazz, Nino Katamadze, Stanley Clarke, Billy Cobham and many other famous jazz and world music performers. But the festival's 2014 edition will be held in Zatoka and Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi (both in Odessa Oblast).\n\n"}

This group of five men, personally selected for the final expedition push, attained the Pole on 17 January 1912. The party perished as they attempted to return to the base camp.\n\nEvans was born in Rhossili, Wales, the son of a seaman. He attended St. Helen's Boys School from the age of six until he was thirteen, then enlisted in the Royal Navy in 1891, and in 1899 began service on , where Scott was serving as a torpedo lieutenant.\n\nEdgar Evans then joined Scott's first Antarctic expedition in \"Discovery\" in 1901–1904. Along with William Lashly, he accompanied Scott on his \"Furthest West\" sledge journey to the interior of Victoria Land in 1903.\n\nScott's biographer Roland Huntford described Evans as \"a huge, bull-necked beefy figure\" and a \"beery womanizer\" who was \"running a bit to fat\" by the time of Scott's second expedition in . Evans was nearly left behind in New Zealand when he drunkenly fell into the water while boarding the ship. However, held in high regard by Scott for \"his resourcefulness, his strength and fund of anecdotes,\" Scott decided to overlook the incident.\n\nScott chose Evans as a member of his polar party, with Lieutenant Henry Robertson Bowers, Lawrence Oates, and Edward Adrian Wilson. Scott described Evans as \"a giant worker—he is responsible for every sledge, every sledge-fitting, tents, sleeping-bags, harness, and when one cannot recall a single expression of dissatisfaction with any one of these items, it shows what an invaluable assistant he has been\". Eleven weeks after setting off from base camp, the Polar party reached the South Pole on 17 January 1912, only to discover that Roald Amundsen's five-man party had beaten them to the Pole by five weeks.\n\nTheir return journey soon became a desperate affair. Evans had cut his hand in an accident as they were nearing the pole, and the wound did not heal properly. During the return journey Evans began to deteriorate mentally as well as physically, suffering from frostbite to his fingers, nose and cheeks. As they descended the Beardmore Glacier, he is thought to have suffered a head injury in a fall into a crevasse on 4 February, sustaining a serious concussion which caused his condition to rapidly worsen. During the whole descent his condition delayed the party, and the surplus food gradually diminished.\nOn 16 February 1912, nearing the base of the glacier, Evans collapsed. The next morning, unable to keep up, he was left behind while the others went ahead man-hauling the sledge towards the next supply depot; they had to make a return journey to fetch him. Scott's diary described Evans's condition when they found him; 'He was on his knees, clothing disarranged, hands uncovered and frostbitten and with a \"wild look in his eyes\". He was placed onto a sledge and taken to the camp they had set up. By the time he was placed in the tent, he was comatose. He died in the tent that night. It was not recorded what was done with his body, and none of the other members of the polar party survived the return journey. His widow, Lois (they had married in 1904 and had three children), had a plaque placed, in his memory, in the Norman church at Rhossilli. It reads \"To the Glory of God and in memory of Edgar Evans 1st Class Petty Officer, R.N., and a native of this Parish, who perished on 17 February 1912, when returning from the South Pole with the Southern Party of the British Antarctic Expedition under the command of Captain Robert Falcon Scott, C.V.O., R.N. 'To seek, to strive, to find, and not to yield.'\"\n\nEvans was also remembered at the naval shore establishment on Whale Island, Portsmouth where the Edgar Evans Building was opened in 1964, the first to be named after a petty officer rather than an admiral. The building was demolished in 2010, but a new accommodation block was named after Evans. The new building contains a memorial to him that incorporates two skis he used in Antarctica.\n\nThere is also a commemorative plaque on the Scott lighthouse memorial in Roath Park Lake in Cardiff, South Wales, which lists all of the crew members including Evans. Evans Névé, Victoria Land, is named in honour of Edgar Evans.\n\nIn the film \"Scott of the Antarctic\", Edgar Evans was played by James Robertson Justice. In the Central TV production \"The Last Place on Earth\", Evans was played by Pat Roach, and in BBC Radio 4's \"The Worst Journey in the World\" by Huw Davies.\nEvans is a character in Beryl Bainbridge's novel \"The Birthday Boys\" (1991).\n\n"}

It was made in the UK and Belgium and three series were broadcast on BBC1 between 7 September 1977 and 15 December 1979.\n\nFay Weldon said of the series: \"There is, in the making of such programmes, a level of professionalism, and sheer patient, largely unacclaimed, hard work from producer to script editor to writer to designer to vision mixer to editor by way of sound and lighting engineers that is probably equalled only in a heart transplant theatre\".\n\nLisa Colbert (Jan Francis) runs Lifeline, a Brussels-based resistance organisation that helps Allied aircrew to evade capture and return to Britain via neutral Switzerland or Spain. She is helped by Albert Foiret (Bernard Hepton), proprietor of the \"Cafe Candide\", his mistress Monique Duchamps (Angela Richards) and waitress Natalie Chantrens (Juliet Hammond-Hill).\n\nTheir operations are put under further strain when the fervent Nazi, Gestapo \"Sturmbannführer\" Ludwig Kessler (Clifford Rose) is assigned to work with Luftwaffe Major Erwin Brandt (Michael Culver) and close down the evasion line.\n\nFlight Lieutenant John Curtis (Christopher Neame), a former evader, is sent back by London as a Special Operations Executive liaison officer to coordinate its activity. At first he is greeted with hostility and suspicion; there is also romantic tension between him and Lisa.\n\nSeries One introduces the main characters and the daily risks they take to rescue the young airmen whilst under German occupation, protecting their safe houses and evading investigation. By the end of this series Kessler and Brandt are closing in on Curtis, since their investigation into a murder in France has led them to the name 'Monsieur Maurice', which is Curtis' pseudonym. Brandt and Kessler pay their first visit to the Candide to locate him. Kessler's interest in Curtis poses a significant threat to Lifeline and so it is agreed that Curtis will return to England. Kessler orders a troop encirclement of Brussels to trap him but Curtis manages to escape to Switzerland by posing as bus driver for a local Hitler Youth group that is travelling out of the city on a day trip.\n\nAlbert is having an affair with barmaid Monique Duchamps, while his wife Andrée (Eileen Paige) is bedridden, following an accident two years prior; an out-of-control lorry had ploughed into Albert's car, with Andrée as a passenger. In the final episode of the series Andrée finds out by spotting Monique going into Albert's bedroom. She tries to speak to Albert and gets into her wheelchair for the first time but falls down the stairs and breaks her neck, dying instantly.\n\nOther characters introduced in the first series are:\n\n\nAlbert has sold the Cafe Candide and owns an upper-class black-market restaurant, called the \"Restaurant Candide\", which is prominently located in the Grand-Place. This venture is 60% owned and financed by London, so as to enable the members of Lifeline to cater for senior German officers, to enable them to overhear indiscretions and to provide a better cover for their activities. Albert takes over the running of Lifeline when Lisa is tragically killed in the first episode by Allied bombing, whilst away travelling in occupied France.\n\nThe German officers frequent the new establishment regularly, allowing all the major characters to interact and increasing the dramatic tension. To capitalise on actress Angela Richards' singing talents, Monique performs regularly for the diners, and this becomes a feature of the series. These scenes transform the character of Monique from a dowdy waitress to a sultry chanteuse and provide a contrast to their stressful undercover activities.\n\nSecondary stories include Kessler's developing romance with lonely Belgian 'society woman' Madeleine Duclos (Hazel McBride), whom he meets while dining alone at Le Candide and Brandt being asked to join the conspiracy to assassinate Hitler. Although he declines, he becomes seen as guilty by association. This, and the death of his family in a British air raid on Berlin, results in his suicide, to avoid a court-martial, at the end of the series.\n\nThe series also introduces a new character, restaurant pianist and forger Max Brocard (Stephen Yardley), whose forgery skills are required after the death of Gaston. Max is a Communist infiltrator of Lifeline, responsible for the death of Natalie's boyfriend François (Nigel Williams). Along with other Communist saboteurs, Max is shot dead by the Germans and the civil police whilst taking part in resistance activities, their whereabouts having been tipped off by Albert after he has confirmed that Max is a Communist mole and intends to take over Lifeline. His death leads to terrible repercussions for Albert in the third series.\n\nThis is set during the final weeks of German occupation. Paul Vercors (Michael Byrne and Ralph Bates), the leader and sole survivor of the Communist cell to which Max belonged, begins a conspiracy of revenge against Albert. He lodges an accusation with the authorities that Albert murdered his wife. With Albert in prison for much of the series, responsibility for Lifeline falls to Monique. She becomes increasingly independent and eventually her relationship with Albert collapses, owing to his aloofness and her realising that he is more concerned about money than her. After the Germans severely restrict travel to and from Brussels and the Communists sabotage the main railway line, the evasion lines are closed. The rescued airmen can now only be hidden while they all await the end of the war. With Albert away, Monique and Natalie face accusations of being German collaborators, prostitutes and black-marketeers. As news of the Allied troops' imminent arrival reaches the streets, the Germans find it increasingly difficult to keep order and eventually they leave the Belgians to their own devices.\n\nKessler, promoted to \"Standartenführer\", finds himself in constant conflict with new arrival Major Hans Dietrich Reinhardt (Terrence Hardiman), who has been sent to replace Brandt. The pair clash because Reinhardt can see the desperate situation the Germans face, whereas Kessler remains blinded by patriotism and Nazi ideology. Reinhardt is a cynical and world-weary war hero (he has been awarded the Knight's Cross), whose unorthodox approach is at odds with Kessler's by-the-book methods. Reinhart begins to get results and near the end of the series succeeds in identifying Le Candide as the headquarters of Lifeline.\n\nIn Albert's absence, Lifeline is helped by Major Nicholas \"Nick\" Bradley (Paul Shelley), a charismatic British agent who previously appeared during the second series. Monique resents his presence, believing he threatens her new authority, whereas Natalie has been attracted to Bradley since his earlier visit. Bradley's job is to make sure the remaining evaders are fed and armed to protect themselves whilst they hide in the Ardennes. During his time in Belgium, Bradley succeeds in saving Alain from torture by the Gestapo, blows up a convoy, destroys a V-2 site and discovers where the Germans have laid explosives in the city. Bradley is later shot dead the day before the German withdrawal, being found in the streets after curfew.\n\nWhen the order for German withdrawal is finally given, Kessler tries to escape with his Belgian mistress, Madeleine. Realizing that his capture could lead to execution, Kessler assumes the identity of a lower-ranking officer, shortly before he is captured by British soldiers and put in a prisoner-of-war camp. Rather than evacuate Brussels, Reinhardt satisfies his own curiosity and visits the Candide. As he suspects, he discovers that this has been the headquarters of Lifeline all along. He chooses not to execute Albert, Monique, Alain and Pascal but hands himself over to Albert as his prisoner. At the same time Paul Vercors and his communists arrive and take Albert, Reinhardt and Monique captive. Albert is hanged after a Communist-run 'kangaroo court' finds him guilty of treachery for his part in the death of Max Brocard; just in time, he is cut down and saved by British troops. Monique is captured by Brussels residents and held as a collaborator, waiting to have her head shaved in front of the angry crowds. Natalie and the newly arrived British Captain Stephen Durnford (Stephan Chase) manage to rescue her. Monique and the Captain fall in love and Monique realises that she no longer loves Albert; she decides to marry the captain instead.\n\nHaving been arrested by the British officers who saved Albert, Reinhardt is put in the same camp as Kessler. To protect his new identity and with the grudging support of the senior officers, Kessler engineers a court-martial of Reinhardt for allowing himself to be captured and disobeying the orders of a superior officer. Despite there being only flimsy evidence, Kessler arranges for Reinhardt to be found guilty and he is shot dead by a German firing squad. This scene reflects an actual incident in Amsterdam on 13 May 1945.\n\nAt the same time Kessler's mistress Madeleine bribes Staff Sergeant Dexter (John Ratzenberger) to allow her lover's freedom and the couple escape together. For the members of the evasion line, their happiness is tinged with sadness as they all say goodbye to a tearful Monique, who says her final goodbyes to the Candide and to Albert before starting a new life with her husband. The final episode in the series, 'What Did You Do in the War, Daddy?', was set in 1969 and looked at how the characters had fared after the war. It was never broadcast, perhaps owing to a strike (falsely suggesting that editing was never completed) or the episode's anti-Communist message, or because it was significantly different in tone from the rest of the series. The main themes of the episode were subsequently incorporated into a sequel series, \"Kessler\", which was transmitted in 1981 and explored Kessler's fate.\n\n\"Secret Army\" was created by Gerard Glaister as a follow-up to his drama series \"Colditz\". Glaister was a former RAF pilot and his experiences provided the inspiration for the series. \"Lifeline\" loosely resembled Comet line. The character of John Curtis was influenced by the experiences of the series's technical consultant, Group Captain William Randle, who escaped from occupied Europe in 1942 and was later Keeper of the Battle of Britain Museum.\n\nThe series followed the timeline of the war to show how it affected Belgium. Filming took place in Belgium, with the assistance of BRT. Other locations were in London and Norfolk. The aircraft type that featured throughout the series was the Westland Lysander.\n\nThe title sequence was created by Alan Jeapes, whose credits include \"EastEnders\". The theme music was by Robert Farnon.\n\nThe serious tone of the production led it to be parodied in the BBC comedy series \"'Allo 'Allo!\", with a few cast members appearing in both series.\n\n\nJohn Brason wrote a prequel novel entitled \"Secret Army\", and two novelisations of his episodes entitled \"Secret Army Dossier\" and \"The End of the Line\".\n\nAn unofficial guidebook to the series is available entitled \"The Complete Secret Army\". This features reviews of every episode, information on the real-life events that inspired the series, behind-the-scenes production material, a location guide, and reminiscences and photos from cast and crew. The book is written by \"Secret Army\" fan Andy Priestner, and was published by Classic TV Press in December 2008.\n\nIn 1991 the retailer W H Smith released an exclusive double-tape compilation of seven selected episodes between – and including – the first and last of Series 2, running to 326 minutes in total.\n\nThe complete three series set of \"Secret Army\" is available on DVD (Region 2, UK) from DD Home Entertainment. This also carries interviews with cast members Angela Richards (Monique), Clifford Rose (Kessler), Juliet Hammond-Hill (Natalie), Terrence Hardiman (Reinhardt) and Hazel McBride (Madeleine). It does not include the final unscreened episode (see above).\n\nThe songs performed by Angela Richards and pianist Ken Moule in the series proved so popular with the audience that a BBC soundtrack album entitled \"Au Café Candide\" was released. Long since deleted, the songs are now available on a new CD recorded some 25 years after the first, entitled \"An Evening at Le Candide\". Tracks include Richards's own compositions such as \"Memories Come Gently\" and \"If This Is The Last Time I See You\", together with popular Forties numbers such as \"Lilli Marlene\" and \"J'attendrai\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2295958", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2295958", "title": "Maritzburg College", "text": "Maritzburg College\n\nMaritzburg College is a semi-private English medium high school for boys situated in the city of Pietermaritzburg, in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. It was founded in 1863 and it's the oldest boys' high school in KwaZulu-Natal – and one of the oldest schools in South Africa. It is attended by 1 340 students, of whom approximately 480 are boarders.\n\nMaritzburg College was ranked 4th out of the top 100 best high schools in Africa by Africa Almanac in 2003, based upon quality of education, student engagement, strength and activities of alumni, school profile, internet and news visibility.\n\nMaritzburg College was founded as the Pietermaritzburg High School in 1863, by William Calder, in a carpenter's shop in what is today Langalibalele Street, to accommodate the influx of children arriving at the new city of Pietermaritzburg and its surrounding farmlands in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands. As the school - commonly known as 'College' - swelled, \"the best-trained [architect] in the Colony\", PM Dudgeon, was commissioned to design – on the then outskirts of the city – a larger classroom and boarding block, which was completed in 1888 and later became known as 'Clark House', honouring the school's third headmaster, RD Clark (MA (Oxon)), who is often referred to as ‘the Father of College’. Clark House carries the KwaZulu-Natal provincial heritage authorities' seal certifying it as a heritage landmark. A similar honour was bestowed on the school's Victoria Hall, the building of which commenced in 1897 (Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee year) and which served as a British Army hospital from November 1899 until July 1900 during the Second Boer War.\n\nSince the school's foundation in 1863, the following 15 men have held the post of headmaster of Maritzburg College:\n\n\nThe following men were renowned as schoolmasters at Maritzburg College in the first 100 years of its existence:\n\n\nThe school crest is a red shield with a crossed carbine and assegai (a traditional Zulu weapon), over the Latin scroll bearing \"\" (For Hearth and Home).\n\nThe College colours of red, black and white were first introduced in 1891 by the captain of the school's football team, EJ Holgate. A short while later, Mr RD Clark instituted the school motto (derived from the Latin inscription he composed for the Colonial War Memorial, now in the foyer of Clark House) and the badge of carbine-and-assegai, both of which were initially connected more with the school's Old Boys' Association than the school. An ardent Victorian, Mr Clark was especially proud that 11 of his young school's sons had perished in the valiant colonial struggles 'for hearth and home' (the motto) – hence the school's martial insignia too. Notably, 7 alumni had perished at the bloody Battle of Isandlwana, and one of the school's most prized artefacts is an assegai that had been retrieved from the battlefield in June 1879 and was presented to the school on Founder's Day 2018.\n\nDebate has taken place as to why Holgate chose the combination of red, black and white for the school's colours. A popular belief is that they highlight the various skirmishes, battles and wars between the British and the Zulu that took place in the late 19th century (especially Isandlwana), with the colours representing the warring parties (white and black) and the blood that was shed between them (red).\n\nAlthough Maritzburg College had been a boarding school since its foundation in 1863, the school's system of sports Houses was only introduced in 1902. Initially, a system of four Houses was introduced, with a fifth House – Nathan House – being introduced in 1910. The old Houses were as follows:\n\n\nThe old House system of five sporting Houses was replaced in 2014 with ten new so-called 'day' Houses, each of which meet every morning, have about 130 boys, and form the basis of the school's strong mentoring programme. The Houses are now as follows:\n\n\nThe annual inter-house competition between the 10 Houses sees them compete in over 25 academic, sports, cultural and community-based events for the Forder Cup for Champion House.\n\nThe system of day or sporting Houses is not to be confused with the school's five boarding Houses. To begin with, the sporting and boarding Houses were linked, with the boarders being allocated to Clark's and Langley's sporting Houses (and later Nathan's), and the dayboys to Stalker's and Oxland's. However, since the headmastership of Mr Snow (headmaster 1937-1941), all boys have been allocated randomly to the sports Houses. Thus, a boarder in, say, the Clark House boarding establishment might these days find himself in Nicholson's day House.\n\nThe school's five boarding Houses are:\n\n\nThe school employs 105 teachers on its academic staff - in addition to scores of administrative, estates, additional sports and other support staff. The subjects offered at grade 12 level include accounting, agricultural science, Afrikaans, business studies, dramatic arts, economics, English, geography, engineering & graphic design, history, information technology, life sciences, life orientation, mathematics, mathematical literacy, physical science, visual arts and Zulu. Despite its size and its customary prowess on the sports field, Maritzburg College's academic standards are traditionally strong. At the end of both 2016 and 2017 it was able to boast amongst the best results for a top tier school in the country. In 2016, all 275 of its grade 12 pupils passed the National Senior Certificate, with 95% achieving a university entrance qualification. Four of its boys were placed in the top 20 in the province and eight in the top 20 in the district, in which its matriculants attained the best marks in a number of subjects. The Class of 2017 achieved amongst the school's best results ever, with a 100% pass rate and record 97% of the candidates achieving a university entrance qualification, with H le Roux being placed second in the province.\n\nOne of the school's distinct features is its hierarchical system, which is underpinned by a long-established set of privileges and duties. The most well-known duties include 'team-testing' (the rote-learning of school teams etc. by juniors), 'running' (the carrying out of any errands by Form 2 boys for prefects), 'fagging' (a watered-down version of the old Victorian custom) and 'waiting-at-doors'. School traditions include the wearing by all boys of straw boaters (known as bashers), which are hurled into the air at First XV rugby matches, and the saying of the word 'please' at the end of sentences when a junior is addressing a more senior boy. Because of its possibly contentious nature, the hierarchical system of privileges that underpins the school's ethos is monitored by the school's traditions committee, which is made up of staff, alumni and senior prefects. College's structure of traditions and concepts date back to similar styles found in traditional British boarding schools, and it is perhaps one of the few schools in South Africa where this structure is retained to something like its original extent.\n\nThe first inter-schools cricket and rugby matches were both played against the Deutsche Schule Hermannsburg, on 6 October 1870, with the old Pietermaritzburg High School (now Maritzburg College) winning both fixtures. The cricket match was played in the morning on the Camp Grounds and the rugby match was played in the afternoon on the Pietermaritzburg market square.\n\nMaritzburg College offers a wide variety of sports, including rugby, cricket, canoeing, hockey, athletics, swimming, water polo, tennis, shooting, soccer, basketball, cross-country, squash and golf.\n\nThe school has fixtures against its rival schools such as Durban High School (founded in 1866), Glenwood High School and Westville Boys' High School in and around Durban, and the local private schools, Michaelhouse, Hilton College and Kearsney College. Records show College to be the strongest sporting school in the province in sports such as rugby, cricket, canoeing, polo, polocrosse and hockey.\n\nThe school's search for greater sporting competition has taken it beyond the province's borders, and each year in winter it has derby days against Afrikaanse Hoër Seunskool (known as 'Affies'), Pretoria Boys High School and King Edward VII School (Johannesburg) (known as 'KES') in Gauteng, in which about 700 College boys take part.\n\nFrom 1944 until 1982, the school enjoyed the services of the noted geography master and schoolboy rugby coach, the late Mr Skonk Nicholson, whose name is iconic with Maritzburg College and schoolboy rugby, and who is well respected in the South African rugby community as having nurtured many Collegians to national and international sporting fame. In his 35 seasons in charge of the First XV (rugby), his teams established a playing record of Played 504, Won 403, Drew 49 and Lost 52.\n\nAmongst its many notable Old Boys (known as Old Collegians), it can count (as at April 2018) 298 sporting internationals, including 31 Old Collegians who have captained South African national sides. In addition, Kevin Pietersen captained the England cricket team and Darian Townsend captained the USA swimming team. Four Old Collegians attended the 2004 Olympic Games, with Darian Townsend winning a gold medal as part of the world record-setting SA 4 x 100 freestyle team, and Donovan Cech winning a bronze medal in the rowing; six attended the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, and four attended the 2012 Olympics in London. Six Old Collegians, across hockey, cycling and swimming, were included in the SA team competing in the 2018 Commonwealth Games held on the Gold Coast, Australia.\n\nSaturdays during the summer months can often yield 30 cricket teams (an under 14P XI has occasionally been produced), and up to 29 rugby teams and 21 hockey teams during winter.\n\nMaritzburg College has produced many Old Boys who have distinguished themselves. Amongst its former scholars it can count 11 South African senators, seven generals, two admirals, a Commissioner of Police, eight Officers Commanding of the Natal Carbineers alone, arguably South Africa's pre-eminent English author, two Chancellors of the University of Natal, three Directors of Education, an Emmy Award-winning cameraman, two bishops, a winner of the Polar Medal, a Chief Justice, 10 judges (including a current member of the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein), three Attorneys-General, many Members of Parliament and successful businessmen, and 23 Rhodes scholars.\n\nAs already mentioned, College has produced locally and internationally acclaimed sportsmen, with a tally of 273 international sportsmen to date, and as such is amongst the most produced by a single South African school. Amongst that number are a former Mr USA (bodybuilding), 31 SA captains, 2 overseas captains, 10 captains of polo alone, 6 2008 Olympians, 4 2012 Olympians, and the \"man who won the 2005 Ashes\" for England, Kevin Pietersen. The school's most recent international sportsmen include a trio of young hockey players - Tyson Dlungwana, Tevin Kok and Siyavuya Nolutshungu - a double-international swimmer/life-saver (Martin Binedell) and two cyclists (Brendan Davids and Bradley Potgieter), all of whom will be competing for South Africa at the 2018 Commonwealth Games. Jesse Kriel is a current member of the Springboks, Ryan Moon plays for the SA national soccer team Bafana Bafana, Don Armand enjoyed a second England rugby cap in March 2018, and 'master blaster' David Miller is a world record-holding exponent of limited overs cricket. Another well-known sportsman produced by the school is Andy Birkett, who since he matriculated at the end of 2008 has emerged as one of the country's pre-eminent marathon canoeists, having won the Dusi Canoe Marathon 8 times in the last 9 years and formed one half of the pair who won the 2017 K2 world canoe marathon title. In addition to its 273 international sportsmen, a further 25 Old Collegians have officiated at an international level in sport - including Rugby World Cup rugby referee Craig Joubert, former Test (cricket) umpire Dave Orchard and current Ireland cricket coach Graham Ford.\n\nThe school's Roll of Honour lists the names of 261 former scholars (as at April 2018) who have given their lives in wars since the first Old Collegian casualty fell in 1873 (1863 foundation scholar, Trooper Robert Erskine, who was killed in a skirmish with the Hlubi at Bushman's River Pass). All of their names are displayed on College's numerous war memorials and honours boards, including precisely 100 on the First World War Memorial in front of Clark House and 129 on the honours board in the school chapel that records the names of Old Collegians who died in the Second World War. The most Old Collegians killed in single actions are 11 at the Battle of Delville Wood from 14–20 July 1916 and seven at the famous Battle of Isandlwana (at which over 1,300 British and colonial troops were slaughtered by the Zulus during the Zulu War – a memorial in honour of those fallen Old Boys was unveiled on the battlefield in 1969, on the 90th anniversary of that battle); and at Gelib in Italian Somaliland in 1941, during the infamous 'White Flag Incident' that claimed the lives of 13 Royal Natal Carbineers. A total of 27 alumni died at the Battle of the Somme, which was fought between July and December 1916. Old Collegians have also earned a considerable tally of decorations and awards, especially during the two World Wars – the most recent award being the Distinguished Flying Cross awarded in 2012 to Fl Lt LD Flemington, RAF.\n\n\n"}

It was produced and designed by Noah Falstein. Originally developed for the Atari 8-bit family and the Commodore 64, \"Koronis Rift\" was ported to the Amstrad CPC, Apple II, MSX, Tandy Color Computer 3, and ZX Spectrum.\n\nThe Atari and C64 version shipped on a flippy disk, with one version of the game on each side. A cassette version was also released for the Commodore 64. The Atari version required computers with the GTIA chip installed in order to display properly.\n\n\"Koronis Rift\" was one of two games in Lucasfilm Games' second wave (December 1985). The other was \"The Eidolon\". Both enhanced the fractal technology developed for \"Rescue on Fractalus!\". In \"Koronis Rift\", the Atari 8-bit family's additional colors (over those of the Commodore 64) allowed the programmers to gradually fade in the background rather than it suddenly popping in as in \"Rescue\", an early example of depth cueing in a computer game.\n\nThe player controls a surface rover vehicle to enter several \"rifts\" on an alien planet which are effectively fractal mazes. A lost civilisation known as the Ancients has left strange machinery, so-called \"hulks\", within these rifts which are guarded by armed flying saucers of different design and color. Depending on their respective color, shields and gunshots of both the rover and the saucers are of varying effectiveness against each other; part of the game is figuring out which shield and weapon modules work best where.\n\nBy means of a drone robot, the rover can retrieve modules with various functions (which are not immediately obvious) from nearby hulks. It can only be deployed when all attacking Guardian Saucers have been destroyed. The modules can then be installed in the rover, analyzed aboard the player's space ship, or sold; the rover can carry up to six different modules at a time which can be activated and de-activated as the player sees fit. A large variety of modules is available: Different weapon and shield modules with varying power levels and color codes, modules that increase the rover's power output, a mapper (activating an extra screen on the rover), and even one module that turns the retrieval probe into a bomb, destroying any hulks the probe is sent to investigate instead of retrieving modules.\n\nConversely, different types of hulks exist including one that simply \"swallows\" the probe without yielding a module, requiring the player to purchase a new probe (and possibly sell useful modules to raise the required funds).\n\nThe goal of the game is to find and destroy the saucer control base hulk which is located in the 20th rift. To this end, the player must explore the rifts, find hulks, retrieve and analyze modules and understand the color-coding of weapons and shields to overcome the increasingly aggressive and dangerous saucers.

He was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford. His interest in engineering started while he was at university and afterwards he was apprenticed to Bentley Motors. He began a motor racing career in 1929 when he took part in the JCC High Speed Trial. In the next year he became a member of the Austin team and won the Brooklands 500 Miles. He created his own team of MG Midgets in 1931 and won the Brooklands Double Twelve race, but then became more involved in the organisational side of motor sport.\n\nHe inherited the Dukedoms in 1935, along with the Goodwood Estate and the racecourse. Death duties meant he had to sell the family interests in Scotland, including Gordon Castle, and settle on the Goodwood Estate near Chichester. He designed and flew his own aircraft and served with the Royal Air Force during World War II. For a time he was based in Washington, working for the Ministry of Aircraft Production.\n\nAfter the war he faced the task of rehabilitating Goodwood, and saw the potential for creating a motor racing circuit from the fighter station built at Goodwood during the Second World War. Horse racing was an important part of the Goodwood scene, but he did not share his ancestors' interest in the sport. The Goodwood Circuit became an important venue in motor racing. However, by 1966 the Duke was concerned at the increasing risks involved in motor racing and closed the circuit except for minor club activities and private testing.\n\nThe Duke was the longest-serving Vice President of the Royal Automobile Club, with which he was associated since 1948. As early as the thirties, he was the motoring correspondent of the \"Sunday Referee\", and became the Founder President of the Guild of Motoring Writers.\n\nThe Duke appeared on the 14 December 1958 episode of the American version of \"What's My Line?\".\n\nHe married Elizabeth Grace Hudson (1900–1992) on 15 December 1927. She was the daughter of Rev. Thomas William Hudson and his wife, Alethea Matheson, and sister of Bishop Noel Hudson. They were married for sixty-one years and had two children:\n\n\n"}

Paul Getty Trust included in the Getty Vocabulary Program. The TGN includes names and associated information about places. Places in TGN include administrative political entities (e.g., cities, nations) and physical features (e.g., mountains, rivers). Current and historical places are included. Other information related to history, population, culture, art and architecture is included. \n\nThe resource is available to museums, art libraries, archives, visual resource collection catalogers, bibliographic projects through private license or available to members of the general public for free on the Getty Vocabulary website (see external links).\n\nThe Getty vocabulary databases (Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT), Union List of Artist Names (ULAN), and TGN) are produced and maintained by the Getty Vocabulary Program. They are compliant with ISO and NISO standards for thesaurus construction. They contain terms, names, and other information about people, places, things, and concepts relating to art, architecture, and material culture.\n\nThe Getty vocabularies can be used in three ways: at the data entry stage, by catalogers or indexers who are describing works of art, architecture, material culture, archival materials, visual surrogates, or bibliographic materials; as knowledge bases, providing information for researchers; and as search assistants to enhance end-user access to online resources.\n\nWork on the TGN began in 1987, when the Getty created a department dedicated to compiling and distributing terminology, at that time called the Vocabulary Coordination Group. The AAT was already being managed by the Getty at that time, and the Getty attempted to respond to requests from the creators of art information for additional controlled vocabularies for artists' names (ULAN) and geographic names (TGN). The development of TGN was informed by an international study completed by the Thesaurus Artis Universalis (TAU), a working group of the Comité International d'Histoire de l'Art (CIHA), and by the consensus reached at a colloquium held in 1991, attended by the spectrum of potential users of geographic vocabulary in cataloging and scholarship of art and architectural history and archaeology. The initial core of the TGN was compiled from thousands of geographic names in use by various Getty cataloging and indexing projects, enlarged by information from U. S. government databases, and further enhanced by the manual entry of information from published hard-copy sources. The TGN grows and changes via contributions from the user community and editorial work of the Getty Vocabulary Program.\n\nThe basic principles under which the TGN is constructed and maintained were established by the Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT) and also employed for the Union List of Artist Names (ULAN): Its scope includes terminology needed to catalog and retrieve information about the visual arts and architecture; it is constructed using national and international standards for thesaurus construction; it comprises a hierarchy with tree structures corresponding to the current and historical worlds; it is based on terminology that is current, warranted for use by authoritative literary sources, and validated by use in the scholarly art and architectural history community; and it is compiled and edited in response to the needs of the user community.\n\nTGN was founded under the management of Eleanor Fink (head of what was then called the Vocabulary Coordination Group, and subsequently Director of the Art History Information Program, later called the Getty Information Institute). TGN has been constructed over the years by numerous members of the user community and an army of dedicated editors, under the supervision of several managers. Technical support for the TGN was provided by the Getty. TGN was first published in 1997 in machine-readable files. Given the growing size and frequency of changes and additions to the TGN, hard-copy publication was deemed to be impractical. It is currently published in both a searchable online Web interface and in data files available for licensing. The data for the TGN is compiled and edited in an editorial system that was custom-built by Getty technical staff to meet the unique requirements of compiling data from many contributors, building complex and changing polyhierarchies, merging, moving, and publishing in various formats. Final editorial control of the TGN is maintained by the Getty Vocabulary Program, using well-established editorial rules. The current managers of the TGN are Patricia Harpring, Managing Editor, and Murtha Baca, Head, Vocabulary Program and Digital Resource Management.\n\nTGN is available as Linked Open Data since August 2014.\n\nTGN is a structured vocabulary currently containing around 1,106,000 names and other information about places. Names for a place may include names in the vernacular language, English, other languages, historical names, names and in natural order and inverted order. Among these names, one is flagged as the preferred name.\n\nTGN is a thesaurus, compliant with ISO and NISO standards for thesaurus construction; it contains hierarchical, equivalence, and associative relationships. Note that TGN is not a GIS (Geographic Information System). While many records in TGN include coordinates, these coordinates are approximate and are intended for reference only.\n\nThe focus of each TGN record is a place. There are around 912,000 places in the TGN. In the database, each place record (also called a subject) is identified by a unique numeric ID. Linked to the record for the place are names, the place's parent or position in the hierarchy, other relationships, geographic coordinates, notes, sources for the data, and place types, which are terms describing the role of the place (e.g., inhabited place and state capital). The temporal coverage of the TGN ranges from prehistory to the present and the scope is global.\n\nThe TGN is a faceted classification system as well as a poly-hierarchical one. There are two facets: World and Extraterrestrial. Within the World facet are Physical Features and Political Entities. One can view administrative places from as broad as continents and regions to as specific as neighborhoods, boroughs, towns, and cities. Within the Physical Features facets are mountain ranges, oceans, seas, rivers, waterfalls, island groups, and deserts.\n\nThe record for each concept includes its place in the hierarchy (with a link to its parent), as well as links to related terms, related concepts, sources for the data, and notes.\n\n\n"}

The series is set on a Kentucky horse farm soon after the American Civil War. Cullen's character of Ned Logan is the 42-year-old widowed patriarch of the family. The series focuses on domestic and romantic crises, such as the arrival of 17-year-old orphan Jeremy, and Sean Logan's interracial affair with the daughter of a former slave.\n\nA family-run horse farm nestled among the rolling bluegrass country provides the picturesque backdrop for \"Legacy\", a family drama series that chronicles the proud and close-knit Logan family as they struggle to maintain their deep-seated family values of hard work and integrity in a society increasingly driven by money, power, and self-indulgence.\n\nMy grandfather came to this country 100 years ago and built an incredible life for his family out of nothing. This land means everything to us... He left us a legacy – to give others less fortunate than we are a chance to turn their lives around.\" – Ned Logan.\n\nIn \"Legacy\", Ned seeks to pass on the \"legacy\" of his Irish ancestors – to build a solid foundation of love and support for his family while giving others less fortunate a chance to make better lives for themselves. Beyond stables of horses and acres of farmland, Ned must keep sight of his family, whose lofty ambitions, romantic entanglements, and mischievous adventures ensure the Logans notoriety within social circles. Eldest son Sean (Grayson McCouch) is a handsome, charismatic young man with a promising future and a secret love that could threaten his dreams; Clay (Jeremy Vincent Garrett), the passionate, yet hot-tempered son, who often feels that his father's compassion for others does not extend to him; Alice (Lea Moreno), an upright and conflicted teenager forced by her mother's death to play the maternal role in the family, but still searching for her own identity; and Lexy (Sarah Rayne), the youngest and most willful of the offspring, who often demonstrates wisdom beyond her years.\n\nAdding drama to the family's already delicate balance is Jeremy (Ron Melendez), a street-wise and troubled 17 year-old orphan from New York who is taken in by Ned Logan. With a history of dishonesty and petty crime, Jeremy finds himself a fish out of water as he builds both relationships and rifts with the rest of the family.\n\n\n\nThough set near Lexington, Kentucky, \"Legacy\" was filmed by Atlantis Films Limited near Charles City, Virginia. The theme song for the series is from \"The Mummers' Dance\" by Loreena McKennitt.\n\n"}

He previously played for England.\n\nVoyce married Anna Wood in September 2015.\n\nBorn 5 January 1981 in Truro, Cornwall.\n\nVoyce's great uncle, Anthony Thomas Voyce, won 27 caps for England, while playing for Gloucester Rugby, during the 1920s and was a member of the first double Grand Slam winning team. He went on to become President of the RFU in 1960–61.\n\nVoyce was educated at Penair School, Truro and then studied at King's College, Taunton.\n\nOutside the rugby field, Voyce is an Ambassador of the Wooden Spoon Society.\n\nHe first showed promise playing mini rugby at Penryn RFC in his native Cornwall, before going on to play for Truro RFC U15s and U16s.\n\nHaving left Cornwall at 16, he eventually joined Bath where he worked his way through the club's lower sides and into the Zurich Premiership line up. At the same time he established himself in the England Under 21 side. He was selected for England's 2001 tour to North America, where he won his first cap against the USA.\n\nIn 2003 he moved to London, to join Wasps for the 2003–04 season and quickly established himself as a first team regular. He played in 34 of his club's 35 matches that season, scoring 15 tries in the process. At the end of the season Wasps won the Premiership final against his former club Bath. He also helped Wasps win the Heineken Cup that season. In November 2004 he scored the quickest try in Premiership history when he gathered a loose ball from kick off and crossed by the posts in 9.63 seconds against Harlequins, beating Martin Corry's record by 14 seconds. Voyce was in the starting line up for the 2004 England summer tour matches against New Zealand in Auckland and Australia in Brisbane. He helped Wasps win their third consecutive Premiership title in 2005, this time scoring a try in the final against Leicester.\n\nIn 2005 he marked his first Twickenham Test appearance with two tries against Samoa.\n\nVoyce was selected for every match of the 2006 Six Nations Championship. Initially selected for the bench in England's opener against Wales, Voyce quickly found himself on the pitch replacing injured Josh Lewsey, also scoring a try in the process. This injury meant that Voyce secured the number 15 jersey for the next game against Italy. However, Lewsey was soon fit again in time for the 3rd game, which meant that Voyce was once again relegated to the bench. After losing two games in a row, changes were made to the England squad meaning England regular Lewsey was dropped, opening up the fullback position for Voyce to start against Ireland. Later that year, he played his last international to date against Australia, in Sydney. His performance in such game was – according to himself – quite poor, and this might have jeopardised his international career.\n\nVoyce won his second Heineken Cup with Wasps in 2007.\n\nIn March 2009, it was announced that he would join Gloucester Rugby from the 2009–10 season.\n\nApril 2012, departure from Gloucester announced.\n\nIn October 2012, he joined London Welsh.

{"id": "2296032", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2296032", "title": "In the Wake of Determination", "text": "In the Wake of Determination\n\nIn the Wake of Determination is the second studio album by American rock band Story of the Year. The album is much heavier sounding than their debut album \"Page Avenue\".\n\nStory of the Year released their debut album \"Page Avenue\" in September 2003 through major label Maverick Records. The album, which was produced by John Feldmann, received substantial airplay at radio and video outlets. By April 2004, the album was certified gold in the US. Vocalist Dan Marsala said the success of the album \"started to get to all of us ... [We] got lumped in with all of these new bands ... that aren't really that good\". Marsala became critical of Feldmann, stating that Feldmann \"originally changed our sound. All of his records have the same sort of sound\".\n\nIn July 2004, MTV reported that the group would start recording their next album in January 2005. In August, Marsala said the group were working on new material. After the touring cycle for \"Page Avenue\" concluded in late 2004, the group immediately began writing for their second album. Most of the writing sessions took place at guitarist Ryan Phillips' house, which also acted as a practice area. The writing sessions consisted of the group jamming eight hours a day for five days a week. Demos were recorded with Mbox and drum machine software.\n\nOpting not to work with Feldmann again, the group brought in Steve Evetts to produce. Marsala said one of the reasons they chose Evetts was due to him producing some of Marsala's favorite albums. Marsala added that Evetts let the group have free rein in regards to doing whatever they wanted. The group wanted to capture their live sound, which Marsala said was a bit heavier than what was heard on \"Page Avenue\". In late March, they started pre-production, which lasted into mid-April. Following this, they began recording drums at Gravity Studios in Chicago, Illinois. Here, the group performed alongside drummer Josh Wills while he tracked drums.\n\nIn late April, sessions moved to Phillips' personal studio, The Steamy Nook in St Louis, Missouri. Phillips reasoned that it was better to do it at home since they would have more time to record, since travelling wouldn't be a factor. They began tracking guitars until early May. Phillips tracked his guitar solos in a single day, and by the end, \"there was skin hanging off all of my fingers and I could barely bend the strings anymore.\" Evetts engineered the sessions with assistance from Allan Hessler. The recordings were mixed by Evetts at Bay 7 in Valley Glen, California, before being mastered by Tom Baker at Precision Mastering.\n\n\"In the Wake of Determination\" drew comparison to Thrice, with Marsala's voice recalling Bad Religion frontman Greg Graffin. Discussing the title, Marsala said: \"[W]e knew exactly what we wanted to do, and we knew how we wanted to come across. We were just really determined ... That was our mindset the entire time.\" All of the music and lyrics were written by the band. After the music was written, Marsala and bassist Adam Russell would get together and fit the lyrics to it. On some occasions, Marsala would bring a lot of lyrics that required minor tweaking. On other occasions, the pair would be in a room for hours before coming up with a line. Throughout the process, some of the members were worried about living up to the expectations of \"Page Avenue\". For this album, Phillips focused on making his solos complement the song, fit within the structure, and come across as more melodic. On the demos, Phillips' solos featured tapping and shredding, something that he realized was due to simply wanting \"gnarly solos.\"\n\n\"We Don't Care Anymore\" was one of the last songs written for the album. Marsala said the song was about \"doing things for yourself, not for the approval of others.\" According to Phillips, the track was a result of an agreement between him and his girlfriend: \"I got all pissed off, got up, opened up Pro-tools, and started recording shit. By 6 am I had the entire song recorded.\" \"Take Me Back\" drew comparison to \"Siren Song of the Counter Culture\" (2004)-era Rise Against. It talks about growing up and learning how ignorance is bliss. Russell claimed half of the lyrics happened by accident, due to him and Marsala writing a few pages of lyrics about the same topic. According to Phillips, the song's initial iteration \"didn't work\", so the group re-worked it until it evolved into a \"full on rock tune.\"\n\nWith \"Our Time Is Now\", Marsala aimed to write a positive song that \"made people want to get up off their ass and do something\". The track bounces between the groove metal and punk rock styles; Marsala took inspiration from his favorite hardcore punk albums. Marsala said \"Taste the Poison\" was about \"any kind of addiction.\" He explained: \"I've seen a lot of friends let things consume them and in the long run it ends up ruining everything they've worked for.\" The track originally ran for over 6 minutes, however, when the group tried working on it, they initially had no success with it. Marsala wrote the majority of lyrics for \"Stereo\" while on a plane. He said it was about the state of the music industry and how people in it were focused on making money instead of enjoying the music they write. Russell said the track had \"all the cool elements\" of \"Page Avenue\" mixed in with \"more intensity and heaviness.\"\n\n\"Five Against the World\" originally had a different chorus, which Marsala said \"just wasn't strong enough\" compared to the verses. They came up with another chorus for it during recording. Marsala said the track was about how far they've progressed as a group. Phillips was inspired to write the song after watching \"Cocktail\" (1988). Russell said it had elements of Pantera, Foo Fighters, Boston and hardcore punk. \"Sleep\" was nearly left off the album. Guitarist Philip Sneed said the track lacked vocals and the structure needed work. After choosing all of the songs intended for the album, Phillips showed some unused demos to Evetts. Upon hearing the one for \"Sleep\", he insisted that it be recorded. The group subsequently rewrote it. \"Meathead\" displays the band's hardcore punk origins; the music for it was written six months before lyrics were added. Marsala was struggling with what to write about for it until he and Russell \"realized that we needed a song about tough guy assholes.\"\n\n\"March of the Dead\" was the first track the group worked on for the album. Marsala said the track is \"just encouraging people not to be lead blindly into any situation.\" It originally featured several time signatures and tempo changes until the group worked on it during pre-production. The chorus initially existed as four separate ideas that were combined into one. With \"Pay Your Enemy\", Marsala wanted to write \"a good heavy sing along\" track. The guitar riff in the bridge was taken from a \"Page Avenue\" outtake. Marsala was hesitant with \"Wake Up the Voiceless\" when Phillips showed him the track as he thought it sounded more like Survivor. Wills said the song had an \"Eye of the Tiger\"-feel to it. \"\"Is This My Fate?\" He Asked Them\" tackles the theme of discrimination against the LGBT community. Phillips came up with the main riff for it when he was jamming with a friend of his. Russell, who normally did not write music, came up with the riff in the chorus. The album's hidden track \"A Silent Murder / Slow Jam\" was conceived as the intro for \"Taste the Poison\". Phillips said it was split into separate tracks after Marsala tracked \"this awesome melody\" over it.\n\nOn July 22, 2005, \"In the Wake of Determination\" was announced for release in October, and \"We Don't Care Anymore\" was posted on the group's Myspace profile. \"Our Time Is Now\" was posted on Myspace on August 2. The group performed on the Warped Tour between August 3 and 15. \"We Don't Care Anymore\" was released to radio on August 16. On the same day, \"Take Me Back\" was posted on the band's Myspace. Around this time, a music video was filmed for \"We Don't Care Anymore\". It was shot on a Los Angeles soundstage with director Kevin Kerslake. On August 27, the album's track listing and artwork were revealed. A few people came up with ideas for the artwork, which the group were hesitant to go with. As a result, Phillips and Russell created the final artwork.\n\nIn September and October, the group went on a US tour with Funeral for a Friend, Anberlin and He Is Legend. To coincide with the tour, the \"We Don't Care Anymore\" music video was released. Between September 22 and the album's release, the group uploaded behind-the-scenes clips taken during the recording process. \"In the Wake of Determination\" was released on October 11 through Maverick Records. The iTunes edition included the bonus track \"Unheard Voices\". Throughout the week, the group performed songs from it on Fuse's \"7th Avenue Drop\" program. In October and November, the band performed on the International Taste of Chaos tour which visited Mexico, Australia, Japan, the UK and Germany. The band did a number of radio shows, and some headlining shows with support from Stretch Arm Strong, in December.\n\nIn January 2006, the group went tour with Every Time I Die, From First to Last, He Is Legend and Adair. \"Take Me Back\" was released to radio on January 17. Two days later, a music video was released for the track. From February to April, the band went on the 2006 Taste of Chaos North American tour; they were replaced by Thursday for the Canadian dates. Also in April, the band went on tour of the UK with Stretch Arm Strong and Bleed the Dream. To coincide with this, \"Take Me Back\" was released as a CD single with live versions of \"Until the Day I Die\" and \"And the Hero Will Drown\" as B-sides.

She was the second of three s, in addition to her two sister-ships and . Named for Frederick the Great, she was laid down at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel in 1871 and completed in 1877. Her main battery of four guns was mounted pair of twin gun turrets amidships.\n\n\"Friedrich der Grosse\" served with the fleet from her commissioning until 1896, though she was frequently placed in reserve throughout her career. The ship was a regular participant in the annual fleet training maneuvers conducted with the exception of the mid-1880s, when she was temporarily replaced by newer vessels. She participated in several cruises in the Baltic and Mediterranean Seas, often escorting Kaiser Wilhelm II on official state visits. The ship was removed from active service in 1896, after which she was used in secondary roles until 1919, when she was stricken from the naval register and sold to a scrapyard. \"Friedrich der Grosse\" was broken up for scrap the following year.\n\nThe three \"Preussen\"-class ironclads were authorized under the naval program of 1867, which had been approved by the \"Reichstag\" to strengthen the North German Federal Navy in the wake of the Second Schleswig War, when the weak, then-Prussian Navy had been unable to break the blockade imposed by the Danish Navy. Initially ordered as casemate ships, the vessels were re-designed as turret ships; they were the first uniform class of ironclads built by for the German fleet.\n\n\"Friedrich der Grosse\" was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of forward. \"Friedrich der Grosse\" was powered by one 3-cylinder single expansion steam engine, which was supplied with steam by six coal-fired transverse trunk boilers. The ship's top speed was , at . She was also equipped with a full ship rig. Her standard complement consisted of 46 officers and 454 enlisted men.\n\nShe was armed with four L/22 guns mounted in a pair of gun turrets placed amidships. As built, the ship was also equipped with two L/25 chase guns. After being rebuilt in 1888–1890, her armament was increased by six and later ten L/30 quick-firing guns, a pair of machine guns, and five torpedo tubes, all placed in the ship's hull below the waterline. \n\n\"Friedrich der Grosse\"s armor was made of wrought iron and backed with teak. The armored belt was arrayed in two strakes. The upper strake was thick; the lower strake ranged in thickness from . Both were backed with of teak. The gun turrets were protected by armor on the sides, backed by 260 mm of teak.\n\n\"Friedrich der Grosse\" was ordered by the Imperial Navy from the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel; her keel was laid in 1871 under construction number 1. The ship was launched on 20 September 1874 and commissioned into the German fleet on 22 November 1877. Although laid down a year before her sister , \"Friedrich der Grosse\" was not completed until a year after; this was because she was built at a newly established and inexperienced Imperial Dockyard, while \"Preussen\" was built by AG Vulcan, an experienced private shipbuilder. The ship cost the German government 7,303,000 gold marks.\n\nAfter her commissioning in November 1877, \"Friedrich der Grosse\" served with the fleet. In April 1878, \"Friedrich der Grosse\" was reactivated to participate in the annual summer fleet maneuvers, under the command of \"Konteradmiral\" (Rear Admiral} Carl Ferdinand Batsch. Her newly commissioned sister-ship, , joined the squadron shortly before maneuvers were scheduled to begin. At the time, \"Friedrich der Grosse\" suffered from mechanical problems, and on 22 May, she ran aground off Nyborg while steaming from Kiel to Wilhelmshaven. The ship suffered serious damage to her hull, which, coupled with her chronic engine problems, forced her to miss the fleet maneuvers. While the squadron steamed in the English Channel on 31 May, the armored frigate accidentally rammed \"Grosser Kurfürst\"; the latter quickly sank with the loss of 276 men.\n\nIn the aftermath of the loss of \"Grosser Kurfürst\", the Navy canceled the summer 1878 maneuvers. Apart from the small ironclad , all armored warships were put in reserve until the following year. In May 1879, the armored squadron was reactivated, under the command of \"Konteradmiral\" Franz Kinderling. \"Friedrich der Grosse\" and \"Preussen\" were joined by the older ironclads and ; the squadron remained in the Baltic for the majority of the training period. Kinderling took his four ships out into the North Sea in June for a visit to Norway. The four ships returned to Kiel in September, when the squadron was disbanded for the winter.\n\nIn the spring of 1880, the squadron was again reestablished. The new armored corvette replaced \"Kronprinz\" in the squadron that year. Wilhelm von Wickede, a former Austrian naval officer, replaced Kinderling as the squadron commander. In June, the Italian screw corvette visited the armored squadron in Kiel. Again, the squadron remained in the Baltic for the summer cruise, with the exception of a short visit to Wilhelmshaven and Cuxhaven in August. The summer cruise in 1881 followed the same pattern as the year previous, though \"Kronprinz\" returned in place of \"Sachsen\", which was plagued with engine problems. Wickede again served as the commander. In July, the ships hosted a visit by the British reserve squadron, which by this time included the first British ironclad, . \"Preussen\" and the rest of the squadron visited Danzig in September during a meeting between Kaiser Wilhelm I and the Russian Tsar Alexander III.\n\nThe 1882 summer cruise included the same four ironclads from the previous year, and was again commanded by Wickede, who had by then been promoted to \"Konteradmiral\". \"Friedrich der Grosse\" was kept in reserve during the annual summer maneuvers starting in 1883, as new ships, including the rest of the s entered service. From 1883 to 1885, the ship underwent a modernization that included new boilers and a reconstructed poop deck. Two Hotchkiss guns and five torpedo tubes were added in above-water mounts. The ship was reactivated in July 1888 to participate in a tour of the Baltic for the newly enthroned Kaiser Wilhelm II. The voyage included visits to St. Petersburg, Stockholm, and Copenhagen. They met Tsar Alexander III and the Swedish King Oscar II, who inspected the German warships and conferred decorations on the senior officers.\n\nIn August 1889, \"Friedrich der Grosse\" participated in Kaiser Wilhelm II's visit to Great Britain. The ship was assigned to II Division, along with her sister \"Preussen\" and the central battery ironclads and , under command of \"Konteradmiral\" Friedrich Hollmann. The fleet then conducted maneuvers in the North Sea before returning to Germany. \"Friedrich der Grosse\" and the rest of II Division became the training squadron for the fleet in 1889–1890, the first year the Kaiserliche Marine maintained a year-round ironclad force. The squadron escorted Wilhelm II's imperial yacht to the Mediterranean; the voyage included state visits to Italy and the Ottoman Empire. The squadron remained in the Mediterranean until April 1890, when it returned to Germany.\n\n\"Friedrich der Grosse\" participated in the ceremonial transfer of the island of Helgoland from British to German control in the summer of 1890. She was present during the fleet maneuvers in September, where the entire eight-ship armored squadron simulated a Russian fleet blockading Kiel. II Division, including \"Friedrich der Grosse\", served as the training squadron in the winter of 1890–1891. The squadron again cruised the Mediterranean, under the command of \"Konteradmiral\" Wilhelm Schröder. \"Friedrich der Grosse\" again saw service in II Division in the winter of 1891–1892 and the 1892 maneuvers, under the command of \"Konteradmiral\" Hans von Koester.\n\nThe ship participated in the 1893 maneuvers, which included a simulation of a French naval attack in the North Sea. The following year, \"Friedrich der Grosse\", \"König Wilhelm\", and \"Deutschland\" joined the new battleship as re-designated II Division of the Maneuver Squadron, under the command of \"Konteradmiral\" Otto von Diederichs. The ships simulated a Russian attack on Germany's Baltic coast in the 1894 maneuvers. She was reduced to a harbor ship on 16 November 1896. The ship was stricken from the active register on 21 May 1906, after which she was used as a coal hulk for torpedo boats. \"Friedrich der Grosse\" served in this capacity until after the end of World War I; she was removed from the naval register on 27 January 1919. She was sold to shipbreakers and broken up for scrap the following year in Rönnebeck.\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\n"}

It was directed by Mike Mitchell, and written by Paul Hernandez, Robert Schooley, and Mark McCorkle. The film stars Kelly Preston, Michael Angarano, Danielle Panabaker, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and Kurt Russell. It tells the story about the son of two superheroes who is enrolled in a superhero school where his powers kick in.\n\nWill Stronghold begins ninth grade at Sky High, a high school that exclusively teaches teenagers with superpowers. Will's parents are The Commander and Jetstream, two of the world's most famous superheroes. Will's best friend, Layla Williams, who happens to have a crush on him, has the power to manipulate plant life. Will is anxious about attending Sky High, located on a floating campus reached by a flying school bus, because, unbeknownst to his parents, he has not developed any super powers.\n\nOn the first day, he and the other ninth graders are harrassed by a trio of bullies: Speed, a burly senior with super speed, Lash, a skinny senior with extreme flexibility, and Penny Lent, a senior cheerleader who has the ability to duplicate herself. Because of his lack of powers, Will is assigned to a curriculum for \"Hero Support\" and becomes a sidekick by Coach Boomer. His classmates include Ethan, who melts into a fluid; Zach, who glows in the dark; Magenta, who transforms into a guinea pig; and Layla, who joins the class in protest of the two-track nature of the school's education system. The class is taught by The Commander's former sidekick, \"All American Boy\".\n\nWill learns from Nurse Spex that not everybody gets powers, and there are rare cases of those who have both parents with superpowers but do not inherit any superpowers, such as the bus driver, Ron Wilson. The Commander is unaware that his son has been relegated to Hero Support and shows Will his hidden trophy room, which he calls his \"secret sanctum\". He is particularly proud of the mysterious weapon, \"The Pacifier\", which he took from his science-themed nemesis Royal Pain years ago. Unknown to the two, Royal Pain, who has been presumed dead, watches them from a hidden camera in one of the other trophies, alongside a maniacal sidekick named Stitches.\n\nAs Will settles into Sky High and makes friends with the other sidekicks, he comes into conflict with pyrokinetic student Warren Peace, whose supervillain father was imprisoned by The Commander. During a fight between the two, Will eventually manifests super strength, impressing Gwen Grayson, a beautiful and popular technopath who controls machines with her mind. Will is subsequently transferred to the \"Hero\" track, and inevitably becomes popular and unable to hang out with his Hero Support friends.\n\nGwen visits the Stronghold's house and asks Will's parents to attend the Homecoming Dance to accept an award for Superhero of the Year, which they accept. Later on, while walking to her house, Gwen asks Will out to Homecoming and, to his delight, becomes his girlfriend. Will then begins spending more time with Gwen and her clique of friends, ignoring the sidekicks and Layla, who reveals to Warren that she has loved Will for a long time.\n\nOn the night before the dance, Gwen tricks Will into throwing a party at his house and, as Will takes her to his father's secret sanctum, Gwen has Speed steal the Pacifier. After Gwen lies to Layla, who shows up to investigate the noise and believes the lie, Will breaks up with Gwen, refusing to attend the dance, even though his parents were invited as honored guests. Later, he looks through his father's old yearbook and sees a student who resembles Gwen holding the Pacifier, which he subsequently discovers has gone missing. Believing that the student, Sue Tenny, is Royal Pain, and that Gwen is her daughter, he rushes to the dance.\n\nAt the dance party, Gwen reveals that she is in fact Royal Pain herself. During her previous confrontation with the Commander, the Pacifier, which is meant to turn its target into an infant, malfunctioned, turning her into a baby instead, inadvertently faking her alleged death. Raised by Stitches, she has since waited 17 years for revenge. With the help of Stitches and the school bullies, Gwen takes over the school, uses the Pacifier to turn Will's parents, the faculty, and students into babies, and plans to turn it into a supervillain academy and raise them as supervillains.\n\nAfter returning to school, Will apologizes to Layla and teams up with Warren, the sidekicks, and Ron Wilson to save the day. The sidekicks demonstrate their heroism after Royal Pain sabotages the school's anti-gravity drive and their powers come in handy restarting it. Meanwhile, Will discovers that he has Jetstream's powers of flight when he is thrown off the edge of the school grounds and prevents the campus from falling using his two abilities.\n\nRoyal Pain and her henchmen are defeated and imprisoned in the detention halls. Will's parents, the faculty, and students are returned to their proper ages. His parents thank all of the sidekicks and admit they are heroes. Warren develops a love relationship with Freeze Girl. Will and Layla kiss, and a voiceover by Will at the end reveals that he and Layla have become a couple, he and Warren became best friends, he and Gwen became archenemies, and Ron Wilson gained superhuman powers after falling into a vat of toxic waste, thus becoming a superhero.\n\n\nExterior shots of the Sky High school were filmed at the Oviatt Library at California State University in Northridge.\n\nIn between working on the first and second seasons of the animated series \"Kim Possible\", creators Bob Schooley and Mark McCorkle had begun writing a script for a live-action adaptation, which ultimately never came to fruition due to unknown reasons. Impressed with their work, the filmmakers asked them to look into re-writing the script for \"Sky High\", which had been previously shelved. McCorkle believes they were recruited for \"Sky High\" because \"they liked the idea of a superhero high school. I think, reading how we wrote teens in \"Kim Possible\", they felt like, 'This feels good and contemporary, and maybe you can apply that to this project for us.' Similar to \"Kim Possibl\"e, Schooley and McCorkle wrote \"Sky High\" to be equally appealing to both children and adults. According to scifi.com, Disney was attracted by the \"original concept\" of \"children of superheroes going to high school\", originally conceived by screenwriter Paul Hernandez in the 1990s.\n\nAfter recruiting comedy writers (creators of \"Kim Possible\") for polishing Hernandez's script (they only wrote the beginning and ending sequences) Disney hired several comedians such as Kevin McDonald, Dave Foley, and Kevin Heffernan for supporting roles. For the main roles, the casting was a mix of established and new teenager actors: while Michael Angarano and Mary Elizabeth Winstead were already successful, Danielle Panabaker was little-known and Steven Strait (a former model) was hired after his first audition ever.\n\nDirector Mike Mitchell said that Sky High functions on two premises: \"the adults are all insane\" and \"the girls are smarter than the boys\": Therefore, all the adults portrayed in the film tend to be caricatured, while the teenage girls are written as more assertive and powerful than the boys. For the treatment of the teenage actors, Mitchell also stated that the actors all had their own trailer and were generally kept separated, because \"we did not want them to date after the second week and break up after the fourth\", which would have made filming difficult.\n\nMitchell, a science fiction fan, admitted that this project \"was a dream\", because it brought him together with four of his favorite SF cult heroes: namely Wonder Woman (popularized in the eponymous 1970s television series by actress Lynda Carter), Snake Plissken (portrayed by Kurt Russell), Ash Williams (from \"Evil Dead\", played by Bruce Campbell) and Cloris Leachman, who earned fame as Frau Blücher in \"Young Frankenstein\"; and worked with Lynda Carter before in the pilot movie episode for the Wonder Woman TV Series playing Hippolyta opposite Lynda Carter who played Wonder Woman herself.\n\nOn an estimated budget of US$ 35 million, the film grossed just under $64 million in the US, and another $22 million internationally, bringing the total to $86 million.\n\n\"Sky High\" received generally favorable reviews from critics who praised the film's story, themes, writing, Mitchell's direction, and the performances of Angarano, Russell, Panabaker, Winstead and Strait. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 73% based on reviews from 131 critics, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The site's critical consensus states: \"This highly derivative superhero coming-of-age flick is moderately entertaining, family-friendly fluff.\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 62% based on reviews from 29 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade A- on a scale of A+ to F.\n\nThe film has developed a cult following among millennials who grew up with the movie.\n\nJoe Leydon of Variety magazine praised the film calling it: \"Smartly written and sprightly played, “Sky High” satisfies with a clever commingling of spoofy superheroics, school-daze hijinks\" and \"this lively live-action Disney release stands on its own merits as a tongue-in-cheek fantasy with cross-generational appeal.\"\nNeil Smith at BBC.com wrote: \"While originality is hardly the film's strongest suit, its agreeable mix of knowing spoof and kid-pleasing fantasy makes it considerably more engaging than some of the 'straight' superhero blockbusters we've suffered recently.\"\n\nThe \"Sky High\" Original Soundtrack was released by Hollywood Records on July 26, 2005, and is composed of covers of songs from the 1980s (with the exception of \"Just What I Needed\", which was from the late 1970s). While none of Michael Giacchino's score was included on the song album, a limited edition of his score was issued by Intrada Records in 2017.\n\n\nAllMusic rated the album 2.5/5, saying that it \"stumbles more than it succeeds\" and is \"painfully conventional.\"\n\nThe film was released in separate widescreen and format editions on DVD on November 29, 2005. It was the first Disney movie ever released on home video to never have a VHS release. It was also released on high definition Blu-ray for an original widescreen presentation on November 21, 2006.\n\nIn November 2016, it was announced that Disney is developing a sequel to \"Sky High,\" and that the film is in early development stages. In January 2019, Mike Mitchell revealed about earlier plans to make a franchise; but due to the film's box-office performance, nothing came to be. A sequel to the film would have been called \"Save U\" (as in Save University) and would have featured the characters graduating high school and attending college. There were also plans to make a TV series. Everyone, except for Kurt Russell and Kelly Preston, had signed on to return.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2296063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2296063", "title": "Harsens Island", "text": "Harsens Island\n\nHarsens Island is a wet marshy location at the mouth of the St. Clair River on Lake St. Clair, in the U.S. state of Michigan. Politically, the island is in Clay Township of St. Clair County\n\nThe island was named for its first Euro-American settler, Jacob Harsen (sometimes referred to as \"James\")\n, who was a descendant of people from various ethnicities who populated New Amsterdam, including Dutch, Huguenot French, and Walloon on his father’s side ; his mother was Dutch and French . He was a direct descendant of David Pieterse Schuyler of the New York Schuyler family and Wolfert Gerritse van Couwenhoven. Harsen migrated from Albany, New York in about 1779, during the American Revolutionary War, with his daughter and son-in-law Isaac Gerrit Graveraet (or Graveret). Harsen bought the island from the local Native Americans in 1783. It was also known as \"Jacob Island\" (also James or Jacobus Island) as late as 1809. The name of the post office, Sans Souci, was changed to \"Harsens Island\" in 1960.\n\nGreat Britain and the United States disputed the island's jurisdiction for many years. The 1783 Treaty of Paris, which ended the American Revolutionary War, described the international boundary line with imprecise terms in several places, including the mouth of the St. Clair River. The area had not been surveyed at that time. In the most commonly known map of the area from that period, made by John Mitchell in 1755 and which was used in negotiating the treaty, the delta and all the islands at the mouth of the St. Clair River are absent.\n\nAccording to the 1783 treaty, the boundary line was to run through the middle of Lake Erie until it arrives at the water communication between that lake and Lake Huron, \"thence along the middle of said water communication into the Lake Huron\". Due to this vagueness, all of the delta islands, including Harsens and Dickinson, were claimed by the British. Some persons located in the new United States who did not want to renounce their status as British subjects following the war moved to make their residences there. The area was administered by the Hesse District of Upper Canada, which also awarded land grants in the islands. In 1809, surveyors for the British government placed the boundary line in the north channel, which placed all of the delta and islands under British control.\n\nBut, the 1814 Treaty of Ghent, which ended the War of 1812, acknowledged the ambiguity of provisions in the 1783 treaty:\nAnd, whereas, doubts have arisen, what was the middle of the said river, lakes, and water communication, and whether certain islands lying in the same were within the dominions of his Britannic majesty, or of the United States.\" To decide these questions, two commissioners were to be appointed, one from each nation, to designate the international boundary. They executed their survey of the Detroit River, Lake St. Clair, and the St. Clair River in 1819 and 1820; and issued their final conclusions on June 18, 1822. Their decision regarding the St. Clair River delta was that the boundary should run north through Lake St. Clair, entering \"that mouth or channel of the River St. Clair which is usually denominated the Old Ship Channel; thence along the middle of said channel, between Squirrel Island on the southeast, and Herson's Island on the northwest, to the upper end of the last mentioned island, which is nearly opposite to Point aux Chenes, on the American shore; thence along the middle of the River St. Clair, keeping to the west of, and near, the islands called Belle Riviere Isle, and Isle aux Cerfs, to Lake Huron.\n\nBy this definition, both Harsens and Dickinson islands were placed on the U.S. side of the boundary.\n\nIn 1870 a case arose involving Hiram Little of Wallaceburg, Ontario, a captain who was given a contract to provide cord wood and supplies to a work crew. At the time, a ship canal was being dredged through the marshy areas near Lake St. Clair. By this time shipping was increasing and the need for a deep, free-flowing canal was required. During one trip to the work area, Capt. Little's ship was seized by U.S. officials who claimed he was operating illegally since he was in U.S. waters. Little protested, claiming he was in Canadian water, and challenged U.S. officials to prove their contention. After searching of documents, including contact with the Crown in England who supplied early charts of the area, Capt. Little was ultimately proven correct. To avoid further embarrassment, the U.S. officials moved the international boundary east, further infringing on Canadian (and First Nations) land.\n\nThe present St. Clair River, from Russel Island to Lake St. Clair, has been the international boundary line between Canada and the United States ever since. Some observers still disagree as to which nation should legally \"own\" Harsen's Island and the St. Clair delta area. The Walpole Island First Nation claims that Harsen's Island is unceded territory and properly belongs to them.\n\nHarsens Island is the only U.S. island in the Flats that can be reached by automobile ferry, and is the only one with roads and an unincorporated community, Sans Souci. The island community had a public school, which has closed and been replaced by a restaurant. Other tourist attractions include shops, an art gallery, and a small airport. All the other U.S. islands—there are scores of them—are accessible only by boat.\n\nThe St. Clair River is an integral part of the Great Lakes, draining water from Lake Huron down into Lake St. Clair. Lake St. Clair then empties into the Detroit River, which flows into Lake Erie. The delta was formed about 6,000 years ago and long was a desired area of habitation by indigenous peoples.\n\nThe St. Clair River is the international boundary between the United States and Canada.

Despite his conversion to Calvinism he was never trusted by the Scots and returned to France where he ended his days. Sir James Melville described him as \"of nature upright, just and gentle\". He was the first to popularise the firstname Esmé (spelled also Edme, etc, he signed his name as \"Amy\", meaning \"beloved\" (aimé)) in the British Isles.\n\nHe was the son and heir of John Stewart, 5th Seigneur d'Aubigny (d.1567) (a younger son of John Stewart, 3rd Earl of Lennox) by his wife Anne de la Queuille, a French noblewoman. His father had inherited (through adoption from his great uncle Sir Robert Stewart, 4th Seigneur d'Aubigny (c.1470–1544)), the French Seigneurie (lordship of the manor) of Aubigny and its estates, including the Château d'Aubigny at Aubigny-sur-Nère in the ancient province of Berry, central France, built by him, also the nearby secondary seat of Château de la Verrerie.\n\nHe spent much of his life in France and succeeded his father as 6th Seigneur d'Aubigny in 1567. At the age of 37 he came to Scotland, where he was introduced to his first cousin once removed, the 13-year-old James VI of Scotland, when the latter made his formal entry into Edinburgh and began his personal rule. Esmé was an exotic visitor who fascinated the young James, who began to shower him with rewards and preferments. He was appointed to the Privy Council of Scotland, was created Earl of Lennox on 5 March 1580 (which title having been inherited by King James from his paternal grandfather had merged into the crown), and then Duke of Lennox on 5 August 1581. He was also created Earl of Darnley, Lords Tarboulton and Dalkeith and received other favours.\n\nJames VI gave him jewels that remained from the collection of Mary, Queen of Scots, including in June 1581 a belt of knots of pearls and diamonds, and in October 1581 a gold cross with diamonds and rubies, the \"Great Harry\" or \"Great H of Scotland\", a chain of rubies and diamonds,with a diamond \"carcan\" necklace with roses of gold and a pair of matching hair garnishings, another suite of carcan and back and fore hair garnishings, and other pieces. The gift was witnessed by Elizabeth Stewart, Countess of Arran, and officials of the wardrobe.\n\nDuring his rise he was careful to maintain his popularity with the Burgh administrators of Scotland's towns. For example in July 1580 the English diplomat Robert Bowes reported that Lennox had obtained fishing rights in Aberdeen, which the deposed Regent Morton had given to his servant George Auchinleck of Balmanno, and had then arranged for the King to give this valuable source of income to the town.\n\nIn Presbyterian Scotland, the thought of a Catholic duke irked many, and Lennox had to make a choice between his Catholic faith and his loyalty to the king. Lennox chose the latter, who taught him the doctrines of Calvinism. Nevertheless the Church of Scotland remained suspicious of Lennox after his public conversion and took alarm when he had the Earl of Morton tried and beheaded on charges of treason.\n\nIn response the Scottish nobles plotted to oust Lennox. They did so by luring James to Ruthven Castle as a guest where they kept him as prisoner for ten months. The Lord Enterprisers then forced James to banish Lennox. A lengthy denunciation of Lennox was issued from Stirling Castle on 17 September 1582, citing his religion, association with the murderers of Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley (King James's father) and Regent Moray and Regent Lennox and his control over the royal household and international intrigue. Lennox stayed for a while at Dumbarton Castle. In December whilst travelling south from Berwick on Tweed, by chance near Northallerton he encountered the French ambassador, M. de la Mothe Fénelon, who was travelling northward to treat with the Gowrie Regime. In London the Scottish poet William Fowler pumped Lennox for information which he sent to Francis Walsingham.\n\nLennox returned to France where he started a secret correspondence with King James. He met a frosty reception in France as an apostate. Although the Scottish nobles believed that they would be proved right in their belief that Lennox's conversion was artificial following his return France, he remained a Presbyterian.\n\nHe died in Paris on 26 May 1583. His final letter to James Stewart, Lord Doune, requested him to take care of his son and to recover his former possessions in Scotland for his benefit. William Schaw took his heart back to King James in Scotland, followed by his wife and eldest son Ludovic Stewart. King James had repeatedly vouched for Lennox's religious sincerity and memorialized him in a poem called \"Ane Tragedie of the Phoenix\", which compared him to an exotic bird of unique beauty killed by envy. King James I regarded all Lennox's family with great affection, and instructed his son King Charles I to do well by them. Charles faithfully fulfilled this obligation, and as a result the Lennox family had considerable influence at the Scottish and English Courts over the next two generations.\n\nIn about 1572 he married Catherine de Balsac (d.post-1630), a daughter of Guillaume de Balsac, Sieur d'Entragues, by his wife Louise d'Humières. Catherine outlived her husband by many years and spent her later life at the family estate at Aubigny, where she was entrusted with the upbringing of her grandchildren. By Catherine he had five children:\n\n\n\n"}

The neutron and x-ray diffraction of powder samples results in a pattern characterised by reflections (peaks in intensity) at certain positions. The height, width and position of these reflections can be used to determine many aspects of the material's structure.\n\nThe Rietveld method uses a least squares approach to refine a theoretical line profile until it\nmatches the measured profile. The introduction of this technique was a significant step forward in the\ndiffraction analysis of powder samples as, unlike other techniques at that time, it was able to deal reliably with strongly overlapping reflections.\n\nThe method was first implemented in 1967, and reported in 1969 for the diffraction of monochromatic neutrons where the reflection-position is reported in terms of the Bragg angle, 2\"θ\". This terminology will be used here although the technique is\nequally applicable to alternative scales such as x-ray energy or neutron time-of-flight. The only wavelength and technique independent scale is in reciprocal space units or momentum transfer \"Q\", which is historically rarely used in powder diffraction but very common in all other diffraction and optics techniques. The relation is\n\nThe most common powder XRD refinement technique used today is based on the method proposed in the 1960s by Hugo Rietveld. The Rietveld method fits a calculated profile (including all structural and instrumental parameters) to experimental data. It employs the non-linear least squares method, and requires the reasonable initial approximation of many free parameters, including peak shape, unit cell dimensions and coordinates of all atoms in the crystal structure. Other parameters can be guessed while still being reasonably refined. In this way one can refine the crystal structure of a powder material from PXRD data. The successful outcome of the refinement is directly related to the quality of the data, the quality of the model (including initial approximations), and the experience of the user.\n\nThe Rietveld method is an incredibly powerful technique which began a remarkable era for powder XRD and materials science in general. Powder XRD is at heart a very basic experimental technique with diverse applications and experimental options. Despite being slightly limited by the one-dimensionality of PXRD data and limited resolution, powder XRD's power is astonishing. It is possible to determine the accuracy of a crystal structure model by fitting a profile to a 1D plot of observed intensity vs angle. It is important to remember that Rietveld refinement requires a crystal structure model and offers no way to come up with such a model on its own. However, it can be used to find structural details missing from a partial or complete ab initio structure solution, such as unit cell dimensions, phase quantities, crystallite sizes/shapes, atomic coordinates/bond lengths, micro strain in crystal lattice, texture, and vacancies.\n\nBefore exploring Rietveld refinement, it is necessary to establish a greater understanding of powder diffraction data and what information is encoded therein in order to establish a notion of how to create a model of a diffraction pattern, which is of course necessary in Rietveld refinement. A typical diffraction pattern can be described by the positions, shapes, and intensities of multiple Bragg reflections. Each of the three mentioned properties encodes some information relating to the crystal structure, the properties of the sample, and the properties of the instrumentation. Some of these contributions are shown in Table 1, below.\nThe structure of a powder pattern is essentially defined by instrumental parameters and two crystallographic parameters: unit cell dimensions, and atomic content and coordination. So, a powder pattern model can be constructed as follows:\n\n\nIt is easy to model a powder pattern given the crystal structure of a material. The opposite, determining the crystal structure from a powder pattern, is much more complicated. A brief explanation of the process follows, though it is not the focus of this article.\n\nTo determine structure from a powder diffraction pattern the following steps should be taken. First, Bragg peak positions and intensities should be found by fitting to a peak shape function including background. Next, peak positions should be indexed and used to determine unit cell parameters, symmetry, and content. Third, peak intensities determine space group symmetry and atomic coordination. Finally, the model is used to refine all crystallographic and peak shape function parameters. To do this successfully, there is a requirement for excellent data which means good resolution, low background, and a large angular range.\n\nFor general application of the Rietveld method, irrespective of the software used, the observed Bragg peaks in a powder diffraction pattern are best described by the so-called peak shape function (PSF). The PSF is a convolution of three functions: the instrumental broadening Ω(θ), wavelength dispersion Λ(θ), and the specimen function Ψ(θ), with the addition of a background function, b(θ). It is represented as follows:\n\nformula_2\n\nWhere ⊗ denotes a convolution, which is defined for two functions f, and g, as an integral:\n\nformula_3\n\nThe instrumental function depends on the location and geometry of the source, monochromator, and sample. Wavelength function accounts for the distribution of the wavelengths in the source, and varies with the nature of the source and monochromatizing technique. The specimen function depends on several things. First is dynamic scattering, and secondly the physical properties of the sample such as crystallite size, and microstrain.\n\nA short aside: unlike the other contributions, those from the specimen function can be interesting in materials characterization. As such, average crystallite size, τ, and microstrain, ε, effects on Bragg peak broadening, β (in radians), can be described as follows, where k is a constant:\n\nformula_4 and formula_5\n\nReturning to the peak shape function, the goal is to correctly model the Bragg peaks which exist in the observed powder diffraction data. In the most general form, the intensity, formula_6, of the formula_7 point (formula_8, where formula_9 is the number of measured points) is the sum of the contributions formula_10, from the m overlapped Bragg peaks ( formula_11), and the background, formula_12, and can be described as follows:\n\nformula_13\n\nwhere: formula_14 is the intensity of the formula_15 Bragg peak, and formula_16. Since formula_14 is a multiplier, it is possible to analyze the behaviour of different normalized peak functions formula_18 independently of peak intensity, under the condition that the integral over infinity of the PSF is unity. There are various functions that can be chosen to do this with varying degrees of complexity. The most basic functions used in this way to represent Bragg reflections are the Gauss, and Lorentzian functions. Most commonly though, is the pseudo-Voigt function, a weighted sum of the former two (the full Voigt profile is a convolution of the two, but is computationally more demanding). The pseudo-Voigt profile is the most common and is the basis for most other PSF's. The pseudo-Voigt function can be represented as:\n\nformula_19\n\nWhere\n\nformula_20\n\nand\n\nformula_21\n\nare the Gaussian and Lorentzian contributions, respectively.\n\nThus,\n\nformula_22.\n\nWhere:\n\n\nThe pseudo-Voigt function, like the Gaussian and Lorentz functions, is a centrosymmetric function, and as such does not model asymmetry. This can be problematic for non-ideal powder XRD data, such as those collected at synchrotron radiation sources, which generally exhibit asymmetry due to the use of multiple focusing optics.\n\nThe Finger Cox Jephcoat function is similar to the pseudo-Voigt, but has better handling of asymmetry 12, which is treated in terms of axial divergence. The function is a convolution of pseudo-Voigt with the intersection of the diffraction cone and a finite receiving slit length using two geometrical parameters, S/L, and H/L, where S, and D are the sample and the detector slit dimensions in the direction parallel to the goniometer axis, and L is the goniometer radius 12 .\n\nThe shape of a powder diffraction reflection is influenced by the characteristics of the beam, the experimental\narrangement, and the sample size and shape. In the case of monochromatic neutron sources the convolution\nof the various effects has been found to result in a reflex almost exactly Gaussian in shape. If this\ndistribution is assumed then the contribution of a given reflection to the profile y at position 2\"θ\"\nis:\n\nformula_41\n\nwhere \"H\" is the full width at half peak height (full-width half-maximum), 2\"θ\" is the centre\nof the reflex, and I is the calculated intensity of the reflex (determined from the structure factor,\nthe Lorentz factor, and multiplicity of the reflection)\n\nAt very low diffraction angles the reflections may acquire an asymmetry due to the vertical divergence of the beam.\nRietveld used a semi-empirical correction factor, A to account for this asymmetry\n\nformula_42\n\nwhere P is the asymmetry factor and s is +1,0,-1 depending on the difference 2θ-2θ\nbeing positive, zero or negative respectively.\n\nAt a given position more than one diffraction peak may contribute to the profile. The intensity is simply the sum of\nall reflections contributing at the point 2θ.\n\nFor a Bragg peak formula_43, the observed integrated intensity, formula_44, as determined from numerical integration is:\n\nformula_45,\n\nwhere formula_46 is the total number of data points in the range of the Bragg peak. The integrated intensity depends on multiple factors, and can be expressed as the following product:\n\nformula_47\n\nwhere:\n\n\nThe width of the diffraction peaks are found to broaden at higher Bragg angles. This angular dependency was originally represented by\n\nformula_56\n\nwhere U, V and W are the halfwidth parameters and may be refined during the fit.\n\nIn powder samples there is a tendency for plate- or rod-like crystallites to align themselves along the axis of a cylindrical sample holder. In solid polycrystalline samples the production of the material may result in greater volume fraction of certain crystal orientations (commonly referred to as texture). In such cases the reflex intensities will vary from that predicted for a completely random distribution. Rietveld allowed for moderate cases of the former by introducing a correction factor:\n\nformula_57\n\nwhere I is the intensity expected for a random sample, G is the preferred orientation parameter and α is the acute angle between the scattering vector and the normal of the crystallites.\n\nThe principle of the Rietveld Method is to minimise a function M which analyzes the difference between a\ncalculated profile y(calc) and the observed data y(obs). Rietveld defined such an equation as:\n\nformula_58\n\nwhere W is the statistical weight and c is an overall scale factor such that formula_59\n\nThe fitting method used in Rietveld refinement is the non-linear least squares approach. A detailed derivation of non-linear least squares fitting will not be given here. Further detail can be found in Chapter 6 of Pecharsky and Zavalij's text 12 . There are a few things to note however. First, non-linear least squares fitting has an iterative nature for which convergence may be difficult to achieve if the initial approximation is too far from correct, or when the minimized function is poorly defined. The latter occurs when correlated parameters are being refined at the same time, which may result in divergence and instability of the minimization. This iterative nature also means that convergence to a solution does not occur immediately for the method is not exact. Each iteration depends on the results of the last which dictate the new set of parameters used for refinement. Thus, multiple refinement iterations are required to eventually converge to a possible solution.\n\nUsing non-linear least squares minimization, the following system is solved:\n\nformula_60\n\nwhere formula_61is the calculated intensity and formula_62is the observed intensity of a point formula_63in the powder pattern, formula_64, is a scale factor, and formula_9is the number of measured data points. The minimized function is given by:\n\nformula_66\n\nwhere formula_67is the weight, and formula_64from the previous equation is unity (since formula_64 is usually absorbed in the phase scale factor). The summation extends to all n data points. Considering the peak shape functions and accounting for the overlapping of Bragg peaks because of the one-dimensionality of XRD data, the expanded form of the above equation for the case of a single phase measured with a single wavelength becomes:\n\nformula_70\n\nWhere,\n\n\nFor a material that contains several phases (p), the contribution from each is accounted for by modifying the above equation as follows:\n\nformula_79\n\nIt can easily be seen from the above equations that experimentally minimizing the background, which holds no useful structural information, is paramount for a successful profile fitting. For a low background, the functions are defined by contributions from the integrated intensities and peak shape parameters. But with a high background, the function being minimized depends on the adequacy of the background and not integrated intensities or peak shapes. Thus, a structure refinement cannot adequately yield structural information in the presence of a large background.\n\nIt is also worth noting the increased complexity brought forth by the presence of multiple phases. Each additional phase adds to the fitting, more Bragg peaks, and another scale factor tied to corresponding structural parameters, and peak shape. Mathematically they are easily accounted for, but practically, due to the finite accuracy and limited resolution of experimental data, each new phase can lower the quality and stability of the refinement. It is advantageous to use single phase materials when interested in finding precise structural parameters of a material. However, since the scale factors of each phase are determined independently, Rietveld refinement of multi phase materials can quantitatively examine the mixing ratio of each phase in the material.\n\nGenerally, background is calculated as a Chebyshev Polynomial. In GSAS and GSAS-II they appear as follows. Again, background is treated as a Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind (\"Handbook of Mathematical Functions\", M. Abramowitz and IA. Stegun, Ch. 22). Where the intensity of the background is:\n\nformula_80\n\nwhere formula_81are the coefficients of the Chebyshev polynomial taken from Table 22.3, pg. 795 of the Handbook. The coefficients have the form:\n\nformula_82\n\nand the values for formula_83are found in the Handbook. The angular range (formula_84) is converted to formula_85to make the Chebyshev polynomial orthogonal by\n\nformula_86\n\nAnd, the orthogonal range for this function is -1 to +1.\n\nNow – given the considerations of background, peak shape functions, integrated intensity, and non-linear least squares minimization – the parameters used in the Rietveld refinement which put these things together can be introduced. Below are the groups of independent least squares parameters generally refined in a Rietveld refinement.\n\n\nEach Rietveld refinement is unique and there is no prescribed sequence of parameters to include in a refinement. It is up to the user to determine and find the best sequence of parameters for refinement. It is worth noting that it is rarely possible to refine all relevant variables simultaneously from the beginning of a refinement, nor near the end since the least squares fitting will be destabilized or lead to a false minimum. It is important for the user to determine a stopping point for a given refinement. Given the complexity of Rietveld refinement it is important to have a clear grasp of the system being studied (sample, and instrumentation) to ensure that results are accurate, realistic, and meaningful. High data quality, a large enough formula_37 range, and a good model – to serve as the initial approximation in the least squares fitting – are necessary for a successful, reliable, and meaningful Rietveld refinement.\n\nSince refinement depends on finding the best fit between a calculated and experimental pattern, it is important to have a numerical figure of merit quantifying the quality of the fit. Below are the figures of merit generally used to characterize the quality of a refinement. They provide insight to how well the model fits the observed data.\n\nProfile Residual (reliability factor):\n\nformula_88\n\nWeighted profile residual:\n\nformula_89\n\nBragg residual:\n\nformula_90\n\nExpected profile residual:\n\nformula_91\n\nGoodness of fit:\n\nformula_92\n\nIt is worth mentioning that all but one (R B ) figure of merit include a contribution from the background. There are some concerns about the reliability of these figures, as well there is no threshold or accepted value which dictates what represents a good fit. The most popular and conventional figure of merit used is the goodness of fit which should approach unity given a perfect fit, though this is rarely the case. In practice, the best way to assess quality is a visual analysis of the fit by plotting the difference between the observed and calculated data plotted on the same scale.\n\n"}

{"id": "2296089", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2296089", "title": "Bill Bergson", "text": "Bill Bergson\n\nBill Bergson () is a fictional character created by Swedish writer Astrid Lindgren. The first book featuring him was published in 1946.\n\nLindgren's detective story is about Bill Bergson, a more-or-less ordinary Swedish boy with an extraordinary fascination with detective work. He lives in the small town \"Lillköping\". He identifies clues, investigates enigmas, and solves the riddle surrounding a mysterious stranger while the police and other adults overlook or dismiss the whole matter. He and his friends several times solve real crimes including murder and kidnapping. Lindgren wrote shorthand for Harry Söderman, a doctor in Criminology, and it was during this work that she learned the basics of criminology that she later used in her stories.\n\nBill and his friends also play a game they call the Wars of the Roses. He, along with his two friends Anders and Eva-Lotta, are the White Rose, while three other kids, Sixten, Jonte and Benka, are the Red Rose. They \"fight\" over the possession of \"Stormumriken\", an oddly-shaped stone. The group that doesn't have the stone must use all their wits and energy to obtain it. The group that has the stone must give the other group clues on where to find it.\n\nAlthough there is a \"war\" between the two roses all six of the youngsters are good friends and there is simply a playful rivalry between them. The Red Roses help the Whites when they are threatened by real dangers.\n\nLindgren wrote three books about Bill Bergson: \nand two theater plays:\n\nViking edition\n\nOxford edition\n\n\nThe character Mikael Blomkvist in Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy is dubbed \"Kalle Blomkvist\" by the press to mock him in his investigative reporting. Lisbeth Salander's name appears to be taken from Eva-Lotta Lisander, and is modeled in most other respect on Lindgren's other famous character, Pippi Longstocking.\n\nIn \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\", three of Lindgren's books are mentioned: \"The Children of Noisy Village\", \"Bill Bergson and the White Rose Rescue\" (although in the book the translation was \"Kalle Blomkvist and Rasmus\" from the original \"Kalle Blomkvist och Rasmus\"), and \"Pippi Longstocking\".\n\nThe relation between Astrid Lindgren and, at least, the first part of the Trilogy, can be taken farther when the fact that, in it, a cat is named 'Tjorven', is considered. The name comes from the Swedish television series \"Vi på Saltkråkan\" based on a script by Astrid Lindgren and not originally a book. Apart from this, the TV show dates from the early sixties, around the time when, in Stieg Larsson's novel, one of the crucial events which shapes the story takes place.\n\n"}
{"id": "2296094", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2296094", "title": "Field artillery in the American Civil War", "text": "Field artillery in the American Civil War\n\nField artillery in the American Civil War refers to the artillery weapons, equipment, and practices used by the Artillery branch to support the infantry and cavalry forces in the field. It does not include siege artillery, use of artillery in fixed fortifications, or coastal or naval artillery. Nor does it include smaller, specialized artillery classified as small arms.\n\nThe principal guns widely used in the field are listed in the following table.\n\nThere were two general types of artillery weapons used during the Civil War: smoothbores and rifles. Smoothbores included howitzers and guns.\n\nSmoothbore artillery refers to weapons that are not rifled. At the time of the Civil War, metallurgy and other supporting technologies had just recently evolved to a point allowing the large scale production of rifled field artillery. As such, many smoothbore weapons were still in use and production even at the end of the war. Smoothbore field artillery of the day fit into two role-based categories: guns and howitzers. Further classifications of the weapons were made based on the type of metal used, typically bronze or iron (cast or wrought), although some examples of steel were produced. Additionally, the artillery was often identified by the year of design in the Ordnance department references.\n\nThe smoothbore artillery was also categorized by the bore dimensions, based on the rough weight of the solid shot projectile fired from the weapon. For instance a 12-pounder field gun fired a 12-pound solid shot projectile from its diameter bore. It was practice, dating back to the 18th century, to mix gun and howitzers into batteries. Pre-war allocations called for 6-pounder field guns matched with 12-pounder howitzers, 9 and 12-pounder field guns matched with 24-pounder howitzers. But the rapid expansions of both combatant armies, mass introduction of rifled artillery, and the versatility of the 12-pounder \"Napoleon\" class of weapons all contributed to a change in the mixed battery practices.\n\nSmooth bore guns were designed to fire solid shot projectiles at high velocity, over low trajectories at targets in the open, although shell and canister were acceptable for use. The barrels of the guns were longer than corresponding howitzers, and called for higher powder charges to achieve the desired performance. Field guns were produced in 6-pounder (3.67 inch bore), 9-pounder (4.2 inch bore), and 12-pounder (4.62 inch bore) versions. Although some older iron weapons were pressed into service, and the Confederacy produced some new iron field guns, most of those used on the battlefields were of bronze construction.\n\nThe 6-pounder field gun was well represented by bronze Models of 1835, 1838, 1839, and 1841 early in the war. Even a few older iron Model 1819 weapons were pressed into service. Several hundred were used by the armies of both sides in 1861. But in practice the limited payload of the projectile was seen as a shortcoming of this weapon. Six pounder guns had mostly disappeared from the Union armies by 1863 but the Confederates continued using them until the end of the war.\n\nThe larger 9- and 12-pounders were less well represented. While the 9-pounder was still listed on Ordnance and Artillery manuals in 1861, very few were ever produced after the War of 1812. Nine-pounders were universally gone well before the Mexican War, and only scant references exist to any Civil War use of the weapons. The 12-pounder field gun appeared in a series of models mirroring the 6-pounder, but in far less numbers. At least one Federal battery, the 13th Indiana, took the 12-pounder field gun into service early in the war. The major shortcoming of these heavy field guns was mobility, as they required eight-horse teams as opposed to the six-horse teams of the lighter guns. A small quantity of 12-pounder field guns were rifled early in the war, but these were more experimental weapons, and no field service is recorded.\n\nBy far the most popular of the smoothbore cannon was the 12-pounder Model of 1857, Light, commonly called \"Napoleon\". The Model 1857 was of lighter weight than the previous 12-pounder guns, and could be pulled by a six-horse draft, yet offered the heavier projectile payload of the larger bore. It is sometimes called, confusingly, a \"gun-howitzer\" (because it possessed characteristics of both gun and howitzer) and is discussed in more detail separately below.\n\nHowitzers were short-barreled guns that were optimized for firing explosive shells in a high trajectory, but also for spherical case shot and canister, over a shorter range than the guns. While field use alluded to firing at targets consisting of enemy forces arrayed in the open, howitzers were considered the weapon of choice if the opposing forces were concealed behind terrain features or fortifications. It cost about $500. Howitzers used lighter gunpowder charges than guns of corresponding caliber. Field howitzer calibers used in the Civil War were 12-pounder (4.62 inch bore), 24-pounder (5.82 inch bore), and 32-pounder (6.41 inch bore). Most of the howitzers used in the war were bronze, with notable exceptions of some of Confederate manufacture.\n\nCoupled to the 6-pounder field gun in allocations of the pre-war Army, the M1841 12-pounder howitzer was represented by Models of 1835, 1838 and 1841. With a light weight and respectable projectile payload, the 12-pounder was only cycled out of the main field army inventories as production and availability of the 12-pounder \"Napoleon\" rose, and would see action in the Confederate armies up to the very end. \n\nAs with the corresponding heavy field guns, the heavier howitzers were available in limited quantities early in the war. Both Federal and Confederate contracts list examples of 24-pounders delivered during the war, and surviving examples exist of imported Austrian types of this caliber used by the Confederates. These 24-pounder howitzers found use in the \"reserve\" batteries of the respective armies, but were gradually replaced over time with heavy rifled guns. The only known 24-pounders in use by the Army of Northern Virginia were in Woolfolk's Batteries (later Battalion) with two batteries of 4 pieces each. With the exception of the Far Western theatre of the war (e.g. Halls Battery at Valverde New Mexico), Federals did not use 24-pounder howitzers in field. The 24- and 32-pounders were more widely used in fixed fortifications, but at least one of the later large weapons was with the 1st Connecticut Artillery as late as 1864.\n\nFinally, the lesser-known but highly mobile 12-pounder mountain Howitzer saw service with infantry and cavalry forces in the rugged western theaters and prairies, and continued in service during the Indian Wars. This versatile piece could utilize one of two carriages: a small carriage that could be drawn by a single animal or could be rapidly broken down to carry on the backs of pack animals, or a slightly larger prairie carriage to be drawn by two animals. A veteran of the Mexican–American War, several hundred more of these diminutive tubes were produced by Union foundries during the Civil War, and the Confederate Tredegar foundry turned out as many as 21 more. A Federal battery of four proved \"highly effective\" at the decisive battle of Glorieta, New Mexico, and Nathan Bedford Forrest frequently employed mountain howitzers for the rapid close-in combat that he favored.\n\nThe twelve-pound cannon \"Napoleon\" was the most popular smoothbore cannon used during the war. It was named after Napoleon III of France and was widely admired because of its safety, reliability, and killing power, especially at close range. In Union Ordnance manuals it was referred to as the \"light 12-pounder gun\" to distinguish it from the heavier and longer 12 pounder gun (which was virtually unused in field service.) It did not reach America until 1857. It was the last cast bronze gun used by an American army. The Federal version of the Napoleon can be recognized by the flared front end of the barrel, called the muzzle-swell. It was, however, relatively heavy compared to other artillery pieces and difficult to move across rough terrain.\n\nConfederate Napoleons were produced in at least six variations, most of which had straight muzzles, but at least eight catalogued survivors of 133 identified have muzzle swells. Additionally, four iron Confederate Napoleons produced by Tredegar Iron Works in Richmond have been identified, of an estimated 125 cast. In early 1863 Robert E. Lee sent nearly all of the Army of Northern Virginia's bronze 6-pounder guns to Tredegar to be melted down and recast as Napoleons. Copper for casting bronze pieces became increasingly scarce to the Confederacy throughout the war and became acute in November 1863 when the Ducktown copper mines near Chattanooga were lost to Union forces. Casting of bronze Napoleons by the Confederacy ceased and in January 1864 Tredegar began producing iron Napoleons.\n\nA Confederate cannoneer remembered, \"Our guns were 12 pound brass Napoleons, smooth bore, but accounted the best gun for all round field service then made. They fired solid shot, shell, grape and canister, and were accurate at a mile. We would not have exchanged them for Parrott Rifles, or any other style of guns. They were beautiful, perfectly plain, tapering gracefully from muzzle to \"reinforce\" or \"butt,\" without rings, or ornaments of any kind. We are proud of them and felt towards them almost as if they were human...\"\n\nThe rifle was the most widely used rifled gun during the war. Invented by John Griffen, it was extremely durable, with the barrel made of wrought iron, primarily produced by the Phoenix Iron Company of Phoenixville, Pennsylvania. There are few cases on record of the tube fracturing or bursting, a problem that plagued other rifles made of brittle cast iron. The rifle had exceptional accuracy. During the Battle of Atlanta, a Confederate gunner was quoted: \"The Yankee three-inch rifle was a dead shot at any distance under a mile. They could hit the end of a flour barrel more often than miss, unless the gunner got rattled.\" The 1st Minnesota Light Artillery Battery converted to the 3-inch Rifle on 5 March 1864; they were described as \"3-inch Rodman's guns\" in an 11 Nov. 1864 letter from 1st Lieutenant Henry S. Hurter to the Minnesota Adjutant General. \n\nThe 1st Minnesota Light Artillery took part in the Atlanta Campaign. It was retained in service after the war, with many converted to breechloading weapons as 3.2-inch converted rifles or 3-inch saluting guns. It was eventually replaced by the 3.2-inch gun M1885.The Confederates were unable to manufacture the wrought iron barrels for the 3\" rifle, thus captured ones were prized items. Despite the effectiveness of this weapon, the Confederacy did produce various bronze 3\" rifles and cast iron pieces with a straight tube; however, none of them were reliable and the latter were often prone to bursting at the breech.\n\nThe Parrott rifle, invented by Robert Parker Parrott, was manufactured in different sizes, from the 10-pounder Parrott rifle up to the rare 300-pounder. The 10- and 20-pounder Parrott rifles were used by both armies in the field. The smaller size was much more prevalent; it was made in two bore sizes, and . Confederate forces used both bore sizes during the war, which added to the complication of supplying the appropriate ammunition to its batteries. Until 1864, Union batteries used only the 2.9 inch Parrott, but they also employed 3\" Ordnance rifles. During the first day of the battle of Gettysburg, three Parrott rifles were temporarily unusable when 3\" ammunition was mistakenly issued to the battery. Following this, plans were made to re-bore all of the 2.9\" Parrotts to 3\" to standardize ammunition, and no further 2.9\" Parrotts were to be produced. The M1863, with a bore, had firing characteristics similar to the earlier model; it can be recognized by its straight barrel, without muzzle-swell.\n\nParrott rifles saw use in all the major battles of the war; the Union army carried a number of 10-pounders at First Bull Run and one 30-pounder. The 20-pounder Parrott only began production in the summer of 1861 and none were delivered until late in the year.\n\nParrotts were manufactured with a combination of cast iron and wrought iron. Cast iron improved the accuracy of the gun, but was brittle enough to suffer fractures. On the Parrott, a large reinforcing band made of tougher wrought iron was overlaid on the breech. The Parrott, while accurate, had a poor reputation for safety, and it was shunned by many artillerymen. The 20-pounder was the largest field gun used during the war, with the barrel alone weighing over 1,800 pounds (800 kg). After the Battle of Fredericksburg, the Army of the Potomac's chief of artillery Henry J. Hunt attempted to have the 20 pounder Parrott removed from the army's inventory, arguing that its enormous weight required a team of eight horses instead of the six needed for lighter guns, and the long range shells were of questionable reliability.\n\nEven before the start of the Civil War, an ordnance board recommended that rifling be added to the 6-pounder field gun in order to improve its accuracy. In December 1860, U.S. Secretary of War John B. Floyd wrote, \"the results of trials of rifled cannon and projectiles … indicates a superiority of James expanding projectiles for such cannon. The regulation 6-pounder, with a rifled bore (weight 884 pounds), carries a James projectile of about 13 pounds.\" James rifles were an early solution to the need for rifled artillery at the start of the war. Six-pounder bronze guns could be rifled to fire the projectiles invented by Charles Tillinghast James. Some were simply rifled from their initial 3.67\" bore, others were reamed to 3.80\" then rifled. Reaming to 3.80\" was preferred to eliminate wear deformities from service. Contemporaries often failed to differentiate between the two bore sizes. However, the effective descriptions for the 3.67\" gun are rifled 6-pounder or 12-pounder James rifle, while the 3.80\" variant was known as the 14-pounder James rifle. To add to the confusion, the variants of the 3.80\" bore rifle included two profiles (6-pounder and Ordnance), two metals (bronze and iron), three types of rifling (15, 10, and 7 grooves), and different weights. \n\nAlthough the James rifles were reported to be extremely accurate, the bronze rifling wore out rapidly, and the James rifles and projectiles soon fell out of favor. No James rifles are known to have been produced after 1862. The total numbers of James rifles are uncertain, but the 1862 Ohio Quartermaster General annual report recorded 82 rifled bronze pieces (44 of those specified as \"3.80 bore [James rifles]\") out of a total of 162 of all field artillery types. Unusual or out-of-favor types migrated to the Western theaters.\n\nThe Whitworth, designed by Joseph Whitworth and manufactured in England, was a rare gun during the war, but was an interesting precursor to modern artillery in that it was loaded from the breech and had exceptional accuracy over great distance. An engineering magazine wrote in 1864 that, \"At 1600 yards [1500 m] the Whitworth gun fired 10 shots with a lateral deviation of only 5 inches.\" This degree of accuracy made it effective in counter-battery fire, used almost as the equivalent of a sharpshooter's rifle, and also for firing over bodies of water. It was not popular as an anti-infantry weapon. It had a caliber of . The bore was hexagonal in cross-section, and the projectile was a long bolt that twisted to conform to the rifling. It is said that the bolts made a very distinctive eerie sound when fired, which could be distinguished from other projectiles.\n\nThe table below lists the guns used by both armies at the Battle of Antietam in September 1862. Though both sides employed the 6-pounder field gun and 12-pounder howitzer in the early battles, they were recognized as inferior to the 12-pounder Napoleon and soon discontinued in the Union armies in the Eastern Theater. However, Union and Confederate armies in the Western Theater continued to use both weapons. Some 6-pounder field guns were converted to 12- or 14-pounder James rifles. The 32-pounder howitzer was too heavy to be employed as field artillery and the one battery using them was soon rearmed with 3-inch Ordnance rifles. The 12-pounder Blakely rifle had a particularly violent recoil and fell out of favor.\n\nAmmunition came in wide varieties, designed to attack specific targets. A typical Union artillery battery (armed with six 12-pounder Napoleons) carried the following ammunition going into battle: 288 shot, 96 shells, 288 spherical cases, and 96 canisters.\n\nShot was a solid projectile that included no explosive charge. For a smoothbore, the projectile was a round \"cannonball\". For a rifled gun, the projectile was referred to as a bolt and had a cylindrical or spherical shape. In both cases, the projectile was used to impart kinetic energy for a battering effect, particularly effective for destroying enemy guns, limbers and caissons, and wagons. It was also effective for mowing down columns of infantry and cavalry and had psychological effects against its targets. Despite its effectiveness, many artillerymen were reluctant to use solid shot, preferring the explosive types of ordnance. With solid projectiles, accuracy was the paramount consideration, and they also caused more tube wear than their explosive counterparts.\n\nWhile rifled cannon had much greater accuracy on average than smoothbores, the smoothbores had an advantage firing round shot relative to the bolts fired from rifled pieces. Round shot could be employed in ricochet fire, extending the depth and range of its effect on land or water while bolts tended to dig in rather than ricochet.\n\nShells contained an explosive charge and were designed to burst into fragments in the midst of enemy troops. For smoothbores, the projectile was referred to as \"spherical shell\". Shells were more effective against troops behind obstacles or earthworks, and they were good for destroying wooden buildings by setting them on fire. They were ineffective against good quality masonry. A primary weakness of shell was that it typically produced only a few large fragments, the count increasing with caliber of the shell. A Confederate mid-war innovation perhaps influenced by British ordnance/munition imports was the \"polygonal cavity\" or \"segmented\" shell which used a polyhedral cavity core to create lines of weakness in the shell wall that would yield more regular fragmentation patterns—typically 12 similarly sized fragments. While segmented designs were most common in spherical shell, it was applied to specific rifled projectiles as well.\n\nSpherical shell used time fuses, while rifled shell could use timed fuse or be detonated on impact by percussion fuse. Fuse reliability was a concern; any shell that buried itself into the earth before detonating had little anti-personnel effectiveness. However, large caliber shells, such as the 32-pounder spherical, were effective at breaching entrenchments.\n\nCase (or \"spherical case\" for smoothbores) were antipersonnel projectiles carrying a smaller burst charge than shell, but designed to be more effective against exposed troops. While shell produced only a few large fragments, case was loaded with lead or iron balls and was designed to burst above and before the enemy line, showering down many more small but destructive projectiles on the enemy. The effect was analogous to a weaker version of canister. With case the lethality of the balls and fragments came from the velocity of the projectile itself – the small burst charge only fragmented the case and dispersed the shrapnel. The spherical case used in a 12-pounder Napoleon contained 78 balls. The name shrapnel derives from its inventor, Henry Shrapnel.\n\nThe primary limitations to case effectiveness came in judging the range, setting the fuse accordingly, and the reliability and variability of the fuse itself.\n\nCanister shot was the deadliest type of ammunition, consisting of a thin metal container containing layers of lead or iron balls packed in sawdust. Upon exiting the muzzle, the container disintegrated, and the balls fanned out as the equivalent of a very large shotgun blast. The effective range of the canister was only , but within that range dozens of enemy infantrymen could be mowed down. Even more devastating was \"double canister\", generally used only in dire circumstances at extremely close range, where two containers of balls were fired simultaneously using the regular single powder charge.\n\nGrapeshot, which originated as a naval round for cutting enemy rigging or clearing packed decks of personnel, was the predecessor of, and a variation on, canister, in which a smaller number of larger metal balls were arranged on stacked iron plates with a threaded bolt running down the center to hold them as a unit inside the barrel. It was used at a time when some cannons burst when loaded with too much gunpowder, but as cannons got stronger, grapeshot was replaced by canister. A grapeshot round (or \"stand\") used in a 12-pounder Napoleon contained 9 balls, contrasted against the 27 smaller balls in a canister round. By the time of the Civil War, grapeshot was obsolete and largely replaced by canister. The period Ordnance and Gunnery work states that grape was excluded from \"field and mountain services.\" Few, if any, rounds were issued to field artillery batteries.\n\nThe most pervasive piece of artillery equipment was the horse.\n\nHorses were required to pull the enormous weight of the cannon and ammunition; on average, each horse pulled about 700 pounds (317.5 kg). Each gun in a battery used two six-horse teams (for normal field artillery; heavier guns required much larger teams): one team pulled a limber that attached to the trail of the gun to form a four-wheeled wagon of sorts; the other pulled a limber that attached to a caisson. The large number of horses posed a logistical challenge for the artillery, because they had to be fed, maintained, and replaced when worn out or injured. Artillery horses were generally selected second from the pool of high quality animals; cavalry mounts were the best horses. The life expectancy of an artillery horse was under eight months. They suffered from disease, exhaustion from long marches—typically 16 miles (25.8 km) in 10 hours—and battle injuries.\n\nHorses panicked easier than men when subjected to counter-battery fire, and their movements were made difficult because they were harnessed together into teams. Robert Stiles wrote about Union counter-battery fire striking a Confederate battery on Benner's Hill at the Battle of Gettysburg:\n\nThe term \"horse artillery\" refers to the faster moving artillery batteries that typically supported cavalry regiments. The term \"flying artillery\" is sometimes used as well. In such batteries, the artillerymen were all mounted, in contrast to batteries in which the artillerymen walked alongside their guns (although regular artillerymen would sometimes jump onto the backs of their team when rapid battlefield movement was required, and they typically rode upon the limbers, caissons or supply wagons while on a march). A prominent organization of such artillery in the Union Army was the U.S. Horse Artillery Brigade.\n\nThe limber was a two-wheeled carriage that carried an ammunition chest. It was connected directly behind the team of six horses and towed either a gun or a caisson. In either case, the combination provided the equivalent of a four-wheeled vehicle, which distributed the load over two axles but was easier to maneuver on rough terrain than a four-wheeled wagon. The combination of a Napoleon gun and a packed limber weighed 3,865 pounds (1,753.1 kg).\n\nThe caisson was also a two-wheeled carriage. It carried two ammunition chests and a spare wheel. A fully loaded limber and caisson combination weighed 3,811 pounds (1728.6 kg).\n\nThe limbers, caissons, and gun carriages were all constructed of oak. Each ammunition chest typically carried about 500 pounds (226.8 kg) of ammunition or supplies. In addition to these vehicles, there were also battery supply wagons and portable forges that were used to service the guns.\n\nThe Union Army entered the war with a strong advantage in artillery. It had ample manufacturing capacity in Northern factories, and it had a well-trained and professional officer corps manning that branch of the service. Brig. Gen. Henry J. Hunt, who was the chief of artillery for the Army of the Potomac for part of the war, was well recognized as a most efficient organizer of artillery forces, and he had few peers in the practice of the sciences of gunnery and logistics. Another example was John Gibbon, the author of the influential \"Artillerist's Manual\" published in 1863 (although Gibbon would achieve considerably more fame as an infantry general during the war). Shortly after the outbreak of war, Brig. Gen. James Wolfe Ripley, Chief of Ordnance, ordered the conversion of old smoothbores into rifled cannon and the manufacture of Parrott guns.\n\nThe basic unit of Union artillery was the battery, which usually consisted of six guns. Attempts were made to ensure that all six guns in a battery were of the same caliber, simplifying training and logistics. Each gun, or \"piece\", was operated by a gun crew of eight, plus four additional men to handle the horses and equipment. Two guns operating under the control of a lieutenant were known as a \"section\". The battery of six guns was commanded by a captain. Artillery brigades composed of five batteries were commanded by colonels and supported the infantry organizations as follows: each infantry corps was supported directly by one artillery brigade and, in the case of the Army of the Potomac, five brigades formed the Artillery Reserve. In addition, George McClellan had assigned one regular army battery to every four volunteer batteries to provide an example of regular army professionalism to them. This arrangement, championed by Hunt, allowed artillery to be massed in support of the entire army's objective, rather than being dispersed all across the battlefield. An example of the tension between infantry commanders and artillery commanders was during the massive Confederate bombardment of Cemetery Ridge on 3 July 1863, the third day of the Battle of Gettysburg. Hunt had difficulty persuading the infantry commanders, such as Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock, against using all of their artillery ammunition in response to the Confederate bombardment, understanding the value to the defenders of saving the ammunition for the infantry assault to come, Pickett's Charge.\n\nAt the start of the war, the U.S. Army had 2,283 guns on hand, but only about 10% of these were field artillery pieces. By the end of the war, the army had 3,325 guns, of which 53% were field pieces. The army reported as \"supplied to the army during the war\" the following quantities: 7,892 guns, 6,335,295 artillery projectiles, 2,862,177 rounds of fixed artillery ammunition, 45,258 tons of lead metal, and 13,320 tons of gunpowder.\n\nThe South was at a relative disadvantage to the North for deployment of artillery. The industrial North had far greater capacity for manufacturing weapons, and the Union blockade of Southern ports prevented many foreign arms from reaching the Southern armies. The Confederacy had to rely to a significant extent on captured Union artillery pieces (either on the battlefield or by capturing armories, such as Harpers Ferry); it is estimated that two-thirds of all Confederate field artillery was captured from the Union. The Confederate cannons built in the South often suffered from the shortage of quality metals and shoddy workmanship. Another disadvantage was the quality of ammunition as the fuses needed for detonating shells and cases were frequently inaccurate, causing premature or delayed explosions. All that, coupled with the Union gunners' initial competence and experience gained as the war progressed, led Southern forces to dread assaults on Northern positions backed up by artillery. A Southern officer observed, \"The combination of Yankee artillery with Rebel infantry would make an army that could be beaten by no one.\" Union artillery was used on the Army of Northern Virginia to devastating effect on a number of occasions, particularly during the Seven Days Battles (particularly the Battle of Malvern Hill) and Gettysburg.\n\nBecause of his artillery weakness, Robert E. Lee tended to favor fighting in locations such as the Wilderness that limited the effectiveness of long-range Union artillery and led to close-quarters combat, where the Army of Northern Virginia's large number of smoothbore guns were more effective.\n\nConfederate batteries usually consisted of four guns, in contrast to the Union's six. This was a matter of necessity, because guns were always in short supply. And, unlike the Union, batteries frequently consisted of mixed caliber weapons. During the first half of the war Confederate batteries were generally attached to infantry brigades. A reorganization of the Confederate artillery resulted in batteries being organized into battalions (versus the Union brigades) of three batteries each in the Western Theater of the war and generally four batteries each in the Eastern Theater of the war. These artillery battalions were assigned to the direct support of infantry divisions. Each infantry corps was assigned two battalions as an Artillery Reserve, but there was no such Reserve at the army level. The chief of artillery for Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, Brig. Gen. William N. Pendleton, had considerable difficulty massing artillery for best effect because of this organization.\n\nAfter reorganizing the Army of Northern Virginia into two corps led by James Longstreet and \"Stonewall\" Jackson following the Seven Days Battles, Lee assigned each corps two reserve artillery battalions in addition to the individual batteries assigned to each infantry brigade. The officers in charge of the reserve battalions were all drawn from Longstreet's command, which displeased Jackson as he had not been allowed to select his own men for the corps artillery reserve, however he accepted it without complaining.\n\nAlthough virtually all battles of the Civil War included artillery, some battles are known better than others for significant artillery engagements, arguably critical to the overall outcome:\n\n\nNot nearly as well known as their infantry and cavalry counterparts, a small group of officers excelled at artillery deployment, organization, and the science of gunnery:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It won the Newbery Medal for excellence as the most distinguished contribution to American children's literature in 1942.\n\nThe book is set in the year 1756 during the French and Indian War in Guilderland, New York. Ten-year-old Edward Van Alstyne (throughout the book, he is called \"Ateoord\", which is his name in Dutch) and his mother Gertrude are determined to protect their home and family with an ancient (and much too heavy) Spanish matchlock gun that Edward's great-grandfather had brought from Bergen Op Zoom in the Netherlands while his father Teunis is away from home with the local militia fighting the enemy (using, to Edward's disappointment, a musket instead of the matchlock).\n\nGertrude, Edward, and his younger sister Trudy go about their everyday chores, but news arrives that the French-Indian forces have been attacking and burning nearby settlements and that Teunis and his militia company have been sent to intercept them. Later that day, while she and the children are out herding the cows, Gertrude spots a column of smoke in the distance and realizes that raiders are getting closer. Rather than take herself and the children over to her mother-in-law's brick house as Teunis had previously suggested, since raiders would be more likely to attack it rather than their house, she devises a plan for a possible Indian attack. Returning home, she loads the matchlock gun, fixes it in position to fire and instructs Edward how and when to fire it. She then goes outside to keep a watch for any approaching raiders.\n\nAt the book's climax, Gertrude sees flames in the distance and realizes that her mother-in-law's house has indeed been attacked. Moments later, she spots five Indians approaching in the darkness, bent on burning the house. Barely able to outrun them, she reaches the front porch and manages to shout a pre-arranged warning to Edward, but is wounded in the shoulder by a thrown tomahawk, and the boy fires the gun through the front window, killing three raiders and driving off the remaining two (one of them, apparently wounded, is later killed by the returning militia). As their house burns, Edward and Trudy manage to drag their unconscious mother to safety. Edward goes back into the burning house to save the Spanish gun, and later he, Trudy and their mother are found by their father and the other militiamen.\n\nThe book's foreword states that this is a true story handed down from Trudy's descendants (Trudy became widely known as an expert spinner, having been taught by her mother who, because of her crippled shoulder, could no longer perform the task).\n\nThe book has been recorded twice, once in 1969 as an audio dramatization by Newbery Awards Records, Inc. (NAR 3005) and once in 2015 by Blackstone Audio read by Mark Turetsky.\n\n"}

The album was released on November 19, 2002, by Rawkus Records. It received wide critical acclaim and had some commercial appeal from the song \"Get By\", produced by Kanye West. \"Kludge\" magazine included it on their list of best albums of 2002.\n\nIn 1998 Talib Kweli and Mos Def as duo Black Star released critically acclaimed album \"Mos Def & Talib Kweli Are Black Star\". The duo planned to release their second album, but Mos Def was busy working on film \"The Italian Job\". Meanwhile, Kweli decided to work on other projects. As part of Reflection Eternal duo with Hi-Tek he released \"Train of Thought\" in 2000. Then, following the success of his previous albums, Kweli decided to release his debut solo album.\n\nThe album was called \"Quality\". In 2002 interview with \"Rolling Stone\" rapper explained the album's name:\n\nAccording to \"Billboard\", the album's title is also a pun on Kweli's similarly pronounced surname.\n\n\"Quality\" was released on November 19, 2002 (November 25 in the UK), by Rawkus Records. Despite Kweli still being considered an underground artist, the album was commercially successful. It peaked at number 21 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and number 6 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. Three singles were released from the album; \"Good to You\"/\"Put It in the Air\", \"Waitin' For The DJ\"/\"Guerilla Monsoon Rap\" and \"Get By\". Despite positive reception, the first two singles failed to make any impact on mainstream charts, so the label decided to not release the third single, considering the song and its content not commercially viable. In response to this, Kweli and his manager made several copies of the single and sent it to a number of popular radio DJs across New York. With help from DJ Enuff, the team at Power 106, and many other local DJs, the single gained popularity through local airplay, and was eventually released by Rawkus. \"Get By\" received radio airplay in early 2003 and charted on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, where it peaked at number 77, becoming Kweli's biggest solo hit. A music video for the song was later released and an official remix was recorded. The remix, featuring Kanye West, Mos Def, Jay Z, and Busta Rhymes, was aired for a short time on New York hip-hop radio, but did not receive an official release.\n\nAfter the release of \"Quality\", Kweli embarked on a tour in support of the album, where he was accompanied by friend and producer Kanye West as an opening act. At the time, West was considered a talented producer, but executives at West's label, Roc-A-Fella, did not feel he had potential as a solo rapper. Kweli allowed West to perform on stage with him during his concerts, giving West his first stage exposure to large crowds. West later expressed his gratitude to Kweli, saying that he owed a part of his early success to these performances.\n\nCredits adapted from the album's liner notes.\nNotes\n\nSample credits\n\nCredits adapted from the album's liner notes.\n"}

Hurricanes forced the rescheduling of two Miami Dolphins home games: the game against the Tennessee Titans was moved up one day to Saturday, September 11 to avoid oncoming Hurricane Ivan, while the game versus the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday, September 26 was moved back 7½ hours to miss the eye of Hurricane Jeanne.\n\nThe playoffs began on January 8, and eventually New England repeated as NFL champions when they defeated the Philadelphia Eagles 24–21 in Super Bowl XXXIX, the Super Bowl championship game, at ALLTEL Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida on February 6.\n\nThe 2004 NFL Draft was held from April 24 to 25, 2004 at New York City's Theater at Madison Square Garden. With the first pick, the San Diego Chargers selected quarterback Eli Manning from the University of Mississippi.\n\nRon Blum returned to line judge, and Bill Vinovich was promoted to take his place as referee.\n\nMidway through the season, Johnny Grier, the NFL's first African-American referee, suffered a leg injury that forced him to retire. He was permanently replaced by the back judge on his crew, Scott Green, who had previous experience as a referee in NFL Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Miami Dolphins were the first team to be eliminated from the playoff race, having reached a 1–9 record by week 11.\n\nThe following teams and players set all-time NFL records during the season:\n\nThe Colts led the NFL with 522 points scored. The Colts tallied more points in the first half of each of their games of the 2004 NFL season (277 points) than seven other NFL teams managed in the entire season. Despite throwing for 49 touchdown passes, Peyton Manning attempted fewer than 500 passes for the first time in his NFL career. The San Francisco 49ers record 420 consecutive scoring games that had started in Week 5 of the 1977 season ended in Week 2 of the season.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The regular season also saw the first ever regular season game played outside the United States, as well as the New Orleans Saints being forced to play elsewhere due to damage to the Superdome and the entire New Orleans area by Hurricane Katrina.\n\nThe playoffs began on January 7. New England's streak of 10 consecutive playoff wins and chance at a third straight Super Bowl title was ended in the Divisional Playoff Round by the Denver Broncos, and eventually the NFL title was won by the Pittsburgh Steelers, who defeated the Seattle Seahawks 21–10 in Super Bowl XL at Ford Field in Detroit, Michigan on February 5 for their fifth Super Bowl win. This also marked the first time that a sixth-seeded team, who by the nature of their seeding would play every game on the road, would advance to and win the Super Bowl.\n\nThe season formally concluded with the Pro Bowl, the league's all-star game, at Aloha Stadium in Honolulu, Hawaii on February 12.\n\nThe 2005 NFL Draft was held from April 23 to 24, 2005 at New York City's Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. With the first pick, the San Francisco 49ers selected quarterback Alex Smith from the University of Utah.\n\n\n\nThe 2005 season also featured the first ever regular season game played outside the United States when a San Francisco 49ers – Arizona Cardinals game was played at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City on October 2 (the Cardinals won 31–14). The game drew an NFL regular season record of 103,467 paid fans. It was a home game for the Cardinals, mostly because the team rarely sold out at their then-home field, Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Arizona. This season was the last year that the Cardinals played at Sun Devil Stadium; the team then moved to their new Cardinals Stadium in nearby Glendale.\n\nDue to the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina to the Louisiana Superdome and the greater New Orleans area, the New Orleans Saints’ entire 2005 home schedule was played at different venues while the Saints set up temporary operations in San Antonio, Texas. The Saints’ first home game scheduled for September 18 against the New York Giants was moved to September 19 at Giants Stadium, where the Giants won 27–10. The impromptu “Monday Night doubleheader” with the game already scheduled (Washington Redskins at Dallas Cowboys) was a success, and was made a permanent part of the schedule the next year when Monday Night Football made the move to ESPN.\n\nAs a result of the unscheduled doubleheader, the NFL designated its second weekend, September 18 and 19, as “Hurricane Relief Weekend’, with fund raising collections at all of the league's games. The Saints’ remaining home games were split between the Alamodome in San Antonio and Louisiana State University's Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Being forced to travel to 13 of their 16 games (only 3 of their games were actually played in the same city where they practiced) and practice in substandard facilities and conditions in San Antonio, the Saints finished 3–13, their worst season since 1999.\n\nThe last time an NFL franchise had to play at an alternate site was in 2002, when the Chicago Bears played home games in Champaign, Illinois, 120 miles (200 km) away, due to the reconstruction of Soldier Field. The last NFL team to abandon their home city during a season was the hapless 1952 Dallas Texans, whose franchise was returned to the league after drawing several poor crowds at the Cotton Bowl. They played their final “home” game at the Rubber Bowl in Akron, Ohio, against the Bears on Thanksgiving; the Texans stunned the Bears, 27–23, in front of a crowd estimated at 3,000, for their only win of the season.\n\nThe Sunday, October 23 game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Miami Dolphins at Dolphins Stadium was rescheduled to Friday, October 21 at 7:00 pm EDT to beat Hurricane Wilma's arrival to the Miami, Florida area. The Chiefs won the game, 30–20, and became the first visiting team to travel and play on the same day. Since the game was planned for Sunday afternoon, it is one of the few times in history that the Dolphins wore their road jerseys in a home game played at night.\n\n\nThe following teams and players set all-time NFL records during the season:\n\n\n\nThe New Orleans Saints played in Baton Rouge’s Tiger Stadium for four games and in San Antonio's Alamodome for three games due to Louisiana Superdome damaged by Hurricane Katrina. Tiger Stadium’s goalposts did not conform to NFL standards due to (a) two supports instead of one and (b) white paint instead of gold. The NFL granted the Saints dispensation to keep LSU's goalposts in place for their games.\n\nIn addition, with the RCA and Edward Jones domes both removing their AstroTurf surfaces in favor of the newer next-generation FieldTurf surface, the old first-generation AstroTurf surface ceased to be used in the NFL.\n\nPro Player Stadium was renamed Dolphins Stadium. Pro Player's parent Fruit of the Loom had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection back in 1999, and the Pro Player label was discontinued, but that stadium name was kept for several more years.\n\n\nThis marked the final season that ABC held the rights to televise \"Monday Night Football\" after thirty-six years of airing the series. When the TV contracts were renewed near the end of the season, the rights to broadcast \"Monday Night Football\" were awarded to Disney-owned corporate sibling ESPN. NBC bought the right to televise \"Sunday Night Football\", marking the first time that the network broadcast NFL games since Super Bowl XXXII in 1998. Meanwhile, CBS and Fox renewed their television contracts to the American Football Conference and the National Football Conference packages, respectively.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2296140", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2296140", "title": "Rafael Guastavino", "text": "Rafael Guastavino\n\nRafael Guastavino Moreno (; March 1, 1842 February 1, 1908) was a Spanish building engineer and builder who immigrated to the United States in 1881; his career for the next three decades was based in New York City. \n\nBased on the Catalan vault, he created the Guastavino tile, a \"Tile Arch System\", patented in the United States in 1885, which was used for constructing robust, self-supporting arches and architectural vaults using interlocking terracotta tiles and layers of mortar. His work appears in numerous prominent projects designed by major architectural firms in New York and other cities of the Northeast. Guastavino tile is found in some of New York's most prominent Beaux-Arts landmarks and in major buildings across the United States. It is also used in numerous architecturally important and famous buildings with vaulted spaces. \n\nIn 1881 Guastavino came to New York City from Valencia, with his youngest son, nine-year-old Rafael III. In Spain he had been an accomplished architect and was a contemporary of Antoni Gaudí. In the March 7, 1885 article entitled \"The Dakota Apartment House\", printed in \"The Real Estate Record and Builders Guide\", Guastavino was identified as the contractor in charge of \"fireproof construction\" of the luxury apartment building, which was completed in 1884. Though not specified, the work may very well have included the groined vault entries on the south side on West 72nd Street, and the north side on West 73rd Street, as well as the construction of the subterranean basement, and the 3-foot thick arched floors between the basement and attic levels. \n\nGuastavino was commissioned by the firm of McKim, Mead, and White for their Boston Public Library (1889), which increased his reputation with every major architect on the East Coast. His published drawings of interior decoration of the Spanish Renaissance style caught the eye of an architect, who asked him to submit a design for the planned New York Progress Club building. After forming a partnership with William Blodgett, Guastavino eventually was offered a construction position in 1890 with George W. Vanderbilt to construct arches for the new mansion, \"Biltmore\" at Asheville, North Carolina.\n\nAfter working on the estate, Guastavino decided to build his own retirement home in the mountains of Black Mountain, North Carolina in a 500-acre valley. His property, \"Rhododendron\", also had a vineyard, dairy, brick kiln, and more. This property currently is owned by Christmount Assembly, the conference center for the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). The property holds artifacts that may be visited, including the kiln and chimney, a wine cellar, beautiful old stone walls, and many smaller structures that have been rediscovered as modern buildings have been constructed there.\n\nGuastavino and his son also developed twenty-four products that were awarded patents. Their company, Guastavino Fireproof Construction Company, run by the father and then by his son, was incorporated in 1889. It executed its final contract in 1962. Akoustolith was one of several trade names used by Guastavino.\n\nHundreds of major building projects incorporate the distinctive Tile Arch System. In Chicago, the central nave vaulting of Rockefeller Chapel at the University of Chicago uses 100,000 Guastavino tiles. In Boston, Guastavino tiles are found in the Boston Public Library; in New York City, in the Grand Central Terminal, Grant's Tomb, Carnegie Hall, the American Museum of Natural History, Congregation Emanu-El of New York, and St. Bartolomew's Episcopal Church; and in Washington, D.C. in the U.S. Supreme Court building and the National Museum of Natural History on the National Mall. Guastavino tiles form the domes of Philadelphia's St. Francis de Sales Roman Catholic Church. At Pittsburgh's Union Station, the vaulting of the carriage turnaround is a Guastavino tile system. In Nebraska, the tiles may be seen in the Nebraska State Capitol.\n\nIn 1900, New York architects Heins & LaFarge hired Guastavino to help construct City Hall station, the underground showpiece for the IRT, the first part of the then-new New York City Subway. The station, although elegant, was never convenient or popular, as it was superseded by nearby stops with connections to Brooklyn. After the city closed it in 1945 because needed upgrades were too expensive, it became a legendary abandoned Manhattan underground relic. Subway buffs and urban spelunkers knew about it. Guastavino also installed the ceiling of the south arcade of the Manhattan Municipal Building, which was constructed during 1907-1914.\n\nThe Guastavinos had entered New York as immigrants via Ellis Island. In 1917 the younger Rafael Guastavino III was commissioned to rebuild the ceiling of the Ellis Island Great Hall. The Guastavinos set 28,832 tiles into a self-supporting interlocking -high ceiling grid so durable and strong that during the restoration project of the 1980s, as many sources repeat, only seventeen of those tiles needed replacing.\n\nThe largest dome created by the Guastavino Company was over the central crossing for the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan: it is in diameter and high. This dome was intended to be a temporary structure, to be replaced by a high central tower. In 2009 this \"temporary\" fix celebrated the 100th anniversary of its construction. Guastavino received this contract due to the much lower price he could quote because his system served as its own scaffolding. This was an extreme test of his system, however. The masons had to work from above, each day adding a few rows of tiles, and standing on the previous day's work to make progress. At the edges, many layers of tile were laid, and the dome thins as it rises toward the center.\n\nFew structures designed and built by Guastavino alone have been identified. He was responsible for a series of surviving rowhouses with unusual Mooresque features on West 78th Street (121–131 known as the \"red and whites\"), on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Another of his structures, now used as an event space called Guastavino's, is located under the Midtown Manhattan end of the Queensboro Bridge. His son Rafael's Mediterranean villa (1912), built entirely of Guastavino tiles, still stands on Awixa Avenue, in Bay Shore, Long Island.\n\nAfter working on a commission at the Biltmore Estate, Guastavino retired to Black Mountain. \n\nThe site of his estate is now used as Christmount, the conference and retreat center of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). Ruins of the original Guastavino Estate still stand, and a collection of Guastavino memorabilia is held in the Christmount library. The Rafael Guastavino, Sr., Estate was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.\n\nIn North Carolina Guastavino completed a number of projects: his work is found in Duke Chapel in Durham, the Jefferson Standard Building in Greensboro, the Motley Memorial in Chapel Hill, and Basilica Shrine of St. Mary in Wilmington. He is buried in the crypt of the Basilica of St. Lawrence, Asheville, which he designed in 1905.\n\n\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\n\n"}

The 67-lap race was the twelfth round of the 2005 Formula One season. Renault driver Fernando Alonso won the race, taking his sixth victory of the season, whilst Juan Pablo Montoya finished second for the McLaren team.

This meant that Fernando Alonso inherited first position. It was Räikkönen's fifth consecutive retirement at the circuit. Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello suffered from the poor durability of the Bridgestone tyres on their Ferraris again, particularly Schumacher who had chosen a softer compound. This allowed Jenson Button to overtake Schumacher to take second place, although he quickly pitted, allowing Montoya take gain the position. Montoya then managed to stay ahead of Button after his own second stop. In the final laps of the race, Schumacher's problems allowed Giancarlo Fisichella to take his fourth place.

{"id": "2296159", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2296159", "title": "Powder diffraction", "text": "Powder diffraction\n\nPowder diffraction is a scientific technique using X-ray, neutron, or electron diffraction on powder or microcrystalline samples for structural characterization of materials. An instrument dedicated to performing such powder measurements is called a powder diffractometer.\n\nPowder diffraction stands in contrast to single crystal diffraction techniques, which work best with a single, well-ordered crystal.\n\nA diffractometer produces waves at a known frequency, which is determined by their source. The source is often x-rays, because they are the only kind of energy with the correct frequency for inter-atomic-scale diffraction. However, electrons and neutrons are also common sources, with their frequency determined by their de Broglie wavelength. When these waves reach the sample, the incoming beam is either reflected off the surface, or can enter the lattice and be diffracted by the atoms present in the sample. If the atoms are arranged symmetrically with a separation distance d, these waves will interfere constructively only where the path-length difference 2dsinθ is equal to an integer multiple of the wavelength, producing a diffraction maximum in accordance with Bragg's law. These waves interfere destructively at points between the intersections where the waves are out of phase, and do not lead to bright spots in the diffraction pattern. Because the sample itself is acting as the diffraction grating, this spacing is the atomic spacing.\n\nThe distinction between powder and single crystal diffraction is the degree of texturing in the sample. Single crystals have maximal texturing, and are said to be anisotropic. In contrast, in powder diffraction, every possible crystalline orientation is represented equally in a powdered sample, the isotropic case. PXRD operates under the assumption that the sample is randomly arranged. Therefore, a statistically significant number of each plane of the crystal structure will be in the proper orientation to diffract the X-rays. Therefore, each plane will be represented in the signal. In practice, it is sometimes necessary to rotate the sample orientation to eliminate the effects of texturing and achieve true randomness.\n\nMathematically, crystals can be described by a Bravais lattice with some regularity in the spacing between atoms. Because of this regularity, we can describe this structure in a different way using the reciprocal lattice, which is related to the original structure by a Fourier transform. This three-dimensional space can be described with reciprocal axes x*, y*, and z* or alternatively in spherical coordinates q, φ*, and χ*. In powder diffraction, intensity is homogeneous over φ* and χ*, and only q remains as an important measurable quantity. This is because orientational averaging causes the three-dimensional reciprocal space that is studied in single crystal diffraction to be projected onto a single dimension.\n\nWhen the scattered radiation is collected on a flat plate detector, the rotational averaging leads to smooth diffraction rings around the beam axis, rather than the discrete Laue spots observed in single crystal diffraction. The angle between the beam axis and the ring is called the \"scattering angle\" and in X-ray crystallography always denoted as 2θ (in scattering of \"visible\" light the convention is usually to call it θ). In accordance with Bragg's law, each ring corresponds to a particular reciprocal lattice vector G in the sample crystal. This leads to the definition of the scattering vector as:\n\nIn this equation, G is the reciprocal lattice vector, q is the length of the reciprocal lattice vector, k is the momentum transfer vector, θ is half of the scattering angle, and λ is the wavelength of the source. Powder diffraction data are usually presented as a diffractogram in which the diffracted intensity, I, is shown as a function either of the scattering angle 2θ or as a function of the scattering vector length q. The latter variable has the advantage that the diffractogram no longer depends on the value of the wavelength λ. The advent of synchrotron sources has widened the choice of wavelength considerably. To facilitate comparability of data obtained with different wavelengths the use of q is therefore recommended and gaining acceptability.\n\nRelative to other methods of analysis, powder diffraction allows for rapid, non-destructive analysis of multi-component mixtures without the need for extensive sample preparation. This gives laboratories around the world the ability to quickly analyze unknown materials and perform materials characterization in such fields as metallurgy, mineralogy, chemistry, forensic science, archeology, condensed matter physics, and the biological and pharmaceutical sciences. Identification is performed by comparison of the diffraction pattern to a known standard or to a database such as the International Centre for Diffraction Data's Powder Diffraction File (PDF) or the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD). Advances in hardware and software, particularly improved optics and fast detectors, have dramatically improved the analytical capability of the technique, especially relative to the speed of the analysis. The fundamental physics upon which the technique is based provides high precision and accuracy in the measurement of interplanar spacings, sometimes to fractions of an Ångström, resulting in authoritative identification frequently used in patents, criminal cases and other areas of law enforcement. The ability to analyze multiphase materials also allows analysis of how materials interact in a particular matrix such as a pharmaceutical tablet, a circuit board, a mechanical weld, a geologic core sampling, cement and concrete, or a pigment found in an historic painting. The method has been historically used for the identification and classification of minerals, but it can be used for nearly any material, even amorphous ones, so long as a suitable reference pattern is known or can be constructed.\n\nThe most widespread use of powder diffraction is in the identification and characterization of crystalline solids, each of which produces a distinctive diffraction pattern. Both the positions (corresponding to lattice spacings) and the relative intensity of the lines in a diffraction pattern are indicative of a particular phase and material, providing a \"fingerprint\" for comparison. A multi-phase mixture, e.g. a soil sample, will show more than one pattern superposed, allowing for determination of the relative concentrations of phases in the mixture.\n\nJ.D. Hanawalt, an analytical chemist who worked for Dow Chemical in the 1930s, was the first to realize the analytical potential of creating a database. Today it is represented by the Powder Diffraction File (PDF) of the International Centre for Diffraction Data (formerly Joint Committee for Powder Diffraction Studies). This has been made searchable by computer through the work of global software developers and equipment manufacturers. There are now over 871,000 reference materials in the 2018 Powder Diffraction File Databases, and these databases are interfaced to a wide variety of diffraction analysis software and distributed globally. The Powder Diffraction File contains many subfiles, such as minerals, metals and alloys, pharmaceuticals, forensics, excipients, superconductors, semiconductors, etc., with large collections of organic, organometallic and inorganic reference materials.\n\nIn contrast to a crystalline pattern consisting of a series of sharp peaks, amorphous materials (liquids, glasses etc.) produce a broad background signal. Many polymers show semicrystalline behavior, \"i.e.\" part of the material forms an ordered crystallite by folding of the molecule. A single polymer molecule may well be folded into two different, adjacent crystallites and thus form a tie between the two. The tie part is prevented from crystallizing. The result is that the crystallinity will never reach 100%. Powder XRD can be used to determine the crystallinity by comparing the integrated intensity of the background pattern to that of the sharp peaks. Values obtained from powder XRD are typically comparable but not quite identical to those obtained from other methods such as DSC.\n\nThe position of a diffraction peak is independent of the atomic positions within the cell and entirely determined by the size and shape of the unit cell of the crystalline phase. Each peak represents a certain lattice plane and can therefore be characterized by a Miller index. If the symmetry is high, e.g.: cubic or hexagonal it is usually not too hard to identify the index of each peak, even for an unknown phase. This is particularly important in solid-state chemistry, where one is interested in finding and identifying new materials. Once a pattern has been indexed, this characterizes the reaction product and identifies it as a new solid phase. Indexing programs exist to deal with the harder cases, but if the unit cell is very large and the symmetry low (triclinic) success is not always guaranteed.\n\nCell parameters are somewhat temperature and pressure dependent. Powder diffraction can be combined with \"in situ\" temperature and pressure control. As these thermodynamic variables are changed, the observed diffraction peaks will migrate continuously to indicate higher or lower lattice spacings as the unit cell distorts. This allows for measurement of such quantities as the thermal expansion tensor and the isothermal bulk modulus, as well determination of the full equation of state of the material.\n\nAt some critical set of conditions, for example 0 °C for water at 1 atm, a new arrangement of atoms or molecules may become stable, leading to a phase transition. At this point new diffraction peaks will appear or old ones disappear according to the symmetry of the new phase. If the material melts to an isotropic liquid, all sharp lines will disappear and be replaced by a broad amorphous pattern. If the transition produces another crystalline phase, one set of lines will suddenly be replaced by another set. In some cases however lines will split or coalesce, e.g. if the material undergoes a continuous, second order phase transition. In such cases the symmetry may change because the existing structure is \"distorted\" rather than replaced by a completely different one. For example, the diffraction peaks for the lattice planes (100) and (001) can be found at two different values of q for a tetragonal phase, but if the symmetry becomes cubic the two peaks will come to coincide.\n\nCrystal structure determination from powder diffraction data is extremely challenging due to the overlap of reflections in a powder experiment. A number of different methods exist for structural determination, such as simulated annealing and charge flipping. The crystal structures of known materials can be refined, i.e. as a function of temperature or pressure, using the Rietveld method. The Rietveld method is a so-called full pattern analysis technique. A crystal structure, together with instrumental and microstructural information, is used to generate a theoretical diffraction pattern that can be compared to the observed data. A least squares procedure is then used to minimize the difference between the calculated pattern and each point of the observed pattern by adjusting model parameters. Techniques to determine unknown structures from powder data do exist, but are somewhat specialized. A number of programs that can be used in structure determination are TOPAS, Fox, DASH, GSAS, EXPO2004, and a few others.\n\nThere are many factors that determine the width B of a diffraction peak. These include:\n\nIt is often possible to separate the effects of size and strain. When size broadening is independent of q (K=1/d), strain broadening increases with increasing q-values. In most cases there will be both size and strain broadening. It is possible to separate these by combining the two equations in what is known as the Hall–Williamson method:\n\nThus, when we plot formula_3 vs. formula_4 we get a straight line with slope formula_5 and intercept formula_6.\n\nThe expression is a combination of the Scherrer equation for size broadening and the Stokes and Wilson expression for strain broadening. The value of η is the strain in the crystallites, the value of D represents the size of the crystallites. The constant \"k\" is typically close to unity and ranges from 0.8 to 1.39.\n\nX-ray photons scatter by interaction with the electron cloud of the material, neutrons are scattered by the nuclei. This means that, in the presence of heavy atoms with many electrons, it may be difficult to detect light atoms by X-ray diffraction. In contrast, the neutron scattering lengths of most atoms are approximately equal in magnitude. Neutron diffraction techniques may therefore be used to detect light elements such as oxygen or hydrogen in combination with heavy atoms. The neutron diffraction technique therefore has obvious applications to problems such as determining oxygen displacements in materials like high temperature superconductors and ferroelectrics, or to hydrogen bonding in biological systems.\n\nA further complication in the case of neutron scattering from hydrogenous materials is the strong incoherent scattering of hydrogen (80.27(6) barn). This leads to a very high background in neutron diffraction experiments, and may make structural investigations impossible. A common solution is deuteration, i.e., replacing the 1-H atoms in the sample with deuterium (2-H). The incoherent scattering length of deuterium is much smaller (2.05(3) barn) making structural investigations significantly easier. However, in some systems, replacing hydrogen with deuterium may alter the structural and dynamic properties of interest.\n\nAs neutrons also have a magnetic moment, they are additionally scattered by any magnetic moments in a sample. In the case of long range magnetic order, this leads to the appearance of new Bragg reflections. In most simple cases, powder diffraction may be used to determine the size of the moments and their spatial orientation.\n\nPredicting the scattered intensity in powder diffraction patterns from gases, liquids, and randomly distributed nano-clusters in the solid state is (to first order) done rather elegantly with the Debye scattering equation:\n\nwhere the magnitude of the scattering vector \"q\" is in reciprocal lattice distance units, \"N\" is the number of atoms, \"f\"(\"q\") is the atomic scattering factor for atom \"i\" and scattering vector \"q\", while \"r\" is the distance between atom \"i\" and atom \"j\". One can also use this to predict the effect of nano-crystallite shape on detected diffraction peaks, even if in some directions the cluster is only one atom thick.\n\nThe simplest cameras for X-ray powder diffraction consist of a small capillary and either a flat plate detector (originally a piece of X-ray film, now more and more a flat-plate detector or a CCD-camera) or a cylindrical one (originally a piece of film in a cookie-jar, but increasingly bent position sensitive detectors are used). The two types of cameras are known as the Laue and the Debye–Scherrer camera.\n\nIn order to ensure complete powder averaging, the capillary is usually spun around its axis.\n\nFor neutron diffraction vanadium cylinders are used as sample holders. Vanadium has a negligible absorption and coherent scattering cross section for neutrons and is hence nearly invisible in a powder diffraction experiment. Vanadium does however have a considerable incoherent scattering cross section which may cause problems for more sensitive techniques such as neutron inelastic scattering.\n\nA later development in X-ray cameras is the Guinier camera. It is built around a \"focusing\" bent crystal monochromator. The sample is usually placed in the focusing beam, e.g. as a dusting on a piece of sticky tape. A cylindrical piece of film (or electronic multichannel detector) is put on the focusing circle, but the incident beam prevented from reaching the detector to prevent damage from its high intensity.\n\nCameras based on hybrid photon counting technology, such as the PILATUS detector, are widely used in applications where high data acquisition speeds and increased data quality are required.\n\nDiffractometers can be operated both in transmission and reflection, but reflection is more common. The powder sample is loaded in a small disc-like container and its surface carefully flattened. The disc is put on one axis of the diffractometer and tilted by an angle θ while a detector (scintillation counter) rotates around it on an arm at twice this angle.\nThis configuration is known under the name Bragg–Brentano θ-2θ.\n\nAnother configuration is the Bragg–Brentano θ-θ configuration in which the sample is stationary while the X-ray tube and the detector are rotated around it. The angle formed between the tube and the detector is 2θ. This configuration is most convenient for loose powders.\n\nPosition-sensitive detectors (PSD) and area detectors, which allow collection from multiple angles at once, are becoming more popular on currently supplied instrumentation.\n\nSources that produce a neutron beam of suitable intensity and speed for diffraction are only available at a small number of research reactors and spallation sources in the world. Angle dispersive (fixed wavelength) instruments typically have a battery of individual detectors arranged in a cylindrical fashion around the sample holder, and can therefore collect scattered intensity simultaneously on a large 2θ range. Time of flight instruments normally have a small range of banks at different scattering angles which collect data at varying resolutions.\n\nLaboratory X-ray diffraction equipment relies on the use of an X-ray tube, which is used to produce the X-rays. The most commonly used laboratory X-ray tube uses a copper anode, but cobalt and molybdenum are also popular. The wavelength in nm varies for each source. The table below shows these wavelengths, determined by Bearden and quoted in the International Tables for X-ray Crystallography (all values in nm):\nAccording to the last re-examination of Holzer et al. (1997), these values are respectively:\n\nIn-house applications of X-ray diffraction has always been limited to the relatively few wavelengths shown in the table above. The available choice was much needed because the combination of certain wavelengths and certain elements present in a sample can lead to strong fluorescence which increases the background in the diffraction pattern. A notorious example is the presence of iron in a sample when using copper radiation. In general elements just below the anode element in the period system need to be avoided.\n\nAnother limitation is that the intensity of traditional generators is relatively low, requiring lengthy exposure times and precluding any time dependent measurement. The advent of synchrotron sources has drastically changed this picture and caused powder diffraction methods to enter a whole new phase of development. Not only is there a much wider choice of wavelengths available, the high brilliance of the synchrotron radiation makes it possible to observe changes in the pattern during chemical reactions, temperature ramps, changes in pressure and the like.\n\nThe tunability of the wavelength also makes it possible to observe anomalous scattering effects when the wavelength is chosen close to the absorption edge of one of the elements of the sample.\n\nNeutron diffraction has never been an in house technique because it requires the availability of an intense neutron beam only available at a nuclear reactor or spallation source. Typically the available neutron flux, and the weak interaction between neutrons and matter, require relative large samples.\n\nAlthough it is possible to solve crystal structures from powder X-ray data alone, its single crystal analogue is a far more powerful technique for structure determination. This is directly related to the fact that information is lost by the collapse of the 3D space onto a 1D axis. Nevertheless, powder X-ray diffraction is a powerful and useful technique in its own right. It is mostly used to characterize and identify \"phases\", and to refine details of an already known structure, rather than solving unknown structures.\n\nAdvantages of the technique are:\n\nBy contrast growth and mounting of large single crystals is notoriously difficult. In fact there are many materials for which, despite many attempts, it has not proven possible to obtain single crystals. Many materials are readily available with sufficient microcrystallinity for powder diffraction, or samples may be easily ground from larger crystals. In the field of solid-state chemistry that often aims at synthesizing \"new\" materials, single crystals thereof are typically not immediately available. Powder diffraction is therefore one of the most powerful methods to identify and characterize new materials in this field.\n\nParticularly for neutron diffraction, which requires larger samples than X-ray diffraction due to a relatively weak scattering cross section, the ability to use large samples can be critical, although newer and more brilliant neutron sources are being built that may change this picture.\n\nSince all possible crystal orientations are measured simultaneously, collection times can be quite short even for small and weakly scattering samples. This is not merely convenient, but can be essential for samples which are unstable either inherently or under X-ray or neutron bombardment, or for time-resolved studies. For the latter it is desirable to have a strong radiation source. The advent of synchrotron radiation and modern neutron sources has therefore done much to revitalize the powder diffraction field because it is now possible to study temperature dependent changes, reaction kinetics and so forth by means of time-resolved powder diffraction.\n\n"}

It is located within the boundaries of the constellation of Aquarius. It is a member of the Local Group of galaxies, albeit an extremely isolated one; it is one of only a few known Local Group members for which a past close approach to the Milky Way or Andromeda Galaxy can be ruled out, based on its current location and velocity.\n\nLocal Group membership was firmly established only in 1999, with the derivation of a distance based on the tip of the red-giant branch method. Its distance from the Milky Way of 3.2 ±0.2 Mly (980 ±40 kpc) means that Aquarius Dwarf is quite isolated in space. It is one of the least luminous Local Group galaxies to contain significant amounts of neutral hydrogen and support to ongoing star formation, although it does so only at an extremely low level.\nBecause of its large distance, the Hubble Space Telescope is required in order to study its stellar populations in detail. RR Lyrae stars have been discovered in Aquarius Dwarf, indicating the existence of stars more than 10 billion years old, but the majority of its stars are much younger (median age 6.8 billion years). Among Local Group galaxies, only Leo A has a younger mean age, leading to the suggestion that delayed star formation could be correlated with galaxy isolation.\n"}
